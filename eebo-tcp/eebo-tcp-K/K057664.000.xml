            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>LETTER to Lord MANSFIELD.</head>
            <p>AN author, not more illuſtrious by birth than by genius, ſays, in a letter concerning enthuſiaſm, <q rend="inline">"That he had ſo much need of ſome conſiderable preſence or company to raiſe his thoughts on any occaſion, that when alone he endeavoured to ſupply that want by fancying ſome great man of ſuperior genius, whoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd preſence might inſpire him with more than what he felt at ordinary hours."</q> To judge from his Lordſhip's writings, this receipt muſt be a good one. It naturally ought to be ſo; and I imagine that I have more than once felt its enlivening influence. With reſpect to the firſt edition of this treatiſe in particular, I can affirm with great truth, that <hi>a great man of ſuperior genius</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of my view: Will Lord Mansfield reliſh this paſſage—How would he have expreſſed it—were my conſtant queſtions.</p>
            <p>BUT though by this means I commanded more vigour of mind, and a keener exertion of thought, than I am capable of <hi>at ordinary hours;</hi> yet I had not courage to mention this to his Lordſhip, nor to the world. The ſubject I had undertaken was new: I could not hope to eſcape errors, perhaps groſs ones; and the abſurdity appear'd glaring, of acknowledging a ſort of inſpiration in a performance that might not exhibit the leaſt ſpark of it.</p>
            <p>No trouble has been declined upon the preſent edition; and yet that the work, even in its improved ſtate, deſerves his Lordſhip's patronage, I am far from being confident. But however that be, it is no longer in my power to conceal, that the ambition of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord Mansfield's approbation has been my chief ſupport in this work. Never to reveal that ſecret would be to border upon ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Will your Lordſhip permit me to ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AN author who exerts his talents and induſtry upon a new ſubject, without hope of aſſiſtance from others, is too apt to flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his performance; becauſe he finds no other work of the kind to humble him by compariſon. The attempt to digeſt equity into a regular ſyſtem, was not only new, but difficult; and for theſe reaſons the author hopes he may be excuſed for not diſcovering more early ſeveral imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the firſt edition of this book. Theſe imperfections, when diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, gave him the greater pain, becauſe they concern chiefly the arrangement, in which every miſtake muſt be attended with ſome degree of obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. No labour has been ſpared to improve the preſent edition: and yet, after all his endeavours, the author dare not hope that every imperfection is cured: that the arrangement is conſiderably improved, is all that with aſſurance he can take upon him to pronounce.</p>
            <p>For an interim gratification of the reader's curioſity before entering upon the work, a few particulars ſhall here be mentioned. The defects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law ſeemed to be ſo diſtinct from its exceſſes, as to make it proper to handle theſe articles ſeparately; which accordingly is done in the firſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But almoſt as ſoon as the printing was finiſhed, it occurred to the author as evidence of an unſkilful diſtribution, that he had been obliged to handle the ſame ſubject in different parts of the book, or at leaſt to refer from one part to another. This led him to reflect, that theſe defects and exceſſes proceed both of them equally from the very conſtitution of a court of common law, which is confined within narrow bounds in its power of doing juſtice; and therefore it now appeared evident that they ought to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled promiſcuouſly as ſo many examples of imperfection in common law, which ought to be ſupplied by a court of equity. So evident is this, that even in the ſame caſe we find common law ſometimes defective, ſometimes exceſſive, according to occaſional or accidental circumſtances, without any fundamental difference. For example, many claims, good at common law, are reprobated in equity becauſe of ſome incident wrong that comes not
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0743600300:4"/>
under the cogniſance of common law. A claim of this kind muſt be ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a court of common law, which cannot regard the incident wrong; and in ſuch inſtances common law is exceſſive, by tranſgreſſing the bounds of juſtice. On the other hand, where a claim for reparation is brought by the perſon who ſuffered the wrong, a court of common law can give no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; and in ſuch inſtances common law is defective. And yet the <hi>ratio decidendi</hi> is preciſely the ſame in both caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the limited power of a court of common law.</p>
            <p>The tranſgreſſion of a deed or covenant is a wrong that ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from a wrong that miſleads a man to make a covenant or to grant a deed. The former only belongs to the chapter <hi>Of Covenants;</hi> the latter, to the chapter <hi>Of the powers of a court of equity to protect individuals from injuries.</hi> For example, a man is fraudulently induced to enter into a contract: the reparation of this wrong, which is antecedent to the contract, cannot ariſe from the contract; and for that reaſon it is put under the chapter laſt mentioned.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>quaeſtio voluntatis</hi> muſt ariſe from imperfection or obſcurity in the words by which will is declared: therefore all ſuch queſtions ought to come under the firſt ſection of the chapter <hi>Of deeds and covenants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a ſtrict review of this book for a new edition, the neceſſary of refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring frequently to other books for the principles of morality, indicated a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective performance. To ſupply that defect, and to make the work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in itſelf, there is added to this edition a preliminary diſcourſe, of which the purpoſe is, to open up briefly and diſtinctly the fountains of juſtice and equity, from whence are derived all the equitable rules employ'd in this work; avoiding carefully to teaſe the reader with controverſy, or any criticiſms upon former writers. The author flatters himſelf that this part of the work will give ſatisfaction; and ſuppoſing it to be well executed, it cannot fail of being both pleaſant and uſeful.</p>

               <p>THE ſcience of morality hath for its ſubject, human actions, with their effects; and its end or purpoſe is, to regulate theſe actions.</p>
               <p>To act by inſtinct ſignifies, to act by blind impulſe, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any end in view. The brute creatures act generally by inſtinct: the inſtinct of hunger prompts them to eat, and of cold to take ſhelter, without conſidering what theſe actions may produce. The ſame muſt be the condition of infants: for infants are not capable of any conſideration: they apply to the nipple, without foreſeeing that this action will relieve them from hunger; and they cry when pained, without having any view of procuring relief. But as ſoon as our ripened faculties unfold to us the connection between our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and their effects, then it is that we begin to act with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to produce certain effects; and our actions, in that caſe, are means employ'd to bring about the effects intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> though generally reckoned ſynonymous terms, ſignify different operations of the mind: will is relative to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal action; for we never act without a will to act: intention is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the effect; for we act in order to bring about the effect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. It is my intention, for example, to relieve a certain perſon from diſtreſs by giving money: as ſoon as I ſee that perſon, it is my will to deliver the money: the external act of delivery follows: and the perſon is relieved; which is the effect intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0743600300:11"/>
Some effects proceed neceſſarily from the action. A wound is an effect neceſſarily connected with the action of ſtabbing a man with a ſharp weapon: death is the neceſſary effect of throwing a perſon downward from the battlements of a high tower. Some effects are probable only: I labour, for example, in order to provide for my family; fight for my country, in order to repel its enemies; take phyſic, in order to reſtore my health. In ſuch caſes, the event in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended does not neceſſarily nor always follow.</p>
               <p>A man, when he wills to act, muſt at the ſame time intend to produce the effect that he knows to be neceſſarily connected with the action. But where the effect is probable only, a man may proceed to act without intending to produce the effect that follows. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a ſtone I throw at random into the market-place, may wound a man without my intending that effect.</p>
               <p>Inſtinctive actions, from their very definition, exclude intention: actions that neceſſarily produce their effects, muſt imply intention: effects that are probable only, not neceſſary, are ſometimes intended, ſometimes not.</p>
               <p>A <hi>right</hi> and a <hi>wrong,</hi> in ſuch actions as are done intentionally to produce ſome effect, are univerſally acknowledged; and yet philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have been much difficulted to aſſign the cauſe of this eminent diſtinction. The various opinions that have been entertained about it, would be a delicate hiſtorical morſel; but come not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of this ſhort inquiry. I ſhall only obſerve, negatively, that the ſcience of morals cannot be founded on any truths that may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by reaſoning: which will thus appear. As the faculty of reaſon is confined to the inveſtigation of unknown truths by means of truths that are known, it is clear, that in no ſcience can we even begin to reaſon, till we be provided with ſome <hi>data</hi> to found our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings upon: even in mathematics, there are certain principles or axioms perceived intuitively to be true, upon which all its demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations are founded. Reaſon is indeed of great uſe in morality, as well as in other ſciences; but morality, like mathematics, is and muſt be provided with certain axioms or intuitive propoſitions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot make a ſingle ſtep in our reaſonings upon that ſubject; and to trace theſe with care and caution is the chief pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the preſent inquiry.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. The Moral Senſe.</head>
                  <p>WHEN we reflect upon the different branches of ſcience, it might ſeem, that of all ſubjects human nature ſhould be the beſt underſtood; becauſe every man has daily opportunities to ſtudy it in his own paſſions, and in his own actions. But human nature, an intereſting ſubject, is ſeldom left to the cool inveſtigations of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. Writers of a ſweet diſpoſition, inflamed with a warm imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, compoſe man moſtly or wholly of benevolent principles: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of a cold temperament and narrow views, bring him down to be an animal entirely ſelfiſh. Theſe ſyſtems are equally diſtant from truth: man is of a complex nature, endued with various prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſome ſelfiſh ſome ſocial; and it is highly expedient that man ſhould be ſo framed, in order to act the part that is allotted him in this life. The unhappy progreſs of ſelfiſhneſs, eſpecially among commercial nations, is a favourite topic of declamation; and facts are accumulated without end to inforce that topic. It would be no difficult taſk to produce inſtances, not leſs numerous, of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, generoſity, and diſintereſtedneſs. In the midſt of theſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite inſtances, what can any ſenſible perſon fairly conclude, but that the ſocial and ſelfiſh principles are, by divine wiſdom, ſo blended as to fit man for his preſent ſtate? But ſuppoſing ſelfiſhneſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in action, it certainly prevails not in ſentiment, nor in affection: all men equally conſpire to put a high eſtimation upon generoſity, benevolence, and other ſocial qualities; while even the moſt ſelfiſh are diſguſted with ſelfiſhneſs in others, and can ſcarce be reconciled to it in themſelves. Another fact, equally worthy of attention, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the ſame cauſe with the former. Laying aſide particular prejudices ariſing from love or hatred, good fortune happening to any one is agreeable to all, and bad fortune happening to any one is diſagreeable to all. Hence effects or events, whether produced by the operation of the laws of matter, or by the actions of ſelf-motive beings, may be diſtinguiſhed into three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> agreeable, diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and indifferent. Beneficial effects or events are agreeable: hurtful effects or events are diſagreeable: and thoſe that are neither beneficial nor hurtful, are indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Theſe preliminaries lead directly to the true foundation of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0743600300:13"/>
which foundation is diſcovered upon taking under conſideration effects or events produced by human actions. An agreeable effect or event produced intentionally by acting, is perceived by all to be <hi>good</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Hence the intimate connection between morality and the fine arts. <q rend="inline">"It has always been my opinion,"</q> ſays a celebrated writer, <q rend="inline">"that the good and the agreeable are nearly related; and that a mind ſenſible to the charms of virtue, muſt equally be ſenſible to thoſe of beauty."</q>
                     </note>: a diſagreeable effect or event produced intentionally by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is perceived by all to be <hi>ill:</hi> and an indifferent effect or event is not in our perception either good or ill. Theſe perceptions of good and of ill are the primary moral perceptions, with which, as will be ſeen afterward, every other moral perception is intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected.</p>
                  <p>In an attempt to inveſtigate the true foundation of morality, an effect or event, being the end for which we act, preſents itſelf firſt to the mind as its capital object: an action is only a mean employ'd to produce ſome effect or event, and means are always ſubordinate to the end. For this reaſon, I thought it neceſſary to vary from other writers upon moral philoſophy, who begin with actions as the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal object, without giving due attention to the ends for which we act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>ill,</hi> like agreeable and diſagreeable, bitter and ſweet, hard and ſoft, are ſimple qualities, incapable of a definition; and, like theſe, and all other qualities, are objects of perception, independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of conſequences, and independent of reaſoning or reflection. I illuſtrate this doctrine by the following examples: We require no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove, that children of the poor bred to uſeful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by means of a charitable endowment, an infant reſcued from the jaws of a lion, a ſick perſon reſtored to health, the hungry fed, and the naked cloathed, are good effects; they are perceived to be ſuch intuitively: an argument is as little neceſſary to prove, that an old man abandoned to poverty by his favourite ſon in opulent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, a virtuous young woman corrupted by artifice, are ill effects; and that breach of engagement, and harm done to one who dreads no harm from us, are equally ſo: theſe effects are perceived intuitively to be ill.</p>
                  <p>Next as to actions conſidered as means productive of effects. To the qualities of good and ill in effects, correſpond the qualities of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> in actions: An agreeable effect produced intentional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is perceived to be good; and the action by which it is produced, is perceived to be right: a diſagreeable effect produced intentionally
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0743600300:14"/>
is perceived to be ill; and the action by which it is produced, is perceived to be wrong <note n="a" place="bottom">The ſenſe we have that an action is right when intended to produce a good effect, and wrong when intended to produce an ill effect, may ſeem to be the reſult of reaſoning, not merely of perception. But it is not ſo in reality: for though by the power of abſtraction an action may be conſidered ſingly, without joining it either to its cauſe, or to its effect; yet when we do not abſtract, we conſider it in its natural appearance as connected with both; and in this view we perceive, at the firſt glance, without reaſoning, an action connected by intention with a good effect to be right, and an action connected by intention with an ill effect to be wrong.</note>. And as it will be ſeen afterward, that ſome effects are perceived to be ill without being intended; it will alſo be ſeen, that the actions by which ſuch effects are produced, are perceived to be wrong.</p>
                  <p>An action is perceived to be right or wrong according to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect intended, whether the effect follow or not. Thus, if to ſave my friend from being drowned, I plunge into a river, the action is right though I come too late: and if I aim a ſtroke at a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his back, the action is wrong though I happen not to touch him.</p>
                  <p>It holds in actions as in effects: good effects are a ſpecies of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable effects, and right actions a ſpecies of agreeable actions: ill effects are a ſpecies of diſagreeable effects, and wrong actions a ſpecies of diſagreeable actions.</p>
                  <p>Thus, right and wrong, like good and ill, and all other qualities, are objects of perception or intuition; and ſuppoſing them hid from our perception, an attempt to diſcover them by reaſoning would be abſurd; not leſs ſo, than ſuch an attempt with reſpect to beauty or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or with reſpect to the external objects to which theſe qualities belong.</p>
                  <p>For the ſake of perſpicuity, the foregoing obſervations are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſimpleſt caſe, that of an effect or event produced inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally. When we afterward deſcend to particulars, there will be occaſion to ſhow, firſt, That if in acting we foreſee the probability of a diſagreeable effect, though without intending it, the effect in that caſe is perceived to be ill, and the action to be wrong; but not in ſuch a degree as when intended: and, next, That if the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effect, though not foreſeen, might have been foreſeen, it is alſo perceived to be ill, and the action wrong, though in a ſtill lower degree.</p>
                  <p>As inſtinctive actions are cauſed by blind inſtinct, without the leaſt view to conſequences, they are not perceived to be right or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0743600300:15"/>
wrong, but indifferent: and the effects produced by them may be agreeable or diſagreeable; but they are not perceived to be good or ill; they are alſo indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Right actions are diſtinguiſhable into two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> what <hi>ought</hi> to be done, and what <hi>may</hi> be done or left undone. Wrong actions are all of one ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> what ought not to be done. Right actions that may be done or left undone, are, from our very conception of them, a matter of choice: they are right when done; but it is not a wrong to leave them undone. Thus, to remit a juſt debt for the ſake of a growing family; to yield a ſubject in controverſy, rather than go to law with a neighbour; generouſly to return good for ill, are right actions, univerſally approved: yet every man is ſenſible, that ſuch actions are left to his free will, and that he is not bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any of them.</p>
                  <p>Actions that <hi>ought</hi> to be done, as well as actions that <hi>ought not</hi> to be done, merit peculiar attention; becauſe they give occaſion to the moral terms <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obligation;</hi> which come next in order. To ſay that an action ought to be done, means that we have no liberty nor choice, but are neceſſarily tied or obliged to perform: and to ſay that an action ought not to be done, means that we are neceſſarily reſtrained from doing it. Though this neceſſity be moral only, not phyſical; yet we conceive ourſelves deprived by it of liberty and choice, and bound to act, or to forbear acting, in oppoſition to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other motive. The neceſſity here deſcribed is termed <hi>duty:</hi> the abſtaining from harming the innocent is a proper example; which the moral ſenſe makes an indiſpenſable duty, without leaving a ſingle article of it to our own free will.</p>
                  <p>If I be bound in duty to perform or to forbear any particular action, there muſt be a <hi>title</hi> or <hi>right</hi> in ſome perſon to exact that duty from me; and accordingly a <hi>duty</hi> or <hi>obligation</hi> neceſſarily implies a <hi>title</hi> or <hi>right.</hi> Thus, the duty of abſtaining from miſchief implies a right in others to be ſecured againſt miſchief: the man who does an injury, perceives that he has done wrong by violating the right of the perſon injured; and that perſon hath a perception of ſuffering wrong by having his right violated.</p>
                  <p>Our duty is two-fold; duty to others, and duty to ourſelves. With reſpect to others, an action that we ought to do is termed <hi>juſt;</hi> an action that we ought not to do is termed <hi>unjuſt;</hi> and the omiſſion of what we ought to do is alſo termed <hi>unjuſt.</hi> With reſpect to ourſelves, an action that we ought to do is termed <hi>proper;</hi> and an action that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0743600300:16"/>
we ought not to do, as well as the omiſſion of what we ought to do, are termed <hi>improper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>right,</hi> ſignifying a quality of certain actions, is a genus, of which <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> are ſpecies: and <hi>wrong,</hi> ſignifying a quality of other actions, is a genus, of which <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>improper</hi> are ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſe by which we perceive the qualities of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>ill</hi> in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> in actions, and the other moral qualities mentioned and to be mentioned, is termed the MORAL SENSE or CONSCIENCE <note n="a" place="bottom">Every perception, being an act of the mind, muſt proceed from ſome faculty or power of perception, termed <hi>ſenſe.</hi> Whether the moral ſenſe, by which we perceive a right and a wrong in actions, and a good and an ill in effects, be a ſenſe diſtinct from all others, or whether it make a branch of the ſenſe by which we perceive the actions themſelves, and their effects, appears an arbitrary queſtion: the ſenſes by which objects are perceived, are not ſeparated from each other by diſtinct boundaries; and the ſorting or claſſing them, ſeems to depend more on taſte and fancy than on nature. For this reaſon, I have followed the plan laid down by former writers; which is, to conſider the moral ſenſe as a ſenſe diſtinct from others, becauſe it is the eaſieſt and cleareſt manner of conceiving it.</note>.</p>
                  <p>There is no cauſe for doubting the exiſtence of the moral ſenſe, more than for doubting the exiſtence of the ſenſe of beauty, of the ſenſe of ſeeing, of hearing, or of any other ſenſe. In fact, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of right and wrong as qualities of actions, is not leſs diſtinct and clear than that of beauty, of colour, or of any other quality; and as every perception is an act of ſenſe, the ſenſe of beauty is not with greater certainty evinced from the perception of beauty, than the moral ſenſe is from the perception of right and wrong.</p>
                  <p>This is the corner-ſtone of morality: for, abſtracting from the moral ſenſe, the qualities of good and ill in effects, and of right and wrong in actions, would be altogether inexplicable. We find this ſenſe diſtributed among individuals in different degrees of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but there perhaps never exiſted any one above the condition of an idiot, who poſſeſſed it not in ſome degree; and were any man entirely deſtitute of it, the terms <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> would to him be not leſs unintelligible than the term <hi>colour</hi> is to one born blind.</p>
                  <p>That every individual is endued with a ſenſe of right and wrong, more or leſs diſtinct, will readily be granted; but whether there be among men what may be termed a COMMON SENSE of right and wrong, producing uniformity of opinion as to what actions are right and what wrong, is not ſo evident. There appears nothing abſurd in ſuppoſing the opinions of men about right and wrong to be as various as their faces; and the hiſtory of mankind leads us to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that this ſuppoſition is not deſtitute of foundation. For from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0743600300:17"/>
that hiſtory it appears, that among different nations, and even in the ſame nation at different periods, the opinions publicly eſpouſed with regard to right and wrong are extremely various; that among ſome nations it was held lawful for a man to ſell his children as ſlaves, and in their infancy to abandon them to wild beaſts; that it was held equally lawful to puniſh children, even capitally, for the crime of their parent; that the murdering an enemy in cold blood, was once a common practice; that human ſacrifices, impious not leſs than immoral according to our notions, were of old univerſal; that even in later times, it has been held meritorious to inflict cruel torments for the ſlighteſt deviations from the religious creed of the plurality; and that among the moſt enlightened nations, there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable differences with reſpect to the rules of morality.</p>
                  <p>Theſe facts, however well founded, tend not to diſprove the reality of a common ſenſe as to morals: they only evince, that the moral ſenſe has not been equally perfect at all times, and in all countries: which is not ſurpriſing, being the caſe of all our more refined ſenſes and faculties; witneſs, in particular, the ſenſe of beauty, of elegance, of propriety. And with regard to this point, the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may give ſatisfaction. In the order of Providence, the progreſs of our ſpecies toward perfection reſembles that of an individual: we may obſerve an infancy in both; and in both a gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs toward maturity: nor is the reſemblance the leſs perfect, that certain tribes, like certain individuals, ripen faſter than others. The ſavage ſtate is the infancy of man; during which the more delicate ſenſes lie dormant, abandoning nations to the authority of cuſtom, of imitation, and of paſſion, without any juſt taſte of morals more than of the fine arts. But nations, like individuals, ripen gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and acquire in time a refined taſte in morals, as well as in the fine arts; after which we find great uniformity of opinion about the rules of right and wrong, with few exceptions but what may proceed from imbecillity, or corrupted education. There may be found, it is true, even in the moſt enlightened ages, ſome men who have ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notions upon ſome points of morality; and there may be found the like ſingularity upon many other ſubjects: which affords no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt a common ſenſe or ſtandard of right and wrong, more than a monſter doth againſt the ſtandard that regulates our external form, nor more than an exception doth againſt the truth of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propoſition.</p>
                  <p>That there is in mankind a common ſenſe of what is right and wrong, and an uniformity of opinion, is a matter of fact, of which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0743600300:18"/>
the only infallible proof is obſervation and experience: and to that proof I appeal; entering only one caveat, That, for the reaſon above given, the inquiry be confined to nations of poliſhed manners. In the mean time I take the liberty to ſuggeſt an argument from ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, That if there be great uniformity among the different tribes of men in ſeeing and hearing, in truth and falſehood, in pleaſure and pain, &amp;c. what cauſe can we have for ſuſpecting that right and wrong are an exception from the general rule? Whatever minute differences there may be to diſtinguiſh one perſon from another; yet in the general principles that conſtitute our nature, internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, there is wonderful uniformity.</p>
                  <p>That man is by nature a ſocial being, is evident from many of his principles and faculties, calculated chiefly or ſolely to qualify him for the ſocial ſtate. This is eminently the caſe of the moral ſenſe; the very purpoſe of which is, to regulate our conduct in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. That the uniformity of this ſenſe among the different tribes of men, intitling it to be termed <hi>the common ſenſe of mankind,</hi> muſt be calculated for the further improvement of ſociety, is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; and yet does not appear altogether ſo clear at firſt view. For may it not be urged, that we are bound notwithſtanding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our conduct by our own ſenſe or private conviction; and that to act otherwiſe would be to act againſt conſcience? This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is at leaſt plauſible; and if it hold true, ſociety, it muſt be yielded, cannot be benefited by a ſtandard that is not calculated to regulate any branch of our conduct. But the Almighty leaves no imperfection in his works: he intended man for ſociety; he endued him with a ſenſe of right and wrong; he made the perceptions of that ſenſe uniform in all men; and to complete us for ſociety, he has moulded our nature ſo admirably, as that even the man who has the moſt correct ſenſe of morals, is not better qualified for ſociety, than they are who deviate the fartheſt from it. The contrivance, ſimple and beautiful, is, to bind us by a law in our nature to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our conduct by the common ſenſe of mankind, even in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what otherwiſe would be our own ſenſe or private conviction. And that this truly is the ſyſtem of nature, I endeavour to make out as follows.</p>
                  <p>We have an innate ſenſe or conviction of a common nature, not only in our own ſpecies, but in every ſpecies of animals: and our conviction is verified by experience; for there appears a remarkable uniformity among creatures of the ſame kind, and a diſſormity, not leſs remarkable, among creatures of different kinds. This common
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0743600300:19"/>
nature is conceived to be a model or ſtandard for each individual of the kind. Hence it is a matter of wonder, to find an individual deviating from the common nature of the ſpecies, whether in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or external ſtructure: a child born with averſion to its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's milk, is a wonder, not leſs than if born without a mouth, or with more than one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, With reſpect to the common nature of man in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, we have an innate conviction, that it is invariable not leſs than univerſal; that it will be the ſame hereafter as at preſent, and as it was in time paſt; the ſame among all nations, and in all corners of the earth. Nor are we deceived; becauſe giving allowance for the difference of culture, and gradual refinement of manners, the fact cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds to our conviction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have an innate conviction, that this common nature or ſtandard is PERFECT and RIGHT; and that every individual OUGHT to be framed according to it. Every remarkable devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſtandard, makes an impreſſion upon us of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, irregularity, or diſorder; and raiſes a painful emotion: mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous births, exciting the curioſity of a philoſopher, fail not at the ſame time to excite averſion in a high degree.</p>
                  <p>This conviction of perfection in the common nature of man, reaches every branch of his nature; and particularly his ſenſe of the morality and immorality of actions, termed the <hi>moral ſenſe.</hi> This ſenſe accordingly, conſidered as a branch of the common nature of man, is admitted by all to be perfect; and, conſequently, to be the ultimate and unerring ſtandard of morals; to which all are bound to ſubmit, even in oppoſition to their own private ſenſe of right and wrong. At the ſame time, as this ſtandard, through infirmity or prejudice, is not conſpicuous to every individual, we find inſtances, not few in number, of perſons deluded into erroneous moral opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, by miſtaking a falſe ſtandard for that of nature. And hence, with reſpect to individuals, a diſtinction between a right and a wrong ſenſe in morals; a diſtinction which, from the conviction of a moral ſtandard, is obvious to the meaneſt capacity; but of which diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we could not otherwiſe have the ſlighteſt conception.</p>
                  <p>The final cauſe of this branch of our conſtitution is illuſtrious. Were there no ſtandard of right and wrong for determining our end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs controverſies about matters of intereſt, the ſtrong would have recourſe to open violence; the weak to cunning, deceit, and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and ſociety would be altogether intolerable. Courts of law could afford no reſource: for without a ſtandard of morals, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0743600300:20"/>
muſt be arbitrary, and conſequently have no authority nor influence.</p>
                  <p>Happy it is for men, that in all their diſputes about right and wrong, they have this ſtandard to appeal to: it is neceſſary, that in ſociety the actions of individuals be uniform with reſpect to right and wrong; and in order to uniformity of action, it is neceſſary that their perceptions of right and wrong be uniform: to produce ſuch u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity, a ſtandard of morals is indiſpenſable; which is daily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by judges with great ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>To complete this theory, it muſt be added, that, independent of the author's opinion, it is the goodneſs or illneſs of the effect intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which qualifies an action to be right or wrong. Thus, when a man impelled by friendſhip or pity, reſcues from the flames one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be burnt for hereſy, the action is right, even though the man, convinced that heretics ought to be deſtroy'd, be of opinion that the action is wrong.</p>
                  <p>But with reſpect to the author of the action, nature leads us to judge of him by a different rule. He is approved, and held to be INNOCENT, when he does what he himſelf thinks right: he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved, and held to be GUILTY, when he does what he himſelf thinks wrong. Thus, to aſſaſſinate an Atheiſt for the ſake of religion, is a wrong action: and yet the enthuſiaſt who commits that wrong may be innocent: and one is guilty who, contrary to conſcience, eats meat in Lent, though the action is not wrong. Upon the whole, an action is perceived to be right or wrong independent of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's own opinion: but he is approved or diſapproved, held to be innocent or guilty, according to his own opinion.</p>
                  <p>We learn from experience, as above, that every right action is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and every wrong action diſagreeable. But the author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us in a different light: he is agreeable when he acts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to conſcience, though the action be wrong; and diſagreeable when he acts againſt conſcience, though the action be right. He is, however, more agreeable, when he does a right action according to conſcience; and more diſagreeable, when he does a wrong action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which light he muſt always appear to himſelf; for when he acts according to conſcience, he muſt think the action right; and when he acts againſt conſcience, he muſt think the action wrong.</p>

                  <p>HAVING thus eſtabliſhed a ſtandard for morals, which lays a ſolid foundation for the ſcience of morality, the regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is, to inveſtigate the laws that are derived from this ſtandard: and theſe laws may be ſhortly defined, <q rend="inline">"Rules of conduct that are declared to be ſuch by the common ſenſe of mankind, which is the moral ſtandard."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we endeavour to inveſtigate the laws of nature, thoſe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly take the lead that concern our duty: and as duty is of two kinds, duty to others, and duty to ourſelves, we begin with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Of the duties we owe to others, ſome tend to action, ſome to reſtraint; and before entering into particulars, it may be proper to preſent them in a general view. There is one duty ſo general as to comprehend all mankind for its object, all at leaſt that are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and that is the duty of forbearing to hurt others, whether externally or internally. A man may be hurt externally in his goods, in his perſon and relations, and in his reputation. Hence the laws, Thou muſt not ſteal, Thou muſt not defraud others, Thou muſt not kill nor wound, Thou muſt not be guilty of defamation.</p>
                  <p>A man may be hurt internally by an action that occaſions to him diſtreſs of mind; and he may be hurt internally by receiving falſe notions of men and things. Therefore in dealing or converſing with others, conſcience dictates that we ought not to treat them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectfully; that we ought not cauſeleſsly to alienate their affections from others, nor the affections of others from them; and, in general, that we ought to forbear whatever may tend to break their peace of mind, or tend to unqualify them for being good men and good ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</p>
                  <p>Our active duties regard particular perſons, ſuch as our relations, our friends, our benefactors, our maſters, our ſervants, &amp;c.; and theſe duties are more or leſs extenſive, in proportion to the degree of connection. We ought to honour and obey our parents; be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to our children, and endeavour to eſtabliſh them in the world with all advantages, internal and external: we ought to be faithful to our friends, grateful to our benefactors, ſubmiſſive to our maſters, and kind to our ſervants: and, according to our ability,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0743600300:22"/>
we ought to relieve the diſtreſſes of each of them. To be obliged to do good to others beyond theſe bounds, muſt depend on poſitive en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement: for, as will appear afterward, univerſal benevolence is a virtue only, not a duty.</p>
                  <p>Being prepared for particulars by this general ſketch, the firſt duty that comes in view, is that which reſtrains us from harming the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; and to it correſponds a right in the innocent to be ſafe from harm. This is the great law preparatory to ſociety; becauſe without it ſociety could never have exiſted. In this duty, the inflexibility of the moral ſenſe is peculiarly remarkable; for it dictates, that we ought to ſubmit to any diſtreſs, even death itſelf, rather than procure our own ſafety by laying violent hands upon an innocent perſon. And we are under the ſame reſtraint with reſpect to the property of another; for robbery and theft are never upon any pretext indulged. It is true, that a man in extreme hunger may lawfully take food where he can find it; and may freely lay hold of his neighbour's horſe, to carry him from an enemy who threatens death. But the reaſon is, that the proprietor's conſent may juſtly be preſumed in ſuch caſes, upon our ſubmitting to make up the loſs: it is the duty of the proprietor, as a fellow-creature, to aſſiſt me in diſtreſs; and I may lawfully take what he ought to offer, and what I reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably preſume he would offer were he preſent. For the ſame reaſon, if in a ſtorm my ſhip be drove among the anchor-ropes of another ſhip, which ropes I am forc'd to cut in order to get free, the act is lawful, provided I be willing to pay the value. This proviſion is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable: for if, on the one hand, my neighbour be bound to aid me in diſtreſs, reaſon and conſcience bind me, on the other, to make up his loſs, as far as in my power <note n="a" place="bottom">This doctrine is founded on the principle of juſtice; and yet there are in the Roman law two paſſages which deny any recompence in ſuch caſes. <q rend="inline">"Item Labeo ſcribit, ſi cum vi ventorum navis impulſa eſſet in ſunes anchorarum alterius, et nautae ſunes praecidiſſent, ſi nullo alio modo, niſi praeciſis ſunibus, explicare ſe potuit, nullam actionem dandam;"</q>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0743600300:23"/>
The prohibition of hurting others internally, is perhaps not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the formation of ſocieties, becauſe the tranſgreſſion of that law doth not much alarm plain people: but among people of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and refined ſentiments, the mind is ſuſceptible of more grievous wounds than the body; and therefore without that law a poliſhed ſociety could have no long endurance.</p>
                  <p>By adultery miſchief is done both external and internal. Each ſex is ſo conſtituted as to require ſtrict fidelity and attachment in their mates; and the breach of this fidelity is the greateſt external miſchief that can befal them. It is alſo a hurt internally, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their peace of mind. It has indeed been urged, That this hurt will be avoided if the adultery be kept ſecret; and therefore that there can be no crime where there is no diſcovery. But they who reaſon thus do not advert, that to declare ſecret adultery to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is in effect to overturn every foundation of mutual truſt and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the married ſtate <note n="a" place="bottom">It is clear beyond all doubt, ſays a reputable writer, that no man is permitted to violate his faith; and that the man is unjuſt and barbarous who deprives his wife of the only reward ſhe has for adhering to the auſtere duties of her ſex. But an unfaithful wife is ſtill more criminal, by diſſolving the whole ties of nature: in giving to her huſband children that are not his, ſhe betrays both, and joins perfidy to infidelity; <hi>Emile, liv.</hi> 5.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Veracity is commonly ranked among the active duties: but erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly; for if a man be not bound to ſpeak, he cannot be bound to ſpeak truth. It is therefore only a reſtraining duty, importing that we ought not to deceive others by affirming what is not true. Among the many correſponding principles in the human mind, a principle of veracity <note n="b" place="bottom">Truth is always uppermoſt, being the natural iſſue of the mind: it requires no art nor training, no inducement nor temptation, but only that we yield to a natural impulſe. Lying, on the contrary, is doing violence to our nature; and is never practiſed, even by the worſt men, without ſome temptation. Speaking truth is like uſing our natural food, which we would do from appetite, although it anſwered no end: lying is like taking phyſic, which is nauſeous to the taſte, and which no man takes but for ſome end which he cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe attain; <hi>Dr Reid's Inquiry into the human mind.</hi>
                     </note>, and a principle that leads us to believe what is ſaid to us, are two: without the latter, the former would be an uſeleſs principle; and without the former, the latter would be a dangerous one, laying us open to fraud and deceit. The moral ſenſe accordingly dictates, that we ought to adhere ſtrictly to truth, without regard to conſequences.</p>
                  <p>From this it muſt not be inferred, that we are bound to explain our thoughts when the truth is demanded from us by unlawful force. Words uttered voluntarily are naturally relied on as expreſſing the ſpeaker's mind; and if he falſify their meaning, he tells a lie,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0743600300:24"/>
and is guilty of deceit. But words drawn from a man by unlawful force, are no evidence of his mind; and therefore, to ſave his life in ſuch circumſtances, it is no infringement of duty to utter whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver words may be agreeable, however alien from his thoughts: there is no reaſon to preſume, in this caſe, any correſpondence between his words and his mind; and if the author of the unlawful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſuffer himſelf to be deceived, he muſt blame himſelf, not the ſpeaker.</p>
                  <p>It need ſcarce be mentioned, that the duty of veracity excludes not fable, nor any liberty of ſpeech intended for amuſement, and not to be a voucher of truth.</p>
                  <p>The firſt active duty I ſhall mention in particular, is that which ſubſiſts between parents and children. The relation of parent and child, being one of the ſtrongeſt that can exiſt among individuals, makes mutual benevolence between theſe perſons an indiſpenſable duty. Benevolence among other blood-relations is alſo a duty; though inferior in degree, for it wears away gradually as the relation becomes more diſtant.</p>
                  <p>Gratitude is a duty directed to a particular object; and the object of gratitude is one whoſe kindneſs and good offices require ſuitable returns. But though gratitude is ſtrictly a duty, the meaſure of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and the kind, are left moſtly to our own choice. It is ſcarce neceſſary to add, that the active duties now mentioned are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all to be abſolutely inflexible; perhaps more ſo than the reſtraining duties: many find excuſes for doing harm; but no one hears with patience an excuſe for deviating from friendſhip or gratitude.</p>
                  <p>Diſtreſs tends vigorouſly to convert the virtue of benevolence into a duty. But diſtreſs alone is not ſufficient, without other concurring circumſtances; for to relieve the diſtreſſed in general, would be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty far beyond the reach of the moſt powerful prince that ever exiſted. Our relations in diſtreſs claim this duty from us, and even our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but diſtant diſtreſs, where there is no particular connection, ſcarce rouſes our ſympathy, and never is an object of duty. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther connections, too numerous for this ſhort eſſay, extend the duty of relieving others from diſtreſs; and theſe naturally make a large branch in every treatiſe upon equity.</p>
                  <p>One great advantage of ſociety is, the co-operation of many to accompliſh ſome uſeful end, for which a ſingle hand would be inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. All the arts, manufactures, and commercial dealings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire many hands, which cannot be depended on if there be no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0743600300:25"/>
and therefore the performance of promiſes and covenants is in ſociety a capital <hi>duty.</hi> In their original occupations of hunting and fiſhing, men, living ſcattered and diſperſed, had ſeldom oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to aid and benefit each other; and in that ſituation covenants, being of little uſe, were little regarded. But huſbandry, being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to population, and requiring the co-operation of many hands, drew men together for mutual aſſiſtance; and then covenants began to make a figure: arts and commerce made them more and more neceſſary; and by the improvement of man's nature in ſociety, the utmoſt regard at preſent is had to them.</p>
                  <p>But contracts and promiſes are not confined to commercial deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: they ſerve alſo to make benevolence a duty, independent of any pecuniary intereſt. They are even extended ſo far, as to connect the living with the dead. A man would die with regret, if he thought his friends were not bound by the promiſes they make to fulfil his will after his death: and to quiet the minds of men with reſpect to futurity, the moral ſenſe makes the performing ſuch promiſes our duty. Thus, if I promiſe to my friend to erect a monument for him after his death, conſcience binds me, even though no perſon alive be intitled to demand performance: every one holds this to be my duty; and I muſt lay my account to ſuffer reproach and blame, if I neglect my engagement.</p>
                  <p>To fulfil a rational promiſe or covenant deliberately made, is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not leſs inflexible than thoſe duties are which ariſe independent of conſent. But as man is fallible, liable to fraud and impoſition, and to be miſled by ignorance or error, his caſe would be deplorable, were he compelled by the moral ſenſe to fulfil every engagement, however imprudent or irrational. Here the moral ſenſe, bending to circumſtances, is accommodated to the fallible nature of man: it relieves him from deceit, from impoſition, from ignorance, and from error; and binds him to no engagement but what fairly anſwers the end propoſed by it.</p>
                  <p>The other branch of duties, comprehending thoſe we owe to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may be diſcuſſed in a few words. The ſenſe of propriety, a branch of the moral ſenſe, regulates our conduct with reſpect to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as the ſenſe of juſtice, another branch of the moral ſenſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates our conduct with reſpect to others. The ſenſe of propriety dictates, that we ought to act ſuitably to the dignity of our nature, and to the ſtation allotted us by Providence; and, in particular, that temperance, prudence, modeſty, and regularity of conduct, are ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duties. Theſe duties contribute greatly to private happineſs, by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0743600300:26"/>
preſerving health, peace of mind, and a juſtly founded ſelf-eſteem; which are great bleſſings: they contribute not leſs to happineſs in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, by procuring love and eſteem, and conſequently aid and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in time of need.</p>
                  <p>Upon reviewing the foregoing duties reſpecting others, we find them more or leſs extenſive; but none of them ſo extenſive as to have for their object the good of mankind in general. The moſt extenſive duty is that of reſtraint, prohibiting us to harm others: but even this duty ſuffers an exception reſpecting thoſe who merit puniſhment. The active duties of doing good are circumſcribed within much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower bounds; requiring an intimate relation for their object, ſuch as what we bear to our parents, our children, our friends, our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors. The ſlighter relations are not an object, unleſs with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of peculiar circumſtances: neighbourhood, for example, does not alone make benevolence a duty; but ſuppoſing a neighbour to be in diſtreſs, we become bound to relieve him in proportion to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. For it is remarkable in human nature, that though we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſympathiſe with our relations, and with thoſe under our eye, the diſtreſs of perſons remote and unknown affects us very little. Pactions and agreements become neceſſary, where the purpoſe is to extend the duty of benevolence, in any particular, beyond the bounds mentioned. Men, it is true, are ſometimes capable of doing more good than is preſcribed to them as a duty; but every ſuch good muſt be voluntary.</p>
                  <p>And this leads to moral acts that are left to our own will to be done or left undone; which is the ſecond general branch of moral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions mentioned above. Writers differ ſtrangely about the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of man. Some hold him to be merely a ſelfiſh being, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any motive to action but what ultimately reſpects himſelf: this is too bold an aſſertion, being contradictory to the experience of all ages, which affords the cleareſt conviction, that men frequently act for the good of others, without regard to their own good, and ſometimes in direct oppoſition to it. Other writers, running to the oppoſite extreme, advance benevolence to be a duty, maintaining that every one of the human race is intitled to all the good we can poſſibly do them: which baniſhes every conſideration of ſelf-intereſt, other than what we owe to ourſelves as a part of the general ſociety of men. This doctrine is not leſs contradictory to experience than the former: for we find that men generally are diſpoſed to prefer their own intereſt before that of thoſe with whom they have no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0743600300:27"/>
connection: nor do we find ſuch bias controlled by the moral ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the actions that belong to the preſent branch, the moral ſenſe impoſes no laws upon us, leaving us at freedom to act or not according to our own inclination. Taking, accordingly, under conſideration any ſingle benevolent act by itſelf, it is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when done, but not condemned when left undone. But conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the whole of our conduct, the moral ſenſe appears to vary a little. As the nature of man is complex, partly ſocial, partly ſelfiſh, reaſon dictates that our conduct ought to be conformable to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that, in advancing our own intereſt, we ought not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to neglect that of others. The man accordingly who confines his whole time and thoughts within his own little ſphere, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by all the world as guilty of wrong conduct; and the man himſelf, if his moral perceptions be not blunted by ſelfiſhneſs, muſt be ſenſible that he deſerves to be condemned. On the other hand, it is poſſible that voluntary benevolence may be extended beyond proper bounds. The true balance of the mind conſiſts in a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of benevolence to ſelf-love; and therefore, where that balance is ſo varied as to give ſuperior weight to the former, a man thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted will be exceſſive in his benevolence: he will ſacrifice a great intereſt of his own to a ſmall intereſt of others; and the moral ſenſe dictates that ſuch conduct is wrong.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the ſubject of this chapter in general, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to preſume from the uniformity of our moral perceptions, that there muſt be ſome general character diſtinguiſhing right actions, and their good effects, from wrong actions, and their ill effects. And from the deduction above given it will appear, that the general tendency of the former is, to promote the good of ſociety; and of the latter, to obſtruct that good. Univerſal benevolence, as a duty, is indeed not required of man; for an evident reaſon, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is beyond the reach of his utmoſt abilities: but for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the general good, every duty is required of him that he can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh; which will appear from the ſlighteſt review of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties. The prohibition of harming others is an eaſy taſk, and therefore is made univerſal. Our active duties are in a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent condition: man is circumſcribed both in his capacity and powers; he cannot do good but in a ſlow ſucceſſion; and therefore it is wiſely ordered, that the obligation he is under to do good ſhould be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his relations, his friends, his benefactors. Even diſtreſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make benevolence a general duty: all a man can readily do, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0743600300:28"/>
all he is bound to do, is to relieve thoſe at hand; and accordingly we hear of diſtant misfortunes with very little or no concern.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, let us not miſapprehend the moral ſyſtem, as if it were our duty, or even lawful, to proſecute what, upon the whole, we reckon the moſt beneficial to ſociety, balancing ill with good. In the moral ſyſtem, it is not permitted to violate the moſt trivial right of any one, however beneficial it may be to others. For example, a man in low circumſtances, by denying a debt he owes to a rich miſer, ſaves himſelf and a hopeful family from ruin. In this caſe the good effect far outweighs the ill: but the moral ſenſe admits no balancing between good and ill, and gives no quarter to injuſtice, whatever benefit it may produce. And hence a maxim in which all moraliſts agree, That we muſt not do evil even to bring about good. This doctrine, at the ſame time, is nicely correſpondent to the nature of man: were it a rule in ſociety, That a greater benefit to others would make it juſt to deprive me of my life, of my reputation, or of my effects, I ſhould follow the advice of a celebrated philoſopher, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſociety, and take refuge among the ſavages.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Principles of Duty and of Benevolence.</head>
                  <p>HAVING thus ſhortly delineated the laws of nature, we proceed to a very important article; which is, to inquire into the means provided by the author of our nature for compelling obedience to theſe laws. The moral ſenſe is an excellent guide; but the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert guide will avail nothing to thoſe who are not diſpoſed to follow him. Intuitive knowledge of what is right, cannot of itſelf be a motive to act righteouſly, more than intuitive knowledge of what is wrong can be a motive to act unrighteouſly. From this ſingle conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, it muſt be evident, that, to complete the moral ſyſtem, there ought to be ſome principle or propenſity in our nature, ſome impelling power, to be a motive for acting when the moral ſenſe ſays we ought to act, and to reſtrain us from acting when the moral ſenſe ſays we ought not to act.</p>
                  <p>The author of our nature leaves none of his works imperfect. In order to render us obſequious to the moral ſenſe, as our guide, he hath implanted in our nature the three great principles, of duty, of voluntary benevolence, and of rewards and puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0743600300:29"/>
It may poſſibly be thought that rewards and puniſhments, of which afterward, are ſufficient of themſelves to inforce the laws of our nature, without neceſſity of any other principle. Human laws, it is true, are inforc'd by theſe means, becauſe no higher ſanction is under the command of a terreſtrial legiſlator: but the celeſtial le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, with power that knows no control, and benevolence that knows no limits, has inforc'd his laws by means not leſs remarkable for their mildneſs than for their efficacy: he employs no external compulſion; but in order to engage our will on the ſide of moral conduct, has in the breaſt of every individual eſtabliſhed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mentioned, which efficaciouſly excite us to obey the dictates of the moral ſenſe. Other principles may ſolicit and allure; but the principle of duty aſſumes authority, commands, and muſt be obey'd.</p>
                  <p>As one great advantage of ſociety is, the furniſhing opportunities without end of mutual aid and aſſiſtance, beyond what is ſtrictly our duty; nature hath diſpoſed us to do good by the principle of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, which is a powerful incitement to be kindly, beneficent, and generous. Nor is this principle, as will afterward appear, too ſparingly diſtributed: its ſtrength is ſo nicely proportioned to our ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in this world, as better to anſwer its deſtination, than if it were an over-match for ſelf-intereſt, and for every other principle.</p>
                  <p>Thus, moral actions are divided into two claſſes: the firſt regards our duty, containing actions that ought to be done, and actions that ought not to be done: the other regards actions left to ourſelves, containing actions that are right when done, but not wrong when left undone. It will appear afterward, that the well-being of ſociety depends more on the firſt claſs than on the ſecond; that ſociety is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed promoted by the latter; but that it can ſcarce ſubſiſt unleſs the former be made our duty. Hence it is, that actions only of the firſt claſs are made indiſpenſable, actions of the ſecond claſs being left to our own free will. And hence alſo it is, that the various principles or propenſities that diſpoſe us to actions of the firſt ſort, are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of <hi>primary virtues,</hi> giving the name of <hi>ſecondary virtues</hi> to thoſe principles or propenſities which diſpoſe us to actions of the other ſort <note n="a" place="bottom">Virtue in general ſignifies that diſpoſition of mind which gives the aſcendant to moral principles. Vice in general ſignifies that diſpoſition of mind which gives little or no aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to moral principles.</note>.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Rewards and Puniſhments.</head>
                  <p>REFLECTING upon the moral branch of our nature qualifying us for ſociety in the moſt perfect manner, we cannot overlook the hand of our maker; for means ſo finely prepared to accompliſh an important end, never happen by chance. At the ſame time it muſt be acknowledged, that in many men the principle of duty has not vigour nor authority ſufficient to ſtem every tide of unruly paſſion: by the vigilance of ſome paſſions we are taken unprepared, deluded by the ſly inſinuations of others, or overwhelmed with the ſtormy impetuoſity of a third ſort. Moral evil thus gains ground, and much wrong is done. This new ſcene makes it evident, that there muſt be ſome article wanting to complete the preſent undertaking. The means provided for directing us in the road of duty are indeed explained; but as in deviating from the road wrongs are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is hitherto nothing ſaid of redreſſing theſe wrongs, nor of preventing the reiteration of them. To accompliſh theſe valuable ends, there are added to the moral ſyſtem the principle of rewards and puniſhments, and that of reparation; of which in their order.</p>
                  <p>Such animals as are governed entirely by inſtinct, may be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for ſociety; which, among quadrupeds, is the caſe of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and, among winged animals, of the bees, of the crows, and of ſome other kinds. But very few of the human actions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive: they are generally prompted by paſſions, of which there is an endleſs variety, ſocial and ſelfiſh, benevolent and malevolent: and were every paſſion equally intitled to gratification, man would be utterly incapable of ſociety; he would be a ſhip without a rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, obedient to every wind, and moving at random, without any deſtination. The faculty of reaſon would make no oppoſition; for were there no ſenſe of wrong, it would be reaſonable to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy every deſire that harms not ourſelves: and to talk of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment would be abſurd; for the very idea of puniſhment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies ſome wrong that ought to be repreſſed. Hence the neceſſity of the moral ſenſe to qualify us for ſociety, and to make us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable beings: by teaching us what is our duty, it renders us accountable for our actions, and makes us fit objects of rewards and puniſhments. The moral ſenſe fulfils another valuable purpoſe: it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0743600300:31"/>
forms in our minds an unerring ſtandard, directing the application and the meaſure of rewards and puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>But to complete the ſyſtem of rewards and puniſhments, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that not only power, but alſo inclination, be conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one, or upon many, to reward and to puniſh. The author of our nature has provided amply for the firſt, by intitling every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual to exerciſe that power as his native privilege. And he has equally provided for the other, by a noted principle implanted in our nature, prompting us to reward the virtuous, and to puniſh the vicious. Every act of duty is rewarded with our approbation: a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent act is rewarded with our eſteem: a generous act commands our affection. Theſe, and other virtuous actions, have a ſtill higher reward; which is, the conſciouſneſs of merit in the author himſelf.</p>
                  <p>As to puniſhment, it would be inconſiſtent to puniſh any defect in benevolence, conſidered as a virtue left to our own free will. But an action done intentionally to produce miſchief is criminal, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits puniſhment: ſuch an action being diſagreeable, raiſes my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even though I have no connection with the perſon injured; and being impelled, by the principle under conſideration, to puniſh vice, as well as to reward virtue, I muſt chaſtiſe the delinquent by indignation, at leaſt, and hatred. An injury done to myſelf raiſes my reſentment to a higher pitch: I am not ſatisfied with ſo ſlight a puniſhment as indignation or hatred; the author muſt by my hand ſuffer miſchief as great as he has done me.</p>
                  <p>Even the moſt ſecret crime eſcapes not puniſhment; for, though hid from others, it cannot be hid from the delinquent himſelf. It raiſes in him the painful paſſion of remorſe: this paſſion, in its ſtronger fits, makes him wiſh to be puniſhed; and, in extreme, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently impels him to be his own executioner. There cannot be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined a contrivance more effectual to deter us from vice; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe is itſelf a ſevere puniſhment. But this is not the whole of ſelf-puniſhment: every criminal, ſenſible that he ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, dreads puniſhment from others; and this painful feeling, however ſmothered during proſperity, becomes extremely ſevere in adverſity, or in any depreſſion of mind. Then it is that his crime ſtares him in the face, and that every accidental misfortune is, in his diſturbed imagination, converted into a real puniſhment: <q rend="inline">"And they ſaid one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us; and we would not hear: therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us. And Reuben anſwered them, ſaying, Spake I not unto you, ſaying,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0743600300:32"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>No tranſgreſſion of the duty we owe to ourſelves eſcapes puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more than the tranſgreſſion of the duty we owe to others. The puniſhments, though not the ſame, are nearly allied; and differ in degree more than in kind. Injuſtice is puniſhed by the delinquent himſelf with remorſe; impropriety with ſhame, which is remorſe in a lower degree. Injuſtice raiſes indignation in the beholder, and ſo doth every flagrant impropriety: ſlighter improprieties receive a milder puniſhment, being rebuked with ſome degree of contempt, and frequently with deriſion.</p>
                  <p>So far have we been carried in a beaten track: but in attempting to proceed, we are intangled in ſeveral intricacies and obſtructions. Doth an action well intended, though it fall ſhort of its aim, intitle the author to a reward; or an action ill-intended, though it happen to produce no miſchief, ſubject him to puniſhment? The moral ſenſe, in ſome individuals, is known to be ſo perverted, as to differ, perhaps widely, from the common ſenſe of mankind; muſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or the latter be the rule for puniſhing or rewarding ſuch perſons? At firſt there will be little heſitation in affirming, that the common ſenſe of mankind muſt be the ſtandard for rewards and puniſhments, as well as for civil claims: but theſe queſtions ſuggeſt ſome doubts, which, after due examination, lead to an important diſcovery, That rewards and puniſhments are regulated by a different ſtandard.</p>
                  <p>It is the common ſenſe of mankind that determines actions to be right or wrong, juſt or unjuſt, proper or improper. By this ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, all pecuniary claims are judged, all claims of property, and, in a word, every demand founded upon intereſt; not excepting repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as will afterward appear. But with reſpect to the moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of men, and with reſpect to rewards and puniſhments, a ſtandard is eſtabliſhed far leſs rigid; which is, the opinion that men form of their own actions: and accordingly, as mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, a man is held to be innocent when he does what he himſelf thinks right; and is held to be guilty when he does what he himſelf thinks wrong. Thus we are led, by a natural principle, to judge of others as we believe they judge of themſelves; and by that rule we pronounce them virtuous or vicious, innocent or guilty; and we approve or diſapprove, praiſe or blame them accordingly <note n="a" place="bottom">Virtuous and vicious, innocent and guilty, ſignify qualities both of men and of their actions. Approbation and diſapprobation, praiſe and blame, do not ſignify qualities; but ſignify certain ſeelings or ſentiments of thoſe who ſee or conſider men and their actions.</note>. Some,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0743600300:33"/>
it is true, are ſo perverted by bad education, or by ſuperſtition, as to eſpouſe numberleſs abſurd tenets, flatly contradicting the common ſtandard of right and wrong; and yet even theſe make no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the rule: if they act according to conſcience, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, however wrong the action may be; and if they act againſt conſcience, they are guilty, however right the action may be. Here then is a conſpicuous ſtandard for rewards and puniſhments: it is a man's own conſcience that declares him innocent or guilty, and conſequently fit to be rewarded or puniſhed; for it is abhorrent to every natural perception, that a guilty perſon be rewarded, or an innocent perſon puniſhed. Further, in order that perſonal merit and demerit may not in any meaſure depend upon chance, we are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted as to place innocence and guilt, not on the event, but on the intention of doing right or wrong; and accordingly, whatever be the event, a man will be praiſed for an action well intended, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for an action ill intended.</p>
                  <p>But what if a man intending a wrong, happen by accident to do a wrong he did not intend; as, for example, intending to rob a warren by ſhooting the rabbits, he accidentally wound a child unſeen behind a buſh? The delinquent ought to be puniſhed for intending to rob; and he is alſo ſubjected to repair the hurt done to the child: but he cannot be puniſhed for this accidental wound; becauſe the law of nature regulates puniſhment by the intention, and not by the event <note n="a" place="bottom">During the infancy of nations, pecuniary compoſitions for crimes obtained univerſally; and during that long period very little weight was laid upon intention. This proceeded from the groſſneſs and obſcurity of moral perceptions, joined with the reſemblance of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary puniſhment to reparation: where a man does miſchief intentionally, or is <hi>verſans in illicito,</hi> as expreſſed in the Roman law, he may juſtly be bound to repair all the harm that enſues, however accidentally; and from the reſemblance of pecuniary puniſhment to repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the rule was inadvertently extended to puniſhment. But this rule, ſo groſs, and ſo little confiſtent with moral principles, could not long ſubſiſt after pecuniary compoſitions gave place to corporal puniſhment; and accordingly, among civilized nations, the law of nature was reſtored, which prohibits puniſhment for any miſchief that is not intentional. The Engliſh muſt be excepted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, remarkably tenacious of their original laws and cuſtoms, preſerve in force, even as to capital puniſhment, the above-mentioned rule that obtained when pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary compoſitions were in vigour. The following paſſage is from Hale's Pleas of the crown, <hi>ch.</hi> 39. <q rend="inline">"Regularly he that voluntarily and knowingly intends hurt to the perſon of a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for example to beat him, though he intend not death; yet if death enſues, it excuſeth not from the guilt of murder, or manſlaughter at leaſt, as the circumſtances of the caſe happen."</q> And Foſter, in his Crown-law, though a judicious and accurate writer, lays down the ſame doctrine, without even ſuſpecting in it the leaſt deviation from moral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: <q rend="inline">"A ſhooteth at the poultry of B, and by accident killeth a man; if his intention was to ſteal the poultry, which muſt be collected from circumſtances, it will be murder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reaſon of that felonious intent; but if it was done wantonly, and without that intention, it will be barely manſlaughter;"</q>

The tranſgreſſion of the primary virtues is attended with ſevere and never-failing puniſhments, which are much more effectual than any that have been invented to inforce municipal laws: on the other hand, there is very little merit aſcribed even to the ſtricteſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of them. The ſecondary virtues are directly oppoſite, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their rewards and puniſhments: the neglect of them is not attended with any puniſhment; but the practice of them is attended with the higheſt degree of approbation. Offices of undeſerved kindneſs, returns of good for evil, generous toils and ſufferings for our friends, or for our country, come under this claſs: to perform actions of this kind, there is no motive that, in a proper ſenſe, can be termed a law; but there are the ſtrongeſt motives that can conſiſt with freedom, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance being rewarded with a conſciouſneſs of ſelf-merit, and with univerſal praiſe and admiration, the higheſt rewards human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſuſceptible of.</p>
                  <p>From what is ſaid, the following obſervation will occur: The pain of tranſgreſſing juſtice, fidelity, or any primary virtue, is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the pleaſure of performance; but the pain of neglecting a generous action, or any ſecondary virtue, is as nothing, compared with the pleaſure of performance. Among the vices oppoſite to the primary virtues, the moſt ſtriking moral deformity is found: among the ſecondary virtues, the moſt ſtriking moral beauty.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Reparation.</head>
                  <p>REPARATION, a capital part of the moral ſyſtem, promotes two ends of great importance: it repreſſes wrongs that are not cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; and it alſo makes up the loſs ſuſtained by wrongs of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever kind. With reſpect to the former, reparation is a ſpecies of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and with reſpect to the latter, it is a branch of juſtice. Theſe ends will be better underſtood, after aſcertaining the nature and true foundation of reparation. Every claim for reparation ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a wrong action done by one, and loſs or miſchief thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to another: And hence, 1<hi>mo,</hi> There can be no claim for repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0743600300:35"/>
if the action was innocent, whatever be the miſchief; 2<hi>do,</hi> Nor can there be any claim unleſs miſchief have happened, however wrong, or even criminal, the action may be. That the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be awarded muſt correſpond to the extent of the loſs or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, is ſelf-evident. The ſingle difficulty is, to ſeparate, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe boundaries, actions that are wrong from thoſe that are innocent. In order to explain the qualities of right and wrong, it was ſufficient at firſt to lay down in general, That an action done intentionally to produce an agreeable effect, is right; and done intentionally to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a diſagreeable effect, is wrong. But upon examining this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more narrowly, certain actions are diſcovered to be wrong, though the miſchief they have produced was not intended; and certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are diſcovered to be innocent, though they have produced miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. And theſe I ſhall endeavour to explain, as follows.</p>
                  <p>The moral ſenſe dictates, that in acting we ought carefully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void doing miſchief: the only difficulty is, to determine what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of care is requiſite. An action may produce miſchief that was foreſeen, but not intended; and it may produce miſchief that was neither intended nor foreſeen. The former is not cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; becauſe no action has that character, without an intention to produce miſchief: but it is CULPABLF or FAULTY, becauſe the moral ſenſe prohibits every action that may probably do miſchief; and if we do miſchief by tranſgreſſing that prohibition, we are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by others, and even by ourſelves. Thus, a man who throws a large ſtone into the market-place among a crowd of people, is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly culpable; becauſe he foreſaw that miſchief would probably enſue, though he had no intention to hurt any perſon. With reſpect to the latter, though the miſchief was neither intended nor foreſeen, yet if it <hi>might</hi> have been foreſeen, the action ſo far is raſh or incautious, and conſequently culpable or faulty in ſome degree. Thus, if a man, in pulling down an old houſe adjacent to a frequented place, happen to wound a paſſenger, without calling aloud that people may keep out of the way, the action is in ſome degree culpable, becauſe the miſchief might have been foreſeen. But though harm enſue, an action is not culpable or faulty, if all reaſonable precaution have been adhibited: the moral ſenſe declares the author to be innocent: the effect is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be accidental; and the action may be termed <hi>unlucky</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,</hi> but cannot be ſaid to be either right or wrong <note n="a" place="bottom">Si putator, ex arbore ramum cum dejecerit, vel machinarius, hominem praetereuntem occidit: ita tenetur, ſi is in publicum decidat, nec ille proclamavit, ut caſus ejus evitari poſſet. Quod ſi nullum iter erit, dolum dumtaxat praeſtare debet, ne immittat in eum, quem viderit tranſeuntem: nam culpa ab co exigenda non eſt; cum divinare non potuerit, an per cum locum aliquis tranſiturus ſit; <hi>l.</hi> 31. <hi>ad. leg.

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0743600300:36"/>
With reſpect to raſh or incautious actions, where the miſchief might have been foreſeen, though neither intended nor actually foreſeen, it is not ſufficient to eſcape blame, that a man naturally raſh or inattentive acts according to his character: a degree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution is required of him, both by himſelf and by others, ſuch as is natural to the generality of men. The author, in particular, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, that he might and ought to have acted more cautiouſly; and his conſcience reproaches him for his inattention, not leſs than if he were naturally more cool and attentive. Thus the circumſpection natural to man in general, is applied as a ſtandard to every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual; and if they fall ſhort of that ſtandard, they are culpable and blameable, however unforeſeen by them the miſchief may have been. This rule is diſtinctly laid down in the Roman law: <q rend="inline">"Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam autem eſſe, quod, cum a diligente provideri poterit, non eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet proviſum <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 31. ad. leg. Aquil.</note>."</q> Here the perſon's ordinary diligence is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to as the ſtandard, but the ordinary diligence of mankind. Ariſtotle, in his Rhetoric, has evidently the ſame rule in view: <q rend="inline">"Reaſon teacheth us to diſtinguiſh between an injury and a fault, and between a fault and a mere accident. A mere accident can neither be foreſeen nor prevented: a fault is where the miſchief <hi>might</hi> have been foreſeen, but where the action was done without evil intention: an injury is that which is done with an evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is ſaid upon culpable actions is equally applicable to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable omiſſions; for by theſe alſo miſchief may be occaſioned, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling the ſufferer to reparation. If we forbear to do our duty with an intention to occaſion miſchief, the forbearance is criminal. The only nice point is, how far forbearance without ſuch intention is culpable. If the probability of miſchief was foreſeen, though not intended, the omiſſion is highly culpable; and though neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended nor foreſeen, yet the omiſſion is culpable, in a lower degree, if there have been leſs care and attention than are proper for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the duty required. But ſuppoſing all due care, the omiſſion of extreme care and diligence is not culpable.</p>
                  <p>Upon aſcertaining what acts and omiſſions are culpable or faulty, every intricacy with reſpect to reparation vaniſhes; for it may be laid down as a rule, without an exception, That every culpable act, and every culpable omiſſion, binds us in conſcience to repair the miſchief
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0743600300:37"/>
occaſioned by it. The moral ſenſe binds us no farther; for it loads not with reparation the man who is innocent, though he have done harm: the harm is accidental; and we are ſo conſtituted as not to be reſponſible in conſcience for what happens by accident. But here it is requiſite that the man be in every reſpect innocent; for if he intend harm of any ſort, he will find himſelf bound in conſcience to repair the harm he has done, even accidentally: as, for example, when aiming a blow unjuſtly at one in the dark, he happens to wound another whom he did not ſuſpect to be there. And hence it is a rule in all municipal laws, That one <hi>verſans in illicito</hi> is liable for every conſequence. That theſe particulars are wiſely ordered by the author of our nature for the good of ſociety, will appear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>We are now prepared for a more particular inſpection of the two ends of reparation above mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the repreſſing wrongs that are not criminal, and the making up what loſs is ſuſtained by wrongs of whatever kind. With reſpect to the firſt, it is clear, that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in its proper ſenſe, cannot be inflicted for a wrong that is cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable only; and if nature did not provide ſome means for repreſſing ſuch wrongs, ſociety would ſcarce be a comfortable ſtate: without a pecuniary reparation, there would be no compulſion, other than that of conſcience merely, to prevent culpable omiſſions: and with reſpect to culpable commiſſions, the neceſſity of reparation is ſtill more apparent; for conſcience alone, without the ſanction of reparation, would ſeldom have authority ſufficient to reſtrain us from acting raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or incautiouſly, even where the poſſibility of miſchief is foreſeen, and far leſs where it is not foreſeen.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the ſecond end of reparation, my conſcience dictates to me, that if a man ſuffer by my fault, whether the miſchief was foreſeen or not foreſeen, it is my duty to make up his loſs; and I perceive intuitively, that the loſs ought to reſt ultimately upon me, and not upon the ſufferer, who has done no wrong.</p>
                  <p>In every caſe where the miſchief done can be eſtimated by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary compenſation, the two ends of reparation coincide. The ſum is taken from the one as a ſort of puniſhment for his fault, and is beſtowed on the other to relieve him from the loſs he has ſuſtained. But there are numberleſs inſtances, where the miſchief done admits not an equivalent in money; and in ſuch inſtances, there is no place for reparation except with relation to its firſt end. Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contemptuous treatment, perſonal reſtraint, the breaking one's peace of mind, are injuries that cannot be repaired by money; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0743600300:38"/>
the pecuniary reparation that the wrong-doer is decreed to make, can only be as a ſort of puniſhment, in order to deter him from a reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch injuries: the ſum, it is true, is awarded to the perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured; but this cannot be to make up his loſs, which money cannot do, but only as a <hi>ſolatium</hi> for what he has ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto it is ſuppoſed, that the man who intends an ill effect is at the ſame time conſcious of its being ill. But a man may intend an ill effect, thinking, erroneouſly, that it is good; or a good effect, thinking, erroneouſly, that it is ill: and the queſtion is, What ſhould be the conſequence of ſuch error with reſpect to reparation? The latter caſe is clear: if the effect be good, the action that produced it is right, whatever be the author's opinion; and no perſon who occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally ſuffers loſs by a right action is intitled to complain. On the other hand, if the effect be ill, and the action conſequently wrong, the innocence of the author, for which he is indebted to an error in judgement, will not relieve him from reparation. When he is made ſenſible of his error, he perceives himſelf bound in conſcience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the harm he has done by a wrong action: and all others, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the beginning of his error, perceive that he is ſo bound; for to them it muſt appear obvious, that a man's errors ought ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to affect himſelf only, and not the perſon who has not erred. Hence, in general, reparation always follows wrong or injuſtice; and is not in the leaſt affected by an erroneous opinion of a right action being wrong, or a wrong action right.</p>
                  <p>But this doctrine ſuffers an exception with reſpect to a man who, having undertaken a truſt, is bound in duty to act: as where an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the revenue, upon a doubtful clauſe in a ſtatute, makes a ſei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zure of goods, as forfeited to the crown, which afterward in the proper court are found not to be ſeizable. The officer, in this caſe, ought not to be ſubjected to reparation, if he have acted to the beſt of his judgement. This rule, however, muſt be taken with a limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a groſs error will not excuſe a public officer, who ought to know better.</p>
                  <p>It is ſcarce neceſſary to obſerve, that a man is not accountable for any harm he does by an involuntary act. A maſon, for example, tumbling from a ſcaffold, happens in falling to wound one below: his conſcience blames him not for what he could not help; and there is nothing in his conduct to lay hold of, for ſubjecting him to repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it is not ſufficient that one of ſeveral connected actions be involuntary; for reparation may be claimed, though the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate act be involuntary, provided it be connected with a preceding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0743600300:39"/>
voluntary act. Example: <q rend="inline">"If A ride an unruly horſe in Lincolns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inn-fields to tame him, and the horſe breaking from A run over B, and grievouſly hurt him; B ſhall have an action againſt A. For though the miſchief was done againſt the will of A, yet ſince it was his fault to bring a wild horſe into a frequented place where miſchief might enſue, he muſt anſwer for the conſequences."</q> Gaius ſeems to carry this rule ſtill further, holding in general, that if a horſe, by the weakneſs or unſkilfulneſs of the rider, break away and do miſchief, the rider is liable <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 8. § 1. ad. leg. Aquil.</note>. But Gaius probably had in his eye a frequented place, where the miſchief might have been foreſeen. Thus, in general, a man is made liable for the miſchief occaſioned by his voluntary act, though the immediate cauſe of the miſchief be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary.</p>

                  <p>BY our ſenſes, external and internal, we are made acquainted with objects external and internal, and with their qualities: knowledge ſo acquired is termed <hi>intuitive,</hi> becauſe we acquire more knowledge by ſight or intuition than by any other of our ſenſes. The reaſoning faculty inveſtigates truth by a regular progreſs from premiſes to conſequences; and, upon that account, knowledge ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired may be termed <hi>diſcurſive.</hi> Thus certain properties of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, and of a ſquare, are laid open to us by reaſoning; and the knowledge we thereby acquire is diſcurſive. Of the different degrees of conviction, the very higheſt belongs to intuitive knowledge: and it ought to be ſo, becauſe this ſpecies of knowledge is acquired by perception alone; which is not only a ſingle mental act, but is alſo complete in itſelf, having no dependence on any thing antecedent: whereas diſcurſive knowledge requires, not only a plurality of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal acts, but alſo one or more intuitive propoſitions to found upon. We accordingly rely more upon intuitive knowledge than upon the ſtricteſt reaſoning: witneſs external objects, of whoſe exiſtence we have a more ſolid conviction than of any propoſition in Euclid. The application of this doctrine to morality, will be obvious at firſt view.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0743600300:40"/>
By perception alone, without reaſoning, we acquire the knowledge of right and of wrong, of what we may do, of what we ought to do, and of what we ought to abſtain from: and conſidering that we have thus a greater certainty of the moral laws than of any propoſition diſcovered by reaſoning, man may well be deemed the favourite of Heaven, when ſuch wiſdom is employ'd in qualifying him to act a right part in life: the moral ſenſe or conſcience may well be held the voice of God within us, conſtantly admoniſhing us of our duty; and requiring on our part no exerciſe of our faculties but attention merely. The celebrated Locke ventured what he thought a bold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that the moral duties may be capable of demonſtration: how great his ſurpriſe to have been told, that they are capable of much higher evidence!</p>
                  <p>It would be loſing time to indicate the final cauſe of eſtabliſhing morality upon intuitive knowledge. Let us only conſider what muſt have been our condition, had we been left to the glimmering light of reaſon. This faculty is diſtributed among men in portions ſo unequal, as to bar all hopes from it of uniformity, either in opinion or in action. Reaſon, it is true, aided by experience, may ſupport morality, by convincing us that we cannot be happy if we abandon our duty for any other intereſt: but reaſon, even with experience, ſeldom weighs much againſt paſſion; and to reſtrain its impetuoſity, nothing leſs is requiſite than the vigorous and commanding principle of duty, directed by the ſhining light of intuition.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond final cauſe reſpecting alſo morality in general, reſults from the connection above mentioned between right and agreeable in human actions, and between wrong and diſagreeable. Were our duty diſagreeable, man would be an inconſiſtent being; for his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would be conſtantly in oppoſition to his duty. To miſlead us from our duty, even though agreeable, there are ſo many temptations, that it is no eaſy taſk to keep the ſtraight road: would we perſevere in it if our duty were diſagreeable?</p>
                  <p>As the moral duties above mentioned are obviouſly calculated for the good of ſociety, it might be thought, that, inſtead of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duties, all ſhould be reduced to a ſingle general rule, that of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing in our power for the good of ſociety. But I ſhall endeavour to evince, that this imagined ſyſtem, however plauſible, is neither ſuited to the end propoſed by it, nor to the nature of man; and in the courſe of the argument it will be ſeen, with what ſuperior wiſdom the true ſyſtem of morality is contrived, which will ſet its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe in a conſpicuous light. It has been ſhown how eſſential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0743600300:41"/>
knowledge is to the performance of our duty: and I begin with examining what place there might be for intuitive knowledge in the propoſed ſyſtem. As the general good of mankind reſults from many and various circumſtances intricately combined, that good may be a ſubject for reaſoning, but never can be an object of intuitive knowledge. But reaſon employ'd in weighing an endleſs number and variety of circumſtances, ſeldom affords any ſolid conviction; and upon the propoſed ſyſtem we would be often left in the dark about our duty, however upright our intentions might be. At the ſame time, we would in vain expect from ſuch faint conviction, authority ſufficient to counterbalance the influence of paſſion: our duty would vaniſh from our ſight in a maze of ſubtilties; and ſelf-partiality would always ſuggeſt plauſible reaſons, for ſlight tranſgreſſions at firſt, and afterward for the very boldeſt. It is therefore order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with conſummate wiſdom, even for the general good, that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding general and complex objects, the moral ſenſe ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to certain particular acts, and their effects; which, being plain and ſimple, can be made our duty by intuitive perception.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, to make univerſal benevolence our duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction of perſons or circumſtances, would in effect ſubject us to the abſurd and impracticable duty, of ſerving at the ſame inſtant an endleſs number and variety of perſons; which, inſtead of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the general good, would evidently be detrimental, by unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying us to perform any part.</p>
                  <p>The true ſyſtem of morality, that which is diſplay'd above, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuited to the limited powers of man; and yet is contrived in the moſt perfect manner for promoting the general good. There is no occaſion to loſe time in demonſtrating, that a man entirely ſelfiſh is ill fitted for ſociety; and we have ſeen, that univerſal benevolence, conſidered as a duty, would contribute to the general good perhaps leſs than abſolute ſelfiſhneſs. Man is much better fitted for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, by having in his conſtitution the principles of ſelf-love and of benevolence duly proportioned. Benevolence, as far as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, takes place of ſelf-love; which is wiſely ordered, becauſe ſo far it is eſſential to the very conſtitution of ſociety. Benevolence, again, as a virtue not a duty, gives place to ſelf-love; which is ordered with equal wiſdom, becauſe every man has more power, knowledge, and opportunity, to promote his own good, than that of others: by which means more good is actually produced, than if we were entirely ſurrendered to benevolence. At the ſame time, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of benevolence is as extenſive as can conſiſt with the limited capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0743600300:42"/>
of man: the chief objects of his affection are his relations, his friends, his benefactors, to ſerve whom he is bound in duty: ſome ſhare of benevolence is reſerved for his neighbours, and even for thoſe he is barely acquainted with; and to make benevolence more extenſive, would be entirely fruitleſs, becauſe here are objects in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to fill the moſt capacious mind. But though there is not room for a greater variety of particular objects, yet the faculty we have of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting numberleſs individuals into one complex object, enlarges great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſphere of our benevolence: for by this power, our country, our religion, our conſtitution, become objects of the moſt vigorous affection and public ſpirit. The individuals that compoſe the group, conſidered apart, may be too minute, or too diſtant, for our benevolence; but when comprehended under one view, they become a complex object that warms and dilates the heart. By that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful faculty, the limited capacity of our nature is remedied; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant objects, otherwiſe inviſible, are rendered conſpicuous; accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation makes them great; greatneſs brings them near the eye; and affection, preſerved entire, is beſtow'd upon a complex object, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one that is ſingle and viſible; but with much greater force in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its ſuperior importance.</p>
                  <p>We now proceed to particulars; and the firſt that meets us is the great law of reſtraint. Man is evidently framed for ſociety; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be no ſociety among creatures who prey upon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was neceſſary, in the firſt place, to provide againſt mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; which is effectually done by this law. Its neceſſity with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to perſonal ſecurity is ſelf-evident; and its neceſſity with reſpect to matters of property, will be evident from what follows. There is in the nature of man a propenſity to hoard or ſtore up the means of ſubſiſtence; a propenſity eſſential to our well-being, by prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to provide for ourſelves, and for thoſe who depend on us. But this natural propenſity would be rendered ineffectual, were we not ſecured in the poſſeſſion of what we thus ſtore up; for a man will never toil to accumulate what he cannot ſecurely poſſeſs. This ſecurity is afforded by the moral ſenſe; which dictates to all men, that goods ſtored up by individuals are their <hi>property,</hi> and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ought to be inviolable. Thus, by the great law of reſtraint, men have a protection for their goods, as well as for their perſons or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and have not leſs ſecurity in ſociety than if they were ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from each other by impregnable fortreſſes.</p>
                  <p>If the law of reſtraint be eſſential to the exiſtence of ſociety, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other duties are not leſs ſo. Mutual truſt and confidence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0743600300:43"/>
which there can be no ſociety, enter into the character of the human ſpecies; correſponding to which are the duties of veracity and fidelity: the latter would be of no ſignificancy without the former; and the former without the latter would be hurtful, by laying men open to fraud and deceit.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to veracity, in particular, ſuch is our ſituation in this world, as to be indebted to the information of others for almoſt every thing that can benefit or hurt us; and if we could not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on information, ſociety would be very little beneficial. Further, it is wiſely ordered, that we ſhould adhere ſtrictly to truth, even where we perceive no harm in tranſgreſſing that duty; for it is ſufficient that harm may poſſibly enſue, though not foreſeen. At the ſame time, falſehood always does miſchief; for if it happen not to injure us externally in our reputation, or in our goods, it never fails to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure us internally; which will thus appear. Men were made for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and one great bleſſing of that ſtate is a candid intercourſe of hearts in converſation, in communication of ſentiments, of opinions, of deſires, and of wiſhes; and to admit any falſehood or deceit into ſuch intercourſe, would poiſon the moſt refined pleaſures of life.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe man is the weakeſt of all animals ſeparately, and the very ſtrongeſt in ſociety, mutual aſſiſtance is one great end in the ſocial ſtate; to which end it is neceſſary that covenants and promiſes be binding, and that favours received be thankfully repaid.</p>
                  <p>The final cauſe of the law of propriety, which inforces the duty we owe to ourſelves, comes next in order. In a diſcourſe upon thoſe laws of nature which concern ſociety, we have no occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any ſelf-duty but what is connected with ſociety; ſuch as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, temperance, induſtry, firmneſs of mind, &amp;c. And that theſe ſhould be made our duty, is wiſely ordered in a double reſpect; firſt as qualifying us to act our part in ſociety; and next as intitling us to the good will of others. It is the intereſt, no doubt, of every man to ſuit his behaviour to the dignity of his nature, and to the ſtation allotted him by Providence; for ſuch rational conduct contributes to happineſs, by preſerving health, by procuring plenty, by gaining the eſteem of others, and, which of all is the greateſt bleſſing, by gaining a juſtly founded ſelf-eſteem. But here even ſelf-intereſt is not relied on: the powerful authority of duty is ſuperadded to the motive of intereſt, that in a matter of the utmoſt importance both to ourſelves and to the ſociety we live in, our conduct may be ſteady and regular. Theſe duties tend not only to make a man happy in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0743600300:44"/>
himſelf, but alſo, by gaining the good-will and eſteem of others, to command their help and aſſiſtance in time of need.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to the final cauſes of natural rewards and puniſhments. And what at firſt will occur to every one is, that right and wrong ought to be the rule for diſtributing rewards and puniſhments, as well as for determining civil claims; for does it not ſeem rational that a right action ſhould be rewarded, and a wrong action puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? But, upon more mature reflection, we are forc'd to abandon that opinion. All civil claims, and all controverſies about things, muſt be adjuſted by the ſtandard of right and wrong; for where parties differ about <hi>meum et tuum,</hi> the plaintiff's opinion cannot be the rule, and as little the defendant's: there muſt be an appeal to a judge; and what rule has a judge for determining the controverſy, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the common ſenſe of mankind about right and wrong? But to bring rewards and puniſhments under the ſame ſtandard, without regarding private conſcience, would be a ſyſtem unworthy of our maker; it being extremely clear, that to reward one who is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of merit, or to puniſh one who is not conſcious of guilt, can never anſwer any good end; and, in particular, cannot tend either to improvement, or reformation of manners. How much more like the Deity is the plan of nature; which rewards no man who is not conſcious that he ought to be rewarded, and puniſhes no man who is not conſcious that he ought to be puniſhed! By theſe means, and by theſe only, rewards and puniſhments attain every good end that can be propoſed by them. Here is a final cauſe moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious!</p>
                  <p>The rewards and puniſhments that attend the primary and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary virtues, are finely adjuſted for ſupporting the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them ſet forth above. Puniſhment muſt be confined to the tranſgreſſion of primary virtues, it being the intention of nature that the ſecondary virtues ſhould be entirely voluntary. On the other hand, the ſecondary virtues are more highly rewarded than the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary: generoſity, for example, makes a greater figure than juſtice; and undaunted courage, magnanimity, heroiſm, riſe ſtill higher in our eſteem. One would imagine at firſt view, that the primary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, being more eſſential, ſhould be intitled to the firſt place in our eſteem, and be more amply rewarded than the ſecondary; and yet nature, in elevating the latter above the former, hath taken her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with peculiar wiſdom and foreſight. Puniſhment is reſerved to inforce the primary virtues; and if theſe virtues were alſo accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the higher rewards, the ſecondary virtues, brought down
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0743600300:45"/>
to a lower rank, would loſe entirely that warm enthuſiaſtic admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is their chief ſupport: ſelf-intereſt would univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over benevolence, and ſap the very foundation of thoſe number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs favours we receive from each other in ſociety; favours, not only beneficial in point of intereſt, but a ſolid foundation for affection and friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>In our progreſs through final cauſes, we come at laſt to reparation, one of the principles deſtined by Providence, for redreſſing wrongs committed, and for preventing the reiteration of them. The final cauſe of the principle of reparation, when the miſchief ariſes from intention, is ſelf-evident: for, to afford ſecurity to individuals in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, it is not ſufficient that the man who does intentional miſchief be puniſhed; it is neceſſary that he alſo be bound to repair the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. Secondly, Where the act is wrong or unjuſt, though not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the author to be ſo, it is wiſely ordered that reparation ſhould follow; and, in general, that no error, whether in law or in fact, ſhould avail againſt this claim; which will thus appear. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the fallibility of man, it would be too ſevere to permit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to be taken of error in every caſe. On the other hand, to make it a law in our nature, never to take advantage of error in any caſe, would be giving too much indulgence to indolence and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mind, tending to make us neglect the improvement of our rational faculties. Our nature is ſo happily framed as to avoid theſe extremes, by diſtinguiſhing between gain and loſs. No man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of wrong, when he takes advantage of an error committed by another to ſave himſelf from loſs: if there muſt be a loſs, common ſenſe dictates, that it ought to reſt upon the perſon who has err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however innocently, rather than upon him who has not erred. Thus, in a competition among creditors about the eſtate of their bankrupt debtor, every one is at liberty to avail himſelf of even the ſlighteſt defects in the titles of his competitors, in order to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from loſs. But, <hi>in lucro captando,</hi> the moral ſenſe teacheth a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent leſſon; which is, that no man ought to take advantage of another's error to make gain by it. Thus, an heir finding a brute diamond in the repoſitories of his anceſtor, ſells the ſame for a trifle, miſtaking it for a common pebble: the purchaſer is, in conſcience and in equity, bound to reſtore the ſame, or to pay a juſt price. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The following conſiderations tend to unfold a final cauſe, not leſs beautiful than the foregoing, of what the moral ſenſe dictates with reſpect to miſchief done without intention. Society could not ſubſiſt in any tolerable manner, were full ſcope given to raſhneſs and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0743600300:46"/>
and to every action that is not ſtrictly criminal: whence it is a maxim, founded not leſs upon utility than upon juſtice, That men living in ſociety ought to be extremely circumſpect as to every action that may poſſibly do harm. On the other hand, it is alſo a maxim, That as the proſperity and happineſs of man depend on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, activity ought to be encouraged, inſtead of being diſcouraged by the dread of conſequences. Theſe maxims, ſeemingly in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, have natural limits that prevent their incroaching upon each other; which limits, at the ſame time, produce the moſt good to ſociety of all that can be contrived by the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate lawgiver. There is a certain degree of attention and circumſpection that men generally beſtow upon affairs, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to their importance: if that degree were not ſufficient to defend againſt a claim of reparation, individuals would be too much cramped in action; which would lead to indolence inſtead of activity: if a leſs degree were ſufficient, there would be too great ſcope for raſh or remiſs conduct; which would prove the bane of ſociety. Theſe remarks concerning the good of ſociety, coincide en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely with what the moral ſenſe dictates, as above mentioned, that the man who acts with foreſight of the probability of miſchief, or acts raſhly and incautiouſly without ſuch foreſight, ought to be liable for the conſequences; but that the man who acts cautiouſly, without fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing or ſuſpecting that any miſchief will enſue, and who therefore is entirely innocent, ought not to be liable for the conſequences.</p>
                  <p>And upon this ſubject I add the final cauſe of what is explained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, <hi>viz.</hi> That the moral ſenſe requires from every man, not his own degree of vigilance and attention, which may be very ſmall, but that which belongs to the common nature of the ſpecies. That this is a wiſe regulation, will appear upon conſidering, that were repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to depend upon perſonal circumſtances, there would be a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of inquiring into the characters of men, their education, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, and the extent of their underſtanding; which would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judges arbitrary, and ſuch law-ſuits inextricable. But by aſſuming the common nature of the ſpecies as a ſtandard, by which every man in conſcience judges of his own actions, law-ſuits about reparation are rendered eaſy and expeditious.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>EQUITY, ſcarce known to our forefathers, makes at preſent a great figure: like a plant gradually tending to maturity, it has for ages been increaſing in bulk, ſlowly indeed but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; and at what diſtance of time we are to hope for its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, is perhaps not eaſy to foretell. Courts of equity have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquired ſuch an extent of juriſdiction, as to obſcure in a great meaſure that of the courts of law. A revolution ſo ſignal, will move every curious inquirer to attempt, or to wiſh at leaſt, a diſcovery of the cauſe. But vain will be the attempt, till firſt a clear idea be formed of the difference between law and equity. The former we know deals in preciſe rules: but does the latter reſt on conſcience ſolely without any rule? This would be unſafe while men are judges, liable not leſs to partiality than to error: nor could a court, without rules, ever have attained that height of favour, and extent of juriſdiction, which courts of equity enjoy. But if a court of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity be governed by any rules or principles, why are not theſe brought to light in a ſyſtem? One would imagine, that ſuch a ſyſtem ſhould not be uſeful only, but abſolutely neceſſary; and yet writers, far from aiming at a ſyſtem, have not even defined with any accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy what equity is, nor what are its limits and extent. One opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of equity, univerſally acknowledged, is, to remedy imperfections in the common law, which ſometimes is defective, and ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds juſt bounds; and as equity is conſtantly oppoſed to common law, a juſt idea of the latter may probably lead to the former. In order to aſcertain what is meant by common law, a hiſtorical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction is neceſſary; which I the more chearfully undertake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſubject ſeems not to be put in a clear light by any writer.</p>
               <p>After ſtates were formed and government eſtabliſhed, courts of law were invented to compel individuals to do their duty. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, as generally happens, was at firſt confined within narrow bounds. To theſe courts was given power to inforce duties eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the exiſtence of ſociety; ſuch as that of forbearing to do harm or miſchief: power was alſo given to inforce duties derived from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants and promiſes, ſuch of them at leaſt as tend more peculiarly to the well-being of ſociety: which was an improvement ſo great as to leave no thought of proceeding farther; for to extend the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a court to natural duties of every ſort, would, in a new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0743600300:48"/>
have been reckoned too bold. Thus, in the Roman law, we find many pactions left upon conſcience, without receiving any aid from their courts of law: buying and ſelling only, with a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther covenants eſſential to commercial dealing, were regarded. Our courts of law in Britain were originally confined within ſtill narrower bounds: no covenant whatever was by our forefathers countenanced with an action: a contract of buying and ſelling was not <note n="*" place="bottom">Reg. Maj. lib. 3. cap. 10. Fleta, lib. 2. cap. 58. § 3, and 5.</note>; and as buying and ſelling is of all covenants the moſt uſeful in common life, we are not at liberty to ſuppoſe that any other was more privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <note n="†" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical Law-tracts, tract 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>But when the great advantages of a court of law were experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, its juriſdiction was gradually extended, with univerſal approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it was extended, with very few exceptions, to every covenant and every promiſe: it was extended alſo to other matters, till it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced every obvious duty ariſing in common and ordinary dealings between man and man. But it was extended no farther; experience having diſcovered limits, beyond which it was deemed hazardous to ſtretch this juriſdiction. Cauſes of an extraordinary nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſome ſingular remedy, could not be ſafely truſted with the ordinary courts, becauſe no rules were eſtabliſhed to direct their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in ſuch matters; and upon that account, ſuch cauſes were appropriated to the king and council, being the paramount court <note n="a" place="bottom">We find the ſame regulation among the Jews: <q rend="inline">"And Moſes choſe able men out of all Iſrael, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thouſands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And they judged the people at all ſeaſons: the hard cauſes they brought unto Moſes, but every ſmall matter they judged themſelves;"</q> 
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Exodus</hi> xviii. 25. 26.</bibl>
                  </note>. Of this nature were actions for proving the tenor or contents of a loſt writ; extraordinary removings againſt tenants poſſeſſing by leaſe; the cauſes of pupils, orphans, and foreigners; complaints againſt judges and officers of law <note n="‡" place="bottom">See act 105. parl. 1487.</note>, and the more atrocious crimes, termed, <hi>the pleas of the crown.</hi> Such extraordinary caſes, multiplying great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by complex and intricate connections among individuals, daily diſcovered, became a burden too great for the king and council. In order therefore to relieve this court, extraordinary cauſes of a civil nature, were in England devolved upon the court of chancery; a meaſure the more neceſſary, that the king, occupied with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous affairs of government, and with foreign as well as domeſtic tranſactions, had not leiſure for private cauſes. In Scotland, more
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0743600300:49"/>
remote, and therefore leſs intereſted in foreign affairs, there was not the ſame neceſſity for this innovation: our kings, however, addicted more to action than to contemplation, neglected in a great meaſure their privilege of being judges, and ſuffered cauſes peculiar to the king and council to be gradually aſſumed by other ſovereign courts. The eſtabliſhment of the court of chancery in England, made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give a name to the more ordinary branch of law that is the province of the common or ordinary courts: it is termed, <hi>the Common Law:</hi> and in oppoſition to it, the extraordinary branch devolved on the court of chancery is termed <hi>Equity;</hi> the name being derived from the nature of the juriſdiction, directed leſs by preciſe rules, than <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum aequum et bonum,</hi> or according to what the judge in conſcience thinks right <note n="a" place="bottom">At curiae ſunto et juriſdictiones, quae ſtatuant ex arbitrio boni viri et diſcretione ſana, ubi legis norma deficit. Lex enim non ſufficit caſibus, ſed ad ea quae plerumque accidunt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur: ſapientiſſima autem res tempus, (ut ab antiquis dictum eſt), et novorum caſuum quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidie author et inventor. <bibl>Bacon de Aug.

                     </bibl>
                  </note>. Thus equity, in its proper ſenſe, comprehends e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very matter of law that by the common law is left without remedy; and ſuppoſing the boundaries of the common law to be aſcertained, there can no longer remain any difficulty about the powers of a court of equity. But as theſe boundaries are not aſcertained by any natural principle, the juriſdiction of common law muſt depend in a great meaſure upon accident and arbitrary practice; and accordingly the boundaries of common law and equity, vary in different countries, and at different times in the ſame country. We have ſeen, that the common law of Britain was originally not ſo extenſive as at preſent; and inſtances will be mentioned afterward, which evince, that the common law in Scotland is farther extended than in England. Its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits are perhaps not accurately aſcertained in any country; which is to be regretted, becauſe of the uncertainty that muſt follow in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of law. It is lucky, however, that the diſeaſe is not incurable: a good underſtanding between the judges of the different courts, with juſt notions of law, may, in time, aſcertain theſe limits with ſufficient accuracy.</p>
               <p>Among a plain people, ſtrangers to refinement and ſubtilties, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits may be frequent, but never are intricate. Regulations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain individuals from doing miſchief, and to inforce performance of covenants, compoſed originally the bulk of the common law; and theſe two branches, among our rude anceſtors, ſeemed to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend every ſubject of law. The more refined duties of morality were,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0743600300:50"/>
in that early period, little felt, and leſs regarded. But law, in this ſimple form, cannot long continue ſtationary: for in the ſocial ſtate under regular diſcipline, law ripens gradually with the human facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and by ripeneſs of diſcernment, and delicacy of ſentiment, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties, formerly neglected, are found to be binding in conſcience. Such duties can no longer be neglected by courts of juſtice; and as they made no part of the common law, they come naturally under the juriſdiction of a court of equity.</p>
               <p>The chief objects of benevolence conſidered as a duty, are our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, our benefactors, our maſters, our ſervants, &amp;c.; and theſe duties, or the moſt obvious of them, come under the cogniſance of common law. But there are other connections which, though more tranſitory, produce a ſenſe of duty. Two perſons ſhut up in the ſame priſon, perhaps for different cauſes, being no way connected but by contiguity, and reſemblance of condition, are ſenſible, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that to aid and comfort each other is a duty incumbent on them. Two perſons ſhipwrecked upon the ſame deſert iſland, are ſenſible of the like mutual duty. And there is even ſome ſenſe of this kind, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a number of perſons in the ſame ſhip, or under the ſame mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary command.</p>
               <p>Thus mutual duties among individuals multiply by variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections; and in the progreſs of ſociety, benevolence becomes a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſcience in a thouſand inſtances which formerly were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſregarded. The duties that ariſe from connections ſo ſlender, are taken under the juriſdiction of a court of equity; which at firſt exerciſeth its juriſdiction with great reſerve, interpoſing in remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able caſes only, where the duty is palpable. But, gathering cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from ſucceſs, it ventures to inforce this duty in more delicate circumſtances: one caſe throws light upon another: men, by the reaſoning of the judges, become gradually more acute in diſcerning their duty: the judges become more and more acute in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſes; and this branch of law is imperceptibly moulded into a ſyſtem <note n="a" place="bottom">At curiae illae uni viro ne committantur, ſed ex pluribus conſtent. Nec decreta exeant cum ſilentio: ſed judices ſententiae ſuae rationes adducant, idque palam, atque adſtante co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona; ut quod ipſa poteſtate ſit liberum, fama tamen et exiſtimatione ſit circumſcriptum. <bibl>Bacon de Aug.

                     </bibl>
                  </note>. In rude ages, acts of benevolence, however peculiar the connection may be, are but faintly perceived to be our duty: ſuch perceptions become gradually more firm and clear by cuſtom and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0743600300:51"/>
and when men are ſo far enlightened, it is the duty as well as honour of judges to interpoſe <note n="*" place="bottom">See Eſſays on morality and natural religion, ſecond edition, p. 108.</note>.</p>
               <p>This branch of equitable juriſdiction ſhall be illuſtrated by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious examples. When goods by labour, and perhaps with danger, are recovered from the ſea after a ſhipwreck, every one perceives it to be the duty of the proprietor to pay ſalvage. A man ventures his life to ſave a houſe from fire, and is ſucceſsful; no mortal can doubt that he is intitled to a recompence from the proprietor, who is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited. If a man's affairs by his abſence be in diſorder, is not the friend who undertakes the management, intitled to a recompence, though the ſubject upon which his money was uſefully beſtowed may have afterward periſhed caſually? Who can doubt of the following propoſition, That I am in the wrong to demand money from my debtor, while I with-hold the ſum I owe him, which perhaps may be his only reſource for doing me juſtice? Such a proceeding muſt, in the common ſenſe of mankind, appear partial and oppreſſive. By the common law, however, no remedy is afforded in this caſe, nor in the others mentioned. But equity affords a remedy, by inforcing what in ſuch circumſtances every man perceives to be his duty. I ſhall add but one example more: In a violent ſtorm, the heavieſt goods are thrown overboard, in order to diſburden the ſhip: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of the goods preſerved by this means from the ſea, muſt be ſenſible that it is their duty to repair the loſs; for the man who has thus abandoned his goods for the common ſafety, ought to be in no worſe condition than themſelves. Equity dictates this to be their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if they be refractory, a court of equity will interpoſe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the ſufferer.</p>
               <p>It appears now clearly, that a court of equity commences at the limits of the common law, and in certain circumſtances neglected by common law, enforces benevolence where the law of nature makes it our duty. And thus a court of equity, accompanying the law of nature in its gradual refinements, enforces every natural duty that is not provided for by common law.</p>
               <p>The duties hitherto mentioned ariſe from connections independent altogether of conſent. Covenants and promiſes alſo, are the ſource of various connections, and of various duties. The moſt obvious of theſe duties, being commonly declared in words, belong to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law. But every incident that can poſſibly occur in fulfilling a covenant, is ſeldom foreſeen; and yet a court of common law, in giving judgment upon covenants, conſiders nothing but declared will,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0743600300:52"/>
neglecting incidents that would have been provided for had they been foreſeen. Further, the inductive motive for making a covenant, and its ultimate purpoſe and intendment, are circumſtances diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded at common law: theſe, however, are capital circumſtances; and juſtice, where they are neglected, cannot be fulfilled. Hence the powers of a court of equity with reſpect to engagements. It ſupplies imperfections in common law, by taking under conſideration every material circumſtance, in order that juſtice may be diſtributed in the moſt perfect manner. It ſometimes ſupplies a defect in words, where will is evidently more extenſive; and ſometimes ſupplies a defect even in will, according to what probably would have been the will of the parties had they foreſeen the event. By taking ſuch liberty, a covenant is made effectual according to the aim and purpoſe of the contracters; and without ſuch liberty, ſeldom it happens that juſtice can be accurately diſtributed.</p>
               <p>In handling this branch of the ſubject, it is not eaſy to ſuppreſs a thought that comes croſs the mind. The juriſdiction of a court of common law, with reſpect to covenants, appears to me odd and unaccountable. To find the juriſdiction of this court limited, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, to certain duties of the law of nature, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the whole, is not ſingular nor ſurpriſing. But with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the circumſtances that occur in the ſame cauſe, it cannot fail to appear ſingular, that a court ſhould be confined to a few of theſe circumſtances, neglecting others not leſs material in point of juſtice. This reflection will be ſet in a clear light by a ſingle example. Every one knows, that an Engliſh double bond was a contrivance to evade the old law of this iſland, which prohibited the taking intereſt for money: the profeſſed purpoſe of this bond is, to provide for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and coſts; beyond which the penal part ought not to be exacted: and yet a court of common law, confined ſtrictly to the words or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared will, is neceſſitated knowingly to commit injuſtice. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the term of payment is paſt, when there cannot be either coſts or intereſt, this court, inſtead of pronouncing ſentence for what is really due, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſum borrowed, muſt follow the words of the bond, and give judgement for the double. This defect in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a court, is too remarkable to have been overlooked: a remedy accordingly is provided, though far from being of the moſt perfect kind; and that is, a privilege to apply to the court of equity for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. Far better had it been, either to withdraw covenants altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the common law, or to impower the judges of that law
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0743600300:53"/>
to determine according to the principles of juſtice <note n="a" place="bottom">And accordingly, by 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Annae, cap. 16. § 13. the defendant, pending action on a double bond, offering payment of principal, intereſt, and coſts, ſhall be diſcharged by the court.</note>. I need ſcarce obſerve, that the preſent reflection regards England only, where equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and common law are appropriated to different courts. In Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and other countries where both belong to the ſame court, the inconvenience mentioned cannot happen. But to return to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual extenſion of equity, which is our preſent theme:</p>
               <p>A court of equity, by long and various practice, finding its own ſtrength and utility, and impelled by the principle of juſtice, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertakes a matter ſtill more arduous; and that is, to correct or mitigate the rigour, and what even in a proper ſenſe may be termed the <hi>injuſtice of common law.</hi> It is not in human foreſight to eſtabliſh any general rule, that, however ſalutary in the main, may not be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive and unjuſt when applied to ſome ſingular caſes. Every work of man muſt partake of the imperfection of its author; ſometimes falling ſhort of its purpoſe, and ſometimes going beyond it. If, with reſpect to the former, a court of equity be uſeful, it may be pronounced neceſſary with reſpect to the latter; for, in ſociety, it is certainly a greater object to prevent legal oppreſſion, which alarms every individual, than to ſupply legal defects, ſcarce regarded but by thoſe immediately concerned. The illuſtrious Bacon, upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, expreſſes himſelf with great propriety: <q rend="inline">"Habeant curiae prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriae poteſtatem tam ſubveniendi contra rigorem legis, quam ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendi defectum legis. Si enim porrigi debet remedium ei quem lex praeteriit, multo magis ei quem vulneravit <note n="*" place="bottom">De Aug. Scient. lib. 8. cap. 3. aph. 35.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>All the variety of matter hitherto mentioned, is regulated by the principle of juſtice ſolely. It may, at firſt view, be thought, that this takes in the whole compaſs of law, and that there is no remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing field to be occupied by a court of equity. But, upon more narrow inſpection, we find a number of law-caſes into which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice enters not, but only the principle of utility. Expediency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that theſe be brought under the cogniſance of a court; and the court of equity, gaining daily more weight and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, takes naturally ſuch matters under its juriſdiction. I ſhall give a few examples. A laviſh man ſubmits to have his ſon made his interdictor: this agreement is not unjuſt; but tending to the corruption of manners, by reverſing the order of nature, it is reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a court of equity, as <hi>contra bonos mores.</hi> This court goes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0743600300:54"/>
it diſcountenances many things in themſelves indifferent, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe of their bad tendency. A <hi>pactum de quota litis</hi> is in itſelf innocent, and may be beneficial to the client as well as to the advocate: but to remove the temptation from advocates to take advantage of their clients, inſtead of ſerving them faithfully, this court declares againſt ſuch pactions. A court of equity goes ſtill farther, by conſulting the public intereſt with relation to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not otherwiſe bad but by occaſioning unneceſſary trouble and vexation to individuals. Hence the origin of regulations tending to abridge law-ſuits.</p>
               <p>A miſchief that affects the whole community figures in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and will naturally move judges to ſtretch out a preventive hand. But what ſhall we ſay of a miſchief that affects one perſon only, or but a few? An eſtate, for example, real or perſonal, is left entirely without management, by the infancy of the proprietor, or by his abſence in a remote country: he has no friends, or they are unwilling to interpoſe. It is natural, in this caſe, to apply for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic authority. A court of common law, confined within certain preciſe limits, can give no aid; and therefore it is neceſſary that a court of equity ſhould undertake caſes of this kind; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive remedy is eaſy, by naming an adminiſtrator, or, as termed in the Roman law, <hi>curator bonorum.</hi> A ſimilar example is, where a court of equity gives authority to ſell the land of one under age, when the ſale is neceſſary for payment of debt: to decline interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in this caſe, would be ruinous to the proprietor; for without it no man will venture to purchaſe from one under age. Here the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is humanity to a ſingle individual: but it would be a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in law, to abandon an innocent perſon to ruin when the remedy is ſo eaſy. In the caſes governed by the motive of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic utility, a court of equity interpoſes as a court properly, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or denying action, in order to anſwer the end propoſed: but in the caſes now mentioned, and in thoſe that are ſimilar, there is ſeldom occaſion for a proceſs; the court acts by magiſterial powers.</p>
               <p>The powers above ſet forth aſſumed by our courts of equity, are, in effect, the ſame that were aſſumed by the Roman Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, from neceſſity, without any expreſs authority. <q rend="inline">"Jus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium eſt quod praetores introduxerunt, adjuvandi vel ſupplendi vel corrigendi juris Civilis gratia, propter utilitatem publicam <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 7. § 1. de juſtitia et jure.</note>."</q>

Having given a hiſtorical view of a court of equity, from its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to its preſent extent of power and juriſdiction, I proceed to ſome other general matters, which muſt be premiſed before entering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particulars. The firſt I ſhall inſiſt on is of the greateſt moment, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a court of equity be, or ought to be, governed by any general rules? To determine every particular caſe according to what is juſt, equal, and ſalutary, taking in all circumſtances, is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the idea of a court of equity in its perfection; and had we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for judges, ſuch would be their method of proceeding, without regarding any rules: but men are liable to prejudice and error, and for that reaſon cannot ſafely be truſted with unlimited powers. Hence the neceſſity of eſtabliſhing rules, to preſerve uniformity of judgement in matters of equity as well as of common law: the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is perhaps greater in the former, becauſe of the variety and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of equitable circumſtances. Thus though a particular caſe may require the interpoſition of equity to correct a wrong or ſupply a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet the judge ought not to interpoſe, unleſs he can found his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree upon ſome rule that is equally applicable to all caſes of the kind. If he be under no limitation, his decrees will appear arbitrary, though ſubſtantially juſt: and, which is ſtill worſe, will often be arbitrary, and ſubſtantially unjuſt; for ſuch too frequently is the caſe of human proceedings when ſubjected to no control. General rules, it is true, muſt often produce decrees that are materially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; for no rule can be equally juſt in its application to a whole claſs of caſes that are far from being the ſame in every circumſtance: but this inconvenience muſt be tolerated, to avoid a greater, that of making judges arbitrary. A court of equity is a happy invention to remedy the errors of common law: but this remedy muſt ſtop ſome where; for courts cannot be eſtabliſhed without end, to be checks one upon another. And hence it is, that, in the nature of things, there cannot be any other check upon a court of equity but general rules. Bacon expreſſes himſelf upon this ſubject with his uſual ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and perſpicuity: <q rend="inline">"Non ſine cauſa in uſum venerat apud Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manos album praetoris, in quo praeſcripſit et publicavit quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo ipſe jus dicturus eſſet. Quo exemplo judices in curiis praetoriis, regulas ſibi certas (quantum fieri poteſt) proponere, eaſque publice affigere, debent. Etenim optima eſt lex, quae minimum relinquit arbitrio judicis, optimus judex qui minimum ſibi <note n="*" place="bottom">De aug. ſcient. l. 8. cap 3. aph. 46.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In peruſing the following treatiſe, it will be diſcovered, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0743600300:56"/>
regarded by a court of equity ſeldom ariſe from perſonal circumſtances, ſuch as birth, reſemblance of condition, or even blood, but generally from ſubjects that in common language are denominated <hi>goods.</hi> Why ſhould a court, actuated by the ſpirit of refined juſtice, overlook more ſubſtantial ties, to apply itſelf to the groſſer connections ſolely, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of intereſt? doth any connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion founded on property make an impreſſion equally ſtrong with that of friendſhip, of blood-relation, or of country? doth not the law of nature form duties on the latter, more binding in conſcience than thoſe formed on the former? Yet the more conſcientious duties are left generally to ſhift for themſelves, while the duties founded on intereſt are ſupported and inforced by courts of equity. This, at firſt view, looks like a prevailing attachment to riches; but it is not ſo in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The duties ariſing from the connection laſt mentioned, are generally aſcertained and circumſcribed, ſo as to be ſuſceptible of a general rule that governs all caſes of the kind. This is ſeldom the caſe of the other natural duties; which, for that reaſon, muſt be left upon conſcience, without receiving any aid from a court of equity. There are, for example, not many duties more firmly rooted in our nature than that of charity; and, upon that account, a court of equity will naturally be tempted to interpoſe in its behalf. But the extent of this duty depends on ſuch a variety of circumſtances, that the wiſeſt heads would in vain labour to bring it under general rules: to truſt, therefore, with any court a power to direct the charity of individuals, is a remedy which to ſociety would be more hurtful than the diſeaſe; for inſtead of inforcing this duty in any regular manner, it would open a wide door to legal tyranny and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Viewing the matter in this light, it will appear, that ſuch duties are left upon conſcience, not from neglect or inſenſibility, but from the difficulty of a proper remedy. And when ſuch duties can be brought under a general rule, I except not even gratitude, though in the main little ſuſceptible of circumſcription, we ſhall ſee afterward, that a court of equity declines not to interpoſe.</p>
               <p>In this work will be found ſeveral inſtances where equity and utility are in oppoſition; and when that happens, the queſtion is, Which of them ought to prevail? Equity, when it regards the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a few individuals only, ought to yield to utility when it regards the whole ſociety. It is for that very reaſon that a court of equity is bound to form its decrees upon general rules; for this meaſure regards the whole ſociety by preventing arbitrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0743600300:57"/>
It is commonly obſerved, that equitable rights are leſs ſteady and permanent than thoſe of common law: the reaſon will appear from what follows. A right is permanent or fluctuating, according to the circumſtances upon which it is founded: while theſe remain the ſame, ſo doth the right; when theſe vary, the right varies with them: this is applicable to both kinds equally. But here lies the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The circumſtances that found a right at common law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always few and weighty, are not variable, nor eaſily changed: a bond of borrowed money, for example, muſt ſubſiſt till it be paid. A claim in equity, on the contrary, ſeldom ariſes without a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of circumſtances, which make it leſs ſteady; for if but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle circumſtance be withdrawn, the claim is no more. Let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for example, that an infeftment of annualrent is aſſigned to a creditor for his ſecurity; the creditor or aſſignee thus ſecured, ought to draw his payment out of the intereſt before touching the capital; which is an equitable rule, becauſe it is favourable to the aſſignor or cedent, without hurting the aſſignee. But if the cedent have another creditor who arreſts the intereſt, the equitable rule now mentioned ceaſes, and gives place to another; which is, that the aſſignee ought to draw his payment out of the capital, leaving the intereſt to be drawn by the arreſter. Let us next ſuppoſe, that the cedent hath a third creditor, who after the arreſtment adjudges the capital. This new circumſtance varies again the rule of equity: for though the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent's intereſt weighs not in oppoſition to that of his creditor arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the adjudging creditor and the arreſter are upon a level as to every equitable conſideration; and upon that account, the aſſignee, who is the preferable or catholic creditor, ought to deal impartially between them: if he chuſe not to take his payment out of both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects proportionally, but only out of the capital, or out of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he ought to make an aſſignment to the poſtponed creditor, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to redreſs the inequality; and if he refuſe to do this act of juſtice, a court of equity will interpoſe.</p>
               <p>This example ſhows the mutability of equitable claims: but there is a cauſe which makes them appear ſtill more mutable than they are in reality. The ſtrongeſt notion is entertained of the ſtability of a right of property; becauſe no man can be deprived of his property but by his own deed. A claim of debt is underſtood to be ſtable, but in an inferior degree; becauſe payment puts an end to it without the will of the creditor. But equitable rights, which commonly accrue to a man without any deed of his, are often loſt in the ſame manner: and they will naturally be deemed tranſitory and fluctuating, when
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0743600300:58"/>
they depend ſo little on the will of the perſons who are poſſeſſed of them.</p>
               <p>In England, where the courts of equity and common law are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, the boundary betwixt equity and common law, where the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature doth not interpoſe, will remain always the ſame. But in Scotland, and other countries where equity and common law are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one court, the boundary varies imperceptibly; for what origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally is a rule in equity, loſes its character when, gathering ſtrength by practice, it is conſidered as common law: thus the <hi>actio negotiorum geſtorum,</hi> retention, ſalvage, &amp;c. are in Scotland ſcarce now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as depending on principles of equity. But by the cultivation of ſociety, and practice of law, nicer and nicer caſes in equity being daily unfolded, our notions of equity are preſerved alive; and the additions made to that fund, ſupply what is withdrawn from it, and transferred to common law.</p>
               <p>What is now ſaid ſuggeſts a queſtion, not leſs intricate than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether common law and equity ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſame or to different courts? The profound Bacon gives his opinion in the following words: <q rend="inline">"Apud nonnullos receptum eſt, ut juriſdictio, quae decernit ſecundum aequum et bonum, atque illa altera, quae procedit ſecundum jus ſtrictum, iiſdem curiis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putentur: apud alios autem, ut diverſis: omnino placet curiarum ſeparatio. Neque enim ſervabitur diſtinctio caſuum, ſi fiat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtio juriſdictionum: ſed arbitrium legem tandem trahet <note n="*" place="bottom">De aug. ſcient. l. 8. cap. 3. aph. 45.</note>."</q> Of all queſtions thoſe which concern the conſtitution of a ſtate, and its police, being the moſt involved in circumſtances, are, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the moſt difficult to be brought under preciſe principles. I pretend not to deliver any opinion on this point; and feeling in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a bias againſt the great authority mentioned, I ſcarce venture to form an opinion. It may be not improper, however, to hazard a few obſervations preparatory to a more accurate diſcuſſion. I am thoroughly ſenſible of the weight of the argument uſed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going citation. In the ſcience of juriſprudence, it is undoubtedly of great importance, that the boundary between equity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law be clearly aſcertained; without which we ſhall in vain hope for juſt deciſions. A judge who is uncertain, whether the caſe belong to equity or to common law, cannot have a clear concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what judgment ought to be pronounced: but a court that judges of both, being relieved from determining this preliminary point, will be apt to loſe ſight altogether of the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0743600300:59"/>
common law and equity. On the other hand, may it not be urged, that the dividing among different courts things intimately connected, bears hard upon every man who has a claim to proſecute? Before bringing his action, he muſt at his peril determine an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme nice point, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the caſe be governed by common law, or by equity. An error in this preliminary point, though not fatal to the cauſe, becauſe a remedy is provided, is, however, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of much trouble and expence. Nor is the moſt profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of law ſufficient altogether to prevent this evil; becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always be foreſeen what plea will be put in for the defendant, whether a plea in equity or at common law. In the next place, to us in Scotland it appears in ſome degree abſurd, to find a court ſo conſtituted, that in many caſes an iniquitous judgment muſt be the reſult. This not only happens frequently with reſpect to covenants, as above mentioned, but will always happen where a claim founded on common law, which muſt be brought before a court of common law, is oppoſed by an equitable defence which cannot be regarded by ſuch a court. Weighing theſe different arguments with ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the preponderancy ſeems to be on the ſide of an united juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The ſole inconvenience of an united juriſdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that it tends to blend common law with equity, may admit a remedy, by an inſtitute diſtinguiſhing, with accuracy, their boundaries: but the inconvenience of a divided juriſdiction admits not any effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Theſe hints, at the ſame time, are ſuggeſted with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diffidence; for I cannot be ignorant of the bias that naturally is produced by cuſtom and eſtabliſhed practice.</p>
               <p>In Scotland, as well as in other civilized countries, the King's council was originally the only court that had power to remedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects or redreſs injuſtice, in common law. To this extraordinary power the court of ſeſſion naturally ſucceeded, as being the ſupreme court in civil matters; for in every well-regulated ſociety, ſome one court muſt be truſted with this power, and no court more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than that which is ſupreme. It may at firſt ſight appear ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that no mention is made of this extraordinary power in any of the regulations concerning the court of ſeſſion. Probably the thing was not intended nor thought of: the neceſſity, however, of ſuch a power brought it in time to an eſtabliſhment. That the court itſelf had at firſt no notion of being poſſeſſed of this privilege, is evident from the act of ſederunt November 27. 1592, declaring, <q rend="inline">"That in time coming they will judge and decide upon clauſes irritant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in contracts, tacks, infeftments, bonds, and obligations,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0743600300:60"/>
preciſely according to the words and meaning of the ſame;"</q> which in effect was declaring themſelves a court of common law, not of equity. But the miſtake was ſoon diſcovered: the act of ſederunt wore out of uſe; and now for more than a century, the court of ſeſſion hath acted as a court of equity, as well as of common law. Nor is it rare to find powers unfolded in practice that were not in view at the inſtitution of a court. When the Roman Pretor was created to be the ſupreme judge, in place of the conſuls, there is no appearance that any inſtructions were given him concerning matters of equity. And even as to the Engliſh court of chancery, though originally a court of equity, there was not at firſt the leaſt notion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of that extenſive juriſdiction to which in later times it hath juſtly arrived.</p>
               <p>In Scotland, the union of common law with equity in the ſupreme court, appears to have had an influence upon inferior courts, and to have regulated their powers with reſpect to equity. The rule in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is, That inferior courts are confined to common law: and hence it is that an action founded merely upon equity, ſuch as a reduction upon minority and leſion, upon fraud, &amp;c. is not competent before an inferior court. But if againſt a proceſs founded on common law, an equitable defence be proponed, it is the practice of inferior courts to judge of ſuch defence. Imitation of the ſupreme court, which judges both of law and equity, ſupported by the inconvenience of removing to another court a proceſs that has perhaps long depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, paved the way to this enlargement of power. Another thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken notice of, tends to enlarge the powers of our inferior courts more and more; which is, that many actions, founded origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally on equity, have, by long practice, obtained an eſtabliſhment ſo firm as to be reckoned branches of the common law. This is the caſe of the <hi>actio negotiorum geſtorum,</hi> of recompence, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which, for that reaſon, are now commonly ſuſtained in infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior courts.</p>
               <p>Our courts of equity have advanced far in ſeconding the laws of nature, but have not perfected their courſe. Every clear and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable duty is countenanced with an action; but many of the more refined duties, as will be ſeen afterward, are left ſtill without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Until men, thoroughly humanized, be generally agreed about theſe more refined duties, it is perhaps the more prudent meaſure for a court of equity to leave them upon conſcience. Neither doth this court profeſs to take under its protection every covenant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Many engagements of various ſorts, the fruits of idleneſs,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0743600300:61"/>
without relation to what may be called buſineſs, are too trifling, or too ludicrous, to merit the countenance of law: a court, whether of common law or of equity, cannot preſerve its dignity if it deſcend to ſuch matters. Wagers of all ſorts, whether upon horſes, cocks, or accidental events, are of this ſort. People may amuſe themſelves, and men of eaſy fortunes may paſs their whole time in diverſion, becauſe there is no law againſt it; but ſuch paſtime, contrary to its nature, ought not to be converted into a ſerious matter, by bringing the fruits of it into a court of juſtice. This doctrine ſeems not to have been thoroughly underſtood, when the court of ſeſſion, in a caſe reported by Dirleton, ſuſtained action upon what is called there a <hi>ſponſio ludicra.</hi> A man having taken a piece of gold, under condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pay back a greater ſum in caſe he ſhould ever be married, was after his marriage ſued for performance. The court ſuſtained pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; though ſeveral of the judges were of opinion, that <hi>ſponſiones lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrae</hi> ought not to be authoriſed <note n="*" place="bottom">February 9. 1676.</note>. But in the following remarkable caſe, the court judged better. In the year 1698, a bond was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted of the following tenor: <q rend="inline">"I Mr William Cochran of Kilmaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock, for a certain ſum of money delivered to me by Mr John Stewart younger of Blackhall, bind and oblige me, my heirs and ſucceſſors, to deliver to the ſaid Mr John Stewart, his heirs execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and aſſignees, the ſum of one hundred guineas in gold, and that ſo ſoon as I, or the heirs deſcending of my body, ſhall ſucceed to the dignity and eſtate of Dundonald."</q> This ſum being claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the heir of the obligor, now become Earl of Dundonald, it was objected, That this being a <hi>ſponſio ludicra</hi> ought not to be countenanced with an action. It was anſwered, That bargains like the preſent are not againſt law; for if purchaſing the hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from a remote heir be lawful <note n="†" place="bottom">See Fountainhall, July 29. 1708, Rag <hi>contra</hi> Brown.</note>, it cannot be unlawful to give him a ſum on condition of receiving a greater when he ſhall ſucceed. If an heir pinched for money procure it upon diſadvantageous terms, equity, it is true, will relieve him: but in the preſent caſe there is no evidence, nor indeed ſuſpicion, of inequality. It was replied, That judges of equity muſt act by a general rule, and muſt either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn by the lump ſuch ludicrous bargains, or approve them by the lump: if they be indulged where they appear to be fair and equal, they muſt be indulged whatever their circumſtances be; becauſe no preciſe boundary can be fixed betwixt that degree of inequality which is permitted, and that which is condemned. In the next

place, it tends not to the good of ſociety to ſuſtain action upon ſuch bargains: they do not advance commerce, nor contribute in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the comforts of life; why then ſhould a court be bound to ſupport them? It is ſufficient that they are not reprobated, but left upon conſcience and private faith. The court refuſed to ſuſtain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; reſerving it to be conſidered, whether the purſuer, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the extent of the ſum given by him, be intitled to demand it back <note n="*" place="bottom">Feb. 7. 1753.

               <p>The multiplied combinations of individuals in ſociety ſuggeſt rules of equity ſo numerous and various, that in vain would any writer think of collecting all of them. From an undertaking which is in a good meaſure new, all that can be expected is a collection of ſome of the capital caſes that occur the moſt frequently in law-proceedings. This collection will comprehend many rules of equity, ſome of them probably of the moſt extenſive application. Nor will it be without profit, even as to ſubjects omitted; for by diligently obſerving the application of equitable principles to a number of leading caſes, a habit is gradually formed of reaſoning correctly upon matters of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which will enable us to apply the ſame principles to new caſes as they occur.</p>
               <p>The author having thus given a general view of his ſubject, ſhall finiſh with explaining his motive for appearing in public. Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing lawyers, to whom the ſubject muſt already be familiar, require no inſtruction. This treatiſe is dedicated to the ſtudious in general, ſuch as are fond to improve their minds by every exerciſe of the rational faculties. Writers upon law are too much confined in their views: their works, calculated for lawyers only, are involved in a cloud of obſcure words and terms of art, a language perfectly unknown except to thoſe of the profeſſion. Thus it happens, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of law, like the hidden myſteries of ſome ancient deity, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to its votaries; as if others were in duty bound to blind and implicit ſubmiſſion. But ſuch ſuperſtition, whatever unhappy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs it may have made in religion, never can prevail in law: men who have life or fortune at ſtake, take the liberty to think for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and are not leſs ready to accuſe judges for legal oppreſſion, than others for private violence or wrong. Ignorance of law hath in this reſpect a moſt unhappy effect: we all regard with partiality our own intereſt; and it requires knowledge not leſs than candour, to reſiſt the thought of being treated unjuſtly when a court pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth againſt us. Thus peeviſhneſs and diſcontent ariſe, and are vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

againſt the judges of the land. This, in a free government, is a dangerous and infectious ſpirit, to remedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we cannot be too ſolicitous. Knowledge of thoſe rational principles upon which law is founded I venture to ſuggeſt, as a remedy not leſs efficacious than palatable. Were ſuch knowledge univerſally ſpread, judges who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to rational principles, and who, with ſuperior underſtanding, can reconcile law to common ſenſe, would be revered by the whole ſociety. The fame of their integrity, ſupported by men of parts and reading, would deſcend to the loweſt of the people; a thing devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wiſhed! Nothing tends more to ſweeten the temper, than a conviction of impartiality in judges; by which we hold ourſelves ſecure againſt every inſult or wrong. By this means, peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in ſociety are promoted, and individuals are finely diſciplined to ſubmit with equal deference to all other acts of legal authority. Integrity is not the only duty required in a judge: to behave ſo as to make every one rely upon his integrity, is a duty not leſs eſſential. Deeply impreſſed with theſe notions, the author dedicates his work to every lover of ſcience; and hath endeavoured to explain his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a manner that requires in the reader no peculiar knowledge of municipal law. In that view he hath avoided terms of art; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with a ſcrupulous nicety, which might look like affectation, but ſo, he hopes, as that with the help of a law-dictionary, what he ſays may eaſily be apprehended.</p>
               <p>ORDER, a beauty in every compoſition, is eſſential in a treatiſe of equity, which comprehends an endleſs variety of matter. To avoid obſcurity and confuſion, we muſt, with the ſtricteſt accuracy, bring under one view things intimately connected, and handle ſeparately things unconnected, or but ſlightly connected. Two great princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, juſtice and utility, govern the proceedings of a court of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and every matter that belongs to that court, is regulated by one or other of theſe principles. Hence a diviſion of the preſent work into two books, the firſt appropriated to juſtice, the ſecond to utility. I propoſe a third book for certain ſubjects, which conſiſt of parts too intimately connected to bear a ſeparation; each of which is handled as one entire whole, inſtead of being broken into parts, and handled ſeparately for illuſtrating one or other principle, as is done in the two firſt books.</p>

               <p>IN the introduction occaſion was taken to ſhow, that a court of equity is neceſſary, firſt, to ſupply the defects of common law, and, next, to correct its rigour or injuſtice. The neceſſity in the former caſe is manifeſt from a principle, That where there is a right it ought to be made effectual; in the latter from another principle, That for every wrong there ought to be a remedy. In both the diſpute generally turns upon pecuniary intereſt. But there is a legal intereſt which is not pecuniary; and which, for the ſake of perſpicuity, ought to be handled ſeparately. In this view, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent book is divided into two parts. In the firſt are treated, the powers of a court of equity to ſupply defects and to correct inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the common law, with reſpect to pecuniary intereſt: and in the ſecond, the powers of a court of equity with reſpect to matters of juſtice that are not pecuniary.</p>

               <p>THE imperfections of common law are ſo many and ſo various, that it will be difficult to bring them into any perfect order. The following arrangement, if not the beſt, ſeems at leaſt to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and eaſy.

                  <p>THE ſocial ſtate, however diſireable, could never have taken place among men, were they not reſtrained by a moral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from injuring thoſe of their own ſpecies. To abſtain from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring others, is accordingly the primary law of ſociety, inforced by the moſt vigorous ſanctions: every culpable tranſgreſſion of that law ſubjects the wrong-doer to reparation; and every intentional tranſgreſſion ſubjects him, not only to reparation, but alſo to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0743600300:66"/>
The moral principle of abſtaining from injuring others, naturally takes the lead in every inſtitute of law; and as the inforcing that principle has been a capital object in eſtabliſhing courts of juſtice, it is proper to commence a treatiſe of equity with examining in what caſes the interpoſition of a court of equity is required to make it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; which can only be where no remedy is provided at common law.</p>
                  <p>The ways are endleſs by which men may be hurt in their perſons and in their property; but it is ſuppoſed, that there are very few caſes but what may be brought under one or other of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing claſſes. Firſt, Harm done in proſecuting one's own right or privilege. Second, Harm done without intending to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any right or privilege. Third, Undue influence employ'd for tempting or overawing others to ſacrifice knowingly their own intereſt. Fourth, Fraud, deceit, or other artificial means, employ'd to make others act unknowingly againſt their intereſt.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>SECTION I. Harm done by a man in proſecuting a right or privilege.</head>
                     <p>THE ſocial ſtate, which, on the one hand, is highly beneficial by the opportunity it affords for mutual aid and ſupport, is, on the other, attended with ſome inconveniencies, as in thoſe particular caſes where a man cannot have the free exerciſe of a right or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege without harming others. How far ſuch exerciſe may be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the law of our nature, is a queſtion of nice diſcuſſion. That men are born in a ſtate of freedom and independency, is an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth; but whether that freedom and independency may not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſome limitation from the colliſion of oppoſite rights and privileges, deſerves to be examined. If the free exerciſe of my rights be indulged me without regarding the harm that may enſue to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that other is ſo far under my power, and his intereſt ſo far ſubjected to mine. On the other ſide, if I be reſtrained from the exerciſe of my rights and privileges in every caſe where harm may enſue to another, I am ſo far dependent upon that other, and my intereſt ſo far ſubjected to his. Here is a threatening appearance for civil ſociety, that ſeems to admit no reſource but force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Caſes there certainly are that admit no other reſource; as where in a ſhipwreck two perſons lay hold of the ſame plank, one
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0743600300:67"/>
of whom muſt be thruſt off that both may not go to the bottom. But upon the preſent ſuppoſition, we are not reduced to that deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dilemma; for nature has temper'd theſe oppoſite intereſts by a rule not leſs beautiful than ſalutary. This rule conſiſts of two branches: the firſt is, That even the proſecution of my own right will not juſtify me in doing any action that directly harms another; and ſo far my intereſt yields to his: the ſecond is, That in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my right I am not concerned with any indirect or conſequential damage that another may ſuffer; and ſo far the intereſt of others yields to mine: I am ſorry if my neighbour happen thus to ſuffer; but I feel no check of conſcience on that account. The firſt branch reſolves into a principle inculcated in the preliminary diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That no intereſt of mine, not even the preſervation of life itſelf, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſes me to do any miſchief to an innocent perſon. The other branch is founded on expediency in oppoſition to juſtice; for if the poſſibility of harming others, whether foreſeen or not foreſeen, were ſufficient to reſtrain me from proſecuting my own rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, men would be too much cramped in action, or rather would be reduced to a ſtate of abſolute inactivity.</p>
                     <p>This rule, which is far from being ſimple or obvious in its applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, requires the illuſtration of various examples. I begin with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the firſt branch. However profitable it may be to purge my ſuperior field of water, yet it is univerſally admitted, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not legally open a new paſſage for it into my neighbour's ground; becauſe this is a direct damage to him: <q rend="inline">"Sic enim debere quem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorem agrum ſuum facere ne vicini deteriorem faciat <note n="*" place="bottom">De aqua, et aquae pluv. l. 1. § 4.</note>."</q> Where a river is interjected between my property and that of my neighbour, it is not lawful for me to alter its natural courſe, whether by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upon my neighbour's ground, or by depriving him of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe acts, both of them, are direct incroachments upon my neighbour's property. Neratius puts the caſe of a lake which in a rainy ſeaſon overflows the neighbouring grounds, to prevent which on one ſide a bulwark is erected. And he gives his opinion, that if this bulwark have the effect, in a rainy ſeaſon, to throw a greater quantity of water than uſual upon the oppoſite grounds, it ought to be demoliſhed <note n="†" place="bottom">De aqua, et aquae pluv. l. 1. § 2.</note>. This opinion is undoubtedly well founded at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law; becauſe by the ſuppoſition the bulwark is directly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the neighbouring proprietor. But this rule ſtrictly followed would bar many improvements; and for that reaſon there is room for the interpoſition of a court of equity to mitigate the common law
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0743600300:68"/>
upon the principle of utility. It will indulge me to raiſe a fence within my own property, to prevent my ground from being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlow'd by a river when in flood, or by a lake: if this work tend at times to throw a greater weight of water upon my neighbour, he may fence his ground as I did.</p>
                     <p>The foregoing examples, being all of the ſame kind, are governed by a practical rule, That we muſt not throw any thing into our neighbour's ground, <hi>Ne immittas in alienum,</hi> as expreſſed in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man law. But the principle goes a great way further, obliging us to abſtain from every operation that has directly the effect to make our neighbour's property uſeleſs or incomfortable to him. <q rend="inline">"It ſeems the better opinion, that a brew-houſe, glaſs-houſe, chandler's ſhop, or ſtie for ſwine, ſet up in ſuch inconvenient parts of a town that they cannot but greatly incommode the neighbourhood, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nuiſances <note n="*" place="bottom">A new abridgement of the law, vol. 3. p. 686.</note>."</q> Neighbours in a town muſt ſubmit to inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences from each other; but they muſt be protected from extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſturbances that render their property in a great meaſure uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to them. Upon this principle the court was of opinion, that the working in the upper ſtory of a large tenement with weighty ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers upon an anvil, is a nuiſance; and it was decreed that the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith ſhould remove at the next term <note n="†" place="bottom">Kinloch of Gilmerton againſt Robertſon, Dec. 9. 1756.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the ſecond branch of the rule: It is agreed by all, that where my property lies upon the ſide of a river that is gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon me, I may fence my bank in order to prevent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incroachments; for this work does not tend to produce even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct or conſequential damage: all the effect it can operate is, to prevent my neighbour from gaining ground on his ſide. A much narrower caſe is determined in the Roman law, That I may lawfully dig a pit in my own land for gathering water to my cattle, though it happens to intercept a ſpring that run under ground into my neighbour's field, and furniſhed him with water <note n="‡" place="bottom">De aqua, et aquae pluv. l. 1. § 12.</note>. For in this caſe the loſs to my neighbour is conſequential only by intercepting a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from him. For the ſame reaſon, I may build a houſe upon my march though it intercept the light from my neighbour's houſe; and a dry ſummer will not reſtrain me from the accuſtomed uſe of a rill running through my ground, though it may bring it ſo low as to be of no ſervice to my neighbour.</p>
                     <p>But with regard to this branch of the rule, there is a limitation
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0743600300:69"/>
founded entirely upon equity; which is, That however lawful it may be for a man to exerciſe his right for his own benefit where the harm that enſues is only conſequential; yet that the exerciſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful if it be done intentionally to diſtreſs others, without any view of benefiting himſelf. Rights and privileges are beſtow'd on us for our own good; but by no means for hurting our neighbours. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolence is condemned by all laws, natural and municipal: a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent act of the kind mentioned is condemned by the actor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his ſedate moments; and he finds himſelf in conſcience bound to repair the miſchief he has thus done. The common law, it is true, overlooks intention, conſidering the act in no other view but as a legal exerciſe of a right. But equity holds intention to be the capital part, being that which determines an action to be right or wrong; and affords reparation accordingly. Hence a general rule in equity, That juſtice will not permit a man to exerciſe his right where his intention is ſolely to hurt another; which in law-language is termed the acting <hi>in aemulationem vicini.</hi> In all caſes of this nature, a court of equity will give redreſs by voiding the act, if that can be done; otherwiſe by awarding a ſum in name of damages. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examples.</p>
                     <p>A man may lawfully dig a pit in his own field in order to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a vein of water that runs below the ſurface into his neighbour's property, provided his purpoſe be to have water for his own uſe: but if his purpoſe be to hurt his neighbour without any view to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit himſelf, the act is unlawful, as proceeding from a malevolent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and a court of equity will reſtrain him from this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="*" place="bottom">De aqua, et aquae pluv l 1. § 12.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Upon the ſame principle is founded the noted practice, in a court of equity, of refuſing to ſuſtain an action at law unleſs the plaintiff can ſhow an intereſt; for if he can take no benefit by the action, the preſumption muſt be, that it is calculated to diſtreſs the defendant, and done <hi>in aemulationem vicini.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In order to eſtabliſh the <hi>jus crediti</hi> in an aſſignee, and totally to diveſt the cedent or aſſignor, the law of Scotland requires, that notification of the aſſignment be made to the debtor, verified by an inſtrument under the hand of a notary termed <hi>an intimation.</hi> Before intimation the legal right is in the cedent, and the aſſignee has a claim in equity only. In this caſe, payment made to the cedent by the debtor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the aſſignment, is in all reſpects the ſame as if there were no aſſignment: it is payment made to the creditor, which, in law, muſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0743600300:70"/>
extinguiſh the debt. But what if the debtor, when he makes pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the cedent before intimation, be in the knowledge of the aſſignment? The common law knows no creditor but him who is legally veſted in the right; and therefore, diſregarding the debtor's knowledge of the aſſignment, it will ſuſtain the payment made to the cedent as made to the legal creditor. But equity teaches a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent doctrine. It was wrong in the cedent to take payment after he convey'd his right to the aſſignee: and though the debtor was only exerciſing his own right in making payment to the cedent, who is ſtill the creditor; yet being in the knowledge of the aſſignment, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt have been made intentionally to diſtreſs the aſſignee, without benefiting himſelf. A court of equity, therefore, correcting the injuſtice of common law, will hold as nothing the payment wrongouſly made to the cedent, and will oblige the debtor to make payment to the aſſignee.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to this matter, there is a wide difference between the ſolemnities that may be requiſite for veſting in an aſſignee a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete right to the ſubject, and what are ſufficient to bar the debtor from making payment to the cedent. In the former view, a regular intimation in neceſſary, or ſome ſolemn act equivalent to a regular intimation, a proceſs for example. In the latter view, the private knowledge of the debtor is ſufficient; and hence it is, that a promiſe of payment made to the aſſignee, though not equivalent to a regular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, is yet ſufficient to bar the debtor from making payment to the cedent. The court went farther: they were of opinion, that the aſſignee having ſhown his aſſignment to the debtor, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intimating the ſame by a notary, the debtor was thereby put <hi>in mala fide,</hi> and could not thereafter make payment to the cedent <note n="*" place="bottom">Fountainhall, February 16. 1703, Leith contra Garden.</note>. But hiſtorical knowledge of an aſſignment, where it falls ſhort of ocular evidence, will ſcarce be ſuſtained to put the debtor <hi>in mala ſide.</hi> And this rule is founded on utility: a debtor ought not to be furniſhed with pretexts againſt payment; and if private conviction of an aſſignment, without certain knowledge, were ſufficient, private conviction would often be affected, to gain time, and to delay pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>IN tracing the hiſtory of courts of law with reſpect to this branch, one beforehand would conjecture, that common law ſhould regard no acts injuring others in their rights and privileges, but where miſchief is intended; neglecting acts that are culpable only, as having a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation too ſlight for that law. But upon examination we diſcover a very different plan; ſo different as that damage occaſioned even by the ſlighteſt fault is, and always was repaired in courts of common law. Nor ought we to be ſurpriſed at this extenſion of common law, which was no ſubtile refinement, but rather the contrary. In the criminal law, very little diſtinction was originally made between a criminal and a culpable act, even with reſpect to puniſhment <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 1.</note>, not to talk of reparation. And this practice, ſo groſs in reality as well as in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, was conformable to the manners of thoſe times; the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of reſentment, in a fierce and lawleſs people, being rouſed by the ſlighteſt harm, and being too violent for any deliberate diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between intentional and culpable wrongs. In fact, both were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſubjected to puniſhment, even after the power of puniſhment was transferred to the magiſtrate. And of this we have a notable example in the <hi>lex Aquilia</hi> among the Romans: <q rend="inline">"Qui ſervum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienum, quadrupedem aut pecudem, injuria occiderit; quanti id in eo anno plurimi fuit, tantum aes dare domino damnas eſto <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 2. p. ad. leg. Aquil.</note>."</q> Here the word <hi>injuria</hi> is interpreted, <q rend="inline">"quod non jure factum eſt; i. e. ſi culpa quis occiderit <note n="‡" place="bottom">l. 5. § 1. ad. leg. Aquil.</note>."</q> The retroſpect here may happen to be a great puniſhment; for the obliging a man who kills a lame horſe not worth fifty ſhillings, to pay fifty pounds becauſe the horſe was of that value ſome months before, is evidently a puniſhment. And as even a <hi>culpa leviſſima</hi> ſubjects a man to the <hi>lex Aquilia</hi> 
                        <note n="‖" place="bottom">l. 44. cod.</note>, it is clear that the ſlighteſt fault by which damage enſues is puniſhable by that law. The <hi>lex Aquilia</hi> was accordingly held by all to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and for that reaſon no action upon it was ſuſtained againſt the heir <note n="**" place="bottom">l. 23. § 8. ad. leg. Aquil.</note>. The only thing ſupriſing is, to find this law continuing in force, without alteration or improvement, down to the reign of the Emperor Juſtinian. The Roman law was cultivated by men of the

greateſt genius, and was celebrated all over the world for its equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deciſions: is it not amazing, that in an enlightened age ſuch groſs injuſtice ſhould prevail, as to make even the ſlighteſt fault a ground for puniſhment?</p>
                     <p>When ſuch was the common law of the Romans with regard to puniſhment, there can be no difficulty to aſſign a reaſon why that law was extended to reparation even for the ſlighteſt fault; and as little, to aſſign a reaſon why the ſame obtains in the common law of moſt European nations, the principles of which are borrowed from the Roman law. The penal branch, it is true, of wrongs that are culpable only, and not criminal, has been long aboliſhed; having given way to the gradual improvement of the moral ſenſe, which dictates, that where there is no intention to do miſchief, there ought to be no puniſhment; and that the perſon who is hurt by a fault on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not by a crime, cannot juſtly demand more than reparation. And as this is the preſent practice of all civilized nations, it is clear that the reparation of damage occaſioned by acts of violence comes under courts of common law, which conſequently is ſo far a bar to a court of equity.</p>
                     <p>And conſidering, that regulations reſtraining individuals from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring others and compelling them to perform their engagements, compoſed originally the bulk of common law <note n="*" place="bottom">See Introduction.</note>, it will not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, that courts of common law took early under their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance every culpable act that occaſions miſchief; which was the more neceſſary, in reſpect that, puniſhment being laid aſide, reparation is the only mean left for repreſſing a culpable act. Thus we find ample proviſion made by common law, not only againſt intentional miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, but alſo againſt miſchief that is only foreſeen, not intended. And ſo far there is no occaſion for a court of equity.</p>
                     <p>But it is not ſufficient for the ſecurity of individuals in ſociety, that a man himſelf be prohibited from doing miſchief: he ought over and above to be careful and vigilant, that perſons, animals, and things, under his power, do no miſchief; and if he neglect this branch of his duty, he is liable to repair the miſchief that enſues, equally as if it had proceeded from his own act. 1ſt, With reſpect to ſervants, it is the maſter's buſineſs to make a right choice, and to keep them under proper diſcipline; and therefore, if they do any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that might have been foreſeen and prevented, he is liable. Thus, if a paſſenger be hurt by my ſervant's throwing a ſtone out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in my houſe, or have his cloaths ſullied by dirty water poured
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0743600300:73"/>
down upon him, the damage muſt be repaired by me at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; reſerving to me relief againſt my ſervant. But if a man be killed or wounded by my ſervant in a ſcuffle, I am not liable; unleſs it can be ſpecified, that I knew him to be quarrelſome, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently might have foreſeen the miſchief. 2d, With reſpect to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, it is the proprietor's duty to guard them from doing harm; and if harm enſue that might have been foreſeen, he is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the damage: as, for example, where he ſuffers his cattle to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in his neighbour's field; or where the miſchief is done by a beaſt of a vicious kind; or even by an ox or a horſe, which, contrary to its nature, he knows to be miſchievous <note n="*" place="bottom">Exodus, chap. xxi. 29. 36.</note>. 3d, As to things, it is alſo the duty of the proprietor to keep them from doing harm. Thus both fiar and liferenter were made liable to repair the miſchief occaſioned to a neighbouring tenement by the fall of their houſe <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, 16th February 1666, Kay contra Littlejohn.</note>. It is the duty of a man who carries ſtones in a waggon along the highway, to pack them neatly, in order to prevent harm; and if, by careleſs package, a ſtone drop out and bruiſe a paſſenger, the man is liable. But as to caſes of this kind, it is a good defence againſt a claim of reparation, that the claimant ſuffered by his own fault: <q rend="inline">"Si quis aliquem evitans, magiſtratum forte, in taberna proxima ſe immiſiſſet, ibique a cane feroce laeſus eſſet, non poſſe agi canis nomine quidam putant: at ſi ſolutus fuiſſet, contra <note n="‡" place="bottom">l. 2. § 1. Si quadrupes pauperiem ſeciſſe dicatur.</note>."</q> If a fierce bull of mine get looſe, and wound a perſon, I am liable: but if a man break down my fence, and is hurt by the bull in my incloſure, I am not liable; for, by an unlawful act, he himſelf was the occaſion of the hurt he ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>Thus, with reſpect to matters falling under the preſent ſection, it appears, that faults come under common law as well as crimes, and omiſſions as well as commiſſions; and therefore ſo far the common law appears complete, leaving no gleanings to a court of equity.</p>

                        <p>JEAN MACKIE, heireſs of Maidland, having diſponed ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of land lying about the town of Wigton, to perſons who were moſtly innkeepers there, a reduction was brought, upon the head of fraud and circumvention, by her ſiſter, next heir in virtue of a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It came out upon proof, 1ſt, That Jean Mackie was a habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual drunkard; that ſhe ſold her very cloaths to purchaſe drink, ſcarce leaving herſelf a rag to cover her nakedneſs; and that, by tempting her with a few ſhillings, it was in the power of any one to make her accept a bill for a large ſum, or to make her diſpone any part of her land. 2dly, That the diſpoſitions challenged were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for no adequate cauſe. The court accordingly voided theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions <note n="*" place="bottom">November 24. 1752, Mackie contra Maxwell, &amp;c.</note>. Upon this caſe it ought to be obſerved, that though fraud and circumvention were ſpecified as the foundation of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, which is a common but ſlovenly practice in proceſſes of that ſort; yet there was not the leaſt evidence, that Jean was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon or circumvened in any manner. Nor was there any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for recurring to ſuch artifice: a little drink, or a few ſhillings to purchaſe it, would have tempted her at any time, drunk or ſober, to diſpone any of her ſubjects. And ſhe herſelf, being called as a witneſs, deponed, that ſhe granted theſe diſpoſitions freely, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well what ſhe did. Where, then, lies the ground of reduction? Plainly here: It is undoubtedly an immoral act, to take advantage of weak perſons who are incapable to reſiſt certain temptations, thereby to ſtrip them of their goods. To juſtify ſuch an act, the conſent of the perſon injured can have no authority, more than the conſent of

                        <p>IF it be a moral wrong to tempt a weak man to act againſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, extortion is a wrong ſtill more flagrant, by its nearer approach to open violence. What, therefore, only remains upon this article, is to illuſtrate it by examples.</p>
                        <p>Every benefit taken indirectly by a creditor, for the granting of which no impulſive cauſe appears but the money lent, will be voided as extorted. Thus an aſſignment to a leaſe was voided, being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſame date with a bond of borrowed money, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have had no other cauſe <note n="*" place="bottom">Fountainhall, June 20. 1696, Sutherland contra Sinclair.</note>. At the time of granting an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable bond of corroboration, the debtor engaged himſelf by a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate writing, That in caſe he ſhould have occaſion to ſell the land, the creditor ſhould have it for a price named. The price appeared to be equal; and yet the paction was voided, as obtained by extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="†" place="bottom">November 30. 1736, Brown contra Muir.</note>. Upon the ſame ground, a bond for a ſum taken from the principal debtor by his cautioner, as a reward for lending his credit, was voided <note n="‡" place="bottom">Forbes 24, Fountainhall 27, January 1711, King contra Ker.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Rigorous creditors go ſometimes differently to work. If they dare not venture upon greater profit directly than is permitted by law, they aim at it indirectly, by ſtipulating ſevere irritancies upon failure of payment. One ſtipulation of that ſort which makes a great figure in our law, is, That if the ſum lent upon a wadſet or pledge be not repaid at the term covenanted, the property of the wadſet or pledge ſhall, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> be transferred to the creditor in ſatisfaction of the debt. It is that paction, which in the Roman law is named <hi>lex commiſſoria in pignoribus,</hi> and which in that law ſeems to be totally reprobated <note n="‖" place="bottom">l. ult. C. De pactis pignorum.</note>. With us it muſt be effectual at common law, becauſe there is no ſtatute againſt it. But then, as it is a hard and rigorous condition, extorted from a neceſſitous debtor, a court of equity will interpoſe to give relief. And this can be done by following a general rule that is applicable to all caſes of the kind; which is, to admit the debtor to redeem his pledge by payment, at any time, until a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor be brought by the creditor, ſignifying his will to hold the pledge
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0743600300:76"/>
in place of his money. This proceſs affords the debtor an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to purge his failure by payment; which is all that in fair dealing the creditor can demand. And thus the declarator ſerves a double purpoſe: it declares the creditor's option to take the land in place of his money; and it relieves the debtor from the hardſhip of a penal irritancy, by furniſhing him an opportunity to pay the debt.</p>
                        <p>Hence it follows, that the power of redeeming the wadſet or pledge belongs to the debtor, in all caſes, whether the bargain be lucrative or not. A declarator being neceſſary, the property cannot thereby be transferred to the creditor, unleſs the debtor decline to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his pledge: and this option he muſt have, whether the creditor have made profit or not by poſſeſſion of the pledge. Suppoſing a proper wadſet granted, by which the creditor makes more than the intereſt of his money; juſtice requires, that the debtor have a power to redeem even after the term limited, until the equity of redemption be forecloſed by a declarator; and if a declarator be neceſſary, as is proved, the debtor muſt have the ſame privilege, even where the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor has drawn leſs than his intereſt.</p>
                        <p>In equity, however, a material difference will be obſerved between a proper wadſet with a <hi>pactum legis commiſſoriae,</hi> and a proper wadſet where the term of redemption is not limited. In the latter caſe, the parties ſtand upon an equal footing: the creditor may demand his money when he pleaſes; and he has no claim for intereſt, becauſe of his agreement to accept the rents inſtead of intereſt: the debtor, on the other hand, may redeem his land when he pleaſes, upon repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſum borrowed, without being liable to any intereſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſaid agreement. But the matter turns out differently in equity, where the power of redemption is by paction limited to a certain term. There being no limitation upon the creditor, he may demand his money when he pleaſes; and he has no claim for intereſt, even though the rents have fallen ſhort of the intereſt. But if the debtor inſiſt upon the equity of redemption after the term to which the redemption is limited; he muſt, beſide repaying the ſum borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, make good the intereſt, ſo far as the rent of the land has proved deficient. For impartiality is eſſential to a court of equity: if the one party be relieved againſt the rigour of a covenant, the other has the ſame claim: after taking the land from the creditor contrary to paction, it would be groſs injuſtice to hold the paction good againſt him, by limiting him to leſs intereſt than he is intitled to by law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an ordinary loan <note n="*" place="bottom">To this caſe is applicable an Engliſh maxim of equity, <q rend="inline">"That he that demands equity muſt give equity."</q>
                           </note>.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0743600300:77"/>
From what is ſaid it will be clear, that a power of redeeming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a limited time annexed to a proper ſale for an adequate price, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be exerciſed after the term limited for the redemption is paſt. The purchaſer, to whom the property was transferred from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, has no occaſion for a declarator; nor doth equity require the time for redemption to be enlarged contrary to paction, in a caſe where an adequate price is given for the ſubject.</p>
                        <p>MANY other hard and oppreſſive conditions in bonds of borrowed money, invented by rigorous creditors for their own conveniency, without the leaſt regard to humanity or equity, were repreſſed by the act 140. parl. 1592. And, by the authority of that ſtatute, ſuch pactions may be brought under challenge in courts of common law, againſt which otherwiſe no remedy could be afforded except in a court of equity.</p>
                        <p>It was perhaps the ſtatute now mentioned which miſled the court of ſeſſion into an opinion, that it belongs to the legiſlature ſolely to repreſs ſuch rigorous conditions in agreements as are ſtated above. One thing is certain, that immediately after the ſtatute there is an act of ſederunt, November 27. 1592, in which the court declares, <q rend="inline">"That, in time coming, they will judge and decide upon clauſes irritant contained in contracts, tacks, infeftments, bonds, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, preciſely according to the words and meaning of the ſame."</q> Such a reſolution, proper for a court of common law, is inconſiſtent with the nature of a court of equity. The miſtake was ſoon diſcovered: the act of ſederunt wore out of obſervance; and now, for a long time, the court of ſeſſion has acted as a court of equity in this as well as in other matters.</p>
                        <p>IT is uſury by ſtatute to bargain with a debtor for more than the legal intereſt; but it is not uſury to take a proper wadſet, even where the rent of the land exceeds the intereſt of the money. For the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor who accepts the rent inſtead of intereſt, takes upon himſelf the inſolvency of the tenants; and the hazard of this inſolvency, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſmall, ſaves from uſury; which conſiſts in ſtipulating a yearly ſum certain above the legal intereſt. But though ſuch a bargain, where the rent exceeds the legal intereſt, is not, ſtrictly ſpeaking, uſury; it is rigorous and oppreſſive, and plainly ſpeaks out the want of credit in the perſon who ſubmits to it; upon which account, it might be thought a proper ſubject for equity, did we not reflect that all wadſets are not lucrative. When ſuch is the caſe, what ſhall be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0743600300:78"/>
the judge's conduct? Muſt he give an opinion upon every wadſet according to its peculiar circumſtances? or ought he to follow ſome rule that is applicable to all caſes of the kind? The former opens a door to arbitrary proceedings: the latter fettering a judge, forces him often to do what is materially unjuſt. Here equity, regarding individuals, weighs againſt utility, regarding the whole ſociety. The latter being by far the more weighty conſideration, muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate: and for that reaſon only are wadſets tolerated, even the moſt lucrative; for it is not ſafe to give any redreſs in equity.</p>
                        <p>This doctrine may be illuſtrated by a different caſe. A debtor ſtanding perſonally bound for payment of the legal intereſt, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to give an additional real ſecurity, by infefting the creditor in certain lands, the rent of which is paid in corn, with this proviſo, <q rend="inline">"That the creditor, if he chuſe to levy the rents for his payment, ſhall not be ſubjected to an account, but ſhall hold the rents in lieu of his intereſt."</q> This, from what is obſerved above, is not uſury; becauſe the value of the corn, however much above the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in common years, may poſſibly fall below it. But as the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor is in all events ſecure of his intereſt by having his debtor bound perſonally, and may often draw more than his intereſt by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying the rent when corn ſells high; equity will relieve againſt the inequality of this bargain. For here the court may follow a general rule, applicable to all caſes of the kind, affording a remedy equally complete in every ſingle caſe; which is, to oblige the creditor to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for every farthing he receives more than his intereſt, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the ſame into his capital. In the caſe of a proper wadſet this rule would be unjuſt, becauſe the creditor has a chance of getting leſs than his intereſt, which ought to be compenſated with ſome benefit beyond the ordinary profit of money: and if the door be once opened to an extraordinary benefit, a preciſe boundary cannot be aſcertained between more and leſs. But the covenant now mentioned is in its very conception oppreſſive; and the creditor may juſtly be deprived of the extraordinary benefit he draws from it, when he is, in all events, ſecure of the legal intereſt.</p>

                           <hi>Pacta contra ſidem tabularum nuptialium</hi> belong to this article. Such private pactions between the bridegroom and his father, contrary to the faith of the public treaty of marriage, are fraudulent as to the wife and children, who will be relieved upon the head of fraud.

In a contract of marriage the eſtate was ſettled upon the bridegroom by his father; and the bride's portion was taken payable to the father, which he accepted for ſatisfaction of the debts he owed, and for proviſions to his younger children.

S. and his heirs, upon conſideration of L. 30 paid him in money, and a ſecurity for L. 20 yearly during the joint lives of him and his father. Though the father lived ten years after this tranſaction, and though I. S. would have loſt his money had the heir died during his father's life, yet the heir was relieved againſt the conveyance <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. § 1.</note>. The plaintiff, a young man, who had a narrow allowance from his father on whoſe death a great eſtate was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to him in tail, having, in the year 1675, borrowed L. 1000 from the defendant, became bound, in caſe he ſurvived his father, to pay the defendant L. 5000 within a month after his father's death, with intereſt thereafter; but that, if he did not outlive his father, the money ſhould not be repaid. After the father's death, which happened <hi>anno</hi> 1679, the plaintiff brought his bill upon the head of fraud and extortion, to be relieved of this bargain, upon repayment of the ſum borrowed, with intereſt. The cauſe came firſt before the Lord Nottinghame, who decreed the bargain to be effectual. But, upon a re-hearing before Lord Chancellor Jeffreys, it was inſiſted, That the clauſe freeing the plaintiff from the debt if he died before his father, did not in reaſon difference the caſe from any other bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain made by an heir of entail, to be performed at the death of the tenant in tail; for in all ſuch caſes the debt is loſt of courſe, upon predeceaſe of the heir of entail; and therefore that this clauſe, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contrived to colour a bargain which to the defendant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt have appeared unconſcionable, was in reality a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance againſt him. Though in this caſe there was no proof of fraud, nor of any practice uſed to draw the plaintiff into the bargain; yet, becauſe of the unconſcionableneſs of the bargain, the plaintiff was relieved againſt it <note n="‡" place="bottom">2.

                     <head>SECT. IV. Fraud, deceit, or other artificial means, employ'd for making a man act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowingly againſt his intereſt.</head>
                     <p>IT is thought, that a court of common law ſeldom interpoſes in any of the caſes that come under the ſection immediately foregoing; and the reaſon is, that whether a man be led againſt his own intereſt by a violent temptation or by extortion, there is ſtill left to him in appearance a free choice. But with reſpect to the matters that belong to the preſent ſection, a man is led blindly againſt his own intereſt, and has no choice. This ſpecies of wrong, therefore, being more flagrant, is not neglected by courts of common law. It is according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down as a general rule in the Engliſh law, <q rend="inline">"That without the expreſs proviſion of any act of parliament, all deceitful practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in defrauding another of his known right, by means of ſome artful device, contrary to the plain rules of common honeſty, are condemned by the common law, and puniſhed according to the heinouſneſs of the offence <note n="†" place="bottom">New abridgement of the law, vol. 2. p. 594.</note>."</q> Thus the cauſing an illiterate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to execute a deed to his prejudice, by reading it to him in words different from thoſe in the deed, is a fraud, which a court of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law will redreſs, by ſetting the deed aſide.

                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0743600300:83"/>
In general, every covenant procured by fraud will be ſet aſide in a court of common law. But with regard to covenants or agreements diſregarded at common law, there can be no relief but in a court of equity. Thus a policy of inſurance was ſet aſide upon fraud by a bill in chancery <note n="*" place="bottom">2. Vernon 206.</note>.</p>
                     <p>We next proceed to inquire, whether every deceitful practice to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon others comes under common law. Fraud conſiſts in my perſuading a man who has confidence in me, to do an act as for his own intereſt, which I know will have the contrary effect. But in whatever manner a man be deceived or miſſed, yet if he was not deceived by relying upon the friendſhip and integrity of another, it is not a fraud. Fraud therefore implies treachery, without which no artifice nor double dealing can be termed <hi>fraud</hi> in a proper ſenſe. But there are double-fac'd circumſtances without number, and other artful means, calculated to deceive, which do not involve any degree of treachery: when a man ſuffers himſelf to be deceived by ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it muſt in ſome meaſure be his own fault, and byſtanders are more apt to make him the object of their ridicule than of their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for which reaſon frauds of this inferior nature have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked by common law. But as every attempt to deceive another to his prejudice is criminal in conſcience, it is the duty of a court of equity to repreſs ſuch deceit, by awarding reparation to the perſon who ſuffers. And utility pleads for reparation as well as equity; for if law were not attentive to repreſs deceit in its bud, corruption would gain ground, and even the groſſeſt frauds would become too ſtubborn for law. It is this ſpecies of deceit, excluding treachery, that Lord Coke probably had in his eye <note n="†" place="bottom">4. Inſt. 84.</note>, when he lays down the following doctrine, That all covins, frauds, and deceits, for which there is no remedy at common law, are and were always redreſſed in the court of chancery.</p>
                     <p>It is mentioned above, that a covenant procured by fraud will be ſet aſide in a court of common law; and I now give inſtances where a covenant procured by deceit that amounts not to fraud, is ſet aſide in a court of equity. A man having failed in his trade, compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his creditors at ſo much <hi>per</hi> pound, to be paid at a time cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Some of the creditors refuſing to fulfil the agreement, a bill was brought by the bankrupt to compel a ſpecific performance. But it appearing that he had underhand agreed with ſome of his creditors to pay their whole debts, in order that they might draw in the reſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0743600300:84"/>
to a compoſition, the court would not decree the agreement, but diſmiſſed the bill <note n="*" place="bottom">2. Vernon 71. Child contra Danbridge.</note>. A purchaſe made by a merchant in the courſe of commerce will be effectual, however ſoon his bankruptcy follow, provided it was his intention by continuing in trade to pay the price. But if he had bankruptcy in view, and no proſpect to pay the price, the bargain, brought about by a palpable cheat, will be reduced in a court of equity, and the ſubject be reſtored to the vender. The only thorny point is, to detect the <hi>animus</hi> of the purchaſer to defraud the vender. In the caſe of Joſeph Cave <note n="†" place="bottom">Dict. tit. Fraud.</note>, the preſumptive fraud was confined to three days before the <hi>ceſſio bonorum;</hi> but in that caſe Cave the purchaſer was in good credit, till he demanded a meeting of his creditors in order to ſurrender his effects to them. There may however be other circumſtances concurring with inſolvency to enlarge that period. Gilbert Barclay merchant in Cromarty was in labouring circumſtances, and owed much more than he was worth, when he made a purchaſe of ſalmon from Mackay of Bighouſe; and before delivery, ſeveral of his creditors proceeded to execution againſt him. In a few days after delivery he made over the ſalmon to William Forſyth, another merchant of the ſame town, in part pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a debt due to Forſyth; who was in the knowledge that Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay was in labouring circumſtances, and that the price of the ſalmon was not paid. Execution thickened more and more upon him, and he broke in ten days or a fortnight after the ſalmon was delivered to Forſyth. From theſe circumſtances the court preſumed an intention in Barclay to defraud Bighouſe: and conſidering that Forſyth's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe was not made <hi>bona fide,</hi> they found him liable to pay to Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe the value of the ſalmon <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mackay of Bighouſe contra William Forſyth merchant in Cromarty, January 20. 1758.</note>.</p>

This is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which equity diſcountenances; and therefore it was decreed, that the leſſee ſhould enjoy for the reſidue of the term that was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent at the father's death <note n="‖" place="bottom">Abridgement caſes in equity, cap. 47. ſect.

She obey'd; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſtood at the corner of the ſtreet to ſee them go along to be married. The plaintiff was relieved on the point of deceit. A man having agreed to be bound for certain proviſions in his ſon's contract of marriage, upon a promiſe from the ſon to diſcharge the ſame, which accordingly was done before the marriage; and after the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage money having been lent to the ſon, upon the faith of the ſaid proviſions in his contract; the diſcharge was ſet aſide at the inſtance of the creditors, as being a deceitful contrivance between father and ſon to entrap them <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, January 21. 1680, Caddel contra Raith.</note>.

The hurt thus done to the lender by putting him off with a lame ſecurity, was properly repaired by preferring him before the incumbrancer. The following caſes are of the ſame kind. A man lends his mortgage-deed to the mortgager, to enable him to borrow more money. The mortgagee being thus in combination with the mortgager to deceive the lender, is acceſſory to the fraud.

                     <head>SECT. V. Reparation to which perſons are intitled who are harmed in their rights or privileges.</head>
                     <p>IN order to clear what need there may be of a court of equity with reſpect to the ſubject under conſideration, it is proper to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that regulations for preventing harm cannot be other but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitory; and conſequently cannot afford opportunity for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of any court of law till the wrong be committed. To reſtore the party injured to his former ſituation, where that method is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, will be preferred as the moſt complete reparation. Thus goods ſtolen are reſtored to the owner; and a diſpoſition of land procured by fear, or undue influence, is voided, in order that the diſponer may be reſtored to his property. But it ſeldom happens that there is place for a remedy ſo complete: it holds commonly, as expreſſed in the Roman law, that <hi>factum infectum fieri nequit;</hi> and when that is the caſe, the perſon injured, inſtead of being reſtored to his former ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be contented with an equivalent in money.</p>
                     <p>The firſt queſtion that occurs upon this ſubject is, Whether, in a claim for reparation, conſequential damage can be ſtated. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential damage is ſometimes certain, ſometimes uncertain. A houſe of mine rented by a tenant, is unlawfully demoliſhed: the direct damage is the loſs of the houſe: the conſequential damage is the loſs of the rent; which in this caſe is certain, becauſe the unlawful act neceſſarily relieves the tenant from paying rent. Again, a man robs me of my horſe: the direct damage is the horſe loſt to me: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential damage is the being prevented from making profit by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0743600300:87"/>
him; which is not certain, becauſe the opportunity of making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit might have failed me, and poſſibly might have been neglected though it had offered. In the caſe firſt mentioned, the loſs of the rent, being certain, comes properly under the eſtimation of actual damage; and conſequently will never be excluded by a court of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law. But conſequential damage that is uncertain, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken into the account. And the reaſon follows: It is naturally incumbent upon the man who claims reparation, to prove the extent of the damage he has ſuſtained; which cannot be done with reſpect to conſequential damage, as far as uncertain. But as it is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly a prejudice to be deprived of profit that probably might have been made; the claimant is in equity relieved of this proof, where the direct damage is the effect of a criminal act: every preſumption is turned againſt the delinquent; and he is charged with every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable article of profit, unleſs he can give convincing evidence that the profit claimed could not have been made. And this is conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the rules of equity; for as the profits are rendered uncertain by a criminal act, the conſequences of this uncertainty ought to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the delinquent, and not his party who is innocent. Here is a fair opportunity for the interpoſition of equity. A court of common law cannot liſten to any proof but what is complete, and cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward damages except as far as rendered certain by evidence. A court of equity, with reſpect to criminal acts, turns the uncertainty againſt the delinquent; and by that means affords complete reparation to the perſon injured. Thus, in a ſpuilzie, which is a claim for dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in a civil court, founded on the violent abſtraction of moveable goods, the profit that might have been made by the cattle or horſes carried off, termed <hi>violent profits,</hi> makes always an article in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of damage. The rule is different where the damage is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by a culpable act only; for as there is nothing here to vary the rule of law, <hi>Quod affirmanti incumbit probatio,</hi> no article of profit will be ſuſtained but what can be rendered certain by evidence. This, it is true, may poſſibly be prejudicial to the perſon who is hurt by the culpable act: but <hi>humanum eſt errare;</hi> and it is more expedient that he ſuffer ſome prejudice, than that men ſhould be terrified from induſtry and activity, by a rigorous and vague claim <note n="a" place="bottom">In the Engliſh courts of common law there is no accurate diſtinction made between damage certain and uncertain. Damages are taxed by the jury, who give ſuch damages as in conſcience they think ſufficient to make up the loſs, without regarding any preciſe rule.</note>. This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine

Idemque et in venatoribus, et in aucupibus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandum."</q> The following inſtance is an apt illuſtration of this doctrine. The Duke of Argyle's right of admiralty reaches over the weſtern iſlands; on the coaſt of which a wrecked ſhip floating with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a living creature in it, was laid hold of and ſold by authority of the Duke's depute to one Robertſon, who refitted the ſhip at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable charge, and provided a crew to carry her to Clyde. Sir Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovick Grant, who had a deputation from the Admiral of Scotland, miſapprehending the bounds of his juriſdiction, gave orders for ſeizing the ſhip as his property; and theſe orders were put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the ſhip was refitted by Robertſon. As ſoon as the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take was diſcovered, the ſhip was redelivered. But Robertſon, who loſt conſiderably by the delay, brought a proceſs againſt Sir Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovick for damages, and obtained a decree<note n="†" place="bottom">December 21. 1756.</note> for a large ſum, to which the direct damage amounted. It was conſidered, that the defendant's error was culpable in acting raſhly without duly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the limits of his juriſdiction, of which he might be eaſily aſcertained by inſpecting the Duke's title on record. But as to the conſequential damage, <hi>viz.</hi> the profits Robertſon could have made by the ſhip, had he not been unjuſtly deprived of the poſſeſſion, which muſt be in a great meaſure uncertain, the court unanimouſly rejected this branch of the claim.</p>
                     <p>The next queſtion is, Whether in eſtimating damage there be ground in any caſe for admitting the <hi>pretium affectionis.</hi> Paulus anſwers, That there is not: <q rend="inline">"Si ſervum meum occidiſti, non affectiones aeſtimandas eſſe puto, (veluti ſi filium tuum naturalem quis occiderit, quem tu magno emptum velles), ſed quanti omnibus valeret.

                  <head>CHAP. II. Powers of a Court of Equity to remedy what is imperfect in common law, with reſpect to protecting the weak of mind from harming themſelves by unequal bargains and irrational deeds.</head>
                  <p>THE weakneſs and imbecillity of ſome men make them a fit prey for the crafty and deſigning. But as every deed, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or tranſaction, procured by undue influence, comes under the foregoing chapter, the preſent chapter is confined to caſes where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity protects individuals from hurting themſelves by their own weakneſs and imbecillity, without the intervention of any craft or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due influence. And here, though, for the ſake of commerce, utility will not liſten to a complaint of inequality among <hi>majores, ſcientes, et prudentes;</hi> yet the weak of mind ought to be excepted; becauſe ſuch perſons ought to be removed from commerce, and their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions be confined to what is ſtrictly neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence and well-being. And this is juſtly confining to the weak of mind a rule againſt inequality in bargains, which the Romans, ignorant of commerce, made general with reſpect to every perſon.</p>
                  <p>I begin with deeds granted by perſons under age, who cannot be ſuppoſed mature in judgement. A reduction upon the head of mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and leſion, unknown in the common law, is an action ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a court of equity for ſetting aſide any unequal tranſaction done
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0743600300:90"/>
during nonage. But inequality ought not to be regarded in a deed that proceeds from a virtuous and rational motive, which would be a laudable deed in one of full age. I give the following examples. A young man under age, having no means of his own, is aliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and educated by a near relation, till he happens to ſucceed to an opulent fortune. Full of gratitude, he grants to his benefactor a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneratory bond for a moderate ſum, and dies without arriving to full age. A court of equity will never give countenance to the heir in attempting to reduce this bond; for gratitude is a moral duty, and the young man was in conſcience bound to make a grateful return. A court of equity, it is true, has not many opportunities to inforce the duty of gratitude, becauſe it can ſeldom be brought under a general rule; but here a court of equity may ſafely interpoſe to ſupport a grateful return, the extent of which is aſcertained by the young man himſelf. I put another caſe. A man of an opulent fortune dies ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly without making proviſions for his younger children. His eldeſt ſon and heir ſupplies this omiſſion by giving ſuitable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and dies under age. A third caſe may be ſuppoſed, where the rational motive is not altogether ſo cogent. A man of an opulent fortune dies ſuddenly leaving a numerous family of children, all of the female ſex, without making proviſions for them. A collateral heir-male ſucceeds, who ſupplies this omiſſion by giving ſuitable proviſions, but dies under age. A court of equity would deviate from the ſpirit of its inſtitution, if it ſhould authoriſe a reduction of ſuch proviſions by the granter's heir, upon the head of minority and leſion. For a rational and laudable deed never can be leſion in any proper ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſame doctrine is applicable to thoſe who have a natural imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity which continues for life. A tranſaction made by ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not voided by a court of equity, unleſs it appear irrational and the effect of imbecillity. Where this is the caſe, it becomes indeed neceſſary that a court of equity interpoſe, though there can be no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule for direction.</p>
                  <p>The protection afforded by equity to the weak in mind, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſave them from hurting themſelves by irrational ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The opinions of men with reſpect to the management of affairs, and the exerciſing acts of property, are not leſs various than their faces: and as the world is ſeldom agreed about what is right and wrong in ſuch matters, there can be no rule for reſtraining the ſettlements of thoſe who are not remarkably weak, unleſs ſuch ſettlements be not only irrational but abſurd. But as the weak and facile are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0743600300:91"/>
protected from unequal bargains, there is the ſame reaſon for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting them from abſurd ſettlements. Take the following example. In a proceſs at the inſtance of a brother next of kin, for voiding a teſtament made by his deceaſed ſiſter in favour of a ſtranger, it came out upon proof, that, ſome time before making the teſtament, the teſtatrix, being ſeized with madneſs, was locked up; and that not long after making the teſtament her madneſs recurred, and continued till her death; that at the time of the teſtament ſhe was in a waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, ſometimes better, ſometimes worſe; in ſome particulars ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, in others little better than delirious, never perfectly ſound of mind. In particular, it appeared from the proof, that when in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter health, ſhe expreſſed much affection for her brother the purſuer; but that, when the diſeaſe was more upon her, ſhe appeared to have ſome grudge or reſentment at him without any cauſe. The teſtament was holograph; and the ſcroll ſhe copied was furniſhed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, in whoſe favour the teſtament was made, who had ready acceſs to her at all times, while her brother lived at a diſtance. In reaſoning upon this caſe it was yielded, that the woman was capable of making a teſtament, and that the teſtament challenged might be effectual at common law. But then it was urged, That though a teſtament made in the condition of mind above deſcribed, preferring one relation before another, a ſon before a father, or a ſiſter before a brother, might be ſupported in equity as well as at common law; yet that the teſtament in queſtion, proceeding not from rational views, but from a diſeaſed mind occaſioning a cauſeleſs reſentment againſt the purſuer, ought not to be ſupported in equity, being a deed which the teſtatrix herſelf muſt have been aſhamed of had ſhe recovered her health. Weight alſo was laid upon the following circumſtance, That the teſtament was made <hi>remotis arbitris,</hi> and kept a dead ſecret; which ſhowed the defendant's conſciouſneſs, that had there been acceſs to the teſtatrix, ſhe would have been eaſily diverted from making ſo irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional a ſettlement. In this view, it was conſidered as a wrong in him to take from her, in theſe circumſtances, ſuch an irrational deed; and conſequently, that he ought to be reſtrained in equity from taking any benefit by it. The teſtament was voided <note n="*" place="bottom">January 26. 1759, Tulloch contra Viſcount of Arbuthnot.</note>.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Powers of a court of equity to remedy what is imperfect in common law, with reſpect to the natural duty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.</head>
                  <p>IN the introduction there was occaſion to obſerve, that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of benevolence is by various connections converted into a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that duties of this kind, being neglected by the common law, are inforced by a court of equity. This opens a wide field of equity, boundleſs in appearance; and which would be ſo in reality as well as in appearance, were it not for one circumſtance, That the duty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence is much more limited than the virtue. The virtue of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence may be exerciſed by a great variety of good offices: it tends often to make additions to the poſitive happineſs of others, as well as to relieve them from diſtreſs or want. But abſtracting from poſitive engagement, the duty of benevolence is, with reſpect to pecuniary intereſt, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the latter. No connection, no ſituation, nor circumſtance, makes it my duty to increaſe the ſtock of any perſon who has already a ſufficiency, or to make him <hi>locupletior,</hi> as termed in the Roman law. For even in the ſtricteſt of all connections, that of parent and child, I feel not that I am in conſcience or in duty bound, to do more than to make my children independent, ſo as to preſerve them from want <note n="a" place="bottom">This propoſition is illuſtrated in the following caſe. Mary Scot, daughter of Scot of Highcheſter, having, by unlucky circumſtances, been reduced to indigence, was alimented by her mother Lady Mary Drummond, at the rate of L. 20 yearly. Lady Mary, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death, ſettled all her effects upon Mary Sharp, her daughter of another marriage, taking no other notice of her daughter Mary Scot, than the recommending her to the charity of Mary Sharp. After the mother's death, Mary Scot brought a proceſs for aliment againſt her ſiſter Mary Sharp, founded chiefly on the ſaid recommendation. A proof was taken of the extent of the effects contained in the ſettlement to the defendant, which amounted to about L. 300 Sterling. It was pretty obvious, that no action either in law or equity could be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the recommendation, very different in its nature from an obligation or a burden. But then it was ſtated, that the purſuer, being very young when her father died, was educated by her mother to no ſort of buſineſs by which ſhe could gain a livelihood: and it occurred to the court, that though the <hi>patria poteſtas</hi> is ſuch, that a peer may breed his ſon a cobler, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſettling him in buſineſs with a competent ſtock, is relieved from all further aliment; yet if a ſon be bred as a gentleman, without being inſtructed in any art that can gain him a farthing, he is intitled to be alimented for life; for otherwiſe a palpable abſurdity will follow, That a man may ſtarve his ſon, or leave him to want or beggary. Thus Lady Mary Drummond, breeding her daughter to no buſineſs, was, by the law of nature, bound to aliment her for life, or at leaſt till ſhe ſhould be otherwiſe provided for; and the purſuer therefore being a creditor for this aliment, has a good action againſt her mother's repreſentatives. The court accordingly found the purſuer intitled to an aliment of L. 12 Sterling yearly, and decerned againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant for the ſame.—8<hi>th March</hi> 1759, <hi>Mary Scot contra Mary Sharp.</hi>

Here is a clear circumſcription of equity, as far as concerns the preſent chapter. A court of equity cannot force one man, whether by his labour or money, to add to the riches of another; becauſe, abſtracting from a promiſe, no connection ever makes this a duty. What then is left for a court of equity, is, in certain circumſtances, to compel perſons to ſave from miſchief thoſe they are connected with, or to relieve them from want or diſtreſs. Benevolence, in this caſe, is a ſtrong impulſe to afford relief; and, in this caſe, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, aſſuming the name of <hi>pity</hi> or <hi>compaſſion,</hi> is, by a law in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made a poſitive duty. In all other caſes benevolence is a virtue only, not a duty: the exerciſe is left to our own choice; and the neglect is not puniſhed, though the practice is highly rewarded by the ſatisfaction it affords. In this branch of our nature, a beautiful final cauſe is viſible: the benevolence of man, by want of ability, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within narrow bounds; and in order to make the moſt of that ſlender power he has of doing good, it is wiſely directed where it is the moſt uſeful, <hi>viz.</hi> to relieve others from diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>It appears then, that equity, ſo far as concerns the duty of ſerving others, is not extended beyond pity or compaſſion. But it is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed within ſtill narrower bounds; for compaſſion, though a natural duty, is not adopted in its utmoſt extent by courts of equity. In many caſes, this duty is too vague and undetermined to be reached by human laws; and a court of equity pretends not to interpoſe, but where the duty, being clear and preciſe, can be brought under gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rules <note n="*" place="bottom">See the introduction.</note>. Some of the connections that occaſion duty ſo preciſe I ſhall proceed to handle, confining myſelf to thoſe that are in ſome meaſure involved in circumſtances; for the more ſimple connections, ſuch as that of parent and child, require little or no elucidation. Though all the duties of this kind that are inforced by a court of equity, belong to the principle of juſtice; they may however be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into different claſſes. The preſent chapter is accordingly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0743600300:94"/>
into two ſections. In the firſt are handled connections that make benevolence a duty when not prejudicial to our intereſt. In the ſecond are handled connections that make benevolence a duty even againſt our intereſt. Theſe connections are diſtinguiſhable from each other ſo clearly, as to prevent any confuſion of ideas; and the foregoing order is choſen, that we may paſs gradually from the ſlighter to the more intimate connections. To prompt a man to ſerve thoſe with whom he is connected, requires not any extraordinary motive, when the good office thwarts not his own intereſt: any ſlight connection is ſufficient to make this a duty, and therefore ſuch connections are firſt diſcuſſed. It requires a much ſtronger connection, to make it our duty to beſtow upon another any part of our ſubſtance. Self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is not to be overcome but by connections of the moſt intimate kind, which therefore are placed laſt in order.</p>

                     <head>SECT. I. Connections that make benevolence a duty when not prejudicial to our intereſt.</head>
                     <p>THE connection I ſhall firſt take under conſideration, is that which ſubſiſts between a creditor and a cautioner. The nature of this engagement, when punctually fulfilled, demands ſome gratitude from the creditor. The cautioner, when he pays the debt, ſuffers loſs by the act of the creditor, though not by his fault; and it is the duty of the creditor, as far as conſiſtent with his own intereſt, to aſſiſt the cautioner in operating his relief againſt the principal debtor. He ought, in particular, to convey to the cautioner, the bond with the execution done upon it, in order that the cautioner may the more ſpeedily compel the principal debtor to relieve him. The law, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring this moral act, conſiders the money delivered to the creditor, not as payment, but as a valuable conſideration for aſſigning his debt and execution to the cautioner. I cannot explain this better than in the words of Papinian, the moſt eminent of all the writers upon the Roman law: <q rend="inline">"Cum poſſeſſor unus, expediendi negotii cauſa, tributorum jure conveniretur; adverſus caeteros, quorum aeque praedia tenentur, ei, qui conventus eſt, actiones a fiſco prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantur: ſcilicet ut omnes pro modo praediorum pecuniam tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buti conferant: nec inutiliter actiones praeſtantur tametſi fiſcus pecuniam ſuam reciperaverit, quia nominum venditorum pretium
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0743600300:95"/>
acceptum videtur <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 5. De cenſibus.</note>."</q> From which conſideration it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that this aſſignment may be demanded and granted <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> if the precaution be omitted when the money is paid.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame principle it alſo follows, that the creditor is bound to convey to the cautioner every ſeparate ſecurity he has for the debt; and conſequently, that if the creditor diſcharge or paſs from his ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſecurity, the cautioner, ſo far as he ſuffers thereby, hath an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in equity againſt payment.</p>
                     <p>I muſt obſerve hiſtorically, that there are many deciſions of the court of ſeſſion, declaring the creditor not bound to grant the aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment firſt mentioned. Theſe deciſions, remote in point of time, will not be much regarded; becauſe the rules of equity lay formerly in greater obſcurity than at preſent. And there is an additional reaſon for diſregarding them, that they are not conſiſtent with others rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the ſame ſubject. If it be laid down as a rule, That the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is not bound to aſſign his bond and execution, however beneficial ſuch aſſignment may be by giving the cautioner ready execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the principal debtor; it ought to follow, that neither is he bound to aſſign any ſeparate ſecurity: if it be not his duty to ſerve the cautioner in the one caſe, it cannot be his duty to ſerve him in the other. And yet it is a rule eſtabliſhed in this court, That the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, making payment of the debt, is intitled to every ſeparate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of which the creditor is poſſeſſed. One is at no loſs to diſcover the cauſe of this diſcrepancy: when the queſtion is about a ſeparate ſecurity upon which the cautioner's relief may wholly depend, the principle of equity makes a ſtrong impreſſion: its impreſſion is ſlighter when the queſtion is only about aſſigning the bond, which has no other effect but to ſave a formal proceſs.</p>
                     <p>It is of the greater conſequence to ſettle with preciſion the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table rule that governs queſtions between the creditor and cautioner, becauſe upon it depends wholly, in my apprehenſion, the mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief between co-cautioners. Of two cautioners bound for the ſame debt at different times, and in different deeds, one pays the debt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a diſcharge without an aſſignment: where is the legal founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that intitles this man to claim the half from his fellow-caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? The being bound in different deeds affords no place for ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an implied ſtipulation of mutual relief: nay, ſuppoſing them bound in the ſame deed, we are not from that ſingle circumſtance to imply a mutual conſent for relief, but rather the contrary when the clauſe of mutual relief is omitted; for, in general, when an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0743600300:96"/>
clauſe is left out of a deed, it is natural to aſcribe the omiſſion to deſign rather than to forgetfulneſs. The principal debtor is <hi>ex mandato</hi> bound to relieve all his cautioners: but there is no medium at common law, by which one cautioner can demand relief from another. And with reſpect to equity, the connection of being bound for payment of the ſame debt, is too ſlight to intitle that cautioner who pays the whole debt, to be indemnified in part out of the goods of his fellow. It appears then, that the claim of mutual relief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong co-cautioners, can have no foundation other than the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the creditor to aſſign upon payment. This aſſignment in the caſe of a ſingle cautioner muſt be total; in the caſe of ſeveral muſt be <hi>pro rata;</hi> becauſe the creditor is equally connected with each of them. The only difficulty is, that at this rate, there is no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual relief unleſs an aſſignment be actually given. But this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is eaſily ſurmounted. We have ſeen above, that ſuch aſſignment may be granted <hi>ex poſt facto:</hi> hence it is the duty of the creditor to grant the aſſignment at whatever time demanded; and if the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor prove refractory, the law will interpoſe to hold an aſſignment as granted, becauſe it ought to be granted. And this ſuppletory or implied legal aſſignment, is the true foundation of the mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief among co-cautioners, which obtains both in Scotland and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                     <p>Utility alſo concurs to ſupport this equitable claim: no ſituation with regard to law would be attended with more pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, than to permit a creditor to oppreſs one cautioner and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve others: judges ought to be jealous of ſuch arbitrary powers, which will generally be directed by bad motives; often by reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, which is ſtill worſe, more often by avarice. It is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py therefore for mankind, that two different principles coincide in matters of this kind, to put them upon a juſt and ſalutary footing.</p>
                     <p>The creditor, as has been ſaid, being bound to all the cautioners equally, cannot legally give an aſſignment to one of them in ſuch terms as to intitle him to claim the whole from the other cautioners. In what terms then ought the aſſignment to be granted? or when granted without limitation, what effect ought it to have in equity? This is a queſtion of ſome ſubtilty. To permit the aſſignee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the whole from any ſingle co-cautioner, deducting only his own part of the debt, is unequal; becauſe it evidently gives the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee an advantage over his fellow-cautioners. On the other hand, the aſſignee is in a worſe ſituation than any other of the cautioners, if he muſt ſubmit to take from each of them ſeparately his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0743600300:97"/>
of the debt: upon this plan, the cautioner who pays the debt, is forc'd to run the circuit of all his co-cautioners; and if one or two prove inſolvent, he muſt renew the ſuit againſt the reſt, to make up the proportions of thoſe who are deficient. To preſerve therefore a real equality among the cautioners, every one of them againſt whom relief is claimed, ought to bear an equal proportion with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagnee. To explain this rule, I ſuppoſe ſix cautioners bound in a bond for ſix hundred pounds. The firſt paying the debt is intitled to claim the half from the ſecond, who ought to be equally bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with the firſt. When the firſt and ſecond again attack the third, they have a claim againſt him each for a hundred pounds; which reſolves in laying the burden of two hundred pounds upon each;—and ſo on till the whole cautioners be diſcuſſed. This method not only preſerves equality, but avoids after-reckonings in caſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvency.</p>
                     <p>So far clear when relief can be directly obtained. But what if the aſſignee be put to the trouble of adjudging for his relief? In that caſe, the aſſignment is a legal title to lead an adjudication for the whole debt. Equity is ſatisfied, if, by virtue of the adjudication, no more be actually drawn out of the eſtate of any of the co-cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, than that co-cautioner is bound to contribute as above. And in leading the adjudication, not even the adjudger's own proportion of the debt ought to be deducted: it is a benefit to the other caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that the ſecurity be as extenſive as poſſible; for it intitles the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judger to a greater proportion of the ſubject or price, in competition with extraneous creditors.</p>
                     <p>The ſame principles and concluſions are equally applicable to <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rei debendi,</hi> where a number of debtors are bound conjunctly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally to one creditor. Equity requires the utmoſt impartiality in him to his debtors: if for his own eaſe he take the whole from one, he is bound to grant an aſſignment preciſely as in the caſe of co-cautioners. Utility joins with equity to inforce this impartiality. And it makes no difference whether the <hi>correi debendi</hi> be bound for a civil debt or be bound <hi>ex delicto;</hi> for in both caſes equally it is the duty of the creditor to act impartially, and in both caſes equally uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity requires impartiality.</p>
                     <p>Another connection, of the ſame nature with the former, is that between one creditor who is infeft in two different tenements for his ſecurity, and another creditor who hath an infeftment on one of the tenements, of a later date. Here the two creditors are connected,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0743600300:98"/>
by having the ſame debtor, and a ſecurity upon the ſame ſubject. Hence it follows, as in the former caſe, that if the preferable credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor chuſe arbitrarily to draw his whole payment out of that ſubject in which the other creditor is infeft, the latter for his relief is intitled to have the preferable ſecurity aſſigned to him: which can be done upon the conſtruction above mentioned; for the ſum recovered by the preferable creditor out of the ſubject on which the other creditor is alſo infeft, is juſtly underſtood to be advanced by the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſum which he was intitled to, and muſt have drawn had not the preferable creditor interpoſed; and this ſum is held to be the purchaſe-money of the ſaid conveyance. This conſtruction, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the preferable debt entire in the perſon of the ſecond creditor, intitles him to draw payment of that debt out of the other tenement; and by this equitable conſtruction, matters are reſtored to the ſame ſtate as if the firſt creditor had drawn his payment out of the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſubject, leaving the other entire for payment of the ſecond credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Utility alſo, as ſaid above, concurs to ſupport this equitable claim.</p>
                     <p>It is ſcarce neceſſary here to obſerve, that a ſuppoſed conveyance, which may be ſufficient, as above mentioned, to found a claim of relief among co-cautioners, will not anſwer in the preſent caſe. In order to found an execution againſt land, there muſt be an infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this infeftment muſt be convey'd to the perſon who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands execution. Any juſt or equitable conſideration may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to found a perſonal action; but even perſonal execution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed without a formal warrant, and ſtill leſs real execution.</p>
                     <p>But now, admitting it to be the duty of the preferable creditor to grant an aſſignment, the queſtion is, To what extent? Whether ought the aſſignment to have a total effect, or only to reſtore the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creditor to that ſituation he would have been in, had the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creditor drawn his payment proportionally out of both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? It will be made appear by and by, that the aſſignment muſt be confined to the latter effect in the caſe of two ſecondary creditors. But there is no equity to limit the aſſignment in this manner, where there is no intereſt in oppoſition but that of the debtor. He has no equitable intereſt to oppoſe a total aſſignment; and the ſecond creditor has an equitable claim to all the aid the firſt creditor can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him.</p>
                     <p>The rules of equity muſt be the ſame in every country where law is cultivated. By the practice of England <note n="*" place="bottom">2. Chancery Caſes 4.</note>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the creditors ſweep
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0743600300:99"/>
away the perſonal eſtate, the real eſtate will be charged for payment of the legacies. In this caſe, the legatees need no aſſignment to found their equitable claim againſt the heir who ſucceeds to the real eſtate.</p>
                     <p>We proceed to another connection, which is that between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable creditor infeft on both tenements, and two ſecondary credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, one infeft in one of the tenements, and one in the other. The duty of the preferable or catholic creditor, with relation to theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary creditors, cannot be doubtful, conſidering what is ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. Equity as well as expediency bars him from arbitrary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. He is equally connected with his two fellow-creditors, and he muſt act impartially between them. The regular method is, that he draw his payment proportionally out of both tenements; but if, for his own eaſe or conveniency, he chuſe to draw the whole out of one, the poſtponed creditor is intitled to an aſſignment; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed total, which would be an arbitrary act, but proportional, ſo as to intitle the aſſignee to draw the ſame ſum out of the other ſubject, which he would have drawn out of his own, had the preferable cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor contented himſelf with a proportional draught out of both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. I need ſcarce mention, that the ſame rule which obtains in the caſe of ſecondary creditors, muſt equally obtain among purchaſers of different parcels of land, which before the purchaſe were all <hi>in cumulo</hi> burdened with an infeftment of annualrent. The ſame rule of equity is acknowledged in England. A man grants a rent-charge out of all his lands, and afterward ſells them by parcels to diverſe perſons: the grantee of the rent-charge levies his whole rent from one of theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers: this purchaſer ſhall be eaſed in equity by a contribution from the reſt of the purchaſers <note n="*" place="bottom">Abridg. caſes in equity, cap. 18. ſect. A. § 1.</note>.</p>
                     <p>A caſe connected with that laſt handled muſt not be overlooked, becauſe it will throw light upon the preſent ſubject. Let it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the catholic or preferable creditor purchaſes one of the ſecondary debts; will this vary the rule of equity? This purchaſe in itſelf lawful, is not prohibited by any ſtatute, and therefore muſt have its effect. The connection here between the creditors is by no means ſo intimate, as to oblige any one of them, at the expence of his own intereſt, to ſerve the others. There is no rule in equity to bar the catholic creditor from drawing full payment of the ſecondary debt out of the tenement which it burdens, reſerving his catholic debt to be made effectual out of the other tenement; though of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the ſecondary creditor upon that tenement is totally diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0743600300:100"/>
This ſecondary creditor has no claim for an aſſignment, total or partial, when the intereſt of the catholic creditor ſtands in oppoſition. But here the connection among the parties muſt, in my apprehenſion, have the following equitable operation, that the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic creditor, by virtue of his purchaſe, cannot draw more than the ſum he paid for it. Equity in this caſe will not allow the one to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the other's loſs. But a hint here muſt ſuffice; becauſe the point belongs more properly to another head <note n="*" place="bottom">Immediately below, ſect. 2. art. 1.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The following caſe proceeds upon the principle above laid down. The huſband, on the marriage, charged the lands with a rent-charge for a jointure to his wife, and afterward deviſed part of theſe lands to the wife. After the huſband's death the heir prayed that the lands deviſed to the wife might bear their proportion of the rent-charge: the bill was diſmiſſed, becauſe the grantee of the rent-charge may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain in all or any part of the lands for her rent; and there is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to abridge her remedy <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Vern. 347.</note>.</p>
                     <p>If the catholic creditor, after the exiſtence of both ſecondary debts, renounce his infeftment with reſpect to one of the tenements, which makes a clear fund for the ſecondary creditor ſecured upon that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement; ſuch renunciation ought to have no effect in equity againſt the other ſecondary creditor, becauſe it is an arbitrary deed, and a direct breach of that impartiality which the catholic creditor is bound to obſerve with relation to the ſecondary creditors. It is in effect the ſame with granting a total aſſignment to one of the ſecondary creditors againſt the other.</p>
                     <p>In every one of the caſes above mentioned, the catholic creditor is equally connected with each of the ſecondary creditors, and upon that account is bound to act impartially between them. But this rule of equity cannot take place where the connections are unequal. It holds here as among blood-relations; thoſe who are neareſt to me are intitled to a preference in my favour. The following caſe will be a ſufficient illuſtration. A man takes a bond of borrowed money with a cautioner; obtains afterward an infeftment from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal debtor as an additional ſecurity; and laſt of all, another creditor for his ſecurity obtains infeftment upon the ſame ſubject. Here the firſt-mentioned creditor has two different means for obtaining pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he may apply to the cautioner, or he may apply to the land in which he is infeft. He proceeds to execution againſt the land, by which he cuts out the ſecond creditor. Is he bound to grant an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0743600300:101"/>
to the ſecond creditor againſt the cautioner, total or partial? The ſecond creditor is in this caſe not intitled to demand an aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: on the contrary, the preferable creditor, taking payment from the cautioner, is bound to give him a total aſſignment; becauſe he is more intimately connected with the cautioner than with the ſecond creditor. A cautionary engagement is an act of pure benevolence; and when a creditor lays hold of this engagement to oblige one man to pay another's debt, this connection makes it evidently the duty of the creditor to aid the cautioner with an aſſignment, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to repair his loſs; and it proceeds from the ſame intimacy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, that, as above mentioned, he is obliged to include in this aſſignment every ſeparate ſecurity he has for the debt. It is his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty accordingly to convey to the cautioner the real ſecurity he got from the principal debtor. Nor is the intereſt of the ſecond creditor regarded in oppoſition; for he is no other way connected with the preferable creditor, but that both of them are creditors to the ſame perſon, and that both of them are infeft on the ſame ſubject for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                     <p>A queſtion of great importance that has frequently been canvaſſed in the court of ſeſſion, appears to depend upon the principles above ſet forth. The queſtion is this, Whether a tenant in tail be bound to extinguiſh the annual burdens ariſing during his poſſeſſion, ſo as to tranſmit to the heirs of entail the eſtate in as good condition as when he received it? To treat this queſtion accurately, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with conſidering how the common law ſtands. In the firſt place, feu-duties, ceſs, and teind, are <hi>debita fructuum,</hi> and at common law afford an action for payment againſt every perſon who levies the rents, and againſt a tenant in tail in particular. With reſpect then to the foregoing articles, there is no occaſion for equity: the common law burdens every tenant in tail with what of them become due during his poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>The entailer's perſonal debts are not a burden upon the fruits, but only upon the heirs of entail perſonally; and therefore the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medium for making the tenant in tail liable to relieve the heirs of entail of the current intereſt, fails here; and the queſtion is, Whether there be any other medium ſubjecting him at common law? We muſt ſeparate from this queſtion, the diviſion of burdens between heir and executor. If a tenant in tail leave any moveable eſtate, it will no doubt be charged at common law with the arrears of intereſt, and with every moveable ſum, principal or intereſt. But ſuppoſing that no moveable eſtate is left, and that the tenant in tail dies, leaving
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0743600300:102"/>
a land-eſtate of his own, deſcending to a different ſeries of heirs who do not repreſent the entailer: in this caſe, the arrears of intereſt ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the entailer's debts, muſt, with the principal, remain a debt upon the entailed eſtate at common law; unleſs it can be made out, that the tenant in tail became bound to relieve the heirs of entail of theſe arrears, in which caſe the arrears will be a charge upon his own eſtate.</p>
                     <p>An heir in a fee-ſimple is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no doubt, liable to the debts of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, and every heir is ſo liable ſucceſſively. But this obligation reſpects the creditors only, and affords no relief to one heir againſt another either for principal or intereſt. Does an entail make a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at common law? A tenant in tail poſſeſſes the rents: but theſe rents are his own property juſt as much as if the eſtate were a fee-ſimple; and the conſuming rents belonging to himſelf cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him as tenant in tail more than if his eſtate were a fee-ſimple. Hence it appears clear, that at common law a tenant in tail is not bound to relieve the heirs of entail of any growing burden, unleſs what is a <hi>debitum fructuum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A court of equity, leſs confined than a court of common law, finds that this caſe is reſolvable into one above determined, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>correi debendi,</hi> where ſeveral debtors are conjunctly bound for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one debt. There is no other difference between this caſe and heirs of entail, but that the former are all of them liable at the ſame time, whereas the latter are only liable ſucceſſively for payment of the entailer's debts, one after another; which makes no difference either in equity or in expediency, the ſame impartiality being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the creditor with reſpect to both. While the debt ſubſiſts, the creditor is bound to lay the burden of his intereſt upon each heir equally; and conſequently each heir is bound to pay the intereſt that ariſes during his time. And if the principal be demanded, the heir who pays is only intitled to an aſſignment of the principal ſum, and of the intereſt that ſhall ariſe after his own death. This rule accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly obtains in England, as where a proprietor of land, after char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it with a ſum of money, deviſes it to one for life, remainder to another in fee. Equity will compel the tenant for life to pay the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears due on the rent-charge, that all may not fall upon the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der man <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Chancery caſes 223.</note>.</p>
                     <p>A tenant by curteſy is, like a tenant in tail, bound to extinguiſh the current burdens. The curteſy is eſtabliſhed by cuſtomary law; and a court of equity is intitled to ſupply any defect in law, whether writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0743600300:103"/>
or cuſtomary, in order to make the law rational. The law, by authoriſing the huſband's poſſeſſion of the wife's eſtate, intends no more but to give him the enjoyment of it for life, without waſte, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining him to act like a <hi>bonus paterfamilias</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Decreed, Home, Jan. 3. 1717, Anna Monteith.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The following caſe ſeems to require the interpoſition of a court of equity; and yet whether its powers reach ſo far is doubtful. A man aſſigns to a relation of his L. 500 contained in a bond, without power of revocation, reſerving only his own liferent. Many years after, forgetting the aſſignment, he makes a will, naming this ſame rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his executor and reſiduary legatee, bequeathing in the teſtament the foreſaid bond of L. 500 to another relation. The teſtator's ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, abſtracting from the bond, not exceeding in value L. 500, it becomes to the executor nominate a matter indifferent, whether he accept the teſtament, or betake himſelf to his own bond. But it is not indifferent to others; for if he undertake the office of executor, he muſt convey the bond to the ſpecial legatee; if he cling to the bond, rejecting the office, the teſtament falls to the ground, and the next of kin will take the effects, leaving nothing to the ſpecial legatee. The intereſt of others ought not to depend on the arbitrary will of the executor nominate; and yet, as far as appears, there is no place here for the interpoſition of equity. The privilege of accepting or reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right no man can be deprived of; and, admitting this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, the conſequences that follow ſeem to be out of the reach of equity.</p>
                     <p>Land-eſtates that are conterminous, form ſuch a connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the proprietors, as to make certain acts of benevolence their duty, which belong to the preſent ſubject. To ſave my ground from water flowing upon it from a neighbouring field, a court of equity will intitle me to repair a bulwark within that field, provided the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration damage not the proprietor <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 2. § 5. in ſine, de aqua, et aquae pluviae areen.</note>. The following is a ſimilar caſe. The courſe of a rivulet which ſerves my mill happens to be diverted, a torrent having filled with ſtones or mud the channel in my neighbour's ground above. I will be permitted to remove the obſtruction though in my neighbour's property, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the rivulet to its natural channel. My neighbour is bound to ſuffer this operation, becauſe it relieves me from damage without harming his property.</p>
                     <p>But in order to procure any actual profit, or to make myſelf <hi>locu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletior,</hi> equity will not interpoſe or intitle me to make any alteration
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0743600300:104"/>
in my neighbour's property, even where he cannot ſpecify any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by the alteration. The reaſon is given above, That equity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obliges any man, whether by acting or ſuffering, to increaſe the riches of another. Thus the Earl of Eglinton having built a mill upon the river of Irvine, and ſtretched a dam-dike croſs the channel, which occaſioned a reſtagnation to the prejudice of a ſuperior mill, Fairly the proprietor of this mill brought a proceſs, complaining that his mill was hurt by the back-water, and concluding that the Earl's dam-dike be demoliſhed, or ſo altered as to give a free courſe to the river. The reſtagnation being acknowledged, the Earl propoſed to raiſe the purſuer's mill-wheel ten inches, which would make the mill go as well as formerly; offering ſecurity at the ſame time againſt all future damage; and urged, that to refuſe ſubmitting to this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be acting <hi>in aemulationem vicini,</hi> which the law doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge. The court judged the defendant's dam-dike to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on the purſuer's property, and ordained the ſame to be removed or taken down as far as it occaſioned the reſtagnation <note n="*" place="bottom">Jan. 27. 1744, Fairly contra Earl of Eghnton.</note>.</p>

                     <p>THeſe connections muſt be very intimate; for, as obſerved in the beginning of the preſent chapter, it requires a much ſtronger connection to oblige us to beſtow upon another any portion of our ſubſtance, than merely to do a good office which takes nothing from us. The bulk of theſe connections, though extremely various, may, I imagine, be brought under the following heads. 1ſt Connections that intitle a man to have his loſs made up out of our gain. 2d, Connections that intitle a man who is not, properly ſpeaking, a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, to partake of our gain. 3d, Connections that intitle one who is a loſer to a recompence from one who is not a gainer.</p>

                           <hi>ART. I.</hi> Connections that intitle a man to have his loſs made up out of our gain.</head>
                        <p>No perſonal connection, however intimate, ſuppoſing even that of parent and child, can make it an act of juſtice, that one who
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0743600300:105"/>
is a gainer ſhould repair the loſs ſuſtained by another, unleſs there be alſo ſome connection between the loſs and gain; and this connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a capital circumſtance in the preſent ſpeculation. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections hitherto mentioned relate to perſons; this relates to things. If, for example, I lay out my money for meliorating a ſubject which I conſider to be my own, but which is afterward diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the property of another; my loſs in this caſe is intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected with his gain, becauſe in effect my money comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his pocket.</p>
                        <p>The connection between the loſs and gain may be more or leſs intimate: and its different degrees of intimacy ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully noted; becauſe it is reaſonable to preſume, what will be found true by induction, that where-ever it becomes a man's duty to apply his gain for repairing another's loſs, there muſt be an intimate connection between loſs and gain. When this connection is found in the higheſt degree, there is ſcarce requiſite any other circumſtance to found the duty: in its lower degrees no duty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, unleſs the perſons be otherwiſe ſtrongly connected. Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then to trace theſe degrees, the loweſt I ſhall have occaſion to mention, is where the loſs and gain are connected by their relation to the ſame ſubject. For example, a man purchaſes at a low rate one of the preferable debts upon a bankrupt eſtate; and upon a ſale of the eſtate draws more than the tranſacted ſum: he gains while his fellow-creditors loſe conſiderably. The next degree going upward, is where my gain is the occaſion of another's loſs. For example, a merchant foreſeeing a ſcarcity, purchaſes all the corn he can find in the neighbourhood, with a view to make great profit: before he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens his granaries, I import a large cargo from abroad, parcelling it out at a moderate price, under what my brother-merchant paid for his cargo; by which means he loſes conſiderably. The third, pretty much upon a level with the former, is where another's loſs is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of my gain. For example, my ſhip loaded with corn proceeds, in company with another, to a port where there is a ſcarcity: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhip being foundered in a ſtorm, and the cargo loſt, my cargo by that means draws a better price. The fourth connection is more intimate, the loſs and the gain proceeding from the ſame cauſe. In the caſe laſt mentioned, ſuppoſe the weaker veſſel, daſhed againſt the other in a ſtorm, is ſunk: here the ſame cauſe by which the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor loſes, proves beneficial to the other. The laſt connection I ſhall mention, and the completeſt, is where that which is loſt by the one is gained by the other; or, in other words, where the money of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0743600300:106"/>
which the one is deprived is converted to the other's benefit. This is the caſe firſt of all mentioned, of money laid out by a <hi>bona fide poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> in meliorating a ſubject which is afterward claimed by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor. The money that the former loſes is gained by the latter.</p>
                        <p>A famous maxim of the Roman law, <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena jactura,</hi> belongs to this article: and in order to aſcertain, if it can be done, what are the connections that make it the duty of one man to part with his gain for repairing another's loſs, I ſhall begin with a commentary upon that maxim. The firſt obſervation is, That it is expreſſed abſtractly, as holding true in general, without diſtinction of perſons; and therefore that the duty it eſtabliſhes muſt be founded upon a real connection, independent altogether of perſonal connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which leads us to examine what that real connection muſt be. <hi>Nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura,</hi> or, No perſon ought to profit <hi>by</hi> another's loſs, implies a connection between the loſs and the gain: it implies that the gain ariſes <hi>by</hi> the loſs, or <hi>by means</hi> of the loſs. Taking therefore the maxim literally, it ought to take place where-ever the gain is occaſioned by the loſs, or perhaps occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the loſs; which certainly is not good law. My ſhip loaded with corn proceeds, along with another, to a port where there is a ſcarcity. The other ſhip being loſt in a ſtorm, my cargo by that means draws a better price: I am benefited by another's loſs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, two veſſels loaded with corn are daſhed againſt each other in a ſtorm, and the weaker is ſunk; by which means the cargo in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſells at a higher price. In both examples, the ſame cauſe that deſtroys the one merchant is profitable to the other: yet no man who in ſuch circumſtances makes profit, finds himſelf bound in conſcience to beſtow his profit upon repairing the other's loſs. It appears then that this maxim, like moſt general maxims, is apt to miſlead by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too comprehenſive. Reflecting upon this ſubject, we find, that nothing which a man acquires by his own means, or by accident, however connected with the loſs ſuſtained by another, will ever, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of ſome perſonal connection, bind him to make up that loſs out of his gain. The only real connection that ſingly binds him, is where another's money is converted to his uſe. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though without any intention to benefit him, will bind him in conſcience to make up that other's loſs as far as he himſelf is a gainer. Here the maxim, <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in its ſtricteſt ſenſe, is applicable; and the ſingle caſe, ſo far as I underſtand, where it is applicable. The moſt noted caſe of this kind is where the poſſeſſor of a ſubject which he <hi>bona ſide</hi> conſiders to be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0743600300:107"/>
his own, lays out his money on reparations and meliorations, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but his own benefit: the true proprietor claims the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a proceſs, and prevails: he profits by the meliorations, and the money beſtowed on theſe meliorations is converted to his uſe. Every one in that caſe muſt be ſenſible of a hardſhip that requires a remedy; and it muſt be the wiſh of every diſintereſted perſon, that the <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor</hi> be relieved from this hardſhip. That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law affords no relief, will be evident at firſt ſight: the labour and money of the <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor</hi> is ſunk in the ſubject, and has no longer any ſeparate exiſtence upon which to found a <hi>rei vindicatio:</hi> the proprietor at the ſame time, in claiming the ſubject, does no more but exerciſe his own right, which cannot ſubject him perſonally to any demand at the inſtance of the <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor.</hi> If then there be a remedy, it can have no other foundation but equity; and that there is a remedy in equity will appear from the following conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Man being a fallible creature, ſociety would be an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſtate were individuals diſpoſed in every caſe to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the miſtakes and errors of others. But the author of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has more harmoniouſly adjuſted its different branches to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To make it a law in our nature, never to take advantage of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in any caſe, would be giving too much indulgence to indolence and remiſſion of mind, tending to make us neglect the improvement of our rational faculties. On the other hand, to make it lawful to take advantage of error in every caſe, would be too rigorous, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how difficult it is for a man to be always upon his guard. The author of our nature has happily moulded it ſo as to avoid theſe extremes. No man is conſcious of wrong when he takes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an error committed by another to ſave himſelf from loſs: if there muſt be a loſs, natural juſtice dictates, that it ought to reſt upon the perſon who has committed an error, however innocently, rather than upon him who has been careful to avoid all error. But <hi>in lucro captando,</hi> the moral ſenſe teaches a different leſſon: every one is conſcious of wrong, when an error is laid hold of to make gain by it. The conſciouſneſs of injuſtice, when ſuch advantage is taken, is indeed inferior in degree, but the ſame in kind with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of robbing an innocent perſon of his goods or of his reputation. This doctrine is ſupported by utility as well as by juſtice. Induſtry ought to be encouraged; and chance as much as poſſible ought to be excluded from all dealings, in order that individuals may promiſe to themſelves the fruits of their own induſtry. This affords a freſh inſtance of that beautiful harmony which ſubſiſts between the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0743600300:108"/>
and external conſtitution of man. A regular chain of cauſes and effects, leaving little or nothing to accident, is advantageous exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by promoting induſtry, and is not leſs ſo internally by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it affords the human mind. No ſcene is more diſguſtful than to ſee all things going on by chance, without order or connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When a court of equity therefore preſerves to every man, as much as poſſible, the fruits of his own induſtry; ſuch proceeding, by rectifying the diſorders of chance, is authoriſed by utility as well as by juſtice. And hence it is a principle of morality, founded both on the nature of man and on the intereſts of ſociety, That we ought not to make gain by another's error.</p>
                        <p>This principle is directly applicable to the caſe above mentioned. The titles of land-property being intricate, and often uncertain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are frequent, where a man in poſſeſſion of land, the property of another, is led by unavoidable error to conſider it as belonging to himſelf: his money is beſtow'd without heſitation in repairing and meliorating the ſubject. Equity will not permit the true owner to profit by ſuch miſtake, and in effect to pocket the money of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent poſſeſſor; and a court of equity interpoſes to oblige the owner to make up the loſs as far as he is <hi>locupletior.</hi> Thus the poſſeſſor of a tenement, having, upon the faith and belief of its being his own, made conſiderable meliorations, was, after voiding his title, found intitled to claim from the proprietor the expence of ſuch meliorations as were profitable to him by raiſing the rent of his tenement <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, January 18. 1676, Binning contra Brotherſtanes.</note>. In all caſes of this kind, it can be qualified in the ſtricteſt manner, that what is loſt to the one accrues to the other. The maxim then muſt be underſtood in this limited ſenſe; for no connection between the loſs and gain inferior in degree to this, will, independent of perſonal connections, be a ſufficient foundation for a claim in equity againſt the perſon who gains, to make up the other's loſs.</p>
                        <p>But ſuppoſing the ſubject meliorated to have periſhed before bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the action, is the proprietor notwithſtanding liable? I anſwer, That where equity makes benevolence a duty to thoſe who benefit us without intending it, it is not ſufficient that there has been gain one time or other: it is implied in the nature of the claim, that there muſt be gain at the time of the demand; for if there be no gain at preſent, there is no ſubject out of which the loſs can be made up.</p>
                        <p>It will not be thought an unneceſſary digreſſion to obſerve a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity in the Roman law with reſpect to this matter. As that law
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0743600300:109"/>
ſtood originally, the <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor</hi> had no claim for his expences. This did not proceed from ignorance of equity, but from want of a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula</hi> to authoriſe the action; for at firſt when brieves or forms of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were invented <note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 8.</note>, this claim was not thought of. But an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſoon thought of to intitle the <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor</hi> to retain the ſubject, till he got payment of his expence: and this exception the judges could have no difficulty to ſuſtain, becauſe exceptions were not ſubjected to any <hi>formula.</hi> The inconvenient reſtraint of theſe <hi>formulae</hi> was in time broke through, and <hi>actiones in factum,</hi> or <hi>upon the caſe,</hi> were introduced, which were not confined to any <hi>formula.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this innovation, the ſame equity that gave an exception, produced alſo an <hi>actio in factum;</hi> and the <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor</hi> was made ſecure as to his expences in all caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> by an exception while he remained in poſſeſſion, and by an action if he happened to loſe the poſſeſſion.</p>
                        <p>Another caſe, differing nothing from the former in effect though conſiderably in its circumſtances, is where, upon a fictitious mandate, one purchaſes my goods, or borrows my money, for the uſe of another. That other is not liable <hi>ex mandato,</hi> becauſe he gave no commiſſion: but if I can prove that the money or goods were actually applied for his uſe, equity affords me a claim againſt him, as far as he is a gainer. Thus, in an action for payment of merchant-goods purchaſed in name of the defendant, and applied to his uſe, the defendant inſiſted, that he had given no commiſſion; and that if his name was uſed without his authority, he could not be liable. <q rend="inline">"It was decreed, That the goods being applied to the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant's uſe, he was liable, unleſs he could prove that he paid the price to the perſon who beſpoke the goods <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, February 20. 1669, Bruce contra Stanhope.</note>."</q> This caſe, like the former, reſts entirely upon the real connection between the loſs and gain, independent of which there was no connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parties. And in the preſent caſe, perhaps more clearly than in the former, every one muſt be ſenſible, that the man who reaps the benefit is in duty bound to repair the other's loſs. And hence the action <hi>de in rem verſo,</hi> the name of which we borrow from the Romans. In a caſe preciſely ſimilar, the court inclined to ſuſtain it relevant to aſſoilzie or acquit the defendant, that the goods were gifted to him by the perſon who purchaſed them in his name. But as donation is not preſumed, he was found liable, becauſe he could not bring evidence of the alledged donation <note n="‡" place="bottom">July 1726, Hawthorn contra Urquhart.</note>. Upon the ſuppoſition
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0743600300:110"/>
of a gift, it could not well be ſpecified that the deſendant was <hi>locu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletior:</hi> a man will ſpend liberally what he conſiders as a preſent, though he would not lay out his money upon the purchaſe.</p>
                        <p>Having endeavoured to aſcertain, with all poſſible accuracy, that degree of connection between the loſs and gain, which is requiſite to afford a relief in equity, by obliging the perſon who gains to make up the other's loſs, I proceed to aſcertain the preciſe meaning of loſs and gain as underſtood in the maxim. And the firſt doubt that occurs is, Whether the term <hi>locupletior</hi> comprehend every real benefit, prevention of loſs as well as a poſitive increaſe of fortune; or whether it be confined to the latter. I explain myſelf by examples. When a <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor</hi> rears a new edifice upon another man's ground, this is a poſitive acceſſion to the ſubject, which makes the proprietor <hi>locupletior</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word. But it may happen that the money laid out by the <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor</hi> is directed to prevent loſs; as where he fortifies the bank of a river againſt its incroachments, where he ſupports a tottering edifice, or where he tranſacts a claim that threatened to carry off the property. Is the maxim applicable to caſes of this nature, where loſs is only prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any poſitive increaſe of wealth or fortune? When a work is done that prevents loſs, the ſubject is thereby improved and made of greater value. A bulwark that prevents the incroachments of a river, makes the land ſell at a higher price; and a real acceſſion, ſuch as a houſe built, or land incloſed, will not do more. The only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, that a poſitive acceſſion makes a man richer than he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was; a work done to prevent loſs makes him only richer than he would have been had the work been left undone. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is too ſlight to have any effect in equity. The proprietor gains by both equally; and in both caſes equally he will feel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound in juſtice to make up the loſs out of his gain. A <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor</hi> who claims money laid out by him to ſupport a tottering edifice, is <hi>certans de damno evitando,</hi> as well as where he claims money laid out upon meliorations; and the proprietor claiming the ſubject, is <hi>certans de lucro captando</hi> in the one caſe as well as in the other. But in this competition, equity prefers the claim of him who is <hi>certans de damno evitando;</hi> for, as obſerved above, there is in human nature a clear ſenſe of wrong, where a man avails himſelf of an error to make profit at another's expence. Nor does the principle of utility make any diſtinction. It is a great object in ſociety, to rectify the diſorders of chance, and to preſerve to every man, as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the fruits of his own induſtry; in which view, it makes no
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0743600300:111"/>
difference, whether a man's induſtry has been applied to prevent loſs, or to make a real acceſſion to his fortune. In the caſes accordingly that have occurred, I find no diſtinction made; and in thoſe which follow there was no benefit but what aroſe from preventing loſs. A ſhip being ranſomed from a privateer, every perſon benefited muſt contribute a proportion of the ranſom <note n="*" place="bottom">Fountainhall, June 29. 1710, Ritchie contra Lord Salton.</note>. A written teſtament being voided for informality, the executor nominate was allowed the expence of confirming the teſtament, becauſe to the executrix <hi>qua</hi> next in kin, purſuer of the reduction, it was profitable by ſaving her the expence of a confirmation <note n="†" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Feb. 26. 1712, Moncrieff contra Monypenny.</note>.</p>
                        <p>From what is ſaid, it may poſſibly be thought, that the foregoing rule of equity is applicable where-ever it can be ſubſumed, that the loſs ſuſtained by one has accrued to the benefit of another. But this will be found a raſh concluſion, when it is conſidered, that one may be benefited without being in any proper ſenſe <hi>locupletior,</hi> or a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the whole. I give an example. A man erecting a large te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement in a borough, becomes bankrupt by overſtretching his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. This new tenement, being the chief part of his ſubſtance, is adjudged by his creditors for ſums beyond the value. In the mean time, the tradeſmen and the furniſhers of materials for the building, truſting to a claim in equity, forbear to adjudge. They are loſers to the extent of their work and furniſhings; and the adjudgers are in one ſenſe <hi>locupletiores,</hi> as by means of the tenement they will draw perhaps ten ſhillings in the pound inſtead of five. Are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgers then, in terms of the maxim, bound to yield this profit, in order to pay the workmen and furniſhers? By no means. For here the benefit is partial only, and produceth not upon the whole actual profit: on the contrary, the adjudgers, even after this benefit, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with their competitors <hi>certantes de damno evitando.</hi> The court of ſeſſion accordingly refuſed to ſuſtain the claim of the tradeſmen and furniſhers <note n="‡" place="bottom">Dec. 4. 1735, Burns contra creditors of Maclellan.</note>. Hence appears a remarkable difference between property and obligation. Money laid out upon a ſubject by the <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor,</hi> whether for melioration or to preſerve it from damage, makes the proprietor <hi>locupletior,</hi> and a <hi>captator lucri ex aliena jactura.</hi> But though a creditor be benefited by another's loſs, ſo as by that means to draw a greater proportion of his debt, he is not, however, a gainer upon the whole, but is ſtill <hi>certans de damno evitando.</hi> And when the parties are thus <hi>in pari caſu,</hi> a court of equity cannot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but muſt leave them to the common law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0743600300:112"/>
I add another limitation, which is not peculiar to the maxim un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, but ariſes from the very conſtitution of a court of equity. It is not ſufficient that there be gain, even in the ſtricteſt ſenſe: it is neceſſary that the gain be clear and certain; for otherwiſe a court of equity muſt not undertake to repair the loſs out of that gain. The principle of utility, in order to prevent arbitrary proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, prohibits a court of equity to take under conſideration a conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural loſs or a conjectural gain, becauſe ſuch loſs or gain can never be brought under a general rule. I give the following illuſtrations. Two heritors having each of them a ſalmon-fiſhing in the ſame part of a river, are in uſe to exerciſe their rights alternately. One is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted for ſome time by a ſuit at the inſtance of a third party: the other by this means has more capture than uſual, though he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not his manner of fiſhing. What the one loſes by the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is probably gained by the other, at leaſt in ſome meaſure. But as what is here transferred from the one to the other cannot be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with any degree of certainty, a court of equity muſt not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Again, a tenant upon the faith of a long leaſe, lays out conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſums upon improving his land, and reaps the benefit a few years. But the landlord, who holds the land by a military tenure, dies ſuddenly in the flower of his age, leaving an infant heir: the land by this means comes into the ſuperior's hand, and the leaſe is ſuperſeded during the ward. Here a great part of the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meliorations which the leſſee intended for his own benefit, are converted to the uſe of the ſuperior. Yet equity cannot interpoſe, becauſe no general rule can be laid down for aſcertaining the gain made by the ſuperior. I have one caſe to quote which confirms this doctrine. In an action at a tercer's inſtance for a third of the rents levied by the fiar, the court refuſed to ſuſtain a deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion claimed by the defendant, <hi>viz.</hi> a third of the factor-fee paid by him for levying the rents, though it was urged, that the purſuer could not have levied her third with leſs expence <note n="*" place="bottom">Durie, March 27. 1634, Lady Dunſermline contra her ſon.</note>. The loſs here was not aſcertained, and was ſcarce capable of being aſcertained; for no one could ſay what leſs the factor would have accepted for levying two thirds of the rent than for levying the whole. Neither was the profit capable to be aſcertained: the lady herſelf might have uplifted her ſhare, or have got a friend to ſerve her <hi>gratis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſhall cloſe with one further limitation, which regards not only the preſent ſubject, but every claim that can be founded on equity. Courts of equity are introduced in every country to inforce natural
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0743600300:113"/>
juſtice, and by no means to give aid to any wrong. Whence it follows, that no man can be intitled to the aid of a court of equity, when that aid becomes neceſſary by his own fault. For this reaſon, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor is made liable for the expence of profitable meliorations, this can only be when the meliorations were made <hi>bona fide</hi> by a perſon reaſonably intending his own profit, and not ſuſpecting any hazard. It is laid down however in the Roman law, That the neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence laid out in upholding the ſubject, may be claimed by the <hi>mala ſide poſſeſſor</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 5. C. De rei vindic.</note>. If ſuch reparations be made while the proprietor is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his right, and the ruin of the edifice be thereby prevented, there poſſibly may be a foundation in utility for the claim: but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there can be any foundation in juſtice. And therefore, if a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, after being ejected by legal execution, ſhall obſtinately perſiſt to plow and ſow, he ought to have no claim for his ſeed nor his labour. The claim in theſe circumſtances hath no foundation either in juſtice or utility: yet the claim was ſuſtained <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, February 22. 1671, Gordon contra Macculloch.</note>.</p>
                        <p>But there are many perſonal connections joined with a much ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er real connection than that above mentioned, which intitle a man to have his loſs made up out of our gain. Of which take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examples.</p>
                        <p>There are three creditors connected, firſt by their relation to the ſame debtor who is a bankrupt; and next, by their relation to two land-eſtates A and B belonging to the debtor, the firſt creditor being preferably ſecured on both eſtates, one of the ſecondary creditors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured upon A, the other upon B. The catholic creditor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes one of the ſecondary debts under its value, by which he is a gainer; for by his preferable debt he cuts out the other ſecondary creditor, and by that means draws the whole price of the two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The queſtion is, Whether equity will ſuffer him to retain his gain againſt the other ſecondary creditor, who is thus cut out of his ſecurity? It cannot indeed be ſpecified here, as in the caſe of the <hi>bonae ſidci poſſeſſor rei alienae,</hi> that money given out by the one is converted to the uſe of the other: but then the loſs and gain are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily connected by having a common cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the purchaſe made by the catholic creditor. This connection between loſs and gain, joined with the perſonal connections above mentioned, make it the duty of the catholic creditor to communicate his profit, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make up the loſs that the other creditor ſuſtains. And one may with confidence deliver this opinion, when the following cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0743600300:114"/>
is added, that the loſs was occaſioned by the catholic cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, in making a purchaſe that he was ſenſible would ruin his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creditor.</p>
                        <p>The next caſe in order, is of two aſſignees to the ſame bond, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of each other. The cedent or aſſignor contrives to draw the purchaſe-money from both, and walks off in a ſtate of bankruptcy. The latter aſſignment, being firſt intimated, will be preferred. But to what extent? Will it be preferred for the whole ſum in the bond, or only for the tranſacted ſum? The circumſtances of this caſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the poſtponed aſſignee, though they have not the ſame weight with thoſe in the former: the material difference is, that the aſſignee preferred made his purchaſe without knowing of his competitor, and conſequently without any thought of diſtreſſing him. The perſonal connection however, joined with the neceſſary connection between the loſs and gain, appears ſufficient to deprive the laſt aſſignee of his gain, in order to make up the loſs ſuſtained by the firſt. The caſe would be more doubtful, had the firſt aſſignment been firſt completed; becauſe it may appear hard, that the intervention of a ſecond pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer ſhould deprive the firſt of a profitable bargain. I leave this point to be ripened by time and mature deliberation. The progreſs of equity is ſlow, though conſtant, toward the more delicate articles of natural juſtice. If there appear any difficulty about extending equity to this caſe, the difficulty probably will vaniſh in courſe of time.</p>
                        <p>One thing is certain, that in the Engliſh court of chancery there would be no heſitation to apply equity to this caſe. That court ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its power a great way farther; farther indeed than ſeems juſt. A ſtranger, for example, who purchaſes a prior incumbrance, can draw no more from the other incumbrancers than the ſum he really paid <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Vernon 476.</note>: and to juſtify this extraordinary opinion, it is ſaid, <q rend="inline">"That the taking away one man's gain to make up another's loſs, is making them both equal."</q> This argument, if it prove any thing, proves too much, being applicable to any two perſons indifferently who have not the ſmalleſt connection, ſuppoſing only the one to have made a profitable, the other a loſing bargain. There ought to be ſome connection to found ſuch a demand: the perſons ought to be connected by a common concern; and the loſs and gain ought to be connected, ſo at leaſt as that the one be occaſioned by the other. The firſt connection only is found in this caſe: a ſtranger who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes a prior incumbrance is indeed, by a common ſubject, connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0743600300:115"/>
with the other incumbrancers: but this purchaſe does not harm the other incumbrancers; for when the purchaſer claims the debt in its utmoſt extent, it is no more than what his author was intitled to do. The rule of chancery, in this view, appears a little whimſical: it deprives me of a lucrative bargain, the fruit of my own induſtry, to beſtow it, not upon any perſon who is hurt by the bargain, but upon thoſe who are in no worſe condition than before the bargain was made. Neither am I clear, that this rule can be ſupported upon a principle of utility: for though it is preventive of hard and unequal bargains; yet as no prudent man will purchaſe an incumbrance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a condition, it is in effect a prohibition of ſuch purchaſes, which would prove a great inconveniency to many whoſe funds are locked up by the bankruptcy of their debtors.</p>
                        <p>That an heir acquiring an incumbrance ſhould be allowed no more but what he really paid, or, which comes to the ſame, that he ſhould be bound to communicate eaſes, is a propoſition more agreeable to the principles of equity. This is the law of England <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Salkeld 155.</note>, and it is the law of Scotland with regard to heirs who take the benefit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory. But the caſe of an heir is very different from that of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He hath in his hand the fund for payment of the creditors, which he ought faithfully to account for; and therefore he is not permitted to ſtate any article for exhauſting that fund beyond what he hath actually expended: if a creditor accept leſs than his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the fund for the other creditors is ſo much the larger.</p>
                        <p>A cautioner upon making payment obtaining an eaſe, muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the ſame to the principal debtor, upon a plain ground in common law, that being ſecure of his relief from the principal debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, he can have no claim but to be kept <hi>indemnis.</hi> But ſuppoſing the principal debtor bankrupt, I diſcover no ground other than paction, that can bind one cautioner to communicate eaſes to another: and yet it is the prevailing, I may ſay the eſtabliſhed, opinion, That a cautioner who obtains an eaſe muſt communicate the benefit to his co-cautioner. I am aware of the reaſon commonly aſſigned, That cautioners for the ſame debt are to be conſidered as in a ſociety, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to bear the loſs equally. But this, I doubt, is arguing in a circle: they reſemble a ſociety, becauſe the loſs muſt be equal; and the loſs muſt be equal, becauſe they reſemble a ſociety. We muſt therefore go more accurately to work. In the firſt place, let us examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an obligation for mutual relief ought to be implied. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, at beſt doubtful, ſuppoſes the cautioners to have ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0743600300:116"/>
in a body. And therefore, to leave no room for an implied ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, we need but ſuppoſe, that two perſons, ignorant of each other, become cautioners at different times, and in different deeds. It appears, then, that common law affords not an obligation for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual relief. The matter is ſtill more clear with regard to equity: for the connection between two cautioners can never be ſo intimate, as to oblige the one who is not a gainer to make up the other's loſs; which is the caſe of the cautioner who obtains an eaſe, ſuppoſing that eaſe to be leſs than that proportion of the debt which he ſtands bound to pay. Upon the whole, my notion is, that if a cautioner, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of objections againſt the debt, or upon account of any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that regards the principal debtor, obtain an eaſe, he is bound to communicate that eaſe to his fellow-cautioner, upon the following rational principle, That both cautioners ought equally to partake of an eaſe, the motive to which reſpects them equally. This clearly enough appears to be the <hi>ratio decidendi</hi> in the caſe reported by Stair, July 27. 1672, Brodie contra Keith. But if upon prompt payment by one cautioner after the failure of others, or upon any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perſonal to the cautioner, an eaſe be given; equity, I think, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges not the cautioner to communicate the benefit to his fellow-cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. And this was decreed, Stair, July 8. 1664, Niſbet contra Leſſie.</p>
                        <p>There is one circumſtance that, without much connection real or perſonal, extends to many caſes the maxim, <hi>Quod nemo debet locuple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari aliena jactura;</hi> and that is fraud, deceit, or any ſort of wrong. If by means of a third perſon's fraud one gains and another loſes, a court of equity will interpoſe to make up the loſs out of the gain. And this reſolves into a general rule, <q rend="inline">"That no man, however innocent, ought to take advantage of a tortious act by which another is hurt."</q> Take the following example. A ſecond diſpoſition of land, though gratuitous, with the firſt infeftment, is preferred in common law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt diſpoſition without infeftment, though for a valuable conſideration. But as the gratuitous diſponee is thus benefited by a moral wrong done by his author, he ought not, however innocent, to take advantage of that moral wrong to hurt the firſt diſponee. This circumſtance makes the rule applicable, <hi>Quod non debet locuple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari alicna jactura;</hi> and therefore a court of equity will compel him, either to give up his right to the land, or to repair the loſs the firſt diſponee has ſuffered by being deprived of his purchaſe.</p>
                        <p>The following caſes reſt upon the ſame principle. A diſpoſition by a merchant of his whole eſtate to his infant-ſon, without a reſerved
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0743600300:117"/>
liferent or power to burden, was deemed fraudulent, in order to cheat his correſpondents, foreign merchants, who had traded with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the alienation, and continued their dealings with him upon the belief that he was ſtill proprietor; and their claims, though poſterior to the diſpoſition, were admitted to affect the eſtate <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, July 2. 1673, Street contra Maſon.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Where a tutor acting to the beſt of his ſkill for the good of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, happens, in the ordinary courſe of adminiſtration, to convert a moveable debt into one that is heritable, or an heritable debt into one that is moveable; ſuch an act, after the pupil's death, will have its full effect with reſpect to the pupil's ſucceſſion, by preferring his heir or executor, as if the act had been done by a proprietor of full age. But where the tutor acts in this manner unneceſſarily, with the ſole intention to prefer the heir or the executor, this is a tortious act, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the duty he owes his pupil, which will affect the heir or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, though they had no acceſſion to the wrong. In common law the ſucceſſion will take place according to the tutor's act, whether done with a right or a wrong intention; but this will be corrected in equity, upon the principle, That no perſon ought to take advantage of a tortious act that harms another.</p>
                        <p>A donation <hi>inter virum et uxorem</hi> is revocable; but not a donation to the huſband or wife's children, or to any other relation. A wife makes a donation of her land-eſtate to her huſband; who afterward, in order to bar revocation, gives up the diſpoſition granted to him, and inſtead of it takes a diſpoſition to his eldeſt ſon. Will this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be revocable? Where a wife out of affection to her huſband's eldeſt ſon makes a deed in his favour, it is not revocable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a <hi>donatio inter virum et uxorem.</hi> But in this caſe it is clear, that the donation was really intended for the huſband, and that the ſole purpoſe of the diſpoſition to the ſon was to bar revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which was an unlawful contrivance to elude the law. It would be wrong therefore in the ſon, however innocent, to take advantage of his father's tortious act, calculated to deprive the woman of her privilege; and therefore the diſpoſition to him will be revocable in equity, as that to the father was at common law.</p>

                        <p>FOR the ſake of perſpicuity, this article ſhall be divided into two branches: 1ſt, Where the gain is the operation of the man who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0743600300:118"/>
claims to partake of it. 2d, Where he has not contributed to the gain.</p>
                        <p>I introduce the firſt branch with a caſe which will be a key to the ſeveral matters that come under it. Two heirs-portioners, or in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral two proprietors of a land-eſtate <hi>pro indiviſo,</hi> get for a farm, having a lake in it, a rent of eighty pounds yearly, with an offer of ten pounds additional rent if they will drain the lake. A is willing; but B refuſes, judging it to be impracticable, or at leaſt too expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. A however proceeds at his own riſk; and for the ſum of L. 100 drains the lake. He cannot ſpecify any loſs by this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; becauſe the ſum he laid out is more than compenſated by the five pound additional rent accruing to him: and therefore the maxim, <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena juctura,</hi> is not applicable to his caſe. But B is a profiter, not only by A's advancing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but at his riſk; for if the undertaking had proved abortive, A would have loſt both his labour and money. Is it agreeable to the rules of juſtice, that B ſhould be permitted to lay hold of an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rent of L. 5, without defraying any part of the expence laid out upon the acquiſition? He cannot juſtify this to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor to any human being. The moral ſenſe dictates, that where expence is laid out in improving or repairing a common ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, no one ought to lay hold of the benefit, without refunding a part of the expence in proportion to the benefit received.</p>
                        <p>This leads to a general rule, That expence laid out upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubject, ought to be a burden upon the benefit procured. And this rule will hold even againſt the diſſent of any of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; for they cannot in conſcience take the benefit without the burden. A diſſent cannot have any effect in equity, but only to free the perſon diſſenting from any riſk.</p>
                        <p>The following caſes, being of the ſame kind with that above ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, come clearly under the general rule. One of three joint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of a mill, having raiſed a declarator of thirlage, and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a diſclamation by the others, having inſiſted in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs till he obtained a decree; the others who reaped the profit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with him, were made liable for their ſhare of the expence <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, January 6. 1676, Forbes contra Roſs.</note>. And one of many co-creditors having obtained a judgement againſt the debtor's relict, finding her liable to pay her huſband's debts; the other creditors who ſhared the benefit were decreed to contribute to the expence <note n="†" place="bottom">Bruce, July 30. 1715, Creditors of Calderwood contra Borthwick.</note>. For the ſame reaſon, where a tenement deſtroyed

by fire was rebuilt by a liferenter, the proprietor, after the liferenter's death, was made liable for the expence of rebuilding, as far as he was <hi>lucratus</hi> thereby <note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes, Feb. 20. 1706, Halliday contra Garden.</note>. And if rebuilt by the proprietor, the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renter will be liable for the intereſt of the ſum expended as far as he is <hi>lucratus</hi> 
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, Jan. 24. 1672, Haket contra Watt.</note>. Action was ſuſtained at the inſtance of a wadſetter for declaring, that his intended reparation of a harbour in the wadſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, would be profitable to the reverſer; and that the reverſer, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on redemption, ſhould be bound to repay the expence thereof <note n="‡" place="bottom">Durie, July 22. 1626, Moriſon contra Earl of Lothian.</note>. Upon the ſame principle, if a leſſee erect any buildings by which the proprietor is evidently <hi>lucratus</hi> at the end of the leaſe, there is a claim in equity for the expence of the meliorations. But reparations, though extenſive, will ſcarce be allowed where the leſſee is bound to uphold the houſes; becauſe a leſſee who beſtows ſuch reparation without his landlord's conſent, is underſtood to lay out his money in order to fulfil his obligation, without any proſpect of retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="‖" place="bottom">Gilmour, Feb. 1664, Hodge contra Brown.</note>. The preſent miniſter was found not liable for the meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the glebe made by his predeceſſor <note n="**" place="bottom">Nicolſon, (Kirkmen), June 14. 1623, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar contra Hay.</note>. But what if meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be made, incloſing, draining, ſtoning, &amp;c. which are clearly profitable to all future poſſeſſors? If the expence of theſe, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the benefit, be not in ſome way refunded, glebes will reſt in their original ſtate for ever. I do not ſay, that the miniſter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſucceeding ought to be liable for the whole of this expence: for as the benefit is ſuppoſed to be perpetual, the burden ought to be equally ſo: which ſuggeſts the following opinion, That the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>total of the expence ought to be converted into a perpetual annuity, to be paid by the miniſters of this pariſh; for the only equitable method is, to make each contribute in proportion to the benefit he receives.</p>
                        <p>The following caſe belongs undoubtedly to the maxim of equity under conſideration; and yet was judged by common law, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the equitable remedy. In a ſhipwreck, part of the cargo being fiſhed out of the ſea and ſaved, was delivered to the owners for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſalvage. The proprietor of the ſhip claiming the freight of the goods ſaved, <hi>pro rata itineris,</hi> the freighters admitted the claim; but inſiſted, that as the ſalvage was beneficial to him on account of his freight, as well as to them on account of their goods, he ought
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0743600300:120"/>
to pay a proportion of the ſalvage. His anſwer was ſuſtained to free him from any part, <hi>viz.</hi> That the expence was wholly laid out on recovering the freighter's goods; and therefore that they only ought to be liable <note n="*" place="bottom">January 18. 1735, Lutwich contra Gray.</note>. The anſwer here ſuſtained reſolves into the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſition, That he only is liable whoſe benefit is intended: which is certainly not good in equity; for at that rate, the <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor,</hi> who in meliorating the ſubject intends his own benefit ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, has no claim againſt the proprietor. Here the freighters and the proprietor of the ſhip were connected by a common intereſt: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the goods from ſhipwreck was beneficial to both parties; to the freighters, becauſe it put them again in poſſeſſion of their goods; and to the proprietor of the ſhip, becauſe it gave him a claim for freight. The ſalvage accordingly was truly <hi>in rem verſum</hi> of both; and for that reaſon ought to be paid by both in proportion to the benefit received. This caſe may be conſidered in a different light that will ſcarce admit a diſpute. Suppoſe that the owners of the cargo, in recovering their goods to the extent of L. 1000, have laid out L. 100 upon ſalvage: they have in effect ſaved or recovered but L. 900; and beyond that ſum they cannot be liable for the freight: which in numbers will bring out a greater ſum than what reſults from the rule above mentioned.</p>
                        <p>It will not eſcape the reader, that equity is further extended in this branch than in the former; and he will alſo diſcover a ſolid reaſon for the difference. With reſpect to matters contained in the former branch, the real connection is only, that what is loſt by the one is gained by the other; as in the caſe of a <hi>bona fide poſſeſſor rei alienae.</hi> But the real connection of matters in the preſent branch is ſo far more intimate, that every acquiſition muſt benefit all equally, and every loſs burden all equally.</p>
                        <p>It appears, that a benefit accruing to another by my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, occaſionally only not neceſſarily, will not intitle me to a claim where I am not a loſer. To make the truth of this obſervation evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, a few examples will be ſufficient. A drain made by me in my own ground for my own behoof, happens to diſcharge a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of water that ſtagnated in a ſuperior field belonging to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Juſtice does not intitle me to claim from this neighbour any ſhare of the expence laid out upon the drain. The drain has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my intention, and overpays the ſum beſtowed upon it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my caſe comes not under the maxim, <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura.</hi> Neither can I have any claim upon the rule, That
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0743600300:121"/>
expence laid out upon a common ſubject ought to be a burden upon the benefit procured; for here there is no common ſubject, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly another perſon accidentally or occaſionally benefited by an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intended ſolely for my own benefit. And Providence has wiſely ordered that ſuch a claim ſhould have no ſupport from the moral ſenſe; for as there can be no preciſe rule for eſtimating the benefit that each of us receives from the drain, the ſubjecting my neighbour to a claim would tend to create endleſs diſputes between us. For the ſame reaſon, if my neighbour in making an incloſure take advantage of a march-ſence built by me, he will not be liable to any part of the expence beſtowed by me upon it; becauſe the benefit, as in the former caſe, is occaſional only or conſequential.</p>
                        <p>From the nature of the claim handled in the preſent branch, it follows, that if the party againſt whom the claim is laid, renounce the benefit, he cannot be ſubjected to the burden.</p>
                        <p>With reſpect to the branch now handled, the circumſtance that the benefit accruing to another was occaſioned by my means, is the connection that intitles me to a proportion of the ſum I laid out in procuring that benefit. But with reſpect to the ſecond branch, which we are next to enter upon, it muſt require ſome perſonal relation extremely intimate to intitle me to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of another man's profit when I have not contributed to it. And this will be made evident by the following examples.</p>
                        <p>When land is held ward, and the ſuperior is under age, a gift of his ward is effectual againſt his vaſſal as well as againſt himſelf. But where the gift of ward was taken for behoof of the ſuperior, it was the opinion of the court, that the vaſſal alſo had the benefit thereof upon paying his proportion of the compoſition <note n="*" place="bottom">Dirleton, December 1. 1676, Grierſon contra Ragg.</note>. Againſt this opinion it was urged, That a vaſſal muſt lay his account with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liable to all the caſualties ariſing from the nature of his right; and that there was no reaſon for limiting the ſuperior's claim, more than that of any other donatar. But it was anſwered, That the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between ſuperior and vaſſal is ſuch, as that the ſuperior cannot <hi>bona ſide</hi> take advantage againſt his vaſſal of a caſualty occaſioned by his own minority. The ſame rule was applied to a gift of marriage taken for behoof of the ſuperior <note n="†" place="bottom">Harcaſe, (Ward and Marriage), Jan. 1686, Drummelzier contra Murray of Stanhope.</note>. And it appearing that the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior had obtained this gift for alledged good ſervices, without paying any compoſition, the benefit was communicated to the vaſſal without obliging him to pay any ſum <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0743600300:122"/>
If a purchaſer of land, diſcovering a defect in the title derived to him from his author, ſecure himſelf by acquiring the preferable title, the common law will not permit him to found upon this new acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red title as a ground of eviction, to make his author, bound in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute warrandice, liable for the value of the ſubject: for the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer is not intitled to the value unleſs the land be actually evicted from him; and, as the caſe now ſtands, the purchaſer cannot have any claim upon the warrandice beyond the ſum he paid for the title. This point is ſtill more clear upon the principle of equity above mentioned. The connection is ſo intimate between a purchaſer, and a vender bound in abſolute warrandice, that every tranſaction made by either, with relation to the ſubject purchaſed, is deemed to be for behoof of both.</p>
                        <p>But now ſuppoſing ſeveral parcels of land to be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one title-deed. One parcel is ſold with abſolute warrandice; and the purchaſer, diſcovering the title-deed to be imperfect, acquires from a third party a preferable title to the whole parcels. He is no doubt bound to communicate the benefit of this acquiſition to the vender, as far as regards the parcel he purchaſed. But there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at common law to bar him from evicting the other parcels from the vender. Whether a relief can be afforded in equity, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The connection between the parties is pretty intimate: the purchaſer is bound to communicate to the vender the benefit of his acquiſition with reſpect to one parcel, and it is natural to extend the ſame remedy to the whole. One caſe of this nature occurred in the court of ſeſſion. A man having right to ſeveral ſubjects contained in an adjudication, ſold one of them with abſolute warrandice; and the purchaſer having acquired a title preferable to his author's adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, claimed the ſubjects that were not diſponed to him. The court reſtricted the claim to the ſum paid for the preferable title <note n="*" place="bottom">February 21. 1741. James Drummond contra Brown and Miln.</note>. It is not certain whether this decree was laid upon the principle above mentioned: for what moved ſome of the judges was the danger of permitting a purchaſer acquainted with the title-deeds of his author, to take advantage of his knowledge by picking up preferable titles; and that this, as an unfair practice, ought to be prohibited.</p>

management, and where ruin muſt enſue, if no perſon actuated with the principle of benevolence be moved to interpoſe. Here friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and good-will have a favourable opportunity to exert themſelves, and to do much good, perhaps without any extraordinary labour or great expence. But there can be no management without labour and expence more or leſs; and when a proprietor is benefited by ſuch acts of friendſhip or benevolence, juſtice and gratitude claim from the proprietor a retribution, to the extent at leaſt of the benefit received. Here the maxim <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura,</hi> is applicable in the ſtricteſt ſenſe. Hence the <hi>actio negotiorum geſtorum</hi> in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man law, which for the reaſon given is adopted by all civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>But what if this friendly man, after beſtowing his money and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with the utmoſt precaution, happen to be unſucceſsful? What if, after laying out his money profitably upon repairing houſes, or purchaſing cattle for my uſe, the benefit be loſt to me by the caſual deſtruction of the ſubject? would it be juſt that this friend, who had no view but for my intereſt, ſhould run the riſk? As there was no contract between us, a claim will not be ſuſtained at common law for the money expended. But equity pierces deeper into the nature of things, in order to fulfil the rules of juſtice. Service undertaken by a friend upon an urgent occaſion, advances gratitude from a virtue to be a duty; and binds me to <hi>recompenſe</hi> my friend as far as he has laid out his own money in order to do me ſervice. The moral ſenſe teaches this leſſon; and no perſon, however partial in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, but muſt perceive this to be the duty of others. Utility alſo joins with juſtice in ſupport of this claim of recompence. Men ought to be invited to ſerve a friend in time of need: but inſtead of invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would be a great diſcouragement, if the money advanced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch ſervice were upon their own riſk, even when laid out with the greateſt prudence <note n="a" place="bottom">The Roman writers found this duty upon their <hi>quaſi</hi>-contracts, of which <hi>negotiorum geſtio</hi> is ſaid to be one. And to underſtand this foundation, the nature of <hi>quaſi</hi>-contracts muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. In human affairs certain circumſtances and ſituations frequently happen that require a covenant, which nothing could prevent but want of opportunity. The preſent caſe affords a good illuſtration. A ſudden call forces me abroad, without having time to regulate my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: diſorder enſues, and a friend undertakes the management. Here nothing prevents a mandate but want of opportunity; and it is preſumed that the mandate would not have been wanting, had I known the good intentions of my friend. Equity accordingly holds the mandate as granted, and gives the ſame actions to both that the common law gives in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of a mandate. Though this ſerves to explain the Roman <hi>quaſi</hi>-contracts, yet it ſeems a wide ſtretch in equity to give to a ſuppoſition the effects of a real contract; eſpecially without any evidence that the perſon who undertakes the management would have been my choice. But I have endeavoured to make out in the text, that this claim for recompence has a ſolid foundation in juſtice, and in human nature, without neceſſity of recurring to the ſtrained ſuppoſition of a contract.</note>. This doctrine is laid down by Ulpian in clear terms: <q rend="inline">"Is autem, qui negotiorum geſtorum agit, non ſolum ſi effectum habuit negotium quod geſſit, actione ita utetur: ſed ſufficit, ſi utiliter geſſit, etſi effectum non habuit negotium.

                        </p>
                        <p>From what is ſaid above it is evident, that the man who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes my affairs, not to ſerve me, but to ſerve himſelf, is not intitled to the <hi>actio negotiorum geſtorum.</hi> Nor even, ſuppoſing me to be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by his management, is he intitled to have his loſs repaired out of my gain: for wrong can never found any claim in equity. Yet Julianus, the moſt acute of the Roman writers, anſwers the queſtion in the affirmative. Treating of one who <hi>mala ſide</hi> meddles in my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he gives the following opinion: <q rend="inline">"Ipſe tamen, ſi circa res meas aliquid impenderit, non in id quod ei abeſt, quia improbe ad nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia mea acceſſit, ſed in quod ego locupletior factus ſum, habet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra me actionem <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 6. § 3. De negot. geſt.</note>."</q> It appears at the ſame time, from <hi>l. ult. C. De negot. geſt.</hi> that this author was of a different opinion, where the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of a man's affairs was continued againſt his will; for there no action was given. This, in my apprehenſion, is eſtabliſhing a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction without a difference: for no man can hope for my conſent to continue the management of my affairs, when he begun that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, not to ſerve me, but with a view to his own intereſt. A prohibition involved in the nature of the thing, is equivalent to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs prohibition.</p>
                        <p>The maſter of a ſhip, or any other, who ranſoms the cargo from a privateer, is, according to the doctrine above laid down, intitled to claim from the owners of the cargo the ſum laid out upon their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: they profit by the tranſaction, and they ought to indemnify him. But what if the cargo be afterward loſt in a ſtorm at ſea, or by robbery at land? The owners are not now profiters by the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and therefore they cannot be made liable upon the maxim, <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura.</hi> They are however liable upon the principle here explained. The moment the tranſaction was finiſhed they became debtors to the ranſomer for the ſum he laid out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably upon their account. He did not undertake the riſk of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0743600300:125"/>
cargo ranſomed; and therefore the caſual loſs of the cargo cannot have the effect to deprive him of his claim.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>lex Rhodia de jactu,</hi> a celebrated maritime regulation, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among all civilized nations ancient and modern. When in a ſtorm weighty goods of little value are thrown overboard to diſburden the ſhip, the owners of the remaining cargo muſt contribute to make up the loſs. This caſe, as to the obligation of retribution, is of the ſame nature with that now mentioned, and depends on the ſame principle. The throwing overboard weighty goods of little value, is extremely beneficial to the owners of the more precious goods, which by that means are preſerved; and, according to the foregoing doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, theſe owners ought to contribute for making up the loſs of the goods thrown into the ſea, preciſely as if there had been a formal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to that effect. But what if the whole cargo be afterward loſt, by which eventually there is no benefit? If loſt at ſea in the ſame voyage, the owner of the goods thrown overboard has certainly no claim, becauſe at any rate he would have loſt his goods along with the reſt of the cargo. But as ſoon as the cargo is laid upon land, the obligation for retribution is purified; the value of the goods aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to the ſea, is or ought to be in the pocket of the owner; and the delay of payment will not afford a defence againſt him, whatever become of the cargo after it is landed.</p>
                        <p>It is a queſtion of greater intricacy, Whether the goods ſaved from the ſea ought to contribute according to their weight or according to their value. The latter rule is eſpouſed in the Roman law: <q rend="inline">"Cum in eadem nave varia mercium genera complures mercatores coegiſſent, praetereaque multi vectores, ſervi liberique in ea navigarent, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtate gravi orta, neceſſario jactura facta erat. Quaeſita deinde ſunt haec: An omnes jacturam praeſtare oporteat, et ſi qui tales merces impoſuiſſent, quibus navis non oneraretur, velut gemmas, margaritas? et quae portio praeſtanda eſt? Et an etiam pro liberis capitibus dari oporteat? Et qua actione ea res expediri poſſit? Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, omnes, quorum interfuiſſet jacturam fieri, conferre oportere, quia id tributum obſervatae res deberent: itaque dominum etiam navis pro portione obligatum eſſe. Jacturae ſummam pro rerum pretio diſtribui oportet. Corporum liberorum aeſtimationem nullam fieri poſſe <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 2. § 2. De lege Rhodia de jactu.</note>."</q> This rule is adopted by all the commercial nations in Europe, without a ſingle exception, as far as I can learn. And in purſuance of the rule, a doctrine begins to reliſh with judges, That the owner of the ſhip ought to contribute, becauſe' by throwing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0743600300:126"/>
the goods in queſtion, which prevented a ſhipwreck, his claim for freight is preſerved to him. Thus, if, in ſtreſs of weather, or in danger and juſt fear of an enemy, goods be thrown overboard, in order to ſave the ſhip and the reſt of the cargo, that which is ſaved ſhall contribute to repair that which is loſt, and the owners of the ſhip ſhall contribute in proportion <note n="*" place="bottom">Shower's caſes in parliament 19.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Theſe authorities notwithſtanding, to which, I am ſenſible, great regard is juſtly due, it is not in my power to baniſh an impreſſion I have, That the rule of contribution ought to be weight, not value; and whether, after all, the impreſſion ought to be baniſhed, muſt be decided by reaſon, not authority. In every caſe where a man gives away his money or his goods for behoof of a plurality connected by a common intereſt, two things are evident: firſt, That his equitable claim for a recompence cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the loſs he has ſuſtained; and next, That each individual is liable to make up the loſs of that part which was given away on his account. When a ranſom is paid to a privateer for the ſhip and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, a ſhare of the money is underſtood to be advanced for each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, in proportion to the value of his goods; and that ſhare he muſt contribute, being laid out upon his account, or for his ſervice. That the ſame rule is applicable where a ſhip is ſaved by abandoning part of its cargo, is far from being clear. Let us examine the matter attentively, ſtep by ſtep. The cargo in a violent ſtorm is found too weighty for the ſhip, which muſt be diſburdened of part, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the one half. In what manner is this to be done? The anſwer would be eaſy, were there leiſure and opportunity for a regular ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: each perſon who has the weight of a pound aboard, ought to throw the half into the ſea; for in ſtrict juſtice one perſon is not bound to abandon a greater proportion than another. This method, however, is ſeldom or never practicable; becauſe in a hurry the goods at hand muſt be heaved over: and were it practicable, it would not be for the common intereſt, to abandon goods of little weight and great value, along with goods of great weight and little value. Hence it comes to be the common intereſt, and, without aſking queſtions, the common practice, to abandon goods the value of which bears no proportion to their weight. This, as being done for the common intereſt, intitles the proprietor of theſe goods to a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence from thoſe for whoſe ſervice the goods were abandoned. Now the ſervice done to each proprietor is, inſtead of his valuable goods, to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0743600300:127"/>
have others thrown overboard of a meaner quality; and for ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice all the recompence that can be juſtly claimed is the value of the goods thrown overboard. Let us ſuppoſe with reſpect to any owner in particular, that regularly he was bound to throw overboard twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ounces of his goods: all that he is bound to contribute, is the value of twenty ounces of the goods that in place of his own were actually thrown overboard. In a word, this ſhort-hand way of throwing into the ſea the leaſt valuable goods, appears to me in the ſame light, as if the ſeveral owners of the more valuable part of the cargo, had each of them purchaſed a quantity of the mean goods to be thrown into the ſea inſtead of their own.</p>
                        <p>I cannot help at the ſame time obſerving, that the doctrine of the Roman law appears very uncouth in ſome of its conſequences. Jewels, and I may add bank-bills, are made to contribute to make up the loſs, though they contribute not in any degree to the diſtreſs; nor is a ſingle ounce thrown overboard upon their account: nay, the ſhip it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is made to contribute, though the <hi>jactura</hi> is made neceſſary, not by the weight of the ſhip, but by that of the cargo. On the other hand, paſſengers are exempted altogether from contributing, for a very whimſical reaſon, That the value of a free man cannot be eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in money: and yet paſſengers frequently make a great part of the load. If they contribute to the neceſſity of diſburdening the ſhip, for what good reaſon ought they to be exempted from contributing to make up the loſs of the goods which were thrown into the ſea upon their account?</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Powers of a court of equity to remedy what is imperſect in common law, with reſpect to deeds and covenants.</head>
                  <p>WE have ſeen above, that, abſtracting from a poſitive engagement, the virtue of benevolence is not a duty, except to relieve others from harm. But a man ſingly is the moſt helpleſs of all animals; and unleſs he could rely upon ſupport from others, he would in vain attempt any operation that requires more than two hands. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſociety by ſecuring aid and aſſiſtance in time of need, promiſes and covenants are provided by nature; and to theſe accordingly may juſtly be attributed, the progreſs at leaſt, if not the commencement of every art and manufacture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0743600300:128"/>
Every promiſe and covenant implies neceſſarily two perſons: one who is bound, termed the <hi>obligor;</hi> and one to whom the obligation is directed, termed the <hi>obligee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That particular act of the will which binds us whether in promiſing or in contracting, is termed <hi>conſent.</hi> And it is alſo that very act which makes a deed effectual; as will thus appear. A deed is of two kinds: one where the granter binds himſelf, as in a diſpoſition, or in a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which being in effect a promiſe, is obviouſly binding upon him by his conſent: the other kind is where the granter declares his will without being bound, as where by a deed he impoſes burdens upon his heir: it is the heir's conſent which binds him in that caſe, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent implied from his taking up the ſucceſſion.</p>
                  <p>Few perſons paſs much of their time without having purpoſes to fulfil and plans to execute, for the accompliſhing of which means are employ'd. Among theſe means deeds and covenants make a capital figure: no man binds himſelf or others for the ſake merely of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but in order to bring about a deſired event. And therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed and covenant may juſtly be conſidered to be a mean employ'd to bring about ſome end or event.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the deſired event is mentioned in the deed or contract, and expreſly agreed on or appointed to be performed; in which caſe performance concludes the tranſaction, becauſe it brings to a final iſſue all that was intended by the parties concerned. A bond for bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed money is a proper example: what is ſtipulated in the bond to be performed is repayment of the money, beyond which the parties have no view; and that end is fully accompliſhed when the money is paid. A legacy bequeathed in a teſtament is another example of the ſame kind: payment of the legacy is the only end in view; and that end is accompliſhed when the legatee receives the money. But in many deeds and contracts there is a further end in view than merely the performance of what is agreed or appointed. Thus when I buy a horſe with a view to propagation, the contract is performed upon delivery of the horſe to me. But this performance is not ſufficient to fulfil my purpoſe: I had a further end in view, which was to breed horſes; and unleſs the horſe be fit for that end, my purpoſe in contracting is fruſtrated. I purchaſe a hogſhead of flax-ſeed for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a crop of flax. It is not enough that the ſeed be delivered to me: if it be rotten, the end I had in view is diſappointed.</p>
                  <p>This ſuggeſts a diviſion of deeds and contracts into two kinds. A deed of the firſt kind is where the performance of what is appointed fulfils the intention of the granter: and of the ſecond kind, where
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0743600300:129"/>
that performance is intended as a mean only to a further end, which in that reſpect may be termed <hi>ultimate.</hi> In like manner, a contract of the firſt kind is where the performance ſtipulated is ultimate, by fulfilling what was intended by the parties: of the ſecond kind, where that performance is intended as a mean only to an ultimate end. In this laſt kind, the contract is a mean to bring about the immediate end of performing what was ſtipulated; and this immediate end is a mean to bring about the ultimate end.</p>
                  <p>In contracts where the peformance of what is ſtipulated is a mean only to an ultimate end, there is place for judging how far the means are proportioned to the end: they may be inſufficient to bring about the end: they may be more than ſufficient: and they may have no tendency to bring about the end. In caſes of this nature there is place for the interpoſition of equity, to vary theſe means in ſome caſes, ſo as to proportion them more accurately to the ultimate end; and in other caſes to ſet aſide the contract altogether, as inſufficient to bring about the ultimate end. Hence it is that ſuch contracts are termed <hi>Contracts bonae fidei;</hi> that is, contracts in which equity may interpoſe to correct inequalities, and to adjuſt all matters according to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intention of the parties. With reſpect to contracts where the performance ſtipulated is the ultimate end, there is evidently no place for the interpoſition of equity; for what defence can a man have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law or in equity againſt performing his engagement, when it fulfils all he had in view in contracting? Hence it is, that contracts of this kind are termed <hi>Contracts ſtricti juris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the noted diſtinction between contracts <hi>bonae fidei</hi> and <hi>ſtricti juris,</hi> great attention is given in the Roman law. We are told, that equity may interpoſe in the former, and that the latter are left to common law. But as to what contracts are <hi>bonae fidei,</hi> and what <hi>ſtricti juris,</hi> we are left in the dark by Roman writers. Some of their commentators indeed give us liſts or catalogues; but they pretend not to lay down any rule by which the one kind may be diſtinguiſhed from the other. I have endeavoured to ſupply that defect: it belongs to others to judge whether my endeavours have been ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>To prevent miſtakes in the application of the foregoing doctrine, it is neceſſary to be obſerved, that the end here underſtood is not that which may be ſecretly in view of the one or the other party, but that which is ſpoke out, or underſtood by the parties concerned; for a thought retained within the mind, cannot have the effect to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy an obligation more than to create it. The overlooking this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0743600300:130"/>
has led Puffendorff into a groſs error: who puts the caſe <note n="*" place="bottom">lib. 3. cap. 6. § 7.</note>, That a man, upon a falſe report of all his horſes being deſtroy'd, makes a contract for a new cargo; and his opinion is, That in equity the purchaſer is not bound. This opinion favours too much of a college, and of a man unacquainted with the world and its commerce. Were miſtakes of this kind indulged with a remedy, there would be no end of law-ſuits. At this rate, if I purchaſe a quantity of body or table linen, ignorant at the time of a legacy left me of ſuch goods, I ought to be relieved in equity againſt the purchaſe, having now no occaſion for theſe goods. And for the ſame reaſon, if I purchaſe a horſe by commiſſion for a friend, who happens to be dead at the time of the purchaſe; there muſt be a relief in equity, though I made the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in my own name. But there is no foundation for this opinion in equity more than at common law. If a ſubject anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which it is purchaſed, the vender has no farther concern: he is intitled upon delivery to demand the price, without regarding any private or extrinſic motive that might have led his party to make the purchaſe. In general, a man who expoſes his goods to ſale muſt anſwer for their ſufficiency; becauſe there is no obligation in equity to pay a price for goods that anſwer not the purpoſe for which they are ſold by the one, and bought by the other: but if a purchaſer be led into an error or miſtake that regards not the ſubject nor the vender, the conſequences muſt reſt upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add upon this general head, that the end propoſed to be brought about by a deed or covenant ought to be lawful; for to make effectual an unlawful act is inconſiſtent with the very nature of a court of law. Thus a bond granted by a woman, binding her to pay a ſum if ſhe ſhould marry, is unlawful, as tending to bar popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore will be rejected even by a court of common law. And the ſame fate will attend every obligation granted <hi>ob turpem cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam;</hi> a bond, for example, granted to a woman as a bribe to commit adultery or fornication. So far there is no occaſion for a court of equity.</p>
                  <p>This chapter, conſiſting of a multitude of parts, requires many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; and in the diviſions that follow perſpicuity is ſtudied, which ought to be the chief object in every arrangement.</p>

                     <head>SECT. I. Where the words expreſſing will or conſent are imperfect.</head>
                     <p>IN applying the rules of equity to deeds and covenants, what firſt paſſes under examination is, Whether the will or conſent be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or fairly taken down in the writing. A man, expreſſing even his own thoughts, is not always happy in his terms: errors may creep in, which are multiplied when improper words are uſed in writing. Thus clauſes in writings are ſometimes ambiguous or obſcure, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too limited, and ſometimes too extenſive. As common law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no remedy, the imperfection is ſupplied by a court of equity. It admits words and writing to be indeed the proper evidence of will; but it does not exclude other evidence. Senſible that words and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting are ſometimes erroneous, it endeavours if poſſible to reach will, which is the only ſubſtantial part; and if, from the end and purpoſe of the engagement, from collateral circumſtances, or other ſatisfying evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the will can be aſcertained, it is juſtly made the rule of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſole purpoſe of words is to bear teſtimony of will; and if their teſtimony be falſe, they are juſtly diſregarded. This branch of equitable juriſdiction, which obviouſly reaches ſingle deeds as well as covenants, is founded on the principle of juſtice; becauſe every man feels himſelf bound by the conſent he really interpoſed, without relation to words or writing, which ſtand for evidence only.</p>
                     <p>This ſection may be diſtinguiſhed into three articles. 1ſt, Where the words leave us uncertain about will. 2d, Where they fall ſhort of will. And, 3d, Where they go beyond it.</p>

                           <hi>ART. I.</hi> Where the words leave us uncertain about will.</head>
                        <p>THIS imperfection may be occaſioned by the fault of the writer in uſing improper terms; or by the fault of the parties, whether by willing indiſtinctly, or by expreſſing their will obſcurely. But I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely have neglected this diſtinction, becauſe in moſt of the caſes that occur, it is extremely doubtful upon whom the imperfection is to be charged. Nor will this breed the leaſt confuſion or intricacy; for whatever occaſions the <hi>quaeſtio voluntatis,</hi> there is but one method for aſcertaining it; and that is, from the nature of the deed or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0743600300:132"/>
and from concomitant circumſtances, to form the moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conjecture what truly is the will.</p>
                        <p>A wife gives a ſecurity upon her eſtate to her huſband's creditors; but with what intention is not ſpecified. If a donation was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe has no claim againſt her huſband: but <hi>in dubio,</hi> a cautionary engagement muſt be preſumed, which will afford her a claim for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, January 11. 1679, Bowie contra Corbet. Fountainhall, July 16. 1696, Leiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man contra Nicols. November 29. 1728, Trail of Sabae contra Moodie.</note>. Though in general the intention muſt firſt be aſcertained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be pronounced what is to follow from it; yet it is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that a court of common law would hardly be brought to ſuſtain a claim of this nature, where there is no clauſe in the deed upon which it can be founded.</p>
                        <p>Where a man provides a ſum to his creditor, without declaring it to be in ſatisfaction, this ſum will be ſuſtained as a ſeparate claim at common law. But as the granter probably intended that ſum to be in ſatisfaction, according to the principle <hi>Quod debitor non praeſumitur donare,</hi> a court of equity, ſupplying the defect of words, decrees the ſum to be in ſatisfaction. Thus, a man being bound for L. 10 year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his daughter, gave her at her marriage a portion of L. 200. Decreed, That the annuity ſhould be included in the portion <note n="†" place="bottom">Tothill's reports, 78.</note>. But where a man leaves a legacy to his creditor, this cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed as ſatisfaction; for in that caſe it would not be a legacy or donation.</p>
                        <p>Anthony Murray, <hi>anno</hi> 1738, made a ſettlement of his eſtate upon John and Thomas Belſcheſes, taking them bound, among other lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to pay L. 300 Sterling to their ſiſter Emilia at her marriage. Anthony altered this ſettlement <hi>anno</hi> 1740, in favour of his heir at law; obliging him, however, to pay the legacies contained in the former ſettlement. In the year 1744, Anthony executed a bond to Emilia upon the narrative of love and favour, binding himſelf to pay to her in liferent, and to her children <hi>nati et naſcituri</hi> in fee, at the firſt term after his deceaſe, the ſum of L. 1200 Sterling. The doubt was, whether both ſums were due to Emilia, or only the latter. It was admitted, that both ſums would be due at common law, which looks no farther than the words: but that this was not the intention of the granter, was urged from the following circumſtance, That in the bond for the L. 1200 there is no mention made of the former le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, nor of any legacy, which clearly ſhews that Anthony had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0743600300:133"/>
the firſt legacy; and conſequently that he intended no more for Emilia but L. 1200 in whole. Which was accordingly decreed <note n="*" place="bottom">December 22. 1752, Emilia Belſches and her huſband contra Sir Patrick Murray.</note>.</p>

                           <hi>ART. II.</hi> Where the words fall ſhort of will.</head>
                        <p>IN England where eſtates are ſettled by will, it is the practice to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any defect in the words, in order to ſupport the will of the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. But then it is a rule, That the will muſt be clearly aſcertained; for otherwiſe the court may be in hazard of forfeiting the heir at law, contrary to the will of his anceſtor. Thus where a man deviſes land to his heir after the death of his wife, this is a good deviſe to the wife for life by neceſſary implication: for by the words of the will, the heir is not to have it during her life: and if ſhe have it not, none elſe can; for the executors cannot intermeddle <note n="†" place="bottom">New Abridg. of the law, vol. 2. p. 66.</note>. But if a man deviſe his land to a ſtranger after the death of his wife, this does not neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that the wife ſhould have the eſtate for life: it is but declaring at what time the ſtranger's eſtate ſhall commence; and in the mean time the heir ſhall have the<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> land.<note n="a" place="bottom">
                              <hi>N. B.</hi> This is a proper example of a maxim in the Roman law, <hi>Poſitus in conditione, non cenſetur poſitus in inſtitutione.</hi>
                           </note> An executor being named with the uſual power of intermeddling with the whole money and effects of the deceaſed, the following clauſe ſubjoined, <q rend="inline">"And I hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar and ſeclude all others from any right or intereſt in my ſaid executry,"</q> was held by the court to import an univerſal legacy in favour of the executor <note n="‖" place="bottom">February 1. 1739, John Beizly contra Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel Napier.</note>. A man having two nephews who were his heirs at law, made a ſettlement in their favour, dividing his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular farms between them, intending probably an equal diviſion. But in the enumeration of the particular lands, a farm was left out by the omiſſion of the clerk, which, as the ſcrivener ſwore, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the plaintiff. The court conſidering that the ſettlement was voluntary or gratuitous, refuſed to amend the miſtake, leaving the farm to deſcend equally between the nephews <note n="**" place="bottom">1. Vernon 37.</note>. For here it was not clear that the maker of the deed intended an equal diviſion.</p>
                        <p>In the caſes above mentioned, writing indeed is neceſſary as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but not as an eſſential ſolemnity: it is of no conſequence what words be uſed in the ſettlement of a land-eſtate, or in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of an executor, provided the will of the maker be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcertained. But in ſeveral tranſactions, writing not only ſtands
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0743600300:134"/>
for evidence, but is beſide an indiſpenſable ſolemnity. Land cannot be convey'd without a procuratory or a precept, which muſt be in a ſet form of words. A man may lend his money upon a verbal pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he cannot proceed directly to execution, unleſs he have a formal bond containing a clauſe of regiſtration authoriſing execution. Neither can ſuch a bond be convey'd to a purchaſer, otherwiſe than by a formal aſſignment in writing. Here a new ſpeculation ariſes, What power a court of equity hath over a writing of this kind. In this writing not leſs than in others, the words may happen erroneouſly to be more extenſive than the will of the granter; or they may happen to be more limited. Muſt the words in all caſes be the ſovereign rule? By no means. Though in certain tranſactions writ is an eſſential ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, it follows not that the words ſolely muſt be regarded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to will; for to bind a man by words where he hath not interpoſed his conſent, is contradictory to the moſt obvious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of juſtice. Hence it neceſſarily follows, that a deed of this kind may, by a court of equity, be limited to a narrower effect than the words naturally import; and that this ought to be done, when from the context, from the intendment of the deed, or from other convincing circumſtances, it can be certainly gathered, that the words by miſtake go beyond the will. But though in ordinary caſes, ſuch as thoſe above mentioned, the defect of words may be ſupplied, and force given to will, ſuppoſing it clearly aſcertained, yet this cannot be done in a deed to which writ is eſſential. The reaſon is, that to make writ an eſſential ſolemnity, is in other words to declare, That action muſt not be ſuſtained except as far as authoriſed by writ. However clear therefore will may be, a court of equity hath not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſuſtain action upon it, independent of the words where theſe are made eſſential; for this, in effect, would be to overturn the law, which is beyond the power of equity. A caſe that really happened is a notable illuſtration of this doctrine. A bond of corroboration granted by the debtor with a cautioner was of the following tenor. <q rend="inline">"And ſeeing the foreſaid principal ſum of 1000 merks, and intereſt ſince Martinmas 1742, are reſting unpaid; and that A the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is willing to ſuperſede payment till the term after mentioned upon B the debtor's granting the preſent corroborative ſecurity with C his cautioner; therefore B and C bind and oblige them, conjunctly and ſeverally, &amp;c. to content and pay to A in liferent, and to her children in fee, equally among them, and failing any of them by deceaſe, to the ſurvivors, their heirs or aſſignees, in fee, and that at Whitſunday 1744, with 200 merks of penalty, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0743600300:135"/>
with the due and ordinary annualrent of the ſaid principal ſum from the ſaid term of Martinmas 1742,"</q> &amp;c. Here the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory clauſe is imperfect, as it omits to mention the principal ſum corroborated, <hi>viz.</hi> the 1000 merks, but only the intereſt, a pure over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the writer. In a ſuit upon this bond of corroboration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the heir of the cautioner, it was objected, That upon this bond no action could lie for payment of the principal ſum. It was obvious to the court, that the bond in queſtion, though defective in the moſt eſſential part, afforded however clear evidence of C's conſent to be bound as cautioner. But then it occurred, that a cautionary engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is one of thoſe deeds that require writing, not only in point of evidence, but alſo in point of ſolemnity. A formal bond of corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration fulfils the law in both points. But a defective bond, like the preſent, whatever evidence it may afford, is as nothing in point of ſolemnity: it is ſtill leſs formal than if it wanted any of the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of the act 1681. Action accordingly was denied; for action cannot be ſuſtained upon conſent alone where a formal deed is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <note n="*" place="bottom">June 2. 1749, Colt contra Angus.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The following caſe concerning a regiſtrable bond, or, as termed in England, a bond in judgment, is another inſtance of refuſing to ſupply a defect in words. A bond for a ſum of money bore the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing clauſe, <hi>with intereſt and penalty,</hi> without ſpecifying any ſum in name of penalty. The creditor moved the court to ſupply the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by naming the fifth part of the principal ſum, being the conſtant rule as to conſenſual penalties. There could be no doubt of the granter's intention; and yet the court juſtly thought that they had not power to ſupply the defect <note n="†" place="bottom">Fountainhall, January 6. 1705, Leſlie contra Ogilvie.</note>.</p>
                        <p>But though a defect in a writ that is eſſential in point of ſolemnity, cannot be ſupplied ſo as to give it the full effect that law gives to ſuch a deed, it may notwithſtanding be regarded by a court of equity in point of evidence. A bond of borrowed money, for example, null by the act 1681, becauſe the writer's name is neglected, may, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with other evidence, be produced in an action for payment, in order to prove delivery of the money as a loan, and conſequently to found a decree for repayment.</p>
                        <p>Walter Riddel, in his contract of marriage 1694, became bound to ſecure his whole land eſtate to the heir-male of the marriage. In the year 1727, purpoſing to fulfil that obligation, he diſponed to his eldeſt ſon Robert the lands therein ſpecified, burdened with his debts,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0743600300:136"/>
reſerving to himſelf only an annuity of 2000 merks. The lands of Stewarton, which came under the ſaid obligation, were left out of the diſpoſition 1727. But that they were omitted by the overſight of the writer without intention, was made evident from the following circumſtances. 1<hi>mo,</hi> That the title-deeds of that farm were delivered to the ſon along with the other title-deeds of the eſtate. 2<hi>do,</hi> That he entered into poſſeſſion of the whole. 3<hi>tio,</hi> That a ſubſequent deed by the father, <hi>anno</hi> 1733, relative to the former, proceeds upon this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, <q rend="inline">"That the whole lands belonging to him were convey'd to his ſon by the diſpoſition 1727."</q> Many years thereafter the father having diſcovered that Stewarton was not comprehended in the ſaid diſpoſition, ventured to convey them to his ſecond ſon, who was otherwiſe competently provided. In this caſe it was not pretended that Stewarton was actually conveyed to the ſon, which could not be without a formal diſpoſition. But as there was ſufficient evidence of the agreement to convey theſe lands as part of the eſtate, which the father remained ſtill bound to fulfil, the court judged this a ſufficient foundation to void the gratuitous diſpoſition to the ſecond ſon <note n="*" place="bottom">January 4. 1766, Michael Riddel contra Robert Riddel of Glenriddel.</note>.</p>

                        <p>IT is a ruel in daily practice, that however expreſs the words may be, a court of equity gives no force to a deed beyond the will of the granter. This rule is finely illuſtrated by the following caſe. John Campbell Provoſt of Edinburgh, did, in July 1734, make a ſettlement of the whole effects that ſhould belong to him at the time of his death, to William his eldeſt ſon, with the burden of proviſions to his other children, Matthew, Daniel, and Margaret. Daniel being at ſea in a voyage from the Eaſt Indies, made his will May 1739, in which he <q rend="inline">"gives and bequeaths all his goods, money, and effects, to John Campbell his father; and in caſe of John's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, to his beloved ſiſter Margaret."</q> The teſtator died at ſea in the ſame month of May; and in June following John the father alſo died, without hearing of Daniel's death, or of the will made by him. William brought an action againſt his ſiſter Margaret and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, concluding, That Daniel's effects being veſted in the father, were convey'd to him the purſuer by the father's ſettlement; and that the ſubſtitution in favour of Margaret contained in Daniel's will was thereby altered. It was anſwered, That nothing more was nor could be intended by the Provoſt, than to ſet aſide his heirs <hi>ab inteſtato,</hi> by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0743600300:137"/>
ſettling his proper eſtate upon his eldeſt ſon, and by no means to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſubſtitution in his ſon Daniel's teſtament, of which he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant: That words are not alone, without intention, ſufficient to found a claim; and therefore, that the preſent action ought not to be ſuſtained. <q rend="inline">"The court judged, That the general diſpoſition in 1734, granted by John Campbell to his ſon the purſuer, ſeveral years before Daniel's will had a being, does not evacuate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in the ſaid will <note n="*" place="bottom">June 13. 1740, Campbell contra his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note>."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſame rule is applicable to general clauſes in diſcharges, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, aſſignments, &amp;c. which are limited by equity, when the words evidently appear to be more extenſive than the will. Thus a general ſubmiſſion of all matters debatable is not underſtood to reach land or other heritable rights <note n="†" place="bottom">Hope, (arbiter).

                        <p>If equity will not ſuſtain a deed where the words go inadvertently beyond the intention of the granter, much leſs will it ſuſtain a deed where the words go croſs to intention. Charles Farquharſon writer, being in a ſickly condition, and apprehenſive of death, executed, in the year 1721, a ſettlement of all the effects real and perſonal that he ſhould be poſſeſſed of at his death, in favour of his eldeſt brother Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Farquharſon of Inverey, and his heirs and aſſignees; reſerving a power to alter, and diſpenſing with the delivery. Charles was at that time a bachelor, and died ſo. He recovered however his health, and not only ſurvived his brother Patrick, but alſo his brother's two ſons, who ſucceſſively enjoyed the eſtate of Inverey. Patrick left daughters; but as the inveſtitures of the eſtate were taken to heirs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Charles ſucceeded, died in poſſeſſion of the eſtate, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſame to the next heir-male. Againſt this heir-male a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was brought by the daughters of Patrick, founded upon the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0743600300:138"/>
above-mentioned ſettlement 1721; ſubſuming, That Charles the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker died infeft in the ſaid eſtate of Inverey; and therefore that this eſtate, by force of the ſaid ſettlement, and by the expreſs tenor of it, muſt go to the purſuers, as being the heirs of Patrick Farquharſon. It was anſwered by the heir-male, That Charles's evident purpoſe and intention, in making this deed, was to augment the family-eſtate, by ſettling his own acquiſitions upon Patrick, the head of the family; that this purpoſe was fulfilled by the coalition of both eſtates in the defendant, the preſent head of the family; that the purſuers demand of ſeparating the two eſtates, and of taking from the repreſentative of the family the family-eſtate itſelf, was contradictory to the ſaid purpoſe: and therefore, ſuppoſing the action to be founded on the words of the deed, a court of equity will not ſuſtain an action that tends to give words an effect not only without intention, but even in contradiction to it. <q rend="inline">"The court judged, That the purſuers had no action upon the deed 1721 to oblige the defendant to denude of the eſtate of Inverey <note n="*" place="bottom">Feb. 10. 1756, Heirs of line of Patrick Farquharſon contra heir-male.</note>."</q>

                        <p>A contract of marriage, in which the eſtate was provided to the heirs male of the marriage, whom failing to the huſband's other heirs-male, contained the following clauſe: <q rend="inline">"And ſeeing the earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Perth is tailzied to heirs-male, ſo that if there be daughters of the marriage they will be excluded from the ſucceſſion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid James Lord Drummond and his heirs become bound to pay to the ſaid daughters, at their age of eighteen or marriage, the ſums following, <hi>viz.</hi> to an only daughter 40,000 merks,"</q> &amp;c. The eſtate being forfeited for treaſon committed by the heir-male of the marriage, a claim was entered by the only daughter of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; againſt which it was objected, That the proviſion not being to younger children in general, but to females only, upon the inductive cauſe of the eſtate's being entailed to heirs-male, could only be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take effect failing iſſue-male of the marriage; and that here inadvertently the words are more extenſive than the will.

                     <head>SECT. II. Operation of deeds and covenants beyond what is authoriſed by declared will.</head>
                     <p>TO underſtand a deed or covenant to be no further effectual than as far as will is declared or expreſſed, is a lame and imperfect notion of theſe legal acts. Many deeds and many covenants have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that are not expreſsly provided for; which will thus appear. Every rational man who wills expreſsly to beſtow a right, wills at the ſame time, though not expreſsly, to beſtow every acceſſory or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate right that tends to make effectual the principal right; for he that wills the end, muſt be preſumed to will the means proper to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the end. But whatever a rational man wills, every man is preſumed to will. And hence thefoundation of what in law-language is termed <hi>implied will;</hi> that is, will preſumed without being declared. And it is happy for man to be ſo conſtituted with reſpect to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that binds him; for if in conſcience he were only bound to the articles declared or expreſſed, deeds and covenants would often fall ſhort of their purpoſed end; and, ſtill worſe, would often be the ſource of injuſtice.</p>
                     <p>Before entering into the particulars that belong to this ſection, it muſt be premiſed in general, that every queſtion concerning implied will is appropriated to a court of equity; becauſe a court of common law regards not any act of will but what is expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Upon the principle mentioned, every leaſe of land, long or ſhort, muſt neceſſarily imply a power to remove tenants, where the granter of the leaſe does not himſelf undertake to remove them; for to grant a leaſe intitling the leſſee to enter to poſſeſſion, and yet to with-hold from him the means of obtaining poſſeſſion, is an abſurdity of which no rational man can be guilty.</p>
                     <p>A man who becomes bound to diſpone a debt, will by implied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be bound to convey every execution done upon it. And ſuppoſe he has granted the aſſignment without mentioning the execution, it is however underſtood to be convey'd by implied will.</p>
                     <p>A diſpoſition of an infeftment of annualrent mentioned only the real right, omitting a perſonal obligation that the debtor was under to pay the debt. The court judging that it was the intention of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to put the diſponee in place of the diſponer, without any view to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0743600300:140"/>
benefit the debtor, ſuſtained a perſonal action againſt the debtor at the inſtance of the diſponee, in order to fulfil the ſaid intention <note n="*" place="bottom">Dury, 23d November 1627, Dunbar contra Williamſon.</note>. In a reduction <hi>ex capite inhibitionis</hi> at the inſtance of the aſſignee to a bond upon which an inhibition had been led, the court ſuſtained the aſſignment as a title, though it neither mentioned the inhibition, nor had any general clauſe that could comprehend it. But it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be the intention of the cedent to put the aſſignee in his place, without any view to relieve the debtor; and therefore his will to convey the inhibition along with the debt was implied <note n="†" place="bottom">Harcarſe, (Aſſignation), January 1682. Williamſon contra Threapland.</note>. The only ſcruple here is the conveying an inhibition or a perſonal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without writ. But where the principal ſubject is convey'd in a formal writ, it is not neceſſary that every acceſſory be expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>When a man infefts his wife in land for ſecurity of her jointure payable in corn, it cannot be his intention, without any benefit to himſelf, to free his tenants from the obligation they are under to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their farm-victual to the place of ſale; and therefore his will is implied to convey to his wife this ſervice of the tenants as a natural acceſſory to her right <note n="‡" place="bottom">Fountainhall, 29th July 1680, Counteſs-dowager of Errol contra Earl of Errol.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The nicety in caſes of this kind is, to determine from what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will is to be implied. With reſpect to this point, peculiar atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be given to the purpoſed end, and to what would have been the will of the parties had the thing occurred to them. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior of a feu-right, which was voidable <hi>propter non ſolutum canonem,</hi> diſpoſes of the ſuperiority for a valuable conſideration; and the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, Has the purchaſer a title to inſiſt in a reduction of the feu? It is an acceſſory of the ſuperiority, but not ſo connected but that it may be eaſily disjoined. A reduction of this kind is a ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which every one is not inclined to put in execution; and for that reaſon the conveyance of the privilege to the purchaſer ought to be expreſſed, for it will not readily be implied <note n="‖" place="bottom">Haddington, 14th February 1612, Wedderburn contra Nilbet.</note>. If it would be wrong in a court of equity to imply a conveyance of any right or privilege without any rational preſumption of the granter's will, it would be a ſtill greater wrong to decree any thing contradictory to the declared will; which, however, ſeems to have been done in the following caſe. The ſum of L. 120 was given with an apprentice; and as the maſter was ſick when the articles were drawn, it was provided, that if he died within a year L. 60 ſhould be returned. He having died within
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0743600300:141"/>
three weeks, a bill was brought in chancery to have a greater ſum returned. And though an expreſs proviſion had been made with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that very event, yet it was decreed that a hundred guineas ſhould be returned <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Vernon 460.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Where a diſcharge is granted of the principal debt, acceſſories are underſtood to be comprehended by the implied will of the perſon who grants the diſcharge. For example, an agent employ'd to carry on a proceſs, ſtates an account without any article for his pains. He receives payment of the ſum in the account, and grants a diſcharge in full, without reſervation of any claim for his pains. Under this diſcharge will be comprehended the ſaid claim, either as paſſed from, or as otherwiſe ſatisfied. An implied diſcharge is extended to a ſtill ſtraiter caſe: an extract of a decree implies a paſſing from any claim for coſts of ſuit, however litigious the antagoniſt may have been; for no rational man will extract his decree if he have any view to claim coſts of ſuit.</p>

                     <p>BEfore entering upon particulars, it muſt be premiſed in general, that a court of common law cannot ſupply any imperfection ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a deed or in a covenant.

If there be no right created, a court of equity has not power, more than a court of common law, to ſupply any defect. For this in effect would be to create a right; or, in other words, to make a will for a man who has made none for himſelf: a court of equity cannot make a deed for an individual, more than it can make a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for the whole people.</p>

                        <p>A MORTGAGE or contract of wadſet contains the uſual clauſe of conſigning the money in caſe of refuſal. The place of conſignation is fixed; but by overſight a conſignator is not named. The court of ſeſſion will ſupply this defect by naming a conſignator. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſer is intitled to redeem his land; and it would be inconſiſtent with juſtice that he ſhould be forfeited of his right by a mere overſight: a court of equity is authoriſed to ſupply the defect, upon the foreſaid principle That where there is a right it ought to be made effectual.</p>
                        <p>A wadſet was granted to be held of the ſuperior, and infeftment paſſed accordingly; but the reverſer omitted to provide, that, upon redemption, the wadſetter ſhould ſurrender the ſubject in the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior's hands for new infeftment to the reverſer; which was neceſſary to reſtore him to his former ſituation.

                        <p>A MAN believing his wife to be pregnant, left a legacy to a friend in the following terms; <q rend="inline">"That if a male child was brought forth, the ſum ſhould be 4000 merks; if a female, 5000 merks."</q> The wife produced no child; and the queſtion is, Whether any ſum was due to the legatee, and what that ſum ſhould be? In this caſe it is clear, that the teſtator intended a legacy to his friend in all events; for if the friend was to have a legacy even in caſe of a child, much more if there ſhould be no child. The queſtion then is, Whether omiſſion by overſight of the event that really happened, ought to diſappoint the teſtator's will, who in all events intended a legacy? If this were to be the effect, law might juſtly be accuſed of harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſeverity. It is one of the uſeful branches of judicial power, to give the utmoſt effect to the ſettlements of thoſe who are no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in this world to act for themſelves: a man dies in peace, when he truſts that his deeds will be made effectual, fairly and candidly, according to his intention.

Objected by his Majeſty's Advocate, That ſhe is intitled to forty chalders only, there being ſons of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, who, but for the forfeiture, would ſucceed to the eſtate. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the words of the contract ſtrictly according to the principles of common law, the claim muſt be reſtricted to forty chalders; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot be ſaid literally, that there are no children of the marriage who can ſucceed to and enjoy the eſtate. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture is plainly a <hi>caſus incogitatus,</hi> about which the parties interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no will; and equity dictates that the lady ought not to ſuffer by this overſight, but that the ſame ought to be ſupplied by the court, provided it can be made evident what would have been the will of the parties had the event been foreſeen.

                        <p>I GIVE an example that will be a key to the whole. An old ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor, having no proſpect of iſſue becauſe he had no intention to marry, makes a ſettlement of his eſtate by diſponing the ſame to a near relation, and to a certain ſeries of heirs, reſerving his own life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, with a power to alter. He takes a different thought, marries, and dies ſuddenly, without altering his ſettlement, leaving his wife pregnant. A male child is born, and claims the eſtate. The ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be ſupported at common law, becauſe the words are clear for the diſponee. And as the granter's will is alſo for him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, it is not obvious upon what principle a court of equity can interpoſe to overturn this ſettlement, without making a new will for a man who made none for himſelf. Yet, on the other hand, it would be a concluſion in law extremely harſh, to exheredate this favourite child, upon no better ground than a mere overſight of his father, and to inforce a ſettlement in an event which the maker would avoid with horror were he alive. The following argument promiſes to extricate us from this dilemma. The will of the maker in favour of the diſponee, is not abſolute to take place in all events; but only upon ſuppoſition of what he took for granted, that he was to have no iſſue. Therefore in the event that has happened the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponee cannot ſay that the will of the maker is for him: conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſettlement gives him no right. For the ſake of illuſtration, it may be added, that there is no difference in ſubſtance between a limited will, ſuch as that under conſideration, and a will that is conditional; for the binding act of the will is equally qualified by both: the difference is with reſpect to evidence only; the ſame act of will that is ſaid to be limited when the limitation is left to be gathered from circumſtances, being termed <hi>conditional</hi> when the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation is expreſſed and not left upon circumſtances. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a limited will cannot create a more extenſive right than a will that is conditional. This doctrine is by no means new, though put in a new dreſs; for what elſe is an implied condition ſo much talked of in the Roman law, but a limitation of will inferred from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? Hence it follows, that the ſettlement under conſideration is void in equity, for the ſame reaſon that it would be void even at common law, if the condition <q rend="inline">"failing heirs of the granter's body"</q> had been expreſſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0743600300:146"/>
Another reaſon in equity concurs for voiding this ſettlement. The omiſſion of the condition, <q rend="inline">"failing heirs of the granter's body,"</q> was plainly an overſight; and the diſponee ought not in conſcience to take advantage of that overſight <hi>ad lucrum captandum.</hi> This follows from the rule above laid down, That <hi>in damno evitando</hi> one may take advantage of an error, but not <hi>in lucro captando.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But where the child died in a few months, the ſettlement was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; becauſe the child was not hurt by the ſettlement <note n="*" place="bottom">Next of kin of Iſabel Watt contra Iſabel Jervie, July 30. 1760.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The following caſe is preciſely of the ſame nature. A man having lent a ſum, and taken a bond for the ſame, payable to himſelf, and to his children <hi>nominatim</hi> in fee, equally and proportionally, with this proviſion, <q rend="inline">"That in caſe of the deceaſe of any of the ſaid children, the ſhare of the predeceaſing child ſhall be equally divided among the ſurvivors;"</q> and one of the children, a ſon, having predeceaſed his father, leaving iſſue, the queſtion occurred, Whether his ſhare of the bond did not, in terms of the ſaid clauſe, accrue to the ſurvivors, excluſive of his iſſue. The court was of opinion, that the granter did not intend to exclude the iſſue of any of his predeceaſing children; that he would have provided for ſaid iſſue had the event been foreſeen; and upon that medium they preferred the iſſue of the predeceaſing ſon <note n="†" place="bottom">November 21. 1738, Magiſtrates of Montroſe contra Robertſon.</note>. Papinian, the greateſt of the Roman lawyers, gives the ſame opinion in a ſimilar caſe: <q rend="inline">"Cum avus filium, ac nepotem ex altero filio, heredes inſtituiſſet, a nepote petiit, ut <hi>ſi intra annum trigeſimum moriretur, hereditatem patruo ſuo reſtitueret:</hi> nepos, liberis relictis, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra aetatem ſupraſcriptam vita deceſſit: fideicommiſſi conditionem, conjectura pietatis, reſpondi defeciſſe, quod minus ſcriptum, quam dictum fuerat, inveniretur <note n="‡" place="bottom">l. 102. De cond. demonſt. et cauſis.</note>."</q> This opinion is founded on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial equity; and yet the reaſon given appears to be ſlight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious. Our author ſuppoſes, that the teſtator, declaring his will, had provided for the iſſue of his grandchild, but that this proviſion had been caſually omitted by the writer; which is cutting the Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian knot inſtead of untying it. For what if this event was really o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooked? Suppoſing this to be the fact, we are left without a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The ſolid foundation of the opinion is, that a deed ought not to be made effectual in equity, when by overſight it extends to an event that was not meant to be comprehended. So much eaſier it is to judge or perceive what is right, than to give a ſolid reaſon for our judgment.</p>

No perſon can heſitate about the application of this rule to unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen events, which are brought about, not caſually, but by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in whoſe favour the deed is granted. A man having no male iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, ſettled his whole eſtate, real and perſonal, upon his eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with the following proviſo, That ſhe ſhould pay 10,000 merks to her two ſiſters. The diſpoſition, being granted on deathbed, was challenged by theſe ſiſters, and voided as to the land-eſtate. The queſtion enſued, Whether they who by their challenge got more than the 10,000 merks, had a claim for that ſum over and above. They urged their father's expreſs will. But it being anſwered, That having overturned their father's will, they could not claim upon it; their claim was diſmiſſed <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, February 1. 1671, Pringle contra Pringle.</note>. Here was not only an unexpected event, which would have been guarded againſt had it been foreſeen; but further, the event, repugnant to the will of the granter, was the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of perſons honoured by the deed, whoſe ingratitude juſtly bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them from taking any benefit by it. The following is a ſimilar caſe. John Earl of Dundonald, by a bond of entail, made a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his land-eſtate on his heirs-male: at the ſame time he ſettled his moveables by will; and alſo executed bonds of proviſion in favour of his daughters. Theſe ſeveral deeds executed <hi>unico contextu,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with the granter undelivered, made a complete ſettlement of his eſtate real and perſonal; and proved it to be his intention, that his daughters ſhould take nothing from him but their proviſions. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Earl's death, it being diſcovered that ſome of the lands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his entail had not been veſted in him, but ſtill remained <hi>in hereditate jacente</hi> of a remote predeceſſor, the daughters as heirs of line laid claim to theſe lands. It was objected, That they could not alſo claim their proviſions, which were given them as being totally exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the ſucceſſion, and as not otherwiſe provided; becauſe a deed calculated for one event cannot be effectual in another. <q rend="inline">"The court judged, That the ladies could not claim their bonds of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and likewiſe the lands as heirs of line; but that they might claim one or other at their option <note n="†" place="bottom">February 20. 1729, Counteſs of Strathmore and Lady Katharine Cochran contra Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Clydeſdale and Earl of Dundonald.</note>."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the doctrine thus illuſtrated, it may be eſtabliſhed as another rule in equity, That a perſon honoured in a deed, who counteracts the will of the granter declared in the deed, can take no benefit by it.</p>
                        <p>Reflecting upon the foregoing doctrine, we perceive a remarkable difference between a donation completed by a transference of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0743600300:148"/>
and a donation incompleted, which requires an action againſt the donor or his heirs. In the former caſe, no unforeſeen event will be ſufficient to reſtore the property to the donor: there is no principle of law nor of equity upon which ſuch an action can be founded. In the latter caſe, an unforeſeen event makes it the duty of a court of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to deny action, and conſequently to render the donation ineffectual, unleſs the granter or his heir be ſo ſcrupulouſly moral, as of their own accord to fulfil it.</p>
                        <p>The ſame rule holds where the granter is alive, ſuppoſing only he have put it out of his power to alter; for ſo long as the deed is under his own power, he has no occaſion for an equitable relief. When an obligation, relative to a certain event expected, is ſought to be made effectual in an unexpected event, a court of equity denies its authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This rule with reſpect to the living ſhall be illuſtrated by ſeveral examples. A diſpoſition of land granted by a man to his wife was ratified by the heir, who in the ſame deed bound himſelf to purge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances affecting the land, <q rend="inline">"upon the view and in contemplation of ſucceeding to the reſt of the eſtate,"</q> as expreſſed in the deed of ratification. The heir being charged by the widow to purge incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, the following reaſon of ſuſpenſion was ſuſtained, That the heir was excluded by an expired appriſing of the whole eſtate, of which he was ignorant when he granted the ratification; and that this fact muſt liberate him from his obligation, to grant which he could have no other motive but the proſpect of enjoying the eſtate <note n="*" place="bottom">Fountainhall, December 19. 1684, Home. March 1685, Ducheſs of Lauderdale contra Earl of Lauderdale.</note>. Equity here juſtly relieved from an obligation that was calculated for an event oppoſite to that which happened.</p>
                        <p>Donations <hi>mortis cauſa</hi> are regulated by the ſame principle. A man having a near proſpect of death, executes a deed in favour of a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or friend, without reſerving a power of alteration. Contrary to expectation he recovers, and lives ſeveral years. The deed is effectual at common law; but the granter is relieved in equity, becauſe the deed was made with a view to an event that did not happen.</p>

A deed or covenant calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with perfect foreſight to bring about the deſired end, is binding in juſtice; for in that caſe there can be no pretext for with-holding performance: but if a deed or covenant, by ignorance or miſtake, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer not the end for which it was made, a court of equity will not make it effectual. For conſidering it to be a mean, the objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it is invincible, That no mean ought to be regarded but as far as it tends to accompliſh the end. To think otherwiſe is to ſuppoſe the performance of the deed or covenant to be the ultimate end, and not the mean to the ultimate end.</p>

                        <p>THE moſt noted caſe that comes under this article, is where goods, by ſome latent inſufficiency, anſwer not the end for which they are bought. Though the vender be <hi>in bona fide,</hi> yet the purchaſer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in equity from performance. Thus in purchaſing wine for drinking, though I put my mark upon a particular hogſhead as the product of a certain vineyard, to be delivered to me at a price named; yet if upon trial it prove ſour, and be unfit for drinking, I am not bound to receive it however preciſe the bargain was.</p>
                        <p>A large cargo of ſtrong ale was purchaſed from a brewer in Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow, in order to be exported to New York. In a ſuit for the price the following defence was ſuſtained, That it was not properly prepared for the heat of that climate; and that accordingly it had burſted the bottles, and was loſt. It was not ſuppoſed that the brewer had been guilty of any wilful wrong; but this defence was ſuſtained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the following rule of equity, That a man who purchaſes goods for a certain purpoſe, is not bound to receive them unleſs they anſwer that purpoſe; which holds <hi>a fortiori</hi> where the vender is himſelf the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturer. And where the inſufficiency cannot be known to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer but upon trial, the rule holds even tho' the goods be delivered to him. It was alſo in view, that if the brewer be not anſwerable for the ſufficiency of ale ſold by him for the American market, that branch of commerce cannot be carried on <note n="*" place="bottom">December 13. 1765, Baird contra Pagan.</note>.</p>
                        <p>An inſolvent debtor makes a truſt-right in favour of his creditors; and among his other ſubjects, diſpones to the truſtees his intereſt in a company-ſtock. A ſtranger, who by furniſhing goods to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany became creditor to the bankrupt as one of the company, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0743600300:150"/>
likewiſe was clearly preferable upon the company-ſtock before the bankrupt's private creditors, being ignorant of his preference, accedes to the truſt-right, and conſents to an equal diſtribution of the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt's effects. Being afterward informed of his preference, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, while matters are yet entire. <hi>Quaer.</hi> Is he bound by his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? He undoubtedly draws by it all the benefit he had a proſpect of; and conſidering the agreement ſingly, without relation to the end, he is bound; and ſo ſays common law. But equity conſiders the end and purpoſe of the agreement; which is, that the ſtranger ſhall draw ſuch proportion of the bankrupt's effects as he is intitled to by law. The means concerted, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhall draw an equal proportion, contribute not to this end, but to one very different, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhall draw leſs than what is juſt, and the other creditors more. Equity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves from an engagement where ſuch is the unexpected reſult; there being no authority from the intendment of parties to make it obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory where it anſwers not the purpoſed end.</p>
                        <p>Having laid open the foundation in equity for giving relief againſt a covenant where performance will not anſwer the end propoſed by it, I proceed to examine whether there be any relief in equity after the covenant is fulfilled. I buy, for example, a lame horſe unfit for work; but this defect is not diſcovered till the horſe is delivered, and the price paid. If the vender hath engaged to warrant the horſe as ſufficient, he is liable at common law to fulfil his covenant. But ſuppoſing this paction not to have been interpoſed, it appears to me not at all clear, that there is any foundation in equity for voiding the ſale thus completed. The horſe is now my property by the purchaſe, and the price is equally the vender's property. If he knew that the horſe was lame, he is guilty of a wrong that ought to ſubject him to the higheſt damages: but ſuppoſing him <hi>in bona ſide,</hi> I ſee no ground for any claim againſt him. The ground of equity that relieves me from paying for a horſe that can be of no uſe, turns now againſt me in favour of the vender; for why ſhould he be bound to take my horſe that can be of no uſe to him, more than I was formerly bound to take his horſe that could be of no uſe to me? The Roman law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed gave an <hi>actio redhibitoria</hi> in this caſe, obliging the vender to take back the horſe and to return the price. But I diſcover a reaſon for this practice in a principle of the Roman law, that will not ſquare with our practice, nor with that of any other commercial nation. The principle is That ſuch contracts as are intended to be equal, ought to anſwer the intention: and therefore in ſuch contracts the Roman Pretor never permitted any conſiderable inequality. Hence the <hi>actio quanti minoris,</hi>
                           <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0743600300:151"/>
which was given to a purchaſer who by ignorance or error paid more for a ſubject than it is intrinſically worth: and it follows upon the ſame plan of equity, that if a ſubject be purchaſed which is good for nothing, the <hi>actio quanti minoris</hi> muſt reſolve into an <hi>actio redhibitoria.</hi> But equity may be carried ſo far as to be prejudicial to commerce by encouraging law-ſuits; and for that reaſon we admit not the <hi>actio quanti minoris:</hi> the principle of utility rejects it, experience having demonſtrated that it is a great interruption to the free courſe of commerce. The ſame principle of utility rejects the <hi>actio redhibitoria</hi> as far as founded on inequality; and after a ſale is completed by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, I have endeavoured to ſhow, that if inequality be laid aſide, there is no foundation for the <hi>actio redhibitoria.</hi> In Scotland, however, though the <hi>actio quanti minoris</hi> is rejected, the <hi>actio redhibitoria</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted where a latent inſufficiency unqualifies the ſubject for the end with a view to which it was purchaſed. This practice, as appears to me, is out of all rule. If we adhere ſtrictly to equity without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utility, we ought to ſuſtain the <hi>actio quanti minoris</hi> as well as the <hi>actio redhibitoria.</hi> But if we give way to utility, the great law in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial dealings, we ought to ſuſtain neither. To indulge diſputes about the true value of every commercial ſubject would deſtroy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: and for that reaſon, equity, which has no other object but the intereſt of a ſingle perſon, muſt yield to utility, which regards the whole ſociety.</p>
                        <p>The doctrine above delivered will be finely illuſtrated by applying it to erroneous payment, or <hi>ſolutio indebiti,</hi> which makes a great figure in the Roman law. Of erroneous payment there are two kinds clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhable from each other: one where a debt is erroneouſly ſuppoſed to exiſt that is extinguiſhed, or perhaps never exiſted; and one where there is really a debt, but the perſon who pays is not debtor.</p>
                        <p>To explain what equity dictates with reſpect to erroneous payment of the firſt kind, ſeveral caſes ſhall be ſtated that give light to each other. I begin with the caſe of a bonded debt, which, after being extinguiſhed by payment, is purchaſed <hi>bona fide</hi> for a valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and the debtor's heir, ignorant of the extinction, grants a bond of corroboration to the aſſignee. After the granting this bond of corroboration, but before payment, the extinction of the bond corroborated comes to be diſcovered; and, to make the queſtion of importance, we ſhall ſuppoſe that the cedent or aſſignor becomes bankrupt after the date of the bond of corroboration. Both parties here are <hi>certantes de dammo evitando:</hi> if the bond of corroboration be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0743600300:152"/>
made effectual, the debtor is forc'd to pay a debt that is not due: if on the other hand he be relieved from it, the aſſignee loſes the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſideration he paid to the cedent. What does equity rule in this caſe? Upon the principle above laid down, it relieves againſt the bond of corroboration. A corroborative ſecurity is not intended to create a new debt, but only to ſecure the payment of one already due; and therefore no claim can in equity be founded on the bond of corroboration independent of the debt corroborated: if the debt corroborated be imaginary, the bond of corroboration muſt go for nothing: it poſſibly may be worded in abſolute terms, <hi>viz.</hi> to pay the ſum ſtipulated at a preciſe day; but words againſt or beyond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention cannot operate in equity. For this reaſon I cannot agree to the following opinion: <q rend="inline">"Si quis indebitam pecuniam, per errorem, juſſu mulieris, ſponſo ejus promiſiſſet, et nuptiae ſecutae fuiſſent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione doli mali uti non poteſt. Maritus enim ſuum negotium gerit; et nihil dolo facit, nec decipiendus eſt: quod fit, ſi cogatur indotatam uxorem habere. Itaque adverſus mulierem condictio ei competit, ut aut repetat ab ea quod marito dedit, aut ut liberetur, ſi nondum ſolverit <note n="*" place="bottom">1. 9. § 1. De condic. cauſa data.</note>."</q> This reaſoning is not ſatisfactory. The huſband indeed is not <hi>in mala fide</hi> to demand what is promiſed him; but neither is his party <hi>in mala fide</hi> for refuſing to pay a debt a ſecond time: and equity will not compel a man to perform a promiſe, when performance cannot anſwer the end for which the promiſe was made.</p>
                        <p>Let us next ſuppoſe, that the ſum contained in the bond of corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration is actually paid. Whether in this caſe is the aſſignee bound to reſtore the money, when it is diſcovered that the debt corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was imaginary, and that nothing was due? Neither equity nor common law gives relief in this caſe. The property of the money paid is transferred to the aſſignee; and it is an inviolable rule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as well as of common law. That no man can be forfeited of his property who is guilty of no fault. Neither is the money in his hand <hi>ſine cauſa,</hi> for the ſum he gave to the cedent is a juſt cauſe. Comparing this caſe with the former, the matter turns out as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth in point of equity, <hi>quod potior eſt conditio poſſidentis.</hi> If the ſum be promiſed only, equity relieves from payment: but if it be paid, there is no foundation in equity for depriving the aſſignee of his property. Thus a creditor, after obtaining a partial payment, aſſigned the whole ſum for ſecurity of a debt due by him to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee. The aſſignee, having got payment of the whole from the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0743600300:153"/>
debtor, ignorant of the former payment, was, upon diſcovery of the fact, ſued for reſtitution <hi>condictione indebiti.</hi> He put his defence upon <hi>l.</hi> 44. <hi>condic. indeb.</hi> inſiſting, that he received no more than what was due to him by the cedent, that <hi>ſuum recepit,</hi> and that he was not bound to reſtore what he got in payment of a juſt debt. The defence accordingly was ſuſtained <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair. Feb. 23. 1681, Earl Mar contra Earl Callander.</note>. The following deciſion is of the ſame nature. An heir having ignorantly paid a debt to an aſſignee for a valuable conſideration, and ſeveral years thereafter having diſcovered that his anceſtor had paid the debt to the cedent, he inſiſted in a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio indebiti</hi> againſt the aſſignee, and the defendant was aſſoilzied <note n="†" place="bottom">July <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I mention this caſe the rather, becauſe, along with the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence above mentioned, That a man cannot be deprived of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty who is not guilty of any fault, a ſeparate defence in equity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from the following circumſtance, that after the erroneous pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the cedent became bankrupt. Laying hold of this circumſtance, the aſſignee argued, That, truſting to the payment, he had neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſecure himſelf by an action of warrandice, which would have been effectual to him while the cedent continued ſolvent; and that the cedent's bankruptcy ought not to affect him, but the purſuer, by whoſe miſtake the loſs was occaſioned. What is ſaid above will clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhow, that the following deciſion is erroneous. An executor-credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor having confirmed a debt as due to the deceaſed, and having upon that title obtained payment from the debtor's heir, was decerned to reſtore the money, it being afterward diſcovered, that the debt had been paid to the original creditor <note n="‡" place="bottom">Stair, Gosford, January 10. 1673, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay contra Robertſon.</note>.</p>
                        <p>We proceed to the caſe where there is really a debt, but where the perſon who pays is not debtor. This caſe ſeems to have divided the writers on the Roman law.

Yet this ſame Paulus in another treatiſe refuſes action <note n="††" place="bottom">l. 44. codem.</note>. The ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this queſtion ſeems not to be difficult. Suppoſing the debt to be extinguiſhed by this erroneous payment, a <hi>condictio</hi> cannot be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt the creditor; for it would be groſsly unjuſt to deprive him both of his debt, and of the ſum he received in payment of it. But the following reaſons evince that the debt is not extinguiſhed by the erroneous payment. 1ſt, If the creditor, upon diſcovering the miſtake, ſhould think proper to reſtore the money, there is nothing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0743600300:154"/>
in law to bar ſuch tranſaction: and if ſo, it is clear that the debt muſt remain entire. 2d, The true debtor, notwithſtanding the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous payment, is intitled to force a diſcharge from the creditor, upon offering him payment; which he could not do if he did not ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue debtor. Whence it neceſſarily follows, that the creditor holds this money <hi>ſine juſta cauſa;</hi> and conſequently, that a <hi>condictio indebiti</hi> againſt him is well founded.</p>

                        <p>CONTRACTS ſhall furniſh the firſt examples. In a bargain of ſale, the price is referred to a third party: the referee dies ſuddenly without determining the price; and there is no performance on either ſide. There being no remedy here at common law, becauſe the price is not aſcertained, can a court of equity ſupply the defect in order to make the bargain effectual? This queſtion depends upon what the parties intended by the reference. If they intended not to be bound but by the opinion of the referee, it is in effect a conditional bargain, never purified; according to which conſtruction there is no place for equity, becauſe there is no defect in the bargain, nor any right created to either party. But if the parties intended that the ſale ſhould in all events be effectual, which will be preſumed as the more rational conſtruction, a right upon that ſuppoſition is created to each party, intitling the one to the ſubject and the other to the value; and it is the duty of a court of equity to make theſe rights ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, by ſupplying the defect, and naming a price <hi>ſecundum arbitrium boni viri.</hi>

                        <p>A man having purchaſed land, gave a backbond obliging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to rediſpone, upon the vender's repaying the price within a time limited. The vender having died before the day named, the land was found legally redeemed, upon the heir's offering the price before elapſing of the term <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, January 9. 1662, Earl of Murray contra Grant.</note>.

Suppoſing the backbond to be merely a gratuitous deed, and conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the judgement is right. But if the backbond be held to be the counter part of the bond, each of them a branch of a mutual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſeems to be the more natural conſtruction, it may be doubted whether the brother was not in all events intitled to a miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                        <p>The next examples ſhall be from deeds. The miniſter of Weem, in a deed of mortification, ſettled his funds upon five truſtees and their ſucceſſors, for the uſe of the ſchoolmaſters of that pariſh, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the major part of the truſtees to be a quorum. Two only of the truſtees having accepted and intermeddled with the funds, a proceſs was brought againſt them by the repreſentatives of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, claiming the funds, which were ſtill in the hands of the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees unapplied, upon the following ground, That the deed of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is ineffectual, not having been completed by acceptance of a quorum of the truſtees. It was anſwered, That by the deed of mortification aſſigning the funds to truſtees for the uſe of the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters of Weem, a right was veſted in theſe ſchoolmaſters, which the truſtees, by not-acceptance, could not defeat; and that ſuppoſe the whole of them had refuſed to accept, an action would lie againſt them at the inſtance of the ſchoolmaſter, to denude in favour of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truſtees to be named by the court. The deed of mortification was ſuſtained; the court being of opinion, that it would have been effectual though the whole truſtees had declined acceptance <note n="†" place="bottom">December 1752, Campbell contra Campbell of Monzie and Campbell of Achallader.</note>. I il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this by an oppoſite caſe, where no right was created by the deed. Lady Preſtonfield executed a ſettlement of conſiderable funds to Sir John Cunninghame, her eldeſt ſon, and Anne Cunninghame, her eldeſt daughter, as truſtees for the ends and purpoſes following. 1<hi>mo,</hi> The yearly intereſt to be applied for the education and ſupport of ſuch of the granter's deſcendants as ſhould happen to be in want,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0743600300:156"/>
or ſtand in need thereof, and that at the diſcretion of the truſtees. 2<hi>do,</hi> Failing deſcendants, the capital is to return to her neareſt heirs. The truſtees declining to accept this whimſical ſettlement, a proceſs for voiding it was brought by the heir at law, in which were called all the exiſting deſcendants of the maker. It was urged, That by this ſettlement there is no right veſted in the defendants, nor in any other deſcendant of the maker; becauſe all is left upon the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truſtees, who cannot be compelled by law, ſuppoſing their acceptance, to give a penny to any particular deſcendant; that the ſettlement is void by the non-acceptance of the truſtees; that the funds thereby belong to the purſuer, heir at law; and that there is no equity to deprive the purſuer of his property for the behoof of the defendants, who have in no event a legal claim. The deed was declared void by non-acceptance of the truſtees <note n="*" place="bottom">January 22. 1758, Sir Alexander Dick contra Mrs Ferguſon and her children.</note>. Here the court juſtly refuſed to ſupply other means for making the will of the deceaſed effectual; becauſe, by the whole tenor of the ſettlement, it appeared to be her will, that all ſhould be left upon the diſcretion of the truſtees named, and no purpoſe was expreſſed to give her deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants any right independent of theſe truſtees.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Campbell being bound in his contract of marriage to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſum of 40,000 merks, and the conqueſt during the marriage, to himſelf and ſpouſe in conjunct fee and liferent, and to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be procreated of the marriage in fee, did, by a deathbed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſettle all upon his eldeſt ſon, burdened with the ſum of 30,000 merks to his younger children, to take place in caſe their mother ſhould give up her claim to the liferent of the conqueſt, and reſtrict herſelf to a leſs jointure; otherwiſe theſe proviſions to be void; in which event it was left upon the Duke of Argyle and Earl of Ilay to name ſuch proviſions to the children as they ſhould ſee convenient. The referees having declined to accept the truſt repoſed in them, the queſtion occurred between the heir and younger children, Whether the powers of the referees were devolved upon the court of ſeſſion to determine proviſions to the younger children <hi>ſecundum arbitrium boni viri;</hi> or whether the younger children were to be left to the claim they had by the contract of marriage? The court was of opinion, that the Duke of Argyle and Earl of Ilay having declined to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the powers veſted in them by Colonel Campbell, their powers are not devolved upon this court <hi>tanquam boni viri</hi> 
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">December 22. 1739, Campbell contra Campbells.</note>. This judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0743600300:157"/>
cannot be juſtified upon any ground other than that of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the determination of the Duke of Argyle and Earl of Ilay as a condition, without which the children were not to have a proviſion. The ſettlement appears to me in a different light. The Colonel's will to provide his younger children in all events, is clearly expreſſed. As he was doubtful what the ſum ſhould be in caſe their mother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon her jointure, he left it upon the referees to name the ſum, not doubting their acceptance. This reference I conſider to be the means choſen by the Colonel for accompliſhing his purpoſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding his children; but not ſo as to exclude all other means. His younger children were intitled to a proviſion by his will; and failing the means choſen by him for aſcertaining the extent, juſtice required that other means ſhould be ſubſtituted, in order to make their claim effectual. This caſe reſembles very much that above mentioned concerning a ſum ſettled upon truſtees for the uſe of the ſchoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Weem. The ſettlement upon truſtees was a means only for making the mortification effectual; and the failure of the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees could have no other effect but to make way for ſupplying other means.</p>

                        <p>JAMES THOMSON, in his marriage-contract, provides his eſtate and conqueſt to the heirs of the marriage. His eldeſt ſon, being idle and profligate, contracted debts, and became bankrupt; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the old man to make a ſettlement upon the ſaid ſon in life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and upon his heirs in fee. The bankrupt's creditors, after the father's death, brought a reduction of this ſettlement, as in defraud of the marriage-contract. The court aſſoilzied the defenders upon the following ground, That though the bankrupt was intitled to the fee at common law, yet in a contract intended for the benefit of thoſe who ſhould ſpring from the marriage, it could not be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the contractors to ſecure the eſtate to creditors in caſe of the heir's bankruptcy.

                        <p>A GRATUITOUS bond by a minor being voided at the inſtance of his heir, becauſe a minor cannot bind himſelf without a valuable conſideration, the obligee inſiſted for an equivalent out of the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables left by the minor, upon the following ground, That the bond implied a legacy, which the minor could have granted by making a teſtament. It was yielded, that if the heir's challenge had been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, the minor would probably have given a legacy inſtead of the bond; but that as the minor had not exerted any act of will with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a legacy, the court could not make a teſtament for a man who had not made one for himſelf. The court accordingly refuſed to tranſubſtantiate the bond into a legacy <note n="*" place="bottom">Fountainhall, December 15. 1698, Straiton contra Wight.</note>. In this caſe, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me, the <hi>ratio decidendi</hi> is taken from common law, not from equity. One thing ſeems clear, that the minor intended in all events to beſtow the ſum named upon his friend the obligee; for if he was willing to bind himſelf perſonally to pay the ſum, he could not have the leaſt heſitation to bind his repreſentatives by bequeathing it as a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy. And if this be admitted, the conſequence is fair, that the friend thereby acquired a right, which it was the duty of the court of ſeſſion to make effectual, by ſuſtaining a claim againſt the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the ſame manner as if the ſum had been a legacy. Conſidering this matter in a different light, I can diſcover no good reaſon why a minor, who can diſpoſe of his moveables by teſtament, may not do the ſame in the form of a bond, dropping only the clauſes that are more beneficial to the obligee than a legacy would be. So far a bond may be juſtly conſidered as a virtual legacy.</p>
                        <p>A gratuitous diſpoſition of an heritable ſubject being voided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe granted on deathbed, the diſponee claimed the value from the executor, preſuming that the deceaſed would have given an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent had he foreſeen the event. Decreed, That the diſpoſition could not affect the executry, either as a debt, or as a legacy <note n="†" place="bottom">Dirleton, November 12, Stair, November 26. 1674, Paton contra Stirling. Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, November 22. 1698, Cummin contra Cummin.</note>. This judgement muſt be approved; for it is far from being clear that the value of the heritable ſubject was intended in all events to be made effectual to the diſponee. It may be a man's will to alien from his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0743600300:159"/>
heir an heritable ſubject, though he would not burden his executors with the value, ſuppoſing them to be a number of younger children. This argument goes on the ſuppoſition that the diſponer knew the ſubject to be heritable. But what if by miſtake he took it to be moveable? This is more doubtful. And yet even upon that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition it would be bold to give an equivalent; becauſe a man may have motives for beſtowing upon his friend a certain ſubject, who would not be diſpoſed to burden either his heir or executor with an equivalent ſum.</p>
                        <p>The reaſoning here coincides with that in the Roman law about a <hi>legatum rei alienae.</hi> If the teſtator leave a ſpecial legacy of a ſubject, believed to be his own, which after his death is diſcovered to belong to a ſtranger; the heir is not bound to give an equivalent, becauſe here <hi>deficit voluntas teſtatoris.</hi> This in other words is ſaying as above, That it is not clear the teſtator intended in all events either the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or its value: the ſubject legated may be conſiderable; and poſſibly the teſtator would not have left it in legacy had he not conſidered it as making part of his ſtock. But if the teſtator knew that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject belonged to another, it muſt have been his will and intention, if he did not mean to play the fool, that it ſhould be purchaſed by his heir for the legatee; and upon that ſuppoſition a right is created in the legatee, which ought to be made effectual by a court of equity.</p>
                        <p>A man makes a ſettlement of his eſtate on his eldeſt ſon in tail, with a power, by deed or will under ſeal, to charge the lands with any ſum not exceeding L. 500. He prepares a deed, and gets it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed, by which he appoints the L. 500 to his younger children, but dies before it is ſigned or ſealed; yet this in equity ſhall amount to a good execution of his power, the ſubſtance being performed <note n="*" place="bottom">Abridg. caſes in equity, ch. 44. ſect. B. § 14.</note>. Here there could be no doubt about the man's will creating a right to his younger children. The power he reſerved of charging the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate by deed or will under ſeal, was not intended to make their right conditional, but to give them the higheſt ſecurity that is known in law. This ſecurity was indeed diſappointed by the man's ſudden death; but he had ſufficiently declared his purpoſe of giving them L. 500, which afforded them a good claim in equity for that ſum.</p>
                        <p>Provoſt Aberdein inclining to have a country-ſeat near the town of Aberdeen, and finding that Farquharſon of Invercauld was willing to ſell the lands of Crabſton, within three miles of that town, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties exchanged miſſive letters, agreeing, That the land ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to the Provoſt in liferent, and to any of his children he ſhould
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0743600300:160"/>
pleaſe in fee; and that the price ſhould be L. 3900 Sterling. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this agreement, the title deeds of the eſtate were delivered to a writer, who, by the Provoſt's orders, made out a ſcroll of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to be granted by Invercauld to the Provoſt in liferent, and to Alexander, the only ſon of his ſecond marriage, in fee: which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by the Provoſt, a diſpoſition was extended upon the 12th June 1756, and diſpatched to Invercauld at his country-ſeat, incloſed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter ſubſcribed by the Provoſt: <q rend="inline">"This will come along with the amended diſpoſition, and upon its being delivered to me duly ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I am to put the bond for the price in the hand of your doer."</q> Invercauld not being at home, the packet was delivered to his lady. As ſoon as he returned home, which was on the 21ſt of the ſaid month of June, he ſubſcribed the diſpoſition, and ſent it with a truſty hand to Aberdeen, to be delivered to the Provoſt. But the Provoſt, being taken ſuddenly ill, died on the 24th of June, a few hours before the expreſs arrived at Aberdeen; by which means it happened, that the diſpoſition was not delivered to him, nor the bond for the price grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. This unforeſeen accident gave riſe to a queſtion between Robert, the Provoſt's eldeſt ſon and heir, and the ſaid Alexander ſon of the ſecond marriage. For Robert it was pleaded, That to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the ſaid diſpoſition, and to make it an effectual ſettlement of the lands of Crabſton, the Provoſt's acceptance was requiſite; that this act not having been interpoſed, the diſpoſition remained an undeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered evident, not leſs ineffectual than if it had wanted the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the granter; and that, laying aſide this incompleted deed, the Provoſt's claim to the lands of Crabſton, reſting upon the mutual miſſives, muſt deſcend to his heir at law, ſeeing none of his children is named in theſe miſſives. It was anſwered for Alexander the ſon of the ſecond marriage, That his father's will being clearly for him, the court of ſeſſion as a court of equity ought to make that will effectual, however defective the powers of the court may be as a court of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law.

                        <p>A COURT of common law makes no other inquiry but what acts of will were really exerted, which are made effectual without the leaſt regard to conſequences. A court of equity, more at liberty to follow the dictates of refined juſtice, conſiders every deed and covenant in its
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0743600300:161"/>
true light of a mean employ'd to bring about ſome end; and in this light refuſes to give force to it, farther than as conducive to the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red end. In all matters whatever, as well as in matters of law, the end is the capital circumſtance; and means are regarded as far only as they contribute to the end. For a court then to put a deed or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in execution beyond the purpoſed end, involves the abſurdity of preferring the means to the end, of making that ſubordinate which is principal, and that principal which is ſubordinate. Such proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be unjuſt as well as abſurd: no man in conſcience feels himſelf bound to perform any promiſe or covenant, further than as it contributes to the end or event for the accompliſhing of which it was made; and it is inconſiſtent with the very nature of a court of equity, to compel a man to perform any act where he is not antecedently bound in conſcience and duty.</p>
                        <p>A variety of irritancies contrived to ſecure an entail againſt acts and deeds of the proprietor, furniſh proper examples for illuſtrating this article. Irritancies directed againſt the tenant in tail to reſtrain him from deſtroying the entail, are in effect reſolutive conditions; and if ſo expreſſed as to declare the right voidable only, and not void <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> any act of contravention may be purged before challenge, and even at any time before ſentence upon a proceſs of declarator. The difficulty ariſes from clauſes declaring the contravener to fall from his right <hi>ipſo facto</hi> upon the firſt act of contravention. One thing is clear, that the entailer's will muſt be obey'd; and therefore, if his meaning be truly expreſſed in an <hi>ipſo ſacto</hi> forfeiting clauſe, no court can reſtore the tenant in tail againſt the forfeiture. But ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the entailer to have only intended by this forfeiting clauſe to keep his heirs of entail to their duty, which <hi>in dubio</hi> will always be preſumed; it may be doubted whether a court of equity ought not to interpoſe to relieve the tenant in tail from the forfeiture, upon his freeing the eſtate from his debts and deeds. On the one hand, we have the entailer's will declaring that an act of contravention ſhall operate a forfeiture <hi>ipſo facto.</hi> But what weighs on the other hand is, that ſuch irritancies being intended <hi>in terrorem</hi> only, and to preſerve the eſtate entire to the heirs named in their order, the entailer's ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate intention is fulfilled if the eſtate be relieved from the debts and deeds of the tenant in tail, and is diſappointed if the forfeiture be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have its full effect. Here then we have the entailer's will with reſpect to the means contradicted by his intention with regard to the end, ſo as that both cannot be obey'd: which, upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim That the end ought to be preferred before the means, affords a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0743600300:162"/>
fair opportunity for a court of equity to confine the operation of theſe means, ſo as to produce no effect beyond what is ultimately intended. This reſolves into a general propoſition, <q rend="inline">"That where the means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed reach inadvertently too far, it belongs to a court of equity to deny any effect to theſe means beyond what is ultimately purpoſed."</q> And accordingly it is always the practice of the court of ſeſſion, as a court of equity, to ſuſtain the offer of purging or freeing the eſtate, in order to relieve from the forfeiture.</p>
                        <p>The act 1685 concerning tailzies declares, <q rend="inline">"That if the proviſions and irritant clauſes are not repeated in the rights and conveyances by which the heirs of tailzie bruik or enjoy the eſtate, the omiſſion ſhall import a contravention of the irritant and reſolutive clauſes againſt the perſon and his heirs who ſhall omit to inſert the ſame, whereby the eſtate ſhall <hi>ipſo facto</hi> fall, accreſce, and be devolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next heir of tailzie; but ſhall not militate againſt creditors,"</q> &amp;c. If the will of the legiſlature here expreſſed is to be ſtrictly obey'd, the forfeiture muſt take place, without admitting the tenant in tail to ſupply the omiſſion by ingroſſing the irritant clauſes in his title-deeds: nor would the ſtrongeſt evidence given on his part of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or caſual omiſſion, relieve him from the forfeiture. But as the clauſe muſt be conſtructed to be only <hi>in terrorem,</hi> it would contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the ultimate purpoſe of the legiſlature, to give it any effect, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to oblige the tenant in tail to ſupply his omiſſion; for we cannot ſuppoſe that the legiſlature intended to be more rigid in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring entails, than entailers themſelves commonly are. This ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutory irritancy, according to ſtrict order, ought to come in afterward, in treating of equity with reſpect to ſtatutes; but it appears in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light by being joined with the irritancies above mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The irritancies hitherto mentioned relate to grants and ſingle deeds. I proceed to an example of a conventional irritancy, <hi>viz.</hi> an irritancy <hi>ob non ſolutum canonem</hi> contained in a tack or feu-right. Such a clauſe expreſſed ſo as to make the right voidable only upon failure of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is juſt and equal; becauſe, by a declarator of irritancy, it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures to the ſuperior or landlord payment of what is due him, and at the ſame time affords to the vaſſal or tenant an opportunity to purge the irritancy by payment. And even ſuppoſing the clauſe ſo expreſſed as to make failure of payment an <hi>ipſo facto</hi> forfeiture, it will be held by a court of equity, that the means choſen reach inadvertently beyond the ultimate intention of the parties contracters; and a declarator of irritancy will ſtill be neceſſary, in order to afford an opportunity of purging the irritancy.</p>

A ſettlement being made upon a young woman, proviſo, that ſhe marry with conſent of certain perſons named, the conſent to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in writing; a conſent by parole was deemed ſufficient <note n="*" place="bottom">1ſt Modern reports 310.</note>. For writing was required in the way of evidence only; and conſequently it was not underſtood to be the will of the maker to exclude other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that might be equally ſufficient; and far leſs to forfeit a perſon for the mere want of a form when the ſubſtance was preſerved.</p>
                        <p>Conditional bonds and grants afford good examples of limiting means when they exceed juſt bounds. Conditional bonds and grants are of two kinds. One is where the condition is ultimate; as for example, a bond for money granted to a young woman upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her being married to a man named, or a bond for money to a young man upon condition of his entering into holy orders. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is where the condition is a means to a certain end; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a bond for a ſum of money to a young woman upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her marrying with conſent of certain friends named, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of which condition is to prevent an unſuitable match. Conditions of the firſt kind are taken ſtrictly, and the ſum is not due unleſs the condition be purified. This is requiſite in common law; and not leſs ſo in equity, becauſe juſtice requires that a man's will be made effectual. To judge aright of the other kind, we ought to lay the chief weight upon the ultimate purpoſe of the granter; which, in the caſe laſt mentioned, is to confine the young woman to a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able match. If ſhe therefore marry ſuitably, or, ſuppoſe, above her rank, though without conſulting the friends named, I pronounce that the bond ought to be effectual in equity, though not at common law. The reaſon that determines my opinion is given above, that weight ought to be laid upon the ultimate purpoſe, even in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the declared means; and that juſtice is fulfilled when the granter's ultimate purpoſe is made effectual. I am aware, that in Scotland we are taught a different doctrine. In bonds of the kind under conſideration, a diſtinction is made between a ſuſpenſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and one that is reſolutive. If the bond to the young woman contain a reſolutive condition only, <hi>viz. if ſhe marry without conſent ſhe ſhall forfeit the bond,</hi> it is admitted, that the forfeiture will not take effect unleſs ſhe marry unſuitably. But it is held by every one, that a ſuſpenſive condition, ſuch as that above mentioned, muſt be performed in the preciſe terms of the clauſe; becauſe, ſay they, the will of the granter muſt be the rule; and no court has power to vary a conditional grant, or to transform it into one that is pure and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0743600300:164"/>
ſimple. This argument is concluſive where a condition is ultimate, whether ſuſpenſive or reſolutive; but far otherwiſe where the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a means to an end. It is true, that the will of the granter muſt be the rule: but it muſt be his ultimate will or intention, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his will with reſpect to diſproportioned means. Let us try the force of this reaſoning, by bringing it down to common apprehenſion. Why is a reſolutive condition diſregarded, where the obligee marries ſuitably? For what other reaſon, but that this reſolutive condition is conſidered as a means to an end, and that if the end be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the granter's purpoſe is fulfilled? Is not this reaſoning applicable equally to the ſuſpenſive condition under conſideration? No man of plain underſtanding, unacquainted with law, will diſcover any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And accordingly, in the later practice of the Engliſh court of chancery, this difference ſeems to be diſregarded. A portion of L. 8000 is given to a woman provided ſhe marry with conſent of A; and if ſhe marry without his conſent, ſhe ſhall have but L. 100 year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. She was relieved though ſhe married without conſent; for the proviſo is <hi>in terrorem</hi> only <note n="*" place="bottom">Abridg. caſes in equity, chap. 17. ſect. C. 1.</note>.</p>
                        <p>One having three daughters, deviſes lands to his eldeſt, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that within ſix months after his death ſhe pay certain ſums to her two ſiſters; and if ſhe fail, he deviſes the land to his ſecond daughter on the like condition. The court may enlarge the time for payment, though the premiſes are deviſed over. And in all caſes where compenſation can be made for the delay, the court may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the time, though even in the caſe of a condition prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. ſect. B. § 5.</note>. This practical rule is evidently derived from the reaſoning above ſtated.</p>
                        <p>Take another example that comes under the ſame rule of equity. A claim is tranſacted, and a leſs ſum accepted, upon condition that the ſame be paid at a day certain, otherwiſe the tranſaction to be void. It is the general opinion, that where the clauſe is reſolutive, equity will relieve againſt it after the ſtipulated term is elapſed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the tranſacted ſum be paid before proceſs be raiſed; but it is denied that this will hold where the clauſe is ſuſpenſive. In my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, there is an equitable ground for relief in both equally. The form may be different, but the intention is the ſame in both, <hi>viz.</hi> to compel payment of the tranſacted ſum; and therefore if pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be offered at any time before a declarator of irritancy, with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0743600300:165"/>
damages for the delay, the conditional irritancy has had the full effect that was ultimately intended. Equity therefore requires a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarator of irritancy, whether the clauſe be ſuſpenſive or reſolutive; and the defendant ought to be admitted to purge the failure by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing payment of the tranſacted ſum. The caſe, I acknowledge, is different where the tranſacted ſum is to be paid in parcels, and at different periods; as for example, where an annuity is tranſacted for a leſs yearly ſum. A court of equity will ſcarce interpoſe in this caſe, but leave the irritancy to take place <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> by the rules of common law; for if the irritant clauſe be not in this caſe permitted to operate <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> it will be altogether ineffectual, and be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion to make payment. If a declarator be neceſſary, the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant muſt be admitted to purge before ſentence; and if it be at all neceſſary, it muſt be renewed every term where there is a failure of payment. This would be unjuſt, becauſe it reduces the creditor to the ſame difficulties of recovering his tranſacted ſum that he had with reſpect to his original ſum; which, in effect, is to forfeit the creditor for his moderation, inſtead of forfeiting the debtor for his ingratitude.</p>
                        <p>The examples above given coincide in the following point, That the acts of contravention are capable of being purged, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore matters to the ſame ſituation as if there had been no contraven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But there are acts incapable of being purged, ſuch as the cutting down trees by a tenant. Now, ſuppoſe a leaſe be granted with a clauſe of forfeiture in caſe of felling trees, will equity relieve againſt this forfeiture in any caſe? If the act of contravention was done knowingly, and conſequently criminally, there can be no equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in giving relief; but if it was done ignorantly and innocently, a court of equity ought to interpoſe againſt the forfeiture, upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up full damages to the landlord. Take the following inſtance. The plaintiff, tenant for life of a copy-hold eſtate, felled trees, which, at a court-baron, was found a waſte, and conſequently a forfeiture. The bill was to be relieved againſt the forfeiture, offering ſatisfaction if it appeared to be a waſte. The court decreed an iſſue, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the primary intention in felling the trees was to do waſte; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that in caſe of a wilful forfeiture it would not relieve <note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p>IN order to diſtinguiſh equity from common law upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, we muſt begin with examining what power a court of common law has to compel perſons to fulfil their engagements. That this court has not power to decree ſpecific performance, is an eſtabliſhed maxim in England, founded upon the following reaſon. In every engagement there muſt be a term ſpecified for performance: before that term there can be no demand for performance, nor any proceſs brought upon that head; and after the term is paſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance at that preciſe term becomes impreſtable. A court of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, confined to the words of a deed or covenant, hath not power to ſubſtitute equivalents; and therefore all that can be done by ſuch a court, is to award damages againſt the party who fails to perform. Even a bond of borrowed money is not an exception; for after the term of payment, the ſum is ordered to be paid by a court of common law, not as performance of the obligation, but as da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for not performance. This, it muſt be acknowledged, is a great defect; for the obvious intention of the parties in making a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is not to have damages, but performance. The defect ought to be ſupplied; and it is ſupplied by a court of equity upon a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple often mentioned, That where there is a right it ought to be made effectual. By every covenant that is not conditional, there is a right acquired to each party: a term ſpecified for performance is a mean to aſcertain performance, not a condition; and when that mean fails, it is the duty of a court of equity to ſupply another mean, that is to name another day.</p>
                        <p>To illuſtrate this doctrine, ſeveral caſes ſhall be ſtated with reſpect to the performance of a covenant. In a minute of ſale of land, a term is named for entering the purchaſer into poſſeſſion, and for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the price. By ſome accident, the matter lies over till the term is paſt, without a demand on either ſide. At common law the minute of ſale is rendered ineffectual; becauſe poſſeſſion cannot be delivered at the term covenanted, nor the price paid after that term is elapſed: neither can damage be awarded for non-performance, becauſe neither party has been <hi>in mora.</hi> It belongs then to a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0743600300:167"/>
court of equity to aſſign a new term for ſpecific performance, which is fulfilling the purpoſe of the covenant, and making the rights ariſing therefrom effectual. At the ſame time, it ought not to be overlooked, that the naming a new term for performance muſt vary the articles of the original agreement. The price cannot bear intereſt from the term named in the minute, becauſe the purchaſer was not bound to pay the price until he ſhould get poſſeſſion: nor is the vender liable to account for the rents from that term, becauſe he could not be bound to yield poſſeſſion till the price was offered. Theſe ſeveral preſtations muſt take place from the new term named by the court of equity.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſing now a <hi>mora</hi> on one ſide. The purchaſer, for example, demands performance of the minute of ſale at the term ſtipulated; and years paſs in diſcuſſing the vender's defences. Theſe at laſt are repelled, and the purchaſer inſiſts for ſpecific performance. What doth equity ſuggeſt in this caſe? for now, the term of performance being paſt, the original articles cannot be fulfilled. One thing is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that the purchaſer muſt not ſuffer by the vender's failure: and therefore a court of equity, though it muſt name a new term for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, may, however, if the purchaſer inſiſt upon it, appoint an account to be made upon the footing of the original articles. If the rent, for example, exceed the intereſt of the money, the balance may be juſtly claimed by the purchaſer, becauſe he would have had the benefit of that exceſs if the vender had performed as he ought to have done. But what if the intereſt of the price, as uſual, exceed the neat rent? The vender will not be intitled to the difference; for the purchaſer was not bound to pay the price till poſſeſſion was offered him, and he could not be liable for intereſt before the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſum was due. In a word, the purchaſer has a claim for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the former caſe; becauſe, where the rent exceeds the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he can qualify damage by the delay of performance. But in the latter caſe, where the intereſt exceeds the rent, the purchaſer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of loſing, gains by the delay, and upon that account has no damage to claim. This at firſt view may be thought to claſh with the maxim <hi>Cujus commodum ejus debet eſſe incommodum:</hi> doth it not ſeem unjuſt, that the purchaſer ſhould have an option to claim the rents from the beginning, or only from the preſent time, as beſt ſuits his intereſt? It may ſeem ſo at firſt view, but there is no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in reality: the purchaſer's option ariſeth juſtly from the failure of his party; which ſhows that the foregoing maxim obtains between perſons only who are upon an equal footing, not where
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0743600300:168"/>
the one is guilty of a fault reſpecting the other. I need ſcarce add, that the ſame option which is given to the purchaſer where the vender is <hi>in mora,</hi> is given to the vender where the purchaſer is <hi>in mora.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It frequently happens that ſpecific performance becomes impreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; as where I ſell the ſame horſe ſucceſſively to A and B. In this caſe the performance to A becomes impreſtable after the horſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to B; and therefore, inſtead of decreeing ſpecific perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the court of equity muſt be ſatisfied, like a court of common law, to decree damages, according to the maxim <hi>Quod loco facti im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praeſtabilis ſuccedit damnum et intereſſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This ſuggeſts an enquiry, Whether in awarding damages there be any difference between a court of equity and a court of common law. The obligor being bound to perform what he undertakes, ought from the very nature of his obligation to make up the loſs occaſioned by his failure; and every failure accordingly will afford a good claim for damages at common law. Thus the purchaſer of an eſtate from an heir-apparent, having, along with the diſpoſition, received a procuratory to ſerve and infeft his author, employs his own doer to perform that work. By the doer's remiſſneſs, the heir-apparent dies without being infeft, which renders the diſpoſition ineffectual to the purchaſer. The doer is bound at common law to make up the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer's loſs, though it be <hi>lucrum ceſſans</hi> only. In caſes of that nature, if ſkill be profeſſed, unſkilfulneſs will afford no defence. <q rend="inline">"Proculus ait, ſi medicus ſervum imperite ſecuerit, vel locato vel ex lege Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la competere actionem <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 7. § 8. ad legem Aquil.</note>.

Locati conducti.</note>."</q> Upon this principle the following caſe was determined. An advocate being indebted a conſiderable ſum to his client, wrote and delivered him a bill of exchange for the ſum. Being ſued for payment, he objected that the bill was null, as containing a penalty. It is probable that the advocate was ignorant of this nullity when he drew the bill; but he undertook the truſt of drawing it, and therefore was bound to make it effectual to his client <note n="‡" place="bottom">November 26. 1743, Garden of Troup contra Thomas Rigg advocate.</note>.</p>
                        <p>When a priſoner for debt makes an eſcape, the creditor is hurt in his intereſt, but ſuſtains no actual damage; for it is not certain that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0743600300:169"/>
he would have recovered his money by detaining the debtor in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and it is poſſible he may yet recover it, notwithſtanding the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape. But it is undoubtedly a hurt or prejudice to be deprived of his expectation to obtain payment by the impriſonment; and the common law gives reparation by making the negligent jailor liable for the debt, preciſely as equity doth in ſimilar caſes. A meſſenger who neglects to put a caption in execution, affords another inſtance of the ſame kind. By his negligence he is ſaid <hi>litem ſuam facere,</hi> and is ſubjected to the debt. The undertaking an office implies an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to fulfil the duty of the office in all its branches; and negligence accordingly is a breach of agreement, which muſt ſubject the officer to all the conſequences, whether actual damage or any other preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. It ought not to eſcape obſervation at the ſame time, that as neglect merely without intention of miſchief is no ground for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, damages are the only means within the compaſs of law for compelling a man to be diligent in performing his duty.</p>
                        <p>Certain covenants unknown in the common law belong to equity. A bill of exchange was of that nature, till it was brought under the common law by act of parliament; and while it continued in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtate, damages from failure of performance could not be claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but in a court of equity. A policy of inſurance is to this day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known at common law; and conſequently every wrong relative to it muſt be redreſſed in a court of equity.</p>
                        <p>And now as to the rules for eſtimating damage upon failure to perform a covenant. A failure to perform any duty, whether ariſing from a covenant or not, is a fault only, not a crime; and therefore, according to what is laid down above <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 78. 79.</note>, no conſequential damage that is uncertain ought to be claimed. There is the greater reaſon for this moderation with reſpect to covenants, where the failure is frequently occaſioned by a very ſlight fault, and ſometimes by inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity without any fault. This rule is adopted by the writers on the Roman law: <q rend="inline">"Cum per venditorem ſteterit quo minus rem tradat, omnis utilitas emptoris in aeſtimationem venit: quae modo circa ipſam rem conſiſtit. Neque enim, ſi potuit ex vino puta negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, et lucrum facere, id aeſtimandum eſt, non magis quam ſi triti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum emerit, et ob eam rem quod non ſit traditum, familia ejus fame laboraverit: nam pretium tritici, non ſervorum fame necato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, conſequitur <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 21. § 3.

                        </p>
                        <p>In comparing the rule laid down in this caſe for eſtimating damage, with that mentioned above concerning a jailor and a meſſenger, there is an appearance as if uncertain damage, rejected in the former, were admitted in the latter; and this may be thought an inconſiſtency in the rule here laid down for eſtimating damage. But this difficulty will be removed by a ſingle obſervation, That uncertain damage is not admitted in either caſe. The riſk a creditor runs upon eſcape of his priſoner is extremely certain, however uncertain the conſequences may be. It is this riſk only that is eſtimated; and it is eſtimated in the moſt accurate manner, by relieving the creditor from it, and laying it upon the jailor or meſſenger.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, with reſpect to damages from breach of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, it appears that there is no defect in common law to make the interpoſition of equity neceſſary. And this obſervation, it is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, will hold alſo with reſpect to deeds.</p>

                        <p>MANY obligations are of ſuch a nature as to admit no medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween complete performance and total failure. As to other obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there may be a partial performance, and conſequently a failure that is but partial. A bargain and ſale of a horſe, for a price certain, furniſheth an example of each kind. The vender's performance is indiviſible: if he deliver not the horſe, his failure is total. The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon the purchaſer to pay the price, admits a performance by parts: if he have paid any part of the price, his performance is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and his failure partial.</p>
                        <p>Many obligations <hi>ad facta praeſtanda</hi> admit a medium between com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete performance and total failure.

                        <p>In caſes of this kind the queſtion is, What ſhall be the legal effect of a partial failure? With reſpect to common law the anſwer is eaſy: taking the bargain ſtrictly, I am not bound to pay the price or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges till my party have performed his part of the bargain, that is, the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0743600300:171"/>
whole of what he became bound to perform. But in order to anſwer the queſtion with reſpect to equity, a culpable failure muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from a failure occaſioned by accident or misfortune. In the former caſe a court of equity will give no relief; it being a general rule, That no claim is ſuſtained in equity where the claim is occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fault of the claimant himſelf. But in the latter caſe, a claim will be ſuſtained for a part of the price or wages, in proportion to the performance, upon the principle <hi>Nemo debet locupletari aliena jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura.</hi> Thus, if a man undertake to build me a houſe for a certain price, according to a plan concerted, and die before the houſe be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly completed, his repreſentatives will in equity be intitled to a part of the price, in proportion to the quantity of work done; for in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to that quantity I am <hi>locupletior aliena jactura.</hi> Thus, in the caſe above mentioned, if the waggoner die at Newcaſtle, or be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by other accident from completing his journey, he or his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors will have a claim againſt his employer <hi>pro rata itineris.</hi> And upon the ſame principle the freight is due <hi>pro rata itineris;</hi> which was found in the caſe Lutwidge contra Gray <note n="*" place="bottom">Abridged in the Dictionary under the title <hi>Periculum.</hi>

                        <p>A proceſs was lately brought before the court of ſeſſion upon the following fact. Mariners were hired at Glaſgow to perform a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding voyage to Newfoundland, from thence to Liſbon, and from Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon to Clyde; a certain ſum <hi>per</hi> month for wages, to be paid when the voyage ſhould be completed. The Glaſgow cargo was ſafely landed in Newfoundland; and a cargo of fiſh, received there, was delivered at Liſbon. In the homeward paſſage, the ſhip, with the Liſbon cargo, was taken by a French privateer; and the mariners, when they obtained their liberty, demanded their wages <hi>pro rata iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris.</hi> This cauſe was compromiſed; but from what is ſaid, mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſtand evidently upon the ſame footing with a waggoner, or an owner of a freighted ſhip. And accordingly, it is a common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the freight is the mother of the ſeamens wages; meaning, that if the former be due, the latter muſt alſo be due.</p>

                     <head>SECT. VI. Indirect means uſed to evade performance.</head>
                     <p>AMong perſons who are ſway'd by intereſt more than by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the employing indirect means to evade the effect of their engagements, is far from being rare. Such conduct, as being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that candor and <hi>bona fides</hi> which is requiſite in contracting, and in performing contracts, is morally wrong; and a court of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be watchful to diſappoint every attempt of that nature. Thus, if a man, ſubjected to a thirlage of all the oats growing on his farm that he ſhall have occaſion to grind, ſell his own product of oats, and buy meal for the uſe of his family, with no other view but to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the thirlage, this is a wrong <hi>contra bonam fidem contractus,</hi> which will ſubject him to the multure that would have been due for grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oats of his own farm. The following caſe is an example of the ſame kind. A gentleman being abroad, and having no proſpect of children, two of his neareſt relations agreed privately, that if the eſtate ſhould be diſponed to either, the other was to have a certain ſhare. The gentleman, ignorant of this agreement, ſettled his eſtate upon one of them, reſerving a power to alter. The diſponee ſent his ſon privately to Denmark, where the gentleman reſided: upon which the former deed was recalled, and a new ſettlement made upon the ſon. In a proceſs after the gentleman's death for performance of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the defence was, That the agreement did not take place, as the diſpoſition was not in favour of the defendant, but of his ſon. The court found, That the defendant had acted fraudulently, in obtaining an alteration of the ſettlement in order to evade performance of the agreement; and that no man in conſcience can take benefit by his own fraud. For which reaſon he was decreed to fulfil the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as if the alteration had not been made <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, July 15. 1681, Campbell contra Moir.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Upon the ſame foundation reſts the following rule, That a court of equity will not ſuſtain any objection which is calculated by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector to evade an obligation he is under to the perſon againſt whom the objection is made. This rule will be explained by the following examples. In a ranking, a creditor claimed preference upon the debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's eſcheat, becauſe it had fallen by a denunciation upon his horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Anſwered, That there was no eſcheat, the debtor being relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0743600300:173"/>
and that though the relaxation was informal, yet the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had conſented to it. The court would not permit the creditor to evade the effect of his conſent, by inſiſting upon the informality of the relaxation; and for that reaſon found him excluded <hi>perſonali ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectione</hi> from objecting to the relaxation <note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes, February 10. 1710, Wallace contra creditors of Spot.</note>. In a competition between two annualrenters, the firſt of whom was bound to the ſecond as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner; the firſt claiming preference, it was objected by the other, that it was unjuſt in the cautioner to uſe his preferable infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for excluding a creditor whoſe debt he was bound to pay. The court refuſed to ſuſtain this perſonal objection; leaving the ſecond annualrenter to inſiſt perſonally againſt the firſt as cautioner <note n="†" place="bottom">Forbes, June 28. 1711, Baird contra Mortimer.</note>. This was acting as a court of common law, not as a court of equity: for it was undoubtedly a moral wrong in the firſt annualrenter to lay hold of any means to evade or even to delay performance of his cautionary obligement; and the court ought to have repreſſed this moral wrong, by ſuſtaining the perſonal objection againſt him. A cautioner for a curator being ſued for a ſum levied by the curator, <hi>curatorio nomine,</hi> objected, That the curator had no right by reaſon of a prior act of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory ſtanding unreduced. It being againſt conſcience for a man thus to evade performance of his own engagement, the cautioner was repelled <hi>perſonali objectione</hi> from pleading the defence <note n="‡" place="bottom">Dury, December 5. 1627, Rollock contra Croſbies.</note>. A verbal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to diſpone land is not made effectual in equity; becauſe a court of equity cannot overturn common law, which gives a power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unleſs writ be interpoſed. But a purchaſer inſiſting for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a diſpoſition of land granted to him, and the diſponer defending himſelf upon a nullity in the diſpoſition; the court found, That the defendant was barred <hi>perſonali objectione</hi> from objecting the nullity, becauſe he had verbally agreed to ratify the diſpoſition <note n="‖" place="bottom">February 22. 1745, Chriſties contra Chriſtie.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing conſidered in a proceſs is the purſuer's title; and where the title is inſufficient, it is the province of the judge to refuſe proceſs, even though no objection be made by the defendant. Hence it follows, that the defendant cannot be barred <hi>perſonali objectione</hi> from objecting to the purſuer's title. Thus, againſt a poinding of the ground, which cannot proceed but upon an infeftment, it being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That the purſuer was not infeft; it was anſwered, That the defendant, who is the ſuperior, is bound by the feudal contract to infeft the purſuer, and had been charged to that effect; and that he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0743600300:174"/>
could not move an objection which aroſe from his own fault. The court judged, That it is <hi>pars judicis</hi> to refuſe to ſuſtain action without a good title; and therefore that no perſonal objection againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant can ſupply the want of a title <note n="*" place="bottom">Dury, June 20. 1627, Laird Touch contra Laird Hardieſmill.

                     <head>SECT. VII. Repentance in what contracts permitted, and to whom.</head>
                     <p>HAve we in Scotland any action ſimilar to what in the Roman law is termed <hi>Condictio cauſa data cauſa non ſecuta?</hi> Voet, upon the title <hi>Condictio cauſa data,</hi> &amp;c. ſays, That the <hi>condictio ex paenitentia</hi> is not admitted in modern practice, becauſe every paction is now obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. It may indeed appear ſingular, that there ſhould be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of ſuch a nature, as to afford to the one party an exception founded on <hi>paenitentia</hi> merely, or change of mind, and not to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I incline however to be of opinion, that this privilege hath an equitable foundation with reſpect to every covenant that is ſolely or chiefly beneficial to one of the contractors, and of little or no conſequence to the other. For example, I promiſe a man a ſum of money to manumit his ſlave. This man is not intereſted to demand performance of the promiſe, becauſe he gains no more by the money than he loſes by the manumiſſion. Therefore, from the nature of the thing, the privilege of repentance ought to be indulged me. The common law however in this caſe affords me no relief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it knows no diſtinction of parties: but it is the province of a court of equity to afford relief where the common law is deficient.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to covenants in which both parties are intereſted, but the one much, the other little, it appears to me, that the party chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſted may be relieved in equity, if he can ſhow that perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will be prejudicial to him. For example, I bargain with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker to build me a dwelling-houſe for a certain ſum, according to a plan concerted. Before the work is begun, the plan is diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be faulty in many capital articles, and upon the whole to be ill contrived. Am I bound notwithſtanding to fulfil my covenant with the undertaker? This would be hard, and ſcarce agreeable to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of juſtice. Suppoſe again, that, upon a more narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0743600300:175"/>
ſpection into my affairs, the ſum agreed on for building is found to be more than I can afford. Or what if, in the interim, I ſucceed to an eſtate, with a good houſe upon it; or am invited by an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſettle elſewhere? If I am relieved, the undertaker loſes little, being at liberty to accept of employment from others: but if I be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly tied by my engagement, a great intereſt on my ſide is ſacrificed to a ſmall intereſt on his. Covenants, intended for the ſupport of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and to connect individuals by mutual good offices, ought not to be ſtretched to their ruin. The ſole difficulty is, to determine in what caſes a court of equity ſhould interpoſe. This is a delicate point; for it will not be thought that it ought to interpoſe in every covenant that is not ſtrictly equal. It is undoubtedly the ſafeſt courſe to refuſe the aid of the court, unleſs where the circumſtances are ſo ſtrong as to afford a clear conviction of the hardſhip of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
                     <p>Some covenants are of ſuch a nature, and have ſuch important conſequences, that to each party there is <hi>locus poenitentiae</hi> before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. A contract of marriage is one of theſe; and for that reaſon, a bond granted by a woman to marry the obligee under the penalty of a certain ſum, will not be effectual in equity <note n="*" place="bottom">2.

                     <head>SECT. VIII. How far a deed or covenant void at common law can be ſupported in equity.</head>
                     <p>A Principle in logics, That will without power cannot operate any effect, is applicable to law-matters; and is expreſſed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That a deed <hi>ultra vires</hi> is null and void. The common law adheres rigidly to this principle, without diſtinguiſhing whether the deed be totally beyond the power of the maker, or in part only: it is conſidered as one deed, which muſt be entirely effectual or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely void. The diſtinction is reſerved to a court of equity, which gives force to every rational deed as far as the maker's power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
                     <p>This doctrine ſhall be illuſtrated by proper examples. If one having power to grant a leaſe for ten years grants it for twenty, the leaſe is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0743600300:176"/>
in equity good for ten years <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Chancery caſes 23.</note>. For here there can be no doubt about will; and juſtice requires, that the leaſe ſtand good as long as will is ſupported by power. A tack ſet by a parſon for more than three years without conſent of the patron, is at common law void totally, but in equity is ſuſtained for the three years <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, July 18. 1668, Johnſton contra pariſhioners of Hoddam.</note>. But a college having ſet a perpetual leaſe of their teinds for 50 merks yearly, which teinds were yearly worth 200 merks, and the leaſe being challenged for want of power in the makers, who could not give ſuch a leaſe without an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate conſideration, it was found totally null, and not ſuſtained for any limited time or higher duty <note n="‡" place="bottom">Stair, July 13. 1669, Old college of Aberdeen contra the Town.</note>. For a court of equity, as well as a court of common law, muſt act by general rules; and here there was no rule for aſcertaining either the endurance of the leaſe or the extent of the duty. Further, a court of equity may ſeparate a deed into its conſtituent parts, and ſupport the maker's will as far as he had power: but here the limiting the endurance and augmenting the duty ſo as to correſpond to the power of the makers, would be to frame a new leaſe, varying in every article from the will of the makers of the leaſe challenged.</p>
                     <p>The ſettlement of an eſtate by marriage-articles upon the heir of the marriage, is not intended to bar the huſband from a ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; nor conſequently to bar him from making rational proviſions to the iſſue of that marriage. Let us ſuppoſe that a man thus bound to the heir of his firſt marriage, makes exorbitant proviſions to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſecond marriage, ſuch as his whole eſtate, or the greater part. This ſettlement is voidable at common law, as a breach of engagement; and it is a matter of delicacy for a court of equity to interpoſe where they have no general rule for direction. Juſtice however demands an interpoſition, that children, to whom the father certainly intended to give all in his power, may not be left entirely deſtitute: nor would it be conſiſtent with common ſenſe, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould ſuffer as much by exceſs of affection in their father as by his utter neglect. In this caſe, therefore, the court of ſeſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes, by reſtricting the proviſions within rational bounds, ſuch as are conſiſtent with the engagement the father came under in his firſt contract of marriage. The court however never interpoſes without neceſſity; and therefore if the common law afford any means for providing the children, theſe means are preferred. This
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0743600300:177"/>
obſervation will be put in a clear light by the following caſe. Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Campbell, by marriage-articles, being bound to provide to the iſſue thereof the ſum of 40,000 merks, with the conqueſt, did, by a deathbed-ſettlement, appoint his eldeſt ſon to be heir and executor; and left it upon the Duke of Argyle and Earl of Ilay to name ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional proviſions to his younger children. The referees having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the truſt repoſed in them, the younger children inſiſted to have the ſettlement voided, as contradictory to the marriage-articles. It was pleaded for the heir, That the Colonel had a power to divide the ſpecial ſum and conqueſt, by giving more to one child and leſs to another; and though the whole happens to be ſettled on the eldeſt ſon by accident, not by intention, yet that this inequality, ſuppoſing it to have been intended, is no foundation for voiding the ſettlement totally, but only to bring in the younger children for a moderate ſhare. The court voided the ſettlement totally; which intitled the children each of them to an equal ſhare of the ſubjects provided to them in the marriage-contract <note n="*" place="bottom">December 22. 1739, Campbell contra Campbells.</note>. The court muſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe where the rigor of the common law deprives the younger chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of all: but in the preſent caſe the ſettlement was void at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law; and the younger children being ſufficiently provided by the contract of marriage, there was no neceſſity for an equitable interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                     <p>It being the profeſſed intention of parties entering into a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to put an end to all the differences that are ſubmitted, arbiters are choſen to fulfil that intention, who are bound by acceptance to execute the commiſſion given them. Hence an award or decreet-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitral is void at common law, if any article ſubmitted be left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, becauſe in that caſe the commiſſion is not executed. This is equitable as well as legal where the ſubmiſſion contains mutual claims, it being groſsly partial to aſcertain the claims of one of the parties, while the other is left to an action. But where the claims are all on one ſide, and ſome of them only determined, equity will ſupport the award, which, as far as it goes, is beneficial to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for it is always better to have ſome of their diſputes determined than none of them. This however goes upon the ſuppoſition, that no objection in equity lies againſt the award: for if a deed be null at common law, a court of equity will never ſupport it, except as far as it is juſt.</p>
                     <p>When arbiters take upon them to determine articles that are not ſubmitted, the award or decreet-arbitral is at common law void,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0743600300:178"/>
even with reſpect to the articles ſubmitted; becauſe it is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as one entire act, which muſt be wholly effectual or wholly void. Equity goes more accurately to work: it ſeparates the articles ſubmitted from thoſe not ſubmitted, and ſuſtains the award as far as the arbiters were veſted with proper powers. Thus, if two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all actions ſubſiſting at the date of the ſubmiſſion, and the arbitrators award a releaſe of all actions to the time of the award, the award ſhall be good for what is in the ſubmiſſion, and void for the reſidue only <note n="*" place="bottom">New abridg. of the law, vol. 1. p. 139, 140.</note>. A decreet-arbitral being challenged, as <hi>ultra vires compromiſſi,</hi> with reſpect to mutual general diſcharges, which were ordered to be granted, though ſome particular claims only were ſubmitted; the decreet-arbitral was ſuſtained as far as it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the articles ſubmitted, and voided only as to the general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges <note n="†" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Dec. 25. 1702, Crawfurd contra Hamilton.</note>.</p>
                     <p>By the act 80. parl. 1579, <q rend="inline">"all deeds of great importance muſt be ſubſcribed and ſealed by the parties, if they can write; otherwiſe by two notaries before four witneſſes, preſent at the time, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by their dwelling-places; and the deeds wanting theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities ſhall make no faith."</q> With reſpect to this ſtatute, it is fixed by the court of ſeſſion, that a deed is of great importance when what is claimed upon it exceeds in value L. 100. And upon the ſtatute thus conſtructed, it has often been diſputed in the court of ſeſſion, Whether a bond for a greater ſum than L. 100 ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by one notary only and four witneſſes, or two notaries and three witneſſes, be void; or whether it ought to be ſuſtained to the extent of L. 100. A court of common law, adhering to the words of the ſtatute, will refuſe action upon it. And ſuch was the practice originally of the court of ſeſſion <note n="‡" place="bottom">Hope, (Obligation), Nov. 29. 1616, Gibſon contra executors of Edgar.

But a court of equity, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purpoſe of the legiſlature, which is to make additional checks againſt falſehood in matters of importance, will ſupport ſuch deeds to the extent of L. 100: for a deed becomes of ſmall importance when reduced to that ſum, and ought to be ſupported upon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary checks. And accordingly the court of ſeſſion, acting in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times as a court of equity, ſupports ſuch bonds to the extent of L. 100 <note n="‖" place="bottom">Dictionary of deciſions, (Indiviſible).</note>. But in applying the rules of equity to this caſe, the bond ought to be for a valuable conſideration, or at leaſt be a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

                     <p>In the caſes mentioned, there are none who have occaſion for the equitable relief but thoſe only who are parties to the tranſaction. But in many caſes third parties happen to be affected, of which take the following example. A younger brother ſerves heir to his father, and is infeft, the eldeſt having been ſo long abroad as to be reputed dead. He comes home, and claims the ſucceſſion; which <hi>ipſo facto</hi> voids the ſervice and infeftment of his brother; becauſe a ſervice can have no legal effect without a right to be ſerved. In the interim the younger brother has acted <hi>bona fide</hi> as proprietor: and many have been his tranſactions with third parties, who were alſo <hi>in bona fide;</hi> which tranſactions, being founded upon his title of property, are null and void, as flowing <hi>a non habente poteſtatem.</hi> Is there no relief in equity in a caſe of this nature, where the hardſhip on third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is intolerable? One thing is clear, that the <hi>bona fides</hi> of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er brother will ſecure him againſt a claim for the rents conſumed. On the other hand, it is equally clear, that no ſale made by him can be effectual, unleſs as far as neceſſary for payment of the family-debts; to which extent a ſale may be ſupported in equity. The only general rule is, That equity will ſupport every act of ordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; but that acts of extraordinary adminiſtration will not be effectual, except ſuch as being prudent and rational are beneficial to the righteous heir. Upon that rule the court proceeded in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous caſe of Miſſiniſh, who being the only heir in being at the time, was admitted to ſerve, though there was a nearer heir in poſſibility, who afterward exiſted. Miſſiniſh, by his ſervice and infeftment, was only a conditional proprietor, his right depending on the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or non-exiſtence of a nearer heir; and as a nearer heir came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exiſtence, Miſſiniſh's right was null <hi>a principio.</hi> But he having ſold land for payment of the family-debts while there was yet no proſpect of a nearer heir, the ſale was ſupported by the court of ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon evidence brought that it was <hi>in rem verſum</hi> of the true heir.</p>
                     <p>Similar is the caſe of Count Antonius Leſlie, an alien, who was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0743600300:180"/>
ſerved and infeft in the eſtate of Balquhain, as next heir of entail; for an alien at that time was thought capable to inherit land in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But his title being afterward challenged upon that ground by Peter Leſlie-Grant, the next ſubſtitute, the reaſon of reduction was ſuſtained in the court of ſeſſion, and in the houſe of Lords. During his poſſeſſion he had ſold many trees come to maturity, the price of which he had received. And he was protected from accounting for articles of this ſort that happened while he was <hi>in bona fide.</hi>

                     <p>The famous caſe of Barbarius Philippus<note n="*" place="bottom">l. 3. De oſſicio praet.</note> is an inſtance of the ſame kind.

                     <p>IN January 1755, Foſter and Duncan ſet to Adamſon and William<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a ſalmon-fiſhing in the river Tay oppoſite to Errol, on the north ſide of a ſhallow named the <hi>Guinea-bank,</hi> to endure for five years. The river there is broad; but the current, being narrow, paſſed at that time along the north ſide of the ſaid bank, the reſt of the river being dead water. As one cannot fiſh with profit but in the current, the tackſmen made large profits the firſt two years, and were not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers the third; but the fourth year the current changed, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens in that river, and inſtead of paſſing as formerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the north ſide of the bank, paſſed along the ſouth ſide, which was a part of the river ſet to other tackſmen; by which means the fiſhing ſet to Adamſon and Williamſon became entirely unprofitable the remainder of their leaſe.</p>
                     <p>The granters of the tack having brought a proceſs againſt the tackſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for L. 36 Sterling, being the tack-duty for the two laſt years, the defence was a total ſterility by the change of the current as aforeſaid;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0743600300:181"/>
and a proof being taken, the facts appeared to be what are above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>It was admitted for the purſuers, that the extinction of the ſubject muſt have the effect even at common law to put an end to the leaſe; becauſe the leaſe having a ſpecial relation to a ſubject which is to be poſſeſſed for rent, it cannot ſubſiſt when there remains no ſubject that can be poſſeſſed; as for example, when land is ſwallowed up by the ſea, or when a river totally changes its courſe, and never returns to its former channel. The caſe is different in ſterility, whether of land or of fiſhing; for there the ſubject remaining in exiſtence, is ſtill ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be poſſeſſed by the leſſee; and conſequently the leaſe ſubſiſts, and the rent is due, however unprofitable the poſſeſſion may be. If therefore there be any relief in the caſe of ſterility, it muſt be upon equitable conſiderations; and whatever may be thought with reſpect to a total ſterility during the whole years of the leaſe, or during the remaining years after the leaſe is offered to be given up, the ſterility here was temporary only: for as the ſtream of the river Tay is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely changeable, it might have returned to its former place in a month or in a week; and as the tackſmen adhered to the tack, and did not offer to ſurrender the poſſeſſion, they certainly were in daily expectation that the current would take its former courſe. That ſuch a temporary ſterility cannot afford a defence in equity againſt payment of the rent, will appear from the following conſiderations. <hi>Primo,</hi> A leaſe puts the leſſee in place of the landlord as to profit and loſs; the profit is his without limitation, and ſo ought the loſs: <hi>Cujus commodum ejus debet eſſe incommodum</hi> is a rule in equity that holds with the greateſt force in a leaſe where the leſſee draws all the profit, if it ſhould be ten times his rent, and on the other hand can never loſe more than his rent. <hi>Secundo,</hi> There can be no equity in the defence after the leaſe is at an end. For at that rate the tenant has a fine game to play: if the ſterility continue to the end of the leaſe, the tenant takes advantage of the equitable defence to get free of the rent; but if fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs be reſtored, he takes advantage of the leaſe, and makes all the profit he can. The landlord by this means continues bound while the tenant is free, which is repugnant to all the rules of equity as well as of common law. <hi>Tertio,</hi> At any rate the tenant cannot pick out one or other ſterile year to get free of that year's rent: if equity afford him any deduction, it muſt be upon a calculation of the whole years of the leaſe; for if he be a gainer upon the whole, which is the preſent caſe, he has no claim in equity for any deduction. It was carried, however, by a plurality to ſuſtain the defence of ſterility,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0743600300:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to aſſoilzie the defenders from the rent due for the laſt two years of the tack.</p>
                     <p>This judgement ſeems not better founded in equity than at common law; and it is eaſy to diſcover what moved the plurality. In a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion between a rich landlord and a poor tenant, the natural bias is in favour of the latter: the ſubject in controverſy may be a trifle to the landlord, and yet be the tenant's all, A caſe may be put oppoſite to that under conſideration. A widow woman with a numerous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of children has nothing to ſubſiſt on but her liferent of a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſe, and of an extenſive orchard. Theſe ſhe leaſes to a man in opulent circumſtances, for a rent of L. 15 for the houſe, and L. 25 for the orchard. He poſſeſſes for ſeveral years with reaſonable profit. The orchard happens to be barren the two laſt years of the leaſe, and he claims a deduction upon that account. No man would give this caſe againſt the widow. So much do extraneous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances influence the determinations of a court, even where the judges are not ſenſible of them.</p>
                     <p>I am not certain but that ſome of the judges conſidered this as a <hi>rei interitus</hi> to afford a defence at common law; a very great miſtake, as a thing cannot be underſtood to be totally deſtroy'd while we have daily expectation of its being reſtored to its former condition <note n="*" place="bottom">Foſter and Duncan contra Adamſon and Williamſon, July 16. 1762.</note>.</p>

                     <head>SECT. X. Where a deed or covenant is occaſioned by error.</head>
                     <p>ERror may be diſtinguiſhed into two kinds. One prevents conſent altogether; as for example, where the purchaſer has one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in view and the vender another. In this caſe there is no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for the parties agree not in the ſame thing. This can only happen in covenants; and as no obligation can ariſe where there is no agreement, ſuch a covenant, if it can be called ſo, is void by the common law; and there is no occaſion for the interpoſition of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The other kind is where the error is not ſuch as to prevent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but is a motive only for entering into an engagement. An er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of this kind may happen in ſingle deeds as well as in covenants; and as here will or conſent is really interpoſed, the deed muſt be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual at common law; and the queſtion is, Whether, or how far, there ought to be a relief in equity on account of the error?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0743600300:183"/>
A maxim above laid down<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 98.</note> will pave the way to the ſolution of this queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That one <hi>certans de damno evitando</hi> may lawfully take advantage of an error committed by another; but that juſtice forbids ſuch advantage to be taken in order to make poſitive gain by it. From the inveſtigation of this maxim in the place cited, it will appear that juſtice makes no diſtinction between an error in fact and an error in law. One difference indeed there is, which belongs not to the preſent head, that an error in law is not ſo readily preſumed as an error in fact.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall begin with ſhowing what influence an error has with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to grants and other ſingle deeds. Some are purely gratuitous, ſome are founded on an antecedent rational cauſe. Such cauſe muſt in all events ſupport the deed, becauſe juſtice will not permit the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to ſeek reſtitution againſt a deed which it was rational to grant. And ſuppoſing him to be bound in conſcience only, a court of equity will not void an honeſt deed, though occaſioned by an erroneous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. A rich man, for example, executes a bond in favour of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent relation, moved by an erroneous belief that this relation had behaved gallantly in a battle where he was not even preſent. Equity will not relieve the granter againſt this deed, being in itſelf rational, and which at any rate is a matter of charity. The creditor, it is true, gains by the error: but then it cannot be ſaid that he lays hold of this error to hurt the granter of the bond, becauſe a man cannot be ſaid to be hurt by doing an act of generoſity or charity.</p>
                     <p>Equity therefore relieves not from error, except with relation to deeds purely gratuitous, ſuch as donations, legacies, &amp;c.; nor with relation to theſe, unleſs where the ſole motive of granting is erroneous. An error the diſcovery of which would not have totally prevented the deed, cannot at all be regarded; for a gratuitous deed muſt be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in whole or voided in whole, there not being here as in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants any meaſure of equality or inequality. With reſpect then to a gratuitous deed where the ſole motive of granting is erroneous, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice requires that the granter be relieved from performance. He feels himſelf not bound in conſcience; and the grantee's conſcience dictates to him, that he ought not to make profit by ſuch error. To this purpoſe Papinian. <q rend="inline">"Falſam cauſam legato non obeſſe, verius eſt: quia ratio legandi legato non cohaeret.

                     </p>
                     <p>The following texts of the <hi>Corpus Juris</hi> are proper examples of this rule: <q rend="inline">"Longe magis legato falſa cauſa adjecta non nocet: veluti

But the circumſtances of the following caſe make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the error was the ſole impulſive cauſe, ſo as to bring it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſaid exception mentioned by Papinian. <q rend="inline">"Pactumeius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſthenes Pactumeiam Magnam filiam Pactumeii Magni ex aſſe heredem inſtituerat: eique patrem ejus ſubſtituerat.

                     <p>With reſpect to the legacies contained in the latter teſtament, againſt which no relief was granted, the opinion delivered appears well founded. For though the teſtator was determined by an erroneous motive to make the teſtament as far as concerned Rufus the heir, there was no evidence nor preſumption that he was determined by the ſame error to make the legacies.</p>

With reſpect to contracts where means are erroneouſly choſen that anſwer not the intention of the contractors, an error of this magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will void the contract: as to which, ſee ſect. 4. art. 1. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny error of leſs importance will not be regarded. I purchaſe, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a teleſcope, judging it to be mounted with ſilver; equity will not relieve me from the bargain though the mounting proves to be of a baſer metal. The ſame of a watch, the caſe of which I take to be gold, though it be only ſilver gilt. The ornaments of an inſtrument or machine have no relation to uſe; and if the ſubject purchaſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer its end, the chief view of the purchaſer is obtained. The moſt that can be made of an error in ſuch a caſe, is to found a claim in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity for abating the price in order to make the bargain ſtrictly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; and this was done by the Roman law, which annulls every ſale where the leſion or prejudice is <hi>ultra duplum</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 2. C. De reſcind. vend.</note>. But a claim of this nature, as prejudicial to commerce, is oppoſed by the principle of utility, and for that reaſon is rejected in moſt commercial countries.</p>
                     <p>This affords a good opportunity to illuſtrate the legal effects of a tranſaction. A tranſaction putting an end to any matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy or diſpute, muſt be effectual; for a deed will never be preſumed to proceed from error, where there is a juſt or rational motive for making it. On the other hand, if a man be moved to make a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action upon ſuppoſition of a claim which has no foundation, an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of this kind will undoubtedly entitle him to be relieved in equity. <q rend="inline">"Si ex falſis inſtrumentis tranſactiones vel pactiones initae fuerint, quamvis jusjurandum de his interpoſitum ſit, etiam civiliter falſo revelato, eas retractari praecipimus; ita demum, ut ſi de pluribus cauſis vel capitulis eaedem pactiones ſeu tranſactiones initae fuerint, illa tantummodo cauſa vel pars retractetur, quae ex falſo inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to compoſito convicta fuerit, aliis capitulis firmis manentibus <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 42.

                     <p>One indeed may be moved by error to make an unequal tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which would be corrected by equity did not utility ſtand in the way; for to extinguiſh law-ſuits and controverſies, the great ſource of idleneſs and diſcord, is not advantageous to thoſe only who deal in commerce, but to all. Upon this account no inequality, however great, ought to be regarded in a tranſaction where there is no other cauſe for giving relief. An interpoſition, even in the ſtrongeſt caſe, muſt give encouragement to law-ſuits; for if one obtain redreſs, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will hope for it who have not ſo good a claim. It will have ſtill a worſe effect, by making judges arbitrary, who in ſuch a caſe can have no general rule to direct their decrees.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Powers of a court of equity to remedy what is imperfect in common law with reſpect to ſtatutes.</head>
                  <p>COnſidering the limited nature of a court of common law, there is no reaſon that it ſhould have more power over ſtatutes than over private deeds. With reſpect to both it is confined to the words, and muſt not pretend to pronounce any judgement upon the ſpirit and meaning in oppoſition to the words. And yet the words of a ſtatute correſpond not always to the will of the legiſlature; nor are the things enacted proper means always to anſwer the end in view; fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes ſhort of the end, and ſometimes going beyond it. Hence in making ſtatutes effectual, there is the ſame neceſſity for the interpoſition of a court of equity to ſupply defects and correct exceſſes, that there is in making deeds and covenants effectual. But in order to form a juſt notion of the powers of a court of equity with reſpect to ſtatutes, it is neceſſary, as a preliminary point, to aſcertain how far they come under the powers of a court of common law; and with that point I ſhall commence the inquiry.</p>
                  <p>Submiſſion to a regular government is univerſally acknowledged to be a duty: but the true foundation of this duty ſeems to lie in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though ſcarce any other topic has filled more volumes. Many writers derive this duty from an original compact between the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and his people. Be it ſo. But then, what binds thoſe who follow in ſucceſſion? for a compact binds thoſe only who are parties to it; not to mention that governments were eſtabliſhed long before contracts were of any conſiderable authority <note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 2.</note>. Others, diſſatisfied with this narrow foundation, endeavour to aſſign one more extenſive, deriving the foregoing duty from what is termed in the Roman law a <hi>quaſi-contract.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">"It is a rule," they ſay, "in law, and in common ſenſe, That a man who lays hold of a benefit, muſt take it with its conditions, and ſubmit to its neceſſary conſequences. Thus one who accepts a ſucceſſion, muſt pay the anceſtor's debts: he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to agree to this condition, and is not leſs firmly bound than by an explicit engagement. In point of government, protection and ſubmiſſion are reciprocal; and the taking protection from a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0743600300:187"/>
government, infers a conſent to ſubmit to its laws."</q> This ground of ſubmiſſion is not much more extenſive than the former; for both proceed upon the ſuppoſition, that without conſent expreſs'd or imply'd no perſon owes obedience to government. At this rate, the greater part of thoſe who live under government are left in a ſtate of independency; for ſeldom is there occaſion to afford ſuch peculiar protection to private perſons, as neceſſarily to infer their conſent. In fact, the far greater part of thoſe who live in ſociety, are not capable to underſtand the foregoing reaſoning: many of them have not even the ſlighteſt notion of what is meant by the terms <hi>protection</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi> I am inclined therefore to think, that this important duty has a more ſolid foundation; and, comparing it with other moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I find no reaſon to doubt, that, like them, it is deeply rooted in human nature <note n="*" place="bottom">See Eſſays on the principles of morality and natural religion, part 1. eſſ. 2. chap. 7.</note>. If a man be a ſocial being, and government eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to ſociety, it is not conformable to the analogy of nature, that we ſhould be left to an argument for inveſtigating the duty we owe our rulers. If juſtice, veracity, gratitude, and other private duties, be ſupported and inforc'd by the moral ſenſe, it would be ſtrange that nature ſhould be deficient with reſpect to the public duty only. But nature is not deficient in any branch of the human conſtitution: go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is not leſs neceſſary to ſociety, than ſociety to man; and by the very frame of our nature we are fitted for government as well as for ſociety. To form originally a ſtate or ſociety under government, there can be no means, it is true, other than compact; but this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is far from being ſufficient to ſupport a ſtate after it is formed, and to preſerve it for any courſe of time. The continuance of a ſtate, and of government over multitudes who never have occaſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſubmiſſion, muſt depend on a different principle. The moral ſenſe, which binds individuals to be juſt to each other, binds them equally to ſubmit to the laws of their ſociety; and we have a clear conviction that this is our duty. The ſtrength of this conviction is no where more viſible than in a diſciplined army. There the duty of ſubmiſſion is exerted every moment at the hazard of life; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently where the hazard is imminent, and death almoſt certain. In a word, what reaſon ſhows to be neceſſary in ſociety, is, by the moral ſenſe, made an indiſpenſable duty. We have a ſenſe of fitneſs and rectitude in ſubmitting to the laws of our ſociety; and we have a ſenſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0743600300:188"/>
of wrong, of guilt, and of meriting puniſhment, when we tranſgreſs them <note n="a" place="bottom">In examining this matter, it would not be fair to take under conſideration ſtatutes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to juſtice, becauſe juſtice is binding independent of municipal law. Conſider only things left indifferent by the law of nature, and which are regulated by ſtatute for the good of ſociety; the laws, for example, againſt uſury, againſt exporting corn in time of dearth, and many that will occur upon the firſt reflection. Every man of virtue will find himſelf bound in conſcience to ſubmit to ſuch laws. Nay, even with reſpect to thoſe who by intereſt are moved to tranſgreſs them, I venture to affirm, that the firſt acts, at leaſt, of tranſgreſſion, are ſeldom perpetrated with a quiet mind. I will not even except what is called <hi>ſmuggling;</hi> though private intereſt authoriſed by example, and the trifle that is loſt to the public by any ſingle tranſgreſſion, obſcure generally the conſciouſneſs of wrong; and perhaps, after repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acts, which harden individuals in iniquity, make it vaniſh altogether. It muſt however be acknowledged, that the moral ſenſe, uniform as to the laws of nature, operates with very different degrees of force with relation to municipal law. The laws of a free government, directed for the good of the ſociety, and peculiarly tender of the liberty of the ſubject, have great and univerſal influence. They are obey'd chearfully as a matter of ſtrict duty. The laws of a deſpotic government, on the contrary, calculated chiefly to advance the power or ſecure the perſon of a tyrant, require military force to make them effectual; for conſcience ſcarce interpoſeth in their behalf. And hence the great ſuperiority of a free ſtate, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the power of the governors as well as the happineſs of the ſubjects, over every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that in any degree is deſpotic or tyrannical.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Hence it clearly follows, that every voluntary tranſgreſſion of what is by ſtatute ordered to be done or prohibited, is a moral wrong, and a tranſgreſſion of the law of nature. This doctrine will be found of great importance in the preſent inquiry.</p>
                  <p>Many differences among ſtatutes muſt be kept in view, in order to aſcertain the powers of a court of common law concerning them. Some ſtatutes are compulſory, others prohibitory; ſome reſpect indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, others the public only; of ſome the tranſgreſſion occaſions damage, of others not; to ſome a penalty is annexed, others reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on authority merely.</p>
                  <p>I begin with thoſe which reſt upon authority merely, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing any penalty to the tranſgreſſion. The neglect of a compulſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtatute of this kind will found an action at common law to thoſe who have intereſt, ordaining the defendant either to do what the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute requires, or to pay damages. If, again, the tranſgreſſion of a prohibitory ſtatute of the ſame kind harm any perſon, the duty of the court is obvious: The harm muſt be repaired, by voiding the act where it can be voided, ſuch as an alienation after inhibition; and where the harm is incapable of this remedy, damages muſt be award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is fulfilling the will of the legiſlature, being all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ſuch ſtatutes.</p>
                  <p>But from diſobeying a ſtatute prejudice often enſues, which, not being pecuniary, cannot be repaired by awarding a ſum in name of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0743600300:189"/>
damages. Statutes relating to the public are generally of this nature; and many alſo in which individuals are immediately concerned <note n="a" place="bottom">This branch, by the general diſtribution, ought regularly to be handled afterward, part 2. of this firſt book; but by joining it here to other matters with which it is intimately connected, I thought it would appear in a clearer light.</note>. To clear this point we muſt diſtinguiſh as formerly between compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory and prohibitory ſtatutes. The tranſgreſſion of a prohibitory ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is a direct contempt of legal authority, and conſequently a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wrong, which ought to be redreſſed; and it muſt neceſſarily be the purpoſe of the legiſlature to leave the remedy to a court of law, where the prohibition is not enforced by a particular ſanction. This is a clear inference, unleſs we ſuppoſe the legiſlature guilty of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, <hi>viz.</hi> prohibiting a thing to be done, and yet leaving indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals at liberty to diſobey with impunity. To make the will of the legiſlature effectual in this caſe, different means muſt be employ'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the ſubject. If an act done <hi>prohibente lege</hi> can be undone, the moſt effectual method of redreſſing the wrong is to void the act. If the act cannot be undone, the only means left is puniſhment. And accordingly it is a rule in the law of England <note n="*" place="bottom">2. Inſtit. 163.</note>, that an offender for contempt of the law, may be fined and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned at the King's ſuit <note n="b" place="bottom">If this doctrine to any one appear ſingular, let it be conſidered, that the power infilled on is only that of authoriſing a proper puniſhment for a crime after it is committed, which is no novelty in law. Every crime committed againſt the law of nature, may be puniſhed at the diſcretion of the judge, where the legiſlature has not appointed a particular puniſhment; and it is made evident above, that a contempt of legal authority is a crime againſt the law of nature. But to ſupport this in the preſent caſe, an argument from analogy is very little ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for, as obſerved above, it is obviouſly derived from the will of the legiſlature. I ſhall only add, that the power of naming a puniſhment for a crime after it is committed, is greatly inferior to that of making a table of puniſhments for crimes that may be committed hereafter, which is a capital branch of the legiſlative authority.</note>.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the tranſgreſſion of a compulſory ſtatute order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing to be done, infers not neceſſarily a contempt of legal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. It may be an act of omiſſion only, which is not criminal; and it will always be conſtructed to be ſuch, unleſs, from collateral circumſtances, it be made evident that there was a poſitive intention to contemn the law. Suppoſing then the tranſgreſſion to be an act of omiſſion only, and conſequently no place for puniſhment, the queſtion is, What can be done, in order to fulfil the will of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature? The court has two methods: one is, to order the ſtatute to be fulfilled; and if this order be alſo diſobey'd, a criminal contempt muſt be the conſtruction of the perſon's behaviour, to be followed, as in the former caſe, with a proper puniſhment. The other is, to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0743600300:190"/>
order the thing to be done under a penalty. I give an example. The freeholders are by ſtatute bound to convene at Michaelmas, in order to receive upon the roll perſons qualified; but no penalty is added to compel obedience. In <hi>odium</hi> of a freeholder who deſires to be put upon the roll, they forbear to meet. What is the remedy here where there is no pecuniary damage? The court of ſeſſion may appoint them to meet under a penalty. For, in general, if it be the duty of judges to order the end, they muſt uſe ſuch means as are in their power. And if this can be done with reſpect to a private perſon, it follows, that where a thing is ordered to be done for the good of the public, it belongs to the court of ſeſſion, upon application of the King's Advocate, to order the thing to be done under a penalty. In a proceſs at the inſtance of an heritor intitled to a ſalmon-fiſhing in a river, againſt an inferior heritor, for regulating his cruive and cruive-dike, concluding, That he ſhould obſerve the Saturday's ſlap; that the hecks of his cruives ſhould be three inches wide, &amp;c. it was decreed, That the defendant ſhould be obliged to obſerve theſe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations under the penalty of L. 50 Sterling. It was urged for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, That the purſuer muſt be ſatisfied with damages upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention; becauſe the law has impoſed no penalty, and the court can impoſe none. Anſwered, That it is beyond the reach of art to aſcertain the damage in this caſe; and therefore that to inforce theſe regulations a penalty is neceſſary. For if this remedy be neglected by the legiſlature, it muſt ſupplied by a court of equity upon the principle, That if there be a right it ought to be made effectual.</p>
                  <p>What next come under conſideration are ſtatutes forbidding things to be done under a penalty; for to the omiſſion of a thing ordered to be done, a penalty is ſeldom annexed. Theſe are diſtinguiſhable into two kinds. The firſt regard the more noxious evils, which the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature prohibits abſolutely; leaving the courts of law to employ all the means in their power for repreſſing them; but adding a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty beforehand, becauſe that check is not in the power of courts of law. The ſecond regard ſlighter evils, to repreſs which no other means are intended to be applied but a pecuniary penalty only. Both kinds are equally binding in conſcience; for in every caſe it is a moral wrong to diſobey the law. But then diſobedience to a ſtatute of the ſecond claſs is attended with no other conſequence but payment of the penalty; whereas the penalty in the firſt claſs is due, as we ſay, <hi>by and attour performance;</hi> and for that reaſon, a court of law, beſide inflicting the penalty, is bound to uſe all the means in its power to make the will of the legiſlature effectual, in the ſame manner as if
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0743600300:191"/>
there were no penalty. And even ſuppoſing that the act prohibited is capable of being voided by the ſentence of a court, the penalty ought ſtill to be inflicted; for otherwiſe it will loſe its influence as a prohibitory means.</p>
                  <p>Prohibitory ſtatutes are often ſo inaccurately expreſſed, as to leave it doubtful whether the penalty be intended the only means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the evil, or one of the means only. This defect occaſions in courts of law much conjectural reaſoning, and many arbitrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The capital circumſtance for aſcertaining the difference, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the nature of the evil prohibited. With reſpect to every evil of a pernicious nature, and of a general bad tendency, it ought to be held the will of the legiſlature to give no quarter: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, beſide inflicting the penalty, it is the duty of courts of law to uſe every other mean to make this will effectual. With reſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to evils of a leſs pernicious or leſs extenſive nature, it ought to be held the intention of the legiſlature, to leave no power with judges beyond inflicting the penalty. This doctrine will be illuſtrated by the following examples. By the act 52. parl. 1587. <q rend="inline">"He who bargains for greater profit than 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> ſhall be puniſhed as an uſurer."</q> Here is a penalty without declaring ſuch bargains null: and yet it has ever been held the intendment of this act to diſcharge uſury total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the penalty is deemed to be added as one mean only of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the prohibition effectual. There was accordingly never any difficulty of ſuſtaining action for voiding uſurious bargains, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of making the lender liable for the ſums received by him above the legal intereſt. This then is held to be a ſtatute of the firſt claſs. The following ſtatutes belong to the ſecond claſs. An excluſive pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of printing books is given to the authors and their aſſigns for the term of fourteen years. Any perſon who within the time limited prints or imports any ſuch book, ſhall forfeit the ſame to the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and one penny for every ſheet found in his cuſtody; the half to the King, and the other half to whoever ſhall ſue for the ſame <note n="*" place="bottom">8. Ann. 18.</note>. With reſpect to the monopoly granted by this ſtatute, it has been juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed, that a court of law is confined to the penalty, and cannot apply other means for making it effectual, not even an action of damages againſt an interloper <note n="†" place="bottom">June 7. 1748, Bookſellers of London contra Bookſellers of Edinburgh and Glaſgow.</note>. <q rend="inline">"Members of the college of juſtice are diſcharged to buy any lands, teinds, &amp;c. the property of which is controverted in a proceſs, under the certification of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their office <note n="‡" place="bottom">Act 216. parl. 1594.</note>."</q> The evil here being neither ſo pernicious nor
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0743600300:192"/>
ſo extenſive as uſury, it has been always held the ſenſe of the ſtatute, to be ſatisfied with the penalty, without giving authority to reduce or void ſuch bargains.</p>
                  <p>But though contracts or deeds contrary to ſtatutory prohibitions of the kind laſt mentioned, are not ſubject to reduction, it is a very different point, Whether it be the duty of courts of law to force per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch a contract or deed by ſuſtaining action upon it. And yet this diſtinction ſeems to have been overlooked in the court of ſeſſion: for it is the practice of that court, while they inflict the penalty, to ſupport with their authority that very thing which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited under the penalty. Thus a member of the college of juſtice buying land while the property is controverted in a proceſs, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his office; and yet, with the ſame breath, action is given him to make the minute of ſale effectual <note n="*" place="bottom">Haddington, June 5. 1611, Cunninghame contra Maxwell. Durie, July 30. 1635, Richardſon contra Sinclair. Fountainhall, December 20. 1683, Purves contra Keith.</note>. This, in effect, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſtatute, not as prohibitory of ſuch purchaſes, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as laying a tax upon them, ſimilar to what at preſent is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plate, coaches, &amp;c. I muſt take the liberty to ſay, that there cannot be a more groſs miſapprehenſion of the ſpirit or intendment of any ſtatute than this conſtruction. Comparing together the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes contained in both claſſes, the only difference concerns the means employ'd for making the prohibition effectual; that beſide the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, other means may be employ'd by courts of law to repreſs the more noxious evils, which cannot be done where the evils are leſs noxious. But upon cool reflection every one muſt be of opinion, that with reſpect to the prohibition both claſſes coincide; and that it muſt be the will of the legiſlature to prohibit both equally, becauſe both in different degrees are hurtful to the ſociety in general, or to part of it. This article is of no ſlight importance. If I have ſet in a juſt light the ſpirit and intendment of the foregoing ſtatutes, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of neceſſary conſequence, that an act prohibited in a ſtatute of the ſecond claſs ought not to be countenanced with an action more than an act prohibited in a ſtatute of the firſt claſs. Courts of law were inſtituted to inforce the will of the national legiſlature, as well as of the Great Legiſlator of the univerſe, and to put in execution mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal laws as well as thoſe of nature. What ſhall we ſay then of a court that ſupports an act prohibited by a ſtatute, or authoriſes any thing contradictory to the will of the legiſlature? What elſe can we juſtly ſay, but that ſuch proceeding, repugnant to the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0743600300:193"/>
of its inſtitution, is a direct breach of truſt, by acting in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or defiance of the law? It is a breach of truſt of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though not the ſame in degree, with that of ſuſtaining action for a bribe promiſed to commit murder or robbery. With regard then to ſtatutes of this kind, though a court is confined to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and cannot inflict any other puniſhment, it doth by no means follow, that action ought to be ſuſtained for making the act prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited effectual: on the contrary, to ſuſtain action would be flying in the face of the legiſlature. The ſtatute, for example, mentioned above, concerning members of the college of juſtice, is ſatisfied with the penalty of deprivation, without declaring the bargain null; and therefore to ſuſtain a reduction of the bargain would be to puniſh beyond the words, and perhaps beyond the intention of the ſtatute. But whether action ſhould be ſuſtained to make the bargain effectual, is a conſideration of a very different nature: the refuſing action in this caſe, is made neceſſary by the very conſtitution of a court of law; it being inconſiſtent with the deſign of its inſtitution, to inforce any contract or any deed prohibited by ſtatute. It follows indeed from theſe premiſſes, that it is left optional to the vender to fulfil the contract or not at his pleaſure; for if a court of law cannot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he is under no legal compulſion. Nor is this a novelty. In many caſes beſide the preſent, the rule is applicable <hi>Quod potior eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio poſſidentis,</hi> where an action will not be given to compel perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and yet if performance be made, an action will as little be given to recall it <note n="*" place="bottom">See p. 143.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Pondering this ſubject ſedately and attentively, I can never ceaſe wondering to find the practice I have been condemning extended to a much ſtronger caſe, where the purpoſe of the legiſlature to make an abſolute prohibition is clearly expreſſed. The caſe I have in view relates to the revenue-laws, prohibiting certain goods to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into this iſland, or prohibiting them to be imported from certain places named. To import ſuch goods, or to bargain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their importation, is clearly a contempt of legal authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and conſequently a moral wrong, which the ſmuggler's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ought to check him for, and which it will check him for, if he be not already a hardened ſinner. And yet, by miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the nature of prohibitory laws, actions in the court of ſeſſion have been every day ſuſtained for making ſuch ſmuggling-contracts effectual. <q rend="inline">"Non dubium eſt, in legem committere eum, qui verba legis amplexus, contra legis nititur voluntatem.

                  <p>So much upon the powers of a court of common law with reſpect to ſtatutes. Upon the whole it appears, that this court is confined to the will of the legiſlature as expreſſed in the ſtatutory words. It has no power to rectify the words, nor to apply any means for making the purpoſe of the legiſlature effectual, other than thoſe directed by the legiſlature, however defective they may be. This imperfection is remedied by a court of equity, which enjoys, and ought to enjoy, the ſame powers with reſpect to ſtatutes that are explained above with reſpect to deeds and covenants. To give a juſt notion of theſe powers concerning the preſent ſubject, the following diſtinction will contribute. Statutes, as far as they regard matter of law, and come under the cogniſance of a court of equity, may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two claſſes. Firſt, Thoſe which have juſtice for their object, by ſupplying the defects, or correcting the injuſtice, of common law. Second, Thoſe which have utility for their ſole object. Statutes of the firſt claſs are intended for no other purpoſe but to enlarge the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of courts of common law, by impowering them to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute juſtice where their ordinary powers reach not: ſuch ſtatutes are not neceſſary to a court of equity, which, by its original conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can ſupply the defects and correct the injuſtice of law: but they have the effect to limit the juriſdiction of a court of equity; for the remedies afforded by them muſt be put in execution by the courts of common law, and no longer by a court of equity. All that is left to a court of equity concerning a ſtatute of this kind, is to ſupply the defects and correct the injuſtice of common law, as far as the ſtatute is incomplete or imperfect; which, in effect, is ſupplying the defects of the ſtatute. But it is not a new power beſtowed upon a court of equity as to ſtatutes that are imperfect: the court only goes on to exerciſe its wonted powers with reſpect to matters of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that are left with it by the ſtatute, and not beſtowed upon courts
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0743600300:195"/>
of common law. I explain myſelf by an example. When goods are wrongouſly taken away, the common law of England gave an action for reſtitution to none but to the proprietor; and therefore when the goods of a monaſtery were pillaged during a vacancy, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abbot had no action. This defect in law with reſpect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial juſtice, would probably have been left to the court of chancery, had its powers been evolved when the ſtatute of Marlebirge ſupplying the defect was made <note n="*" place="bottom">52. Henry III. cap. 29.</note>; but no other remedy occurring, that ſtatute impowers the judges of common law to ſuſtain action. Had the ſtatute never exiſted, action would undoubtedly have been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the court of chancery: all the power that now remains with that court, is to ſuſtain action where the ſtatute is defective. The ſtatute enacts, <q rend="inline">"That the ſucceſſor ſhall have an action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch tranſgreſſor, for reſtoring the goods of the monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry."</q> Attending to the words ſingly, which a court of common law muſt do, the remedy is incomplete; for trees cut down and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off are not mentioned. This defect in the ſtatute, is ſupplied by the court of chancery. And Coke obſerves, that a ſtatute which gives remedy for a wrong done, ſhall be taken by equity. After all, it makes no material difference, whether ſuch interpoſition of a court of equity, be conſidered as ſupplying defects in common law, or as ſupplying defect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in ſtatutes. It is ſtill enforcing juſtice in matters which come not under the powers of a court of common law.</p>
                  <p>Statutes again that have utility for their object, are of two kinds. Firſt, Thoſe which are calculated for promoting the poſitive good and happineſs of the ſociety in general, or of ſome of its members in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Second, Thoſe which are calculated for preventing miſchief ſolely. Defective ſtatutes of the latter kind may be ſupplied by a court of equity; becauſe, even independent of a ſtatute, that court hath power to make regulations for preventing miſchief. But that court hath not, more than a court of common law, any power to ſupply defective ſtatutes of the former kind; becauſe it is not impowered ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally to interpoſe in any matter that hath no other tendency but merely to promote the poſitive good of the ſociety. But this is only mentioned here to give a general view of the ſubject: for the powers of a court of equity as directed by utility are the ſubject of the next book.</p>
                  <p>Having ſaid ſo much in general, we are prepared for particulars; which may commodiouſly be diſtributed into three ſections. Firſt,

Where the will of the legiſlature is not juſtly expreſſed in the ſtatute. Second, Where the means enacted fall ſhort of the end purpoſed by the legiſlature. Third, Where the means enacted reach unwarily beyond the end purpoſed by the legiſlature.</p>

                        <p>THE following is a proper inſtance. By the act 250. parliament 1597, <q rend="inline">"Vaſſals failing to pay their feu-duties for the ſpace of two years, ſhall forfeit their feu-rights, in the ſame manner as if a clauſe irritant were ingroſſed in the infeftment."</q> The forfeiting clauſe here is ambiguous: it may either mean an <hi>ipſo jure</hi> forfeiture upon elapſing of the two years: or it may mean a forfeiture if the feu-duty be not paid after a regular demand in a proceſs. Every ambiguous clauſe ought to be ſo interpreted as to ſupport the rules of juſtice, becauſe ſuch muſt be conſtructed the intendment of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature; and that by this rule the latter ſenſe muſt be choſen, will appear from the ſlighteſt reflection. The remedy here provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the obſtinacy or negligence of an undutiful vaſſal, could never be intended a trap for the innocent, by forfeiting thoſe who have failed in payment through ignorance or inability. The conſtruction choſen making the right voidable only, not void <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> obliges the ſuperior to inſiſt in a declarator of irritancy or forfeiture, in order to void the right; which gives the vaſſal an opportunity to prevent the forfeiture, by paying up all arrears. By this method, it is true, the guilty may eſcape: but this is far more eligible in common juſtice, than that the innocent be puniſhed with the guilty.</p>

                        <p>BY the act 5. parl. 1695, it is enacted, <q rend="inline">"That hereafter no man binding for and with another conjunctly and ſeverally, in any bond or contract for ſums of money, ſhall be bound longer than ſeven years after the date of the bond."</q> It appearing to the court, from the nature of the thing, and from other clauſes in the ſtatute, that the words are too extenſive, and that the privilege was intended for none but for cautioners upon whoſe faith money is lent, they have for that reaſon been always in uſe to reſtrict the words, and to deny the privilege to other cautioners.</p>
                        <p>The act 24. parl. 1695, for making effectual the debts of heirs who after three years poſſeſſion die in apparency, is plainly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for debts only that are contracted for a valuable conſideration. The act however is expreſſed in ſuch extenſive terms, as to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend debts and deeds, gratuitous as well as for a valuable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The court therefore, reſtricting the words to the ſenſe of the ſtatute, never ſuſtains action upon this ſtatute to gratuitous cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.</p>
                        <p>The regulations 1695, admitting no objection againſt a decreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arbitral but bribery and corruption only, reach unwarily beyond the meaning of the legiſlature. A decreet-arbitral derives its force from the ſubmiſſion; and for that reaſon every good objection againſt a ſubmiſſion muſt operate againſt the decreet-arbitral. But a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is in its nature a mutual contract; and therefore every objection that in its nature is effectual to cut down the ſubmiſſion as a mutual contract, muſt be equally effectual to cut down the decreet-arbitral founded upon it.</p>

                     <p>An heir, whether apparent only, or entered <hi>cum beneficio,</hi> cannot act more juſtly with reſpect to his predeceſſor's creditors than to bring his predeceſſor's eſtate to a judicial ſale. The price goes to the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which is all they are intitled to in juſtice; and the ſurplus, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be, goes to the heir, without ſubjecting him to trouble or riſk. The act 24. parl. 1695, was accordingly made, impowering the heir-apparent to bring to a roup or public auction his predeceſſor's eſtate, whether bankrupt or not. But as there is a ſolid foundation in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for extending this privilege to the heir entered <hi>cum beneficio,</hi> he is underſtood as omitted <hi>per incuriam;</hi> and the court of ſeſſion ſupplied the defect, by ſuſtaining a proceſs at the inſtance of the heir <hi>cum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficio,</hi> for ſelling his predeceſſor's eſtate <note n="‖" place="bottom">Feb. 27. 1751, Patrick Blair.</note>.</p>
                     <p>By the common law of Scotland, a man's creditors after his death had no preference upon his eſtate: the property was transferred to his heir, and the heir's creditors came in for their ſhare. This was groſs injuſtice; for the anceſtor's creditors, who lent their money upon the faith of the eſtate, ought in all views to have been preferred. The act 24. parl. 1661, made to redreſs the injuſtice of the common law in this particular, declares, <q rend="inline">"That the creditors of the predeceſſor do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligence againſt the apparent heir, and againſt the real eſtate which belonged to the defunct, within the ſpace of three years after his death, ſhall be preferred to the creditors of the apparent heir."</q> The remedy here reaching the real eſtate only, the court of ſeſſion completed the remedy, by extending it to the perſonal eſtate <note n="**" place="bottom">Stair, Dec. 16. 1674, Kilhead contra Irvine.</note>, and alſo to a perſonal bond limited to a ſubſtitute named <note n="††" place="bottom">Forbes, Feb. 9. 1711, Graham contra Macqueen.</note>. And as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a court of equity it was well authoriſed to make this extenſion; for to withdraw from the predeceſſor's creditors part of his perſonal eſtate, is not leſs unjuſt than to withdraw from them part of his real eſtate.</p>

One ſtatute there is, or rather clauſe in a ſtatute, which affords a plentiful harveſt of inſtances. By the principles of common law an heir is intitled to continue the poſſeſſion of his anceſtor; and formerly if he could colour his poſſeſſion with any ſort of title, however obſolete or defective, he enjoy'd the rents; beſtowing commonly a ſhare to prevent the creditors from drawing payment out of the eſtate <note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 12, toward the cloſe.</note>. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many remedies for this flagrant injuſtice, there is a clauſe in the act 62. parl. 1661, enacting, <q rend="inline">"That in caſe the apparent heir of any debtor ſhall acquire right to an expired appriſing, the ſame ſhall be redeemable from him, his heirs and ſucceſſors, within ten years after acquiring of the ſame, by the poſterior appriſers, upon payment of the purchaſe-money."</q> This remedy has been extended in many particulars, in order to fulfil the end intended by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For, 1<hi>mo,</hi> Though the remedy is afforded to appriſers only, it is extended to perſonal creditors. 2<hi>do,</hi> It has been extended even to an heir of entail, impowering him to redeem an appriſing of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed lands after it was purchaſed by the heir of line. 3<hi>tio,</hi> Though no purchaſe is mentioned in this clauſe but what is made by the heir-apparent, the remedy however is extended againſt a preſumptive heir, who cannot be heir-apparent while his anceſtor is alive. 4<hi>to,</hi> It was judged, that an appriſing led both againſt principal and cautioner, and purchaſed by the heir-apparent of the principal, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the creditors of the cautioner. This was a ſtretch, but not beyond the bounds of equity: the cautioner himſelf, as creditor for relief, could have redeemed this appriſing in terms of the ſtatute; and it was thought, that every privilege competent to a debtor ought to be extended to his creditors, in order to make their claims effectual. 5<hi>to,</hi> The privilege is extended to redeem an appriſing during the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, though the ſtatute mentions only an expired appriſing. And, <hi>laſtly,</hi> Though the privilege of redemption is limited to ten years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the purchaſe made by the heir-apparent, it was judged, that the ten years begin not to run but from the time that the purchaſe is known to the creditors. Theſe deciſions all of them are to be found in the Dictionary, vol. 1. p. 359.</p>
                     <p>It is chiefly to ſtatutes of this kind that the following paſſage is applicable. <q rend="inline">"Non poſſunt omnes articuli ſingillatim aut legibus aut ſenatuſconſultis comprehendi: ſed cum in aliqua cauſa ſententia eorum manifeſta eſt, is, qui juriſdictioni praeeſt, ad ſimilia proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, atque ita jus dicere debet.

                     <p>The next branch is of means that are incomplete in every reſpect, where the very thing in view of the legiſlature is but imperfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied. Of this take the following illuſtrious example, which at the ſame time furniſhes an opportunity to explain the nature and effect of an adjudication after its legal is expired.</p>
                     <p>An adjudication during the legal is a <hi>pignus praetorium:</hi> and expiry of the legal is held to transfer the property from the debtor to the creditor; preciſely as in a wadſet or mortgage, where the redemption is limited within a day certain. Yet the rule which, with relation to a wadſet, affords an equity of redemption after the ſtipulated term of redemption is paſt <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 66.</note>, has never been extended, directly at leaſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve againſt an expired legal. This ſubject therefore is curious, and merits peculiar attention.</p>
                     <p>In a poinding of moveables the debtor has not an equity of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the moveables are transferred to the creditor at a juſt value. The ſame being originally the caſe of an appriſing of land, the legal reverſion of ſeven years introduced by the act 36. parl. 1469, was in reality a privilege beſtowed upon the debtor, without any foundation in equity; and therefore equity could not ſupport an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the reverſion one hour beyond the time limited by the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. But the nature of an appriſing was totally reverſed by an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive and diſhoneſt practice of attaching land for payment of debt, without preſerving any meaſure between the debt and the value of the land; by which great portions of land were ſometimes carried off for payment of inconſiderable ſums. An appriſing, as originally conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, was a judicial ſale for a juſt price: but an execution, by which land at random is attached for payment of debt without regarding its value, cannot poſſibly be a ſale for a juſt price: it ought to have been reprobated as without any foundation in law. But indulging it with the utmoſt favour, it would be flagrant injuſtice to hold it for any thing better than a <hi>pignus praetorium,</hi> a ſecurity for payment of debt. Accordingly the act 6. parl. 1621, conſiders it in that light, enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q rend="inline">"That appriſers ſhall be accountable for their intromiſſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the legal, firſt in extinction of the intereſt, and thereafter of the capital;"</q> which, in effect, is declaring the property to remain with the debtor, as no man is bound to account for rents that are his own. And it is conſidered in the ſame light by the act 62. parl. 1661,
<q rend="inline">
                           <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0743600300:202"/>
"ranking <hi>pari paſſu</hi> with the firſt effectual appriſing, all other appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings led within year and day of it:"</q> creditors real or perſonal may be ranked upon a common ſubject <hi>pari paſſu,</hi> or in what order the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature thinks proper; but ſuch ranking is incompatible with the nature of property <note n="a" place="bottom">Stair declares poſitively for this doctrine. <q rend="inline">"An appriſing is truly a <hi>pignus praetorium:</hi> the debtor is not denuded, but his infeftment ſtands. And if the appriſing be ſatisfied within the legal, it is extinguiſhed, and the debtor need not be re-inveſted. Therefore he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive vaſſals during the legal; and if he die during the legal, his apparent heir, intromitting with the mails and duties, doth behave himſelf as heir;"</q> 
                           <bibl>

                     <p>An appriſing then, according to its later model, or, in place of it, an adjudication, is, during the legal, a <hi>pignus praetorium</hi> only, or a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial ſecurity for debt; and the queſtion is, Whether, after this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it be converted into a title of property upon expiry of the legal? The act 1621 above mentioned goes no further than to make appriſers accountable for their intromiſſion within the legal; and if they be not accountable thereafter, the inference ſeems fair that upon that account they muſt be held to be proprietors. This inference, however plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, amounts not to a certainty: it is conſiſtent with the ſtatute that an appriſing may continue a <hi>pignus praetorium</hi> after the legal as well as before, with the following difference, that like a proper wadſetter the appriſer ſhall not be accountable after the legal. But even ſuppoſing the inference to be invincible, it remains to be conſidered how far a court of equity is bound by it. The ſtatute makes appriſers account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able during the legal; but there it ſtops ſhort, and does not ſay that <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> upon expiration of the legal, an appriſing, from a <hi>pignus praetorium,</hi> is converted into a title of property. However clear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may be, it is only an argument drawn by reaſoning, and has no direct authority from the ſtatute: it does not appear that the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature intended this inference, or ſo much as foreſaw it. A court of equity then, though it has no power to overturn expreſs law, is not bound by any argument drawn from a ſtatute, except as far as that argument is ſupported by the rules of juſtice. And in that view we proceed to inquire, what are the rules of juſtice with reſpect to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing or an adjudication after expiration of the legal.</p>
                     <p>According to the original form of an appriſing, requiring a ſtrict e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality between the debt and the value of the land, it was rational and juſt, that the property of the land ſhould inſtantly be transferred to the creditor in ſatisfaction of the debt; but it could no longer be rational or juſt to transfer the property after it became cuſtomary to attach land at random without regarding its extent. The debtor's
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0743600300:203"/>
whole land-eſtate was appriſed, and is now adjudged by every ſingle creditor, however ſmall his debt may be; and therefore to transfer to an appriſer or adjudger the property of the land <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> upon the debtor's failure to make payment within the legal, would be a penal irritancy of the ſevereſt kind. On the other hand, this ſuppoſed <hi>ipſo facto</hi> transference of the property is penal upon the creditor where the land adjudged by him happens to be leſs in value than his debt: in that caſe it would be glaring injuſtice to force the land upon him in payment of his debt. Nay more, it is repugnant to firſt principles, that a man ſhould be compelled to take land for his debt, however valuable the land may be: it may be his choice to continue poſſeſſion as creditor after the legal as well as before; and this muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his choice, if he do no act importing the contrary. To relieve the creditor as well as debtor from the foregoing hardſhips, equity ſteers a middle courſe. It admits not an <hi>ipſo facto</hi> transference of the property, upon expiry of the legal; but only gives the creditor an option, either to continue in his former ſituation, or to take the land for his debt; which option muſt be declared in a proceſs, intitled <hi>a declarator of expiry of the legal.</hi> This removes all hardſhips: land is not impoſed upon the creditor againſt his will: the debtor, on the other hand, has an opportunity to purge his failure, by making pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if he ſuffer a decree to paſs without offering payment, it is juſt that the property be transferred to the creditor in ſatisfaction of the debt; for judicial proceedings ought not for ever to be kept in ſuſpenſe. Thus the law is ſo conſtructed as to make the property be transferrable only, and not to be transferred but by the intervention of a declarator. And the declarator here ſerves the ſame double pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it ſerves in the <hi>lex commiſſoria in pignoribus:</hi> it is a declaration of the creditor's will to accept the land for his money; and it relieves the debtor from the forfeiture of a penal irritancy, by admitting him to purge at any time before the declaratory decree paſs.</p>
                     <p>We proceed to examine how far the practice of the court of ſeſſion concerning appriſings and adjudications is conformable to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of equity above laid down. And I muſt prepare my reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand to expect here the ſame wavering and fluctuation between common law and equity, that, in the courſe of this work, is diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many other inſtances. I obſerve, in the firſt place, That though the court, adhering to common law, has not hitherto ſuſtained to the debtor an equity of redemption after expiry of the legal, yet that the ſame thing in effect is done indirectly, through the influence of equity. Some pretext or other of informality is always embraced to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0743600300:204"/>
open an expired legal, in order to afford the debtor an opportunity to redeem his land by payment of the debt. And this matter has been carried ſo far as to open the legal to the effect ſolely of intitling the debtor to make payment, holding the legal as expired with reſpect to other effects, ſuch as that of relieving the creditor from accounting for the rents levied by him, unleſs during the ten years that the legal is current by ſtatute <note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes, February 2. 1711, Guthrie contra Gordon.</note>. Here is a ſtrange jumble between common law and equity: the freeing the creditor from accounting for the rents after the ten years, ſuppoſes the property to have been transferred to him <hi>ipſo facto</hi> by the lapſe of theſe years: and yet the admitting pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made after the ten years, is ſuppoſing that the property is not transferred before a declarator of expiry of the legal; for upon no other ſuppoſition can payment be forc'd upon the adjudger after the ſtatutory reverſion is expired.</p>
                     <p>In another particular our practice is ſtill leſs conſiſtent, if poſſible, with any juſt principles. With reſpect to the adjudger, it is juſtly held, that the debt due to him cannot be extinguiſhed without his conſent; whence it neceſſarily follows, that, even after the legal is expired, the adjudger muſt have an option, to adhere to his debt, or to take the land in place of it. This rule is eſtabliſhed in our preſent practice; and what man is ſo blind as not to perceive what follows from the rule? An adjudger, upon whoſe will it depends to continue to be a creditor, or to take himſelf to the land in place of his debt, cannot already be proprietor of that land: before the property can be transferred to him, he muſt interpoſe his will, which is done by a declarator; and ſo far our practice proceeds upon juſt principles. But whether what is held with reſpect to the debtor be conſiſtent with that practice, we next inquire. We hold, that the debtor's power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is confined within the legal; that, by expiry of the legal, he is forfeited <hi>ipſo facto</hi> of his property; and that thereafter he has no power to redeem, or to purge his failure of payment. Here we find one opinion inconſiſtent with another, and the ſame inconſiſtence in different branches of our practice: with reſpect to the creditor, the property is not his, till he chuſe to inſiſt in a declarator of expiry of the legal: with reſpect to the debtor again, the property without a declarator is loſt to him <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> by expiry of the legal. Can any man ſay who is proprietor in the interim? Theſe notions with reſpect to the ſame point cannot be reconciled; but the cauſe of them may be accounted for. In all our practice we find a ſtrong leaning to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0743600300:205"/>
in oppoſition to their debtors. A propenſity in favour of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors hath beſtowed upon an appriſer the equitable privilege of an option between the debt, and the land upon which it is ſecured: the rigor, on the other hand, with which debtors are treated, has denied them the equitable privilege of purging an irritant clauſe at any time before the door be ſhut againſt them by a declaratory decree.</p>

It belongs therefore to the court of ſeſſion to limit this ſtatute, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing action if not brought within one year after the offence; for it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was not the intention of the legiſlature to diſtinguiſh Scotland from England with reſpect to preſcription of penal actions. Hence in the deciſion January 19. 1737, Murray contra Cowan, where an action was ſuſtained even after the year for recovering money loſt at play, with the triple value, it clearly appears, that the court of ſeſſion act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a court of common law, and not as a court of equity.</p>
                     <p>The act 6. parl. 1672, requires, <q rend="inline">"That all executions of ſummons ſhall bear expreſsly the names and deſignations of the purſuers and defenders."</q> This regulation was neceſſary in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0743600300:206"/>
the execution with the ſummons. For as at that period it was common to write an execution upon a paper apart, bearing a refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in general to the ſummons, in the following manner, <q rend="inline">"That the parties within expreſſed were lawfully cited,"</q> &amp;c. the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one ſummons might be applied to any other, ſo as to become legal evidence of a citation that was never given. But as there can be no opportunity for this abuſe when an execution is writ upon the back of the ſummons, it belongs to a court of equity, with reſpect to a caſe where the ſtatutory remedy is unneceſſary, to relieve ſo far from the enacting clauſe; which is done by declaring, that it is not neceſſary to name the purſuers and defenders when the execution is writ on the back of the ſummons *.</p>
                     <p>By the 34th and 35th Henry VIII. cap. 5. § 14. it is declared, That a will or teſtament made of any manors, lands, &amp;c. by a feme covert, ſhall not be effectual in law.

                     <p>The ſtatutes introducing the poſitive and negative preſcriptions, have for their object public utility; and the ſupplying defects in theſe ſtatutes reſts upon the ſame principle; a ſubject that belongs to the next book, which contains the proceedings of a court of equity acting upon the principle of utility. But to mitigate theſe ſtatutes with reſpect to articles that happen to be oppreſſive or unjuſt, is a branch of the preſent ſubject; and to examples of that kind I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Common law, which limits not actions within any time, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords great opportunity for unjuſt claims, which, however ill found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed originally, are brought ſo late as to be ſecure againſt all detection. It is not wrong in common law to ſuſtain an old claim, for a claim may be very old and yet very juſt: but to ſuſtain claims with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any limitation of time, gives great ſcope to fraud and forgery, and for that reaſon public utility required a limitation. Upon that principle the ſtatutes 1469 and 1474 were made, denying action up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on debts and other claims beyond forty years. A court of common law proceeding upon theſe ſtatutes, cannot ſuſtain action after forty years, even where a claim is evidently well founded, as where it is proved to be ſo by referring it to the oath of the defendant.

Yet the court of ſeſſion, acting as a court of common law, did in one caſe refuſe to ſuſtain action after the forty years, though the debt was offered to be proved by the oath of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <note n="*" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Dec. 7. 1703, Napier contra Campbell.</note>. In another point they act properly as a court of equity. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under age are relieved from the effect of theſe ſtatutes, for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme good reaſon, that no preſumption can lie againſt a creditor while under age, for delaying to bring his action.</p>
                     <p>The ſame conſtruction in equity is given to the Engliſh act of limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation concerning perſonal actions: it is held, That a bare acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the debt is ſufficient to bar the limitation <note n="†" place="bottom">Abridg. of the law, vol. 3 p. 517.</note>; importing, that the legiſlature intended not to extinguiſh a juſt debt, but only to introduce a preſumption of payment. But with this doctrine I cannot reconcile what ſeems to be eſtabliſhed in the Engliſh courts of equity, <q rend="inline">"That if a man by will or deed ſubject his land to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his debts, debts barred by the ſtatute of limitations ſhall be paid; for they are debts in equity, and the ſtatute hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the obligation, though it hath taken away the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 518.</note>."</q> This differs widely from the equitable conſtruction of the ſtatute; for if its intendment be to preſume ſuch debts paid, they cannot even in equity be conſidered as debts, unleſs the ſtatutory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption be removed by contrary evidence. The following caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon the ſame miſapprehenſion of the ſtatute: <q rend="inline">"It hath alſo been ruled in equity, that if a man has a debt due to him by note, or a book-debt, and has made no demand of it for ſix years, ſo that he is barred by the ſtatute of limitations; yet if the debtor or his executor, after the ſix years, puts out an advertiſement in the Gazette, or any other news-paper, that all perſons who have any debts owing to them may apply to ſuch a place, and that they ſhall be paid; this, though general, (and therefore might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of legal ſubſiſting debts only), yet amounts to ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of that debt which was barred, as will revive the right, and bring it out of the ſtatute again <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the caſe firſt mentioned, of referring a debt to the defendant's oath, a maxim in the law of England is obviouſly applicable,
<q rend="inline">
                           <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0743600300:208"/>
"That a caſe out of the miſchief, is out of the meaning of the law, though it be within the letter."</q> A claim, of whatever age, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the defendant's oath, is plainly out of the miſchief intended to be remedied by the foregoing ſtatutes; and therefore ought not to be regulated by the words, which in this caſe go beyond the end propoſed. Coke<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Inſtit. 106.</note> illuſtrates this maxim by the following example. The common law of England ſuffered goods taken by diſtreſs to be driven where the creditor pleaſed; which was miſchievous, becauſe the tenant, who muſt give his cattle ſuſtenance, could have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge where they were. This miſchief was remedied by ſtatute 3. Edward I. cap. 16. enacting, <q rend="inline">"That goods taken by diſtreſs ſhall not be carried out of the ſhire where they are taken."</q> Yet, ſays our author, if the tenancy be in one county and the manor in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the lord may drive the diſtreſs to his manor, contrary to the words of the ſtatute; for the tenant, by doing of ſuit and ſervice to the manor, is preſumed to know what is done there.</p>
                     <p>The act 83. parl. 1579, introducing a triennial preſcription of ſhop-accounts, &amp;c. is directed to the judges, enacting, <q rend="inline">"That they ſhall not ſuſtain action after three years,"</q> without making any diſtinction between natives and foreigners. Nor is there reaſon for making a diſtinction; becauſe every claimant, native or foreigner, muſt bring his action for payment in the country where the debtor reſides; and for that reaſon both equally ought to guard againſt the preſcription of that country. When ſuch is the law of preſcription in general, and of the act 1579 in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I cannot avoid condemning the following deciſion. <q rend="inline">"In a purſuit for an account of drugs, furniſhed from time to time by a London druggiſt to an Edinburgh apothecary, the court repelled the defence of the triennial preſcription, and decreed, That the act of limitation in England, being the <hi>locus contractus,</hi> muſt be the rule <note n="†" place="bottom">November 1731, Fulks contra Aikenhead.</note>."</q> This deciſion is erroneous, not only for the reaſon above given, but alſo for a ſeparate reaſon. The Engliſh ſtatute of limitation has no authority with us, otherwiſe than as inferring a preſumption of payment from the delay of bringing an action with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſix years; and this preſumption cannot ariſe where the debtor is abroad, either in Scotland or beyond ſeas.</p>
                     <p>If the preſcription of the country where the debtor dwells be the rule, which every creditor foreign or domeſtic ought to have in view, it follows neceſſarily, that a defendant, to take advantage of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0743600300:209"/>
of the country where the action is brought againſt him, muſt be able to qualify his reſidence there during the whole courſe of the preſcription. While the debtor reſides in England, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or in Holland, the creditor has no reaſon to be upon his guard againſt the Scotch triennial preſcription: and ſuppoſing the action to be brought the next day after the debtor ſettles in Scotland, it would be abſurd that the creditor ſhould be cut out by the trien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial preſcription. I illuſtrate this doctrine by a plain caſe. A ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in London furniſhes goods to a man who has his reſidence there. The creditor, truſting to the Engliſh ſtatute of limitation, reckons himſelf ſecure if he bring his action within ſix years; but is forc'd to bring his action in Scotland, to which the debtor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires after three years. It would in this caſe be groſs injuſtice, to ſuſtain the Scotch triennial preſcription as a bar to the action. This never could be the intention of our legiſlature; and in this view the means enacted in the ſtatute 1579 are unwarily too extenſive, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding action after three years, without limiting the defence to the caſe where the defendant has been all that time in Scotland. The ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute therefore ought to be limited to the caſe now mentioned, which will make it correſpond to juſtice and to the intendment of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature.</p>
                     <p>Equity is alſo applied to mitigate the rigor of ſtatute-law with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to evidence. By the Engliſh ſtatute of frauds and perjuries <note n="*" place="bottom">29. Charles II. cap. 3.</note>, it is enacted, <q rend="inline">"That all leaſes, eſtates, intereſts of freehold or terms of years, made or created by parole and not put in writing, ſhall have the force and effect of leaſes or eſtates at will only."</q> In the conſtruction of this ſtatute the following point was reſolved, That if there be a parole-agreement for the purchaſe of land, and that in a bill brought for a ſpecific execution the ſubſtance of the agreement be ſet forth in the bill, and confeſſed in the defendant's anſwer, the court will decree a ſpecific execution, becauſe in this caſe there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of perjury, which was the only thing the ſtatute intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <note n="†" place="bottom">Abridg. caſes in equity, ch. 4. ſect. B. § 3.</note>. Again, whatever evidence may be required by law, yet it would be unjuſt to ſuffer any man to take advantage of the defect of evidence, when the defect is occaſioned by his own fraud. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly there are many inſtances in the Engliſh law-books, where a parole-agreement intended to be reduced in writing, but prevented by fraud, has been decreed in equity, notwithſtanding the ſtatute of

                  <p>IN theſe tranſactions we find daily inſtances of oppreſſion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the creditor, ſometimes by the debtor, authoriſed by one or other general rule of common law, which happens to be unjuſt when applied to ſome ſingular caſe out of the reaſon of the rule. In every caſe of this kind, it is the duty of a court of equity, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, and to relieve from the oppreſſion. To truſt this power with ſome court is evidently a matter of neceſſity, for otherwiſe wrong would be authoriſed without remedy. Such oppreſſion appears in different ſhapes and in different circumſtances, which I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſtinguiſh by arranging them under different heads; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the oppreſſion a creditor may commit under protection of common law, and then proceeding to what may be committed by a debtor.</p>

                     <head>SECT. I. Injuſtice of common law with reſpect to compenſation.</head>
                     <p>BY the common law of this land, when a debtor is ſued for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will afford no defence that the plaintiff owes him an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent ſum. This ſum he may demand in a ſeparate action; but in the mean time, if he make not payment of the ſum demanded from him, a decree will iſſue againſt him to be followed with execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now this is rigorous, or rather unjuſt. For, with reſpect to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0743600300:211"/>
the plaintiff, unleſs he mean to oppreſs, he cannot wiſh better pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than to be diſcharged of the debt he owes the defendant. And, with reſpect to the defendant, it is groſs injuſtice to ſubject him to the moſt rigorous execution for failing to pay a debt, when poſſibly the only means he has for payment is that very ſum which the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff detains from him. To that act of injuſtice, however, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law lends its authority, by a general rule, impowering every creditor to proceed to execution when his debtor fails to make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But that rule, however juſt in the main, was never intended to take place in the preſent caſe; and therefore a court of equity remedies an act of injuſtice occaſioned by a too extenſive application of the rule beyond the reaſon and intention of the law. The remedy is, to order an account in place of payment, and the one debt to be hit off againſt the other. This is termed the <hi>privilege of compenſation,</hi> which always furniſhes a good defence againſt payment where there is a counter-claim. Compenſation accordingly was in old Rome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained before the Praetor; and in England has long been received in courts of equity. In Scotland indeed it has the authority of a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <note n="*" place="bottom">Act 143. parl. 1592.</note>; which it ſeems was thought neceſſary, becauſe at that period the court of ſeſſion was probably not underſtood to be a court of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity <note n="†" place="bottom">See the Introduction.</note>. But perhaps there was a further view, <hi>viz.</hi> to introduce compenſation as a defence into courts of common law; and with that preciſe view did compenſation lately obtain the authority of a ſtatute in England <note n="‡" place="bottom">2. Geo. II. cap. 22. § 11.</note>: the defence of compenſation was always ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the court of chancery; but by authority of the ſtatute, it is now alſo admitted in courts of common law.</p>
                     <p>In applying the foregoing ſtatute introducing compenſation, a court of equity hath more extenſive powers than a court of common law. A court of common law is tied to the letter of the ſtatute, and has no privilege to inquire into its motive. But the court of ſeſſion, as a court of equity, may ſupply its defects and correct its exceſſes. Yet I know not by what miſapprehenſion, the court of ſeſſion, with regard to this ſtatute, hath always conſidered itſelf as a court of common law, and not as a court of equity; a miſapprehenſion the leſs excuſable, conſidering the ſubject of the ſtatute, a matter of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which the court itſelf could have introduced had the ſtatute never been made. I ſhall make this reflection plain, by entering into particulars. The ſtatute authoriſes compenſation to be pleaded
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0743600300:212"/>
in the original proceſs only, by way of exception, and gives no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to plead it whether in the reduction or ſuſpenſion of a decree. The words are, <q rend="inline">"That a liquid debt be admitted by way of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before decreet by all judges, but not in a ſuſpenſion nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the decreet."</q> This limitation is proper in two views. The firſt is, that if a defendant omit or forbear to plead compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the original proceſs, the judgement is notwithſtanding juſt; and the forbearing or omitting to uſe a privilege given by law, is not a good reaſon for challenging a judgement whether in a ſuſpenſion or reduction. The other view is, that it would afford too great ſcope for litigioſity were defendants indulged to reſerve their articles of compenſation as a ground for ſuſpenſion or reduction. Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe views, a judgement purely in abſence ought not to bar compenſation, becauſe judgements are often pronounced when the party hath not an opportunity to appear. For that reaſon, a party who is reſtored to his defences in a ſuſpenſion, upon ſhowing that his abſence was not contumacious, ought to be at liberty to plead every defence, whether in equity or at common law. And yet our judges conſtantly reject compenſation when pleaded in a ſuſpenſion of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in abſence, though that caſe comes not under the reaſon and motive of the ſtatute. The ſtatute, in my apprehenſion, admits of ſtill greater latitude; which is, that after a decree <hi>in foro</hi> is ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any good reaſon, compenſation may be received in diſcuſſing the ſuſpenſion; for the ſtatute goes no farther than to prohibit a decree to be ſuſpended merely upon compenſation. Nor can it have any bad effect to admit compenſation when a cauſe is brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der review by ſuſpenſion becauſe of iniquity committed in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proceſs: on the contrary, it is beneficial to both by preventing a new law-ſuit.</p>
                     <p>If the deciſions of the court of ſeſſion upon the different articles of this ſtatute ſhow a ſlaviſh dependence on the common law; the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which regulate caſes of compenſation not provided for by the ſtatute breathe a freer ſpirit, being governed by true principles of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. I proceed to theſe caſes. The firſt that preſents itſelf, is, where one only of the two concurring debts bears intereſt. What ſhall be the effect of compenſation in that caſe? Shall the principal and intereſt be brought down to the time of pleading compenſation, and be ſet off at that period againſt the other debt which bears not intereſt? Or ſhall the accompt be inſtituted as at the time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as if from that period intereſt were no longer due? Equity evidently concludes for the latter; for it conſiders, that each had the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0743600300:213"/>
uſe of the other's money, and that it is not juſt the one ſhould have a claim for intereſt while the other has none: intereſt is a premium for the uſe of money, and my creditor in effect gets that premium by having from me the uſe of an equivalent ſum. And accordingly it is the conſtant practice of the court to ſtay the courſe of intereſt from the time the two debts concur. But this can only hold where the compenſation is mutual; for a debtor who cannot retain by compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is ſuppoſed to have the money always ready to meet a demand: in which ſituation it would be unjuſt to oblige him to pay 5 <hi>per cent.</hi> premium, or any premium, for money that muſt lie dead in his hand without being put to any uſe; and yet this in effect would be done, were this dead ſum admitted to operate <hi>retro,</hi> ſo as to cut down a debt due to him bearing intereſt. Example. A tackſman lends a conſiderable ſum to his landlord, agreeing in the bond to ſuſpend the payment during the currency of the tack, but ſtipulating to himſelf a power to retain the intereſt annually out of the tack-duty. The tackſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man makes punctual payment of the ſurplus tack-duties, ſo often as demanded: but, by ſome diſorder in the landlord's affairs, a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able arrear is allowed to remain in the hands of the tackſman. The landlord endeavouring to make the tack-duties in arrear operate <hi>retro</hi> againſt the bonded debt, ſo as to extinguiſh ſome part of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal annually, the <hi>retro</hi> operation was not admitted in this caſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in terms of the contract, the tackſman was bound to keep in his hand the ſurplus tack-duties ready to be paid on demand; and for that reaſon it would be unjuſt to make him pay intereſt for this ſum; or, which comes to the ſame, it would be unjuſt to make it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate <hi>retro,</hi> by applying it annually in extinction of the bonded debt bearing intereſt <note n="*" place="bottom">July 21. 1756, Campbell contra Carruthers.</note>.</p>
                     <p>In applying compenſation both claims muſt be pure; for it is not equitable to delay paying a debt of which the term is paſt, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of a counter-claim that cannot at preſent be demanded, or that is uncertain as to its extent. But what if in this caſe the purſuer be bankrupt, or <hi>vergens ad inopiam?</hi> The common law authoriſes a bankrupt to inſiſt for payment equally with a perſon ſolvent: but it never was the intention of the common law to oblige me to pay what I owe to a bankrupt, and to leave me without remedy as to what he owes me. This therefore is a proper caſe for the interpoſition of equity. It cannot authoriſe compenſation in circumſtances that afford not place for it; but it can prevent the miſchief in the moſt natural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by obliging the bankrupt to find ſecurity to make good the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-claim
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0743600300:214"/>
when it ſhall become due; and this is the conſtant practice of the court of ſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Compenſation would be but an imperfect remedy againſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the common law, if it could not be applied otherwiſe than by exception. The ſtatute, it is true, extends the remedy no farther; but the court of ſeſſion, upon a principle of equity, affords a remedy where the ſtatute is ſilent. Suppoſing two mutual debts, of which the one only bears intereſt, the creditor in the barren debt demands his money; which the debtor pays without pleading compenſation, and then demands the debt due to himſelf with the intereſt. Or let it be ſuppoſed, that payment of the barren debt is offered, which the creditor muſt accept, however ſenſible of the hardſhip. In theſe caſes there is no opportunity to apply the equitable maxim, That both ſums ſhould bear intereſt, or neither. Therefore, to give opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for applying that maxim, a proceſs of mutual extinction of the two debts ought to be ſuſtained to the creditor whoſe ſum is barren; to have effect <hi>retro</hi> from the time of concourſe: and this proceſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly is always ſuſtained in the court of ſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>We next take under conſideration the caſe of an aſſignee. And the firſt queſtion is, Whether the proceſs of mutual extinction now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned be competent againſt an aſſignee. To prevent miſtakes in jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of this queſtion, let it be underſtood, that an aſſignment intimated is, by our preſent practice, a proper <hi>ceſſio in jure,</hi> transterring the claim <hi>funditus</hi> from the aſſignor or cedent to the aſſignee. This being taken for granted, it follows, that compenſation cannot be pleaded againſt an aſſignee: for though one of the claims is now transferred to him, that circumſtance ſubjects him not to the counter-claim; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no mutual concourſe of debts between the parties, upon which to found a compenſation.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſuppoſe, that the claim bearing intereſt is that which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. This claim, principal and intereſt, muſt be paid to the aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee, becauſe he is not ſubjected to the counter-claim. Muſt then the aſſignee's debtor, after paying the principal and intereſt, be ſatisfied to demand from the cedent the ſum due to himſelf which bears not intereſt? At that rate, the creditor whoſe claim bears intereſt, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take care by an aſſignment to prevent compenſation. This hardſhip is a ſufficient ground for the interpoſition of a court of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If the cedent hath procured an undue advantage to himſelf, by making a ſum bear intereſt in the name of an aſſignee, which would not bear intereſt in his own name; he ought to be deprived of that undue advantage, to make up what his debtor ſuffers by the aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0743600300:215"/>
And the proper reparation is to oblige him to pay intereſt <hi>ex aequitate,</hi> though the claim naturally bears none.</p>
                     <p>But if the debt aſſigned be that which bears not intereſt, a total ſeparation is thereby made between the two debts, ſo as to bar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation altogether. And what after this can prevent the counter-claim with its intereſt from being made effectual againſt the cedent? No objection in equity can ariſe to him, ſeeing, with his eyes open, he deprived himſelf of the opportunity of compenſation, the only mean he had to avoid paying intereſt upon the counter-claim.</p>
                     <p>In handling compenſation as directed by equity, I have hitherto conſidered what the law ought to be, and have carefully avoided the intricacies of our practice, which in ſeveral particulars is groſsly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. To complete the ſubject, I muſt take a ſurvey of that practice, the errors of which will be the more eaſily apprehended af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what is already ſaid. By our old law, derived from that of the Romans, and from England, a creditor could not aſſign his claim: all he could do was to grant a procuratory <hi>in rem ſuam,</hi> which did not transfer the <hi>jus crediti</hi> to the aſſignee, but only intitled him <hi>procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorio nomine</hi> to demand payment. From the nature of this title it was thought, that compenſation might be pleaded againſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee as well as againſt the cedent: and indeed, conſidering the title ſingly, the opinion was right; becauſe the pleading compenſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a procurator or aſſignee, is in reality pleading it againſt the cedent or creditor himſelf. The opinion however is erroneous, and the error ariſes from overlooking the capital circumſtance, which is the equitable right that the aſſignee, though conſidered as a procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor only, hath to the claim aſſigned, by having paid a price for it. Equity will never ſubject ſuch a procurator or aſſignee to the cedent's debts, whether in the way of payment or compenſation. And as for the ſtatute, it affords not any pretext for ſuſtaining compenſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an aſſignee for a valuable conſideration: it was made to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the common law, by beſtowing the privilege of compenſation as far as juſt and equitable, that is between two perſons who are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually debtors and creditors to each other; but it never could be the intention of the legiſlature, in defiance of juſtice, to make compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation effectual againſt an aſſignee who pays value. Nor muſt it paſs unobſerved, that, as our law ſtands at preſent, this iniquitous effect given to compenſation is ſtill more abſurd, if poſſible, than it was formerly. In our later practice an aſſignment has changed its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is converted into a proper <hi>ceſſio in jure,</hi> diveſting the cedent <hi>funditus,</hi> and veſting the aſſignee. Whence it follows, that, after an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0743600300:216"/>
aſſignment is intimated, compenſation ought to be barred from the very nature of the aſſignee's title, even laying aſide the objection upon the head of equity. But we begun with ſuſtaining compenſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an aſſignee for a valuable conſideration, in quality of a procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator; not adverting, that though his title did not protect him from compenſation, his right as purchaſer ought to have had that effect: and by the force of cuſtom we have adhered to the ſame erroneous practice, even after our law is changed, when now the title of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee protects him from compenſation, as well as the nature of his right when he pays value for it.</p>

                     <p>Every man who has the adminiſtration of his own affairs, may pay his debts in what order he pleaſes, where his creditors inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not by legal execution. Nor will it make a difference, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral debts are due by him to the ſame creditor; for the rule of law is, That if full payment be offered of any particular debt, the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is bound to accept, and to grant a diſcharge.</p>
                     <p>But now ſuppoſing a ſum to be delivered by the debtor to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor indefinitely, without applying it to any one debt in particular, the queſtion is, By what rule ſhall the application be made, when the parties afterward come to ſtate an account? If the debts be all of the ſame kind, it is of no importance to which of them the ſum be applied: otherwiſe, if the debts be of different kinds, one for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bearing intereſt, one barren. The rule in the Roman law is, <hi>Quod electio eſt debitoris;</hi> a rule founded on the principles of common law. The ſum delivered to the creditor, as aforeſaid, cannot indeed be recalled, becauſe it was delivered to him in order for payment; but as there was no agreement about the application, it remains ſtill a ſum belonging to the debtor; which conſequently intitles him to make the application. But though this is agreeable to the rule of common law, it is not agreeable to the rule of juſtice; for if the debtor make an undue application, equity will interpoſe to relieve the creditor from the hardſhip. Equity indeed cannot force a man to give his money out of his own hand; and therefore, in giving it away, he may name what terms or conditions he thinks proper: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0743600300:217"/>
which account, though a debtor acts unjuſtly in applying his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney toward extinction of a debt bearing intereſt, when he is due to the ſame creditor a debt bearing none; yet a remedy in this caſe is beyond the reach of equity. But where the money is already given away, and in the hand of the creditor, the debtor has no longer the ſame arbitrary power of making the application: equity will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and will direct the application. Thus indefinite payment comes under the power of a court of equity.</p>
                     <p>In order to aſcertain the equitable rules for applying an indefinite payment, a few preliminary conſiderations may be proper. A loan of money is a mutual contract equally for the benefit of the lender and borrower: the debtor has the uſe of the money he borrows, and for it pays to the creditor a yearly premium. With reſpect therefore to a ſum bearing intereſt, the debtor is not bound, either in ſtrict law or in equity, to pay the capital until the creditor make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. A debt not bearing intereſt is in a very different condition: the debtor has the whole benefit, and the creditor is deprived of the uſe of his money without a valuable conſideration; which binds the debtor, in good conſcience, either to pay the ſum, or to pay intereſt. Though this be a matter of duty, it cannot however be inforced by a court of equity in all caſes; for it may be the creditor's intention to aſſiſt the debtor with the uſe of money without intereſt: but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt legal expreſſion of the creditor's will to have his money, a court of equity ought to decree intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Another preliminary conſideration is, that where a bond is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a cautioner, the debtor is in conſcience bound to pay the ſum at the term covenanted, in order to relieve his cautioner, who has no benefit by the tranſaction. The caſe is different where the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner ſhews a willingneſs to continue his credit with the principal debtor.</p>
                     <p>We are now ripe for entering into particulars; and the firſt caſe I ſhall mention is, where two debts are due by the ſame debtor to the ſame creditor, one of which only bears intereſt. An indefinite pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought undoubtedly to be applied to the debt not bearing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, becauſe this debt ought in common juſtice to be firſt paid; and there is nothing to oblige the debtor to pay the other till it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. A man of candor will make the application in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and were there occaſion for a preſumption, it will be preſumed of every debtor that he intended ſuch application. But the judge has no occaſion to lay hold of a preſumption: his authority for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the application is derived from a principle of juſtice. The ſame
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0743600300:218"/>
rule directs, that where both debts bear intereſt, the indefinite pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought firſt to be applied for extinguiſhing what is due of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and thereafter for extinguiſhing one or other capital indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, or for extinguiſhing both in proportion <note n="a" place="bottom">The rule here laid down ſeems to be unknown in England. Sometimes it is ſound that <hi>electio eſt debitorit,</hi> and ſometimes that it is <hi>creditoris; Abridg. caſes in equity, cap.</hi> 22. <hi>ſect. D.</hi> § 1. <hi>and</hi> 2.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond caſe ſhall be of two debts bearing intereſt; one of which only is ſecured by infeftment or inhibition. It is equal to the debtor which of the debts be firſt paid: and therefore, the indefinite payment ought to be applied to the debt for which there is the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt ſecurity; becauſe ſuch application is for the intereſt of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor. Take another caſe of the ſame kind. A tenant in tail owes two debts to the ſame creditor; one of his own contracting, and one as repreſenting the entailer. Every indefinite payment he makes ought to be aſcribed to his proper debt, for payment of which there is no fund but the rents during his life. This, it is true, is againſt the intereſt of the ſubſtitutes: but their intereſt cannot be regarded in the application of rents which belong not to them but to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail: and next, as they are <hi>certantes de lucro captando,</hi> their intereſt cannot weigh againſt that of a creditor who is <hi>certans de damno evitando.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Third caſe. A debtor obtains an eaſe, upon condition of paying at a day certain the tranſacted ſum bearing intereſt: he is alſo bound to the ſame creditor in a ſeparate debt not bearing intereſt. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, To which of theſe debts ought an indefinite payment to be applied? It is the intereſt of the debtor that it be applied to the tranſacted ſum: it is the intereſt of the creditor that it be applied to the ſeparate debt not bearing intereſt. The judge will not prefer the intereſt of either, but make the application in the moſt equitable manner, regarding the intereſt of both: he will therefore, in the firſt place, conſider which of the two has the greateſt intereſt in the application; and he will ſo apply the ſum as to produce the greateſt effect. This conſideration will probably lead him to make the application to the tranſacted ſum; for if the tranſaction be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degree lucrative, the debtor will loſe more by its becoming inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, than the creditor will by wanting the interim uſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney due to him without intereſt. But then the benefit ought not to lie all on one ſide; and therefore equity rules, that the debtor, who gets the whole benefit of the application, ought to pay intereſt for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate ſum; which brings matters to a perfect equality between
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0743600300:219"/>
them. For the ſame reaſon, if the application be made to the debt not bearing intereſt, the tranſaction ought to be made effectual, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the term appointed for paying the tranſacted ſum be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed.</p>
                     <p>Fourth caſe. Suppoſe the one debt is ſecured by adjudication, the legal of which is near expiring, and the other is a debt not bearing intereſt. And, to adjuſt the caſe to the preſent ſubject, we ſhall alſo ſuppoſe, that the legal of an adjudication expires <hi>ipſo facto</hi> without neceſſity of a declarator. An indefinite payment here ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for extinguiſhing the adjudication. And, for the reaſon given in the preceding caſe, the ſeparate debt ought to bear intereſt from the time of the indefinite payment.</p>
                     <p>Fifth caſe. An heir of entail owes two debts to the ſame creditor; the one a debt contracted by the entailer not bearing intereſt, the other a debt bearing intereſt contracted by the heir, which may found a declarator of forfeiture againſt him. An indefinite payment ought to be applied to the firſt-mentioned debt, becauſe it bears not intereſt: for with regard to the heir's hazard of forfeiture, the forfeiture, which cannot be made effectual but by a proceſs of declarator, may be prevented by paying the debt. And the difficulty of procuring money for that purpoſe, is an event too diſtant and too uncertain to be regarded in forming a rule of equity.</p>
                     <p>Sixth caſe. Neither of the debts bears intereſt; and one of them is guarded by a penal irritancy, feu-duties for example owing more than two years. In this caſe the feu-duties ought to be extinguiſhed by the indefinite payment; becauſe ſuch application relieves the debtor from a declarator of irritancy, and is indifferent to the creditor as both debts are barren. Nor will it be regarded, that the creditor is cut out of the hope he had of acquiring the ſubject by the declarator of irritancy; becauſe in equity the rule holds without exception, <hi>Quod potior debet eſſe conditio ejus qui certat de damno evitando, quam ejus qui certat de lucro captando.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventh caſe. If there be a cautioner in one of the debts, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debt bear intereſt, the indefinite payment ought undoubtedly to be applied for relieving the cautioner. Gratitude demands this from the principal debtor, for whoſe ſervice ſolely the cautioner gave his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. It may be more the intereſt of the creditor to have the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to the other debt which is not ſo well ſecured: but the debtor's connection with his cautioner is more intimate than with his creditor; and equity reſpects the more intimate connection as the foundation of a ſtronger duty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0743600300:220"/>
Eighth caſe. Of the two debts, the one is barren, the other bears intereſt, and is ſecured by a cautioner. The indefinite payment ought to be applied to the debt that bears not intereſt. The delaying pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a debt, where the creditor gets nothing for the uſe of his money, is a poſitive act of injuſtice. On the other hand, there is no poſitive damage to the cautioner, by delaying payment of the debt in which he ſtands engaged. There is, it is true, a riſk; but ſeeing the cautioner makes no legal demand to be relieved, it may be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he willingly ſubmits to the riſk.</p>
                     <p>Ninth caſe. One of the debts is a tranſacted ſum that muſt be paid at a day certain, otherwiſe the tranſaction to be void: or it is a ſum which muſt be paid without delay, to prevent an irritancy from taking place. The other is a bonded debt with a cautioner, bearing intereſt. The indefinite payment muſt be applied to make the tranſaction effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, or to prevent the irritancy. For, as in the former caſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the creditor, being the more ſubſtantial, is preferred before that of the cautioner; ſo, in the preſent caſe, the intereſt of the debtor is for the ſame reaſon preferred alſo before that of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</p>
                     <p>Tenth caſe. An indefinite payment made after inſolvency to a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor in two debts, the one with, the other without a cautioner, ought to be applied proportionally to both debts, whatever the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or circumſtances of the debts may be: for here the creditor and cautioner being equally <hi>certantes de damno evitando,</hi> ought to bear the loſs equally. It is true, the debtor is more bound to the cautioner who lent his credit for the debtor's benefit, than to the creditor who lent his money for his own benefit. But circumſtances of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot weigh againſt the more ſubſtantial intereſt of preventing loſs and damage.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="section">
                     <head>SECT. III. Injuſtice of common law with reſpect to rent levied indefinitely.</head>
                     <p>BY the common law of this land, a creditor introduced into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon a wadſet, or upon an aſſignment to rents, muſt apply the rent he levies toward payment of the debt which is the title of his poſſeſſion; becauſe for that very purpoſe is the right granted. Rent again levied by execution, upon an adjudication for example, muſt for the ſame reaſon be applied to the debt upon which the execution
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0743600300:221"/>
proceeds. Rent thus levied, whether by conſent or by execution, cannot be applied by the creditor to any other debt however unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
                     <p>But this rule of common law may in ſome caſes be rigorous and materially unjuſt; to the debtor ſometimes, and ſometimes to the creditor. If a creditor in poſſeſſion by virtue of a mortgage or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper wadſet, purchaſe or ſucceed to an adjudication the legal of which is current, it is undoubtedly the debtor's intereſt that the rents be applied to the adjudication, in order to prevent expiry of the legal, rather than to the wadſet which contains no irritancy nor forfeiture upon failure of payment. On the other hand, if the creditor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe or ſucceed to an infeftment of annualrent, upon which a great ſum of intereſt happens to be due, it is beneficial to him that the rents be aſcribed for extinction of that intereſt, rather than for extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wadſet-ſum which bears intereſt. Theſe applications can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made, either of them, upon the principles of common law; and yet material juſtice requires ſuch application, which is fair and equitable, weighing all circumſtances. No man of candor in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his debtor's land by a mortgage or improper wadſet, but muſt be aſhamed to apply the rents he levies to the wadſet, when he has an adjudication the legal of which is ready to expire. And no debtor of candor but muſt be aſhamed to extinguiſh a debt bearing intereſt, rather than a debt equally unexceptionable that is barren.</p>
                     <p>Equity therefore ſteps in to correct the oppreſſion of common law in ſuch caſes; and it is lucky that this can be done by general rules, without hazard of making judges arbitrary. Theſe rules are delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſection immediately foregoing; and they all reſolve into a general principle, which is, <q rend="inline">"That the judge ought to apply the rents ſo as to be moſt equal with reſpect to both parties, and ſo as to prevent rigorous and hard conſequences on either ſide."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this remedy againſt the rigor of common law, ought not to be confined to real debts which intitle the creditor to poſſeſs. In particular caſes, it may be more beneficial to the debtor or to the creditor, without hurting either, to apply the rents for payment even of a perſonal debt, than for payment of the debt which is the title of poſſeſſion. What if the perſonal debt be a bulky claim, that is reſtricted to a leſſer ſum upon condition of payment being made at a day certain? It is the debtor's intereſt that the rents be applied to this debt in the firſt place; as, on the other hand, it is the creditor's intereſt that they be applied to a perſonal debt which is barren. A court of equity, diſregarding the rigid principles of common law,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0743600300:222"/>
and conſidering matters in the view of material juſtice, reaſons after the following manner. An adjudication is a title of poſſeſſion, which, upon failure of payment, impowers the creditor to levy the debt out of the rents of his debtor's land: but if the creditor be already in poſſeſſion, an adjudication is unneceſſary: ſuch a title, it is true, is requiſite to complete the forms of the common law; but equity diſpenſes with theſe forms, when they ſerve no end but to load the parties concerned with expence. And thus where the queſtion is with the debtor only, equity relieves the creditor in poſſeſſion from the ceremony or ſolemnity of leading an adjudication upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate debts to which he has right. And no perſon can heſitate a moment about the equity of a rule, that is not leſs beneficial to the debtor by relieving him from the expence of legal execution, than to the creditor by relieving him from trouble and advance of money. Thus an executor in poſſeſſion, is by equity relieved from the uſeleſs ceremony of taking a decree againſt himſelf for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of debt due to him by the deceaſed: and for that reaſon, an executor may pay himſelf at ſhort-hand. In the ſame manner, a wadſetter in poſſeſſion of his debtor's land, has no occaſion to attach the rents by legal execution for payment of any ſeparate debt due to him by the proprietor: his poſſeſſion, by conſtruction of equity, is held a good title; and by that conſtruction the rents are held to be levied indefinitely; which makes way for the queſtion, To which of the debts they ought to be imputed. The ſame queſtion may occur where poſſeſſion is attained by legal execution, without conſent of the debtor. A creditor, for example, who enters into poſſeſſion by virtue of an adjudication, acquires or ſucceeds to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal debts due by the ſame debtor: theſe, in every queſtion with the debtor himſelf, are juſtly held to be titles of poſſeſſion, to give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the queſtion, To what particular debt the rent ſhould be imputed.</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid ſo much in general, the interpoſition of equity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the various caſes that belong to the preſent ſubject, cannot be attended with any degree of intricacy. The road is in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure paved by the labour beſtowed in the preceding ſection; for the rules there laid down with regard to debts of all different kinds, may, with very little variation, be readily accommodated to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we are now handling. For the ſake, however, of illuſtrating a ſubject that is almoſt totally overlooked by our authors, I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a few rules in general, the application of which to particular caſes will be extreme eaſy. Let me only premiſe, what is hinted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0743600300:223"/>
that the creditor in poſſeſſion can ſtate no debts for exhauſting the rents, but ſuch as are unexceptionably due by the proprietor: for it would be againſt equity as well as againſt common law, that any man ſhould be protected in the poſſeſſion of another's property, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the very time the queſtion is depending, whether he be or be not really a creditor. Let ſuch debts then be the only ſubject of our ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. And the firſt rule of equity is, That the imputation be ſo made, as to prevent on both hands irritancies and forfeitures. A ſecond rule is, That, <hi>in pari caſu,</hi> perſonal debts ought to be paid before thoſe which are ſecured by infeftment. And thirdly, with reſpect to both kinds, That ſums not bearing intereſt be extinguiſhed before ſums bearing intereſt.</p>
                     <p>It is laid down above, that where the legal of an adjudication is in hazard of expiring, equity demands that the rents be wholly aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the adjudication. But it may happen in ſome inſtances to be more equitable, that the creditor be privileged to apply the rents to the bygone intereſt due upon his ſeparate debts: and this privilege will be indulged him, provided he renounce the benefit of an expired legal.</p>
                     <p>The foregoing rules take place between the creditor and debtor. A fourth rule takes place among creditors. The creditor who attains poſſeſſion by virtue of a preference decreed to him in a competition with co-creditors, cannot apply the rents to any debt but what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable before thoſe debts which by the other creditors were produced in the proceſs of competition: for after uſing his preferable right to exclude others, it would be unjuſt to apply the rents to any debt which is not effectual againſt the creditors who are excluded. This would be taking an undue preference upon debts that have no title to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                     <p>It will be remarked, that hitherto I have had nothing in view but the poſſeſſion of a ſingle fund, and by what rules the rents of that fund ſhall be applied when the poſſeſſor hath claims of different kinds. But, with very little variation, the foregoing rules may be applied to the more involved caſe of different funds. A creditor, for example, upon an entailed eſtate, has two debts in his perſon; one contracted by the entailer, upon which an adjudication is led againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed eſtate; another contracted by the tenant in tail, which can only affect the rents during his life. It is the intereſt of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, that the rents be imputed toward extinction of the entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's debt, becauſe they are not liable for the other. The intereſt of the creditor in poſſeſſion upon his adjudication is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0743600300:224"/>
it is his intereſt that the perſonal debt be firſt paid, for which he has no ſecurity but the rents during his debtor's life. Here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is clearly on the ſide of the creditor: he is <hi>certans de damno evitando,</hi> and the ſubſtitutes <hi>de lucro captando.</hi> And this coincides with the ſecond caſe ſtated in the foregoing ſection of indefinite pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>IT is natural to believe, and it holds in fact, that the different execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for payment of debt founded on common law, relate to thoſe caſes only which the moſt frequently occur in practice. Upon a debtor's failing to make payment, his land is attached by an appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, his moveables by poinding, and the debts due him by arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and forthcoming. But experience diſcovered many profitable ſubjects of a peculiar nature, that cannot be brought under any of the foregoing executions. And even with reſpect to common ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſeveral peculiar circumſtances were diſcovered to which the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions mentioned are not applicable. A court of common law, which cannot in any article exceed the bounds of common law, has not power to ſupply any of theſe defects. This power is reſerved to a court of equity acting upon a principle of juſtice often above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That where-ever there is a right it ought to be made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
                     <p>This ſection comprehends many articles. 1ſt, Subjects that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attached by the executions of common law. 2d, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances where even common ſubjects are withdrawn from theſe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.

                        <p>THE common law is defective with reſpect to a variety of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that cannot be attached by any of its executions; a reverſion, for example, a bond ſecluding executors, a ſum of money with which a diſpoſition of land is burdened, &amp;c. Theſe are all carried by an adjudication invented by the ſovereign court. They could not be carried by an appriſing in the form of common law: nor can they be carried by an adjudication put in place of an appriſing by the act 1672, which by the act itſelf is confined to land, and to what rights are properly acceſſory to land, real ſervitudes, for example, and ſuch like. But this is not all. There are many other rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, to attach which no execution is provided. A debtor has, for example, a well-founded claim for voiding a deed granted by him in his minority greatly to his hurt and leſion: but he is bankrupt, and perverſely declines a proceſs, becauſe the benefit muſt accrue to his creditors: he will neither convey his privilege to them, nor inſiſt on it himſelf. A reductíon on the head of deathbed is an example of the ſame kind. There are many others. If a man fail to purge an irritancy, the common law permits not his creditors to purge in his name; and they cannot in their own, unleſs the privilege be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to them. A court of equity ſteps in to ſupply theſe defects of common law; and, without neceſſity either of a voluntary or judicial conveyance, intitles creditors at ſhort-hand to avail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſuch privileges. They are impowered to proſecute the ſame for their own advantage, in the ſame manner as if the debtor had done them juſtice by making a conveyance in their favour.</p>

Second, A is creditor to B, and B to C. The debt due by C to B is transferred to A by a decree of forthcoming upon an arreſtment laid in the hands of C. But what if before A proceed to execution C die, and no perſon is found who will repreſent him? In this caſe there is no place for an arreſtment; and yet A ought not to be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of his payment. The court of ſeſſion muſt ſupply the defect, by adjudging to A the debt due by C to B.</p>
                        <p>Third, Execution for payment of debt proceeding upon authority of the judge, doing for the debtor what he himſelf ought to have done, ſuppoſes always a <hi>mora</hi> on the debtor's part: and a judge therefore cannot warrantably authoriſe ſuch execution where there is no <hi>mora.</hi> This holds even in a proceſs for payment. Nor is there any foundation in equity, more than at common law, for a proceſs before the term of payment. Where the debtor is ready to fulfil his engagement at the term covenanted, and is guilty of no failure, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice will not ſuffer him to be vexed with a proceſs. But with reſpect to an annuity, or any ſum payable at different terms, if the debtor be once <hi>in mora</hi> to make a proceſs neceſſary for payment of a part actually due, a decree may not only be pronounced for payment of that part, but alſo for what will afterward become due, ſuperſeding execution till the debtor be <hi>in mora.</hi> Equity ſupports this extenſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, which is beneficial to the creditor, by eaſing him of trouble, and not leſs ſo to the debtor, by preventing the coſts that he would otherwiſe be ſubjected to in caſe of future <hi>mora.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From theſe principles it appears, that a proceſs for poinding the ground before the term of payment, ought not to be ſuſtained, more than a proceſs againſt the debtor perſonally for payment. I obſerve indeed, that a proceſs of mails and duties has been ſuſtained after the legal term of Martinmas, though Candlemas be the cuſtomary term of payment <note n="*" place="bottom">Durie, February 5. 1624, Wood contra Waddel.</note>. But the reaſon of this ſingularity is, that originally Martinmas was the conventional term of corn-rent, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was eſtabliſhed to be the legal term. It crept in by practice to delay payment till Candlemas, in order to give the tenant time to threſh out his corns. And for ſome centuries this delay was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an indulgence only, not a matter of right. But, now that long cuſtom has become law, and that a tenant is underſtood not to be bound to pay his corn-rent before Candlemas, a court, whether of common law or of equity, will not readily ſuſtain the proceſs before Candlemas.</p>

                           <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0743600300:227"/>
A proceſs of forthcoming is in a different condition; for being held neceſſary to complete the right of the arreſter, it may in that view proceed before the term of payment of the debt arreſted <note n="*" place="bottom">Durie, Feb. 21. 1624, Brown contra Johnſton. Durie, July 3. 1628, Scot contra Laird of Drumlanrig.</note>. The ſame holds in a proceſs for poinding the ground, where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes neceſſary to complete a baſe infeftment by making it public <note n="†" place="bottom">Gilmour, February 1662, Douglas contra Tenants of Kinglaſſie.</note>.</p>
                        <p>There is one general exception to the foregoing rule, That if a debtor be <hi>vergens ad inopiam,</hi> execution may in equity proceed againſt him for ſecurity. Thus arreſtment in ſecurity was ſuſtained where the debtor was in declining circumſtances <note n="‡" place="bottom">Stair, July 17. 1678, Laird Pitmedden contra Paterſons. Home, Feb. 27. 1758, Meres contra York-building company.</note>. The defendant's teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor gave the plantiff L. 1000, to be paid at the age of twenty-one years. The bill ſuggeſted, that the defendant waſted the eſtate; and pray'd he might give ſecurity to pay this legacy when due; which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed accordingly <note n="‖" place="bottom">1. Chancery caſes 121.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, In the common law of England there is one defect that gives acceſs to the moſt glaring injuſtice. When a man dies, his real eſtate is withdrawn from his perſonal creditors, and his perſonal eſtate from his real creditors. The common law affords not to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal creditor execution againſt the land of his deceaſed debtor, nor to a real creditor execution againſt the moveables; and by this means a man may die in opulent circumſtances, and yet many of his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors be forfeited. Whether the court of chancery interpoſes in this caſe, I am uncertain. In the following caſe it cannot, I am certain, fail to interpoſe; and that is where a debtor, having a near proſpect of death, beſtows all his money on land, in order to diſappoint his perſonal creditors. The common law affords not a remedy, becauſe the purchaſing land is a lawful act; and the common law looks not beyond the act itſelf. But the court of chancery is not ſo circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. If the guilt appear from circumſtances, the court will relieve againſt the wrong, by decreeing ſatisfaction to the perſonal creditors out of the real eſtate.</p>
                        <p>Fifth, The common law reacheth no man but while he continues within the bounds of its juriſdiction. If a debtor therefore be in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts, a judgement cannot paſs againſt him, becauſe he cannot be cited to appear in court; and execution cannot be iſſued againſt his effects without a judgement. This defect, which interrupts the courſe of juſtice, is in Scotland remedied by a citation at the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0743600300:228"/>
of Edinburgh, pier and ſhore of Leith, introduced by the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign court, acting upon the foregoing principle, That where-ever there is a right, it ought to be made effectual. In England, a perſon abroad cannot be cited to appear even in the court of chancery. This court however affords a remedy. It will not warrant a citation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any perſon who is not within the juriſdiction of the court: but it will appoint notice to be given to the debtor; and if he appear not in his own defence, the court will out of his effects decree ſatisfaction to the creditor. Thus, upon an affidavit that the defendant was gone into Holland to avoid the plaintiff's demand againſt him, and he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been arreſted on an attachment, and a <hi>Cepi corpus</hi> returned by the ſheriff, the court of chancery granted a ſequeſtration of the real and perſonal eſtate <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Vernon 344.</note>. By virtue of the ſame power ſupplying the defects of common law, the court of ſeſſion gives authority to attach moveables in this country belonging to a foreigner, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them into money for payment of the creditor who applies for the attachment. Where a debtor, lurking ſomewhere in Scotland, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcovered, the court of ſeſſion makes no difficulty to order him to be cited at that head borough with which he appears to have the greateſt connection.</p>

To remedy this imperfection, adjudications in implement, declarato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry adjudications, &amp;c. were in Scotland invented by the ſovereign court. The following caſe ſhews the neceſſity of a declaratory adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>Sir Robert Munro, debtor to Andrew Drummond banker, aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to John Gordon, <q rend="inline">"in truſt, and for the uſe of the ſaid Andrew Drummond,"</q> certain ſubjects, and in particular an adjudication led by him againſt Mackenzie of Redcaſtle's eſtate. After Gordon's death, Andrew Drummond, upon this adjudication, as his title, brought a proceſs of mails and duties againſt the tenants of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle. And the objection was, That the purſuer having no convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from Gordon, has no title to carry on this proceſs. The judges agreed upon the following propoſitions: 1ſt, That the truſt being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to John Gordon only, and not to his heirs, was at an end by his death; for there cannot be a truſt without a truſtee. 2d, That Sir Robert Munro being diveſted by the truſt-deed, the adjudication returns not to him by the death of the truſtee. 3d, That though the perſon for whom the truſt is created may in his own name inſiſt in every perſonal action flowing from the truſt, yet none but the truſtee can inſiſt in any real action founded on the adjudication; becauſe the truſtee only is veſted in it. Theſe points being ſettled, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was, to find out a legal method for eſtabliſhing the adjudication in the perſon of Andrew Drummond; and the judges came all into the following opinion, That Andrew Drummond's only method was, to raiſe a declaratory adjudication, calling all parties that may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the repreſentatives of John Gordon and of Sir Robert, and concluding that the adjudication thus left <hi>in medio</hi> ſhould be adjudged to him, in order to make effectual the purpoſes of the truſt. This can be done by the court of ſeſſion ſupplying defects in common law. An action was competent to Andrew Drummond againſt John Gordon himſelf, to denude of the adjudication; and the declaratory adjudication comes in place of that action <note n="*" place="bottom">Andrew Drummond contra Mackenzie of Redcaſtle, June 30. 1758.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The common law is defective with reſpect to thoſe who are <hi>in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatione fugae</hi> in order to avoid payment of their debts; but a court

                     <head>SECT. II. Where the common law with reſpect to execution is oppreſſive or unjuſt.</head>
                     <p>EXecution for payment of debt is the operation of the judge or magiſtrate, interpoſing in behalf of a creditor to whom the debtor refuſes or neglects to do juſtice. It is the duty of a debtor to convert his effects into money in order to pay his debts; and if he prove re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory or be negligent, it is the duty of the judge to interpoſe, and in his ſtead to do what he himſelf ought to have done <note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 12. at the beginning.</note>. Hence it clearly appears, that the judge ought not to authoriſe execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any ſubject which the debtor himſelf is not bound to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his creditors, nor to ſell for their behoof. But a court of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, confined by general rules, regards no circumſtance but one ſingly, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the ſubject belong to the debtor: if it be his property, execution iſſues; and it is not conſidered whether the debtor can juſtly apply this ſubject for payment of his debts. This in ſome caſes may prove rigorous and unjuſt. A man who by fraud or other illegal means has acquired the property of a ſubject, is not bound to convey that ſubject to his creditors: on the contrary, he is in conſcience bound to reſtore it to the perſon injured, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the wrong he has done. And in ſuch a caſe, the law ought not to interpoſe in behalf of the creditors, but in behalf of the perſon injured. A court of equity accordingly, correcting the injuſtice of common law, will refuſe its aid to the creditors; who ought not to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0743600300:231"/>
demand from their debtor what in conſcience he ought to reſtore to another; and will give its aid to that other for recovering a ſubject of which he was unjuſtly deprived.</p>
                     <p>Having thus given a general view of the ſubject, I proceed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; and ſhall firſt ſtate a caſe, where a merchant, in immediate proſpect of bankruptcy, purchaſes goods and takes delivery, without any view of paying the price. This is a groſs cheat in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, which binds him in common juſtice to reſtore the goods. A court of common law however, regardleſs of that circumſtance, will authoriſe the bankrupt's creditors to attach theſe goods for their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being his property. This act of injuſtice ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed by a court of equity: if the goods be claimed by the vender, the court of equity, barring execution by the creditors, will decree the goods to be reſtored to him. Thus, a reduction upon the head of the fraud mentioned, was ſuſtained againſt the bankrupt's credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors arreſting the ſubject purchaſed in the hands of the perſon to whom it was delivered for behoof of the purchaſer <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, Fountainhall, December 22. 1680, Prince contra Callat. Dalrymple, Bruce, January 18. 1715, Main contra Maxwell. December 8. 1736, Sir John Inglis contra Royal Bank.</note>. Mrs Rolland obtained a <hi>ceſſio bonorum</hi> anno 1748, and began again to trade as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. In the year 1749 ſhe purchaſed a cargo of wine from Main and company in Liſbon. She commiſſioned another cargo from them May 1750, which was arreſted at Leith by one of her creditors againſt whom ſhe had obtained the <hi>ceſſio bonorum.</hi> The venders ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the forthcoming, and were preferred to the cargo for payment of the price, upon the following medium, That it was fraudulent in Mrs Rolland to commiſſion goods from her foreign cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents, when ſhe muſt have been conſcious that they would not have truſted her had they been informed of the <hi>ceſſio</hi> 
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">Andrew Forbes contra Main and company, February 25. 1752.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The ſame muſt hold with reſpect to land, when purchaſed fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently: when a creditor commences his adjudication, the vender will be admitted for his intereſt, and his objection will be ſuſtained in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, That the land ought not to be adjudged to the creditor, but to him the vender, in order to repair the wrong done him. I put another caſe. In a proceſs of adjudication, a man who had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the land by a minute of ſale before the adjudication was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, appears for his intereſt: ought he not to be preferred? His objection againſt the adjudger appears good in two reſpects: it would, in the firſt place, be unjuſt in the proprietor to grant to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0743600300:232"/>
his creditor a ſecurity upon that ſubject; and it is therefore unjuſt in the creditor to demand the ſecurity by legal execution: in the next place, it would be unjuſt in the court to authoriſe execution againſt a ſubject which the debtor is not bound to ſurrender to his creditors, but, on the contrary, is ſtrictly bound to convey it in terms of the minute of ſale.</p>
                     <p>I illuſtrate this doctrine by applying it to a ſubject of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance that has been frequently canvaſſed in the court of ſeſſion. A factor having ſold his conſtituent's goods, took the obligation for the price in his own name, without mentioning his conſtituent. The factor having died bankrupt, the queſtion aroſe, Whether the ſum in this obligation was to be deemed part of his moveable eſtate affectable by his creditors; or whether he was to be deemed a nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creditor only, and a truſtee for his conſtituent. The common law, regarding the words only, conſiders the obligation as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deceaſed factor: but equity takes under conſideration the circumſtances of the caſe, which prove that the obligation was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be taken <hi>factorio nomine,</hi> or ought to have been ſo intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that the factor's creditors are in equity barred from attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſubject which he was bound to convey to his conſtituent. The conſtituent was accordingly preferred <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, June 9. 1669, Street contra Home. The like, Forbes, March 15. 1707, Hay contra Hay.</note>.

Hugh Murray, named executor in Sir James Rochead's teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appointed a factor to act for him. At clearing accounts there was a balance of L. 268 Sterling in the hands of the factor, for which he granted bill to Murray his conſtituent, and of the ſame date obtained from him a diſcharge of the factory. Murray the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor having died inſolvent, the ſaid bill as belonging to him was confirmed by his creditors. Sir James's next of kin claimed the ſum in the bill as part of his executry, or as the produce of it. They urged, That though the bill was taken payable to Murray ſingly, yet the circumſtances of the caſe evince, that it was taken payable to him in quality of executor, and that he was bound to account for it to Sir James's next of kin. They accordingly were preferred <note n="‡" place="bottom">January 4. 1744, Sir John Baird contra creditors of Murray.</note>. For the ſame reaſon, if an executor, inſtead of receiving payment, take
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0743600300:233"/>
a new bond from a debtor of the deceaſed with a cautioner, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the original bond, this new bond, being a <hi>ſurrogatum</hi> in place of the former, will be conſidered in equity as part of the effects of the deceaſed; and will not be affectable by the creditors of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, book 3. tit. 8. § 71.</note>.

Her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors having arreſted theſe goods, Boylſtoun appeared for his intereſt. The vender depoſed, that he underſtood Makelwood to be the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer for her own behoof. She depoſed upon the commiſſion from Boylſtoun, and that with his money ſhe bought the cloth for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof. The court, in reſpect that the goods being ſold to Makel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood for her own behoof became her property, therefore preferred her creditors the arreſters <note n="‡" place="bottom">Stair, January 24. 1672, Boylſtoun contra Robertſon.</note>. This was acting as a court of common law. The property no doubt veſted in Makelwood, becauſe the goods were ſold and delivered to her for her own behoof: but that circumſtance is far from being deciſive in point of equity. The court ought to have conſidered, that though the transference of property be ruled by the will of the vender, yet that it depends on the will of the purchaſer whether to accept delivery for his own behoof or for behoof of another. Here it clearly appeared that Makelwood bought the goods for behoof of Boylſtoun, and that, in effect, ſhe was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtee only in the ſubject: the legal right was indeed in her, but the equitable right clearly in Boylſtoun. The court ought to have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered further, that Makelwood having laid out Boylſtoun's money in purchaſing the cloth, was bound in juſtice to deliver it to Boylſtoun; and therefore that he in equity ought to have been preferred to her creditors, even though ſhe had been guilty of making the purchaſe for her own behoof.</p>
                     <p>Such is the relief that by a court of equity is afforded to the perſon who has the equitable claim, while matters are entire and the ſubject <hi>in medio.</hi> But now, ſuppoſing the execution to be completed, and the property to be transferred to the creditor ignorant of any claim againſt his debtor, as for example, by a poinding, or by an adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with a decree declaring the legal to be expired, what ſhall be the operation of equity in this caſe? In anſwer to this queſtion, it will hold in general, without a ſingle exception, That a <hi>bona ſide</hi>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0743600300:234"/>
purchaſer lies not open to a challenge in equity more than at common law; becauſe no man can be deprived of his property except by his conſent or his crime.</p>
                     <p>I proceed to another branch of the ſubject. Execution both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and real for payment of debt is afforded by the law of all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: but execution intended againſt the refractory only; is ſometimes extended beyond the bounds of humanity; and equity is interpoſed againſt rigorous creditors, where it can be done by ſome rule that is applicable to all caſes of the kind. Two rules have been diſcovered, which judges may ſafely apply without hazard of becoming arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The firſt governs thoſe caſes where there is ſuch a peculiar connection between the debtor and creditor, as to make kindneſs or benevolence their reciprocal duty. In ſuch caſes, if the creditor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his execution to extremity, and deprive the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>debtor of bread, he acts in contradiction to his poſitive duty, and a court of equity will interpoſe to prevent the wrong. The rule is, That a competency muſt be left to the debtor to preſerve him from indigence. Thus, in the Roman law, parents have <hi>beneficium competentiae</hi> againſt their children, and a patron againſt his client <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 17. De re judicata.</note>. A man againſt his wife <note n="†" place="bottom">§ 37. Inſtit. de actionibus.</note>. And the ſame obtains in an <hi>actio pro ſocio</hi> 
                        <note n="‡" place="bottom">l. 16. De re judicata.</note>. The rule was applied by the court of ſeſſion to protect a father againſt his children, February 21. 1745, Bontein of Mildovan, where two former deciſions on the other ſide were over-ruled. The common law, in affording execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a debtor, intends not to indulge the rigor of creditors acting in direct contradiction to their duty. But as in making laws it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to foreſee every limitation, the rule muſt be made gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, leaving to a court of equity to make exceptions in ſingular eaſes.</p>
                     <p>The other rule is more general, and ſtill more ſafe in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Perſonal execution was contrived to force the debtor, by the terror and hardſhip of perſonal reſtraint, to diſcover his effects, and to do juſtice to his creditors. But if the <hi>ſqualor carceris,</hi> a ſpecies of torture, cannot draw a confeſſion of concealed effects, the unhappy priſoner muſt be held innocent; and upon that ſuppoſition, perſonal reſtraint is not leſs inconſiſtent with juſtice than with humanity. Hence the foundation of the <hi>Ceſſio bonorum,</hi> by which the debtor, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his innocence is proved by the trial of perſonal reſtraint, recovers his liberty, upon conveying to his creditors all his effects. And in Scotland this action is known as far back as we have any written law.</p>

                     <head>APPENDIX to Chap. VII.</head>
                     <p>WHen a creditor leads an adjudication for a greater ſum than is due, it is held that at common law the adjudication is totally void. The reaſon given is, That an adjudication, being an indiviſible right, cannot ſubſiſt in part and fall in part. At the ſame time it is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that where the <hi>pluris petitio</hi> is occaſioned by an innocent error, without any <hi>mala fides</hi> in the creditor, the adjudication ought to be ſupported as a ſecurity for what is juſtly due, not only in accounting with the debtor, but even in a competition with co-creditors; and that in fact it receives this ſupport from the court of ſeſſion acting as a court of equity. If this be the true foundation of the practice, it belongs to the preſent chapter; being an example of equity correcting the rigor of common law with reſpect to execution.</p>
                     <p>But that this practice cannot be founded on equity, appears to me clear from the following conſiderations. In the firſt place, it is made evident above, that one <hi>certans de damno evitando</hi> may take advantage of an error committed by another, and that equity prohibits not ſuch advantage to be taken, except where poſitive gain is made by it <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 98. &amp; 174.</note>. This rule is applicable to the preſent caſe. A creditor demanding his payment in a competition, is <hi>certans de damno evitando;</hi> and for that reaſon, he, in order to obtain preference, may lawfully avail himſelf of any error committed by a co-creditor; and therefore, to ſupport a void adjudication againſt him, is not agreeable to any rule of equity. In the next place, an adjudication <hi>ex facie</hi> null, as proceeding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out citing the debtor, is not ſupported to any effect whatever either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a competing creditor, or even againſt the debtor himſelf. Nor is there any ſupport given to an adjudication againſt an apparent heir, when it proceeds without a ſpecial charge, or when the lands are not ſpecified in the ſpecial charge. This leads me to reflect upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between intrinſic objections, which render the adjudication void and null, and extrinſic objections, which only tend to reſtrict it. If the <hi>pluris petitio</hi> be an objection of the former ſort, the adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being void totally at common law, cannot be ſupported in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, more than an adjudication that proceeds without calling the debtor: if it be an objection of the latter ſort, there may poſſibly be a foundation at common law for ſupporting the adjudication in part, even againſt a competing creditor, though there be no foundation in equity. The important queſtion then is, To which claſs this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0743600300:236"/>
Intrinſic objections, generally ſpeaking, reſolve into an objection of want of power. A judge, unleſs the debtor be called into court, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not adjudge his land to his creditor; and if he proceed without that ſolemnity, he acts <hi>ultra vires,</hi> and the adjudication is void. The caſe is the ſame, where an adjudication is led againſt an apparent heir, without charging him to enter to the eſtate of his anceſtor. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what muſt be the effect of a <hi>pluris petitio,</hi> an adjudication ſhall be conſidered in two lights; firſt as a judicial ſale, and next as a <hi>pignus praetorium.</hi> If a man voluntarily give off land to his creditor for ſatisfaction of L. 1000, underſtood at the time to be due, though the debt be really but L. 900, the ſale is not void; nor is it even void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The property is fairly transferred to the creditor, of which he cannot be forfeited when he is guilty of no fault; and all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains is, that the <hi>quondam</hi> creditor, now proprietor, be bound to make good the difference. A judicial ſale of land for payment of debt, ſtands preciſely on the ſame footing: it cannot be voided upon account of a <hi>pluris petitio</hi> more than a voluntary ſale. I illuſtrate this doctrine, by comparing an adjudication conſidered as a judicial ſale, with a poinding, which is really a judicial ſale. A man poinds his debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's moveables for payment of L. 100, and the poinding is completed by a transference of theſe moveables to the creditor, for ſatisfaction of the debt. It is afterward diſcovered that L. 90 only was due. Will this void the execution, and reſtore the goods to the debtor? No perſon ever dreamed that an innocent <hi>pluris petitio</hi> can have ſuch effect with reſpect to a poinding. By the original form of this execution, the debtor's goods were expoſed to public auction, and the price was delivered to the creditor in payment <hi>pro tanto:</hi> the purchaſer ſurely could not be affected by any diſpute about the extent of the debt; and the reſult muſt be the ſame where the goods are adjudged to the creditor for want of a purchaſer. With regard to all legal effects he is held the purchaſer; and if it ſhall be found that the execution has proceeded for a greater ſum than was really due, this circumſtance will found a perſonal action to the <hi>quondam</hi> debtor, but by no means a <hi>rei vindicatio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But too much is ſaid upon an adjudication conſidered as a judicial ſale; for during the legal at leaſt, it is undoubtedly not a judicial ſale, but a <hi>pignus praetorium</hi> only; and this I have had occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate above <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 194.</note>. If a man ſhall grant to his creditor real ſecurity for L. 1000, when in reality L. 900 is only due, will this <hi>pluris petitio</hi> void the infeftment? There is not the leaſt pretext for ſuch a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0743600300:237"/>
the ſum ſecured will indeed be reſtricted, but the ſecurity will ſtand firm and unſhaken. It will be evident at firſt glance, that the ſame muſt be the caſe of an adjudication led innocently for a greater ſum than is due: a <hi>pignus praetorium</hi> muſt, with reſpect to the preſent point, be preciſely of the ſame nature with a voluntary pledge.</p>
                     <p>Hence it clearly appears, that the ſuſtaining an adjudication for what is truly due, notwithſtanding a <hi>pluris petitio,</hi> is not an operation of equity, to have place regularly in the preſent treatiſe; but truly an operation of common law, which ſuſtains not a <hi>pluris petitio</hi> to any other effect than to reſtrict the ſum ſecured to what is truly due, without impinging upon the ſecurity. Nor is this a vain diſpute; for beſide reſting the point upon its true foundation, which always tends to inſtruction, it will be found to have conſiderable influence in practice. At preſent, an adjudication, where there is a <hi>pluris petitio,</hi> is never ſupported againſt competing creditors farther than to be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the ſums due in equity, ſtriking off all penalties: and this practice is right, ſuppoſing ſuch adjudication to be null at common law, and to be ſupported by equity only. But if a <hi>pluris petitio</hi> have not the effect at common law to void the adjudication, but only to reſtrict the ſum ſecured, there is no place for ſtriking off the penalties, more than where there is no <hi>pluris petitio.</hi> Equity indeed interpoſes to reſtrict penalties to the damage that the creditor can juſtly claim by delay of payment; but this holds in all adjudications equally, not excepting thoſe that are free of all objections.</p>
                     <p>That it is lawful for one <hi>certans de damno evitando</hi> to take advantage of another's error, is an univerſal law of nature. That it has place in covenants is ſhown in a former chapter: and that it ſhould have place among creditors, is evidently agreeable to the rules of juſtice, which dictates, that if there muſt be a loſs, it ought to reſt upon the creditor who hath been guilty of ſome error, rather than upon the creditor who hath avoided all error. When matters of law are taken in a train, and every caſe is reduced to ſome principle, judges ſeldom err. What occaſions ſo many erroneous judgments, is the being ſway'd by particular circumſtances in every new caſe, without ever thinking of recurring to principles or general rules. By this means we are extremely apt to go aſtray, carrying equity ſometimes too far, and ſometimes not far enough. Take the following remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Among the creditors of the York-building company, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of annuitants for life, infeft for their ſecurity, occupied the firſt place; and next in order came the Duke of Norfolk, infeft for a very
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0743600300:238"/>
large ſum. Theſe annuities were frequently bought and ſold; and the purchaſers, in ſome inſtances, inſtead of demanding a conveyance of the original bonds ſecured by infeftment, returned theſe to the company, and took new perſonal bonds in their place, not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that by this method the real ſecurity was unhinged. Theſe new bonds being objected to by the Duke of Norfolk, as merely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, and incapable to compete with his infeftment, the court pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the following interlocutor: <q rend="inline">"In reſpect that the Engliſh pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers, ignorant of the laws of Scotland, had no intention to paſs from their real ſecurity; and that the Duke of Norfolk, who had ſuffered no prejudice by the error, ought not to take advantage of it; therefore find the ſaid annuitants preferable as if they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken aſſignments to the original bonds, inſtead of delivering them up to the company."</q> This was ſtretching equity beyond all bounds; and in effect judging that a creditor is barred by equity from taking advantage of any error committed by a co-creditor. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a reclaiming petition accordingly the interlocutor was altered, and the Duke of Norfolk preferred <note n="*" place="bottom">Feb. 14. 1752, Duke of Norfolk contra Annuitants of the York-building company.</note>. And this judgement was affirmed in the Houſe of Lords.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. Power of a court of equity to inflict puniſhment, and to mitigate it.</head>
                  <p>IT is an inviolable rule in juſtice as well as in expediency, That no man be allow'd to reap the fruits of his fraud, nor to take benefit by any wrong he has done. If, by the tortious act, another be hurt in his rights or privileges, there is ground for reparation at common law; which ſubject is handled in the beginning of this work: but wrong may be done without impinging upon any right or privilege of another; and ſuch wrongs can only be redreſſed in a court of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by inflicting puniſhment in proportion to the offence. In ſlight offences it is ſatisfied with forfeiting the wrong-doer of his gain: in groſſer offences, it not only forſeits the gain, but ſometimes inſlicts a penalty over and above. I begin with caſes of the firſt kind.</p>
                  <p>A man having two eſtates, ſettles them upon A and B, his two ſons; and A diſcovering accidentally a defect in his father's title to the eſtate
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0743600300:239"/>
ſettled upon B, acquires a preferable title, and claims that eſtate from his brother. This palpable tranſgreſſion, not only of gratitude, but of filial affection, was never committed by any perſon with a quiet mind; and yet, upon the principles of common law, this odious man muſt prevail. But a court of equity will interpoſe, and bar him from taking any benefit from this immoral act, by limiting his claim to the ſum laid out upon the purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>If a gratuitous diſpoſition be granted with a proviſo that the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee ſhall perform a certain fact, his acceptance of the diſpoſition ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects him at common law to performance. But let us ſuppoſe that a man makes a ſettlement of his eſtate, burdening his heir with a lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a certain perſon named; and that afterward, in a ſeparate deed, he appoints that perſon to be tutor to his children. Here the legacy being given without any condition, is due at common law whether the legatee undertake the tutory or not. But every one muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that it is an act of ingratitude in the legatee to decline the truſt repoſed in him, and that he is in conſcience bound either to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the tutory or to ſurrender the legacy. If, therefore, he be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt as to claim the legacy without undertaking the truſt, a court of equity will puniſh him with the loſs of his legacy <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dirleton, 16th June 1675, Thomſon contra Ogilvie.</note>. Many examples of the ſame kind are found in the Roman law. A <hi>libertus</hi> claiming a legacy left him by his patron, will be removed <hi>perſonali objectione,</hi> or <hi>exceptione doli,</hi> in the language of the Roman law, if he have been guilty of ingratitude to his patron; even where the act of ingratitude is otherwiſe laudable, as where after the death of the patron the <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> informed againſt him as a ſmuggler <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 1. De his quae ut indign.</note>. But the connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a maſter and his manumitted ſlave was ſo intimate, as to make a ſtep of this kind be reckoned highly ungrateful. Again, a legatee who conceals a teſtament in order to diſappoint the effect of it, is for his ingratitude to the teſtator removed <hi>perſonali objectione</hi> from claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his legacy <note n="‡" place="bottom">l. 25. C. De legatis.</note>. I ſhall add but one other example: <q rend="inline">"Meminiſſe autem oportebit, eum, qui teſtamentum inofficioſum improbe dixit et non obtinuit, id quod in teſtamento accepit perdere, et id ſiſco vindicari quaſi indigno oblatum. Sed ei demum aufertur quod te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamento datum eſt, qui uſque ad ſententiam judicium, lite impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, perſeveraverit: caeterum, ſi ante ſententiam deſtitit vel deceſſit, non ei aufertur quod datum eſt <note n="‖" place="bottom">l. 8. § 14. De inoſſ. teſt.</note>."</q>

                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0743600300:240"/>
When a man is thus forfeited of a good claim, the queſtion is, What becomes of the ſubject claimed? whether doth it accrue to the fiſk, as <hi>bona vacantia,</hi> or is it left with the perſon againſt whom the claim is laid? Ulpian, in the text laſt cited, gives his opinion for the fiſk; thinking probably that the legacy becomes a ſubject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a proprietor; and that if no perſon can claim, it muſt go to the fiſk. Paulus takes the other ſide: <q rend="inline">"Amittere id quod teſtamento meruit, et eum, placuit, qui tutor datus excuſavit ſe a tutela. Sed hoc legatum, quod tutori denegatur, non ad fiſcum transfertur, ſed filio relinquitur cujus utilitates deſertae ſunt <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 5. § 2. De his quae ut indign.</note>."</q> And this ſeems to be the more ſolid opinion. The legatee is not guilty of any wrong with reſpect to the crown, but only with reſpect to the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and his heir. At the ſame time the legacy cannot be ranked <hi>inter bona vacantia;</hi> for the legatee continues proprietor, and is only bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the uſe of his property by an exception competent to the heir, and to him alone, not againſt the legatee's right, but only to defend himſelf againſt payment. There is an additional reaſon for this defence againſt payment, which is, that the heir ſhould have ſome compenſation as a <hi>ſolatium</hi> for that diſtreſs of mind he muſt feel, when treated ill by thoſe who owed gratitude to his father or anceſtor. In our law accordingly the legacy is allowed to remain with the heir: equity forfeits the wrong-doer, and beſtows the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on the family that is burdened with it.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing both parties equally criminal, Ulpian's opinion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſuppoſition ſeems to be well founded. I give for an example an obligation granted <hi>ob turpem cauſam,</hi> paid and diſcharged. Here both parties are equally guilty; and hence the maxim in the Roman law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Quod in turpi cauſa potior eſt conditio poſſidentis;</hi> meaning that the obligee is barred <hi>perſonali objectione</hi> from demanding payment; and that if payment be made, the <hi>quondam</hi> obligor is equally barred from claiming reſtitution. This maxim may hold between the parties; but not againſt the fiſk.</p>
                  <p>Stellionate, which conſiſts in aliening to different perſons the ſame ſubject, is a crime puniſhable by ſtatute <note n="†" place="bottom">Act 105. parl. 1540.</note>. I ſell my land to A by a minute of ſale. I ſell it a ſecond time to B, who is firſt infeſt. If B was ignorant of my bargain with A, his purchaſe will ſtand good in equity as well as at common law; becauſe he made a lawful purchaſe, and had no intention to hurt A. But ſuppoſing B, when he made his purchaſe, to have been in the knowledge of my bargain
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0743600300:241"/>
with A, the queſtion is, What ſhall be the effect of this circumſtance? It can have no effect at common law, which only conſiders that B is preferable by his firſt infeftment, and that A is not more hurt than if his bargain had been unknown to B. But it was a tortious act in B to receive from me what I could not lawfully give him; and he is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for this tortious act by voiding his purchaſe. Thus, if A, having notice that lands were contracted to be ſold to B, purchaſe theſe lands, ſuch purchaſe will be voided in equity <note n="*" place="bottom">Abridg. caſes in equity, chap. 42. ſect. A. § 1.</note>. Again, in a caſe of two purchaſers of the ſame land in Yorkſhire, where the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond purchaſer, having notice of the firſt purchaſe, and that it was not regiſtered, went on and purchaſed, and got his purchaſe regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, it was decreed, that the firſt purchaſer was preferable <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. chap. 47. ſect. B. § 12.</note>. A, who purchaſed land though he knew that the vender was but tenant for life, and that the property was in his ſon, ſold the land afterward to B, who had no notice of the ſettlement. Upon a bill brought by the ſon after the death of his father againſt A and B, it was decreed, That as to B, who was purchaſer without notice, the bill ſhould be diſmiſſed; but that A ſhould account for the purchaſe-money he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, with intereſt from the death of the tenant for<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. chap. 42. ſect. A. § 5.</note> life <note n="a" place="bottom">From this and other ſimilar caſes contained in the chancery-reports, one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be a rule eſtabliſhed in England, that a <hi>bona fide</hi> purchaſer, even from a perſon who has no right, is ſecure in equity. But if ſuch purchaſer be ſecure, it cannot be upon any principle in equity: for equity forfeits no man of his property unleſs he be guilty of ſome wrong; and though a <hi>bona fide</hi> purchaſe be an equitable title, the title of the true proprietor claiming his ſubject is not leſs ſo. If a <hi>bona fide</hi> purchaſer from a perſon who has no right be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the former proprietor, this preference can have no other foundation than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law. That ſuch was once the common law is certain, <hi>Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract</hi> 3.; and, from the decrees above mentioned, it would appear, that the law of England continues the ſame to this day.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Next where a man purchaſes a ſubject which he knows to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached by inchoated execution. The diſponing a ſubject thus legally attached is not ſtellionate, becauſe it comes not under the definition of granting double rights. But the diſponer is guilty of a moral wrong, in attempting to diſappoint his creditor, by withdrawing the ſubject from his execution, to which wrong the purchaſer is acceſſory if he had notice of the execution; and for that reaſon, though the purchaſer's title be firſt completed, he will be poſtponed to the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in a court of equity, as a puniſhment upon him. Thus the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teur of a bill of exchange, having indorſed the ſame for ready money after it was attached by an arreſtment laid in the hands of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0743600300:242"/>
the arreſter was preferred to the onerous indorſee, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon above mentioned, that the latter when he took the indorſation was in the knowledge of the arreſtment <note n="*" place="bottom">June 1728, Competition between Logan and M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Caul.</note>. This opens the foundation of a propoſition eſtabliſhed in practice, That inchoated execution renders the ſubject litigious. After an adjudication, for example, is commenced, it is wrong in the debtor to ſell the land; and it is wrong for any one to purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>We proceed to the caſe of a creditor, who, for his ſecurity, takes a conveyance to a ſubject which he knows was formerly diſponed to another for a valuable conſideration. What pleads for this creditor's preference, is the neceſſity of providing for his ſecurity when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe obtain payment. But the debtor is undoubtedly crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in granting the ſecurity: he is guilty of ſtellionate, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor is acceſſory to the crime. This circumſtance ought to bar him in equity from taking the benefit of his real ſecurity againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſponee; for I hold it to be clear in principles, that the motive of preventing loſs is in no caſe a ſufficient excuſe for doing an unjuſt act, or for being acceſſory to it.</p>
                  <p>Such is the relief that by equity is afforded in favour of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table claim againſt a purchaſe made <hi>mala fide.</hi> Let us now ſuppoſe that a purchaſe is fairly made without notice, and that the property is transferred to the purchaſer. I put a ſtrong caſe, that a man is guilty of ſtellionate, by ſelling his land a ſecond time, and that the ſecond purchaſer, ignorant of the other, obtains the firſt infeftment. To make the queſtion of importance, let it alſo be ſuppoſed, that the price is paid by the firſt purchaſer, and that the common author is now bankrupt. Some circumſtances at firſt view ſeem to weigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond purchaſer: The common author is guilty of ſtellio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and though the ſecond purchaſer is not acceſſory to the crime, he takes however the benefit of an iniquitous deed; which may be reckoned not altogether fair. But upon mature reflection it will be found, that juſtice militates not againſt him. By obtaining the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment he becomes proprietor: and it only remains to be conſidered, whether there by any ground in equity or juſtice to forfeit him of his property. Such forfeiture cannot otherwiſe be juſt than as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a crime, and therefore it cannot be applied againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Hence an inviolable rule of juſtice, That the innocent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deprived of their property unleſs by their own conſent. By this rule, the ſecond purchaſer firſt infeft is ſecure: he is ſecure by the common law, becauſe he has the firſt infeftment; and he is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0743600300:243"/>
ſecure by equity, becauſe, having purchaſed <hi>bona fide,</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
                  <p>A is tenant in tail, remainder to his brother B in tail. A not knowing of the entail, makes a ſettlement on his wife for life as a jointure, without levying a fine, or ſuffering a recovery. B, who knew of the entail, ingroſſes this ſettlement, but does not mention any thing of the entail; becauſe, as he confeſſed in his anſwer, if he had ſpoke of it, his brother, by a recovery, might have cut off the remainder, and barred him. B, after the brother's death, recovered an ejectment againſt the widow by force of the entail. She was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in chancery; and a perpetual injunction granted for this wrong done by B in concealing the entail; for if the entail had been diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the ſettlement would have been made good by a recovery <note n="*" place="bottom">Preced. chan. 35. Raw contra Potts.</note>. The connection which B had with the parties, partly by blood, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by being employed to ingroſs the ſettlement, made it his duty to inform his brother of the entail. And his wilful tranſgreſſion of this duty was a moral wrong, which juſtly deprived him of the benefit he projected to himſelf by concealing the entail.</p>
                  <p>In a caſe that has ſome analogy to the foregoing, the court of ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as a court of equity, ſtretched their powers a great way further; further, I am perſuaded, than can be juſtified. An heireſs's infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a ſervice to her predeceſſor, being, after her death, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged in a reduction as null and void, with the view to diſappoint her huſband of his curteſy; the court decreed, That the heireſs's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment not having been challenged till after her death, it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupport the curteſy, upon the following ground of equity, That had it been challenged during her life, the nullity might and would have been ſupplied <note n="†" place="bottom">June 1716, Hamilton contra Boſwell.</note>. One is prone to approve this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and yet there appear unſurmountable difficulties.

                  <p>A man, contrary to conſcience, is not ſuffered to make a defence more than to make a claim. A defendant, ſued for his rent, depoſed that he had no leaſe: being afterward ſued to remove, he produced a current leaſe. He was barred <hi>perſonali objectione</hi> from founding any

It is not clear in this caſe what was the <hi>ratio decidendi;</hi> whether a penalty was intended for falſifying the bond, or whether the court meant only to refuſe action upon a bond that was vitiated; which they might well do, becauſe the word <hi>pounds</hi> was an evident vitiation, by being ſuperinduced over another word that could not be known to be <hi>merks</hi> but by conjecture. The trying caſe would have been a reference to the defender's oath, that he really borrowed the ſum originally contained in the bond.

Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account the act 13 Edward I. cap. 34. was made, enacting, <q rend="inline">"That if a wife willingly leave her huſband, and continue with her adulterer, ſhe ſhall be barred for ever of her dower, unleſs her huſband willingly, and without coertion of the church, be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to her."</q> Eliſabeth Clement, after living with her huſband for three months, deſerted him, and lived in open adultery with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man, by whom ſhe had a child. Being cited before the kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Crieff, ſhe confeſſed her guilt, and ſuffered public penance in preſence of the congregation. After her huſband's deceaſe ſhe claimed from his repreſentatives the third part of his moveables, and the terce of his land. Her claim was ſuſtained, notwithſtanding her adultery, which was not denied. What moved the plurality of the judges was, that ſince there was no divorce, the purſuer's adultery did not deprive her of her quality of relict, nor conſequently of her legal proviſions. This may be right at common law; but it ought to have been conſidered, that a woman who hath behaved ſo unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as a wife, is juſtly deprived of the privileges of a wife; and that ſhe ought not to have the aid of a court of equity to make theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges effectual. The Engliſh ſtatute reſts obviouſly upon this equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table foundation; and now that the principles of equity are ripened, the ſame ought to obtain with us without a ſtatute <note n="†" place="bottom">Eliſabeth Clement contra Sinclair, 4th March 1762.</note>.</p>
                  <p>A penalty cannot be extended beyond the words; but it may be limited within the words upon circumſtances that infer innocence. Captain Forbes, who had not a fur of land in the ſhire of Cromarty, was however by act of parliament appointed commiſſioner of ſupply for that ſhire, under the name and deſignation of <q rend="inline">"Captain John Forbes of New, factor upon the annexed eſtate of Cromarty."</q> A complaint being exhibited againſt him for acting as commiſſioner of ſupply without having the qualification of L. 100 valued rent, the court judged that he had no title to act. But in reſpect he had acted many years without challenge <hi>qua</hi> factor upon the ſaid eſtate, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer factors had done, and in reſpect the objection againſt him was
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0743600300:246"/>
not clear, and in a ſimilar caſe had been found by the court to be no objection, his <hi>bona fides</hi> was ſuſtained to free him from the penalty. And yet upon a reclaiming petition this interlocutor was altered, and he was found liable for the penalty. The judges continued in their former opinion, that he acted <hi>bona fide;</hi> but the plurality thought that they had no power to mitigate the ſtatutory penalty; which was in effect maintaining a very abſurd propoſition, That a puniſhment may be inflicted on an innocent perſon for an error in judgement merely.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of <hi>bona fides</hi> will only hold in ſtatutory penalties; for in a crime againſt the law of nature <hi>bona fides</hi> will never be ſuppoſed. And with reſpect to ſtatutory penalties, many of them are enacted in terms ſo ambiguous, as to make it extremely doubtful in what caſes the penalty is incurred. A man happens to miſtake the ſtatute; or rather happens to judge differently from what is afterward found to be the meaning in a court of law: is it conſiſtent with the rules of morality, or of common juſtice, to ſubject this innocent perſon to the penalty?</p>

               <head>PART II. Powers of a court of equity to remedy the imperfection of common law with reſpect to matters of juſtice that are not pecuniary.</head>
               <p>THE goods of fortune, ſuch as admit an eſtimation in money, are the great ſource of controverſy and debate among private perſons. And, for that reaſon, when civil courts were inſtituted, it was not thought neceſſary to extend their juriſdiction beyond pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matters: the improvement was indeed ſo great as to be held alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether complete. But time unfolded many intereſting articles that are not pecuniary. Some of them, making a figure, are diſtributed among certain courts: a claim of peerage, for example, is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the Houſe of Lords; of bearing arms, in the Lyon court; and of being put upon the roll of freeholders, in the court of Barons. Even after this diſtribution, there remain many rights eſtabliſhed by law, and wrongs committed againſt law, that are not pecuniary; which being left unappropriated, muſt be determined in a court of equity: for the great principles ſo often above mentioned, That where there is a right it ought to be made effectual, and where there is a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0743600300:247"/>
wrong it ought to be repreſſed, are equally applicable, whether the intereſt be pecuniary or not pecuniary.</p>
               <p>To collect all the rights eſtabliſhed and wrongs committed that are not pecuniary, would be an endleſs labour: it would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as well as endleſs; for the remedy is not at all intricate. The only queſtion of difficulty is, In what courts ſuch matters are to be tried; and to this queſtion no general anſwer can be given, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that the chancery in England and ſeſſion in Scotland are the proper courts, where there is no peculiar court eſtabliſhed for determining the point in controverſy. I ſhall therefore bring this ſubject within a narrow compaſs, by giving a few examples, which, for the reaſon now mentioned, muſt be determined in the court of ſeſſion.</p>
               <p>The qualifications of a man claiming to be a freeholder, muſt be judged by the freeholders of the county, convened at their Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas head-court: but the law has provided no remedy for a wrong that may be committed by the freeholders, <hi>viz.</hi> their forbearing to meet at the Michaelmas head-court, in order to prevent a man from applying to be put upon the roll; and therefore it is incumbent upon the court of ſeſſion to redreſs this wrong, by ordering the freeholders to meet under a penalty.</p>
               <p>The next caſe I ſhall mention is of great importance, becauſe it comprehends an extenſive field of law. It is, Whether and in what caſes a covenant or promiſe for behoof of a perſon who is abſent, can be effectual, either to the contractor who exacts the obligation, or to the abſent party. I am aware that the intereſt which ariſes to the abſent from ſuch a promiſe or covenant, being generally pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary, ought in ſtrict form to have been handled above. But the intereſt of the perſon who exacts the obligation for behoof of the abſent, is not pecuniary; and the connection of theſe different inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, ariſing both from the ſame promiſe or covenant, makes it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they ſhould be handled together.</p>
               <p>In treating of this nice ſubject, I cannot hope to give ſatisfaction to the reader, without firſt explaining, more minutely than has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been neceſſary, the nature of a promiſe and of a covenant; particularly how far they are binding in conſcience, and how far in law. Promiſes and covenants are provided by nature for obliging us to be uſeful to others, beyond the bounds of natural duty. They are perfected by a peculiar act of the will, termed <hi>conſent,</hi> expreſſed exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by words or by apt ſigns. And they are binding by the very
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0743600300:248"/>
conſtitution of our nature, the moral ſenſe dictating that every ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional promiſe ought to be performed.</p>
               <p>No circumſtance ſhows more conſpicuouſly our deſtination for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, than the obligation we are laid under by our very nature to perform our promiſes and covenants. And to make our engagements the more extenſively uſeful in the ſocial ſtate, we find ourſelves bound in conſcience, not only to thoſe with whom we contract, but alſo to others for whoſe benefit the contract is made, however igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the favour intended them. If A exact from me a promiſe to pay L. 100 to B, I ſtand bound in conſcience to perform my promiſe. It is true, that the promiſe being made to A, it is in his power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſame; and therefore, if he be ſilent without requiring me to perform, my obligation is in the mean time ſuſpended, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſult of his will. But as A's death puts an end to his power of relieving me from my obligation, the ſuſpenſion is thereby remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and from that moment it becomes my indiſpenſable duty to pay the L. 100 to B.</p>
               <p>The binding quality of a promiſe goes ſtill farther. If I promiſe A to educate his children after his death, or to build a monument for him, conſcience binds me alſo in this caſe: which is wiſely order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the author of our nature; for a man dies in peace if he can rely upon the promiſes made to him of fulfilling his will after his death. And though my friend die without a ſingle heir to repreſent him, I find myſelf, however, bound in conſcience to execute his will. Here then comes out a ſingular caſe, an obligor without an obligee. And if it be demanded what compulſion I am under to perform, when a court of law cannot interpoſe without an obligee to bring an action; the anſwer is, that I ſtand bound in conſcience, as men were by a covenant before courts of law were inſtituted. Nor is this caſe altogether neglected by law. It is extremely probable, that a court of equity would compel me to execute the will of my deceaſed friend, upon a complaint brought by any of his relations, though they could not ſtate themſelves as obligees.</p>
               <p>Such are the binding qualities of a promiſe, and of a covenant, by the law of our nature. We proceed to ſhow how far theſe qualities are ſupported by municipal law.</p>
               <p>For a long period after courts of law were inſtituted, covenants and promiſes were left upon conſcience, and were not inforc'd by any action. This in particular was the caſe among our Saxon anceſtors: they did not give an action even upon buying and ſelling, though the moſt neceſſary of all covenants. The Romans were more liberal;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0743600300:249"/>
and yet they confined their actions to a few covenants that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in commerce. At the ſame time, the action given to inforce theſe covenants was confined within the narroweſt bounds. In the firſt place, as only pecuniary intereſt was regarded, no action was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon a covenant, unleſs the plaintiff could ſhow that it tended to his pecuniary intereſt <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 38. § 17. De verborum oblig.</note>. And accordingly an action was denied upon a contract to pay a ſum of money to a third perſon. In the next place, though that perſon had a pecuniary intereſt to have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract performed, yet action was not given him; becauſe, in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man law, no action was given upon a contract but to thoſe who were parties to it <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 11. De obligationibus et actionibus.</note>. And hence the famous Roman law maxim, <hi>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur obligatio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by confining the actions upon a covenant within ſo narrow bounds, many moral rights and obligations are left unſupported by municipal law. The Roman law, in particular, is ſignally defective in denying ſupport to any right but what terminates upon pecuniary intereſt. If I exact a promiſe in favour of a ſtranger, action for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is deny'd me, it being held that I am not intereſted to have it performed. Is the caſe the ſame where the promiſe is in favour of a friend, or of a diſtant relation? Perhaps it may. Let us then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the promiſe to be made in favour of my benefactor, or of my child, perhaps my heir. Have not I to whom the promiſe was made, an intereſt to exact performance in this caſe? No perſon of feeling can anſwer with confidence in the negative. Intricate queſtions of this kind lead to a general doctrine founded on human nature, That the accompliſhment of every honeſt purpoſe is a man's intereſt. And accordingly, in the affairs of this world, it is far from being uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to prefer the intereſt of ambition, of glory, of learning, of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to that of money. This doctrine, by refinement of manners, prevails now univerſally. In the caſe ſtated, that I have an equitable intereſt to exact the promiſe in favour of my friend, is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and a court of equity will accordingly afford me an action to compel performance.</p>
               <p>But has my friend an action in caſe I forbear to interpoſe? He has no action at common law, becauſe the promiſe was not made to him; and as little has he an action in equity during my life, for the following reaſon, that it depends on me to whom the promiſe was made, whether it ſhall be performed or not. It is in my power to paſs from or diſcharge the promiſe made to me; and as this power conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0743600300:250"/>
for life, the obligor cannot be bound to pay to my friend, while it remains uncertain whether it may not be my will to diſcharge the obligation <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 3. De ſervis exportandis. l. 1. C. Si mancipium ita fuerit alienat.</note>.</p>
               <p>I illuſtrate this doctrine by the following examples. I give to my ſervant money to be delivered to my friend as a gift, or to my credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor as payment. The money continues mine till delivery; and I have it in my choice to take it back, or to compel delivery. The friend or creditor has no action. He has not a real action, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the money is not transferred to him: he has not a perſonal action, while it continues in my power to recall the money. If deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very be delay'd, he will not naturally think of any remedy other than of making his complaint to me. This reaſoning appears ſo clear and ſatisfactory, that I am forc'd to give up ſome deciſions of the court of ſeſſion, teaching a very different doctrine. In a minute of ſale of land, the purchaſer was taken bound to pay the price to a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of the vender's: action was ſuſtained to this creditor for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him of the price, though the vender interpoſed, pleading, That the purſuer not being a party to the minute of ſale, no right could ariſe to him from it, and therefore that the mandate or order he the vender gave to the purchaſer about payment of the price, might be recalled by him at his pleaſure <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, July 7. 1664, Ogilvie contra Ker. Durie, January 9. 1627, Supplicants contra Nimmo.</note>. But the court afterward deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined more juſtly in the following caſes, founded on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. A proprietor having reſigned his eſtate in favour of his ſecond ſon and his heirs-male, with a power of redemption to his eldeſt ſon, and the heirs-male of his body, did thereafter limit the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that it ſhould not be exerted unleſs with the conſent of certain perſons named, and impowering thoſe perſons to diſcharge the reverſion altogether if they thought proper, which accordingly they did after the father's death. In a declarator at the inſtance of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſon to aſcertain his right to the eſtate, it was objected by the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, That, by the ſettlement, he had a <hi>jus quaeſitum,</hi> which could not be taken from him. The diſcharge was ſuſtained <note n="‡" place="bottom">Fountainhall, January 2. 1706, Dundas contra Dundas.</note>. Sir Donald Baine of Tulloch diſponed his eſtate to his eldeſt ſon John; and took from him bonds of proviſion in name of his younger children. It was found, that theſe bonds never being delivered, it was in Sir Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald's power to diſcharge or cancel them at pleaſure <note n="‖" place="bottom">July 6. 1717, Roſe contra Baine of Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch.</note>. The like was found 2d July 1755, Hill contra Hill.</p>

                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0743600300:251"/>
To return to the caſe figured, of a promiſe exacted by me in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an abſent perſon, my death muſt make a total change, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him an action which he had not during my life. For if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligor, who formerly was bound at my inſtance to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, remain ſtill bound in conſcience, as is made evident above, it follows, that the perſon in whoſe favour the promiſe was made, muſt be intitled to demand performance. This will readily be yielded where the paction is for a valuable conſideration: if A give a ſum to B, for which B promiſes to A that he will build a houſe to C, B cannot both retain the money and refuſe performance. But the ſame muſt follow though the paction be gratuitous; for B is in conſcience bound to perform his promiſe, and if he be bound, C of courſe muſt be intitled to demand performance.</p>
               <p>From theſe premiſes it follows, that the man who thus makes a contract for the benefit of an abſent perſon, may renounce his power of diſcharging the contract; which renunciation delivered, will inſtantly intitle that perſon to demand performance. Such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation may alſo be inferred <hi>rebus et factis.</hi> As for example, where a man diſpones his eſtate to his eldeſt ſon, and takes from him a bond of proviſion to his younger children by name: while the bond is in the father's cuſtody, it continues under his power; but if he deliver the bond to his children, he is underſtood to renounce his power, which will intitle them to demand payment <note n="*" place="bottom">Dirleton, November 20. 1667, Trotters contra Lundy.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the Roman law, a ſtipulation in favour of the contractor's heirs was early made effectual, by ſuſtaining an action to the heir <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 38 § 12. &amp; 14. De verborum oblig.</note>. By the Roman law, a ſon might ſtipulate in favour of his father, and a ſlave in favour of his maſter. In the progreſs of equity this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege was further extended. Where a man ſtipulated in favour of his daughter, an <hi>utilis actio</hi> was given to the daughter, which is an action in equity <note n="‡" place="bottom">l. 45. § 2. De verborum oblig.</note>. Yet a daughter's paction in favour of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not avail the mother <note n="‖" place="bottom">l. 26. § 4. De pactis dotal.</note>.

               <p>The foregoing doctrine unfolds the nature of <hi>fideicommiſſary</hi> ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0743600300:252"/>
among the Romans. Of theſe ſettlements Juſtinian<note n="*" place="bottom">§ 1. Inſtit. de fideicommiſſ hered.</note> gives a hiſtory which I do not comprehend, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance to elude the law, rendering certain perſons incapable of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king benefit by a teſtament; that it being in vain to ſettle upon ſuch a perſon an eſtate by teſtament, another perſon was named heir, to whom it was recommended to ſettle the eſtate as intended; and that Auguſtus Caeſar gave here a civil action to make the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment effectual. But did Auguſtus make effectual a ſettlement execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in defraud of the law? I can hardly be of that opinion. If the law was inexpedient, why not openly reſcind it? Auguſtus was too wiſe a prince to ſet thus a public example of eluding law. Juſtinian, I ſuſpect, did not underſtand the nature of theſe ſettlements. It was a maxim in the Roman law, derived from the nature of property, That a man cannot name an heir to ſucceed to his heir <note n="†" place="bottom">See as to this point, Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 3.</note>. Becauſe this could not be done directly, it was attempted indirectly by a <hi>fideicom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary</hi> ſettlement: I name my heir regularly in my teſtament, and I order him to make a teſtament in favour of the perſon I incline ſhould ſucceed him. Such ſettlements did at firſt depend entirely on the faith of the heir in poſſeſſion, who upon that account was termed <hi>Heres fiduciarius:</hi> the perſon appointed to ſucceed him, termed <hi>Heres fideicommiſſarius,</hi> had not an action at common law to compel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; for the fiduciary heir was not bound to him, but to the teſtator ſolely. But here was a <hi>rei interventus,</hi> a ſubject in the hands of the fiduciary heir, which, by accepting the teſtament, he bound himſelf to ſettle upon the <hi>fideicommiſſary</hi> heir; and he is therefore bound in conſcience to ſettle it accordingly. The <hi>fideicommiſſary</hi> heir alſo has an equitable claim to the ſubject, founded on the will of the teſtator. Theſe things conſidered, it appears to me plain, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar, with reſpect to ſuch ſettlements, did no more but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a defect in common law, by appointing an action to be ſuſtained in equity to the <hi>fideicommiſſary</hi> heir.</p>
               <p>What is juſt now ſaid ſerves to explain the nature of truſts, where a ſubject is veſted in a truſtee for behoof of a third party, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>naſcituri</hi> of a marriage for example. A truſt of this nature, ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to a <hi>fideicommiſſary</hi> ſettlement among the Romans, comes not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cogniſance of a court of common law; becauſe the perſon in whoſe favour the truſt is eſtabliſhed, not being a party to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has not at common law an action to oblige the truſtee to fulfil
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0743600300:253"/>
his engagement: but he hath an action in equity as above mentioned. And hence it is, that in England ſuch truſts muſt be made effectual in the court of chancery.</p>
               <p>Reviewing what is ſaid above, I am in ſome pain about an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that will readily occur againſt it. A legatee, by the common law of the Romans, had an action againſt the heir for performance; and yet a legatee is not made a party in the teſtament; nor is the heir, by accepting the teſtament, bound to him, but to the teſtator ſolely. In order to remove this objection, an account muſt be given of the different kinds of legacies well known in the Roman law; and by putting this ſubject in its true light, the objection will vaniſh. In the firſt place, where a legacy is left of a <hi>corpus,</hi> the property is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the legatee <hi>ipſo facto</hi> upon the teſtator's death, conformable to a general rule in law, That ſubjects are transferred from the dead to the living without neceſſity of delivery: for after the proprietor's death, there is no perſon who can make delivery; and if will alone, in this caſe, have not the effect to transfer property, it never can be transferred from the dead to the living. Upon that account, a legatee of a <hi>corpus</hi> has no occaſion to ſue the heir for delivery: he hath a <hi>rei vindicatio</hi> at common law. The next kind of legacy I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is where a bond for a ſum of money is bequeathed directly to Titius. The ſubject here, as in the former caſe, veſts in the legatee <hi>ipſo facto</hi> upon the teſtator's death. The legatee has no occaſion for an action againſt the heir; for in quality of creditor he has at common law an action againſt the debtor for payment. A third ſort of legacy is, where the teſtator burdens his heir to pay a certain ſum to Titius. This is the only ſort, reſembling a <hi>fideicommiſſary</hi> ſettlement, to which the maxim can be applied <hi>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur obligatio.</hi> But as an action at common law for making other legacies effectual was familiar, the influence of connection, without making nice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, produced an action at common law for this ſort alſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that can be made of this inſtance, is to prove what will appear in many inſtances, that common law and equity are not ſeparated by any accurate boundary.</p>
               <p>Our entails upon the common law are, in ſeveral reſpects, ſimilar to the Roman <hi>ſideicommiſſary</hi> ſettlements; and ſo far are governed by the principles above eſtabliſhed. I give the following inſtances. A man makes an entail in favour of his ſon or other relation, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning the eſtate to him, ſubſtituting a certain ſeries of heirs, and reſerving his own liferent. The inſtitute, though fettered with irritant and reſolutive clauſes, is however veſted in the full property
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0743600300:254"/>
of the eſtate <note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 3. toward the cloſe.</note>; and the ſubſtitutes, for the reaſon above given, have not an action at common law to oblige the inſtitute to make the entail effectual in their favour. But the inſtitute reſembles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely a Roman <hi>heres ſiduciarius,</hi> and is bound in equity to fulfil the will of the entailer, by permitting the ſubſtitutes to ſucceed in their order.</p>
               <p>I give a ſecond inſtance, in order to clear up a celebrated queſtion often diſputed in the court of ſeſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether an entail, ſuch as that above mentioned, after being completed by infeftment, can be altered or diſcharged even by the joint deed of the entailer and inſtitute. Our lawyers have generally leaned to the negative. The inſtitute, they urge, fettered by the entail, has not power to alter or diſcharge; and the will of the entailer, who is not now proprietor, cannot avail. This reaſoning is a mere ſophiſm. The full property is veſted in every tenant in tail, not leſs than in him who inherits a fee-ſimple. A tenant in tail is indeed limited as to the exerciſe of his powers of property: he muſt not alien, and he muſt not alter the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſucceſſion. But theſe, and ſuch like limitations, proceed not from defect of power <hi>qua proprietor,</hi> but from being bound perſonally, by acceptance of the entail, not to exerciſe theſe powers <note n="†" place="bottom">This doctrine is more fully explained in tract 3. above cited.</note>. This diſtinction with reſpect to the preſent queſtion is of moment. A man cannot exerciſe any power beyond the nature of his right: ſuch an act is void; and every perſon is intitled to object to it. But no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, other than the obligee, is intitled to object to the tranſgreſſion of a covenant or perſonal obligation. The entailer, in the caſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is the obligee: it is he who took the inſtitute bound to limit as above the exerciſe of his property; and he therefore has it in his choice, to keep the heir bound, or to releaſe him from his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To be in a condition to grant ſuch releaſe, it is neceſſary indeed that he be obligee, but it is not neceſſary that he be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears, that the ſubſtitutes have no title while the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailer is alive, to reſtrain the inſtitute from the free uſe of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They have no claim perſonally againſt the inſtitute, who ſtands bound to the entailer, not to them: nor have they any other ground for an action, ſeeing the full property of the eſtate is veſted in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, and no part in them. In a word, it depends entirely upon the entailer, during his life, whether the entail ſhall be effectual or
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0743600300:255"/>
not; and while that continues to be his privilege, the ſubſtitutes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently can have no claim. I go farther by aſſerting, that the entailer cannot deprive himſelf of this privilege, even though he ſhould expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce it in the deed of entail. The ſubſtitutes are not made parties to the entail, and the renunciation, though in their favour, is not made to them. The renunciation is at beſt but a gratuitous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which none are intitled to lay hold of but that very perſon to whom it is made.</p>
               <p>A great change indeed is produced by the entailer's death. There now exiſts no longer a perſon who can looſe the fetters of the entail. The inſtitute now muſt for ever be bound by his own deed, reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from the free exerciſe of his property; and as the ſubſtitutes, by the entailer's will, have in their order an equitable claim to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, a court of equity will make this claim effectual.</p>
               <p>But here a queſtion may naturally ariſe, Why ought not the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege which the entailer had to diſcharge the fetters of the entail, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to his heirs? The ſolid and ſatisfactory anſwer is what follows. No right nor privilege deſcends to an heir but what is pecuniary, and tends to make him <hi>locupletior:</hi> but the privilege of diſcharging the fetters of an entail makes not the heir <hi>locupletior,</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends not to him.</p>
               <p>Similar to the rule above explained <hi>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur obligatio,</hi> is the following rule <hi>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi> Theſe rules being governed by the ſame principle, throw light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other; and ought therefore to be handled together. I obtain from a man a promiſe to diſcharge his debtor, the queſtion is, What ſhall be the effect of that promiſe? The Roman lawyers anſwer, that I cannot have an action to compel performance, becauſe I have no intereſt that performance ſhould be made; and that the debtor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have an action to compel performance, becauſe he was not a party to the agreement <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 17. § 4. De pactis.</note>.</p>
               <p>But the Roman writers were certainly guilty of an overſight in not diſtinguiſhing here a <hi>pactum liberatorium</hi> from a <hi>pactum obligatorium.</hi> For admitting the latter to be limited as above by the common law of the Romans, it can be made evident from the principles of that very law, that the former cannot be ſo limited, but that it muſt be effectual to him for whoſe behoof it is made, whether the perſon who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it be connected with him or not. The difference indeed with reſpect to the preſent point between theſe pactions, ariſes not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0743600300:256"/>
difference in their nature, but from the nature of a court of law. Courts of law, as above mentioned, were originally circumſcribed within narrow bounds; and with reſpect to the Roman courts in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, many <hi>pacta obligatoria</hi> were left upon conſcience unſupported by theſe courts. Such a conſtitution, indeed, confines courts within too narrow limits with reſpect to their power of doing good; but then it does not lead them to do any wrong. The caſe is very different with reſpect to <hi>pacta liberatoria:</hi> it is unjuſt in the creditor to demand payment after he has promiſed, even gratuitouſly, to diſcharge the debt; and a court of law would be acceſſory to this act of injuſtice, if it ſuſtained action after ſuch a promiſe. The court therefore muſt refuſe to ſuſtain action; or rather muſt ſuſtain the <hi>pactum liberatorium</hi> as a good exception to the action <note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 2.</note>. And it makes no difference in this caſe, whether the perſon who obtained the promiſe be dead or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. For while the promiſe ſubſiſts, it muſt bar the creditor from claiming payment, and muſt bar every court from ſupporting ſuch claim. It is true, indeed, that while the perſon who obtained the promiſe is alive, it is in his power to diſcharge the promiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to intitle the creditor to an action. But till that diſcharge be obtained, it would be unjuſt in any court to ſuſtain action.</p>
               <p>Some of the Roman writers, ſenſible that an action for payment ought not to be ſuſtained to a creditor who has paſſed from his debt, endeavour to make this opinion conſiſtent with the rule <hi>Quod alii per alium non acquiritur exceptio,</hi> by a ſubtilty that goes out of ſight. They inſiſt, that the debtor cannot found a defence upon a paction to which he was not a party: but they yield, that the paction, though not effectual to the debtro, is effectual againſt the creditor; and they make it effectual againſt him, by ſuſtaining to the debtor an <hi>exceptio doli</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 25. § 2. l. 26. De pactis. l. 26. § 4. De pactis dotalibus.</note>.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſame principle, if a third perſon who is not bound, pay a debt, and take a diſcharge in name of the debtor, the debtor, though the diſcharge be not delivered to him, can defend himſelf by an <hi>exceptio doli</hi> againſt the creditor demanding payment from him. For the creditor who has received payment from the third perſon, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in conſcience demand a ſecond payment from the debtor. But though he be barred from demanding a ſecond payment, it does not follow that the debt is extinguiſhed. That it remains a ſubſiſting debt will appear from conſidering, 1<hi>mo,</hi> That the tranſaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the creditor and the third perſon may be diſſolved as it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0743600300:257"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> by mutual conſent, and by cancelling the diſcharge. 2<hi>do,</hi> The debtor, notwithſtanding the erroneous payment, has it in his power to force a diſcharge from the creditor upon offering him payment: neither of which could happen, were the debt extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
               <p>It only remains to be obſerved upon this head, that, when a debt is thus paid by a third perſon, it is in the debtor's choice to refund the money to the third perſon, or to pay it to the creditor. But if he chuſe to defend himſelf againſt the creditor by an <hi>exceptio doli,</hi> which imports his ratification of the payment, the ſuſtaining this exception hath two effects: 1ſt, It operates to him a legal extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the debt; and, next, It intitles the third perſon to demand the ſum from him.</p>

               <p>JUSTICE is concerned in two things equally capital; one to make right effectual, and one to redreſs wrong. With reſpect to the former, utility coincides with juſtice: with reſpect to the latter, utility goes farther than juſtice. Wrong muſt be done before juſtice can interpoſe; but utility, having a more extenſive view, lays down meaſures that are preventive of wrong. With reſpect to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for the poſitive good of ſociety, and for making men ſtill more happy in a ſocial ſtate, theſe are reſerved to the legiſlature <note n="a" place="bottom">And to interpoſe for advancing the poſitive good of but one or a few individuals, is ſtill farther beyond the powers of a court of equity; though the court of chancery has ſometimes ventured to exert itſelf for this narrow purpoſe, actuated by a laudable zeal to do good, carried indeed beyond proper bounds. I give the following inſtance. Eighteen tenants of a manor have right to a common, and fifteen of them agree to incloſe. The incloſing will be decreed though oppoſed by three: for it ſhall not be in the power of a few wilful perſons to oppoſe a public good; <hi>Abridg. caſes in equity, cap.</hi> 4. <hi>ſect.

               <p>INDIVIDUALS in ſociety are linked together by many different rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that require each of them a ſuitable behaviour or conduct; and that we ſhould act according to the relations in which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, appears not only proper, but, by the moral ſenſe, is made our duty. The relations in particular that imply ſubordination, make the corner-ſtone of government, and ripen men gradually for beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving properly in it. The reciprocal duties that ariſe from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of parent and child, of preceptor and ſcholar, of maſter and ſervant, of the high and low, of the rich and poor, &amp;c. pave the way to others that follow, and inure us to the duties both of rulers and of ſubjects. It is for this reaſon extremely material, that the reciprocal duties ariſing from ſubordination be preſerved from incroaching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other: to reverſe them would reverſe the order of nature, and would tend to the diſſolution of government. To ſuffer, for example, a young man to uſurp upon his father, and to aſſume rule over him, has not only the bad tendency now mentioned, but is directly immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and a breach of duty. A wrong, however, of this nature not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pecuniary, comes not under the juriſdiction of courts of common law, and therefore muſt be repreſſed by a court of equity. It might, as a wrong not pecuniary, have found a place in the foregoing book; but as it makes a greater figure by its poiſonous and undermining conſequences, I choſe it as proper for the front of the preſent book.</p>
               <p>A young man in his contract of marriage having conſented to be put under interdiction to his father and father-in-law, and to the eldeſt ſon of the marriage in caſe of their failure; and the two firſt being dead, the court refuſed to ſuſtain an interdiction where the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to be interdicted, and the ſon interdictor <note n="*" place="bottom">Durie, January 18. 1622, Silvertonhill contra his Father.</note>.

Other deeds tending to or ariſing from depravation of manners, are alſo rejected by a court of equity. Thus a man who had fallen out with his mother, ſettled his manſion-houſe on his brother, and took a bond from him in his ſiſter's name, that he ſhould not permit his mother to come into the houſe. The bond was decreed to be ſet aſide <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Vernon 413.</note>.</p>
               <p>A bond that appears from its narrative to be granted as a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to commit adultery, or any other crime, will be reprobated even at common law. And though the cauſe be not mentioned in the bond itſelf, it will be rejected by a court of equity, if it appear from collateral evidence, that ſuch was the cauſe of granting the bond. But as it is a duty, not a wrong, to provide for a baſtard child, or to provide for a woman that the man has robbed of her chaſtity, a bond or ſettlement made for that purpoſe is effectual both in law and equity <note n="†" place="bottom">Durie, June 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE ſpirit of mutiny ſhewed itſelf ſome time ago among the workmen in the city of London, and roſe to ſuch a height as to require the interpoſition of the legiſlature. The ſame ſpirit broke
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0743600300:261"/>
out afterward among the journeymen-tailors of Edinburgh, who erected themſelves into a club or ſociety, keeping in particular a liſt of the journeymen out of ſervice, under pretext of accommodating the maſters more eaſily with workmen, but in reality to enable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to get new maſters if they differed with thoſe they ſerved. When any of them deſerted their ſervice, they entered their names in that liſt, and were immediately again employed, as other maſters were under a neceſſity to take them or to give up their buſineſs. The maſter-tailors ſuffered many inconveniencies from this combination, which among other hardſhips produced increaſe of wages from time to time. The journeymen, for ſaving time, had always breakfaſted in the houſes of their maſter; but upon a concert among them, they all of them deſerted their work about nine in the morning, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their reſolution to have the hour between nine and ten to themſelves in all time coming. This deſertion was the more diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it was made when the preparing ſome cloathing for the army required the utmoſt diſpatch. This occaſioned a complaint to the Bailies of Edinburgh; who found, <q rend="inline">"That the defenders, and other journeymen-tailors of Edinburgh, are not intitled to an hour of receſs for breakfaſt; that the wages of a journeyman-tailor in the ſaid city ought not to exceed one ſhilling <hi>per</hi> day; and that if any journeyman-tailor, not retained or employed, ſhall refuſe to work when required by a maſter on the foreſaid terms, unleſs for ſome ſufficient cauſe to be allowed by the magiſtrates, the offender ſhall upon conviction be puniſhed in terms of law."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This cauſe being brought to the court of ſeſſion by advocation, it was thought of ſufficient importance for a hearing in preſence; and the reſult was, to approve of the regulations of the magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>The only difficulty was, whether the foreſaid regulations did not incroach upon the liberty of the ſubject. It was admitted that they did in ſome meaſure; but then the court was ſatisfied of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity from the following conſiderations. Arts and manufactures are of two kinds. Thoſe for luxury and for amuſement are ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no rules, becauſe a ſociety may ſubſiſt comfortably without them. But thoſe which are neceſſary to the well-being of ſociety muſt be ſubjected to rules; otherwiſe it may be in the power of a few individuals to do much miſchief. If the bakers ſhould refuſe to make bread, or the brewers to make ale, or the colliers to provide coals, without being ſubjected to any control, they would be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the lives of the inhabitants. To remedy ſuch an evil, which is of the firſt magnitude, there muſt be a power placed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0743600300:262"/>
where; and accordingly this power has been long exerciſed by magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of boroughs and juſtices of peace, under review of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign court. The tailors, by forbearing to work, cannot do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ſo ſuddenly; but people muſt be clad; and if there be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the obſtinacy of the tailors, they may compel people to ſubmit to the moſt exorbitant terms.</p>
               <p>Another point debated was the propriety of the foregoing regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Upon which it was obſerved, that the regulation of the wages is even admitted by the defenders themſelves to be proper, becauſe they have acquieſced in it without complaint. And yet if this article be admitted, the other regulations follow of neceſſary conſequence; for it is to no purpoſe to fix wages without alſo fixing the number of working hours; and it is to no purpoſe to fix either, if the defenders have the privilege to work or not at their pleaſure. Their demand of a receſs between nine and ten, which they chiefly inſiſt for, is extremely inconvenient, becauſe of the time it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, eſpecially in a wet day, when they muſt ſhift and dry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to avoid ſullying the new work they have on hand.

               <p>SOCIETY cannot flouriſh by pecuniary commerce merely: laying aſide benevolence, the ſocial ſtate would neither be commodious nor comfortable. There are ſeveral connections formed chiefly by conſent, that are in their nature and intendment altogether diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; witneſs the connection between a guardian and his infant, and in general between a truſtee and the perſon for whoſe behoof the truſt is gratuitouſly undertaken. In this caſe, to take a premium for executing any article of the truſt, may ſometimes be extortion, of which in the former book; and being in every caſe inconſiſtent with the truſtee's duty, will be diſcountenanced even at common law. Thus a bond for 500 merks granted to an interdictor by one who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed land from the perſon interdicted, was voided <note n="*" place="bottom">Haddington, penult July 1622, Carnouſie contra Achanachie.</note>. If the ſale was a rational meaſure, it was the interdictor's duty to conſent to it without a bribe: if the ſale was hurtful to the perſon interdicted, the interdictor's taking a ſum for his conſent was taking a bribe to betray his truſt.</p>
               <p>But equity goes farther, and prohibits a truſtee from making any profit by his management directly or indirectly. However inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent an act of this nature may be in itſelf, it is poiſonous with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to its conſequences; for if any opportunity be given for making profit in this manner, a truſtee will loſe ſight of his duty, and ſoon learn to direct his management chiefly or ſolely for his own profit. It is ſolely upon this foundation that a tutor is barred from making profit, by purchaſing debts due by his pupil, or rights affecting his eſtate. The ſame hazard of miſchief concludes alſo againſt a truſtee who hath a ſalary, or is paid for his labour. A <hi>pactum de quota litis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an advocate and his client, which tends to corrupt the morals of the former, and to make him ſwerve from his duty, is diſcouraged in all civilized countries. A bargain of this kind may be fair, and even beneficial to the client: but if indulged in any inſtance, it muſt be indulged without reſerve; and therefore utility requires that it be
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0743600300:265"/>

               <p>A bond given to the defendant to procure in marriage to the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff a young gentlewoman of L. 2000 fortune, was decreed to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up; becauſe the match was unequal, the plaintiff being ſixty years of age, and having ſeven children <note n="‡" place="bottom">Abridg. caſes in equity, cap. 13. ſect.

               <p>RETENTION, which is an equitable exception reſembling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, was introduced by the court of ſeſſion without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a ſtatute. The ſtatute 1592, authoriſing compenſation, ſpeaks not of an obligation <hi>ad factum praeſtandum,</hi> nor of any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion other than for payment of money; and yet it is hard, that a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0743600300:266"/>
man ſhould have the authority of a court to make his claim effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual againſt me, while he refuſes or delays to ſatisfy the claim I have againſt him. So ſtands, however, the common law; which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a court of equity for the public good. Suppoſing parties once in court upon any particular affair, the adjuſting, without a new proceſs, all matters between them that can at preſent be adjuſted, is undoubtedly beneficial, becauſe it tends to abridge law-ſuits. This valuable end is attained, by beſtowing on the defendant a privilege to with-hold performance from the purſuer, till the purſuer <hi>ſimul et ſemel</hi> perform to him. This privilege is exerciſed by pleading it as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the purſuer's demand; and the exception, from its nature, is termed <hi>Retention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Compenſation, as we have ſeen, is founded on the principle of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. And it is alſo ſupported by that of utility; becauſe the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two counter-claims in the ſame proceſs tends to leſſen the number of law-ſuits. Retention, again, is founded ſolely on utility, being calculated for no other end but to prevent the multiplication of law-ſuits. The expedience of retention in this reſpect, has gained it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance in all civilized nations. In the Engliſh court of chancery particularly, it is a well-known exception, of which I give the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtance. <q rend="inline">"If the plaintiff mortgage his eſtate to the defendant, and afterward borrow money from the defendant upon bond, the redemption ought not to take place unleſs the bonded debt be paid as well as the mortgage-money <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Vernon 244.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>From what is ſaid, every ſort of obligation affords, as it would appear, a ground for retention, provided the term of performance be come, and no juſt cauſe for with-holding performance. It ſhall only be added, that for the reaſons given with reſpect to compenſation <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 201.</note>, retention cannot be pleaded againſt an aſſignee for a valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>A directed B to pay to C what ſums C ſhould want. C according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received two ſums (among others) from B, for which he gave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts as by the order of A. A and C came to account, which being ſtated, they gave mutual releaſes. But the two ſums not being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the books of A, were not accounted for by C. B not having received any allowance from A for the two ſums, prefers his bill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt C to have the money returned to him. C confeſſed the receipts, but inſiſted, that the money was delivered to him by the order of A, and that B being a hand only had no claim. But the court decreed,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0743600300:267"/>
That the plaintiff had a fair claim againſt the defendant to avoid cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity of ſuits: for otherwiſe it would turn the plaintiff on A, and A again on the defendant in equity to ſet aſide the releaſe, and to have an allowance of theſe ſums. And the decree was affirmed in the Houſe of Lords <note n="*" place="bottom">Shower's caſes in parliament, 17.</note>.</p>
               <p>By the common law of this land, a creditor introduced into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon a wadſet, upon an aſſignment to rents, or upon an adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is bound to ſurrender the poſſeſſion as ſoon as the debt is paid by the rents levied. He obtained poſſeſſion for a certain purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to levy the rents for his payment; and therefore, when that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is fulfilled, his right is at an end, and he is not any longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to poſſeſs. He perhaps is creditor in other debts that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to apprehend poſſeſſion <hi>de novo:</hi> but theſe will not, at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, impower him to detain the poſſeſſion one moment after the debt that was the title of his poſſeſſion is paid. He muſt firſt ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der poſſeſſion; and, if he think proper, he may thereafter apply for legal authority to enter again into poſſeſſion for payment of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate debts. A court of equity views matters in a different light. The debtor's claim to have his land reſtored to him is certainly not founded on utility, when ſuch claim can ſerve no other end but to multiply expence, by forcing the creditor to take out execution upon the ſeparate debt, in order to be repoſſeſſed. A maxim in the Roman law concludes in this caſe with its utmoſt force, <hi>Fruſtra petis quod mox es reſtituturus;</hi> and this maxim accordingly furniſheth to the creditor in poſſeſſion a defence which is a ſpecies of retention. There is, indeed, the ſame reaſon for ſuſtaining the exception of retention in this caſe, that there is in perſonal debts. The foundation of the exception is in both caſes the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the principle of utility, which is interpoſed to prevent the multiplying of law-ſuits, prejudicial to one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at leaſt, and beneficial to neither.</p>
               <p>But this relief againſt the ſtrictneſs of common law, ought not to be confined to real debts which intitle the creditor to poſſeſs. It may ſometimes happen, as demonſtrated above <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 212.</note>, to be more beneficial to the debtor or to the creditor, without hurting either, that the rents be applied for payment even of a perſonal debt, than for payment of the debt which is the title of poſſeſſion. And where-ever the rents may be applied for payment of a perſonal debt, the creditor muſt be privileged to hold the poſſeſſion till that debt be paid.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Bona fide <hi>payment.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the courſe of money-tranſactions, and the payment of debt, it may happen by miſtake that payment is made, not to the perſon who is really the creditor, but to one underſtood to be the creditor. However invincible the error may be, payment made to any but to the creditor avails not at common law; becauſe none but the creditor can diſcharge the debt. What remedy can be afforded by a court of equity where a debt is <hi>bona fide</hi> paid to another than the true creditor, is the ſubject of the preſent chapter.</p>
               <p>It is an obſervation verified by long experience, That no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance tends more to the advancement of commerce, than a free cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the goods of fortune from hand to hand. In this iſland, commercial law is ſo much improved, as that land, moveables, debts, have all of them a free and expedite currency. A bond for borrowed money, in particular, deſcends to heirs, and is readily transferrable to aſſignees voluntary or judicial. But that circumſtance, beneficial to commerce, proves in many inſtances hurtful to debtors. Payment made to any but the creditor, frees not the debtor at common law: and yet circumſtances may be often ſuch, as to make it impracticable for the debtor to diſcover that the perſon who produceth a title, fair in appearance, is not the creditor. Here is a caſe extremely nice in point of equity. On the one hand, if <hi>bona fide</hi> payment be not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the hardſhip will be great upon the debtor, who muſt pay a ſecond time to the true creditor. On the other hand, if the exception of <hi>bona fide</hi> payment be ſuſtained to protect the debtor from a ſecond payment, the creditor will be often forfeited of his debt without his fault. Here the ſcales hang even, and equity preponderates not on either ſide. But the principle of utility affords relief to the debtor, and exerts all its weight in his ſcale: for if a debtor were not ſecure by voluntary payment, no man would venture to pay a ſhilling by any authority leſs than that of the ſovereign court; and how ruinous to credit this would prove, muſt be obvious without taking a moment for reflection.</p>
               <p>To bring this matter nearer the eye, we ſhall firſt ſuppoſe that the putative creditor proceeds to legal execution, and in that manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers payment. Payment thus made by authority of law, muſt undoubtedly protect the debtor from a ſecond payment. And this
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0743600300:269"/>
leads to another caſe, That the debtor, to prevent legal execution which threatens him, makes payment voluntarily. The payment here is made indeed without compulſion, becauſe there is no actual execution: but then it is not made without authority; for, by the ſuppoſition, execution is awarded, and nothing prevents it but pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The third caſe is of a clear bond, upon which execution muſt be obtained as ſoon as demanded; and the debtor pays, knowing of no defence. Why ought not he alſo to be ſecure in this caſe? That he be ſecure, is beneficial to creditors as well as to debtors, becauſe otherwiſe there can be no free commerce of debts. This exception then of <hi>bona fide</hi> payment, is ſupported by the principle of utility in two different reſpects: it is beneficial to creditors, by encouraging debtors to make prompt payment; and by removing from them the pretext of inſiſting upon anxious and ſcrupulous defences, which, under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of paying ſecurely, would often be laid hold of to delay pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it is beneficial to debtors, who can pay with ſafety without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to ſuffer execution.</p>
               <p>But here the true creditor is not left without a remedy. The ſum received by the putative creditor is in his hand <hi>ſine juſta cauſa,</hi> and he is anſwerable for it to the true creditor. In this view, the operation of <hi>bona fide</hi> payment is only to ſubſtitute one debtor for another, which may as often be beneficial to the true creditor, as detrimental.</p>
               <p>An executor under a revoked will, being ignorant of the revocation, pays legacies; and the revocation is afterward proved: he ſhall be allowed theſe legacies <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Chancery caſes 126.</note>.</p>
               <p>If, in making payment to the putative creditor, the debtor obtain an eaſe, the exception of <hi>bona fide</hi> payment will be ſuſtained for that ſum only which was really paid <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, July 19. 1665, Johnſton contra Macgre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. VI. Interpoſition of a court of equity in favour even of a ſingle perſon to prevent miſchief.</head>
               <p>THIS ſubject is ſo fully explained in the introduction as to require very little addition. It exhibits a court of equity in a new light; ſhowing that this court, acting upon the principle of utility, is not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0743600300:270"/>
confined to what is properly termed <hi>juriſdiction,</hi> but, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miſchief even to a ſingle perſon, can aſſume magiſterial powers. It is by ſuch power that the court of ſeſſion names factors to manage the eſtates of thoſe who are in foreign parts, and of infants who are deſtitute of tutors. The authority interpoſed for ſelling the land-eſtate of a perſon under age, is properly of the ſame nature: for the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made about the debts, and about the rationality of a ſale, though in the form of a proceſs, is an expiſcation merely.</p>
               <p>By the Roman law, a ſale made by a tutor of his pupil's land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtate without authority of a judge, was void <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> as <hi>ultra vires.</hi> This ſeems not to have been followed in Scotland.

And I muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this deciſion as agreeable to principles and the nature of the thing. The interpoſition of a court beforehand, is not to beſtow new powers upon a tutor, but to certify the neceſſity of a ſale, in order to encourage purchaſers by rendering them ſecure. But if, without authority of a court, a purchaſer be found who pays a full price, and if the ſale be neceſſary, where can the objection lie? So far indeed a court may juſtly go, as to preſume leſion from a ſale <hi>ſine decreto,</hi> until the tutor juſtify the ſale as rational, and profitable to the infant.</p>

               <p>STATUTES, as hinted above <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 177.</note>, that have utility for their object, are of two kinds: Firſt, Statutes directed for promoting the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive good of the whole ſociety, or of ſome part: Second, Statutes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to prevent miſchief only. Defective ſtatutes of the latter kind may be ſupplied by a court of equity; becauſe, independent of a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, it is impowered to prevent miſchief. But that court has not, more than a court of common law, any power to ſupply defective ſtatutes of the former kind; becauſe it belongs to the legiſlature only to make laws or regulations for promoting good poſitively.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0743600300:271"/>
Uſury is in itſelf innocent, but to prevent oppreſſion it is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by ſtatute. Gaming is prohibited by ſtatute; as alſo the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing law-ſuits by members of the college of juſtice. Theſe in themſelves are not unjuſt; but they tend to corrupt the morals, and prove often ruinous to individuals. Such ſtatutes, preventive of wrong and miſchief, may be extended by a court of equity, in order to complete the remedy intended by the legiſlature. It is chiefly with relation to ſtatutes of this kind that Bacon delivers an opinion with great elegance: <q rend="inline">"Bonum publicum inſigne rapit ad ſe caſus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſos. Quamobrem, quando lex aliqua reipublicae commoda notabiliter et majorem in modum intuetur et procurat, interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ejus extenſiva eſto et amplians †."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this claſs, as appears to me, our ſtatute 1617 introducing the poſitive preſcription ought to be placed. For it has not, like the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>uſucapio,</hi> the penal effect of forfeiting a proprietor for his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and of transferring his property to another: it is calculated, on the contrary, to ſecure every man in his land-property, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing action upon old obſolete claims, which, by the common law, are perpetual. A claim may be very old and yet very juſt; and it is not therefore wrong in the common law to ſuſtain ſuch a claim. But then the conſequences ought to be conſidered: if a claim be ſuſtained beyond forty or fifty years becauſe it may be juſt, every claim muſt be ſuſtained however old; and experience diſcovered, that this opens a wide door to falſehood. To prevent wrong and miſchief, it was neceſſary that land-property ſhould by lapſe of time be ſecured againſt all claims; and as with reſpect to antiquated claims there is no infallible criterion to diſtinguiſh good from bad, it was neceſſary to bar them altogether by the lump. The paſſage quoted from Bacon is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in the ſtricteſt manner to this ſtatute, conſidered in the light now mentioned; and it hath accordingly been extended in order to complete the remedy afforded by the legiſlature. To ſecure land-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty againſt obſolete claims, it muſt be qualified, that the proprietor has poſſeſſed peaceably forty years by virtue of a charter and ſeiſin. So ſays the ſtatute; and if the ſtatute be taken ſtrictly, no property is protected from obſolete claims but where infeftment is the title of poſſeſſion. But the court of ſeſſion, preferring the end to the means, and conſulting its own powers as a court of equity to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, ſecures by preſcription every ſubject poſſeſſed upon a good title, a right to tithes for example, a long leaſe of land, or of tithes, which are titles that admit not infeftment <note place="bottom">* De augmentis ſcientiarum, l. 8. cap. 3. aphor. 12.</note>.</p>

As the foregoing ſtatute was made to ſecure land from obſolete and unjuſt claims, ſo the ſtatutes 1469 and 1474, introducing the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative preſcription of obligations, were made to ſecure individuals perſonally from claims of the ſame kind. As theſe ſtatutes all of them are preventive of miſchief, they may all of them be extended by a court of equity to complete the remedy. The ſtatutes accordingly now mentioned have been extended to mutual contracts, to decrees <hi>in foro contradictorio,</hi> and to reductions of deeds granted on death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note n="a" place="bottom">I am aware, that the ſtatutes introducing the negative preſcription have, by the court of ſeſſion, been conſidered in a different light. They have been held as a forfeiture even of a juſt debt; for it was once judged, that after the forty years the defendant was not bound to give his oath upon the verity of the debt; and that though he ſhould acknowledge the debt to be juſt, yet he was not liable <hi>in foro humano,</hi> however he might be liable <hi>in foro poli et con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiae; Fountainhall, December</hi> 7. 1703, <hi>Napier contra Campbell.</hi> That this is a wrong conſtruction of theſe ſtatutes I have endeavoured to ſhow above, <hi>p.</hi> 197.</note>.</p>
               <p>Conſidering the inſtances above mentioned, it muſt, I imagine, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſome ſurpriſe, to find a propoſition cheriſhed by our lawyers, That correctory ſtatutes, as they are termed, ought never to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. We have already ſeen this propoſition contradicted, not only by ſolid principles, but even by the court of ſeſſion in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. With relation to ſtatutes, in particular, correctory of injuſtice or of wrong, no man can ſeriouſly doubt that a court of equity is impowered to extend ſuch ſtatutes, in order to complete the remedy preſcribed by the legiſlature: and the ſame is equally clear with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſtatutes ſupplying defects in common law. As to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes under conſideration, calculated to prevent miſchief, it might, I own, have once been more doubtful whether theſe could be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for of all the powers aſſumed by a court of equity, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the power of preventing miſchief was the lateſt. But in England this power has been long eſtabliſhed in the court of chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and experience has proved it to be a ſalutary power. Why then ſhould we ſtop ſhort in the middle of our progreſs? No other excuſe can be given for ſuch heſitation, but that our law, conſidered as a regular ſyſtem, is of a much later date than that of England.</p>
               <p>The foregoing are inſtances where the court of ſeſſion, without heſitation, have ſupplied defects in ſtatutes made to prevent miſchief. But to ſhow how deſultory and fluctuating the practice of the court is in that particular, I ſhall confine myſelf to a ſingle caſe on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, which makes a figure in our law. In the tranſmiſſion of land-property, by ſucceſſion as well as by ſale, we require infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0743600300:273"/>
An heir however, without completing his right by infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is intitled to continue the poſſeſſion of his anceſtor <note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical Law-tracts, tract 5.</note>. In this ſituation, behaving as proprietor, he contracts debts, and unleſs he be reduced to the neceſſity of borrowing large ſums, thoſe he deals with are ſeldom ſo ſcrupulous as to inquire into his title. By the common law however, the debtor's death before infeftment is, as to the real eſtate, a forfeiture of all his perſonal creditors. This is a miſchief which well deſerved the interpoſition of the legiſlature; and a remedy was provided by act 24. parl. 1695, enacting, <q rend="inline">"That if an apparent heir have been in poſſeſſion for three years, the next heir, who by ſervice or adjudication connects with the predeceſſor laſt infeft, ſhall be liable to the apparent heir's debts <hi>in valorem</hi> of the heritage."</q> It cannot be doubted, that a complete remedy was here intended, to give a reaſonable ſecurity that thoſe who deal with heirs-apparent ſhall obtain payment of their debts. And yet, if we regard the words only, the remedy is imperfect; for what if the next heir-apparent, purpoſely to evade the ſtatute, ſhall content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of the heritage, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up titles by ſervice or adjudication? Upon this ſtrict conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtatute, the creditors will reap little benefit. For if the debts be conſiderable, no heir will ſubject himſelf by completing his titles, when he is admitted to the poſſeſſion, and has the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the rents, without any title. Formerly the heir-apparent in poſſeſſion had no intereſt to forbear the completing his titles: his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect muſt have been aſcribed to indolence or to inattention. But if the remedy intended by the ſtatute reach not the heir-apparent in poſſeſſion, a ſtrong motive of intereſt ariſes to make him forbear the completing his titles. In this view, the ſtatute, if confined to the words, muſt appear extremely abſurd. Here is indeed a remedy provided for a legal wrong: but what ſort of remedy? A remedy ſo ſtrangely contrived, as to depend entirely upon that very perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom it is directed: for it is always in the power of the heir, by ſatisfying himſelf with a poſſeſſory title, to diſappoint the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their remedy; and as by this poſſeſſory title he has the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the eſtate, he will always diſappoint them, if he regard his own intereſt. The legiſlature in this caſe undoubtedly intended a complete remedy; and the conſideration now mentioned, peculiar to this caſe, is a ſtrong additional motive for the interpoſition of a court of equity to fulfil the intendment of the legiſlature. And yet, miſled by the notion that correctory laws ought not to be extended,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0743600300:274"/>
the court of ſeſſion hath conſtantly denied action to the creditors of an heir who dies in apparency, againſt the next heir in poſſeſſion who has not completed his title to the eſtate by ſervice or adjudication.</p>
               <p>There is another palpable defect in this ſtatute which ought alſo to be ſupplied in equity. A predeceſſor may have a good title to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate without being infeft; and yet regarding the words only, the heir-apparent is not liable upon this ſtatute, unleſs where he connects with a predeceſſor infeft. I put the following caſe. A purchaſes an eſtate, takes a diſpoſition with procuratory and precept, but dies without being ſeiſed. B, his heir-apparent, enters into poſſeſſion without making up titles, and contracts debt after being in poſſeſſion three years. After his death, C, the next heir-apparent, makes up his titles by a general ſervice. This caſe comes not under the words of the ſtatute; but as it undoubtedly comes under the miſchief which the legiſlature intended to remedy, it is the duty of a court of equity to complete the remedy.</p>
               <p>In one caſe the court, from a due ſenſe of their equitable powers, ventured upon a remedy where this ſtatute was defective. Some acres and houſes having been diſponed for a valuable conſideration by an heir-apparent three years in poſſeſſion, the next heir-apparent foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would be barred by the act 1695 from objecting to this alienation if he ſhould enter heir, bethought himſelf of a different method. He ſold the ſubject for twenty guineas, and granted bond to the purchaſer, who led an adjudication againſt the eſtate, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that title brought a reduction of the diſpoſition in his own name. But the court decreed, that this caſe fell under the meaning of the ſtatute, though not under the words; and therefore that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuer was barred from challenging the diſpoſition <note n="*" place="bottom">Burns of Dorater contra Pickens, July 11. 1758.</note>.</p>
               <p>What if the heir forbearing to enter, in order to evade the act 1695, ſhall contract debt to the value of the ſubject, upon which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judications are led <hi>contra hereditatem jacentem?</hi> Here the eſtate is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for payment of the heir's debts, and conſequently converted to his uſe as much as if he were entered. Would the court of ſeſſion give no relief in this caſe to the creditors of the interjected heir-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent? Would they ſuffer the purpoſe of the ſtatute to be ſo groſsly eluded?</p>
               <p>A word or two upon ſtatutes to which the power of a court of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity reacheth not in any degree. Monopolies or perſonal privileges cannot be extended by a court of equity <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 1. § 2. De conſtitut. princ.</note>; becauſe that court may
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0743600300:275"/>
prevent miſchief, but has no power to do any act for enriching any perſon, or making him <hi>locupletior,</hi> as termed in the Roman law. As to penal ſtatutes again, it is clear in the firſt place, that to augment a penalty beyond that directed by a ſtatute is acting in contradiction to the ſtatute, which enacts that preciſe penalty and not a greater. In the next place, to extend the penalty in a ſtatute to a caſe not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is a power not truſted with any court, becauſe the truſt is not neceſſary. A penalty is generally added to a ſtatutory prohibition. A court of equity may extend the prohibition to ſimilar caſes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven puniſh the tranſgreſſion of their own prohibition <note n="*" place="bottom">Book 1. part 1. chap. 5.</note>; but it is a prerogative peculiar to the legiſlature to annex beforehand a penal ſanction to a prohibition.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION of BOOK II.</head>
               <p>THE principle of juſtice, though more extenſive in its influence than that of utility, is in its nature more ſimple: it never looks beyond the parties engaged in the ſuit. The principle of utility, on the contrary, not only regards the parties engaged in the ſuit, but alſo the ſociety in general; and comprehends many circumſtances concerning both. Being thus in its nature and application more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate than juſtice, I thought it not amiſs to cloſe this book with a few thoughts upon it. In the introduction there was occaſion to hint, that utility co-operates ſometimes with juſtice, and in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevails over it. This propoſition is verified in the firſt book by ſeveral inſtances, which I propoſe to bring under one view, in order to give a diſtinct notion of the co-operation and oppoſition of theſe principles.</p>
               <p>It is ſcarce neceſſary to be premiſed, that in oppoſing private utility to juſtice, the latter ought always to prevail. A man is not bound to proſecute what is beneficial to him: he is not even bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand reparation for wrong done him. But he is ſtrictly bound to do his duty; and for that reaſon he himſelf muſt be conſcious, that in oppoſition to duty intereſt ought to have no weight. It is beſide of great importance to ſociety that juſtice have a free courſe; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly public utility unites with juſtice to inforce right againſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Private intereſt therefore, or private utility, may, in the preſent ſpeculation, be laid entirely aſide; and it is barely mentioned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miſtakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0743600300:276"/>
Another limitation is neceſſary. It is not every ſort of public uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that can outbalance juſtice: it is that ſort only which is preventive of miſchief affecting the whole or bulk of the ſociety. To prevent miſchief to an individual coincides with private intereſt; and as to public utility, ſo far as it concerns a poſitive additional good to the ſociety, it is a ſubject that comes not within the ſphere of a court of equity.</p>
               <p>Confining our view then to public utility directed to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, I venture to lay down the following propoſition, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is at variance with juſtice, a court of equity ought not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the latter, nor ſuffer it to be inforced by a court of common law. In order to evince this propoſition, which I ſhall endeavour to do by induction, the proper method will be, to give a table of caſes, beginning with thoſe where the two principles are in ſtrict u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and proceeding orderly to thoſe where they are in declared op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>In general, theſe principles for the moſt part are good friends. The great end of eſtabliſhing a court of equity is, to have juſtice accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtributed, even in the moſt delicate circumſtances; and nothing contributes more to peace and union in ſociety than that this great end be ſteadily proſecuted and completely fulfilled. As this branch therefore of utility is inſeparable from juſtice, it will not be neceſſary hereafter to make any expreſs mention of it. It muſt be always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood when we talk of juſtice.</p>
               <p>We proceed to other branches of utility, which are not ſo ſtrictly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to juſtice, but ſometimes coincide with it, and ſometimes riſe in oppoſition. One of theſe is the benefit accruing to the ſociety by abridging law-ſuits. In the caſe of compenſation, utility unites with juſtice to make compenſation a ſtrong plea in every court of equity. Retention again depends entirely upon the utility of abridging law-ſuits. But if it have no ſupport from juſtice, neither is it oppoſed by juſtice.</p>
               <p>In the caſe of <hi>bona fide</hi> payment the utility is different. It is the benefit accruing to a mercantile ſociety by giving a free courſe to money-tranſactions, which would be obſtructed if debtors, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any riſk in making payment, were encouraged to ſtate anxious or frivolous defences. The exception of <hi>bona fide</hi> payment is ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon no other ground but that of preventing the miſchief here deſcribed. Juſtice weighs equally on both ſides; for if the exception be not ſuſtained, the honeſt debtor bears the hazard of loſing his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0743600300:277"/>
money: if it be ſuſtained, the hazard is transferred upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor.</p>
               <p>But there are caſes where juſtice and utility take oppoſite ſides: which, in particular, is the caſe where a tranſaction extremely unequal is occaſioned by error. Here the juſtice of affording relief is obvious: but then a tranſaction by putting an end to ſtrife is a favourite of law; and it is againſt the intereſt of the public to weigh a tranſaction in the nice balance of grains and ſcruples. A man, by care and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in making a tranſaction, may avoid error; but the bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of opening tranſactions upon every ground of equity cannot be avoided. Juſtice therefore muſt in this caſe yield to utility; and a tranſaction will be ſupported againſt errors that may be ſufficient to overturn other agreements. I give another example. In the Roman law <hi>laeſio ultra duplum</hi> was ſuſtained to void a bargain: but in Britain we refuſe to liſten to equity in this caſe; for if complaints of inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were indulged, law-ſuits would be multiplied, to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of commerce.</p>
               <p>If the diſcouraging law-ſuits be ſufficient to with-hold relief in equity, the hazard of making judges arbitrary is a much ſtronger motive for with-holding that relief. However clear a juſt claim or defence may be, a court of equity ought not to interpoſe, unleſs the caſe can be brought under a general rule. No ſort of oppreſſion is more intolerable than what is done under the colour of law: and for that reaſon, judges ought to be confined to general rules, the only method invented to prevent legal oppreſſion. Here the refuſing to do juſtice to a ſingle perſon makes no figure, when ſet in oppoſition to an important intereſt that concerns deeply the whole ſociety. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it ſeems to follow, from the very nature of a court of equity, that it ought to adhere to general rules, even at the expence of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to do juſtice. It is the declared purpoſe of a court of equity, to promote the good of ſociety by an accurate diſtribution of juſtice: but the means ought to be ſubordinate to the end; and therefore, if in any caſe juſtice cannot be done but by uſing means that tend to the hurt of ſociety, a court of equity ought not to interpoſe. To be active in ſuch a caſe, involves the abſurdity of preferring the means to the end.</p>
               <p>Thus we may gather by induction, that in every caſe where it is the intereſt of the public to with-hold juſtice from an individual, it becomes the duty of a court of equity in that circumſtance, not only to abſtain from inforcing the juſt claim or defence, but alſo to prevent
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0743600300:278"/>
its being inforced at common law. But the influence of public utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtops here, and never authoriſes a court of equity to inforce any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive act of injuſtice <note n="*" place="bottom">See this doctrine illuſtrated, Hiſtorical Law-tracts, tract 2.</note>. For, firſt, I cannot diſcover that it ever can be the intereſt of the public to require the doing an unjuſt action. And, next, if even ſelf-preſervation will not juſtify any wrong done by a private perſon <note n="†" place="bottom">Preliminary diſcourſe, p. 13.</note>, much leſs will public utility, ſuppoſing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, be able to juſtify any wrong done or inforced by a court of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. It is inconſiſtent with the very conſtitution of this court to do injuſtice, or to inforce it.</p>

            <p>HITHERTO our plan has been, to ſet forth the different powers of a court of equity; and to illuſtrate theſe powers by apt examples ſelected from various ſubjects where they could be beſt found. Our plan in the preſent book is, to ſhow the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe powers to various ſubjects, handled each as an entire whole: and the ſubjects choſen are ſuch as cannot eaſily be ſplit into parts to be diſtributed under the different heads formerly explained. Beſide, as the various powers of a court of equity have been ſufficiently illuſtrated, as well as the principles on which they are founded, I thought it would be pleaſant as well as inſtructive to vary the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, by connecting together theſe powers and principles in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation upon particular ſubjects. Thus the diſtribution of the whole appears in the following light: the firſt and ſecond books may be conſidered as theoretical, containing the powers of a court of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the principles on which theſe powers are founded; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent book is practical, containing the application of theſe powers and principles to ſeveral important ſubjects.</p>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. What equity rules with reſpect to rents levied upon an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous title of property.</head>
               <p>WITH reſpect to land poſſeſſed upon an erroneous title of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is a rule eſtabliſhed in the Roman law, and among mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern nations, That the true proprietor aſſerting his right to the land, has not a claim for the rents levied by the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. But though this ſubject is handled at large both by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lawyers, and by their commentators, we are left in the dark as to the reaſon of the rule, and of the principle upon which it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Perhaps it was thought, that the proprietor has not an action at common law for the value of the product conſumed by the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor; or perhaps, that the action, as rigorous and unjuſt, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ineffectual by equity. And indeed, as no title of property can abſolutely be relied on, ſad would be the condition of land-holders,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0743600300:280"/>
could they be made liable forty years back, for rents which they had reaſon to believe their own, and which without ſcruple they beſtow'd upon the neceſſaries and conveniencies of life.</p>
               <p>Though, in all views, the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor is ſecure againſt reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is however of importance to aſcertain the preciſe principle that affords him ſecurity; for upon that preliminary point ſeveral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant queſtions depend. We ſhall therefore without further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face enter upon the inquiry.</p>
               <p>The poſſeſſor, as obſerved, muſt, for his ſecurity, be indebted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the common law or to equity. If common law afford to the proprietor a claim for the value of his rents conſumed, it muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity correcting the rigor of common law that protects the poſſeſſor from this claim: but if the proprietor have not a claim at common law, the poſſeſſor has no occaſion for equity. The matter then is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable into the following queſtion, Whether there be or be not a claim at common law. And to this queſtion, which is ſubtile, we muſt lend attention.</p>
               <p>Searching for materials to reaſon upon, what firſt occurs is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between natural and induſtrial fruits. The former, owing their exiſtence not to man but to the land ſolely, will readily be thought an acceſſory that muſt follow the property of the land. The latter will be viewed in a different light; for induſtrial fruits owe their exiſtence to labour and induſtry, more than to the land. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very circumſtance does Juſtinian found the right of the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor: <q rend="inline">"Si quis a non domino quem dominum eſſe credide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, bona fide fundum emerit, vel ex donatione, aliave qualibet juſta cauſa, aeque bona fide acceperit; naturalirationi placuit, fructus, quos percepit, ejus eſſe pro cultura et cura. Et ideo, ſi poſtea dominus ſupervenerit, et fundum vindicet, de fructibus ab eo conſumptis agere non poteſt <note n="*" place="bottom">§ 35. Inſtit. De rer. diviſione.</note>."</q> And upon this foundation Pomponius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, that the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor acquires right to the induſtrial fruits only: <q rend="inline">"Fructus percipiendo, uxor vel vir, ex re donata, ſuos facit: illos tamen quos ſuis operis adquiſierit, veluti ſerendo. Nam ſi pomum decerpſerit, vel ex ſylva cedit, non fit ejus: ſicuti nec cujuſlibet bonae fidei poſſeſſoris, quia non ex facto ejus fructus naſcitur <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 45. De uſuris.</note>."</q> Paulus goes farther. He admits not any diſtinction between natural and induſtrial fruits; but is poſitive, that both kinds equally, as ſoon as ſeparated from the ground, belong to the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor: <q rend="inline">"Bonae fidei emptor non dubie percipiendo fructus, etiam
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0743600300:281"/>
ex aliena re, ſuos interim facit, non tantum eos qui diligentia et opera ejus pervenerunt, ſed omnes; quia quod ad fructus attinet, loco domini pene eſt. Denique etiam, priuſquam percipiat, ſtatim ubi a ſolo ſeparati ſunt, bonae fidei emptoris fiunt <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 48. pr. De acquir. rer. dom.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But now, after drawing ſo nigh in appearance to a concluſion, we ſtumble upon an unexpected obſtruction. Is the foregoing doctrine conſiſtent with the principle <hi>Quod ſatum ſolo cedit ſolo?</hi> If corns while growing make part of the ground, and conſequently belong to the proprietor of the ground, the act of ſeparation merely, cannot have the effect to transfer the property from him to another. And if this hold as to fruits that are induſtrial, the argument concludes with greater force if poſſible as to natural fruits. What then ſhall be thought of the opinions delivered above by the Roman writers? Their authority is great I confeſs, and yet no authority will juſtify us in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating from clear principles. The fruits, induſtrial as well as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, after ſeparation as well as before, belong to the proprietor of the land. He has undoubtedly an action at common law to vindicate the fruits while extant: and if ſo, has he not alſo a claim for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue after conſumption?</p>
               <p>However prone we may be to anſwer the foregoing queſtion in the affirmative, let us however ſuſpend our judgement till the queſtion be fairly canvaſſed. It is indeed clear, that the fruits while extant, the <hi>percepti</hi> as well as <hi>pendentes,</hi> belong to the proprietor of the land, and can be claimed by a <hi>rei vindicatio</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Whether he may not in equity be liable for ſome recompence to the perſon by whoſe labour the induſtrial fruits were raiſed, is a different queſtion.</note>. But is it equally clear, that the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor who conſumes the fruits is liable for their value? Upon what medium is this claim founded? The fruits are indeed conſumed by the poſſeſſor, and the proprietor is thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his property: but it cannot be ſubſumed, that he is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it by the fault of the poſſeſſor; for, by the ſuppoſition, the poſſeſſor was <hi>in bona fide</hi> to conſume, and was not guilty of the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fault. Let us endeavour to gather light from a ſimilar caſe. A man buys a horſe <hi>bona ſide</hi> from one who is not proprietor: upon ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent buſineſs he makes a very ſevere journey, and the horſe, unable to ſupport the fatigue, dies. Is the purchaſer anſwerable for the value of the horſe? There is no principle of law upon which that claim can be founded. In general, a proprietor deprived of his goods by the fact of another, cannot claim the value upon any footing but that of reparation: but it is a rule eſtabliſhed both in the law of nature
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0743600300:282"/>
and in municipal law, That a man free from fault or blame, is not liable to repair any hurt done by him: one in all reſpects innocent, is not ſubjected to reparation more than to puniſhment <note n="*" place="bottom">See the preliminary diſcourſe.</note>. And thus it comes out clear, that there is no action at common law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor for the value of the fruits he conſumes: ſuch an action muſt reſolve into a claim of damages, to which the innocent cannot be ſubjected.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>bona fides</hi> protect the poſſeſſor when he himſelf conſumes the fruits, it will equally protect his tenants. A man who takes a leaſe from one who is held to be proprietor of the land, is <hi>in bona fide</hi> as well as his landlord. The fruits, therefore, that the tenant conſumes or diſpoſes of, will not ſubject him to a claim of damages; and if the proprietor have no claim for their value, he can as little claim the rent paid for them.</p>
               <p>As the common law affords not an action in this caſe, equity is ſtill more averſe to ſuch action. The proprietor no doubt is a loſer; and, which is a more material circumſtance, what he loſes is converted to the uſe of the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor. But then, though the proprietor be a loſer, the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor is not a gainer: the fruits or rents are conſumed upon living, and not a veſtige of them remains <note n="a" place="bottom">The <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor cannot be reached by an <hi>actio in rem verſum;</hi> for this action takes place only where the goods applied to my uſe are known by me to belong to another.</note>. Thus equity rules even where the claim is brought recently. But where it is brought at a diſtance of time, for the rents of many years, againſt a poſſeſſor who regularly conſumed his annual income, and had no reaſon to dread or ſuſpect a claim, the hardſhip is ſo great, and the claim itſelf in theſe circumſtances ſo unjuſt, that were it founded on common law, the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor would undoubtedly be relieved againſt it by equity.</p>
               <p>What is now ſaid ſuggeſts another caſe. Suppoſe the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor to be <hi>locupletior</hi> by the rents he has levied. It is in moſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances difficult to aſcertain this point: but circumſtances may be ſuppoſed to make it clear. The rents, for example, are aſſigned by the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor for payment of his proper debts: the creditors continue in poſſeſſion till their claims are wholly extinguiſhed; and then the true proprietor diſcovering his right, enters upon the ſtage. Here it can be qualified, that the <hi>bona ſide</hi> poſſeſſor is <hi>locupletior,</hi> and that he has gained preciſely the amount of the debts now ſatisfied and paid. Admitting then the fact, that the <hi>bona ſide</hi> poſſeſſor is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by his poſſeſſion, the queſtion is, Whether this circumſtance
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0743600300:283"/>
will ſupport any action againſt him? None at common law, for the reaſon above given, that there is nothing to found an action of repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or damages in this caſe, more than where the rents are conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon living. But that equity affords an action is clear; for the maxim <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura</hi> is applicable to this caſe in the ſtricteſt ſenſe: the effects of the proprietor are converted to the uſe of the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor: what is loſt by the one, is gained by the other; and therefore, equity lays hold of that gain to make up the loſs. This point is ſo evidently founded on equity, that even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repeated inſtances of wandering from juſtice in other points, I cannot help teſtifying ſome ſurpriſe, that the celebrated Vinnius, not to mention Voet and other commentators, ſhould reject the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's claim even in this caſe. And I am the more ſurpriſed, that in this opinion they make a ſtep not leſs bold than uncommon, which is, to deſert their guides who paſs for being infallible, I mean the Roman writers, who juſtly maintain that the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor is liable <hi>quatenus locupletior.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Conſuluit ſenatus bonae fidei poſſeſſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ne in totum damno adficiantur, ſed in id duntaxat teneantur in quo locupletiores facti ſunt. Quemcunque igitur ſumptum fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerint ex hereditate, ſi quid dilapidaverunt, perdiderunt, dum re ſua ſe abuti putant, non praeſtabunt: nec ſi donaverint, locuple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiores facti videbuntur, quamvis ad remunerandum ſibi aliquem na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliter obligaverunt <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 25. § 11. De hered. pet.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor becomes <hi>locupletior</hi> by extreme frugality and parſimony, it may be more doubtful whether a claim can lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. It muſt appear hard, that his ſtarving himſelf and his family, or his extraordinary anxiety to lay up a ſtock for his children, ſhould ſubject him to a claim which his prodigality would free him from; and yet I cannot ſee that this conſideration will prevent the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the maxim <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The foregoing diſquiſition is not only curious but uſeful. Among other things, it ſerves to determine an important queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>bona fides,</hi> which relieves the poſſeſſor from accounting for the rents, will at the ſame time prevent the imputation of theſe rents toward extinction of a real debt belonging to him. A man, for example, who has claims upon an eſtate by infeftments of annualrent, adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, or ſuch like, enters into poſſeſſion upon a title of property which he believes to be unexceptionable. When the lameneſs of his title is diſcovered, his <hi>bona fides</hi> will ſecure him from accounting for the rents to the true proprietor; but will it alſo preſerve his debts
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0743600300:284"/>
alive, and ſave them from being extinguiſhed by his poſſeſſion of the rents? The anſwer to this queſtion depends upon the point diſcuſſed above. If the proprietor have, at common law though not in equity, a claim for the value of the rents conſumed by the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor, this value, as appears to me, muſt go in extinction of the debts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the ſubject. For when the proprietor, inſtead of demanding the money to be paid to himſelf, inſiſts only, that it ſhall be apply'd to extinguiſh the real incumbrances; equity interpoſeth not againſt this demand, which is neither rigorous nor unjuſt: and if equity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe not, the extinction muſt take place. If, on the other hand, there be no claim at common law for the value of the rents conſumed, I cannot perceive any foundation for extinguiſhing the real debts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the poſſeſſor; unleſs the following propoſition can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, That the very act of levying the rents extinguiſhes <hi>ipſo facto</hi> theſe debts, without neceſſity of applying to a judge for his interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This propoſition holds true where a real debt is the title for le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying the rents; as, for example, where they are levied upon a poind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ground, or upon an adjudication completed by a decree of mails and duties. But it cannot hold in the caſe under conſideration; becauſe, by the very ſuppoſition, the rents are levied upon a title of property, and not by virtue of the real debts.</p>
               <p>I illuſtrate this point by ſtating the following caſe. An adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger infeft enters into poſſeſſion of the land adjudged after the legal is expired, conſidering his adjudication to be a right of property. After many years poſſeſſion, the perſon againſt whom the adjudication was led, or his heir, claims the property, urging a defect in the adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which prevented expiration of the legal. It is decreed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that the adjudication never became a right of property, but that the legal is ſtill current. Here it comes out in fact, that the land has all along been poſſeſſed upon the title of a real debt, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable by levying the rents, though by the poſſeſſor underſtood to be a title of property. I think, that even in this caſe the levying the rents will not extinguiſh the debt. I give my reaſon. To give vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary payment its full effect, two acts muſt concur, <hi>viz.</hi> delivery by the debtor in order to extinguiſh the debt, and acceptance by the creditor as payment. In legal payment by execution there muſt alſo be two acts; firſt, levying the rent in order to be apply'd for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the debt; and, next, the creditor's receiving the ſame as pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: neither of which acts are found in the caſe under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The rent is levied, not by virtue of execution in order to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a debt, but upon a title of property: neither is the rent received
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0743600300:285"/>
by a creditor as payment, but by a man who conceives himſelf to be proprietor.</p>
               <p>The foregoing reaſoning, which becauſe of its intricacy is drawn out to a conſiderable length, may, when thoroughly apprehended, be brought within a narrow compaſs. A <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor who le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies and conſumes the rents, is not liable to account to the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor whoſe rents they were, nor is ſubjected to any action whether in law or in equity; and for that reaſon his poſſeſſion of the rents will not have the effect to extinguiſh any debt in his perſon affecting the ſubject. But if it can be ſpecified that he is <hi>locupletior</hi> by his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that circumſtance affords to the proprietor a claim againſt him in equity; of which the proprietor, at his option, may either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand payment, or inſiſt that the ſum be applied for extinguiſhing the debts upon the ſubject.</p>
               <p>In theſe concluſions I have been forc'd to differ from the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practice of the court of ſeſſion, which indeed protects the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor from payment; but always holds the poſſeſſion as ſufficient to extinguiſh the real debts belonging to the poſſeſſor. But I have had the leſs reluctance in differing from the eſtabliſhed practice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible that this matter has not been examined with all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy of which it is ſuſceptible. In particular, we are not told up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground the practice is founded: and if it be founded on the ſuppoſition that the proprietor has a legal claim for his rents le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied by the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor, I have clearly proved this to be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition merely without any foundation.</p>
               <p>Another important queſtion has a near analogy to that now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed. If the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor have made conſiderable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the ſubject, by which its value is increaſed, will his claim be ſuſtained as far as the proprietor is benefited by theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, or will it be compenſated by the rents he has levied? Keeping in view what is ſaid upon the foregoing queſtion, one will readily anſwer, that the proprietor, having no claim for the rents le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied and conſumed by the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor, has no ground upon which to plead compenſation: But upon a more narrow inſpection, we perceive, that this queſtion depends upon a different principle. It is a maxim ſuggeſted by nature, That the expence laid out in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any benefit is a preferable burden upon the profits made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and in particular, that reparations and meliorations beſtowed upon a houſe or upon land ought to be defray'd out of the rents. Governed by this maxim, we ſuſtain no claim againſt the proprietor for meliorations, if the expence exceed not the rents levied by the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0743600300:286"/>
                  <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor. It is not properly compenſation; for the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has no claim to found a compenſation upon. The claim is reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a different medium: the rents while extant belong to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of the ground: theſe rents are not conſumed, but are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon meliorations; and the <hi>bona fide</hi> poſſeſſor who thus employs the proprietor's money, and not a farthing of his own, has no claim either in law or in equity. Such accordingly is the determination of Papinian, the moſt ſolid of all the Roman writers: <q rend="inline">"Sumptus in praedium, quod alienum eſſe apparuit, a bona fide poſſeſſore facti, neque ab eo qui praedium donavit, neque a domino peti poſſunt; verum, exceptione doli poſita, per officium judicis aequitatis ratione ſervantur; ſcilicet ſi fructuum ante litem conteſtatam perceptorum ſummam excedunt. Etenim, admiſſa compenſatione, ſuperſluum ſumptum, meliore praedio facto, dominus reſtituere cogitur <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 48. De rel. vindicatione.</note>."</q>

               <head>CHAP. II. Powers of a court of equity with reſpect to a conventional penalty.</head>
               <p>CONVENTIONAL penalties are of two kinds. One is, where a perſon bound <hi>ad factum praeſtandum</hi> agrees, in caſe of failure, to pay a ſum of money: the other is, where a ſum is ſtipulated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force performance of any obligation.</p>
               <p>The firſt kind is explained by Juſtinian in the following words. <q rend="inline">"Non ſolum res in ſtipulatum deduci poſſunt, ſed etiam facta; ut ſi ſtipulemur aliquid fieri vel non fieri. Et in hujuſmodi ſtipulationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus optimum erit poenam ſubjicere, ne quantitas ſtipulationis in incerto ſit, ac neceſſe ſit actori probare quod ejus interſit. Itaque ſi quis, ut fiat aliquid, ſtipuletur; ita adjici poena debet, <hi>Si ita fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non erit, tunc poenae nomine decem aureos dare ſpondes</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">§ 7. Inſtit. De verb. oblig.</note>."</q> A ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this kind conſtitutes properly an alternative obligation, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in the option of the obligor to perform the fact, or in place of it to pay the penal ſum. And it muſt be obſerved, that this ſum is improperly termed <hi>a penalty;</hi> for it is in reality a liquidation of the damages that the obligee ſuffers by want of performance; or rather a lump ſum agreed on in place of damages. A ſum thus ſtipulated, having nothing penal in its nature, is due in equity as well as at common law. Thus land being verbally ſet to a tenant, under the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0743600300:287"/>
following condition, That if he entered not he ſhould pay a year's rent; the whole penalty was decreed, becauſe the tenant entered not <note n="*" place="bottom">Durie, July 15. 1637, Skene.</note>.</p>
               <p>The other kind of penalty is, where, beſide performance of what is ſtipulated in the contract, the obligor is taken bound, if he fail of punctual performance, to pay a ſum over and above: as, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the debtor becomes bound to pay the ſum borrowed at a term ſpecified; and, in order to inforce punctual performance, he becomes bound, if he ſuffer the term to elapſe without payment, to pay an additional ſum. Here, in caſe of failure, both articles muſt be fulfilled, the additional article as well as that which is principal; and therefore the additional article is more properly a penalty than that firſt mentioned, where the obligation is alternative.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to a penalty of this kind, it is clear, that a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt performance of what is principal, will relieve alſo from the penalty: but if there be no good defence, the penalty is due by agreement as ſoon as there is a failure in the performance; and may be demanded at common law by an action <hi>ex contractu.</hi> Voet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſays, <q rend="inline">"Committitur haec poenae ſtipulatio, ſi principalis obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio, quae ſtipulatione penali firmata erat, impleta non ſit, cum de jure implenda fuiſſet <note n="†" place="bottom">§ 13. De verb. oblig.</note>."</q> And to prove this poſition he gives the authority of Paulus in the following words: <q rend="inline">"Ad diem ſub poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na pecunia promiſſa, et ante diem mortuo promiſſore, committe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur poena, licet non ſit hereditas ejus adita <note n="‡" place="bottom">l. 77. ibid.</note>."</q> For here the death of the debtor before the term of payment afforded no legal defence to his heir; nor ought the creditor to ſuffer by that accident, <hi>cui de jure implenda erat obligatio,</hi> in the foregoing words of Voet.</p>
               <p>Whether and how far equity will mitigate a penalty of this kind, comes next to be conſidered. What will at firſt occur is, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh culpable failure from what is innocent, and to afford relief in the latter caſe only. But a more accurate inſpection will ſhow this to be an Utopian thought, unſuited to practice. The extreme diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of making good this diſtinction by evidence, would render judges arbitrary, without attaining that refinement of juſtice which is intended by the diſtinction: and therefore it becomes neceſſary in practice to give relief to all without diſtinction, unleſs where it can be made clearly appear that the failure is culpable.</p>
               <p>The next point is, How far equity will relieve. When an obligor who performs late, demands to be relieved from the penal ſum, juſtice requires that the obligee be indemnified of what damage he has ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0743600300:288"/>
by the delay; according to a rule in equity formerly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which the Engliſh lawyers expreſs thus, <q rend="inline">"He that demands e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity muſt give equity."</q> And hence in this iſland it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice to decree the penalty to the extent of the damage; and this the obligee is intitled to, however innocent or involuntary the delay may have been. A debtor, for example, diſappoined of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, fails to make payment at the term covenanted, which draws up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him a ſtorm of execution: however innocent, he muſt pay the penalty reſtricted to the expence of execution; becauſe the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional penalty ſo far is not a puniſhment upon the debtor, but repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the creditor; and ſo far it is due in equity as well as at common law. Take another example. A debtor ſuſpends his bond <hi>bona fide;</hi> and the creditor, after diſcuſſing the ſuſpenſion, is ſatisfied to reſtrict his penalty to the coſts of ſuit: the penalty thus reſtricted is not a penal claim, and therefore is due in equity as well as at common law. This example may be viewed in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent light: there muſt be error, at leaſt, in every caſe where the obligor refuſes to fulfil a juſt claim, however innocent he may be; and equity relieves from the effect of error, ſo far only as the perſon who takes the advantage of the error is <hi>in lucro captando,</hi> not where he is <hi>in damno evitando</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See p. 98.</note>.</p>
               <p>An Engliſh double bond is an example of the ſecond kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventional penalties. It was introduced originally to evade the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of England, which prohibits the taking intereſt for money: and though that prohibition be no longer in force, the double bond continues in practice; being converted into a different uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to compel punctual payment of the money lent. The penalty accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly is due at common law if the covenanted term be allowed to elapſe without payment: and this penal ſtipulation is in the practice of England governed by the rule of equity above laid down: <q rend="inline">"After the day of payment the double ſum becomes the legal debt; and there is no remedy againſt ſuch penalty but by application to a court of equity, which relieves on payment of principal, intereſt, and coſts <note n="†" place="bottom">New abridg. of the law, vol. 3. p. 691.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In our bonds for payment of money, a clauſe generally is added binding the debtor <q rend="inline">"to pay a fifth part more of liquidate expences in caſe of failzie."</q> This clauſe is commonly treated as intending a penalty of the kind laſt mentioned, contrived to inforce perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: but I think improperly; for the words plainly import a liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that damage which the creditor may ſuſtain by the debtor's
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0743600300:289"/>
failing to pay at the term covenanted. It is of the nature of a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action <hi>de re futura,</hi> being a lump ſum in place of all that can be demanded in caſe of future damage by the ſaid failure. Lord Stair, talking of the court of ſeſſion as a court of equity, conſiders the clauſe in the foregoing light: <q rend="inline">"The court of ſeſſion (ſays our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) modifies exorbitant penalties in bonds and contracts, even though they bear the name of liquidate expences with conſent of parties, which neceſſitous debtors yield to. Theſe the Lords retrench to the real expence and damage of the parties. Yet theſe clauſes have this effect, that the Lords take ſlender proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true expence, and do not conſider whether it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or not, provided it exceed not the ſum agreed on; whereas in other caſes they allow no expence but what is neceſſary or profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note n="*" place="bottom">lib. 4. tit. 3. § 1.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Conſidering the foregoing clauſe as a tranſaction <hi>de re futura,</hi> it may be doubted, whether in any caſe it ought to be mitigated. On the one hand, whatever be the extent of the damage, the creditor by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement can demand no more but the liquidated ſum; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on the other, it may be thought that he is intitled to this ſum even where it exceeds his damage: <hi>Cujus incommodum, ejus debet eſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum.</hi> This argument is concluſive, ſuppoſing the tranſaction fair and equal, ſtipulating no greater ſum than the damages ordinarily amount to. But it ought to be conſidered, that formerly money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenders in Scotland were in condition to give law to thoſe who bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Hence exorbitant ſums as liquidate expences, which, being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and oppreſſive, ought to be mitigated in equity. Upon that account, the lump ſum for damages has been generally conſidered as a penalty; which in effect it is when exorbitant, and as ſuch it ſhall hereafter be treated of.</p>
               <p>The only doubtful point touching this penalty, is to determine at what time and by what means it is incurred. If we adhere to the words of the clauſe, it is incurred by <hi>failzie</hi> in general, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by every ſort of failzie. But many good lawyers, moved with the hardſhip of ſubjecting an innocent perſon to a penalty, hold, that the penalty is not incurred except in the caſe of culpable failzie, and that this muſt be underſtood the meaning of the clauſe. They maintain accordingly, that when a debtor, in place of payment, enters into a law-ſuit, he is not liable for any part of the penalty, though reſtricted to the coſts of ſuit, if he have <hi>probabilis cauſa litigandi.</hi> They do not advert, as above laid down, that a conventional penalty reſtricted to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0743600300:290"/>
the expence of execution or coſts of ſuit, ceaſes in that caſe to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and that the creditor, when ſuch claim is made effectual to him, draws nothing but what he hath actually expended. But as this is a point of great importance in practice, it merits a deliberate diſcuſſion; to which I proceed.</p>
               <p>In order to give ſatisfaction upon this ſubject, I muſt ſtate a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary point, <hi>viz.</hi> What claim there is for coſts of ſuit abſtracting from a conventional penalty. A man who oppoſes a juſt claim, acts againſt law: but is he therefore bound to repair the damage he occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the purſuer? If he be litigious in any degree, he is bound; for though it may require a crime to ſubject a man to puniſhment, the ſlighteſt voluntary wrong or fault is a ſufficient foundation for damages, even at common law. But it is a rule in municipal law, derived from the law of nature, <q rend="inline">"That a man free from fault or blame is not liable to repair any hurt he occaſions <note n="*" place="bottom">See the chapter immediately foregoing.</note>;"</q> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no foundation even at common law for ſubjecting to the coſts of ſuit, or to any damage, a defendant who is <hi>in bona fide.</hi> Equity is ſtill more averſe from making an innocent perſon in any caſe liable to damages; for, conſidering that man is a fallible being, his caſe would be deplorable were he bound to repair all the loſs he may occaſion by an involuntary wrong. What then ſhall we ſay of the act 144. parl. 1592, appointing, <q rend="inline">"That damage, intereſt, and expences of plea, be admitted by all judges, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidated in the decree, whether condemnator or abſolvitor?"</q> If this regulation could ever be juſt, it muſt have been among a plain people, governed by a few ſimple rules of law, ſuppoſed to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known. Law, in its preſent ſtate, is too intricate to admit a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that every perſon who goes againſt it is <hi>in mala fide;</hi> and yet, unleſs <hi>mala fides</hi> be preſumed in every caſe, the regulation cannot be juſtified.</p>
               <p>Taking it now for granted, that, abſtracting from a paction, coſts of ſuit cannot be claimed, otherwiſe than upon the medium of liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioſity, I proceed in my inquiry. And I begin with examining, whether it be lawful to ſtipulate damages upon the obligor's failure to perform, not even excepting an innocent failure. To bring this queſtion near the eye, I put a plain caſe. A man is willing to lend his money at common intereſt: but inſiſts, that if he be put to any expence in recovering payment, the borrower, who occaſions this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, ſhall be liable for it; and the borrower agrees to take the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0743600300:291"/>
upon that condition. Is this paction one of thoſe oppreſſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, againſt which the debtor will be relieved in equity? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover any injuſtice in the paction, nor any oppreſſion. A pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this nature, ſo far from being unjuſt or oppreſſive, appears to be a natural conſequence from the law againſt uſury. Where a man is permitted to take what intereſt he can for his money, a high intereſt may be held ſufficient to counterbalance what may be expended in recovering payment: but where the creditor is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to a certain rate of intereſt, it ſeems intended by the legiſlature, that he ſhould in all events be ſecure of that intereſt, without being forc'd to expend it, and perhaps more, upon recovering the very ſum he lent. Where-ever this happens, the creditor, inſtead of the common rate of intereſt, receives no intereſt at all; and muſt be ſatisfied to receive back a ſum, that, in effect, has all along been barren.</p>
               <p>An inquiry here into what is lawful, ſmooths the road in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent progreſs. If the paction above mentioned be lawful, we cannot heſitate in preſuming that every creditor will take advantage of it; and conſequently, that this paction muſt be implied in the penal clauſe contained in our bonds of borrowed money. To confine the meaning of this penal clauſe to a culpable failure, is truly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the effect of it altogether; for a culpable failure ſubjects the debtor to damages at common law, independent of the clauſe. Nor can we doubt that the meaning of the clauſe is as above ſet forth, when we ſee the ſame meaning given to a penal clauſe in England and in old Rome.</p>
               <p>That the penalty in our bonds of borrowed money is incurred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by an innocent failure, appears, not only from the preſumed will of the parties, but alſo from the inveterate practice of the court of ſeſſion in mitigating theſe penalties, which would be againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſuppoſing the failure to be criminal or culpable. I urge, in the next place, that the failure of a debtor to pay at the term cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted, muſt <hi>in dubio</hi> be held innocent till the contrary be proved. This is a legal privilege, common to a debtor with the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Hence it neceſſarily follows, that if the clauſe under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be confined to culpable failure, a charge of horning cannot paſs for the penalty, till it be proved in a proceſs, that the failure is culpable. Here is a vexing dilemma: if culpable failure be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the clauſe, the practice of charging for the penalty as ſoon as the term of payment is paſt, muſt be given up as irregular and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, though acquieſced in for centuries without the leaſt oppoſition:
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0743600300:292"/>
on the other hand, if it be admitted, as it muſt be, that this practice is agreeable to law, it follows neceſſarily, that a conventional penalty is incurred by innocent as well as by culpable failure.</p>
               <p>Add the following obſervation. Where a bond ſtipulating intereſt after the term of payment is ſuſpended, and the letters found order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeded, after an intricate and doubtful litigation of many years, no lawyer ever dreamed that the ſuſpender's <hi>bona fides</hi> will relieve him from intereſt. And yet it will puzzle the ableſt lawyer to ſay, where the difference lies in this caſe between intereſt and coſts of ſuit: if a plauſible defence prevent the ſtipulated penalty from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, it ought alſo to prevent the ſtipulated intereſt from being incurred. Both are due <hi>ex contractu</hi> upon the failure of payment; and if there be any reaſon for barring innocent failure in the paction for the penalty, there is the ſame reaſon for barring it in the paction for intereſt. If there be a difference, the penalty reſtricted to coſts of ſuit is the more favourable claim: it is money out of the creditor's pocket; it is <hi>damnum datum;</hi> whereas the claim for intereſt is only <hi>lucrum ceſſans.</hi> With reſpect to the Engliſh double bond, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludes beyond the poſſibility of cavil; the penal ſtipulation being the only foundation for claiming intereſt, as well as for claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coſts.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, it ſhall now be taken for granted, that in a bond of borrowed money the penal ſum is incurred by innocent as well as by culpable failure. In the latter caſe, ſuppoſing the <hi>culpa</hi> clearly proved, equity pleads not for a mitigation: in the former, equity requires a mitigation, as far as the ſtipulation is truly penal; that is, as far as the penal ſum exceeds the damage occaſioned to the creditor by the delay of payment. This mitigation ariſes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily from the rule above mentioned, <q rend="inline">"He that demands equity muſt give equity."</q> And hence, in innocent failure, the practice is to mitigate the penalty to the coſts of ſuit, and to what other damage is clearly aſcertained. This, at the ſame time, by putting the creditor in the ſame condition as if punctual payment had been made, fulfils all the intention he could fairly have in ſtipulating a penalty.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. What effect, with reſpect to heirs, has the death of the obligee or legatee before or after the term of payment?</head>
               <p>IF the obligee's heirs be named in the obligation, they will ſucceed whether he die before or after the term of payment, becauſe ſuch is the will of parties. The preſent queſtion relates to obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where the obligee's heirs are not named. Such obligations by the common law tranſmit not to heirs; becauſe the common law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards what is ſaid to be the only proof of will: but equity is not ſo peremptory nor ſuperficial. It conſiders, that in human affairs er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and omiſſions are frequent, and that words are not always to be abſolutely relied on: it holds indeed words to be the beſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of will, but not to be the only evidence. If therefore any ſuſpicion lie, that the will is not preciſely what is expreſſed, every rational circumſtance is laid hold of to aſcertain, with all the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy poſſible, what really was the will of the granter, or of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracters <note n="*" place="bottom">See p. 122.</note>.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to this point, the cauſe of the obligation is one capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal circumſtance. A gratuitous obligation has no cauſe but the will merely of the granter; and therefore an heir cannot claim upon ſuch obligation, unleſs he can ſhow the will of the granter to be in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; which will be no eaſy taſk if he be not named in the deed. Thus a gratuitous promiſe to give a ſum to Titius at a day certain, without mentioning heirs, will be ineffectual if Titius die before the term of payment: the heir of Titius has no claim either at common law or in equity.</p>
               <p>But what if Titius, ſurviving the term, die without obtaining payment? His heir has no claim at common law, becauſe he is not named in the obligation; but he has a good claim in equity: with reſpect to the obligor, it being his duty to make payment at the term ſtipulated, juſtice will not ſuffer him to make profit by his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy or neglect: with reſpect to the obligee, being intitled to the ſum at the term ſtipulated, he muſt not be forfeited by the failure of the obligor. Equity therefore affords an action to his heir for payment,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0743600300:294"/>
which relieves from the loſs ſuſtained at common law by the failure of payment.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, an obligation for a valuable conſideration is in its nature perpetual, and ought in all events to be fulfilled. Such muſt be preſumed the intention of parties, in every engagement that is not purely an exerciſe of benevolence. An obligor accordingly who has received a valuable conſideration, muſt, in all events, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his part of the engagement, unleſs the contrary be ſtipulated: the obligee's death, in particular, before the term of payment, will not relieve the obligor, though the obligee's heirs be not named in the deed. The common law, it is true, affords not to the heir an action in this caſe more than where the obligation is gratuitous: but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſupplying the defects of common law, affords an action, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to fulfil the rules of juſtice, which will not ſuffer the valuable conſideration to remain with the obligor without performing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent pactioned. Hence, with reſpect to the point under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, an obligation for a valuable conſideration is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to that which is gratuitous. In the former, the heir takes unleſs he be expreſsly excluded: in the latter, the heir takes not unleſs he be expreſsly included. Thus a bond for borrowed money, though taken in the creditor's name ſolely, will go to his heir, even where he dies before the term of payment.</p>
               <p>Men are bound to educate their children till they be able to gain a livelihood for themſelves; and any further proviſion is underſtood to be gratuitous. Hence a bond of proviſion to children is deemed a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous deed; and for that reaſon, if the children die before the term of payment, equity gives no aid to their heirs. If heirs be named in the bond, they have right at common law: if not named, neither equity nor common law gives them right. Thus, in a contract of marriage certain proviſions being allotted to the children, the portions of the males payable at their age of twenty-one years, and of the females at eighteen, without mentioning heirs or aſſignees; the aſſignees and creditors of ſome of the children who died before the term of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were judged to have no right <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, January 17. 1665, Edgar contra Edgar.</note>. I cannot ſo readily acquieſce in the following deciſion, where a bond of proviſion payable to a daughter at her age of fourteen, and to her heirs executors and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignees, was voided by her death before the term of payment <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, February 22. 1677, Belſches contra Belſches.</note>. The addition of <hi>heirs executors and aſſignees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> was thought to regard the child's death after the term of payment; and not to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0743600300:295"/>
of the granter's will that the bond ſhould be effectual though the child died before the term of payment. The clauſe, I admit, is capable of that reſtricted meaning: but I can find no cauſe for this reſtriction; and in all caſes it is ſafeſt to give words their natural import, unleſs it be made extremely clear that the granter's meaning was different. And accordingly Chalmers having ſettled his eſtate upon his nephew, with the burden of a ſum certain to Iſabel Inglis, wife of David Millar, and to her heirs executors, or aſſignees, payable year and day after his death, with intereſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the term of payment; and Iſabel having died before Chalmers, leaving a ſon who ſurvived him; the ſum was decreed to that ſon as a conditional inſtitute <note n="*" place="bottom">Millar contra Inglis, July 16. 1760.</note>.</p>
               <p>Even a bond of proviſion, or any gratuitous deed, will deſcend to heirs, as above ſaid, if ſuch was the granter's intention. Nor is it neceſſary in equity that ſuch intention be expreſſed in words: it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that it be made evident from circumſtances.</p>
               <p>What is ſaid above ſeems a more clear and concluſive reaſon for excluding heirs where the creditor in a bond of proviſion dies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the term of payment, than what is commonly aſſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſum in the bond, being deſtined as a ſtock for the child, ceaſes to be due, ſince it cannot anſwer the purpoſe for which it was intended. Were this reaſon good, it would hold equally whether the child die before or after the term of payment; and therefore in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too much it proves nothing.</p>
               <p>In what caſes a legatee tranſmits a legacy to his heirs, is a queſtion that takes in a great variety of matter. To have a diſtinct notion of this queſtion, legacies muſt be divided into their different kinds. I begin with the legacy of a <hi>corpus.</hi> The property here is transferred to the legatee <hi>ipſo jure</hi> upon the teſtator's death. The reaſon is, that will ſolely muſt in this caſe have the effect to transfer property, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it could never be transferred from the dead to the living: a proprietor after his death cannot make delivery; and no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but the proprietor can make a legal delivery. Now if the legatee be veſted in the property of the ſubject legated, it muſt upon his death deſcend to his heirs even by common law.</p>
               <p>But what if the legatee die before the teſtator? In this caſe the legacy is void. The teſtator remains proprietor till his death, and the ſubject legated cannot by his death be transferred to a perſon who is no longer in exiſtence. Nor can it be transferred to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0743600300:296"/>
heirs, becauſe the teſtator did not exert any act of will in their favour.</p>
               <p>The next caſe I put is of a ſum of money legated to Titius. A le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy of this ſort, giving the legatee an intereſt in the teſtator's perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate, and intitling him to a proportion, veſts in the legatee <hi>ipſo jure</hi> upon the teſtator's death. And for the ſame reaſon that is given above, the legacy even at common law will tranſmit to heirs, if the legatee ſurvive the teſtator; if not, it will be void. But what if the legacy be ordered to be paid at a certain term? It muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether the term be added for the benefit of the teſtator's heir, in order to give him time for preparing the money; or whether it be added as a limitation upon the legacy. A term for payment given to the teſtator's heir, will not alter the nature of the legacy, nor prevent its veſting in the legatee upon the teſtator's death; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſuch a legacy will tranſmit to heirs, even where the legatee dies before the term of payment, provided he ſurvive the teſtator. <hi>Dies cedit etſi non venerit.</hi> But where the purpoſe of naming a term for payment is to limit the legacy, the legatee's death before that term will bar his heirs, becauſe he himſelf had never any right. Here <hi>dies nec cedit nec venit.</hi> In order to aſcertain the intention of the teſtator in naming a day for payment, the rule laid down by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinian is judicious: <hi>Dies incertus conditionem in teſtamento facit</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 75. De condition. et demon.</note>. A day certain for performance is commonly added in favour of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator's heir, in order to give him time for providing the money. An uncertain term reſpects generally the condition of the legatee, as where a legacy is in favour of a boy to be claimed when he arrives at eighteen years of age, or of a girl to be claimed at her marriage: in ſuch inſtances, it appears to be the will of the teſtator, that the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall not veſt before the term of payment. The <hi>dies incertus</hi> is ſaid to make the legacy conditional; not properly ſpeaking, for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a day of payment, certain or uncertain, is not a condition. But as the uncertain term for payment has the effect to limit the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy in the ſame manner as if it were conditional; for that reaſon, the uncertain term is ſaid to imply a condition, or to make the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy conditional.</p>
               <p>A third ſort of legacy is where the teſtator burdens his heir to pay a certain ſum to Titius ſingly, without the addition of heirs. The heirs, by the common law, have no right even where Titius ſurvives the teſtator, becauſe there is not here, as in the former caſes, any
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0743600300:297"/>
ſubject veſted in Titius to deſcend of courſe to his heirs; not can heirs, by the common law, claim upon an obligation which is not in their favour. But equity ſuſtains an action to them: for no day being named, the death of the teſtator is the term of payment; and equity will not ſuffer the teſtator's heir to profit by delaying payment. Where a term of payment is added by the teſtator, the caſe becomes the ſame with that of a gratuitous obligation <hi>inter vivos.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Arreſtment and proceſs of forthcoming.</head>
               <p>THOUGH a creditor cannot be forc'd to receive any ſubject for payment of his debt other than current ſpecie; yet ſometimes he agrees to take ſatisfaction in goods; and ſometimes, for want of ready money, he is put off with a ſecurity, an aſſignment to rents, for example, or to debts, which impowers him to draw his payment out of theſe funds belonging to his debtor. Legal execution, copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a creditor's private acts, is clearly diſtinguiſhable into three kinds. The firſt, by forcing payment of the debt, reſembles as to its effect voluntary payment. This was the caſe of poinding as framed originally <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtorical law-tracts, tract 10.</note>: and is the caſe at preſent of a forthcoming of moveables, as will appear from the following analyſis. A debtor's moveables in his own poſſeſſion are attached by poinding, correſponding to the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari facies</hi> in England: but where theſe moveables are in cuſtody of any other, and the particulars unknown, there is no opportunity for poinding: they are attached by a proceſs of forthcoming againſt the cuſtodier or poſſeſſor; in which proceſs, the moveables attached are ſold by authority of the court, the price is delivered to the creditor for his payment, and the debt is thereby extinguiſhed in whole or in part.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reſembles voluntary acceptance of fungibles for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the debt; which is the caſe of poinding as modelled in our later practice. The goods are not ſold as originally, but only valued and delivered <hi>ipſa corpora</hi> to the creditor for ſatisfying the debt upon which the execution proceeds.</p>
               <p>The third reſembles a voluntary ſecurity; for it proceeds no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to give a ſecurity upon the debtor's funds, leaving the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0743600300:298"/>
to operate his payment by virtue of the ſecurity. This is the caſe of an adjudication during the legal, which impowers the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to draw his payment out of the debtor's rents, provided the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants be willing to pay: if refractory, they may be compelled by a decree againſt them perſonally for their rents. This decree, termed <hi>a decreet of mails and duties,</hi> completes the ſecurity, by giving direct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the debtor's tenants. A decree for making forthcoming ſums of money due to the debtor, is of the ſame nature; being a ſecurity only, not payment: and ſuch a decree may be juſtly defined a power given to the creditor to draw payment from the debtors of his debtor. What follows to complete the proceſs may be done by private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: the perſon againſt whom the decree of forthcoming is obtained ought to pay without further compulſion; and payment thus obtained voluntarily, extinguiſhes the debt upon which the forthcoming is founded. In a word, a decree of forthcoming obtained by my credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor againſt my debtor, reſembles in every circumſtance an order by me upon my debtor, to deliver the ſum he owes me to my creditor for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the debt I owe him: a decree of forthcoming is a judicial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, having the ſame effect with a voluntary order. Hence it clearly follows, that if my debtor, againſt whom the decree of forthcoming is obtained, prove inſolvent, the ſum is loſt to me, not to my credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: his ſecurity indeed is gone, but the debt which was ſecured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains entire.</p>
               <p>A judicial order to ſecure a moveable ſubject, whether a perſon or goods, till it be diſpoſed of by legal authority, is ſtyled, <hi>an arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Perſons accuſed of crimes are arreſted to prevent their flying or abſconding. When the property of moveables is diſputed, they are arreſted in the hands of the poſſeſſor till the property be aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This arreſtment, termed <hi>rei ſervandae cauſa,</hi> is a ſpecies of ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: it is a ſequeſtration in the hands of the poſſeſſor, inſtead of a ſequeſtration <hi>in manibus curiae.</hi> It hath its full effect, by ſecuring the controverted ſubject till the property be aſcertained; and when the property is aſcertained, the proprietor takes poſſeſſion <hi>via facti,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity of a proceſs of forthcoming. A third ſort of arreſtment is preparatory to a proceſs of forthcoming, raiſed by a creditor for drawing his payment out of his debtor's moveable funds; and this ſort only is propoſed to be handled in the preſent chapter.</p>
               <p>When a creditor ſuſpects that his debtor has goods not in his own poſſeſſion, he obtains a warrant or order from a proper court to arreſt them in the hands of the cuſtodier; and this order ſerved upon the cuſtodier, makes him anſwerable for theſe goods, when they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0743600300:299"/>
by the creditor in a proceſs of forthcoming. The ſervice of this order is termed <hi>an arreſtment,</hi> and the perſon upon whom it is ſerved is termed <hi>the arreſtee.</hi> Sums due to the debtor may be arreſted in the ſame manner. An arreſtment of this kind is not, properly ſpeaking, a ſtep of execution; for goods or debts may be made forthcoming for ſatisfying the creditor without uſing an arreſtment: it is only a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory ſtep uſed by a cautious creditor, for ſecuring the ſubject in the hands of the arreſtee till a proceſs of forthcoming be raiſed. In this reſpect, an arreſtment is preciſely ſimilar to an inhibition, which, properly ſpeaking, is not a ſtep of execution, but only an injunction to the debtor, prohibiting him to alien his land, or to contract debt; and the effect of this prohibition is to preſerve the fund entire to the creditor when he proceeds to adjudge. Adjudications are carried on every day without a preparatory inhibition; and in the ſame manner may a proceſs of forthcoming be carried on without a preparatory ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtment.</p>
               <p>Theſe things ſhortly premiſed, I come to what is chiefly intended in this chapter, which is to explain the operations of common law and of equity with reſpect to an arreſtment, when it is brought in competition with other rights voluntary or legal. All writers are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed about the effect given by common law to an arreſtment of moveable goods; which being, as above obſerved, a ſequeſtration in the hands of the poſſeſſor, transfers not the property to the creditor. The goods ſecured by the arreſtment are, in the proceſs of forthco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſold as the property of the debtor, and the price is applied for payment of the debt due by him to his creditor the arreſter. For this reaſon, an arreſtment cannot bar a poinding carried on by another creditor: the common law, authoriſing execution, conſiders only whether the ſubject propoſed to be attached belong to the debtor; and if it be his property, execution proceeds of courſe.</p>
               <p>The effect of an arreſtment attaching ſums of money due to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſter's debtor, has been much controverted; and in order to clear that point, it becomes neceſſary to take an accurate ſurvey of ſuch arreſtment in all its parts. The letter or warrant for arreſtment, to which the arreſtment itſelf is entirely conformable, is in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words: <q rend="inline">"To fence and arreſt all and ſundry the ſaid A. B. his readieſt goods, gear, debts, &amp;c. in whoſoever hands the ſame can be apprehended, to remain under ſure fence and arreſtment, at the inſtance of the ſaid complainer, ay and while payment be made to him."</q> Upon this warrant, and arreſtment following upon it, it will be obſerved, firſt, That no perſon is named but the arreſter and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0743600300:300"/>
his debtor. It is not a limited warrant to arreſt in the hands of any particular perſon; but authoriſes the creditor to arreſt in the hands of any perſon that he ſuſpects may owe money to his debtor. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The arreſtee is not ordered or authoriſed to make payment to the arreſter: the order he receives, is to keep the money in his hand till the arreſter be ſatisfied. Theſe particulars make it plain, that an arreſtment, like an inhibition, is merely prohibitory; and that it transfers not any right to the arreſter, which would be a poſitive ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And this point is put out of doubt by the ſummons of forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, concluding, <q rend="inline">"That the defender ſhould be decerned and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to make forthcoming to the complainer the ſum of reſting and owing by him to A. B. (the complainer's debtor againſt whom the execution paſſes), and arreſted in the defender's hands at the complainer's inſtance."</q> A decree of forthcoming, therefore, as above obſerved, is a ſpecies of execution, intitling the creditor to draw his payment out of ſums due to his debtor. It is the decree of forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming that gives a ſecurity to the creditor upon the ſum arreſted due to his debtor; and the preparatory arreſtment has no other effect, but to afford an interim ſecurity to prevent alienation before the proceſs of forthcoming be raiſed.</p>
               <p>If it hold true, that arreſtment is prohibitory only, and that my creditor arreſting in the hands of my debtor, hath no right to the ſum arreſted till he obtain a decree of forthcoming; it follows upon the principles of common law, that this ſum, belonging to me after arreſtment as well as before, lies open to be attached by my other creditors; and that, in a competition among theſe creditors, all of them arreſters, the firſt decree of forthcoming muſt give preference. For the firſt order ſerved upon my debtor binds him to the creditor who obtained the order; after which he cannot legally pay to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus ſtands the common law, which is followed out in a courſe of deciſions, moſtly of an old date, giving preference, not to the firſt arreſtment, but to the firſt decree of forthcoming.</p>
               <p>Whether equity make any variation ſhall be our next inquiry. It is the privilege of a debtor, with reſpect to his own funds, to chuſe what of them he will apply for payment of his debts. Upon the debtor's failure, this choice is transferred to the creditor, who may attach any particular ſubject for his payment. In that caſe, the debtor is in duty bound to ſurrender to his creditor the ſubject attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by conveying it to him for his ſecurity. It is undoubtedly the duty of the debtor to relieve his creditor from the trouble and expence of execution; and, conſequently, to relieve him from execution againſt
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0743600300:301"/>
any particular ſubject, by ſurrendering it voluntarily, unleſs he find other means of making payment. The creditor's privilege to attach any particular ſubject for his payment, and the debtor's relative obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to ſave execution by ſurrendering that ſubject to his creditor, are indeed the foundation of all execution. A judge authoriſing exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ſupplies only the place of the debtor; and conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not authoriſe execution againſt any particular ſubject, unleſs the debtor be antecedently bound to ſurrender the ſame to his creditor <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 221.</note>. This branch of the debtor's duty explains clearly a rule in law, <q rend="inline">"That inchoated execution makes the ſubject litigious, and ties up the debtor's hands from aliening."</q> If it be his duty to prevent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſurrendering this ſubject to his creditor, it is inconſiſtent with his duty to diſpoſe of it for any other purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In applying the rules of equity to an arreſtment, the duty now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded will be found of importance. If the debtor ought to convey to his creditor the ſubject arreſted by him, no other creditor who knows the debtor to be ſo bound, can juſtly attach that ſubject by legal execution: for it is unjuſt to demand from a debtor privately, or even by legal execution, any ſubject that he is bound to convey to another <note n="†" place="bottom">ibid.</note>. And if a creditor ſhall act thus unjuſtly, by arreſting a ſubject which he knows to be already arreſted by another creditor, a court of equity will diſappoint the effect of the ſecond arreſtment, by giving preference to the firſt.</p>
               <p>Our writers, though they have not clearly unfolded the foregoing obligation which the debtor is under to the firſt arreſter, have, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, been ſenſible of it; for it is obviouſly with reference to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, that an arreſtment is ſaid to make a <hi>nexus realis</hi> upon the ſubject. I know but of two ways by which a man can be connected with a debt: one is where he has the <hi>jus exigendi,</hi> and one where the creditor is bound to make it over to him. It will be admitted, that an arreſtment has not the effect of transferring to the arreſter the debt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted: the arreſter has not even the <hi>jus exigendi</hi> till he obtain a decree of forthcoming. And if ſo, a <hi>nexus realis,</hi> applied to the preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, cannot import other than the obligation which the creditor is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make over the debt to the arreſter. Thus, by the principles of equity, the firſt arreſtment is preferable while the ſubject is <hi>in medio;</hi> but if a poſterior arreſter, without notice of a former, obtain payment upon a decree of forthcoming, he is ſecure in equity, as well as at common law; and his diſcovery afterward of a prior arreſtment will not oblige him to repay the money <note n="‡" place="bottom">p. 224.</note>. This equitable rule of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0743600300:302"/>
is accordingly eſtabliſhed at preſent, and all the late deciſions of the court of ſeſſion proceed upon it.</p>
               <p>An arreſtment, as obſerved above, hath not the effect at common law to bar poinding; but in equity, for the reaſon now given, an arreſtment made known to the poinder, ought to bar him from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in his execution, as well as it bars a poſterior arreſtment. A creditor ought not, by any ſort of execution, to force from his debtor what the debtor cannot honeſtly convey to him. And yet, though in ranking arreſtments the court of ſeſſion follows the rules of equity, it acts as a court of common law in permitting a ſubject to be poind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after it is arreſted by another creditor. I ſhall cloſe this branch of my ſubject with a general obſervation, That the equitable rules eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed above, hold only where the debtor is ſolvent: it will be ſeen afterward, that in the caſe of bankruptcy, all perſonal creditors ought to draw equally.</p>
               <p>So much about arreſters competing for the ſame debt. Next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an arreſter competing with an aſſignce for a valuable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Touching this competition, one preliminary point muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately adjuſted, <hi>viz.</hi> How far an arreſtment makes the ſubject ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted litigious; or, in other words, How far it bars voluntary deeds. It is obvious, in the firſt place, that an arreſtment makes the ſubject litigious with reſpect to the arreſtee, becauſe it is ſerved upon him: the very purpoſe of the arreſtment is, to prohibit him from making payment, or from giving up the goods of which he is cuſtodier. In the next place, As a creditor may proceed to arreſtment without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating his purpoſe to his debtor, an arreſtment cannot bar the debtor's voluntary deeds, till it be notified to him: the arreſtment deprives him not of his <hi>jus crediti,</hi> nor of his property; and while he continues ignorant of the arreſtment, nothing bars him, either in law or in equity, from conveying his right to a third party. Upon that account, intimation to him is an eſtabliſhed practice in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from whence we borrowed an arreſtment: <q rend="inline">"Quamvis debitor debitoris mei a me arreſtari nequeat, cum mihi nulla ex cauſa obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatus ſit, tamen, quod Titius debitori meo debet, per judicem inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere poſſum, ne debitori meo ſolvatur, ſine mea vel judicis volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.

The cedent aliens indeed <hi>mala fide</hi> after the arreſtment is notified to him; but the purchaſer is ſecure if he be <hi>in bona fide:</hi> the property is legally transferred to him; and there is nothing in law nor in equity to deprive a man of a ſubject honeſtly acquired. That an arreſtment makes not the ſubject litigious with regard to third parties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will be clear from conſidering, that an effect ſo ſtrong is never given to any act, unleſs there be a public notification: a proceſs in the court of ſeſſion is ſuppoſed to be known to all; and, as it is a rule <hi>Quod nihil innovandum pendente lite,</hi> any perſon who tranſacts either with the plaintiff or defendant, ſo as to hurt the other, does knowingly an unlawful act, which for that reaſon will be voided: an inhibition and interdiction are publiſhed to all the lieges, who are thereby put <hi>in mala fide</hi> to purchaſe from the perſon inhibited or interdicted: an appriſing renders the ſubject litigious as to all, becauſe the letters are publicly proclaimed or denounced, not only upon the land, but alſo at the market-croſs of the head-borough of the juriſdiction where the land lies <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, lib. 3. tit. 2. § 14.</note>; and an adjudication has the ſame effect, becauſe it is a proceſs in the court of ſeſſion: a charge of horning bars not the debtor from aliening, till he be publicly proclaimed or denounced rebel; and it muſt be evident, that an arreſtment ſerved againſt my debtor cannot hurt third parties dealing with me, more than a horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt myſelf. In a word, litigioſity, ſo as to affect third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, never takes place without public notification.</p>
               <p>When one conſiders an inhibition, it will occur, that the argument here may be carried a great way farther; even ſo far as that the actual knowledge of an arreſtment ſhould not bar any perſon from purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſubject arreſted. But the argument from an inhibition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not with reſpect to an arreſtment; and in order to ſhow the difference, it will be neceſſary to ſtate the nature of an inhibition in a hiſtorical view.</p>
               <p>This writ prohibits the alienation of moveable as well as of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable ſubjects; and to ſecure againſt ſuch alienation, the writ is publiſhed to the lieges, to put every man upon his guard againſt
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0743600300:304"/>
dealing with the perſon inhibited. This writ muſt have been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a frugal age, before the commerce of money was far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and before inhibitions were frequent. While inhibitions were rare, their publication could be kept in remembrance; a debtor inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited would be a remarkable perſon, and every one would avoid deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him: but when the commerce of money was farther extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and debts were multiplied, an inhibition was no longer a mark of diſtinction. And as inhibitions could no longer be kept in memory, they became a load upon the commerce of moveables paſt all enduring; for no man was in ſafety to purchaſe from his neighbour a horſe, or a buſhel of corn, till firſt the records of inhibitions were conſulted. A Lycurgus intending to bar commerce, in order to preſerve his nation in poverty, could not have invented a more effectual ſcheme. But this execution, inconſiſtent with commerce ſo far as it affects move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, is alſo inconſiſtent in itſelf, tending in a moſt direct manner to diſappoint its own end. The purpoſe of an inhibition is to force pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the effect of it is to prevent payment, by locking up the debtor's moveables, which commonly are the only ready fund for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing money.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons have prevailed upon the court of ſeſſion to deny any effect to an inhibition, ſo far as it regards moveables. An inhibition indeed, with reſpect to its form and tenor, continues the ſame that it was originally; and accordingly every debtor inhibited is to this hour diſcharged to alien his moveables, not leſs peremptorily than to alien his land. This is an inconſiſtency that cannot be remedied but by the legiſlature; for the court of ſeſſion cannot alter a writ of the common law, more than it can alter any other branch of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law. But the court of ſeſſion, as a court of equity, can redreſs the rigor, injuſtice, or oppreſſion, of the common law: and though it hath no power to alter the ſtyle of an inhibition, it acts juſtly in denying any force to an inhibition ſo far as it affects moveables; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo far it is an oppreſſive and inconſiſtent execution. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as above hinted, may ſeem to apply to an arreſtment, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the knowledge of this execution ought not to bar any perſon from purchaſing the ſubject arreſted, whether it be a debt, or a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able properly ſo called. But this holds not in practice: and there is good reaſon for diſtinguiſhing, in this particular, an arreſtment from an inhibition: the latter prohibits, in general, the debtor to alien any of his moveables, and for that reaſon is highly rigorous and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: the former is of particular ſubjects only, nor doth it affect any
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0743600300:305"/>
moveables in the debtor's own poſſeſſion; and for that reaſon, the execution ſo limited is neither rigorous nor oppreſſive. An arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore, as to the ſubjects affected by it, is allowed in practice to have the full effect that is given it by the common law. But with reſpect to a third party, it has a more ample effect in equity than at common law: for though a man who <hi>bona fide</hi> purchaſes a ſubject ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, is ſecure in equity as well as at common law; yet a <hi>mala fide</hi> purchaſe, though effectual at common law, will undoubtedly be void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a court of equity.</p>
               <p>Having diſcuſſed preliminary points, we proceed to the ſubject pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the competition between an arreſter and an aſſignee. I begin with an arreſtment of a moveable bond, aſſign'd before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtment, but intimated after. The intimation by our law makes a complete conveyance of the bond into the perſon of the aſſignee, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which it is in vain to think of making the debt forthcoming to the arreſter for his payment: the very foundation of his claim is gone; for neither law nor equity will permit any ſubject to be taken in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that belongs not to the debtor. Many deciſions, it is true, prefer the arreſter; upon what medium, I cannot comprehend. Our deciſions, however, are far from being uniform upon this point. I give the following example. A aſſigns the rent of his land for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and payment of a debt due by him. A hath another creditor who afterward raiſes a proceſs of adjudication againſt the ſame land. The aſſignee intimating his right after the citation, but before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of adjudication, is preferred before the adjudger <note n="*" place="bottom">Durie, March 2. 1637, Smith contra Hepburn.</note>. An arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſurely makes not a ſtronger <hi>nexus</hi> upon the ſubject than is made by a citation upon a ſummons of adjudication; and if an aſſignment be preferred before the latter, it muſt alſo be preferred before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But I ſay more. Let it be ſuppoſed, that after the citation upon the ſummons of adjudication, but before intimation of the aſſignment, the mails and duties are arreſted by a third creditor. The decree of adjudication is preferred before the arreſtment <note n="†" place="bottom">Dalrymple, June 26. 1705, Stewart contra Stewart.</note>. If ſo, here is a circle abſolutely inextricable, an adjudication preferred before an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtment, that arreſtment before an aſſignment, and that aſſignment again before the adjudication. This proves demonſtrably that the aſſignee ought to be preferred before the arreſter as well as before the adjudger. The court went ſtill farther in preferring an aſſignee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an arreſter. An Engliſh aſſignment to this day is a procuratory <hi>in rem ſuam</hi> only, carrying the equitable right indeed, but not the legal right. And yet with reſpect to a bond due to Wilſon reſiding
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0743600300:306"/>
in England by the Earl of Rothes in Scotland, an Engliſh aſſignment by Wilſon of the ſaid bond was of itſelf, without intimation, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before an arreſtment ſerved afterward upon the Earl. The prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thus given was clearly founded on equity; becauſe the court of ſeſſion, as a court of equity, could not juſtly make forthcoming to a creditor of Wilſon for his payment, a ſubject that Wilſon had aliened for a valuable conſideration, and to which the purchaſer had the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table though not the legal right. But if this be a juſt deciſion, which it undoubtedly is, nothing can be more unjuſt, than to prefer an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtment before a Scotch aſſignment of a prior date, even after it is completed by intimation; for here the aſſignee has both the equitable and legal right.</p>
               <p>The next caſe I put, is where in a proceſs of forthcoming upon an arreſtment, an aſſignee appears with an aſſignment prior to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtment, but not intimated. I have already given my reaſon for preferring the aſſignee, as the court did with reſpect to an Engliſh aſſignment: and yet the ordinary practice is to prefer the arreſtment; which one will have no heſitation to believe, when an arreſtment is preferred even where the aſſignment is intimated.</p>
               <p>The preference due to the aſſignee is in this caſe ſo clear, that I am encouraged to carry the doctrine farther, by preferring an aſſignee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before a poinder, provided the aſſignee appear for his intereſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the poinding be completed. The poinder no doubt is preferable at common law, becauſe the aſſignment not being completed by inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the debtor continues ſtill proprietor. The aſſignee however has the equitable right, and juſtice will not permit goods that the debtor has aliened for a valuable conſideration to be attached by any of his creditors. The reſult will be different, where the poinding is completed, and the property of the goods transferred to the creditor, before the aſſignee appear. In this caſe the poinder is ſecure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man can be forfeited of his property who has committed no fault.</p>
               <p>I proceed to an aſſignment of a debt made after the arreſtment, and intimated before the competition. Suppoſing the aſſignee to be <hi>in bona fide,</hi> he is clearly preferable; for the intimation veſts in him the legal as well as equitable right, which bars abſolutely the cedent and his creditors: and this reaſon is good at common law to prefer the aſſignee, even ſuppoſing he had notice of the arreſtment before he took the aſſignment. But in equity the arreſter is preferable where the aſſignee is <hi>in mala fide,</hi> for the following reaſon. The debtor, after his ſubject is affected by an arreſtment, is bound in duty to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0743600300:307"/>
the ſubject to his creditor the arreſter: if he tranſgreſs this duty by conveying the ſubject to one who knows of the arreſtment, both are guilty of a moral wrong, which equity will redreſs by preferring the arreſter.</p>
               <p>Let us drop now the intimation, by putting the caſe, that, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of forthcoming at the inſtance of an arreſter, an aſſignee appears for his intereſt, craving preference upon an aſſignment bearing date af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the arreſtment, but before the citation in the proceſs of forthco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Suppoſing the aſſignee <hi>in mala fide,</hi> he will in equity be poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to the arreſter for the reaſon immediately above given. But what ſhall be the rule of preference where the aſſignee purchaſes <hi>bona fide?</hi> The arreſter and he have each of them an equitable right to the ſubject; neither of them has the legal right. This caſe reſembles that of ſtellionate, where a proprietor of land ſells to two different purchaſers ignorant of each other: neither of whom has the legal right, becauſe there is no infeftment; but each of them has an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table right. In theſe caſes I cannot diſcover a rule for preference; nor can I extricate the matter otherwiſe than by dividing the ſubject between the competitors. And after all, whether this may not be cutting the Gordian knot inſtead of untying it, I pretend not to be certain.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, an arreſtment appears a very precarious ſecurity till a proceſs of forthcoming be commenced. This proceſs indeed is a notification to the debtor not to alien in prejudice of the arreſter, and at the ſame time a public notification to the lieges not to purchaſe the ſubject arreſted. And by this proceſs the ſubject is rendered liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, though the ſame privilege is not indulged to an inhibition ſo far as moveables are concerned.</p>

This branch of law is of great importance in every commercial country; and in order to ſet it in a clear light, I cannot think of a better arrangement than what follows. Firſt, To ſtate the rules of common law. Secondly, To examine what equity dictates. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To ſtate the regulations of different countries. And to conclude with the proceedings of the court of ſeſſion.</p>
               <p>The rules of common law are very ſhort, and indeed extremely imperfect. Any deed done by a bankrupt is effectual at common law, not leſs than if he were ſolvent. Nor is legal execution ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by bankruptcy; a creditor, after his debtor's bankruptcy, having the ſame remedy for recovering payment, that he had while his debtor was in entire credit. The reaſon is, that with reſpect to deed done by a bankrupt, and execution by his creditors, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law regards one circumſtance only, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the ſubject convey'd by the bankrupt, or attached by his creditors, was the bankrupt's property: if it was, a court of common law ſupports both. Hence it follows, that no fraud committed by a bankrupt againſt his creditors, can be regarded at common law. Let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the groſſeſt of all, that he ſecretes his moveables, and makes feigned alienations of his lands, in order to diſappoint his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: yet ſuch acts are conſidered as ſo many exertions of property, and conſequently legal.</p>
               <p>In order to determine with perſpicuity what juſtice or equity dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates in this caſe, it becomes neceſſary in the firſt place to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what circumſtances make bankruptcy in the common ſenſe of mankind. A man while he carries on trade, or hath any buſineſs that affords him a proſpect of gain, is not bankrupt though his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects may not be ſufficient to pay his debts: it is not unjuſt to pay one creditor before another, while there is a proſpect of making mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſatisfy all of them. But a man whoſe effects are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his debts, and who hath no proſpect of bettering his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, is in the common ſenſe of mankind inſolvent or bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: his creditors muſt loſe by him.</p>
               <p>This ſituation, though not uncommon, is yet ſingular in the eye of juſtice. <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>intereſt,</hi> for the moſt part ſtrictly united, are here disjoined: the bankrupt continues proprietor of his eſtate, but his creditors are the only perſons intereſted in it: they have the equitable right, and nothing remains with him but the legal right. Conſidering the matter in this light, a bankrupt may not improperly be held as a truſtee, bound to manage his effects for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof of his creditors: the duty of a bankrupt is in effect the ſame
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0743600300:309"/>
with that of a truſtee, as both of them ought to make a faithful account of the ſubjects under their management. While a debtor continues ſolvent, he may pay his creditors in what order he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe no creditor ſuffers by the preference given to another; but upon his bankruptcy or inſolvency, that privilege vaniſhes; he is bound to all his creditors equally, and juſtice dictates that he ought to diſtribute his effects among them equally. If a creditor in demanding payment from his debtors, or their cautioners bound conjunctly and ſeverally, ought to behave with impartiality <note n="*" place="bottom">See above, p. 110. 111.</note>, much more is this incumbent upon a bankrupt in making payment to his creditors. No diſtinction ought to be made but between real and perſonal creditors: a real ſecurity fairly obtained from a debtor in good circumſtances, is not prejudicial to the other creditors: ſuch a right, unexceptionable originally, cannot be voided by any accident that may afterward happen to the debtor; and therefore it is not tranſgreſſing the rule of impartiality for a bankrupt, in diſtributing his effects among his creditors, to prefer creditors of this ſort before others.</p>
               <p>If any heſitation remain about this doctrine after what has been ſaid, I appeal, for removing it, to the general ſenſe of this nation, vouched by act 5. parl. 1696, which, taking for granted that a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ought to behave with impartiality to his creditors, prohibits him to prefer any of his creditors before the reſt, and annulls every one of his deeds giving ſuch undue preference. And I may alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Engliſh bankrupt-ſtatutes, which evidently reſt upon the ſame foundation.</p>
               <p>Thus ſtands the duty of a bankrupt with reſpect to his creditors, founded on the rules of common juſtice. The duty of the creditors with reſpect to each other may ſeem not ſo evident. It is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of a creditor who obtains not ſatisfaction, to draw his pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the debtor's effects; and it will not readily occur, that the debtor's inſolvency, the very circumſtance which enhances the value of the privilege, ſhould be a bar to it. This way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is extremely natural, and hence the following maxims that have obtained an univerſal currency: <hi>Prior tempore potior jure: Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura ſubveniunt.</hi> In rude times, before the connections produced by ſociety have taken deep root, ſelfiſh principles prevail over thoſe that are ſocial. Thus in the preſent caſe, a creditor, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to his own intereſt, is apt to confine his thoughts to the power he hath over his debtor; overlooking, or ſeeing but obſcurely, that
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0743600300:310"/>
where the debtor is bankrupt, all the creditors are connected with each other by a common fund, the only ſubject of their payment. But by refinement of manners, the ſocial connections gain the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant: man becomes more a ſocial than a ſelfiſh being; and by the improvement of his rational as well as ſenſitive faculties, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the lawful authority of ſocial duties, as what he is bound to fulfil even in oppoſition to his own intereſt. By ſuch refinement it is at laſt perceived, that upon the debtor's inſolvency his perſonal creditors have all of them an equal claim upon his effects: that a creditor taking meaſures to operate his payment, ought to conſider the connection he has with his fellow-creditors engaged equally with him upon the ſame fund; and therefore that juſtice requires an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſtribution. In every view we take of the ſubject, we become more and more ſatisfied that this rule is agreeable to juſtice. To make the diſtribution of the common fund depend on priority of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, exhibits the appearance of a race, where the ſwifteſt obtains the prize: a race is a more manly competition, becauſe there is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in ſwiftneſs; whereas priority in execution depends upon acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent more frequently than upon expedition. It is natural for ſavage animals to fall out about their prey, and to rob each other; but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial beings ought to be governed by the principle of benevolence: creditors in particular, being connected by a common fund, and equally intereſted, ſhould not like enemies ſtrive to prevent each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but like near relations ſhould join in common meaſures for the common benefit.</p>
               <p>But to put this matter paſt doubt, I urge the following argument. A debtor, after his inſolvency, is bound to diſtribute his effects equally among his creditors; and it would be an act of injuſtice in him to prefer any of them before the reſt. It neceſſarily follows, that a creditor cannot be innocent, who, knowing the bankruptcy, takes more than his proportion of the effects: if he take more by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary payment, he is acceſſory to an unjuſt act done by the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; and it will not be thought that he can juſtly take more by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution than by voluntary payment. If he ſhould attempt ſuch wrong, it is the duty of the judge to refuſe execution <note n="*" place="bottom">See book 1. part 1. chap. 7. ſect. 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>That creditors having notice of their debtor's bankruptcy are barred from taking advantage of each other, ſeems now ſufficiently evident. It is a matter of greater intricacy, what effect bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ought to have againſt creditors who are ignorant of it. I begin with the caſe of payment made by a bankrupt in money or effects,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0743600300:311"/>
which transfers the property to his creditor. It is demonſtrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 232.</note>, that even in the caſe of ſtellionate, the ſecond purchaſer, ſuppoſing him <hi>in bona fide,</hi> and not partaker of his author's fraud, is ſecure by getting the firſt infeftment, and that his purchaſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cut down in equity more than at common law. The reaſoning there concludes with equal if not ſuperior force in the caſe of bankruptcy: it is unjuſt in a bankrupt to prefer one creditor before another; but if he offer payment, the creditor who accepts, ſuppoſing him ignorant of the bankruptcy, is innocent, and therefore ſecure: the property of the money or effects being transferred to him in lieu of his debt, there is no rule in equity more than at common law to forfeit him of his property. The ſame reaſoning concludes in favour of a creditor, who, ignorant of the bankruptcy, recovers payment by a poinding, or by a forthcoming upon an arreſtment.</p>
               <p>Next comes the caſe of a real ſecurity, the nature of which is, that it transfers not the property of the ſubject. It is obſerved above, that a real ſecurity obtained before bankruptcy is in all events a preferable debt. But what if it be obtained after bankruptcy? The creditor, who, ignorant of his debtor's bankruptcy, obtains from him ſuch ſecurity, whether by legal execution or by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary deed, is not culpable in any degree: at the ſame time, before this ſecurity exiſted, the equitable right to the bankrupt's effects was transferred to his creditors, who were intitled each of them to draw a ſhare in proportion to his juſt claim, ſuppoſing all of them at that period to have been perſonal creditors. This right eſtabliſhed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, cannot in equity be voided by legal execution; which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to force payment of what is juſtly due, and not to create a debt nor to enlarge it: far leſs can it be voided by the voluntary deed of the bankrupt, which as to him is an unjuſt act. Where a debt is actually extinguiſhed by payment, and the property of the money transferred, the court cannot interpoſe; for equity never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives an innocent man of his property. But where the creditor is ſtill <hi>in petitorio,</hi> the court juſtly refuſes to interpoſe in his behalf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his real ſecurity cannot be ſupported without forfeiting the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creditors of their equitable rights.</p>
               <p>If in a bankrupt it be unjuſt to divide his effects unequally among his creditors, it is ſtill more unjuſt to hurt his whole creditors by gratuitous alienations or gratuitous bonds. A gratuitous alienation transferring the property, cannot, it is true, be voided, if the donee
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0743600300:312"/>
be not in the knowledge of the bankruptcy: but he is liable to make good the value to the bankrupt's creditors, upon the rule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura;</hi> which is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to an alienation before bankruptcy, becauſe by ſuch an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the creditors are not hurt. But againſt a gratuitous bond claimed after bankruptcy, though executed and delivered while the granter was in good circumſtances, the rule <hi>Quod nemo debet locupleta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri aliena jactura</hi> is applicable; becauſe the taking payment is a direct prejudice to the creditors, who have given a valuable conſideration, by leſſening their fund; and for that reaſon a court of equity will not interpoſe to make ſuch a bond effectual. It deſerves attention, that this principle operates in favour of a creditor who lent his money even after the date of the gratuitous bond <note n="*" place="bottom">Dirleton, January 21. 1677, Ardblair contra Wilſon.</note>.</p>
               <p>The equitable right to the debtor's effects, which, upon his inſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, accrues to his creditors, makes it wrong in him to ſell any of his effects privately without their conſent. The ſale indeed is effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual at common law; but the purchaſer, ſuppoſing his knowledge of the bankruptcy, is acceſſory to the wrong, and the ſale is void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon that ground. The principle of utility alſo declares againſt a ſale of that nature: for to permit a bankrupt to alien his effects privately, even for a juſt price, is throwing a temptation in his way to defraud his creditors, by the opportunity he has to walk off with the money.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that in applying the rules of equity to the caſe of bankruptcy, two preliminary facts are of importance; firſt, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the bankruptcy; and, next, what knowledge creditors or others have of it: the former is neceſſary to be aſcertained in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very caſe; the latter frequently. The neceſſity of ſuch proof tends to darken and perplex law-ſuits concerning bankruptcy. To expiſcate even the commencement of bankruptcy, muſt always be difficult, conſidering that it depends on an internal act of the debtor's mind deeming his affairs irretrievable: and the difficulty is greatly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when the knowledge of the bankruptcy comes alſo to be a point at iſſue; for ſuch knowledge muſt be gathered commonly from a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of circumſtances, that are ſcarce ever the ſame in any two caſes. To avoid ſuch intricate expiſcation, which tends to make law-ſuits endleſs and judges arbitrary, it has been a great aim of the legiſlature in every commercial country, to ſpecify ſome ouvert act that ſhall be held not only the commencement of bankruptcy, but alſo a public notification of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0743600300:313"/>
But if the ſpecifying a legal mark of bankruptcy be of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, the choice of a proper act for ſuch a mark is not leſs nice than important. Whether in any country a choice altogether unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable has been made, ſeems doubtful. It ought, in the firſt place, to be ſome act that cannot readily happen except in bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: for to eſtabliſh as a mark of bankruptcy any act that may happen where there is no bankruptcy, may have pernicious conſequences, and be upon occaſion a heavy puniſhment without any guilt. Secondly, It muſt be ſuch an act as will readily happen in bankruptcy, and which a bankrupt cannot prevent: for if it be in his power to ſuppreſs it altogether, or for any time, he may in the interim do much wrong for which there can be no remedy.</p>
               <p>Having thus gone through the rules of the common law and the rules of equity concerning bankruptcy, we are, I preſume, ſufficiently prepared for the third article propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſtate the regulations of different countries upon that ſubject. And to bring the preſent article within reaſonable compaſs, I ſhall confine myſelf to the Roman law, the Engliſh law, and that of Scotland, which may be thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a ſpecimen. I begin with the Roman law. A debtor's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconding intitled his creditors to apply to the court for a <hi>curator bonis;</hi> and after the creditors were put in poſſeſſion by their <hi>curator,</hi> no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor could take payment from the bankrupt <note n="*" place="bottom">l. 6. § 7. Quae in fraud. cred. l. 10. § 16. eod.</note>. This <hi>miſſio in poſſeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> however, ſeems not to have been deemed a public notification of bankruptcy; for even after that period, a purchaſer from the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt was ſecure, if it could not be proved that he was <hi>particeps fraudis</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">l. 9. Quae in fraud. cred.</note>. But every gratuitous deed was reſcinded, whether the acquirer was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to the wrong or not <note n="‡" place="bottom">l. 6. § 11. eod.</note>; and in particular a gratuitous diſcharge of a debt <note n="‖" place="bottom">l. 1. § 2. eod.</note>.</p>
               <p>Before the <hi>miſſio in poſſeſſionem</hi> the debtor continued to have the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement as while he was ſolvent, and particularly was intitled to pay his creditors in what order he thought proper. It is accordingly laid down, That a creditor, who before the <hi>miſſio in poſſeſſionem</hi> receives pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ſecure, though he be in the knowledge of his debtor's inſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency. <hi>Sibi enim vigilavit,</hi> ſays the author <note n="**" place="bottom">l. 6. § 7. eod.</note>: a doctrine very juſt with reſpect to a court of common law, but very averſe to Praetorian law or principles of equity.</p>
               <p>The defects of the foregoing ſyſtem are many, but ſo obvious as to make a liſt unneceſſary. I ſhall mention two particulars only, being
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0743600300:314"/>
of great importance. The firſt is, that the neceſſity of eſtabliſhing a public mark of bankruptcy which every one is preſumed to know, ſeems to have been altogether overlooked by the Romans. Even the <hi>miſſio in poſſeſſionem,</hi> as mentioned above, was not held ſuch a mark. It is true, that after ſuch poſſeſſion no creditor could take payment from the bankrupt. But why? Not becauſe of the creditor's <hi>mala fides,</hi> but becauſe the creditors in general, being put in poſſeſſion of the bankrupt's funds, acquired thereby a <hi>jus pignoris,</hi> and in the diviſion of the price were accordingly intitled each of them to a rateable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. I obſerve next, that it is a great overſight in the Roman law, to neglect that remarkable period which runs between the firſt act of bankruptcy and the <hi>miſſio in poſſeſſionem.</hi> In that period generally all contrivances are ſet on foot to cover the effects of the bankrupt, or to prefer the favourite creditors.</p>
               <p>In England, the regulations concerning bankrupts are extended farther than in the Roman law, and are brought much nearer the rules of equity above laid down. The nomination of commiſſioners by the chancellor upon application of the creditors, is, in effect, the ſame with the nomination of a <hi>curator bonis</hi> in the Roman law. The foregoing defects of the Roman law are at the ſame time ſupplied, by declaring a debtor's abſconding or keeping out of the way, termed <hi>the firſt act of bankruptcy,</hi> to be a public mark or notification of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy, of which no perſon is ſuffered to plead ignorance. From that moment the hands both of the bankrupt and of his creditors are tied up: he can do no deed that is prejudicial to his creditors in general, or to any one in particular: they, on the other hand, are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to receive a voluntary payment, nor to operate their payment by legal execution.</p>
               <p>It is perhaps not eaſy to invent a regulation better calculated for fulfilling the rules of equity, than that now mentioned. It may be thought indeed, that the abſconding or keeping out of the way, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it momentary only, is a circumſtance too ſlight and too private to be impoſed upon all the world as notorious. But it ought to be conſidered, that the Engliſh bankrupt-ſtatutes are confined to mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile people, who live by buying and ſelling: and with reſpect to a merchant, his abſconding or keeping out of the way is a mark of bankruptcy neither ſlight nor obſcure. Merchants convene regularly in the exchange; a retailer ought to be found in his ſhop or ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; and their abſconding or abſence without a juſt cauſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. A perſon may happen, for ſome time, to be ignorant of the firſt act of bankruptcy; but a ſingular caſe muſt not be made an
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0743600300:315"/>
exception to a general rule: juſtice muſt be diſtributed by general rules; and it is better for ſociety that ſome individuals ſuffer than that judges become arbitrary and law-ſuits endleſs. There is indeed a hardſhip in this regulation with reſpect to commerce, which is ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a late ſtatute <note n="*" place="bottom">19. Geo. II. cap. 32.</note>, enacting, That money received from a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in the courſe of trade and dealing before the commiſſion of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy ſued forth, whether in payment of goods ſold to the bankrupt, or of a bill of exchange accepted by him, ſhall not be claimed by the aſſignees to the bankruptcy, unleſs it be made appear, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo receiving payment was in the knowledge of the debtor's bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy. This is in effect declaring with reſpect to payment received in the courſe of trade, that the iſſuing the commiſſion of bankruptcy is to be deemed the firſt public mark or notification of bankruptcy, and not what is called the firſt act of bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>The firſt bankrupt-act we have in Scotland is an act of ſederunt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by ſtatute 1621, cap. 18. intitled, <q rend="inline">"A ratification of the act of the Lords of Council and Seſſion againſt unlawful diſpoſitions and alienations made by dyvours and bankrupts."</q> In this act of ſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt two articles only are brought under conſideration. Firſt, Frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent contrivances to withdraw a bankrupt's effects from his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors by making ſimulate and feigned conveyances. Second, The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of bankrupts, by making payment to favourite creditors, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting others. With reſpect to the firſt, it is ſet forth in the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <q rend="inline">"That the fraud, malice, and falſehood of dyvours and bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts was become ſo frequent as to be in hazard of diſſolving all truſt and commerce among the ſubjects of this kingdom; that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by their apparent wealth in land and goods, and by their ſhow of conſcience and honeſty, having obtained credit, intend not to pay their debts, but either live riotouſly, or withdraw themſelves or their goods forth of this realm to elude all execution of juſtice: and to that effect, and in manifeſt defraud of their creditors, make ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate and fraudful alienations, diſpoſitions, and other ſecurities of their lands, reverſions, teinds, goods, actions, debts, and other ſubjects belonging to them, to their wives, children, kinſmen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and other confident and interpoſed perſons, without any true, lawful, or neceſſary cauſe, and without any juſt or true price; whereby the creditors and cautioners are falſely and godleſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of their juſt debts, and many honeſt families are ruined."</q> For remedying this evil,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ordained and declared, <q rend="inline">"Firſt, That all alienations, diſpoſitions, aſſignations, made by the debtor, of any
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0743600300:316"/>
of his lands, teinds, reverſions, actions, debts, or goods, to any conjunct or confident perſon, without true, juſt, and neceſſary cauſes, and without a juſt price really paid, ſhall be of no force or effect againſt prior creditors. Second, Whoever purchaſes from the ſaid interpoſed perſons any of the bankrupt's lands or goods, at a juſt price, or in ſatisfaction of debt, <hi>bona fide,</hi> without being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the fraud, ſhall be ſecure. Third, The receiver of the price ſhall make the ſame forthcoming to the bankrupt's creditors. Fourth, It ſhall be ſufficient evidence of the fraud intended againſt the creditors, if they verify by writ, or by oath of the party-receiver of any right from the dyvour or bankrupt, that the ſame was made without any true, juſt, and neceſſary cauſe, or without any true price; or that the lands or goods of the bankrupt being ſold by the interpoſed perſon, the price is to be converted to the bankrupt's profit and uſe. Fifth, All ſuch bankrupts, and interpoſed perſons for covering or executing their frauds, and all others who ſhall give counſel and aſſiſtance to the ſaid bankrupts in deviſing and practiſing their frauds and godleſs deceits to the prejudice of their true creditors, ſhall be reputed and holden diſhoneſt, falſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous perſons, incapable of all honours, dignities, benefices, and offices, or to paſs upon an inqueſt or aſſize, or to bear witneſs in judgment or outwith, in any time coming."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The clauſe reſtraining a bankrupt's partiality in making payment to favourite creditors and neglecting others, is expreſſed in the following terms: <q rend="inline">"If any bankrupt, or interpoſed perſon partaker of his fraud, ſhall make any voluntary payment or right to any perſon, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud of the more timely diligence of another creditor, having ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inhibition, or uſed horning, arreſtment, compriſing, or other lawful mean to affect the bankrupt's lands, goods, or price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; in that caſe the bankrupt, or interpoſed perſon, ſhall be bound to make the ſame forthcoming to the creditor having uſed the more timely diligence. And this creditor ſhall likewiſe have good action to recover from the co-creditor poſterior in diligence what was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily paid to him in defraud of the purſuer."</q>
               </p>
               <p>With reſpect to the article concerning fraud, this act is an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional inſtance of what I have had more than one opportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the court of ſeſſion, for many years after its inſtitution, acted as a court of common law only. No wrong calls louder for a remedy than frauds committed by bankrupts in concealing their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects from their creditors; and yet from the preamble of the act it appears, that the court of ſeſſion had not, before that period, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0743600300:317"/>
the power to redreſs any of theſe frauds. Nor is it clear that the power was aſſumed by the ſeſſion as a court of equity: it is more preſumeable that the court conſidered itſelf as a court of common law acting by legiſlative authority; firſt by authority of its own act, and afterward by authority of the act of parliament:—I ſay by authority of its own act; for the court of ſeſſion being impowered by parliament to make regulations for the better adminiſtration of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, an act of ſederunt originally was held equivalent to an act of parliament.</p>
               <p>This act, framed as we ought to ſuppoſe by the wiſeſt heads in the nation, is however not only ſhamefully imperfect, but in ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars groſsly unjuſt. No general regulations are eſtabliſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the conduct of the bankrupt, of his creditors, or of the jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: no ouvert act is fixed as a public notification of bankruptcy: nor is there any regulation barring the creditors from taking advantage of each other by precipitancy of execution. Such blindneſs is the leſs excuſable in judges to whom the Roman law was no ſtranger; and who, in an Engliſh bankrupt-ſtatute paſſed a few years before, had a good model to copy after, and to improve. But this act, which has occaſioned many irregular and even unjuſt deciſions, muſt be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more particularly.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, There cannot be a ſtronger inſtance of unſkilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in making laws, than the clauſe in the ſtatute confining the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of fraud to the writ or oath of the perſon who receives any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from the bankrupt. A very little inſight into human nature would have taught our judges, that it is in vain to think of detecting fraud by the evidence of thoſe who deal in it, whether as principals or acceſſories. Covered crimes muſt be detected by circumſtances, or not at all; and ſuch matters, being beyond the reach of a general rule, muſt be left with judges, without any rule other than to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine every caſe according to its peculiar circumſtances. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we ſhall have occaſion to ſee afterward, that the court of ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were forc'd to abandon the evidence eſtabliſhed by themſelves, and in every inſtance to indulge ſuch proof as the nature of the caſe would admit. In the ſecond place, With reſpect to deeds done againſt creditors in general, it may at firſt view appear ſtrange, that the act of ſederunt ſhould be confined to actual fraud; a crime that merits puniſhment, and to which accordingly a puniſhment is annexed in the act itſelf. It plainly reacheth not a gratuitous deed in favour of children or others, however prejudicial to creditors; provided it be not granted fraudulently in order to hurt them, but in order to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0743600300:318"/>
the donees. This palpable defect in the act will be accounted for by an obſervation one has occaſion to make daily, that in reforming abuſes, there is generally a degree of diffidence which prevents the innovation from being carried its due length. The repreſſing actual fraud was a great improvement, which filled the mind, and ſcarce left room for a thought that the improvement could be carried far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And, in all probability, it appeared a bolder ſtep to ſupply the defect of common law by voiding frauds committed by bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, than to ſupply the defect of the ſtatute by voiding alſo gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deeds.</p>
               <p>So much upon the firſt article; and, with reſpect to the ſecond, which is calculated to reſtrain the bankrupt from acting partially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his creditors, it is not in my power to give it any colour either of juſtice or expediency. I have been much diſpoſed to think, that an inchoated act of execution was intended by the legiſlature to be the public notification of bankruptcy ſo often mentioned. But I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to relinquiſh that thought, when I conſider, that our ſtatute 1621 is not confined to merchants, but comprehends the whole body of the people; and that an inchoated act of horning or arreſtment is ſcarce a mark of bankruptcy at preſent, far leſs when the act was made, with reſpect eſpecially to landed men. And that in fact it was not intended a mark or notification of bankruptcy, is clear from the following conſiderations, that creditors are not barred by it from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing payment by legal execution, nor even the bankrupt from acting partially among his creditors; for, excepting that creditor only who hath commenced execution, it continues in the bankrupt's power as much as ever to diſtribute his effects among his favourite creditors, leaving the reſt without a remedy. But it is fruitleſs to diſguiſe a truth which will be diſcovered by every perſon of reflection, that this clauſe in the ſtatute betrays groſs ignorance of juſtice. There ought, no doubt, to be a remedy againſt the creditor who obtains payment by the bankrupt's partiality: but to make him ſurrender the whole to the creditor who has got the ſtart in execution, is an unjuſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for juſtice only requires that he ſhould ſurrender a part, that both may be upon a level. To make him ſurrender the whole is indeed an effectual cure to the bankrupt's partiality, but a cure that is worſe than the diſeaſe; worſe, I ſay, becauſe the partiality of an individual is a ſpectacle much leſs diſguſting than is the partiality of law. This regulation is unjuſt, even ſuppoſing the bankruptcy to be known to the creditor who receives payment. But how much more glaring the injuſtice where he happens to be ignorant of that fact? the money he
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0743600300:319"/>
receives becomes undoubtedly his property, and juſtice forfeits not a man of his property without a fault; and therefore to wreſt from a creditor a ſum he has received <hi>bona fide</hi> in payment of a juſt debt, is in reality to inflict a puniſhment without a delinquency. Nor is this all. The regulation in itſelf unjuſt, is not leſs ſo with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to conſequences. Voluntary payment effectually binds up the creditor from forcing payment by legal execution: in the mean time the funds of the bankrupt are ſwept away by other creditors: and if, after all, the creditor be forc'd to ſurrender the whole ſum received by him in payment, he is left without a remedy, and is in a much worſe ſtate than if payment had not been offered him. Viewing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain this regulation with reſpect to utility, it appears not leſs inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient than unjuſt: to excite creditors to take the ſtart in execution, it holds out a premium, to which they are not intitled by the rules of juſtice; a premium therefore that tends to a very unhappy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>viz.</hi> to overwhelm with precipitant execution honeſt dealers, who, treated with humanity, might have emerged out of their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and have become bold and proſperous traders.</p>
               <p>The next bankrupt-ſtatute in order of time is the act 62. parl. 1661, ranking <hi>pari paſſu</hi> with the firſt effectual appriſing, all appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of a prior date, and all led within year and day of it; for I ſhall have occaſion to ſhow afterward, that this ſtatute ought to be claſſed with thoſe concerning bankruptcy, though not commonly conſidered in that light. But the connection of matter, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate than that of time, leads me firſt to the act 5. parl. 1696, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended evidently to ſupply the defects of the act 1621. Experience diſcovered in the act 1621 one defect mentioned above, that no ouvert act is aſcertained, to be held the firſt act of bankruptcy as well as a public notification of it. This defect is ſupplied by the act 1696, in the following manner. An inſolvent debtor under execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by horning and caption, is declared a notour bankrupt, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he be impriſoned, or retire to a ſanctuary, or fly, or abſcond, or defend his perſon by force. This is one term, and counting ſixty days backward, another term is fixed; after which all partial deeds by a bankrupt among his creditors are prohibited. The words are, <q rend="inline">"All diſpoſitions, aſſignations, or other deeds, granted by the bankrupt at any time within ſixty days before his notour bankruptcy, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a creditor, directly or indirectly, for his ſatisfaction or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecurity, preferring him to other creditors, ſhall be null and void."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It will be obſerved, that this ſtatute, with reſpect to the legal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0743600300:320"/>
of bankruptcy, differs widely from thoſe made in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And indeed, to have copied theſe ſtatutes, by making abſcond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or keeping out of the way, the firſt act of bankruptcy, would in this country have been improper. In England, arreſtment of the debtor's perſon till he find bail being generally the firſt act of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, a debtor, to avoid impriſonment, muſt abſcond or keep out of the way the moment his credit is ſuſpected; and therefore in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, abſconding or keeping out of the way is a mark of bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy not at all ambiguous. But in Scotland, this mark of bankruptcy would always be too late; for with us there muſt be ſeveral ſteps of execution before a bankrupt be forc'd to abſcond, letters of horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a charge, a denunciation, a caption. In this country therefore it was neceſſary to ſpecify ſome mark of bankruptcy antecedent to abſconding. The mark that would correſpond the neareſt to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconding in England, is denunciation upon a horning; for after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a charge, the debtor, if he have any credit, will be upon his guard againſt denunciation, ſuppoſing it to be eſtabliſhed as a public notification of bankruptcy. But our legiſlature perhaps ſhowed greater penetration, in commencing bankruptcy from a term of which even the bankrupt muſt be ignorant. Sudden bankruptcy is ſo rare as ſcarce to deſerve the attention of the legiſlature. A man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly becomes bankrupt long before he is publicly known to be ſo by ultimate execution; and conſidering that the ſuſpicious period, during which a debtor is tempted to act fraudulently, commences the moment he foreſees the ruin of his credit, which is generally more than two months before his notour bankruptcy, it appears the ſafeſt courſe to tie up a bankrupt's hands during that period. Such retroſpect from notour bankruptcy cannot be productive of any wrong, if it have no other effect but to void ſecurities, which creditors obtain by force of execution, or by the voluntary deed of their debtor. And therefore the ſtatute 1696, ſo far as concerns the commencement of bankruptcy, ſeems wiſe and political, and perhaps the beſt that is to be found in any country.</p>
               <p>The ſtatute adheres ſtrictly to the principles of equity above laid down, ſo far as it voids every ſecurity granted to one creditor in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the reſt, by their debtor, within ſixty days of his notour bankruptcy, or, in other words, after the commencement of his bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy aſcertained as above. But I muſt add, with regret, that it goes unwarily too far, when it voids alſo without diſtinction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances made in ſatisfaction or payment of debt. To deprive a man of a ſubject, the property of which he has obtained <hi>bona ſide</hi> in
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0743600300:321"/>
lieu of a debt, is, as obſerved above, inconſiſtent with an inviolable rule of juſtice, That an innocent man ought never to be forfeited of his property: and therefore a conveyance of this nature ought not to be voided, unleſs the creditor receiving ſatisfaction be in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his debtor's bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>But this is an error of ſmall importance compared with what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. After the commencement of bankruptcy, aſcertained as above, a bankrupt is prohibited to act partially among his creditors; and yet creditors are permitted, as in the act 1621, to act partially among themſelves, and to prevent each other by legal execution. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a creditor to take by legal execution what he is prohibited to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive voluntarily, is a glaring abſurdity. Payment or ſatisfaction obtained <hi>bona fide,</hi> whether from the bankrupt himſelf, or by force of execution, ought to be ſuſtained: but after the commencement of bankruptcy, there is the ſame juſtice for voiding a ſecurity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by execution, that there is for voiding a ſecurity obtained voluntarily from the bankrupt. And yet our legiſlature has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated ſo widely from juſtice, as to give full ſcope to execution even after notour bankruptcy. Nothing can be conceived more groſs. It had been a wiſe regulation, that upon notour bankruptcy a factor ſhould be appointed, to convert the bankrupt's effects into money, and to diſtribute the ſame among the creditors at the ſight of the court of ſeſſion. This regulation, eſtabliſhed in Rome and in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ought not to have been overlooked. But if it was not pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, our legiſlature ought at leaſt to have prohibited more to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by any execution, than a rateable proportion; for after notour bankruptcy no creditor can be <hi>in bona fide</hi> to take payment of his whole debt.</p>
               <p>The injuſtice and abſurdity of permitting a creditor to take by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution what he is diſcharged to receive from his debtor voluntarily, though left without remedy by our two capital bankrupt-ſtatutes, have not however been altogether overlooked. And I now proceed to the regulations made to correct that evil, which, for the ſake of connection, I have reſerved to the laſt place, though one of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations comes in point of time before the act 1696. The great load of debt contracted during our civil wars in the reign of Charles I. and the decay of credit occaſioned thereby, produced the act 62. parl. 1661, laying down regulations ſuited to the times, for eaſing debtors and reſtoring credit. Among other articles, <q rend="inline">"All appriſings deduced ſince the 1ſt of January 1652, before the firſt effectual appriſing, or after, but within year and day of the ſame, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0743600300:322"/>
to come in <hi>pari paſſu,</hi> as if one appriſing had been deduced for the whole."</q> This regulation is general without reſpect to bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy. But whatever ſtretches may be neceſſary for a particular exigency, it is evident, that the regulation cannot be juſtified as a perpetual law, except upon ſuppoſition that all the appriſings are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced after the debtor is inſolvent. A debtor while he is in good circumſtances, may pay his debts or grant real ſecurities in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he pleaſes. By uſing this privilege he harms none of his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: they have no ground for challenging ſuch a deed at the time when it is granted; and his ſupervening bankruptcy cannot afford them a ground of challenge which they had not at firſt. A ſecurity obtained by an appriſing or adjudication is preciſely ſimilar. If the debtor be ſolvent when ſuch judicial ſecurity is obtained by his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, the other creditors ſuffer not by it; and the adjudger who has thus fairly obtained a ſecurity, muſt be intitled to make the beſt of his right, whether the debtor afterward become inſolvent or not. I have reaſon therefore to place the foregoing ſtatute, conſidered as perpetual, among thoſe which have been enacted in the caſe of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy: and in order to fulfil the rules of juſtice, it is the duty of the court of ſeſſion, as a court of equity, to conſider it in that light. The involved circumſtances of debtors and creditors at the time of the ſtatute, made it a ſalutary regulation to bring in appriſers <hi>pari paſſu,</hi> even where the debtor was ſolvent, though evidently a ſtretch againſt juſtice: but to adhere ſtrictly to the regulation at preſent, when there is not the ſame neceſſity, is to adhere rigidly to the words againſt the mind and intendment of the legiſlature; for ſurely it could not be intended, that a creditor ſhould for ever be deprived of the preference he obtains by being the firſt adjudger, even though the other creditors are not hurt by that preference. That after the debtor's bankruptcy a creditor ſhould not be permitted to take more than his proportion of the common fund, is extremely juſt; and ſo far the ſtatute ought to be held perpetual. What farther is enacted to anſwer a particular purpoſe, ought to be conſidered as temporary; becauſe the legiſlature could not mean it to be perpetual.</p>
               <p>If then the foregoing ſtatute be held to be perpetual, it muſt be confined to the caſe of bankruptcy; and in that view it deſerves to be immortal. The firſt adjudication may be juſtly held a public mark or notification of the debtor's bankruptcy, warning the other creditors to beſtir themſelves; and a year commonly is ſufficient for them to lead adjudications, which, by authority of the ſtatute, will intitle each creditor to a proportion of the debtor's real eſtate. This
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0743600300:323"/>
was a happy commencement of a much wanted reformation. The court of ſeſſion, taking example, ventured to declare by an act of ſederunt <note n="*" place="bottom">Feb. 28. 1662.</note>, That the priority of a creditor's confirmation ſhall afford no preference in competition with other creditors confirming within ſix months of the death of their debtor. By another act of ſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt <note n="†" place="bottom">Auguſt 9. 1754.</note>, All arreſtments within ſixty days preceding the notour bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy, or within four months thereafter, are ranked <hi>par i paſſu;</hi> and every creditor who poinds within ſixty days preceding the notour bankruptcy, or within four months thereafter, is obliged to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a proportion to the other creditors ſuing him within a limited time <note n="‡" place="bottom">Act of ſederunt, ibid.</note>. In the heat of reformation, the laſt mentioned regulation is carried too far. Poinding operates at once a transference of the property and a diſcharge of the debt; and ſuppoſing a poinder to be ignorant of his debtor's inſolvency, which is frequently the caſe where the execution precedes the notour bankruptcy, there is no rule in equity more than at common law to oblige the poinder to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any proportion to the other creditors. Nay, it is poſſible that a debtor may be ſolvent within ſixty days of his notour bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy: a poinding againſt him in that caſe, which wounds not the other creditors, ought not to afford them the ſhadow of a claim.</p>
               <p>The principles of equity ripening gradually, our zeal for the act 1661 has increaſed; and there is a viſible tendency in our judges to make the remedy ſtill more complete. In order to that end, the court of ſeſſion, as a court of equity, might have enlarged the time given by the ſtatute for leading adjudications. The principles of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice authoriſe a ſtill bolder ſtep, which is to put upon an equal foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all adjudications that are led upon debts exiſting before the firſt adjudication. But the court of ſeſſion, wavering always as to their equitable powers, have not hitherto ventured ſo far. Not adverting to an obvious doctrine, That in order to fulfil juſtice it is lawful to enlarge or improve means laid down in a ſtatute, the court of ſeſſion hath not attempted directly to enlarge the time for bringing in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgers <hi>pari paſſu:</hi> but they do the ſame thing every day indirectly; for upon the application of any creditor, ſetting forth, <q rend="inline">"That if the common <hi>induciae</hi> required in the proceſſes of conſtitution and adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication be not abridged in his favour, he cannot hope to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete his adjudication within year and day of the adjudication firſt effectual,"</q> the court, without requiring any cauſe to be aſſigned for the delay, give authority for adjudging ſummarily; which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is declaring, that all adjudgers ſhall have the benefit of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0743600300:324"/>
provided the ſummons of adjudication be within year and day of the firſt effectual adjudication. It may be queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this is not too indulgent; for, as it appears to me, the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary privilege of ſhortening the forms ought not to be indulged, unleſs the creditor can aſſign ſome good cauſe for his delay; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the law ought not to be extended in favour of any man who ſuffers by his own fault or neglect. It is curious at the ſame time to obſerve, in what manner a court, like an individual, afraid of a bold ſtep, will, to ſhun it, venture upon one not leſs bold in reality, though perhaps leſs in appearance: for to abridge or diſpenſe with forms, ſalutary in themſelves, and ſanctified by inveterate prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, is an act of authority not leſs extraordinary, than to enlarge the time afforded in a ſtatute for ranking adjudgers <hi>pari paſſu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all, the foregoing regulations, calculated to put credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors upon a level in the caſe of bankruptcy, are mere palliatives: they ſoften the diſeaſe, but ſtrike not at the root. The court of ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion tried once a bolder and more effectual remedy, borrowed from the law of Rome and of England, <hi>viz.</hi> to name a factor for mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and diſpoſing of the bankrupt's moveable funds, in order that the price may be equally diſtributed among the creditors: and why that regulation was not made perpetual I cannot explain.</p>
               <p>According to the method propoſed in the beginning, nothing now remains but the operations of the court of ſeſſion, to which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, beginning with deciſions relative to the ſtatutes, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with deciſions founded on equity independent of the ſtatutes. And firſt, the ſtatute 1621 has been extended to a leaſe of land ſet to a truſtee at an undervalue, in order that the bankrupt himſelf might enjoy the profits. A leaſe of this nature, though not comprehended under the words of the act, comes plainly under its ſpirit and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore it is the duty of a court of equity to extend the act to this caſe. A fraudulent bond granted by a bankrupt in order to withdraw from the true creditors a part of the fund for the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt's own behoof, is another example of the ſame kind. For, as Sir George Mackenzie obſerves in his explication of this act, <q rend="inline">"Though neither tacks nor bonds be comprehended under the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the law, yet the reaſon of the law extends to them; and in laws founded on the principles of reaſon, extenſions from the ſame principles are natural. And in laws introduced for obviating of cheats, extenſions are moſt neceſſary, becauſe the ſame ſubtile and fraudulent inclination that tempted the debtor to cheat his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, will tempt him likewiſe to cheat the law, if the wiſdom and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0743600300:325"/>
prudence of the judge do not interpoſe."</q> A diſcharge granted by the bankrupt in order to cover a debt from his creditors for his own behoof, will alſo come under the act by an equitable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the evidence required in the firſt article of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 1621, for detecting fraudulent deeds, the court of ſeſſion hath aſſumed a power proper and peculiar to a court of equity. It has been forc'd to abandon the oath or writ of the partaker of the fraud, being a means altogether inſufficient to anſwer the end propoſed by the ſtatute, and in place of it to lay hold of ſuch evidence as can be had, according to the nature of the caſe. It is accordingly the practice of the court, after weighing circumſtances, to preſume ſometimes in favour of the deed till fraud be proved, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt the deed till a proof be brought of its being fair and honeſt. Thus a bond bearing borrowed money, granted by a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt to a conjunct and confident perſon, was preſumed to be fairly granted for the cauſe expreſſed; and the burden of proving it to have been granted without any juſt cauſe, was, in terms of the act, laid upon the purſuer of the reduction <note n="*" place="bottom">Durie, Jan. 22. 1630, Hope-Pringle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Carre.</note>. Again, a diſpoſition by a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt of his whole heritage to his ſon-in-law, upon the narrative of a price paid, was found probative, unleſs redargued by the diſponee's oath <note n="†" place="bottom">Durie, Jan. 17. 1632. Skene contra Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note>. A diſpoſition by a bankrupt to his brother, bearing to be for ſecurity of a ſum inſtantly borrowed, was ſuſtained; but admitting the cauſe expreſſed to be redargued by the diſponee's oath. And the judges diſtinguiſhed this caſe from that of a diſpoſition bearing a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration in general, which muſt be otherwiſe verified than by the diſpoſition <note n="‡" place="bottom">Gosford, Nov. 28. 1673, Campbell contra Campbell.</note>.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, in a reduction upon the act 1621 of a bond bearing borrowed money granted by a bankrupt to his brother, the judges thought, that though bonds <hi>inter conjunctos</hi> may prove where commercial dealings appear, yet in the preſent caſe no ſuch dealings were alledged, and the creditor's circumſtances made it improbable that he could have advanced ſuch a ſum, and therefore the bond was not ſuſtained as probative of its cauſe <note n="‖" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Forbes, Dec. 5. 1707, Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learic contra Glen.</note>. A diſpoſition of land by a bankrupt to his brother, bearing a valuable conſideration in general, was not ſuſtained as probative of its narrative in prejudice of prior
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0743600300:326"/>
creditors, but it was laid on the diſponee to aſtruct the ſame <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, Nov. 29. 1671, Whitehead contra Lidderdale.</note>. And he having ſpecified, that it was for a ſum of money advanced in ſpecie to his brother, which he offered to depone upon, the court found this not relevant <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, Dec. 14. 1671, inter coſdem.</note>. In a ſimilar caſe, the diſponee having produced two bonds due to him by the diſponer, and offering to give his oath that theſe were the cauſe of the diſpoſition, the court thought this ſufficient <note n="‡" place="bottom">Stair, Dec. 15. 1671, Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               <p>A diſpoſition by a bankrupt to a conjunct or confident perſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to a prior engagement as its cauſe, is not ſuſtained unleſs the prior engagement be inſtructed. Thus an aſſignment made by a bankrupt to a conjunct and confident perſon, bearing to be a ſecurity for ſums due to the aſſignee, was preſumed to be <hi>in fraudem credito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> unleſs the aſſignee would bring evidence of the debts referred to in the deed <note n="‖" place="bottom">Durie, Haddington, Feb. 12. 1622, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon contra Young.</note>. And the aſſignee ſpecifying, that he took the aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for behoof of a third party, one of the bankrupt's creditors, the aſſignment was ſuſtained <note n="**" place="bottom">Hope, (de creditoribus), Feb 27. 1622, inter coſdem.</note>. An aſſignment by a bankrupt to his brother, bearing to be a ſecurity for debts owing to him, was preſumed gratuitous, unleſs the aſſignee would inſtruct otherwiſe than by his own oath that he was creditor <note n="††" place="bottom">Durie, Jan. 29. 1629, Auld contra Smith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Stair, July 15. 1670, Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton contra Boyd.</note>. To ſupport the narrative of a diſpoſition by a bankrupt to his ſon, bearing for its cauſe certain debts undertaken by the ſon, it was judged ſufficient that the ſon offered to prove, by the creditors mentioned in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that he had made payment to them in terms of the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="‡‡" place="bottom">Stair, Jan. 9. 1672, Robertſon contra Robertſon.</note>. A diſpoſition by a bankrupt to his brother, bearing to be a ſecurity for certain ſums due by bond, was thought ſufficiently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by production of the bonds, unleſs the purſuer would offer to prove, that the bonds were granted after inſolvency. Here no ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious circumſtances occurred, other than the conjunction itſelf; and if ſuch a proof of a valuable conſideration be not held ſufficient, all commerce among relations will be at an end. It might upon the ſame footing be doubted, whether even a proof by witneſſes of the actual delivery of the money would be ſufficient, which might be done ſimulately, in order to ſupport a bond, as well as a bond be granted ſimulately in order to ſupport a diſpoſition <note n="‖‖" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Feb. 22. 1711, Rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Purdie.</note>. It will be
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0743600300:327"/>
obſerved, that ſome of the foregoing caſes are of bonds granted after bankruptcy, as for borrowed money, which ought not to be ſuſtained in equity. But the court of ſeſſion, as will be ſeen afterward, is in the practice of ſuſtaining ſuch bonds, for no better reaſon than that they are not prohibited by the bankrupt-ſtatutes.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the ſecond article of the act 1621, prohibiting pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made in prejudice of a creditor who is <hi>in curſu diligentiae,</hi> the court of ſeſſion, conſidering the injuſtice of wreſting from a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, ignorant of his debtor's bankruptcy, a ſum delivered to him in payment, ventured ſo far to correct the ſtatute as to refuſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a proceſs raiſed againſt a creditor who had obtained payment, for delivering the money to the creditor firſt in execution, unleſs it could be verified, that at the time of the payment the debtor was commonly reputed a bankrupt <note n="*" place="bottom">Dalrymple, Bruce, June 7. 1715, Tweedie contra Din.</note>. A debtor commonly reputed a bankrupt will always be held ſuch by his creditors; and a creditor knowing of his debtor's bankruptcy cannot juſtly take more than his proportion. Where payment is made before inchoated execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet within threeſcore days of notour bankruptcy, the court of ſeſſion hath no occaſion to extend its equitable powers to ſupport ſuch payment, which ſtands free of both ſtatutes; for the ſtatute 1621 challenges no payments but what are made after inchoated execution, and payments are not at all mentioned in the ſtatute 1696. Payments after notour bankruptcy are in a different caſe: they are barred in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, though not by the ſtatute 1696.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch of the act 1621, ſecuring a creditor who has commenced execution againſt the partiality of his debtor, is ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpreted by the court of ſeſſion, that where a ſecurity is void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a creditor prior in execution, the whole benefit is given to him, and the defendant who obtained the ſecurity is forfeited of it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the act 1696 is ſo ſtrictly interpreted, that moveables be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered to a creditor in ſatisfaction of his debt, the tranſaction was voided becauſe delivery was made within ſixty days of notour bankruptcy <note n="†" place="bottom">Dalrymple, Jan. 27. 1715, Forbes of Ballogie, July 19. 1728, Smith contra Taylor.</note>; though, abſtracting from the injuſtice of depriving an innocent man of his property, the court, in interpreting a rigorous ſtatute, ought to have limited the words within their narroweſt mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by finding that moveables, the commerce of which ought to be free, are not comprehended in the ſtatute.</p>
               <p>By the act 1696, as above obſerved, <q rend="inline">"All diſpoſitions, &amp;c. grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

The former meaning would be rational, ſuppoſing the creditors to be barred from execution as the bankrupt is from alienation: but as they are left free, the latter meaning ought to be adopted, as what anſwers the purpoſe of the legiſlature, and fulfils the rules of juſtice. And yet, I know not by what miſapprehenſion, the former is adopted by the court of ſeſſion. A diſpoſition accordingly of this kind was void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed totally; and other creditors, who had attached the ſubject by legal execution, were preferred, without giving the diſponee as much bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by his diſpoſition as even to bring him in <hi>pari paſſu</hi> with the other creditors <note n="*" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Dalrymple, Dec. 4. 1704, Man contra Reid. July 19. 1728, Smith contra Taylor.</note>. This is laying hold of the words of a ſtatute, without regarding its ſpirit and intendment. It is worſe: it is giving a wrong ſenſe to an ambiguous clauſe, in oppoſition to the ſpirit and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The obvious purpoſe of the act 1696 is not to deprive a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt altogether of the management of his affairs, for in that caſe a <hi>curator bonis</hi> muſt have been appointed, but only to bar him from acting partially. It clearly follows, that a court of equity, ſupporting the ſpirit of the law, ought not to have carried the reduction farther than to redreſs the inequality intended by the diſpoſition. The court fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an oppoſite courſe, not leſs partial to the purſuers of the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the diſpoſition was to the defendant: and their decree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly exceeded the bounds of juſtice on the one ſide, as much as the bankrupt's diſpoſition did on the other. The ſolidity of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning will be clearly apprehended, in applying it to a ſecurity grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a debtor in good credit, but who, within ſixty days thereafter, is a notour bankrupt. The creditor, being <hi>in optima ſide</hi> to take a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in theſe circumſtances, merits no puniſhment. Another credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, however, anxious about his debt, attaches the ſubject by legal execution; and thus gets the ſtart of the diſponee, whoſe hands by the diſpoſition are tied up from execution. Is it juſt or equitable to void the diſpoſition altogether, and to prefer the other creditor?</p>
               <p>With reſpect to particulars that come not under either of the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt-ſtatutes, but are left to be regulated by equity, it is ſurpriſing to obſerve the fluctuation of the court of ſeſſion between common law and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0743600300:329"/>
equity. In many inſtances, the court hath given way to the injuſtice of common law without affording a remedy; for a very odd reaſon indeed, That no remedy is provided by ſtatute. In other inſtances, the court, exerting its equitable powers, has boldly applied the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. I proceed to examples of both.</p>
               <p>A ſale by a notour bankrupt after the act 1696, was ſupported for the following reaſon, That it is not prohibited by the act 1696 <note n="*" place="bottom">Bruce, January 1. 1717, Burgh contra Gray.</note>. Very true. But then, as above demonſtrated, it is prohibited by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and by utility; and upon theſe <hi>media</hi> it ought to have been void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The court went ſtill farther, by ſuſtaining a bond for money lent to a known bankrupt <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, June 28. 1665, Monteith contra Anderſon.</note>. Upon the ſtatute 1696 it has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, whether an act be challengeable where no ſubject is aliened, and yet a partial preference is given. The caſe was as follows. An heir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>apparent having given infeftments of annualrent, did thereafter grant a procuratory to ſerve himſelf heir, that his infeftment might accreſce to the annualrent-rights. In a competition between theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrenters and poſterior adjudgers, it was objected againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatory, That it was granted by a notour bankrupt, and therefore null by the ſtatute 1696; the purpoſe of which is to annul every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial preference by a bankrupt, direct or indirect. It was anſwered, That the ſtatute mentions only alienations made by the bankrupt, and reaches not every act that may be attended with a conſequential da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or benefit to ſome of the creditors. The court preferred the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrenters <note n="‡" place="bottom">February 1728, Creditors of Graitney competing.</note>. Had the ſervuce been before the bankruptcy, there could be no reaſon in equity againſt it: but a man, who, conſcious of his own bankruptcy, performs any act in order to prefer one cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor before another, is unjuſt; and the creditor who takes advantage of that act, knowing his debtor to be bankrupt, is partaker of the wrong. The court therefore denying a remedy in this caſe, acted as a court of common law, overlooking its equitable powers.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite to the foregoing inſtances, I ſhall mention firſt a donation, the motive of which is love and favour to the donee, without any formed intention to wrong the creditors, though in effect they are wronged by it. That this caſe is not provided for in the ſtatue 1621, is evident from every clauſe in it. Fraud only is repreſſed: not fraud in a lax ſenſe, ſignifying every moral wrong by which a creditor is diſappointed of his payment; but fraud in its proper ſenſe, ſignifying a deliberate purpoſe to cheat creditors; that ſort of fraud which is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0743600300:330"/>
and merits puniſhment: which is put beyond doubt by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal clauſe, inflicting a puniſhment fully adequate to fraud in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe. But a gratuitous bond or alienation, of which the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is preciſely what is ſpoke out, without any purpoſe to cover the effects from the creditors, is not a fraud in any proper ſenſe, at leaſt not in a ſenſe to merit puniſhment. This then is left upon equity: and the court of ſeſſion, directed by the great principle of equity <hi>Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura,</hi> makes no difficulty to cut down a gratuitous bond or alienation granted by a bankrupt. With reſpect to a gratuitous bond, the court I believe has gone father: it has preferred the creditors upon an eventual bankruptcy, even where the granter was ſolvent when he made the donation. And indeed the court cannot do otherwiſe, without deviating from the principle now mentioned.</p>
               <p>Next comes a ſecurity given by a bankrupt in ſuch circumſtances as not to be challengeable upon either of the ſtatutes, being given, for example, before execution is commenced againſt the bankrupt, and more than ſixty days before his bankruptcy becomes notorious. It is made out above, that a court of equity ought to void ſuch a ſecurity, even though the creditor, ignorant of his debtor's bankruptcy, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſame <hi>bona fide.</hi> The court of ſeſſion, it is true, hath not hitherto ventured to adopt this equitable regulation in its full extent; but the court hath made vigorous approaches to it, by voiding ſuch ſecurity where-ever any collateral circumſtance could be found that appeared to weigh in any degree againſt the creditor. Thus, a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given by a bankrupt to one of his creditors, who was his near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, was voided, though the diſpoſition came not under either of the bankrupt-ſtatutes <note n="*" place="bottom">Fountainhall, January 28. 1696, Scrymzcour contra Lyon.</note>. In the ſame manner, a diſpoſition <hi>omnium bonorum,</hi> as a ſecurity to a ſingle creditor, is always voided. And here it merits obſervation, that the court of ſeſſion acting upon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of equity, is more correct in its decrees, than where it acts by authority of the ſtatutes; witneſs the following caſe. <q rend="inline">"A debtor againſt whom no execution was commenced, having granted a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>omnium bonorum</hi> as a ſecurity to one of his creditors, another creditor arreſted in the diſponee's hands, and in the forthcoming inſiſted, that the diſpoſition was null, and that the ſubject ought to be made forthcoming to him upon his arreſtment. The court reduced to the effect of bringing in the arreſter <hi>pari paſſu</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">February 25. 1737, Cramond contra Bruce.</note>."</q> The
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0743600300:331"/>
following caſe, though varying in circumſtances, is built upon the preciſe ſame foundation. Robert Grant, conſcious of his inſolvency, and reſolving to prefer his favourite creditors, executed privately in their favour a ſecurity upon his land-eſtate, which in the ſame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate manner he completed by infeftment. This ſecurity being kept latent, even from thoſe for whom it was intended, gave no alarm, and Robert Grant did not become a notour bankrupt for many months thereafter. But the peculiar circumſtances of this caſe, a real ſecurity beſtow'd on creditors who were not making any demand, ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin given clandeſtinely, &amp;c. were clear evidence of the granter's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of his bankruptcy, as well as of his intention to act par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and unjuſtly among his creditors; and the court accordingly voided the ſecurity as far as it gave preference to the creditors therein named; <hi>November</hi> 10. 1748, <hi>Sir Archibald Grant contra Grant of Lurg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After finiſhing the inſtances promiſed, another point demands our attention. With reſpect to an alienation bearing to be granted for love and favour, or made to a near relation, and therefore in caſe of bankruptcy preſumed gratuitous, a doctrine eſtabliſhed in the court of ſeſſion by a train of deciſions, appears ſingular. It is held, that the purchaſer from ſuch diſponee, though he pay a full price, is in no better condition than his author, and that a reduction at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bankrupt's creditors will reach both equally. This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ought not to paſs current without examination, for its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are terrible. At that rate, every ſubject acquired upon a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative title is withdrawn from commerce for the ſpace at leaſt of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years. What ſhall become of thoſe who purchaſe from heirs if this doctrine hold? And if a purchaſer from an heir of proviſion, for example, be ſecure, why not a purchaſer from a gratuitous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponee? What objection ſhould lie againſt the purchaſer is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, conſidering that a purchaſer even from a notour bankrupt is, in the practice of the court of ſeſſion, held to be ſecure; which is at leaſt a good <hi>argumentum ad hominem.</hi> The only reaſon urged in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this doctrine is, That a purchaſer cannot pretend to be <hi>in bona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fide</hi> when his author's right appears to be gratuitous, or is preſumed gratuitous. I cannot perceive the weight of this reaſon. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to anſwer in the firſt place, That if we adhere to the act 1621, there can be no foundation for ſuch reduction: for if, even in the caſe of a fraudulent conveyance to an interpoſed perſon, a purchaſer <hi>bona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fide</hi> from that perſon be ſecure, what doubt can there be that a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer from a gratuitous diſponee is alſo ſecure, where the gratuitous
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0743600300:332"/>
diſponee is innocent of any fraud? In the next place, Conſidering this matter upon the principles of equity, a gratuitous deed is not ſubject to reduction unleſs granted by a bankrupt; and to put a man who purchaſes from a gratuitous diſponee <hi>in mala fide,</hi> the bankruptcy ought to be known to him as well as that his author's title is gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous. And yet I find not that the purchaſer's knowledge of the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy has ever been held a neceſſary circumſtance; one caſe except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reported by Fountainhall <note n="*" place="bottom">November 28. 1693, Spence contra Creditors of Dick.</note>: <q rend="inline">"It is not ſufficient to reduce the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer's right that he knew his author's relation to the bankrupt, unleſs he was alſo in the knowledge of the bankruptcy; becauſe there is no law to bar a man in good circumſtances from making a donation to a near relation. And knowledge, an internal act, muſt be gathered from circumſtances, the moſt pregnant of which is, that the granter of the gratuitous deed was at the time held and reputed a bankrupt."</q> But, in the third place, Suppoſing the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy known to the purchaſer, I deny that this circumſtance can ſupport the reduction either at common law or in equity: it is made evident above, that a gratuitous diſponee ignorant of his author's bankruptcy, is not bound to yield the ſubject to the bankrupt's cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, but only to account to them for the value; and when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the ſubject for a full price, this ſale, ſo far from diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obligation he is under to the bankrupt's creditors, enables him to perform it. In one caſe only will the purchaſer's right be voided in equity; and that is where the gratuitous diſponee and the purchaſer from him are both of them <hi>in mala fide:</hi> a man who takes a gratuitous diſpoſition knowing his author to be bankrupt, is guilty of a wrong, which binds him in conſcience to reſtore the ſubject itſelf to the bankrupt's creditors; and the perſon who purchaſes from him knowing that he is ſo bound, being alſo guilty, is for that reaſon bound equally to reſtore.</p>
               <p>The ſtatute 1696, voiding all diſpoſitions, aſſignments, or other deeds, granted by a bankrupt to a favourite creditor, ſeems to have no ſubjects in view but what are locally in Scotland, within the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the court of ſeſſion. And indeed it would be fruitleſs to void a diſpoſition granted by a Scotch bankrupt of his foreign effects; becauſe ſuch effects will be regulated by the law of the place, and not by a decree pronounced in Scotland. Suppoſing then ſuch a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be granted, is there no remedy? It is certainly a moral wrong for a bankrupt to convey to one of his creditors what ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0743600300:333"/>
among all; and the creditor who accepts ſuch ſecurity knowing his debtor's inſolvency, is acceſſory to the wrong. Upon this ground, the court of ſeſſion, though they cannot void the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may, as a court of equity, ordain the favourite creditor to repair the loſs that the other creditors have ſuſtained by it; which will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the favourite creditor either to ſurrender the effects, or to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the value. And this was decreed in the court of ſeſſion, July 18. 1758, Robert Syme clerk to the ſignet contra George Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tenant in Dalhouſie.</p>
               <p>Of late years it has been much controverted, whether a diſpoſition <hi>omnium bonorum</hi> by a notour bankrupt to truſtees for behoof of his whole creditors, be voidable upon the bankrupt-ſtatutes. Formerly ſuch diſpoſitions were ſuſtained, as not being prohibited by any clauſe in either of the ſtatutes. But the court at laſt ſettled in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opinion, <q rend="inline">"That no diſpoſition by a bankrupt can diſable his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors from doing diligence <note n="*" place="bottom">July 12. 1734, Snee contra Truſtees of Anderſon. Feb. 3. 1736, Earl of Aberdeen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Truſtees of Blair.</note>."</q> This opinion, founded on juſtice and expediency, though not upon the bankrupt-ſtatutes, ought to govern the court of ſeſſion as a court of equity. It belongs not to the bankrupt, though proprietor, to direct the management of his funds; but to his creditors, who are more intereſted in that manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he is. It belongs therefore to the creditors to direct the method by which the funds ſhall be turned into money for their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if they chuſe to have the effects managed by truſtees, it is their privilege, not the bankrupt's, to name the truſtees. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, however, from this conſideration, that thoſe truſt-rights only which are impoſed by bankrupts upon their creditors, ought to be voided. There lies evidently no objection, either at common law or in equity, againſt a diſpoſition <hi>omnium bonorum</hi> ſolicited by the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and granted by the bankrupt to truſtees of their naming. On the contrary, a truſt-right of that nature, which ſaves the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>curator bonis,</hi> as in Rome, or of commiſſioners, as in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, merits the greateſt favour, being an expeditious and frugal method of managing the bankrupt's funds for behoof of his creditors. And ſuppoſing ſuch a meaſure to be concerted among the bulk of the creditors, a court of equity ought not to regard a few diſſenting creditors who incline to follow ſeparate meaſures. The truſt-right is good at common law, being an alienation by a proprietor; and it is good in equity as being a juſt act. It muſt accordingly afford a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0743600300:334"/>
to the creditors who lay hold of it. A diſſenting creditor may, if he pleaſe, proceed to execution againſt his debtor, and he may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach the imaginary reverſion implied in the truſt-diſpoſition: but ſuch peeviſh meaſures cannot hurt the other creditors who are ſecured by the truſt-right; for if that right be not voidable, it muſt be preferred before an adjudication, or any other execution, at the inſtance of a diſſenting creditor.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Powers and Faculties.</head>
               <p>EVERY right, real or perſonal, is a legal power to perform certain acts. In this extenſive ſenſe there are numberleſs powers. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very individual hath power over his own property, and over his own perſon; ſome over another's property or perſon. To trace all theſe powers would be the ſame with writing a body of law. The powers under conſideration are of a ſingular kind. They are not rights, properly ſpeaking, but they are means by which rights can be created, a power, for example, to make a man debtor for a ſum, a power to charge his land with debt, a power to redeem land from the purchaſer.</p>
               <p>Theſe powers are of two kinds; powers that ariſe from conſent merely, and powers that ariſe from property. Where a man diſpones his eſtate to his heir abſolutely and irredeemably, impowering a third perſon to charge the heir or the land with a ſum, this is an example of the firſt kind: a power thus created is founded on the conſent of the heir, ſignified by his acceptance of the diſpoſition. A power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a ſettlement of a land-eſtate, to alter the ſettlement, or to burden the land with debt, is an example of the other kind: by ſuch ſettlement the property is underſtood to be reſerved to the maker, as far as to impower him to alter or to burden. In this view, theſe powers may be termed <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>real.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To explain a power of the firſt kind, which is properly termed <hi>a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> in contradiſtinction to a power founded on property, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, 1 <hi>mo,</hi> That with regard to pecuniary intereſt, a man may ſubject himſelf to the power of another: he may gratuitouſly bind himſelf to pay a ſum of money; or he may impower any perſon to burden him with a ſum. 2<hi>do,</hi> He may alſo ſubject his property to the power of another: a proprietor can impower any perſon to charge his land
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0743600300:335"/>
with an infeftment of annualrent; and a real right thus eſtabliſhed is good even at common law. Thus it is laid down by our writers, that the proprietor's conſent will validate a reſignation made by one who hath no right <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, tit. Extinction of infeftments, § 7.</note>, and will validate alſo an annualrent-right granted by one who is not proprietor <note n="†" place="bottom">Durie, Dec. 15. 1630, Stirling contra tenants.</note>. 3<hi>tio,</hi> Though an annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent-right thus granted by a perſon having a faculty to burden the land, is a real right, not leſs complete than if granted by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor; yet the faculty itſelf is not a real right: it may indeed be exerted while the granter continues proprietor; his conſent makes it effectual: but his conſent cannot operate after he is diveſted of his property, more than if he never had been proprietor: in that caſe it is a conſent by one to burden the property of another; an act that can have no effect in law. Thus a power granted by a proprietor to charge his land with a certain ſum, ceaſes by his ſelling the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the faculty is exerted. Nor in ſtrict law can ſuch faculty be exerted after the granter's death. Whether equity may not in this caſe interpoſe, is more doubtful. Let us ſuppoſe, that a man makes a deed, impowering certain perſons to name proviſions to his young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er children after his death, and to burden his heir and land-eſtate with the payment; leaving at the ſame time his eſtate to deſcend to his heir at law by the courſe of ſucceſſion. This deed cannot be effectual at common law; becauſe it is inconſiſtent with the nature of property that a burden can be impoſed upon the eſtate of any man without his conſent. It ſeems however juſt, that a court of equity ſhould interpoſe to make ſo rational a faculty effectual againſt the heir, though not to charge the eſtate. The faculty, it is true, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered as a debt due by the anceſtor to ſubject the heir by repreſentation: but it is the will of the anceſtor to burden the heir with proviſions to his younger children; and in equity the will of the anceſtor ought to be a law to the heir who ſucceeds by that very will, implied though not expreſſed. In the law of England accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, where lands are deviſed to be ſold for younger childrens portions, and the executor dies without ſelling, the heir is compelled to ſell. And where lands were ordered to be ſold for payment of debts, without impowering any perſon to ſell, it was decreed that the heir ſhould ſell <note n="‡" place="bottom">1. Chancery caſes 176.</note>. But a ſettlement of an eſtate made by the proprietor upon any of his blood-relations that his wife ſhould think proper to nominate after his death, is effectual at common law: for
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0743600300:336"/>
there is nothing in reaſon or in law to bar a proprietor from making a ſettlement upon any perſon he has a mind, whether named by himſelf, or by another having his authority. The ſettlement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the heir at law, and the perſon named has a good title by his deed <note n="*" place="bottom">Nov. 28. 1729, Murray contra Fleeming.</note>.</p>
               <p>That ſort of power which is a branch of property, is in a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent condition. It is in its nature effectual againſt all ſingular ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, even <hi>bona ſide</hi> purchaſers; for a diſponee to whom the property is conveyed to a limited effect only, cannot beſtow upon another a more extenſive right than he himſelf has.</p>
               <p>It may be laid down as a general rule, That powers reſerved in a diſpoſition of land, the moſt limited as well as the moſt extenſive, are all of them branches of the property. To verify this rule, it muſt be premiſed, that all the powers a man hath over his own ſubject are involved in his right of property; and that the meaning of a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is not to create a new right, but only to limit the right that is convey'd. From theſe premiſes it clearly follows, that the reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any power over the land muſt ſo far imply a reſervation of the property: and this muſt hold, however limited the reſerved power be, or however extenſive, unleſs it be expreſſed in clear terms, that a faculty only is intended. A ſeparate argument concurs for this rule. Human nature, which, in matters of intereſt, makes a man generally prefer himſelf before others, founds a natural, and therefore a legal, preſumption, that when a diſponer reſerves to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any power over the ſubject diſponed, his intention is to reſerve it in the ampleſt and moſt effectual manner. And hence, <hi>in dubio,</hi> the preſumption will lie for a power properly ſo called, in oppoſition to a faculty. Thus a reſerved power to charge the eſtate diſponed with a ſum, though the moſt limited power that can be reſerved, is held to be a reſervation of the property, ſo as to make the reſerved power good even againſt a purchaſer from the diſponee. A man diſponed his eſtate to his eldeſt ſon, reſerving a power <q rend="inline">"to affect or burden the ſame with a ſum named for proviſions to his children."</q> The ſon's creditors appriſed the eſtate, and were infeft. Thereafter the diſponer exerted his reſerved power, by granting to his children heritable bonds, upon which they alſo were infeft; and in a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition they were preferred <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, Dirleton, Jan. 6. 1677, Creditors of Mouſwell contra Children. Stair. Dec. 16. 1679, inter eoſdem.</note>: the reſerved power was juſtly deemed a branch of property, which made every deed done in purſuance of it
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0743600300:337"/>
a preferable right upon the land. James Henderſon, in his eldeſt ſon's contract of marriage, diſponed to him the lands of Grange, <q rend="inline">"reſerving to himſelf power and faculty, even <hi>in articulo mortis,</hi> to burden the land with 8000 merks to any perſon he ſhould think fit."</q> In his teſtament he legated the ſaid 8000 merks to his three younger ſons; who, in a ranking of the eldeſt ſon's creditors, were preferred before all the creditors <note n="*" place="bottom">Henderſons contra Creditors of Francis Henderſon, July 8. 1760.</note>.</p>
               <p>But though a faculty regularly exerted while the granter conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues proprietor, will lay a burden on the land effectual againſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers, and though a power will have the ſame effect at whatever time exerted, it follows not that every exertion of a power or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will be ſo effectual: which leads us to examine in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they muſt be exerted in order to be effectual againſt purchaſers. That land may be charged with debt without infeftment, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving a title in the feudal form, is evident from a rent-charge, and from a clauſe in a conveyance of land burdening the land with a certain ſum <note n="†" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical Law-tracts, tract 4. p. 244.</note>. That without infeftment ſuch a burden may be laid on land by means of a power or faculty to burden, ſeems equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſtent; and were there a record of bonds granted in purſuance of ſuch powers, there would be nothing repugnant to utility more than to law in ſuſtaining them as real rights. But as no record is appointed for bonds of this kind, it is a wiſe and ſalutary regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuſtain none of them as real rights, unleſs where created in the feudal form to produce infeftment; which brings them under the ſtatute 1617, requiring all ſeiſins to be recorded. Where land ſtands charged with a ſum by virtue of a clauſe contained in the diſpoſition, no inconvenience ariſes from ſupporting this right, according to its nature, againſt all ſingular ſucceſſors; for a purchaſer from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponee is put upon his guard by the diſpoſition containing the burden, which diſpoſition makes part of his title-deeds. But a power or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, could it be exerted without infeftment, might occaſion great imbarraſſment: the power or faculty, it is true, appears on the face of the diſpoſition, which is a title-deed that muſt be delivered to a purchaſer; but then a purchaſer has no means to diſcover whether the power or faculty be exerted, or to what extent. Nay further, if a ſimple bond be held an exertion, there can be no limitation: for bonds referring to the faculty may be granted for L. 10,000, though the faculty be limited to the twentieth part of that ſum. And ſuch uncertainty would put the land <hi>extra commercium</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0743600300:338"/>
the ſpace of the long preſcription, commencing at the death of the diſponer, who reſerved to himſelf the power of burdening the land. The foregoing regulation is accordingly in ſtrict obſervance. By the deciſion mentioned above, Creditors of Mouſwell <hi>contra</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it appears, that when a reſerved power to burden land is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly exerted, by granting an infeftment of annualrent, ſuch annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent-right is preferred even before a prior infeftment derived from the diſponee: but a ſimple bond is never ſo preferred. Thus a man who diſponed his eſtate to his eldeſt ſon, reſerving to himſelf a power to burden the ſame with 5000 merks, granted thereafter ſimple bonds for that ſum to his wife and children, proceeding upon the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the reſerved power. After the date of theſe bonds, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponee contracted debts, which were eſtabliſhed upon the eſtate by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments. A competition ariſing between theſe two ſets of creditors after the diſponer's deceaſe, the diſponee's creditors were preferred upon their infeftments <note n="*" place="bottom">June 26. 1735, Ogilvies contra Turnbull.</note>. In a diſpoſition to the eldeſt ſon, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having reſerved power to charge the eſtate with wadſets or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments of annualrent to the extent of a ſum certain, a ſimple bond referring to the faculty was not deemed a real burden; and for that reaſon it was not held to be effectual againſt a donatar of the ſon's forfeiture <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, July 12. 1671, Lermont contra Earl of Lauderdale.</note>. But where the diſponer reſerves a power to burden the land with a ſum to one perſon named, the heir-male of a ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for example, and thereafter grants a ſimple bond to that perſon referring to the reſerved power; it ſeems not unreaſonable that this bond ſhould be deemed a real burden effectual againſt purchaſers. For here there is no uncertainty to put the land <hi>extra commercium:</hi> the burden can never exceed the ſum ſpecified in the diſpoſition; and after the diſponer's death, a purchaſer, by inquiring at the perſon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, has acceſs to know whether and to what extent the power has been exerted.</p>
               <p>If the foregoing regulation hold in reſerved powers, there can be no doubt of it with reſpect to faculties properly ſo called. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing deciſions I think belong to this claſs. A purchaſer of land took the diſpoſition to himſelf in liferent, and to his ſon <hi>nominatim</hi> in fee, with power to himſelf to diſpone, wadſet, &amp;c. He thereafter granted a ſimple bond, upon which the creditor adjudged the eſtate after the ſon was diveſted, and a purchaſer infeft. The adjudication was evidently void, and the bond was decreed not to be a proper
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0743600300:339"/>
exertion of the faculty to burden the eſtate, or be effectual againſt ſingular ſucceſſors <note n="*" place="bottom">Home, February 1719, Rome contra Creditors of Graham. November 1725, Sinclair contra Sinclair of Barrack.</note>. This is properly an inſtance of a faculty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the power which the father provided to himſelf could not be founded on the property which was never in him. Again, a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of land having taken the diſpoſition to himſelf in liferent, and to his ſon <hi>nominatim</hi> in fee, with a faculty <q rend="inline">"to burden, contract debt, and to ſell or otherwiſe diſpoſe at his pleaſure,"</q> did firſt grant a ſimple bond, declaring it a burden on the land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſold the land. The purchaſer was preferred, the bond not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a real burden on the land <note n="†" place="bottom">Forbes, December 16. 1708,Davidſon contra Town of Aberdeen.</note>.</p>
               <p>The caſes above mentioned are governed by the rules of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law: and as a <hi>bona fide</hi> purchaſe for a valuable conſideration is the higheſt title of property, this title, if good at common law, will never be impugned in equity; and for that reaſon, a power to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when it enters the liſts againſt ſuch a purchaſe, is confined within the narroweſt bounds. A faculty to impoſe a perſonal bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſtands upon more advantageous ground: where a valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration has been given, it is ſupported in equity beyond the bounds of common law. In particular, where the will of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who reſerves the faculty appears to be more extenſive than the reſerving words, equity interpoſes to give the faculty its intended ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Thus in a gratuitous diſpoſition of a land-eſtate, a power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to burden the ſame with ſums to a certain extent, has evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a valuable conſideration; and yet this power will not at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law intitle the diſponer to ſubject the diſponee perſonally: but the diſponee will be liable in equity, becauſe it could not have been the intention of the diſponer, reſerving power over the land, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude himſelf from a power of burdening alſo the diſponee; and therefore it muſt have been an overſight in the writing that power was not reſerved to burden the diſponee as well as the land. And hence in the deciſions above mentioned, Rome contra Creditors of Graham, Sinclair contra Sinclair of Barrack, and Ogilvies contra Turnbull, though a ſimple bond granted in purſuance of a power to burden the land was held not to be a real right; it was held how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from the implied will of the deceaſed, to be a burden upon the diſponee perſonally. And in like manner, a ſimple bond grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in purſuance of a reſerved power to burden the land diſponed, was found effectual againſt the diſponee perſonally, ſo as to ſupport
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0743600300:340"/>
an adjudication of the land againſt the diſponee after the diſponer's death <note n="*" place="bottom">January 17. 1723, Creditors of Ruſco contra Blair of Senwick.</note>. But a faculty granted to a third perſon for his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof without any valuable conſideration, is in a different condition: he is <hi>in pari caſu</hi> with the diſponee, the rights of both being by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition gratuitous. In this caſe it appears that the faculty ought not to be extended beyond the words of the grant.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing now a ſimple bond to be granted without referring to the reſerved faculty, will this bond be in equity deemed an exertion of the faculty, yea or not? If the granter have no other fund of payment, this circumſtance infers a rational preſumption that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an exertion of the faculty: if he have a ſeparate fund, the preſumption ceaſes, and that fund only muſt be attached for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But again, what if the ſeparate fund be not altogether ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient? In this caſe a court of equity may juſtly interpoſe to make what is deficient effectual by means of the reſerved faculty, in order to fulfil the will of the perſon who granted the bond. Thus a man, upon the narrative of love and favour, having diſponed his eſtate to his eldeſt ſon, reſerving a power to burden the eſtate to the extent of a ſum named, granted thereafter a perſonal bond of proviſion to his children without any relation to the reſerved power. In a ſuit for payment againſt the diſponee's repreſentatives it was objected, That the diſponer at the date of the bond had an opulent fund of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, and that there is no preſumption he intended to charge with this debt either his ſon or the eſtate diſponed. The diſponer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s will was preſumed to be, that the bond ſhould burden his executors in the firſt place, and the diſponee in the ſecond place <note n="†" place="bottom">Stair, Dirleton, June 21. 1677, Hope-Pringle contra Hope-Pringle.</note>. By marriage-articles the eſtate was provided to heirs-male, with power to burden the eſtate with a ſum named for the heirs of a ſecond marriage. The proprietor contracting a ſecond marriage, made a proviſion for the children of that marriage, burdening his heir with the ſame, but not charging his eſtate in terms of the reſerved power. At common law the eſtate was not ſubjected, becauſe the proviſion was not made a burden upon it; nor was the heir ſubjected, becauſe the reſerved power intitled the granter to burden the eſtate only. The court ſteered a right courſe in equity: the heir was made liable <hi>ultimo loco</hi> after his father's other eſtate ſhould be diſcuſſed <note n="‡" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Dalrymple, June 23. 1698, Carnegie contra Laird Kinſauns.</note>.</p>
               <p>It has been queſtioned, whether a reſerved power to charge with a ſum the land diſponed, can benefit a creditor whoſe debt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted before the reſerved power was created. The court thought
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0743600300:341"/>
it reaſonable that this power ſhould be ſubjected to the diſponer's debts, whether prior or poſterior <note n="*" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Dalrymple Dec. 16. 1698, Eliot of Swinſide contra Eliot of Meikle-dean.</note>. But it is certainly a miſtake in principles to ſubject a power or faculty, like a <hi>corpus,</hi> to the payment of debt. A power to charge an eſtate with debt, being ſtrictly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, is incommunicable to a creditor or to any other, even during the life of the perſon privileged; not to talk of his or her death. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity however rules, that a power or faculty ſhould be available to creditors, prior as well as poſterior: for it is the duty of a debtor to uſe all lawful means for paying his debts, whether by ſelling his goods or exerting his faculties; and if he unjuſtly refuſe, equity will hold the faculty as exerted for the benefit of the creditors. In the preſent caſe, the creditors will have acceſs to the land for their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if the debtor had exerciſed his faculty, and burdened the land with the ſum mentioned, payable to them. But if the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors lie dormant during their debtor's life, and make no ſtep to avail themſelves of his reſerved faculty, the faculty dies with him, and they can take nothing by it. A man diſponed to his ſons of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond marriage ſeveral parcels of land, <q rend="inline">"reſerving to himſelf full power and faculty to alter and innovate, and to contract debt as fully and freely as if the entire fee were in him."</q> The queſtion occurred, Whether theſe diſponees were liable to their father's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal debts contracted before the exiſtence of the ſaid power; and the affirmative was decreed <note n="†" place="bottom">July 21. 1724, Creditors of Ruſco contra Blair of Senwick.</note>. But in caſes of this nature, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponee, even where he is heir-apparent, is liable <hi>in valorem</hi> only <note n="‡" place="bottom">Dalrymple, January 18. 1717, Abercrombie contra Graham.</note>: for the diſponee is not liable at common law; and equity ſubjects no man farther than <hi>in valorem</hi> of the ſubject he receives.</p>
               <p>The exertion of a reſerved power to charge land with a ſum, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a formal deed; becauſe every act of will concerning land, conveying the property or burdening it, muſt be declared by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal writing: but the exertion of a faculty to charge a man perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with a ſum, ſeems not to require writing. It is ſufficient that the act of will be proved by witneſſes or other ſatisfactory evidence. Thus a man ſettled his eſtate on his eldeſt ſon, reſerving a power, by deed or will under ſeal, to charge the land with any ſum not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding L. 500. He prepares a deed appointing the L. 500 to his younger children, and gets it ingroſſed, but dies before it is ſigned or ſealed. This in equity ſhall amount to a good execution of his power, the ſubſtance being performed <note n="‖" place="bottom">Abridg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caſes in equity, chap. 44. ſect. B. § 14.</note>. Land cannot be charged
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0743600300:342"/>
but by a formal deed; becauſe what is required by common law cannot be overturned by a court of equity: but this court may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a defect in common law, by ſubjecting the heir perſonally upon an incompleted deed, which, though not regarded at common law, is ſatisfactory evidence of will. In one caſe the court of ſeſſion made a much wider ſtep, which was to find the diſponee liable for the ſum in a reſerved power, though the diſponer had not uſed his power by granting a bond, nor ſo much as ſhowed any will to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert it <note n="*" place="bottom">Gosford, February 15. 1673, Graham contra Lord Morphey.</note>. Though this was a moſt favourable caſe, the power reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved being to provide younger children, it was a ſtretch however that even equity cannot juſtify. For what better evidence need a man give of his reſolution not to exert a power or faculty, than his forbearing to exert it? If ſo, here is a judgement that contradicts will in place of ſupporting it.</p>
               <p>A power granted to diſtribute a ſum or a ſubject among children, or others, is limited in equity to be exerciſed <hi>ſecundum arbitrium boni viri,</hi> unleſs an abſolute power be expreſſed in the cleareſt terms. Thus a man deviſed to his wife his perſonal eſtate upon truſt and confidence, <q rend="inline">"That ſhe ſhould not diſpoſe thereof but for the benefit of her children."</q> She by will gave one but five ſhillings, and all the reſt to another. The court ſet aſide ſo unequal a diſtribution <note n="†" place="bottom">1. Vernon 66.</note>. A man by his will directed that his land ſhould deſcend to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <q rend="inline">"in ſuch ſhares and proportions as his wife by deed in writing ſhould direct and appoint."</q> The wife makes an unequal diſtribution. The court at firſt declared the circumſtances muſt be very ſtrong, as ſomething of bribery and corruption, that would take from the wife a power given her by the will; but afterward declared the caſe was proper for equity, and that the plaintiff might be relieved. For as the plaintiff was allowed but a ſmall proportion, ſhe might for any cauſeleſs diſpleaſure have been put off with one barren acre only; that the court in ſuch a caſe would have had a juriſdiction, and therefore here alſo <note n="‡" place="bottom">1.

               <p>Whether and in what caſes a reſerved power or faculty can effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually be exerciſed on deathbed, has frequently been agitated in the court of ſeſſion. One point appears clear, that a reſerved power to alter or burden on deathbed, contained in a diſpoſition to a ſtranger, may be exerciſed on deathbed, ſuppoſing always the granter to be <hi>ſanae mentis.</hi> And the reaſon is, that the ſtranger <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aying hold of the diſpoſition, muſt ſubmit to its qualities, and cannot object to the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0743600300:343"/>
conditions upon which it is granted. The great difficulty is where the ſettlement is upon the heir, who is <hi>alioqui ſucceſſurus;</hi> as to which our deciſions ſeem not to be uniform, nor any good rule laid down by our writers. If the heir have not by acceptance of the diſpoſition conſented to the burdening clauſe, his privilege of challenging a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den laid upon him on deathbed, remains entire. But if he have taken infeftment upon the diſpoſition, and be in poſſeſſion, which implies his conſent to every clauſe in the deed, will not this conſent bar him from objecting to the faculty, though exerted on deathbed? This requires deliberation. What diſtinguiſhes an heir from a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is his dependence upon the predeceſſor for the eſtate, leaving him no freedom of choice: he muſt ſubmit to the will of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor under the peril of exheredation. But does this dependence preſume co-action in every tranſaction between a man and his heir? This can hardly be maintained; for what if the reſerved faculty be to burden the eſtate with a moderate proviſion to younger children, or to do any other pious or rational act? In ſuch a caſe, no good man would with-hold his conſent; and therefore in ſuch a caſe there is no ground for preſuming the heir's conſent to have been extorted from him. This hint leads us to a diſtinction in anſwering the foregoing queſtion. If the heir's conſent be voluntary, ſuch as he would have given in a ſtate of independence, it muſt be effectual both in law and equity to ſupport the deathbed-deed. If it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by fear of exheredation, it may be good at common law, but it will be voided by a court of equity.</p>
               <p>But this diſtinction, however clear in theory, ſeems to be not a little difficult in practice; for what criterion have we for judging in what caſes this conſent is voluntary, in what caſes extorted? The expiſcation may be intricate, but it is neceſſary. Where a man ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles his eſtate upon his eldeſt ſon with a reſerved power to alter even on deathbed, no rational man will willingly ſubmit to be in ſo preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a ſtate; and therefore the heir's conſent will be preſumed the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of extortion. On the other hand, where a man, ſettling his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate upon his eldeſt ſon, reſerves only power to burden it with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſum to his younger children, this is a fair ſettlement, by which the heir gets more than he gives; and therefore his conſent may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be preſumed voluntary. Hence in general, the heir's conſent to a reſerved power that bears hard upon him, will always be preſumed to have been extorted: his conſent, on the contrary, to a reſerved power that is proper and rational, will always be preſumed voluntary.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction gives me the greater ſatisfaction, when I find that it
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0743600300:344"/>
has had an influence upon the deciſions of the court of ſeſſion, though perhaps imperceptibly. A reſerved power to alter upon deathbed a diſpoſition granted to an eldeſt ſon, has in no inſtance been ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the heir's reduction, even where he accepted the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the exerciſe upon deathbed of a reſerved power that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and rational has generally been ſupported. Take the following examples. The exerciſe of a reſerved faculty to burden with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſum an eſtate diſponed to an heir, was ſuſtained, though the faculty was exerted upon deathbed <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, June 28. 1662, Hay contra Seton.

               <p>I ſhall cloſe this chapter with a ſeparate point, concerning powers given to a plurality, whether in exerciſing ſuch powers the whole muſt concur, or what number leſs than the whole may be ſufficient. If the perſons be named jointly, the will of the granter is clear, that the whole muſt concur, becauſe ſuch is the import of the word <hi>jointly.</hi> To ſay that any number leſs than the whole may be ſufficient, is in other words to ſay, that a nomination to act jointly is the ſame with a nomination to act ſeparately.</p>
               <p>But though all muſt concur, it follows not that they muſt all agree. If they be all preſent, the will of the maker naming them jointly is fulfilled; and what remains is, that the opinion of the majority muſt govern the whole body. <q rend="inline">"Celſus, lib. 2. Digeſtorum, ſcribit, Si in tres fuerit compromiſſum, ſufficere duorum conſenſum, ſi praeſens fuerit et tertius: alioquin, abſente eo, licet duo conſentiant, arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium non valere; quia in plures fuit compromiſſum, et potuit praeſentia ejus trahere eos in ejus ſententiam. Sicuti tribus judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus datis, quod duo ex conſenſu, abſente tertio, judicaverunt, nihil valet: quia id demum, quod major pars omnium judicavit, ratum eſt, cum et omnes judicaſſe palam eſt <note n="‡" place="bottom">l. 17. § 7. l. 18. De receptis qui arbitr.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next queſtion is, When a plurality are named without adding the term <hi>jointly,</hi> what is the legal import of ſuch nomination? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it underſtood the will of the maker that they muſt act jointly, or may act ſeparately? Stair<note n="‖" place="bottom">Book 1. tit. 12. § 13.</note> reſolves this queſtion by an argument not leſs plain than perſuaſive: <q rend="inline">"A mandate (ſays he) given to ten
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0743600300:345"/>
cannot be underſtood as given to a leſſer number. To give a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to Titius, Seius, and Maevius, cannot be the ſame with giving it to any two of them."</q> Hence it may be aſſumed as a rule at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, That a number of perſons named in one deed to act in the ſame affair, are underſtood to be named jointly where the contrary is not expreſſed.</p>
               <p>How far in this matter common law is ſubjected to the correction of equity, we next proceed to inquire. When a number of perſons are named <hi>jointly</hi> to perform any work, the whole muſt concur in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as well as at common law. For here the will is clearly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and a court of equity hath no power to vary from will. Thus two tutors being named <hi>jointly</hi> by a man to his heir, it was decreed, that the office was vacated by the death of one of them <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, Jan. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1671, Drummond contra Feuers of Bothkennar.</note>.</p>
               <p>A plurality named for carrying on any particular affair without the addition of <hi>jointly,</hi> affords a large field for equitable conſiderations. We have ſeen that at common law the term <hi>jointly</hi> is always implied or preſumed. But in particular caſes there are many circumſtances which a court of equity will lay hold of to overbalance this preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to reduce which under any general rule is ſearce practicable: circumſtances are ſeldom preciſely the ſame in any two caſes, and for that reaſon each caſe muſt be ruled by its own circumſtances. All that can be ſaid in general is, that the common law ought to take place, unleſs it can be clearly ſhown that the maker did not intend to confine his nominees to act jointly.</p>
               <p>Since general rules cannot be expected, what remains is to ſtate caſes the moſt oppoſed to each other, and which therefore admit of different conſiderations. And, in the firſt place, If I name a plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to perform any act that is to bind or affect me, equity as well as common law requires that the nominees act jointly. In caſes of that nature, there cannot readily occur any circumſtance to infer it to be my will that they may act ſeparately: for if any one of the nominees refuſe to accept, or die after acceptance, it is my privilege to make a ſecond nomination, or to forbear altogether; and it is not readily ſuppoſeable that any man will give away his privilege, unleſs it be ſo declared. Thus an award pronounced by two arbiters and an overſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man named by them, was declared void; becauſe it proceeded upon a ſubmiſſion to four arbiters who were impowered to name an overſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note n="†" place="bottom">Foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ainhall, Nov. 18. 1696, Watſon contra Miln.</note>. And when a plurality are conſtituted ſheriffs in that part by the court of ſeſſion, no ſentence can be pronounced by any of them
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0743600300:346"/>
without the reſt; becauſe (as the author expreſſes it) he being but one colleague joined to others, hath no power to pronounce ſentence without their conſent <note n="*" place="bottom">Balfour, (Of Judges), cap. 26.</note>. This holds in curators, becauſe they are elected by the minor himſelf: if any of them refuſe to accept, or die after acceptance, it is no hardſhip that the nomination ſhould be void, becauſe it is in the minor's power to renew the commiſſion. But where the curators named are many in number, it will ſcarce be held the minor's intention to adhere to the common law by confining them to act jointly. In this caſe it appears a more natural preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the purpoſe of naming ſo great a number was to provide againſt death or non-acceptance. And accordingly an act of curato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was ſuſtained, though ſeven only accepted of the eight that were named <note n="†" place="bottom">Hope, (Minor), March 11. 1612, Airth.</note>.

               <p>There is much greater latitude for interpretation of will with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to powers intended to be exerciſed after the granter's death. Stair explains this matter extremely well in the following words: <q rend="inline">"A mandate <hi>inter vivos</hi> giving power is ſtrictly to be interpreted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nominees failing, the power returns to the mandant. But power given by a man in contemplation of death cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and therefore he is preſumed to prefer all the perſons nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to any other that may fall by courſe of law <note n="‖" place="bottom">Book 1. tit. 12. § 13.</note>."</q> This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is finely illuſtrated by a nomination of tutors. Where they are named jointly, each muſt concur in every act, and conſequently the death or non-acceptance of any one voids the nomination; for ſuch is the meaning of a joint commiſſion to a plurality: but where a number of tutors are named without adding the term <hi>jointly,</hi> the tutory is ſupported by an equitable interpretation while any one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains alive: the preference given to them ſhows it to be the will of the deceaſed, that the adminiſtration ſhould be carried on by any one of the nominees rather than by the tutor-in-law. <q rend="inline">"For were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the more guardians are appointed for the ſecurity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, the leſs ſecure he would be, becauſe upon the death of any one of them the guardianſhip would be at an end <note n="**" place="bottom">New Abridg. of the law, vol. 2. p. 677.</note>."</q> Thus three tutors being named without ſpecifying <hi>conjunctly</hi> or <hi>ſeverally,</hi> and one only having accepted, it was decreed, that the whole office was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved

               <p>It is a very different caſe, where it is declared, that a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the tutors named, termed a <hi>quorum,</hi> muſt concur in every act: for if by death or non-acceptance the number be brought ſo low as not to make a <hi>quorum,</hi> it follows from the declared will of the maker, that the tutors exiſting cannot act; and therefore that the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is void. It is poſſible indeed, that the death or non-accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſo many as not to leave a <hi>quorum,</hi> may have been a <hi>caſus incogitatus</hi> which the maker would have provided for had he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the event. But this is altogether conjectural: and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it certain, yet here <hi>deficit voluntas;</hi> and in a deed which derives its obligatory force from will ſolely, without any other cauſe, it is beyond the reach of equity to ſupply the defect of will, which would land in making a will for a man who made none for himſelf. The ſame reaſoning is applicable to a nomination of tutors requiring expreſsly to every act the concurrence of one of them, termed a <hi>ſine quo non.</hi> And yet in ſeveral inſtances, ſo much has the court of ſeſſion been inflamed with what have been reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equitable conſiderations, that neither the failing of a <hi>quorum,</hi> nor even of the <hi>ſine quo non,</hi> were deemed ſufficient to void the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the court conjectured it to be the will of the deceaſed, to truſt any of the perſons named rather than the tutor-in-law <note n="‡" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Dec. 22. 1692, Watt contra Scrimzeour. Fountainhall, Feb. 22. 1693. Counteſs of Callender contra Earl of Linlithgow.</note>. But this ſtretch of equity was afterward corrected in the following caſe. In a nomination of tutors by a man to his children, his wife was named for one, and was ſo much diſtinguiſhed as to be declared <hi>ſine qua non.</hi> But ſhe by a ſecond marriage having rendered herſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the office, the queſtion occurred, Whether this incident did not void the nomination altogether? And the court declared the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination void <note n="‖" place="bottom">Fountainhall, June 24. 1703, Aikenhead contra Durham.</note>.</p>
               <p>But though with reſpect to a <hi>quorum,</hi> or a <hi>ſine quo non,</hi> the defect of will cannot be ſupplied, it is undoubtedly the privilege of a court of equity to ſupply any defect in words, in order to make the will effectual. Of this take the following curious inſtance. A gentleman
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0743600300:348"/>
having named his ſpouſe, his brother, and ſeveral others, to be tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and curators to his only child, <q rend="inline">"appointed, that of thoſe who ſhould accept, and ſurvive, the major part ſhould be a <hi>quorum;</hi> that his ſpouſe ſhould be <hi>ſine qua non;</hi> and in caſe of her death or incapacity, his brother; but that by the death or incapacity of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the tutory and curatory ſhould not be diſſolved, but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with the other perſons named, as long as any one of them remained alive."</q> The only event omitted to be provided for was that which happened, <hi>viz.</hi> the widow's refuſal to undertake the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which brought on the queſtion before the court of ſeſſion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nomination could notwithſtanding ſubſiſt; or, Whether it was void to make way for the tutor-in-law. The court unanimouſly held it undoubted law, the above mentioned deciſions notwithſtanding, that the failure of any one of a plurality of tutors named jointly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinges the nomination, and ſtill more the failure of that perſon who is named <hi>ſine quo non,</hi> or the failure of a <hi>quorum:</hi> but, in the preſent caſe, that it appeared the intention of the father to continue his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination as long as any of the perſons named ſhould exiſt; that this is expreſſed in clear terms with reſpect to the death or incapacity of the <hi>ſine quibus non;</hi> and that the ſame muſt be underſtood his will in the caſe of their non-acceptance, becauſe the caſes are ſo parallel, as that no man could think of making a difference; and conſequently that here there is no defect of will, but of words only, occaſioned by the careleſſneſs or inaccuracy of the writer. The nomination accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly was decreed to ſubſiſt <note n="*" place="bottom">June 16. 1742, Dalrymple of Drummore contra Mrs Iſabel Somervell.</note>.</p>
               <p>I proceed to examples of a different kind. A man having left 2500 merks to his children, impowered four friends named to divide the ſame among the children. After the death of one of the four, a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made by the three ſurvivors was not ſuſtained, and the children accordingly were decreed to have each of them an equal ſhare <note n="†" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Feb. 10. 1693, Moir contra Grier.</note>. Here the four being named in the ſame deed, and to concur in the ſame act, were underſtood to be named jointly; and as there was no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to infer that the granter intended to impower any number leſs than the whole to make the diviſion, there could be no reaſon for varying from the rule of common law.</p>
               <p>Helen Cuningham left 4000 merks to her grandchildren, to be employed for their behoof at the ſight of five perſons named, of which number their father and mother were two. This ſum was lent
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0743600300:349"/>
out with the approbation of all, including the father and mother, one of the nominees excepted, who was abroad at the time. The ultimate purpoſe of this ſettlement was evidently to ſecure the grandchildren in the ſum ſettled upon them; and if this was done by lending the money to a perſon of unexceptionable credit at the time, the granter's will and purpoſe was fulfilled. By naming ſo many perſons, he made it eaſy for the executor to get the approbation of a ſufficient number; and it could not be his intention to require rigidly the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of every perſon named. And yet the court, adhering to the words as a court of common law, found that the money was not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd as it ought to have been, and therefore decreed the executor to be liable <note n="*" place="bottom">Spotiſwoode, (Legacy), Feb. 13. 1624, Hunters contra Executors of Macmichael.</note>.</p>

               <p>A COURT of equity not only varies from common law in order to fulfil the great principles of juſtice and utility, but countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſuch variations in the conduct of individuals. The preſent chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is intended as an illuſtration of this doctrine; for ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples will be given, of ſupporting poſitive infringements of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law done even by its own officers.</p>
               <p>The legal authority of magiſtrates and officers of the law being
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0743600300:350"/>
territorial, is confined within preciſe limits. In ſtrict reaſoning, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be pronounced with greater certainty, than that an officer of the law acting beyond the bounds of his commiſſion, acts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out authority: and yet in practice we admit ſeveral exceptions from this rule. If goods once apprehended in order to be poinded, be drove out of the ſheriffdom purpoſely to diſappoint the poinding, it is lawful for the officer to follow and complete his poinding, in the ſame manner as if the goods had not been drove away <note n="*" place="bottom">Balfour, (Poinding), March 22. 1560, Home contra Sheill.</note>. By the ſtatute 52. Henry III. cap. 15. <q rend="inline">"No man for any manner of cauſe can take a diſtreſs out of his fee, or in the king's highway:"</q> but if the lord coming to diſtrain have the view of the beaſts within his fee, and before he can diſtrain them the tenant chaſes them into the highway, it hath been found, that the lord, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſtatute, may diſtrain them there <note n="†" place="bottom">Abridg. of the law, vol. 2. p. 111.</note>. With regard to the power of apprehending delinquents, one inſtruction is, That if a delinquent fly without the bounds of a conſtable's charge, the conſtable, being in hot purſuit, may follow and apprehend him <note n="‡" place="bottom">Act 8. parl. 1617. Act 38. parl. 1661.</note>. And, by the ſame rule, a ſtranger committing a riot within a baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, may, by the officers of the barony, be purſued and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the barony <note n="‖" place="bottom">Nicolſon, (Forum competens), Jan 8. 1661, Baillie contra Lord Torphichen.</note>.</p>
               <p>Sir Matthew Hale, in his hiſtory of the pleas of the crown <note n="**" place="bottom">Vol. 2. p. 115.</note>, handles this matter with care, and traces it through various caſes. <q rend="inline">"If a warrant or precept to arreſt a felon come to an officer or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the felon be arreſted, and after arreſt eſcape into another county, yet he may be purſued and taken upon freſh purſuit, and brought before the juſtice of the county where the warrant iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; for the law adjudged him always in the officer's cuſtody by virtue of the firſt arreſt. But if he eſcape before arreſt into another county, if it be a warrant barely for a miſdemeanour, it ſeems the officer cannot purſue him into another county; becauſe out of the juriſdiction of the juſtice who granted the warrant. But in caſe of felony, affray, or dangerous wounding, the officer may purſue him, and uſe hue and cry upon him into any county. But if he take him in a foreign county, he is to bring him to the gaol or juſtice of that county where he is taken. For he doth not take him pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the warrant of the juſtice, but by the authority that the law gives him; and the juſtice's warrant is a ſufficient cauſe of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0743600300:351"/>
ſuſpicion and purſuit."</q> Here ſeveral caſes are diſtinguiſhed, and different degrees of power indulged to the officer, all of them flatly contradictory to the ſtrict rules of common law: and yet we chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acquieſce in the doctrine, becauſe our hearts dictate to us that it is juſt and ſalutary.</p>
               <p>Let us examine what will the moſt readily occur in reflecting upon this ſubject. If a felon be once arreſted and in the hands of the officer, a notion of property ariſes, and ſuggeſts a right ſimilar to that of the firſt occupant of land. Though the felon eſcape, the officer, in freſh purſuit, is underſtood to retain a ſort of poſſeſſion <hi>animo,</hi> intitling him to purſue the felon till he compaſs his aim, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſecond arreſt. We naturally conclude, that the felon, being in ſome ſenſe the property of the officer, may be ſeized where-ever he can be found; and, by virtue of that <hi>quaſi</hi> property, may be carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judge who granted the warrant. This reaſoning will appear ſtill more ſatisfactory when it is applied to the caſe cited above from Balfour, where a poinding is inchoated by apprehenſion of the goods; a circumſtance which undoubtedly produces ſome faint no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of property in the goods, intitling the poinder to ſeize them where-ever found.</p>
               <p>Again, <q rend="inline">"where a felon eſcapes without being arreſted, if the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant be barely for a miſdemeanour, it ſeems the officer cannot purſue him into another county. But in caſe of felony, affray, or dangerous wounding, the officer may purſue him into another county."</q> Here is a diſtinction made which appears to have a foundation in human nature. As this diſtinction cannot ariſe from the nature of the warrant, which is not more extenſive in the one caſe than in the other, it muſt ariſe from the nature of the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency. Felony, or any capital crime, inflames the mind, and creates a ſtrong deſire of puniſhment: the heated imagination is hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along, and cannot be reſtrained by the ſlight fetters of ſtrict form. And accordingly, in weighing an abſtract principle againſt the impulſe of an honeſt paſſion, the mind, which feels the prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derancy of the latter, naturally embraces the following ſentiment, That the officer in this caſe ought not to be confined within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of his commiſſion. In the caſe of a ſlight miſdemeanour, the reſult is different. Strict principles have a ſtronger effect upon the mind than any impulſe that can ariſe from a venial tranſgreſſion; and therefore, in judging of this caſe, the mind naturally reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the limitation of the warrant.</p>
               <p>And what is further mentioned in the foregoing quotation, will
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0743600300:352"/>
ſupport theſe reflections. <q rend="inline">"A delinquent once arreſted, may, upon a ſecond arreſt, be brought from another county to the judge who gave the warrant. But if arreſted for the firſt time in a foreign county, the criminal muſt be carried before the judge of the county where he is taken."</q> The diſtinction here made, ariſes from the ſame principles that are above explained. It has already been obſerved, that the notion of a <hi>quaſi</hi> property ſupplies the want of a ſecond warrant. But an arreſt for the firſt time in a foreign county muſt be governed by a different rule: the mind figuring a hot purſuit of the criminal, eaſily ſurmounts any obſtruction that may ariſe from mere form; but ſo ſoon as the end is gained by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the felon in ſafe cuſtody, the impulſe of paſſion being over, the mind ſubſides; and in this condition, perceiving the defect of power, it takes the firſt opportunity of ſupplying the defect, by an application to the judge of the place <note n="a" place="bottom">This form is now rendered unneceſſary by act 24<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Geo. II. cap. 55. If a perſon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a warrant indorſed, be apprehended in another county for an offence not bailable, or if he ſhall not find bail, he ſhall be carried back into the firſt county, and be committed by the juſtices in that county, or be bailed there if the crime be bailable.</note>.</p>
               <p>And with reſpect to the two caſes now mentioned, a remarkable difference is obſervable in the operations of the mind. However ſtrong the impulſe of a paſſion may be when it agitates the mind, yet as ſoon as it ſubſides by gratification, the mind is left free to the government of reaſon. Thus when a felon who was never arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is purſued into a foreign county, the defect of power is ſcarce perceived during the heat of purſuit: but immediately upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the defect of power makes an impreſſion; and reaſon demands that the defect be forthwith ſupplied. The mind is differently influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the caſe of an eſcape after arreſt. If once a reſemblance be diſcovered between two objects, there is a natural propenſity to make the reſemblance as complete as poſſible; which in reaſoning produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces an error extremely common, <hi>viz.</hi> that of drawing the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as if the reſemblance were altogether complete. Thus by getting poſſeſſion of the body of a felon, a faint notion of property being ſuggeſted, the mind proceeds, without heſitation, to form all its concluſions as if the felon were truly the property of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</p>
               <p>It is extremely curious to obſerve, how men ſometimes are influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by principles and emotions that they themſelves at the time ſcarce attend to; which is remarkable in writers upon law, who, little apt to regard the ſilent operations of the mind, are not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0743600300:353"/>
unleſs for every regulation they can aſſign a reaſon in ſtrict law. This proceeds from ſtudying law too much as an abſtract ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without conſidering, that all its regulations ought to be founded upon human nature, and be adapted to the various opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind. If one of the greateſt lawyers in modern times furniſh this cenſure, few can hope to eſcape. And that the cenſure is juſt, will appear from conſidering the reaſoning of our author, which is by no means ſatisfactory. With regard to the felon who has been once arreſted, he aſſigns the following reaſon for the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <q rend="inline">"That the law adjudgeth him always in the officer's cuſtody by virtue of the firſt arreſt."</q> But why does the law give this judgment, when it is contrary to the fact? This queſtion ought to have been prevented in accurate reaſoning: inſtead of which we are left in the dark, preciſely where light is the moſt wanted. The true anſwer to this queſtion is given above, <hi>viz.</hi> that the right of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion once fairly acquired, cannot be loſt by ſtealth or force, and therefore is retained <hi>animo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the other branch, the reaſoning appears ſtill more lame. The caſe is of a felon apprehended for the firſt time out of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; upon which our author's reaſoning is, <q rend="inline">"That the officer doth not act purely by the warrant of the juſtice, but by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the law gives him; and that the juſtice's warrant is a ſufficient cauſe of ſuſpicion and purſuit."</q> This is extremely obſcure, and unſatisfactory ſo far as intelligible. In the firſt place, it is obvious, that the reaſoning, if juſt, is equally applicable what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the nature of the crime: the juſtice's warrant is not more a ſufficient cauſe of ſuſpicion and purſuit where the crime is atrocious, than where it is of the ſlighteſt kind. In the next place, ſuppoſing the juſtice's warrant to be a ſufficient cauſe of ſuſpicion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of purſuit, the perſon upon whoſe information the warrant was iſſued has a better cauſe of ſuſpicion, and yet the law impowers not that perſon to apprehend nor to purſue. Neither doth a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of ſuſpicion give authority to an officer of the law out of the juriſdiction, more than to a private perſon. But let a man having authority to apprehend be figured in hot purſuit of a noted criminal, the mind forthwith interpoſes, and hurries him on till he reach his quarry where-ever found: no ſuch impreſſion is made by the ſlighter tranſgreſſions. And this difference of feeling, is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our author's doctrine; a difference that undoubtedly he was ſenſible of, though he has not been ſo lucky as to put it in a clear light.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0743600300:354"/>
Thus we have endeavoured to trace out the foundation of ſeveral nice concluſions in law, that depend not on abſtract reaſoning, but on ſentiment. In one of the caſes, an imagined right over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a felon arreſted, ſuggeſted by a ſlight reſemblance it hath to property, is in reality the only foundation of our conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In the other, what in reality determines us, is the anxiety we have to prevent the felon's eſcape. And whoever examines laws and deciſions with due attention, will find many of them found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on impreſſions or emotions, ſtill more ſlight than thoſe above mentioned.</p>
               <p>To complete the ſubject, nothing further ſeems neceſſary but to obſerve, that the foregoing principles and operations of the mind, are countenanced by courts of juſtice, even ſo far as upon their account to diſpenſe with the cleareſt rules of law. Theſe principles and operations merit regard as virtuous and laudable; but their merit chiefly depends on their utility. By overcoming that ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous nicety of law, which often is an impediment to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice, they tend in an eminent degree to the good of ſociety.</p>

Men, allured by huſbandry, having relinquiſhed the wandering ſtate for a ſettled habitation, were by this revolution brought under new rules of law. The laws of a tribe or clan, governed originally each individual belonging to it, without relation to place <note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical Law-tracts, tract 6.</note>. But after na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions became ſtationary, place became the capital circumſtance. Laws were made to regulate all matters at home, that is, within the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſtate; and legiſlators extended not their view to what was done or ſuffered in a foreign country, whether by their own people or by ſtrangers. Thus laws, originally <hi>perſonal,</hi> became ſtrictly <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorial;</hi> and hence the eſtabliſhed maxim, That law hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>extra territorium.</hi> This confined notion of law correſponded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well to the manners of early times: mutual fear and diffidence, in days of barbarity, prevented all intercourſe among nations; and individuals, having no temptation to go abroad, ſeldom ventured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their own territory. But regular government introduced more ſocial manners; the appetite for riches unfolded itſelf, and individuals were put in motion to ſeek gain where the proſpect was faireſt: in moſt countries accordingly, there are found many foreigners, who have an occaſional reſidence there for the ſake of commerce. This change of manners diſcovered the imperfection of territorial laws: a man, by retiring abroad, is ſecure againſt a proſecution, civil or criminal, for what he has done at home; and by returning home, he is ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a proſecution for what he has done abroad: common law reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no perſon but who is actually within the territory of the ſtate; and reacheth no cauſe of action but what happens within the ſame territory <note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſtorical Law-tracts, tract 7.</note>.</p>
               <p>The common law of England is ſtrictly territorial in the ſenſe above deſcribed <note n="‡" place="bottom">See Statute law of Scotland abridged, note 7.</note>: nor have we reaſon to believe that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of Scotland was more extenſive. When therefore the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going defect came to be diſcovered, it was neceſſary to provide a remedy; and the remedy was, to bring foreign matters under juriſdiction of the King and council; to which originally, as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount court, all extraordinary matters were appropriated. In Scotland particularly, the act 105. parl. 1487, declares the King and council to be the only court for <hi>the actions of ſtrangers of other realms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With reſpect to foreign matters, the juriſdiction of the King and council in both kingdoms, was diſtinguiſhed from that of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0743600300:356"/>
courts of law in two particulars. Firſt, The juriſdiction of the latter was territorial with reſpect to cauſes as well as with reſpect to perſons: the juriſdiction of the former was indeed territorial with reſpect to perſons, no perſon in foreign parts being ſubjected to the juriſdiction; but with reſpect to cauſes, it was the oppoſite to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorial, no cauſe but what happened in foreign parts being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent. Next, the ordinary courts are confined to common law: but with reſpect to foreign matters this law can be no rule, for the reaſon above given, that it regulates nothing <hi>extra territorium.</hi> The King and council accordingly judging of foreign matters, could not be governed by the common law of any country: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of <hi>Britain</hi> regulates not foreign matters; and the law of a foreign country hath no authority here. Whence it follows, that foreign matters muſt be governed by the rules of common ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to which all men are ſubjected, or <hi>jure gentium,</hi> as generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>This extraordinary juriſdiction concerning foreign matters, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned originally in both kingdoms to the ſame court, is now exerciſed very differently in the two kingdoms. In Scotland, it was derived by intermediate ſteps from the King and council to the court of ſeſſion: and accordingly, by the regulations laid down ſoon after the inſtitution of that court, a juriſdiction is beſtow'd upon it as to foreign matters, and the actions of foreigners are privileged <note n="*" place="bottom">Act 45. parl. 1537.</note>. In England, this extraordinary juriſdiction made a different progreſs. The extenſive territories poſſeſſed by the Engliſh Kings in France, and the great reſort of Engliſhmen there, occaſioned numberleſs law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits before the King and council. To relieve that court from an oppreſſive load of buſineſs, the conſtable and marſhal court was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted; and to this new court were appropriated foreign matters, to be tried <hi>jure gentium</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See Duck de authoritate juris Civilis, lib. 2. cap. 8. part 3. § 15. &amp;c.</note>. After the Engliſh conqueſts in France were wreſted from them, this court had very little buſineſs. We find ſcattered inſtances of its acting as a criminal court, down to the reign of Charles II.; but none for centuries before of its acting as a civil court. The court of chancery, with reſpect to its power of ſupplying the defects and mitigating the rigor of common law, had ſucceeded to the King and council; and it would have been a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural meaſure to transfer to the ſame court the extraordinary juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction under conſideration, the rule of judging being the ſame in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0743600300:357"/>
both. But the court of chancery being at that time in its infancy, and its privilege as to all extraordinary matters not being clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, the courts of common law, by an artifice or fiction, aſſumed foreign matters to themſelves. The cauſe of action is feigned to have exiſted in England <note n="*" place="bottom">See Duck de authoritate juris Civilis, lib. 2. cap. 8. part 3. § 18.</note>, and the defendant is not ſuffered to traverſe this allegation. This may be juſtly conſidered as an uſurpation of the courts of common law upon the court of chancery, which, like moſt uſurpations, has occaſioned very irregular conſequences. I ſhall not inſiſt upon the ſtrange irregularity of aſſuming a juriſdiction upon no better foundation than an abſolute falſehood. It is more material to obſerve, that foreign matters ought to be tried <hi>june gentium,</hi> and yet that the judges who uſurp this juriſdiction have no power to try any cauſe otherwiſe than by the common law of England. What can be expected from ſuch inconſiſtency but injuſtice in every inſtance? Lucky it is for Scotland, that chance, perhaps more than good policy, hath appropriated foreign matters to the court of ſeſſion, where they can be decided on rational principles, without being abſurdly fettered, as in England, by common law.</p>
               <p>To form a diſtinct notion of the foregoing extraordinary juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the court of ſeſſion with reſpect to foreign matters, it may be proper to ſtate ſuccinctly its different juriſdictions, and to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the bounds of each. Conſidered as a court of common law, thoſe actions only belong to it where the cauſe of action did ariſe within Scotland. With regard to perſons, this court was originally limited like the courts of common law in England: it had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over any man but during the time he was locally in Scotland. But in this reſpect the court hath in later times acquired, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, an enlargement of juriſdiction: every Scotchman, even in foreign parts, is ſubjected to the juriſdiction of the court; and, by a citation at the market-croſs of Edinburgh, pier and ſhore of Leith, may be called to defend in any action before the court <note n="†" place="bottom">See Statute-law of Scotland abridged, note 7.</note>. In the next place, conſidering this court as a court of equity, impowered to ſupply the defects and mitigate the rigor of common law, its juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is and muſt be the ſame with what it enjoys as a court of common law. To give it a more extenſive juriſdiction would be uſeleſs; and to confine it within narrower bounds would not fully anſwer the end of its inſtitution, which is to redreſs common law when juſtice demands redreſs. In the laſt place, this court, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0743600300:358"/>
to foreign matters, has the ſame juriſdiction over perſons that it has as a court of common law or of equity. And accordingly the court had no difficulty to ſuſtain a proceſs for payment of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count contracted at Campvere in Zealand, though the defendant, a Scotch merchant reſiding there, was not in this country any time du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſuit <note n="*" place="bottom">June 27. 1760, Hog contra Tennent.</note>.</p>
               <p>The rules that govern the ſeſſion as a court for foreign matters, are the ſame that govern it as a court of equity; for theſe rules are derived from the principles of juſtice. But it muſt not be held that theſe rules are applied preciſely in the ſame manner: as a court of equity, the ſeſſion will not venture to interpoſe againſt common law, unleſs authoriſed by ſome general rule of equity that is applicable to all caſes of the kind; but as to foreign matters, which belong not to common law, every caſe muſt be judged upon its own merits. And therefore the court here is leſs under reſtraint, than in ſupplying the defects of common law, or in correcting its rigor.</p>
               <p>Though with reſpect to foreign matters, there is, ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but one rule for judging, <hi>viz.</hi> equity, or natural juſtice; yet this rule, in its application to different matters, brings out very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent concluſions. And ſhould one undertake to unfold all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious caſes to which the rule may be applied, the work would be endleſs. Avoiding therefore this laborious taſk, I propoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my ſpeculations to ſome few leading caſes that have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the court of ſeſſion; and theſe, for the ſake of perſpicuity, ſhall be diſtributed into ſeveral claſſes.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I. Actions ſtrictly perſonal founded on foreign covenants, deeds, or facts.</head>
                  <p>UPon the principles above laid down there can be no doubt, that a foreign covenant will produce an action here, provided the party bound by the covenant, whether a native or a foreigner, be found in Scotland. It would be a great defect in law, were there no redreſs againſt a foreigner who retires with his effects to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in order to ſcreen himſelf from debts contracted at home. And yet the court of ſeſſion refuſed to ſuſtain an action brought by one foreigner againſt another for payment of debt contracted abroad; giving for a reaſon, that the parties were here occaſionally only,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0743600300:359"/>
and that the debtor having no domicil in Scotland, was not ſubjected to the juriſdiction of this court<note n="*" place="bottom">Haddington, Nov. 23. 1610. Vernor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Elvies.</note> This was in effect declaring, that the court of ſeſſion is a court of common law only, having no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege to cognoſce of foreign tranſactions; a ſtrange miſtake, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the regulation above mentioned, acknowledging a juriſdiction in this court as to foreign matters.</p>
                  <p>When a foreign bond ſtipulating the intereſt of the country where granted, is made the foundation of a proceſs here, it has been doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether that intereſt or the legal intereſt of this country ought to be decreed. This doubt is eaſily ſolved. An agreement to pay the intereſt of the country where the money is borrowed, is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly binding in conſcience, and therefore ought to be made effectual in every country. Nor do we meet with any obſtruction in the Scotch ſtatutes regulating the intereſt of money, which are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reach foreign intereſt. And this accordingly is the rule in the law of England <note n="†" place="bottom">Abridg. caſes in equity, ch. 36. ſect. E. § 1.</note>. Hence it appears, that the court of ſeſſion erred in refuſing the intereſt of 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> upon a double bond exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in Ireland, and in reſtricting the penal part of the bond to 6 <hi>per cent.</hi> the legal intereſt here <note n="‡" place="bottom">Fountainhall, Jan. 27. 1710, Savage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Craig.</note>. This error will be not leſs evident from another conſideration. The penalty of a double bond put in ſuit here, ought to be ſuſtained to the extent of damage and coſts of ſuit: but the damage is plainly the intereſt of the country where the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is lent; becauſe had payment been duly made, the money again lent out would have produced that intereſt. For the ſame reaſon, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the rate of intereſt to be lower in England than here, our judges, in relieving from the penalty in a double bond, will make the Engliſh intereſt the rule; for the lender could not have a view to greater intereſt than that of his own country.</p>
                  <p>The caſe is different where intereſt is ſtipulated greater than is permitted in the <hi>locus contractus.</hi> Such ſtipulation is uſury in that country, and a moral wrong every where: I ſay a moral wrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as every man is bound to give obedience to the laws of his own country, it is a moral wrong to tranſgreſs theſe laws <note n="‖" place="bottom">See p. 179.</note>. When action therefore is brought in a foreign country for payment of the ſtipulated intereſt, it would be contrary to the rules of juſtice to ſuſtain a claim that is founded on an immoral paction; and the judge
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0743600300:360"/>
who ſhould ſuſtain action in that caſe would be acceſſory to the wrong. But now, admitting that the intereſt ſtipulated ought not to be ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it comes next to be conſidered, whether the intereſt of the <hi>locus contractus</hi> ſhould be the rule, or that of the country where the action is brought, or laſtly, whether intereſt ſhould be rejected altogether. This is a puzzling queſtion. One at firſt view will naturally reject intereſt altogether, as a juſt puniſhment of the wrong done. But it is not clear that a judge can puniſh for a wrong committed in a foreign country. One thing indeed is clear, that action cannot be ſuſtained upon the immoral ſtipulation; and therefore, if there be any claim for intereſt, it muſt be <hi>nomine damni</hi> only. This leads the mind to the intereſt of the <hi>locus contractus;</hi> and I incline to be of opinion that that intereſt is due.</p>
                  <p>Under the head of covenants comes properly marriage celebrated abroad. The municipal law of Scotland, regulating the ſolemnities of marriage, reſpects no marriage but what is made in Scotland: and as foreign laws have no coercive authority here, nothing is left for determining the validity of ſuch a marriage but the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. According to that law the matrimonial connection is founded upon conſent ſolely; and the various ſolemnities required by the laws of different nations have all of them the ſame aim, <hi>viz.</hi> to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify conſent in the moſt complete manner. In this view, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of the country where a marriage is celebrated, ought with us to have the greateſt weight; becauſe they evidently ſhow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate will and purpoſe of the parties. On the other hand, juſtice requires that a marriage be held good here, though not formal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of the country where it was made, provided the will and purpoſe of the parties to unite in marriage clearly appear.</p>
                  <p>According to the doctrine here laid down, a child ought with us to be held legitimate by a ſubſequent marriage, provided the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-ceremony was performed in a country where ſuch is the law; becauſe marriage in ſuch a country muſt import the will of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to legitimate his baſtard children. But we cannot juſtly give the ſame effect to a marriage celebrated in a country where the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as in England, hath not the effect of legitimation. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that marriage in ſuch a caſe is not a proof of the father's will to legitimate.</p>
                  <p>A minor in the choice he makes of curators is not confined to the inhabitants of his own country; and therefore a foreigner choſen curator has the ſame authority here with a native. Neither is it
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0743600300:361"/>
of importance in what place curators be choſen; and accordingly a choice made in England of curators, whether Engliſh or Scotch, will be effectual here. The powers of a guardian to a lunatic in England are more limited. The cuſtody of the perſon of an Engliſh lunatic and the management of his land-eſtate in England belong to the court of chancery; and the chancellor names one guardian to the perſon, another to the eſtate. But the chancellor having no power over a lunatic's land in Scotland, cannot appoint a guardian to manage ſuch land.</p>
                  <p>Having diſcuſſed civil matters, I proceed to criminal. A crime committed at ſea may be tried by the court of admiralty: but, this caſe excepted, no crime committed in a foreign country can be tried in Scotland. The juriſdiction of the juſticiary-court is ſtrictly terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial, being confined within the limits of Scotland; and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary juriſdiction of the court of ſeſſion with reſpect to foreign matters, reaches civil cauſes only. Nor is it neceſſary that it ſhould be extended to crimes. It is of great importance to every nation that juſtice have a free courſe every where; and to this end it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that in every country there be an extraordinary juriſdiction for foreign matters, as far as juſtice is concerned. But there is not the ſame neceſſity for an extraordinary juriſdiction to puniſh foreign delinquencies: the proper place for puniſhment is where the crime is committed; and no ſociety takes concern in any crime but what is hurtful to itſelf. A claim for reparation ariſing from a foreign delinquency, ſtands upon a different footing: being founded on the rules of common juſtice, it is a claim that undoubtedly belongs to the juriſdiction under conſideration. No man who injures another ought to reckon himſelf ſecure any where till he make reparation; and if he be obſtinate or refractory, juſtice requires that he be compelled, where-ever found, to make reparation.</p>
                  <p>To ſecure the effects of the deceaſed from embezzlement, every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who intermeddles irregularly is, in Scotland, ſubjected to the whole debts of the deceaſed, without limitation. This penal paſſive title, termed <hi>vicious intromiſſion,</hi> is confined to irregular intermeddling within Scotland. The intermeddling in England with the moveable effects of a Scotchman who dies there, muſt be judged by the rules of natural juſtice; and therefore in this country cannot infer any concluſion beyond reſtitution or damages.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. Foreign covenants and deeds reſpecting land.</head>
                  <p>IN order to have a diſtinct conception of this branch, the extent of our own municipal law with reſpect to land in Scotland muſt be aſcertained; for we are not at liberty to apply the <hi>jus gentium,</hi> or the principles of natural juſtice, to any caſe that comes under our own law. As to this preliminary point, things it is certain as well as perſons are governed by municipal law, and ſubjected to the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of courts of law. Land in particular, next to perſons, is the greateſt object of law; and in every country the acquiſition and tranſmiſſion of land are regulated by municipal law. Our law, for example, with reſpect to the tranſmiſſion of land-property, requires writings in a peculiar form. Such writings are held a good title of property, whether executed at home or abroad. Writings, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, in a form different from that preſcribed by our law, will be diſregarded where-ever executed; for our law regards the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties only, not the place. Thus a teſtament made in England, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing land in Scotland, is not ſuſtained by the court of ſeſſion; becauſe, by our law, no man can diſpoſe of his land by teſtament: nor will it be regarded that land is teſtable in England; becauſe every thing concerning land in Scotland is regulated by our law. In general, the connection of a land-eſtate with the territory where ſituated, is of the moſt intimate kind: it bears the relation of a part to the whole. Thus every legal act concerning land, the conveying it <hi>inter vivos,</hi> the tranſmitting it from the dead to the living, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity granted on it for debt, are aſcertained by the municipal law of every country; and with reſpect to every particular of that kind, our courts are tied down to their own law.</p>
                  <p>Are we then to hold, that a conveyance of land in a form differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from what is required by us can have no effect? Suppoſe a man ſells in England his land-eſtate in Scotland, executes a deed of conveyance in the Engliſh form, and perhaps receives payment of the price: ſuch conveyance, not being in the form required by the law of Scotland, will not have the effect to transfer the property. But has the purchaſer any claim in Scotland againſt the vender? None at common law; becauſe a court of common law hath not authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to transform an actual diſpoſition into an obligation to diſpone.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0743600300:363"/>
But ſuch claim is ſupported in equity; becauſe where a man, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to transfer his land to a purchaſer, executes a diſpoſition which is afterward diſcovered to be imperfect, it is his duty to execute one more formal; and if he be refractory, it is the duty of a court of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to compel him, or to ſupply his place. If the action be laid within the territory where the land is ſituated, the judge, in default of the diſponer, may adjudge the land to the plaintiff: if in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther territory, all that can enſue is damage for not performance. I illuſtrate this doctrine by a ſimilar caſe. A diſpoſition of land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Scotland without procuratory or precept, will not be regarded at common law: but a court of equity, attentive to juſtice, will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in behalf of the purchaſer, by adjudging the land to him. Thus with reſpect to an informal conveyance of land within Scotland, the ſeſſion acts as a court of equity; and it acts as an extraordinary court for foreign matters where a conveyance is executed abroad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of the place.</p>
                  <p>A covenant was executed in England between two brothers, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that failing children the eſtate of the deceaſed ſhould go to the ſurvivor. The brother who firſt deceaſed had a land-eſtate in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, a part of which he had gratuitouſly aliened in defraud of the covenant. A reduction was brought of this gratuitous deed by the ſurviving brother, and the covenant was ſuſtained as a good title in the reduction. The covenant, though it had not the formalities of the law of Scotland, was however good evidence of the agreement between the brothers; and as the deceaſed brother had done a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wrong in tranſgreſſing the agreement, juſtice required that the wrong ſhould be redreſſed, which was done by voiding the gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deed <note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes, July 5. 1706, Cuningham contra Lady Sempill.</note>. But in a later caſe, the court deviated widely from the foregoing principle of juſtice. A diſpoſition of an heritable juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scotland, executed in England according to the Engliſh form, was not ſuſtained even againſt the granter, to compel him to execute a more formal diſpoſition <note n="†" place="bottom">February 1729, Earl Dalkeith contra Book.</note>. This was acting as a court of common law. And it muſt not paſs unobſerved, that the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating different juriſdictions in the ſame court, occaſions frequently miſtakes of this nature; which are avoided in countries where differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent juriſdictions are preſerved diſtinct in different courts.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. Foreign covenants and deeds reſpecting moveables.</head>
                  <p>MOveables as well as immoveables have a local ſituation; and it is a propoſition acknowledged by all our lawyers, That Scotch moveables as well as Scotch land are regulated by our municipal law. Thus though an executor may be named by a nuncupative will in England, yet ſuch will is never ſuſtained to carry moveables in Scotland, becauſe writ with us is an eſſential ſolemnity in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of an executor <note n="*" place="bottom">Stair, Gilmour, Newbyth, January 19. 1665, Shaw contra Lewis.</note>. In England again, a baſtard enjoys the privilege of making a teſtament, which privilege is denied to a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard here. And therefore, notwithſtanding a teſtament made by a baſtard in England, his effects here were eſcheated to the crown <note n="†" place="bottom">Haddington, February 1. 1611, Purves contra Chiſholm.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The application of the foregoing rule to land is abundantly eaſy, in Europe at leaſt, where the marches of different kingdoms and territories are aſcertained with preciſion. But the ſlight connection that moveables have with the place where they are found, makes it often a difficult problem to aſcertain the country they belong to. And yet the ſolution of this problem is neceſſary with reſpect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny queſtions concerning them, ſuch as the right of ſucceſſion, the manner of tranſmiſſion from the dead to the living, and from the living to the living. All queſtions of this kind are regulated by the law of the country to which theſe moveables properly belong; for it would be too precarious a rule, to conſider them as belonging to the country where they happen to be, occaſionally or accidentally: if a foreigner, for example, happen to die here with valuable move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables about him, it will not be thought reaſonable that theſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables ſhould be given to thoſe who would be his next of kin accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law of Scotland, when his next of kin according to the law of his own country are different, and when theſe next of kin will take the effects he left at home. The local ſituation of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables is attended with ſuch variety of circumſtances that it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to bring all of them under general rules. It is neceſſary howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to make an attempt; and the following rules may, I preſume, exhauſt the bulk of theſe circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, moveables belonging to a Scotchman, and local<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0743600300:365"/>
in Scotland, are deemed Scotch effects, to be regulated by the law of Scotland. Nor will it vary the caſe that the proprietor happens to be occaſionally abroad <hi>non animo remanendi:</hi> an aſſignment made by him there according to the <hi>lex loci,</hi> will not transfer theſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables to the aſſignee. But according to what is ſaid above with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to land, it will intitle the aſſignee to demand from the court of ſeſſion that the moveables be adjudged to him; or to demand da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, unleſs the cedent be willing to grant a more formal aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Next, if the proprietor happen to die abroad, his ſucceſſion will be regulated by the law of Scotland, as alſo the form of making up titles. The connection with his own country continues entire in the mind of every perſon, and all matters are determined in the ſame manner as if he had died at home. That this is the common ſenſe of mankind is teſtified by good authority, <hi>viz.</hi> act 88. parl. 1426, injoining, <q rend="inline">"That where a Scotchman dies abroad occaſionally, <hi>non animo remanendi,</hi> his Scotch effects muſt be confirmed in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moveables, on the other hand, occaſionally in Scotland, belonging to a foreigner, are held to be foreign effects, not regulated by the law of this country: the occaſional connection with this country, yields to the more intimate connection with the proprietor, who is a foreigner. For this reaſon, a foreign aſſignment of ſuch moveables, formal according to the <hi>lex loci,</hi> will be ſuſtained by the court of ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion acting as judges in foreign matters. And, for the ſame reaſon, an executor named by the proprietor will have a good claim to ſuch moveables, provided he complete his title <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem loci.</hi> And even though the proprietor, here occaſionally, fall ſick and die, the court of ſeſſion will prefer thoſe who are next of kin according to the law of his country; and if he be an Engliſhman, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, will ſuſtain letters of adminiſtration from the prerogative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court as the proper title. In like manner, if a Scotchman occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in England die there, the moveables he carried with him ought to be held Scotch moveables, to be regulated by the law of Scotland: and the Engliſh judges, were they permitted to decide <hi>ſecundum bonum et aequum,</hi> without being fettered by their own municipal law, would certainly be of the ſame opinion. This article demands peculiar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: here is a ſituation of things not a little ſingular, a ſituation that obliges our judges to follow, not their own law, not the <hi>jus gentium,</hi> but the municipal law of another country.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, a purchaſe of Scotch moveables made by a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, doth not change the legal country of theſe moveables, if I
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0743600300:366"/>
may uſe the expreſſion. An aſſignment by the foreigner in the form of his own country, will not be a good title of property; nor will the foreign method of conveying effects from the dead to the living be held ſufficient. But the nomination of an executor by will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an univerſal title effectual <hi>jure gentium,</hi> ought to be ſuſtained every where. Yet letters of adminiſtration, from the prerogative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court of Canterbury for example, will not be ſuſtained here, even though granted to the next of kin; for the powers of that court are confined within its own territory, and therefore the next of kin muſt be confirmed here.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, as to moveables connected with an immoveable ſubject, ſuch as the furniture of a houſe, the goods in a ſhop, or the ſtocking of a farm; the country of the principal determines that of the acceſſory, without regard to the proprietor, of whatever country he be. The connection here between the moveables and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable ſubject, prevails over their connection with the proprietor: and accordingly where the principal ſubject is in Scotland, theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory moveables will, to all intents and purpoſes, be governed by the municipal law of Scotland. To illuſtrate this branch I put the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing caſe. A family has been long in poſſeſſion of two land-eſtates, one in England, one in Scotland, with two manſion-houſes complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed, which are inhabited by turns. The proprietor dies without children, leaving a brother, and children of a deceaſed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This makes it a queſtion of importance in the ſucceſſion to his moveables, whether the law of England or of Scotland be the rule. In England, there is a repreſentation in moveables as well as in land; and when a man dies, the children of a deceaſed brother or ſiſter take a ſhare of the moveables with the brothers and ſiſters alive: in Scotland, there is no repreſentation in moveables. Will this queſtion depend on the accident of the proprietor's dying in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or in Scotland? This will hardly be admitted; for the mind is averſe to make right depend on chance. And yet, abſtracting from this accident, there is no reaſon to prefer the law of either country before that of the other. The reſult then is, that the houſehold-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture in England, as Engliſh effects, muſt be diſtributed among the next of kin according to the Engliſh law; and that the Scotch law be the rule with reſpect to the houſehold-furniture in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, with reſpect to a proceſs as well as with reſpect to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal execution, no circumſtance is regarded but loco-poſition merely, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever occaſional or accidental. A judge has authority over every perſon and every legal ſubject within his territory; and to whatever country goods may belong, the proprietor or a creditor muſt claim them from
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0743600300:367"/>
the court to which they are ſubjected for the time. No other judge can give authority to apprehend the poſſeſſion, or to ſeize them by execution for payment of debt.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV. Foreign covenants and deeds reſpecting debts.</head>
                  <p>DEbts due by inhabitants in this country to foreigners, make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branch of the extraordinary juriſdiction of the court of ſeſſion concerning foreign matters. The form of conveying ſuch debts <hi>inter vivos,</hi> of tranſmitting them from the dead to the living, of attaching them by execution, &amp;c. have not hitherto been brought under general rules; and our judges are ever at a loſs by what law theſe particulars ought to be governed, whether by our law, by that of the country where the creditor reſides, or by the <hi>jus gentium.</hi> To get free of this doubt, authors and lawyers are ſtrongly diſpoſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilate debts to land, by beſtowing upon them a local ſituation. And yet this fiction, bold as it is, removes not the doubt; for ſtill the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion recurs, Where is the debt ſuppoſed to exiſt? whether in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of the creditor or in that of the debtor? Conſidering a debt as a <hi>ſubject</hi> belonging to the creditor, it ſeems the more natural fiction to place it with the creditor as in his poſſeſſion; and hence the maxim, <hi>Mobilia non habent ſequelam.</hi> Others are more diſpoſed to place it with the debtor; a thought ſuggeſted from conſidering, that the money muſt be demanded from the debtor, and that upon his failure the ſuit for payment muſt be in his <hi>forum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is unneceſſary to beſtow words upon proving, that a debt is not a <hi>corpus</hi> to be capable of loco-poſition, but purely a <hi>jus incorporale.</hi> Rejecting then fictions, which never tend to ſound knowledge, let us take things as they are, and endeavour to draw light from the nature of the ſubject. Here are two perſons connected, a debtor and a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, living in different countries, and ſubjected to different laws. In this caſe it muſt even at firſt ſight appear, that there can be no reaſon for holding by the one law in every particular, rejecting the other; for whether is it the law of the debtor or of the creditor that muſt be preferred? Deliberating upon this matter, it appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that as payment muſt be demanded in the <hi>forum</hi> of the debtor, the form of the action that is brought againſt him, the method of procedure, the execution that paſſes upon the decree, and what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is liable as heir in place of the debtor dying before payment,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0743600300:368"/>
muſt all be regulated by the law of the debtor's country. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, with reſpect to titles derived from the creditor, whether <hi>inter vivos</hi> or by ſucceſſion, theſe naturally are regulated by the law of the creditor's country. Thus, an aſſignment made by a creditor in Scotland, according to our form, of a debt due to him by a perſon in a foreign country, ought to be ſuſtained in that country as a good title for demanding payment: and a foreign aſſignment of a debt due here, regular according to the law of the country, ought to be ſuſtained by our judges. A foreign aſſignment cannot at any rate be ſubjected to the regulations of our act 1681, for preventing forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor to any other of our regulations; becauſe theſe regard no deeds but what are executed in Scotland. The ſame with reſpect to heirs and ſucceſſors. If a man make a ſettlement of his effects ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forms of his own country, that ſettlement ought to be ſuſtained every where. And if he die inteſtate, the heir that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſucceed him by the law of his own country, ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to his moveable effects where-ever ſituated, and to demand pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his debtors where-ever found: for when a man forbears to make a deed regulating his ſucceſſion, it is underſtood to be his will that the law of his own country take place; if he be ſatisfied with the heir whom the law calls to his ſucceſſion, he has no occaſion to make a ſettlement. Thus, in a competition between the brother and the nephew of Captain William Brown, who died, in Scotland his native country, inteſtate and without children, concerning move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able debts due to the Captain in Ireland, the brother was preferred as next in kin by the law of Scotland; though by the laws of England and Ireland, which admit the <hi>jus repraeſentationis</hi> in the ſucceſſion of moveables, a nephew and niece have the ſame right with a brother and ſiſter <note n="*" place="bottom">Nov. 28. 1744, Brown of Braid contra John Brown merchant in Edinburgh.</note>.</p>
                  <p>From what is ſaid it will appear, that, with reſpect to the matter in hand, debts differ widely from land and from moveables. It is in vain to claim the property of any ſubject, unleſs the title of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty be complete and ſtrictly formal. An equitable title in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one that is legal, can never found a real action: it cannot have a ſtronger effect than to found an action againſt the proprietor to grant a more formal right; or in his default, that the court ſhould grant it. But in the caſe of a debt, where the queſtion is not about property but about payment, an equitable title coincides in a good meaſure with a legal title. An aſſignment made by a foreign creditor
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0743600300:369"/>
according to the formalities of his country, will be ſuſtained here as a good title for demanding payment from the debtor: and it will be ſuſtained even though informal, provided it be good <hi>jure gentium;</hi> that is, provided it appear that the creditor really granted the aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such effect hath an equitable title; and a legal title can have no ſtronger effect.</p>
                  <p>It muſt however be admitted, that an equitable title hath not ſo complete an effect in a competition. Suppoſe an Engliſh creditor grants an aſſignment in the Engliſh form, of a debt due to him in Scotland: this aſſignment, though it transfer not the <hi>jus crediti</hi> to the aſſignee, is however an order upon the debtor to pay to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee. But ſuch aſſignment, even though the firſt in order of time, will not avail againſt a more formal aſſignment taken <hi>bona fide,</hi> and regularly intimated to the debtor. An equitable title may be good againſt the granter; but can never be ſuſtained in a competition with a legal title, where both parties are <hi>in pari caſu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With reſpect to debts due here to foreigners, it is a queſtion not leſs intricate than important, in what manner they are to be attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by execution, and from what court the execution muſt iſſue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the court to which the creditor is ſubjected or from that of the debtor. In England, debts, like other moveables, are attached by the legal execution of <hi>Fieri facies,</hi> ſimilar to our poinding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by that execution the <hi>jus crediti</hi> is transferred <hi>funditus</hi> from the original creditor to his creditor. At this rate it would ſeem, that a <hi>Fieri facies</hi> executed againſt the creditor in England, ſhould, like an intimated aſſignment, be effectual againſt the debtor here, ſo as to make execution in this country unneceſſary. This inference appears extremely plauſible, but we muſt inquire whether it be ſolidly founded. Judicial powers, which are ſtrictly territorial, reſemble not will nor conſent, which operate every where with equal authority. A volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conveyance by a proprietor, or by a creditor, is an univerſal title that ought to be made effectual by judges in every country: and could law compel any man to make a conveyance, ſuch conveyance would in juſtice be equivalent to a voluntary conveyance, to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual every where. But it is not in the power of law to force the will; and therefore a conveyance by legal execution cannot be held a conveyance from the debtor. In order to ſupply the want of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary conveyance, all that can be done is for the judge to be the diſponer; and that diſpoſition he can make where the ſubject to be convey'd is under his power and authority. In our poinding, for example, the property of the goods is transferred to the poinder, not
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0743600300:370"/>
by the will of the debtor, but by the will and authority of the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff within whoſe territory the effects lie: but the ſheriff cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge to the poinder the debtor's effects in any other territory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are not ſubjected to his juriſdiction. The matter is clear as to moveable goods, and the ſame rule muſt hold as to debts; for if the creditor cannot be compelled to make a conveyance, all that can be done by way of authority is, to award execution againſt his debtor for payment of the debt upon which the execution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. But this execution muſt be awarded by the judge within whoſe territory the debtor reſides; for no other judge hath authority over him. Thus it is evident, that an Engliſh <hi>Fieri facies</hi> is not a good title for demanding payment of a debt due in Scotland. And therefore, with reſpect to legal execution, it holds in general, that the judge of the territory within which the ſubjects are, or the debtor lives, muſt be applied to.</p>
                  <p>I conclude this ſection with applying to debts, what is obſerved with reſpect to moveables in the ſection immediately foregoing. The nomination of an executor in a teſtament, is an univerſal title which ought to be ſuſtained every where; and is always ſuſtained in the court of ſeſſion to oblige debtors in this country to make payment <note n="*" place="bottom">Durie, Feb. 16. 1627, Lawſon contra Kello.</note>. But an executor dative with letters of adminiſtration, hath not a title to ſue for payment <hi>extra territorium.</hi> And the ſame is the caſe of a guardian to a lunatic's eſtate named in England by the chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor: he has no title to ſue for payment of the lunatic's debts in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <note n="†" place="bottom">June 21. 1749, Moriſon, &amp;c. contra Earl of Sutherland.</note>.</p>

                  <p>UNder this head come properly foreign writs; becauſe no writ where there is wanting any ſolemnity of the law of Scotland, can be effectual here to any other purpoſe than as evidence merely. And as among civilized nations, the ſolemnities required to make a writ effectual, are ſuch as give ſufficient evidence of will; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed as a rule with us, That contracts, bonds, diſpoſitions, and other writs, executed according to the law of the place, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bative
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0743600300:371"/>
in this country. Thus, action is always ſuſtained upon a foreign bond having the formalities of the place where it was granted <note n="*" place="bottom">Haddington, Jan. 19. 1610, Fortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Shewan.</note>: and an extract of a bond from Bourdeaux ſubſcribed by the tabellion only, and bearing that the bond itſelf ſubſcribed by the granter was inſerted in his regiſter, was ſuſtained, being <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum conſuetudinem loci</hi>

Depoſitions of witneſſes taken abroad, upon a commiſſion from the court of ſeſſion, were ſuſtained here, though ſubſcribed by the commiſſioners and clerk only, not by the witneſſes, ſuch being the form in the country where the depoſitions were taken <note n="‡" place="bottom">Fountainhall, March 19. 1707, Cummin contra Kennedy.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The ſame rule obtains even though the foreign bond bear a clauſe for regiſtering in Scotland. This circumſtance ſhows indeed, that the creditor had it in view to make his claim effectual in Scotland; but it weakens not the evidence of the bond, which therefore will be a good inſtruction of the claim <note n="‖" place="bottom">Home, Feb. 14. 1721, Junquet la Pine contra Creditors of Lord Sempill.</note>.</p>
                  <p>By the law of England, payment of money may be proved by witneſſes; and therefore the ſame proof will be admitted here with reſpect to payment ſaid to be made in England. For our act of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt confining the evidence to writ <note n="**" place="bottom">Hiſtorical Law-tracts, tract 2.</note>, regards no payment but what is made in Scotland; and it would be unjuſt to deprive a man of that evidence which the law of his own country made him rely on.

This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me a wrong judgement. For, as obſerved above, the clauſe of regiſtration imported only, that the creditor had it in view to make his debt effectual in Scotland. It certainly did not bar the debtor from making payment in England; nor of proving that payment by witneſſes, had the ſuit been brought againſt him there: whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the ſame proof ought to be admitted when the ſuit is brought here.</p>

becauſe it is the oath, not of a party, but of a ſingle witneſs.

                  <head>SECT. VI. What effect is given to foreign ſtatutes and decrees.</head>
                  <p>THough a ſtatute, as obſerved above, hath no authority as ſuch <hi>extra territorium;</hi> it becomes however neceſſary, upon many occaſions, to lay weight upon foreign ſtatutes, in order to fulfil the rules of juſtice. Many examples occur of indirect effects given thus to foreign ſtatutes. One of theſe effects I ſhall mention at preſent for the ſake of illuſtration; reſerving others to be handled where particular ſtatutes are taken under conſideration. Obedience is due to the laws of our country, and to trangreſs any of them is a moral wrong <note n="†" place="bottom">See p. 179.</note>. This moral wrong ought to weigh with judges in every country; becauſe it is an act of injuſtice to ſupport any moral wrong, by making it the foundation either of an action or of an exception. I give for an example the ſtatute prohibiting any member of a court of law to buy land about which there is a proceſs depending <note n="‡" place="bottom">13. Edward I. cap. 49. Act 216. parl. 1594.</note>. Such a purchaſe being made notwithſtanding, the purchaſer follows the vender into a foreign country, in order to compel him by a proceſs to make the bargain effectual. A bargain unlawful where made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not lawful by change of place; and therefore the foreign judge ought not to ſupport ſuch unlawful bargain by ſuſtaining action upon it. Courts were inſtituted to repreſs, not to inforce wrong; and the judge who inforces any unlawful paction, becomes acceſſory to the wrong.</p>
                  <p>Several intricate queſtions ariſe from the different preſcriptions that are eſtabliſhed in different countries. In our deciſions upon that head, it is commonly the point diſputed, Whether a foreign pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0743600300:373"/>
or that of our own country ought to be the rule. This never ought to be a diſpute; for every caſe that comes under our own law, muſt be decided by that law, and not by the law of any other country. When the matter is accurately conſidered, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate will be found to turn upon a different point, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the caſe in queſtion come under our preſcription. This may often be a doubtful point; becauſe many caſes come under the words of a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, that are not comprehended under its ſpirit and intendment. Caſes of that nature belong to the juriſdiction of the ſeſſion, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered as a court of equity to mitigate the rigor of ſtatute-law, by denying force to the words when unwarily more extenſive than the will of the legiſlature <note n="*" place="bottom">See p. 188.</note>. What only belongs to the preſent ſubject, is the effect that ought to be given to foreign preſcriptions where our own are not applicable; and the ſubject thus circumſcribed will be found abundantly ſimple and plain. By the Engliſh act of limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note n="†" place="bottom">21. James I. cap. 16. § 3.</note>, <q rend="inline">"All actions of account and upon the caſe, all actions of debt grounded upon any lending or contract without ſpeciality, all actions of debt for arrearages of rent, &amp;c. ſhall be ſued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſix years after the cauſe of action."</q> The purpoſe of this ſtatute is to guard againſt a ſecond demand for payment of temporary debts, ſuch as generally are paid regularly: and to make that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe effectual, action is denied upon ſuch debts after ſix years. As ſtatutes have no coercive authority <hi>extra territorium,</hi> this ſtatute can have no effect with us other than to infer a preſumption of payment from the ſix years delay of bringing an action. And accordingly, when a proceſs is brought in Scotland for payment of an Engliſh debt after the Engliſh preſcription has taken place, it cannot be pleaded here that the action is cut off by the ſtatute of limitations: but it can be pleaded here, and will be ſuſtained, that the debt is preſumed to have been paid. Conſidering that the ſtatute can have no authority here, except to infer a preſumption of payment, it follows, that the plaintiff muſt be permitted to defeat the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by poſitive evidence, or to overbalance it by contrary preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to ſhow from the circumſtances of his caſe that payment cannot be preſumed. As to poſitive evidence, the purſuer has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the oath of the defendant; and an acknowledgement that the debt is ſtill exiſting defeats the preſumption of payment <note n="‡" place="bottom">February 9. 1738, Rutherford contra Sir James Campbell.</note>. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive payment may alſo be counterbalanced by contrary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0743600300:374"/>
A caſe of this nature is reported by Gilmour <note n="*" place="bottom">November 1664, Garden contra Ramſay.</note>, to the following purpoſe: <q rend="inline">"A bond preſcribed by the Engliſh law while the parties reſided there, was afterwards made the foundation of a proceſs in Scotland. The court refuſed to ſuſtain the Engliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, becauſe the bond was drawn in the Scotch form be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Scotchmen, and bore a clauſe of regiſtration for execution in Scotland."</q> The circumſtances of this caſe ſhow, that the creditor laid his account to receive payment in Scotland, or to raiſe his action there; and as a bond bearing a clauſe of regiſtration preſcribes not in Scotland till forty years elapſe, the court juſtly thought, that to preſerve the claim alive the creditor had no occaſion to guard againſt any preſcription but that of Scotland. Further, there are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances where the ſtatute of limitation cannot infer any preſumption of payment. What if the debtor within the ſix years did retire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſea? The forbearance in that caſe to bring an action againſt a man who cannot eaſily be reached, and whoſe reſidence perhaps is not known, cannot infer the ſlighteſt preſumption againſt the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The ſtatute however, which makes no exception, muſt in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have been obeyed, till the defect was ſupplied by another ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. But the court of ſeſſion is under no ſuch dilemma: a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of payment will not be ſuſtained when the circumſtances of the caſe admit not ſuch preſumption.</p>
                  <p>The foregoing defect of the ſtatute of limitations is ſupplied by the Engliſh ſtatute 4<hi>to Aunae, cap.</hi> 16. declaring, <q rend="inline">"That where the perſon againſt whom a claim lies is beyond ſeas, the ſtatute of limitation ſhall not run againſt the creditor."</q> This ſtatute is alſo defective, becauſe it includes not Scotland; for a preſumption of payment cannot juſtly be urged againſt an Engliſh creditor, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears to ſue while his debtor is out of England though not beyond ſea. Action however muſt be denied in England by force of the ſtatute, though the debtor has been all along in Scotland. But this is no rule to us: we are at liberty to judge of the weight of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption from circumſtances; and accordingly the court of ſeſſion ſuſtained action after the ſix years againſt a man who reſided moſt of the time in Scotland <note n="†" place="bottom">March 4. 1755, Truſtees for the creditors of Renton contra Baillie.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Though the act of limitations of James I. makes no proviſion for the caſe where the debtor happens to be in a different country, it is more circumſpect as to the creditor's reſidence. For in the 7th ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0743600300:375"/>
it is provided, <q rend="inline">"That the preſcription ſhall not run againſt the creditor while he is beyond ſeas:"</q> and juſtly, becauſe in that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation his delaying to bring an action infers not againſt him any preſumption of payment. The caſe is parallel where the creditor happens to reſide in Scotland, and therefore his reſidence there muſt alſo bar a preſumption of payment. Hence it appears that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, July 1717, Rae contra Wright, is erroneous: and indeed it is ſo in more reſpects than one. James Rae a Scotch pedlar having died in England, his brother Richard intermeddled with his effects there at ſhort hand without any warrant. Richard, during the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſix years, returned to Dumfries, and died there. After the ſix years were elapſed, a proceſs was brought againſt his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by William Rae, a third brother, to account to him for the half of the effects thus irregularly intermeddled with. The court ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the defence, That the action was cut off by the Engliſh ſtatute of limitations. This was unjuſt. While Richard remained in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the circumſtance that William, living in Scotland, forbore to raiſe a ſuit in England, afforded not the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion that he had received payment from Richard. And ſuppoſe he had lived in England, payment could not be preſumed againſt him, when his debtor left England before the lapſe of the ſix years.</p>
                  <p>By eſtabliſhed practice in England, action is not ſuſtained upon a double bond after twenty years. The intereſt at the rate of <hi>5 per cent.</hi> equals the principal in twenty years, which therefore exhauſts the whole penal part of the bond, and makes the double ſum due in equity as well as at common law. After this period, the ſum muſt remain barren, becauſe intereſt is not ſtipulated in the bond: and in that view, it is juſtly inferred from the delay of demanding pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the twenty years, that payment muſt already have been made. This in effect is an Engliſh preſcription, inferring from long delay a preſumption of payment. It follows therefore, if the debtor have lived all along in England, and the creditor have ſuffered the preſcription to run againſt him, that the preſumptive payment ought to be ſuſtained here as in England.</p>
                  <p>In the Engliſh bankrupt ſtatute, 13th Eliſabeth, cap. 7. § 2. it is enacted, <q rend="inline">"That the commiſſioners ſhall have power to ſell all the goods of the bankrupt, real and perſonal, which he had before his bankruptcy, and to divide the produce among the creditors in proportion to the extent of their debts;"</q> and § 12. it is declared, <q rend="inline">"That this act ſhall not extend to land aliened <hi>bona fide</hi> before the bankruptcy."</q> Hence it appears to be the intention and effect of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0743600300:376"/>
the ſtatute, to bar all deeds by the bankrupt, and all execution by the creditors, after the firſt act of bankruptcy. And the Engliſh wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters accordingly invent a cauſe ſufficient to ſupport theſe ſtatutory ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. They hold, that the effects are veſted in the commiſſioners <hi>retro</hi> from the firſt act of bankruptcy: <q rend="inline">"Creditors upon whatſoever ſecurity they be, come in all equal, unleſs ſuch as have obtained actual execution before the bankruptcy, or had taken pledges for their juſt debts; and the reaſon is, becauſe, from the act of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy, all the bankrupt's eſtate is veſted in the commiſſioners <note n="*" place="bottom">New abridgement of the law, vol. 1. p. 258.</note>:"</q> A ſtrange fiction, to ſuppoſe the bankrupt's eſtate veſted in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, before theſe commiſſioners be named or have a being! The ſtatute has a better foundation than a fiction: it is founded on juſt principles of equity, as is demonſtrated above <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. 5. of this book.</note>. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our obſervations upon the ſtatute to what more peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns this country, I muſt obſerve, that the great circulation of trade through the two kingdoms ſince the union, makes it frequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the court of ſeſſion to take the Engliſh bankrupt ſtatutes under conſideration; and it has puzzled the court mightily, what effect ſhould be given to them here. That a foreign ſtatute cannot have any coercive authority <hi>extra territorium,</hi> is clear: but at firſt view it is not ſo clear, that the ſtatutory transference of property a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, from the bankrupt to the commiſſioners, may not comprehend effects real or perſonal in Scotland, or in any other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign country; for why may not a legal conveyance be equivalent to a voluntary conveyance by the proprietor himſelf? I have had occaſion to obſerve above <note n="‡" place="bottom">Sect. 4. of the preſent chapter.</note>, that law cannot force the will, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel any man to make a conveyance: in place of a voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, when juſtice requires it to be granted, all that a court can do, or the legiſlature can do, is to be themſelves the diſponers; and it is evident that their deed of conveyance cannot reach any ſubject real or perſonal but what is within their territory. This makes a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid difference between a voluntary and a legal conveyance. The former has no relation to place: a deed of alienation, whether of land or of moveables, is good where-ever granted: an Engliſhman, for example, has in China the ſame power to alien his land in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that he had before he left his native country; and the power he has to diſpoſe of his moveables will reach them in the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant corner of the earth. The latter, on the contrary, has the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0743600300:377"/>
relation to place: the power of a court, and even of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being merely territorial, reacheth not lands nor moveables <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra territorium.</hi> We may then ſafely conclude, that the ſtatutory transference of property from the bankrupt to the commiſſioners, cannot carry any effects in Scotland: theſe are ſubjected to our own laws, and our own judges, and cannot be convey'd from one perſon to another by the authority of any foreign court, or of any foreign ſtatute. The Engliſh bankrupt ſtatutes however muſt not be totally diſregarded by us. One effect may and ought to be given them according to the rules of juſtice and equity: it is the duty of the debtor to ſell his effects for ſatisfying his creditors if he cannot otherwiſe procure money; and it is in particular the duty of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh bankrupt, to convey all his effects to the commiſſioners named by the chancellor, or to the aſſignees named by the creditors, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſold for payment of his debts: the Engliſh ſtatute, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying to the commiſſioners all the Engliſh funds, ſupplies the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of the bankrupt, and does for him what he himſelf ought to do: but as the Engliſh ſtatute has no authority over funds belonging to the bankrupt in Scotland, it becomes neceſſary for the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners or aſſignees to apply to the court of ſeſſion, <q rend="inline">"ſpecifying the debtor's bankruptcy, and his failure to make a conveyance; and therefore praying that the court will adjudge to the plaintiffs the debtor's effects in Scotland; or rather that they will order the ſame to be ſold, and the price to be paid to the plaintiffs."</q> And to that purpoſe, the proper action, in my apprehenſion, is a proceſs of ſale of the debtor's moveables as well as of his land. Debts due here to the bankrupt may alſo be ſold; but as againſt ſolvent debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors a proceſs for payment is better management, it appears that, in in the caſe of bankruptcy, this proceſs is competent to the aſſignees without neceſſity of an arreſtment <note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. 4. of this book.</note>. The aſſignees being truſtees for behoof of the whole creditors, have a claim in equity to the bankrupt's whole effects, to be converted into money for payment of the creditors; and in the forms of the law of Scotland there appears nothing to bar the aſſignees from bringing a direct action for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the bankrupt's debtors here, as he himſelf could have done before his bankruptcy. In thus appointing the bankrupt's debtors to make payment to the aſſignees, the court of ſeſſion goes no farther than to ſuſtain the ſaid equitable claim, and exerts no power but what is the foundation of all legal execution, <hi>viz.</hi> making that conveyance for the bankrupt which he himſelf ought to have
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0743600300:378"/>
made. By this expeditious method, juſtice is ſatisfied, and no perſon is hurt.</p>
                  <p>Whether the price of the bankrupt's moveable funds, and the ſum ariſing from the debts due to him, ought to be diſtributed here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his creditors, or be remitted to England for that purpoſe, is a matter purely of expediency. The rule of diſtribution ſeems to be the ſame in both countries; and the creditors therefore have no intereſt in the queſtion, except what may ariſe from the convenience of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving payment in one place rather than in another. But if the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt's land in Scotland have been attached by execution, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always the caſe, the price of it upon a ſale muſt be diſtributed here; for the purchaſer is not bound to pay the price till the real debts be convey'd to him, and the real creditors are not bound to convey till they get payment.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place come foreign decrees: which are of two kinds; one ſuſtaining the claim, and one diſmiſſing it. A foreign decree ſuſtaining the claim, is not one of thoſe univerſal titles which ought to be made effectual every where. It is a title that depends on the authority of the court whence it iſſued, and therefore has no coercive authority <hi>extra territorium.</hi> And yet as it would be hard to oblige the perſon who claims on a decree, to bring a new action againſt his party in every country to which he may retire; therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon utility, as well as regard to a ſiſter court, have eſtabliſhed a rule among all civilized nations, That a foreign decree ſhall be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, unleſs ſome good exception be oppoſed to it in law or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This, in effect, is making no wider ſtep in favour of the decree, than to preſume it juſt till the contrary be proved. But this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not a decree decerning for a penalty; becauſe no court rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons itſelf bound to puniſh, or to concur in puniſhing, any delict committed <hi>extra territorium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A foreign decree which, by diſmiſſing the claim, aſſords an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio rei judicatae</hi> againſt it, enjoys a more extenſive privilege. We not only preſume it to be juſt, but will not admit any evidence of its being unjuſt. The reaſon follows. Public utility, regarding the ſafety and quiet of individuals, requires that there be ſome means for putting a final iſſue to every controverſy that can be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a court; for otherwiſe law-ſuits would be perpetual. A decree diſmiſſing a claim, is in its nature ultimate; and ſuch decree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt put an end to the controverſy, if ever it be to have an end. The effect then given to an <hi>exceptio rei judicatae,</hi> is derived from the common intereſt of mankind. A decree diſmiſſing a claim, may, it
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0743600300:379"/>
is true, be unjuſt, as well as a decree ſuſtaining it. But they differ widely in one capital point: in declining to give redreſs againſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree diſmiſſing a claim, the court is not guilty of authoriſing inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, even ſuppoſing the decree to be unjuſt: the utmoſt that can be ſaid is, that the court forbears to interpoſe in behalf of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but ſuch forbearance, inſtead of being faulty, is highly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious in every caſe where private juſtice claſhes with public utility <note n="*" place="bottom">See Concluſion of book 2.</note>. The caſe is very different with reſpect to a decree of the other kind; for to award execution upon a foreign decree without admitting any objection againſt it, would be, for ought the court can know, to ſupport and promote injuſtice. A court, as well as an individual, may in certain circumſtances have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to forbear acting, or executing their office: but the doing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, or the ſupporting it, cannot be juſtified in any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>To illuſtrate the practice of Scotland with reſpect to a foreign de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſuſtaining a claim, I ſubjoin a remarkable caſe. By ſtatute 12<hi>mo Annae, cap.</hi> 18. made perpetual 4<hi>to Geo.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. it is enacted, <q rend="inline">"That the collector of the cuſtoms, or any other perſon who ſhall be employed in preſerving any veſſel in diſtreſs, ſhall, within thirty days after the ſervice performed, be paid a reaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the ſame; and in default thereof, that the ſhip or goods ſo ſaved ſhall remain in the cuſtody of the collector till ſuch time as he and thoſe employ'd by him ſhall be reaſonably gratified for their aſſiſtance and trouble, or good ſecurity given for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe."</q> This is where the merchant claims his ſhip or cargo. But in caſe no perſon appear to claim, there is the following proviſo: <q rend="inline">"That goods which are in their nature periſhable, ſhall be forthwith ſold by the collector; and that, after deducting all charges, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the price, with a fair and juſt account of the whole, ſhall be tranſmitted to the exchequer, there to remain for the benefit of the rightful owner; and that the ſame ſhall be delivered to him ſo ſoon as he appears, and makes a claim."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brunton and Chalmers, owners of a veſſel called <hi>The Serpent's prize,</hi> loaded the ſame with 100 quarters of wheat for Zealand. In her voyage ſhe was ſtranded at a place called <hi>Redſcar,</hi> near the town of Stocktown. Chalmers having got notice of the accident, repaired immediately to Redſcar; and found his wheat in the hands of John Wilſon collector of the cuſtoms at Stocktown; part of it laid up in
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0743600300:380"/>
lofts, and part in the open field; the whole greatly damaged by ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water. Finding it neceſſary to diſpoſe of the wheat inſtantly, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the collector for liberty to ſell; offering to put the price in his hand as ſecurity for the ſalvage. This being obſtinately refuſed, he took a proteſt againſt the collector, and brought againſt him an action of treſpaſs upon the caſe before the King's bench. And the defendant having put himſelf upon his country, the cauſe came to a trial at Newcaſtle; where a ſpecial verdict was returned, in ſubſtance finding, <q rend="inline">"That all reaſonable care was taken of the wheat by the collector, and others by his order: That on the 3d of October then next following, James Chalmers applied to the collector, deſiring that the wheat, being much damaged, might be forthwith ſold; and that the money produced by ſuch ſale might be left in the hand of the collector to anſwer all charges; but did not then offer to pay to the collector any money for ſalvage: neither did the collector then make any demand on that account, he not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time what the ſalvage amounted to; but then refuſed to deliver the ſaid wheat, or permit the ſame to be ſold, he having an order from the commiſſioners of his Majeſty's cuſtoms for that purpoſe."</q> And the verdict concludes thus: <q rend="inline">"But whether, upon the whole matter aforeſaid by the ſaid jurors in form afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid found, the within-named John Wilſon be guilty of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes within written or not, the ſaid jurors are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and pray advice from the court thereupon."</q> The judge at that circuit having referred the cauſe to the court of King's bench at Weſtminſter, judgement was at laſt there given on the 18th July 1751, after ſeveral continuations, <q rend="inline">"Finding, That the ſaid John Wilſon is not guilty of the premiſſes; that the ſaid Brunton and Chalmers ſhall take nothing by their ſaid bill; but that they be in mercy, &amp;c. for their falſe claim; and that the ſaid John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon go thereof without day, &amp;c. And it is further conſidered, That the ſaid John recover againſt the ſaid Brunton and Chalmers ſixty pounds, for his coſts and charges laid out by him about his defence on this behalf; and that the ſaid John have execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,"</q> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For this ſum of L. 60 awarded to the collector for coſts, he brought an action againſt Brunton and Chalmers, before the court of ſeſſion; and in ſupport of his claim ſet forth, That it is founded on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, <hi>Quod res judicata pro veritate habetur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The defendants inſiſted, That this preſumption muſt yield to direct evidence of injuſtice, which would clearly appear upon comparing
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0743600300:381"/>
the decree with the ſtatute. And the following circumſtances were urged: Firſt, That though the wheat was in a periſhing condition, the collector refuſed to permit the ſame to be ſold, even contrary to his own intereſt, as the price to him was a better ſecurity for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage than the damaged wheat. Secondly, When the application for ſale was made, the collector was not ready to make his claim for ſalvage, not knowing at that time the amount thereof; and in theſe circumſtances to forbid the ſale, was not only rigorous, but a poſitive act of injuſtice: it was, to abandon the wheat to deſtruction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out permitting the defendants to interpoſe. Even ready money to pay the ſalvage would not have availed them, ſeeing the collector was not in a condition to make any demand.</p>
                  <p>This caſe being reported by the Lord Ordinary, it occurred at adviſing, that the ſtatute provides nothing about ſelling periſhable goods, except in the caſe that the merchant does not appear to claim the wrecked goods. Therefore the preſent caſe is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the ſtatute. It is a <hi>caſus omiſſus,</hi> which in equity muſt be ſupplied agreeably to the intendment and purpoſe of the ſtatute.</p>
                  <p>Viewing the matter in this light, it appeared, in the firſt place, that the defendants, being proprietors of the wheat, were intitled to diſpoſe of it, provided the collector ſuffered no prejudice as to his claim of ſalvage, which he certainly did not if the price were put in his hand. Nay his ſecurity would be improved by the ſale, which would afford him current coin inſtead of periſhing wheat. It was conſidered, in the ſecond place, that this is agreeable to the intendment of the ſtatute; for if the cuſtomhouſe-officer muſt diſpoſe of periſhable goods when there is none to claim, much more where the owner appears, and inſiſts for a ſale. <hi>3tio,</hi> The ſtatute, when it intitles the cuſtomhouſe-officers to retain the goods for ſecurity of the ſalvage, undoubtedly ſuppoſes that the officer can inſtruct his claim, in order that the merchant may have inſtant poſſeſſion of the goods, upon paying the ſalvage. In this view the conduct of the collector was altogether unjuſtifiable. The ſtatute gives no authority for retaining the goods as a ſecurity for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, unleſs as a <hi>ſuccedaneum</hi> when ſatisfaction is not offered in money; and as the collector here was not ready to receive ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was a treſpaſs to retain the goods in a periſhing condition, becauſe the ſtatute gave him no authority to act in ſo oppreſſive a manner.</p>
                  <p>With regard to this matter in general, one obſervation had great
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0743600300:382"/>
weight, That it never could be the intention of the legiſlature, to force merchants firſt to pay ſalvage, and thereafter to undergo the riſk of periſhable and damnified goods, the price of which poſſibly might not amount to the ſalvage. If the goods be abandoned to thoſe who ſave them, there can be no claim for ſalvage; for ſalvage can never exceed the benefit procured by it. Upon this footing the collector could not in common juſtice demand more than the value of the goods for his ſalvage; and <hi>a fortiori</hi> could not demand any ſecurity beyond that value. The court accordingly unanimouſly refuſed to interpoſe their authority for execution upon this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="*" place="bottom">January 6. 1756<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> John Wilſon collector of the cuſtoms at Stocktown contra Robert Brunton and James Chalmers merchants in Edinburgh.</note>.</p>
                  <p>This judgement of the King's bench may poſſibly be juſtified as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by a court of common law, which, in interpreting ſtatutes, muſt adhere to the letter, without regarding the intention of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If ſo, the proprietors of the wheat ought to have applied to the chancery, or have removed their cauſe there by a <hi>Certiorari.</hi> If courts of common law in England be ſo confined, their conſtitution is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely imperfect. But ſuppoſing the court of King's bench to have acted properly according to its conſtitution, it was notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right in the court of ſeſſion, to refuſe execution upon a foreign decree that is materially unjuſt, or contrary to equity.</p>
                  <p>An appeal entered by Collector Wilſon was heard <hi>ex parte,</hi> and the decree of the court of ſeſſion reverſed; by which the L. 60 of coſts decerned in the court of King's bench was made effectual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chalmers and Brunton.</p>
                  <p>The decree, if I have been rightly informed, was reverſed for the following reaſon; that in England the decree of a foreign ſupreme court has ſuch credence, that judgement is immediately given, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entering into the merits, provided the matter have been litiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that in all countries the decrees of the court of admiralty are, for the ſake of commerce, intitled to immediate execution; and that the ſame credence ought to have been given by the court of ſeſſion to the judgement of the King's bench.</p>
                  <p>Hence it would appear, that in England greater authority is given to foreign decrees than in any other civilized country; and indeed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than can be juſtified from the nature and conſtitution of any court. A foreign decree has no legal authority in England; and for the courts of Weſtminſter blindly to authoriſe execution upon a foreign decree, without admitting any objection againſt it, is a practice that
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0743600300:383"/>
cannot be approved, becauſe it muſt frequently lead them to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>But admitting the practice of England, it ought to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the practice of England is no authority in Scotland. In reviewing the decrees of the court of ſeſſion, the law of Scotland is the rule. And if the decree in queſtion was agreeable to the law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it ought to have been affirmed; eſpecially as the law of Scotland with reſpect to foreign decrees is not only in itſelf rational, but agreeable to the laws of all other civilized nations, England ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The houſe of Lords, we may reſt aſſured, could not intend to try the merits of a Scotch decree by the law or practice of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But as the appeal was heard <hi>ex parte,</hi> the reverſal has certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been founded upon the erroneous ſuppoſition, That, with reſpect to foreign decrees, the practice of Scotland is the ſame with that of England.</p>

            <head>NOTANDUM BENE.</head>
            <p>AMONG the many diviſions of human actions in the prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcourſe, there is one all along ſuppoſed, but not brought out into a clear light. It is what follows: 1. Actions that we are bound to perform. 2. Actions that we perform in proſecution of our rights or privileges. 3. Actions that are entirely voluntary or arbitrary; ſuch as are done for amuſement, or from an impulſe to act without having any end in view. Thus one leaps, runs, throws ſtones, merely to exert ſtrength or activity; which therefore are in the ſtricteſt ſenſe voluntary.</p>
            <p>In the preliminary diſcourſe, p. 26. we have the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, That the moral ſenſe prohibits every action that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably do miſchief; and therefore, that if the probability of miſchief be foreſeen, or may be foreſeen, the action is culpable or faulty. In ſtating this propoſition no actions were in view but the laſt in the foregoing diviſion; and it was an omiſſion not to confine the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to theſe; for it holds not with reſpect to actions done in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of our rights or privileges. Such actions are governed by a different principle, mentioned p. 58, That the probability of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, even foreſeen, prohibits me not from following out my rights or privileges. And it is happily ſo ordered by nature. When we act merely for amuſement, it is a ſalutary and juſt regulation, that we ſhould be anſwerable for what harm we do that either is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen or may be foreſeen. But our rights and privileges would be very little beneficial to us, were we put under the ſame reſtraint in making theſe effectual. What actions may be lawfully done in proſecuting our rights and privileges, are handled book 1. part 1. chap. 1. ſect. 1. What actions may be lawfully done without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in view to proſecute any right or privilege, are handled in the ſection immediately ſubſequent.</p>

            <head>PRINCIPLES founded on in this work.</head>
            <p>We muſt not do evil even to bring about good. 19.</p>
            <p>A man who is innocent is not liable to repair any hurt done by him. 28. 273.</p>
            <p>Where there is a right, ſome court muſt be impowered to make it effectual. 55. 132. 157. 215. 219. 237.</p>
            <p>For every wrong there ought to be a remedy. 55. 237.</p>
            <p>No intereſt of mine, not even the preſervation of life itſelf, authoriſes me to do any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to an innocent perſon. 58.</p>
            <p>Every man may proſecute his own right, without regarding any indirect or conſequential damage that another may ſuffer. 58.</p>
            <p>Juſtice will not permit a man to exerciſe his right where his intention is ſolely to hurt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 60.</p>
            <p>An action at law will not be ſuſtained if the plaintiff cannot ſhow that it will benefit him. 60.</p>
            <p>It is an immoral act, to ſtrip people of their property by throwing a ſtrong temptation in their way. 65.</p>
            <p>He that demands equity muſt give equity. 67. 279. 283.</p>
            <p>Equity holds a deed to be granted where it ought to be granted. 87.</p>
            <p>One is permitted to take advantage of another's error <hi>in damno evitando,</hi> not <hi>in lucro ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptando.</hi> 98. 101.</p>
            <p>No man is intitled to the aid of a court of equity when that aid becomes neceſſary by his own fault. 104.</p>
            <p>No perſon, however innocent, ought to take advantage of a tortious act by which another is hurt. 107. 108.</p>
            <p>A man ought not to take advantage of an improvement or reparation made upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubject, without refunding part of the expence, in proportion to the benefit he has received. 109.</p>
            <p>A thought retained within the mind cannot have the effect to qualify an obligation more than to create it. 120. 121.</p>
            <p>To bind a man by words beyond conſent, is repugnant to juſtice. 125.</p>
            <p>He who wills the end is underſtood to will the means proper for accompliſhing the end. 130.</p>
            <p>A perſon honoured in a deed can take no benefit by it if he counteract the declared will of the granter. 138.</p>
            <p>A man who has committed no fault cannot be deprived of his property. 143. 225. 232. 233. 302. 310. 312.</p>
            <p>No perſon is bound to fulfil an obligation that anſwers not the end purpoſed by it. 148.</p>
            <p>Cujus commodum ejus debet eſſe incommodum. <hi>158. 172. 280.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every crime againſt the law of nature may be puniſhed at the diſcretion of the judge, where the legiſlature has not appointed a particular puniſhment. 180.</p>
            <p>A caſe out of the miſchief is out of the meaning of the law, though it be within the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 199.</p>
            <p>No man is permitted to take advantage of a defect in evidence when that defect is occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſraud. 200.</p>
            <p>It is unjuſt to demand from the debtor privately, or even by legal execution, any ſubject that he is bound to convey to another. 221. 292.</p>
            <p>No man is ſuffered to take beneſit by his own fraud or wrong. 229.</p>
            <p>No perſon is ſuffered to make a defence contrary to conſcience, more than to make a claim. 234.</p>
