            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
ON THE
Late alarming BANKRUPTCIES in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WAR, famine, and peſtilence, uſed
formerly to fill up the number of
the general calamities of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
but, in the preſent age,
one has been added, <hi>viz.</hi> Bankruptcy. The
year 1772 will ever be remembered as a
year of confuſion, diſmay, and diſtreſs. All
<hi>Scotland</hi> has been ſhaken by a kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial
earthquake, while, like a company
connected by an electrical wire, the people
in every corner of the country have almoſt
inſtantaneouſly received the ſame ſhock.</p>
            <p>But it is to be feared that the evil has as
yet had very little effect, in compariſon of
what it will have. The term of <hi>Martinmas</hi>
is juſt at hand, and that of <hi>Candlemas</hi> is not
far off: at theſe terms payments muſt and
will be demanded; and there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to apprehend, that very miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
will enſue.</p>
            <p>There cannot therefore be a fitter ſubject
than that which I have choſen, for a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1214100600:5"/>
of ſuch a ſize as to be eaſily purchaſed
and generally read. In times of national
diſtreſs, there have been very uſeful hints
ſuggeſted by individuals: It is related, that
during the famous ſiege of <hi>Leyden,</hi> when the
inhabitants, who then defended themſelves
with a moſt determined bravery, were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
a ſurrender, becauſe they were in
abſolute want of proviſion, an aged citizen
of no conſiderable note ſtept forth, and told
them, that while there remained an old ſhoe
within the walls they ſhould not give up,
for that he had for ſeveral days ſupported
himſelf by leather, boiled long enough
to become tender, which though not a very
palatable diſh, afforded ſufficient nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prevent him from ſtarving: The
experiment was made, and found to ſucceed,
and thus the city was enabled to hold out;
till relieved by the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At ſuch times too the minds of men are
more than uſually diſpoſed to liſten to ſober
advice, and profit by friendly inſtruction;
and therefore it may be hoped that theſe
few pages will meet with an agreeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>The public odium is at preſent directed
againſt that claſs of men called <hi>bankers</hi>; but
it were to be wiſhed that a proper diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were made between true and falſe, or
real and fictitious bankers. Thoſe of the
former kind are deſcribed in ſo juſt and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1214100600:6"/>
lively a manner by a writer in England,
that his words ſhall be tranſcribed.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <p>Bankers are an honourable and an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſet of men in civil ſociety, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary in ſuch a trading nation
as ours: they in turn truſt the Lord, the
merchant, and the mechanic, with ſums
that give life, vigour, and diſpatch to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Banking is a moſt laudable, uſeful, and
advantageous refinement on buſineſs. It
collects together ſums of uſeleſs caſh, and
brings a large fund into circulation, which
otherwiſe muſt lie unemployed for the
time each man may not want it; or, in
other words, the Iodgments at a banker's
ſhop are made up of ſuch ſums as each of
his cuſtomers may not want for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
hour. The general fund aids every
man in turn, in proportion to his credit,
and interchangeably ſerves each his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
as their various occaſions may at
different periods require: like a large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervoir
made up from ſmall ſhallow and
uſeleſs rivulets, it ſupplies all its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in plentiful draughts, ſatisfies their
common and extraordinary wants at each
man's requiſition, and then turns that
which was before beneficial to no one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a wonderful and extenſive advantage.</p>
                  <p>Bankers are generally entitled to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
by fair character, a cloſe attention
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1214100600:7"/>
to buſineſs, and by fortunes of their own;
which not only give ſecurity, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
and blended with the credit and
various purpoſes of their cuſtomers and
friends.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Such are real bankers; and although we
have none exactly ſuch in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet we
have among us ſeveral merchants who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the ſame purpoſes, in ſomewhat a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
form, and I ſhall hold <hi>them</hi> as real
bankers on whom we can depend. Let us
comfort ourſelves that we have a few ſuch
among us. The late convulſions of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial
world have winnowed our traders,
and ſeparated the wheat from the chaff: we
now know the men of ſubſtance—of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in buſineſs—of prudence, to confine
their views within moderate bounds—and,
let me add, of honeſty. A few ſuch men
we have, and let us eſteem them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, what ſhall be ſaid of
thoſe who have held themſelves forth to the
world as poſſeſſed of good ſtocks, while, at
the ſame time, they were conſcious that
they were worſe than nothing? who, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to carry on the cheat, and at the ſame
time gratify the wretched vanity of figuring
for a while in borrowed feathers, have lived
with a degree of elegance, becoming in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the firſt rank, but ridiculous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
in men of low extraction: Such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1214100600:8"/>
men having been entruſted with
the money of numbers, and with the <hi>all</hi> of
ſome, have villanouſly conſumed it, and
involved their creditors in the ſame ruin,
though not in the ſame guilt, with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
On ſuch men let the conſequences
of their diſhoneſty fall heavy, for me. How
inconſiſtent is it, that in a country where
we hang a man who ſteals or robs to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of a trifle, we ſhould be ſo tender to
<hi>fraudulent bankrupts,</hi> though they have actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deprived their neighbours of ſums enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and occaſioned univerſal and deep
diſtreſs. I will, however, do what is in my
power to ſhow that I can diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
good and evil: I am not to be ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the whining of their artful emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to accept of a paultry compoſition,
and ſuffer <hi>them</hi> to live at large; nay, better
than I can afford to do: No;—for the ſake
of juſtice, for the ſake of deterring them,
and ſuch corrupt, hard-hearted impoſtors
from again making a prey of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
my voice is, <hi>Spare not:</hi> If they will
ſtrut, let it be in priſon; if they will be
merry, let it be within thoſe walls where
culprits dwell, as well-born, as remorſeleſs,
and as jovial as they.</p>
            <p>Yet let us not forget that there are a few
unfortunate; a few whoſe ruin has been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
through their connections with the
unworthy. For theſe I can make all the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1214100600:9"/>
allowance that the tendereſt humanity would
wiſh: But let us be ſure that the excuſe is
true, before we diſpenſe with the puniſhment.
The compaſſionate remedy of a <hi>Ceſſio-bonorum</hi>
is not granted but to ſuch debtors as have
<hi>proved that their failure has been occaſioned through
misfortune.</hi> We muſt have ſome evidence in
favour of all our bankrupts or inſolvent
debtors, or by whatever other name they
chuſe to paſs, before they have our indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
What that evidence ſhould be I do
not pretend to define, I leave it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of every enquirer; I myſelf am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably
ſatisfied with the innocence of ſome:
Woe be to thoſe villains who have thrown a
cloud of ſuſpicion over all, and made it ſo
hard for the truly honeſt to get themſelves
diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>Although men in trade have been the
prominent and firſt-diſcovered victims in the
late broad and ſudden cruſh; we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſeen ſeveral men of other profeſſions,
and ſome too of the loweſt, throwing their
ſhattered perſonal eſtates into the Court of
Seſſion, which by the new bankrupt-act
is become the perpetual light-houſe for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
fortunes, and univerſal guardian
of ſhip-wrecked goods. Were none but
traders ſwallowed up in this gulf of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy,
leſs would be my regret; but it is
a melancholy truth, that almoſt all will be
ſufferers in a greater or leſſer degrace; for, I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1214100600:10"/>
am ſorry to ſay it, that almoſt all are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
in the article of money and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
owing either to extravagance, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
or the deſire of being precipitantly
rich.</p>
            <p>Of the extravagance of certain men I have
already ſpoken with a due ſeverity; but I
am coming round, and ſhall have a word
with moſt of my neighbours. The miſchief
is, that for ſome years paſt there has been
in Scotland an abominable ſpirit of levelling
all thoſe diſtinctions which ages of civilized
ſociety have, through all the gradations of
politeneſs introduced amongſt mankind.
<q>
                  <l>Ill fares the land, to haſt'ning ills a prey,</l>
                  <l>Where wealth accumulates and men decay;</l>
               </q>
ſays Dr. <hi>Goldſmith:</hi> and I apply his elegant
lines to the decay of gentlemen. Ever ſince
the ſeat of government has been removed
from among us, we have been encreaſing
in riches and barbarity, as a body in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as it grows fat becomes coarſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
or amuſement draw the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our people of faſhion up to London;
and thoſe who remain are hardly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as moſt of them ſuffer themſelves
to mingle undiſtinguiſhed with the general
maſs. Upſtarts, who have picked up for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
abroad they beſt know how, and pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
at home, who have obtained poſſeſſion
of wealth by various means, have flaſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1214100600:11"/>
us with all the ſplendor of prodigality,
laviſhing away perhaps in one week as much
as ſupported their father's family, and might
ſtill ſupport a family of their neareſt relations
for a whole year. Our real gentry, who
have had every mechanical buſineſs, nay, in
ſome inſtances, every ſervile office, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them by the fathers of theſe men, have
been mean enough to aſſociate with them as
equals, and fooliſh enough to vie with them
in expence, till drowned in debt, their lands
have fallen to the lot of theſe very people.
And hence it has happened that there is no
diſtinction of tables, as there is no diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ranks; all muſt have an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of diſhes, all muſt have wines equally
coſtly, as all think themſelves equally <hi>gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
as the word is now uſed; ſo that it may
be juſtly ſaid, Our feaſts are noble, and our
manners plebeian. This, though an iron
age with a vengeance, in the true ſenſe of
the expreſſion, is, in one reſpect, a golden
age; for gold is the object on which all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
are fixed, and which procures all
thoſe advantages, which, in times of higher
ſpirit and nobler ſentiments, no riches could
obtain: I have ſaid that gold procures ſuch
advantages—I would alter the phraſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
for, from the very nature of things, the
genuine diſtinction which good birth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
cannot be the ſubject of commerce;
therefore the low-born enjoy it not, as it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1214100600:12"/>
can never be acquired; but, like the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant
drunken companion, who ſaid to his
friend who had fallen upon the ground,
'I cannot help you up, but I'll lie down
beſide you,' our people of birth bring
themſelves to a level with the mean; ſo that
when the genuine honours due to birth are
deſtroyed, gold may then purchaſe every
thing that remains.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> there is a court; in <hi>Ireland</hi> the
repreſentation of a court, which nearly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
the ſame purpoſe, and in both theſe
countries a diſtinction of ranks is preſerved;
whereas in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> except at a dancing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter's
ball, the weekly aſſembly for dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
or the annual levee of his Majeſty's
commiſſioner to the general aſſembly of the
kirk, and ſometimes a funeral, there is not
the leaſt room for precedency. I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to have a lord-lieutenant; but I could
wiſh that we had ſome deputy at the palace
of Holyrood-houſe, to keep us a little in mind
of the diſtinction of ranks. However ſome
factious ſpirits may attempt to deſtroy it, our
government, limited as it is, is certainly a
monarchical government, and, until it is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
changed to another, we ought to keep
alive the true ſpirit of it, which cannot be
done without obſerving the diſtinction of
ranks. "In a monarchical ſtate, (ſays an
ingenious French writer,) are two orders,
eſſentially ſeparate and diſtinct, the nobles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1214100600:13"/>
and the plebeians: the functions of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
are to defend it; thoſe of the latter to
feed and to enrich it, without ever aſpiring
to uſeleſs honours, which are not made for
them"</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould thoſe of the inferior ranks of
life think themſelves diſparaged, or treated
with tyrannical contempt, when they are
kept apart from thoſe whom they ought ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually
to reverence: They may be eſteemed
as reputable men in their ſtation, while they
remain in their own places with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and quietneſs, and do not fret their
minds by a vain and reſtleſs contention for
equality. They may lead perhaps as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
lives as thoſe above them, and if
ambition ſtirs within them, they may feed
it with ſome probability, while they pleaſe
themſelves with the idea, that the wealth
acquired by their induſtry may lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a family, which, in a long courſe
of time, may be as reſpectable and noble as
any.</p>
            <p>Let me not be branded as a niggard, or
an unſocial fellow, for what I am now going
to ſay. Take it as you pleaſe, I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that there is truth and juſtice in the
remark, that one great ſource of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
at preſent is the practice of extenſive
and indiſcriminate entertaining, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
amongſt us. I remember the time,
when no body dined or ſupped at our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1214100600:14"/>
houſes, but relations or particular friends
and connections, except at the houſes of men
of high rank, or in public offices, who were
therefore obliged, in point of decorum, and
for the purpoſes of good policy, to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
to large and general compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Indifferent people paid us a morning
viſit, or drank a diſh of tea at our houſes in
the afternoon. Whereas now, what a wide
circle of dining and ſupping acquaintance
has every one of us!A man reſolves on
having a dinner or a ſupper. He ſends
about cards, and he is never at reſt till he
has ſecured as many as will fill his table.
The ſlighteſt acquaintance ſuffices for giving
and receiving ſuch invitations; and, from
their being ſo promiſcuous, and ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
round of them, true hoſpitality no
longer exiſts. We aſk chiefly thoſe who will
aſk us again, and we aſk ſo many, that with
one half of them we have no connection,
and no ſuch reciprocation of regard as
ſhould be found between the maſter of a
houſe and his gueſts. On the contrary, it is
very common to find them attack each other
behind their backs, if not with rancorous
abuſe, at leaſt with bitter ſarcaſm, or deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
buffoonery:<q>Non hoſpes ab hoſpite tutus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such indiſcriminate entertaining is the
worſe, that not only do we think ourſelves
obliged to have our tables more plentifully
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1214100600:15"/>
covered than in moſt houſes in London, but
we muſt drink hard upon almoſt every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
I will venture to ſay, that there is
at this time more hard-drinking in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
than in any other country in Europe, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
not excepted. The regular artillery of
the glaſſes, the bumpers, the varieties of
toaſting in ſhort all the
<q>Pride, pomp, and circumſtance of glorious drinking,</q>
are ſtill in full obſervance amongſt us. It
may ſeem extraordinary, that this faſhion
ſhould have increaſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when it is
wearing out both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; but
ſo is moſt certainly the fact; account for it
who will.</p>
            <p>There can be no doubt, that the faſhion
of hard drinking at every table has contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
much to roughen our manners. Our
gentlemen of the laſt age were much more
polite than thoſe of the preſent; they had
their jovial clubs of an evening, but they
roſe from dinner time enough to pay their
compliments to the ladies in the drawing-room.
The Edinburgh Miſcellany, Allan
Ramſay's Tea-table Miſcellany, and even
Mr. Hamilton of Bangour's Poems, which
are of a much later date, ſhew us, that there
was in Scotland a genteel mode of ſociety,
which ſeems now to be quite given up.
Our ladies and gentlemen aſſembled at tea
in the afternoons, where they had the moſt
agreeable opportunities of improving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1214100600:16"/>
in a genteel addreſs and gay conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
Colonel <hi>Forreſter,</hi> who wrote <hi>The
Polite Philoſopher,</hi> was formed in ſuch ſociety.</p>
            <p>Whereas now every drawing-room is like
a nunnery, and the ladies hardly ſee the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
but at ſome public place, where they
often appear when much intoxicated; a
monſtrous degree of indecency, peculiar to
Scotland. Surely being accuſtomed to ſee
men drunk, (a ſituation into which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians
forced their ſlaves, that their youth
might, by beholding its ugly effects, have
an abhorrence at the vice,) muſt not a little
hurt the delicacy of our ladies. Although
the gentlemen ſhould not be what is called
<hi>mortal,</hi> their being inflamed with liquor muſt
make their converſation and behaviour ſuch,
as ought to ſhock our ladies; and, if they
are much accuſtomed to it, ſure I am the
enamel is off their minds, and blunted are
thoſe finer feelings of which an elegant wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ought to be poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>As another proof of our preſent coarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I cannot but obſerve, that, amidſt all
our extravagance, we are ſhamefully defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in dreſs, which is the leaſt hurtful mode
of expence, as it can do no harm either to
body or mind, while it encourages the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of the induſtrious, and affords a pretty
exerciſe for taſte and fancy.</p>
            <p>Negligence, or want of attention to oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
is the ſecond general cauſe of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1214100600:17"/>
Sir <hi>Francis Osborne,</hi> who wrote a
great many years ago in <hi>England,</hi> has a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in his advice to his ſon, which, with a
few variations, might be addreſſed at this
day to numbers in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The ſubſtance
of it will apply; ſo I ſhall give it in his own
words.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">I find the <hi>oeconomicks,</hi> though moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to being, the leaſt eſteemed with our <hi>gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,</hi>
looked upon by ſome as trivial, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as diſhonourable and unbecoming a
maſculine employment; yet a total neglect
of them may be found in experience the ruin
of the greateſt families in <hi>England,</hi> as their
more exact proſecution keeps up men's
eſtates in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the inhabitants are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
as moſt generally wiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not unfitly propoſed in this for an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
pattern, but where they border too
near the confines of penury and baſeneſs,
moſt unbecoming the cuſtom and plenty of
<hi>England</hi>; and where in this particular, (till
the ſword received a commiſſion from GOD
to devour all things good and honourable
in the land,) our noblemen equalled the
princes, and our king exceeded in hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
all the monarchs in the known world;
and might yet have done more, had the true
elements of thrift been maintained in equal
proportion, by providing all things at the
beſt hand, and making uſe of times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
in which I confeſs, ſo much as purely
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1214100600:18"/>
belongs to houſewifery ought, if not in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
yet in reverence to cuſtom, to be
left to women, provided they own abilities
competent for the employment, which is yet
ſometimes ſo far contradicted by experience,
as the firſt leak of a huſband's fortune is
found to riſe in the kitchen, and ſuch rooms
as a man of quality cannot decently viſit.
Nor is there a better way patent to obviate
this falling into a hectic through a dyſentery,
than by an equal balancing all weekly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts;
never noted by wiſdom any more
blemiſh to honour, than to know how many
horſes he keeps in the ſtable, a place that
cannot be denied to be made, by uſe rather
than reaſon, more becoming his preſence
than the paſtry or larder: nor is the keeping
of a regulated expence (magnified rather
than decried in the higheſt courts of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,)
neglected ſo much out of ſcorn as
defect; fathers, eſpecially rich ones, being
ſo far to learn themſelves what is moſt fit
their children ſhould be taught, as they keep
them ſo long in their Latin ſchool, till the
time is lapſed moſt proper for reading, and
to make a perfect accountant, the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
part of the mathematics, and ſo much
as cannot be in any commerce ſpared: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
indubitable, that none, ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as to call himſelf to a weekly, or at leaſt
an annual reckoning, did ever through his
own default ſpend an eſtate; whereas the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1214100600:19"/>
want of this firſt rudiment of thrift hath,
within the compaſs of my experience,
brought divers to a bit of bread, and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
the houſes of the moſt ancient gentry
in <hi>England.</hi> Now, if any deſire to underſtand
how our more illiterate fathers came to eſcape
this curſe, an anſwer lies ready, That the
greateſt part of their revenues did conſiſt in
proviſions of all ſorts, paid punctually at a
day, and ſo eaſily accounted for and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered.
And this abundance they enjoyed
kept them pleaſed, and in friendſhip with
their eſtates, wanting neither company nor
reſpect, through which they became leſs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh
after the glory and ſmall delights of
<hi>London,</hi> and the court, towards which they
did ſeldom look but upon conſtraint, having
never taſted them in youth, as now they do,
the only time to contract an affection to any
place or thing: So as that we call <hi>the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our gentry</hi> is the main reaſon of their
undoing, the glorious aſpects the city affords
rendering the more ſolid pleaſures of the
country contemptible and diſtaſteful. And
thus infatuated, from the hope of a redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by an <hi>office</hi> or <hi>wife,</hi> they drop into an
ocean of debts, between the <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis</hi>
of a <hi>London</hi> and country houſe, which
for want of moderating their expence, (a
thing arithmetic is the readieſt, if not the
only means to reform,) it becomes no leſs
terrible to look upon in relation to <hi>ſolitude</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1214100600:20"/>
and <hi>dilapidations,</hi> than unſafe to abide in for
fear of the <hi>Sheriff.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So far <hi>Sir Francis Osborne.</hi>—And, indeed,
every man of obſervation and reflection muſt
ſubſcribe to the truth of what he has ſaid.
As judicious divines have remarked, that
none who are conſtant in the duty of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
by which their lives are daily reviewed
by them, with at leaſt ſome degree of awe,
will be very wicked; ſo none who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
in keeping accounts will be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant.
But negligence is often produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by extravagance. People perceive their
expence to be ſo great, that they are afraid
to examine into the ſtate of their affairs,
which they know are in a ruinous condition;
but they have not courage to retrieve them,
and abandon themſelves to deſpair. Such is
the ſituation of ſome; but the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe whom I have in my view have
not even an apprehenſion or ſuſpicion of
their danger; they repoſe in ignorant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence,
while debt, like corroding ruſt, is
ſilently and ſurely devouring their ſubſtance:
While thus deluded with eaſy dreams, they
are unſolicitous with regard to their own
expence, and thoughtleſsly become bound
as ſecurity for others, another unhappy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
which is now ſo common, that
to refuſe it will irritate, and you have no
thanks for granting it. And here again <hi>Sir
Francis Osborne</hi> comes in, who cautions his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1214100600:21"/>
ſon in a ſtrong and lively manner, "Such
as are betrayed by their eaſy nature, to be
ordinary ſecurity for their friends, leave ſo
little to themſelves, as their liberty remains
ever after arbitrary at the will of others.
Experience having recorded many (whom
their fathers had left elbow-room enough)
that by ſuretyſhip have expired in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.
But if you cannot avoid this laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
enter no further than the thread of
your own ſtock will reach; the obſervation
of which, will, at worſt, enable you to bail
yourſelf."</p>
            <p>The deſire of being precipitantly rich is
the third general cauſe of bankruptcy. The
old prudent maxims of frugality, by which
our fathers acquired wealth and kept it, or
by which they at leaſt left their fortunes in
no worſe ſituation than they found them,
are exploded; and we muſt all attain to
riches by means of project and adventure.
A few men of enterprize may be of uſe in a
country, but what muſt become of that
country where all are men of enterprize?
The conſequence muſt be, that labourers, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,
traders, and farmers, by all ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
to get into a ſituation higher than that
to which they have any probable means of
attaining, muſt, like the frog in the fable, burſt
in the attempt. Our landed gentlemen again,
obſerving the artificial and temporary riſe
in the price of all proviſions, demand exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1214100600:22"/>
rents, which diſtracted men in ſome
caſes agree to pay; and in other caſes, the
gentlemen think themſelves ſure of getting,
after keeping their grounds for ſometime in
their own poſſeſſion, and laying out large
ſums of money upon their improvement, not
conſidering that in a few years their tenants
break, and that the calculations of profits
which they have framed upon their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
turn out to be fallacious. They are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
if you would hint ſuch things to them
while they are living up to the full extent of
their imaginary rents. Let us ſee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of all this. Our news-papers are filled
with ſales of lands, and the rolls of the court
of ſeſſion crouded with adjudications and
<hi>Ceſſio Bonorums,</hi> in the courſe of which it has
come out, that footmen, common ſoldiers,
and in ſhort the loweſt of mankind, have
obtained credit for hundreds, nay, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of pounds.</p>
            <p>This unhappy ſubject of credit brings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us thoſe numerous banks and banking
companies, that moſt aſtoniſhing circulation
of paper currency, and that amazing multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of caſh accounts which are at this time
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to which many of the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcies
muſt be imputed. Such has been
the rage of making profits by banking, and
ſuch the flattering expectations, that if any
failures did happen, thoſe who iſſued notes
would either be ſo fortunate as not to be the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1214100600:23"/>
ſufferers, or would be indemnified by the
intereſt drawn for their mere paper, that
they have given caſh-accounts to many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who, they could not but be ſenſible, had
neither money nor effects equal to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the ſum; and ſuch men becoming
mutual ſecurity for each other, could not
mend the matter, but only ſerve to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the deluſion, by having the appearance
of ſome ſtrength without any reality.</p>
            <p>In the view of what I have already ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that at the enſuing terms, payments
muſt and will be demanded all over <hi>Scotland,</hi>
with a degree of rigour which we have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before experienced. I would ſay a few
words to three different claſſes of readers;
thoſe who can immediately pay; thoſe who,
if let alone for a time, may be able to pay;
and thoſe who muſt be conſcious that they
neither can at preſent, nor have a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of ever being able to pay.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe who are able to pay, let them
conſider that they are called upon, not only
by juſtice, but by every motive of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not to plead any affected excuſe, or avail
themſelves of any evaſive delays, but on the
contrary, to exert themſelves with the utmoſt
diligence and anxiety, to make punctual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe their failing ſo to do may be
the occaſion of breaking the credit of many,
who, if they could get exact payment of
what is due to them, might ſtill be able to
ſupport themſelves with decency, and be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1214100600:24"/>
uſeful members of ſociety. They ought to
conſider that delaying on this critical and
diſtreſſing occaſion, to pay back the money
which they have borrowed till their creditors
have ſuffered, is like delaying in the time of
a famine to pay back bread, which they have
borrowed, till their neighbours are dead:
nor is it enough that the law is open to all;
for we well know, that, notwithſtanding the
preſent diſpatch in the court of ſeſſion, the
forms which juſtice has deviſed to prevent
crude deciſions being paſſed, and haſty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
being taken, afford an opportunity for
chicane to contrive, that we ſhall feel what
<hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> juſtly enumerates, as one of the
moſt galling evils, "the law's delay;" and a
good deal more is expended on every law-ſuit,
than what is repaid when coſts are allowed.
Beſides, they ought to recollect, that there is
no proportion between the injury done to
<hi>them</hi> by a law-ſuit, and that which is done by
it to men of leſs confirmed credit than theirs.
The blaſts, that hardly ſhake the deep-root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
tree, will tear up one that is not ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly
ſituated.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe who cannot pay immediately,
but, if let alone for a time, may be able to
pay, of which I do believe there will be
found a conſiderable number; I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
them, when puſhed by any of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
candidly and fairly to explain their
ſituation and their proſpects. If they are
gentlemen of eſtates, who have laid out mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1214100600:25"/>
judiciouſly, let them ſhew, that in a few
years they will be able to diſcharge what
they owe, and be richer than at preſent.
Gentlemen who have eſtates are however the
leaſt to be pitied; for, if their improvements
be ſolid, they may always command credit;
but thoſe who have laid out their borrowed
money in farming or in trade, in the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of conſiderable profits, and of being
allowed to pay off their debt gradually as
their profits come in, muſt be in a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
ſituation, if a ſudden demand is made
upon them. Let them then be in condition
to lay their circumſtances before their credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
both with accuracy and openneſs, ſo
as to obtain their confidence and ſympathy,
while they may at the ſame time demonſtrate
to them, that it will be their own intereſt to
have patience, as harſh meaſures would have
the effect to forfeit thoſe leaſes, and fruſtrate
thoſe advantageous ſchemes, which would in
time afford a fund for full payment, inſtead
of the ſmall ſhare which would now be
drawn. I would hope, that following the
rules, which have been now pointed out,
may be attended with very beneficial conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe who muſt be conſcious, that
they neither can at preſent, nor have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of ever being able to pay. I would
earneſtly exhort them to brave it out no
longer—no longer to go on accumulating
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1214100600:26"/>
diſtreſs on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>hers, and guilt on themſelves;
they can never have a better opportunity
for ſtopping than the preſent time, when
they have ſo many neighbours to keep them
in countenance. I would adviſe them too,
to ſeize the opportunity for another reaſon,
which may ſtrike a knell to ſome of their
hearts; for next ſeſſion of parliament, an act
may be paſſed againſt fraudulent, and even
prodigal bankrupts, fraught with ſuch ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as I wiſh from my ſoul had been paſſed
ſeveral years ago. All of them will yet meet
with the greater indulgence the ſooner they
diſcover themſelves, and I promiſe them
they will find much more eaſe in their own
minds than in their preſent ſtate, when they
are miſerably aſſuming a falſe appearance,
and hourly in terror of detection; while
every man whom they do not know they
ſuſpect to be a meſſenger, and every pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
that is delivered to them, they dread
contains a charge of horning.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude without expreſſing my
hopes, that the late bankruptcies, however
diſtreſſing to individuals, deſerving and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving,
may be of general utility, if they
have the effect which we may ſuppoſe they
will have on every rational and well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
perſon, by reſtoring juſt notions of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,
frugality, and every other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
by which the good order of ſociety is
maintained.</p>
