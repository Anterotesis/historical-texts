            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A VOYAGE to the Iſland of LOVE.</head>
            <p>IT is but juſt, dear <hi>Bellamour,</hi> that I ſhould let you hear from me; and that after a Year's Abſence, you ſhou'd at laſt be deliver'd from the Uneaſineſs, which the Uncertainty of my Fate has undoubtedly given you. I have ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the World ſince my leaving you, but am not ſure whether, in my preſent Condition, I ſhall have Reſolution enough to give you any tolerable Account of my Travels: 'Tis adding to my preſent Affliction to call to mind my paſt Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1010300800:3"/>
and 'tis increaſing my preſent Pain, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my old Wounds bleed aſreſh, to take a Survey, even in Imagination, of thoſe Pleaſures, whereof nothing now is remaining but cruel Remembrance. I believe however, that it will be no ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to me, to communicate to one of my beſt Friends, both my paſt Pleaſures and Afflictions; Complaining is ſome Eaſe to a Perſon in Miſery; I ſhall forget my Sorrows whilſt I am relating my Adventures, and for a Moment make a Truce with my Heart-breaking Anguiſh.</p>
            <p>'Tis now about a Year, as you may remember, ſince I embark'd on the wide Ocean, with ſeveral other Perſons, of <hi>all Ages,</hi> and <hi>Conditions,</hi> but moſt of them <hi>very giddy-headed,</hi> in ſearch of a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Country,</hi> named <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> whereof we had all of us heard a moſt inchanting Deſcription. Charm'd with the Thoughts of the Delights we were there to enjoy, we ſail'd for ſome Days peaceably, and nothing was to be heard but Mirth and Gayety, from one End of the Veſſel to the other; when pretty near an Iſland, where we intended to have taken in Reſreſhments, there aroſe ſo ſurious a Tempeſt, and the Wind was ſo boiſterous, that in ſpite of the utmoſt Skill and Endeavours of the Pilot, it drove us with Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to a Coaſt quite oppoſite to that to which we were bound: In this Condition, we were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1010300800:4"/>
toſs'd up and down, between four and five Days; after which the Weather began to clear up, the Sun ſhone out with greater Luſtre than ever, and we found our ſelves not far off of a beautiful Iſland, which ſeem'd almoſt cover'd with the moſt delightful Gardens, or rather, which ſeem'd one continued Garden, and a ſecond terreſtrial Paradiſe. Raviſh'd with the numberleſs Beauties, which every where offer'd themſelves to our Eye, we were all curious to know the Name of that inviting Country, imagining it that to which we were bound, and that the Pilot had put an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Cheat upon us, when he inform'd us that we had been driven ſo far out of our Way. But there happen'd to be a Man on board the Ship who undeceived us, having before made the Tour of the Iſland; accordingly he gave us the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Information.</p>

            <p>In the mean while Ten or a Dozen little Boats looſed from the Shore; theſe Boats were all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh'd with the moſt beauteous Flowers, and their Cordage was of Silk, of a hundred different Colours.

            <p>When they were come up with our Veſſel, we were entertained with an admirable Concert

            <p>At the ſame Time the <hi>Zephyrs</hi> hovering around us, ſtretched out their Hands, and with a ſweet Smile ſeemed to invite us to accompany them. All theſe ſurprizing Wonders had charmed me to ſuch a Degree, that I was no longer Maſter of myſelf: That inchanting Beauty whom I had ſeen, and whom I burnt with Impatience of Rejoining, with ſomewhat, I know not what, that ſeized my Heart at the ſame Inſtant, made me reſolve to go aſhore upon the Iſland; accordingly I held out my Hands, and the <hi>Zephyrs</hi> took me up, and carried me into a Boat, where the little <hi>Cupids</hi> received me with a thouſand Demonſtrations of Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral in our Veſſel who followed my Example, but there were others likewiſe who ſtay'd behind, and laugh'd at us, inſomuch that I was aſtoniſhed at their Inflexibility, when they cry'd after us jearing;</p>

            <p>Accordingly I went on without minding her <hi>Preaching,</hi> and ran full of Impatience towards the Place, where I had ſeen the inchanting Creature, who had induced me to land in that Country; but juſt as I approached her, a Man whom I ſaw near her, ſtruck a Terror into me with a ſingle Look. He was tall, and of a good Mein, but very grave and ſerious; his Eyes were very modeſt, and his

Aſpect very ſubmiſſive, and when he looked upon me, he held his Finger upon his Mouth, like the Figure of the God <hi>Silence.</hi> A young Maiden accompanied him, who trode in his very Steps, and mimick'd his every Action and Geſture, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at every Turn round about her to ſee if ſhe was obſerved. A little <hi>Love,</hi> who from that Time devoted himſelf to my Service, to bear me Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in my Travels, and to inſtruct me, gave me the following Information.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Being inſtructed by ſuch a good Maſter, I paid great Civility to <hi>Reſpect,</hi> and <hi>Precaution,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired their Friendſhip, which they both granted me with a very good Grace: This done, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced

trembling towards the fair One, who had charm'd me, and begged her to do me the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to let me hand her, which ſhe granted with Haughtineſs enough; and after having talked for ſome Time about Things indifferent, ſhe left me and went her Way.</p>
            <p>As Night drew on, <hi>Love</hi> conducted me to a little Village, that was very near, where I had a very ſorry Lodging: This Village is called <hi>Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> from the Name of the Lady of the Mannor, to whom we made a Viſit. It is hardly poſſible to give you a tolerable Deſcription of this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for ſhe cannot ſit one Moment in the ſame Place, or Poſture: One Minute ſhe is ſtanding, another Minute ſhe lies down; ſometimes ſhe walks a Snail's Pace, at another Time ſhe runs ſo ſwift it is impoſſible to keep up with her; ſhe never ſleeps, which makes her very lean and hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; then ſhe is very negligent of herſelf, having her Hair always diſhevell'd, and in terrible Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, but eſpecially about her Forehead, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe is oſten rubbing it. After having paid my Reſpects to her, whereof ſhe took no Manner of Notice, I went to my Lodging, and laid me down upon a Bed, but could get no Reſt, the beautiful Charmer being always preſent in my Thought, which cauſed me to make the following Reflection.</p>

            <p>I returned early next Morning to <hi>Courtſhip,</hi> where I was daily better and better treated by <hi>Zelinda,</hi> inſomuch that the Nights, which I was forced to paſs at <hi>Anxiety,</hi> gave me very little Diſquiet; but after ſome Time, having done all that lay in my Power to appear agreeable in <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>'s Eyes, ſhe went one Day to another Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, which is call'd, <hi>Good Reception,</hi> from the Name of the Lord of the Manor, who is the moſt obliging and moſt complaiſant Man in the World: He is mighty eaſy of Acceſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives every Body very well. The Inhabitants of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1010300800:15"/>
the Place are likewiſe mighty civil; and <hi>Zelinda</hi> being willing to be conformable, after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, treated me very obligingly, and gave me Room to imagine, by her Behaviour, that ſhe was not at all diſpleaſed at the Sight of me.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Love</hi> conducted me to <hi>Hope,</hi> where I took up my Lodging, it being a large and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful City, vaſtly populous, by Reaſon of the daily Arrival of Thouſands, who flock thither from all Parts. Nevertheleſs, the greateſt Part of this City is built upon <hi>Sand,</hi> and without any <hi>Foundation,</hi> which makes it very often fall to Ruin; But the other Part ſtands upon a pretty good Foundation: for which Reaſon, it has almoſt, always, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in its firſt State. This whole City is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon the River <hi>Pretenſions,</hi> which takes its Riſe from a Mountain of the ſame Name, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon <hi>Hope.</hi> This River is perfectly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, but it is dangerous imbarking thereon, which is the very Reaſon, why the Houſes built upon its Banks are generally thrown down; but whilſt they remain ſtanding, the fineſt Palaces don't e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual them for Beauty of their Proſpect.</p>
            <p>This pleaſant River is famous for the Ruin of divers illuſtrious Perſons; nevertheleſs, I was tempted to bathe myſelf therein; and <hi>Love</hi> would have let me plunge in inconſiderately enough when I met <hi>Reſpect,</hi> followed by <hi>Precaution,</hi> who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1010300800:16"/>
ſtop'd me by the Arm, and told me, that it was the ready Way to ruin me, and that I ought to be contented with continuing in <hi>Hope,</hi> without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to expoſe myſelf in the dangerous River <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon I thank'd him for his good Advice, and took a Walk towards that Part of the Town which is fartheſt from the River: There it is that the Palace of the Princeſs <hi>Hope</hi> ſtands, who is reckoned the Oracle of the Iſland of <hi>Love,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not very ſafe relying upon what ſhe ſays; for,</p>

            </q>
            <p>By entering her Palace, one meets the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> which are always upon the Wing, and fly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>high,</hi> ſometimes <hi>low,</hi> and ſometimes in the <hi>Middle of the Air;</hi> according as the Fancy takes them; for my Part, I happened upon ſuch as were diſcreet enough, for they always kept an even Flight. I went afterwards to ſee the Princeſs <hi>Hope,</hi> who is actually a very amiable Lady:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1010300800:17"/>
She has a perpetual Smile in her Countenance, and a moſt ſweet, and moſt engaging Look; one is never tired of her Company; ſhe comforts the moſt afflicted, animates the Courage of the Proud, and flatters agreeably thoſe who are not unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their Deſires: when I went to pay her my Reſpects, two Men entered her Apartment, at the ſame Time, with me; one whereof had placed his Affections on one ſo much his Superior, that he durſt not promiſe himſelf any good Iſſue from his Paſſion; and the other, who was in the ſame Caſe, hoped for all Things from his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune! I muſt own, I could not help admiring the artful Addreſs of the Princeſs, in comforting one and animating the other: To the firſt ſhe ſaid,</p>

            <p>As for my Part, when I had told my Caſe,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1010300800:18"/>
as ſhe found me not to be unreaſonable, ſhe ſaid,</p>
            <q>

            <p>Although I very well knew, that ſhe conſtantly flattered every Body, I could not help being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with her Anſwer; and it left ſuch a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Impreſſion upon my Mind, that I reſted bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Night than I had done ſome Time before; and the next Morning <hi>Love</hi> would have conducted me to <hi>Declaration:</hi> But as we were on the Way thither, we were again met by <hi>Reſpect,</hi> who was very much out of Humour, and told me, that I ought not to be in ſuch Poſt-Haſte; he even repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Love</hi> pretty ſharply, which the little Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant not being able to bear, with any Manner of Patience, cryed out in a great Paſſion,</p>

            <p>Hereupon <hi>Reſpect</hi> told him that ſhould not be my Caſe, and that, if I would be adviſed by him, my Paſſion ſhould be ſoon known without going to <hi>Declaration:</hi> That, as for the reſt, I ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find <hi>Zelinda</hi> at the Place to which he would conduct me, whereas ſhe would, perhaps ſtay but one Day at <hi>Declaration,</hi> after which I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee her more. I ſuffered myſelf to be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, by theſe Reaſons, notwithſtanding all that <hi>Love</hi> could urge to the contrary, and went with him to a ſtrong Fortreſs whereof he is Governor: It is a Citadel well fortified with ſeveral impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Baſtions, whoſe Walls are ſo high, that the Eye cannot reach the Top of them, and ſo ſtrong, and ſo thick, that it is impoſſible to ſhake them.</p>

               <hi>Modeſty, Silence,</hi> and <hi>Secreſy</hi> guard the only Gate there is to this Fortreſs, which, nevertheleſs is but a very little Wicket. <hi>Modeſty</hi> is a Woman of great Gravity, but without affecting to appear ſo; her Eyes have a reſolute Look, accompanied with a great deal of Reſervedneſs; and ſhe goes always very

She is a Lady of great Beauty, though not of the Sort that pleaſes at firſt Sight; but they who are uſed to her Company are very fond of her Converſation; Her Eyes are inexpreſſibly piercing and lively, inſomuch, that when they pleaſe, they can make themſelves underſtood by every Body; and ſhe has the Look of a Perſon of the greateſt Modeſty and Reſervedneſs, through which, nevertheleſs, one may diſcover abundance of Addreſs and Wit, which ſhe never fails to make uſe of, whenever ſhe ſees Occaſion.</p>
            <p>After paying my Reſpects to her, I inquired artfully where <hi>Zelinda</hi> lodged, which, when I was informed, I took up my Quarters in a Houſe that was a good Diſtance from thence, and even when I chanced to meet her, all my Diſcourſe was upon Subjects quite different from Love: Thus did I continue a conſiderable Time in the Citadel,

leading a very miſerable Life, and holding no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with any.</p>

Thus did I make all the neighbouring Ecchoes reſound with my Complaints; never having any Reſt, nor ceaſing from ſhedding Floods of Tears: My uſual Employment was to walk round the Rock, where I ſometimes met <hi>Zelinda,</hi> but ſhe was always in Company with <hi>Cruelty,</hi> whom I endeavour'd in vain to mollify by all Manner of Submiſſions.

Several diſconſolate Lovers walk along the Sides of the Lake, and I ſaw ſome who threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into it headlong; I was once tempted to do the ſame, but before I attempted to put the deſperate Deſign in Execution, (a Deſign to which Nature is always repugnant) I imagin'd it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon ſecond Thoughts to endeavour once more to mollify <hi>Zelinda,</hi> and that Monſter <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</hi> To this Purpoſe, I went and laid myſelf at the Entrance of the Cave, with a firm Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never to ſtir from thence, till I ſhould ſee <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi> come out. There it was, that by a Flood of Tears, and innumerable heart-breaking Sighs, I made my Complaints heard even to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Cave, for which I was frequently very ill uſed by <hi>Cruelty;</hi> In ſhort, I believe I ſhould at laſt have ſunk under my Pains, if <hi>Love</hi> had not given me a Piece of very wholeſome Counſel, which ſav'd my Life. One Day, when I was ſwallow'd up with Grief, I ſaw a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Maiden paſs by me, who ſhed Tears as ſhe looked upon me, and ſeem'd by her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to beſtow thoſe Tears upon my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In order to follow his Counſel, I endeavour'd to prevail upon <hi>Pity,</hi> by letting her know my deplorable Condition, which ſhe was ſo much moved with, that ſhe promis'd to uſe her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Efforts to aſſiſt me: Accordingly it was not long before ſhe made me ſenſible of the good Effects of her Promiſes; for taking a Turn round the Rock ſhe at laſt diſcover'd <hi>Zelinda,</hi> and with Tears in her Eyes gave her an Account of my melancholy Condition, and that in ſuch moving Language that it drew likewiſe Tears from the beauteous Eyes of the inhuman Fair One. <hi>Pity</hi> finding ſhe had moved her Compaſſion, conducted her to the Place where I lay, and ſhew'd her the miſerable State to which ſhe had reduced me; <hi>Zelinda</hi> could not help being ſenſibly affected with the melancholy Sight, and accordingly, not only began to give Ear to my amorous Reproaches,

in the World, always the ſame; and there is no manner of Reſtraint, but every one enjoys full Liberty in her Houſe. There it is that Lovers keep their <hi>Rendezvous,</hi> in little winding Groves, whoſe Avenues are very ſecret, and where they are not diſturbed.</p>
            <p>There it is that they have the Pleaſure of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with each other the whole Day without being tired: And there it is that they ſee each other every Hour, and yet think they don't ſee each other enough.

I remain'd immoveable at this Sight, and ſaw her go away without ſpeaking one Word; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after ſome Heſitation, my firſt Reſolution was to run after her, and wreſt her from the Arms of <hi>Duty</hi> by main Force; but <hi>Reſpect,</hi> and <hi>Precaution,</hi> who happen'd to come by very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, prevented me: This accidental Meeting anger'd me at the firſt, but I had always reap'd ſo much Benefit by their Advice, that I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſtill to follow it.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I retired to a neighbouring Deſart, which ſeemed agreeable to my Humour: 'I'is a large Valley, ſurrounded with ſeveral Mountains, and very remote from all Manner of Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where there is a Caſtle ſituated in the midſt of a great Wood, which is the continual Abode of a melancholy Female, called, <hi>Abſence:</hi> She is very ſeldom to be ſeen, having her Eyes always drowned in Tears, and being conſequently very much dejected, and disfigured: She is always in Mourning, and perpetually accompanied by <hi>Thoughtfulneſs,</hi> who is alſo mighty lean, never fixing her Eyes long upon any ſingle Object, but looking upon every Thing, and yet ſeeing No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: She takes no Notice, nor gives the leaſt Attention to any Thing; neither does ſhe ever ſpeak, but quite foreign to the Purpoſe, and hardly ever gives an Anſwer to what is asked of her; in

ſhort, ſhe ſeems to be collected within herſelf, and to love no Company but her own. The Fall of Waters, and their ſoft Murmers, and the ſinging of Birds, are her ordinary Diverſions. Hereupon I entered into a ſtrict Friendſhip with her, and conformed myſelf entirely to her Manner of living; retiring, with my Sorrows to the greateſt Solitudes, and converſing alone, in the ſame Manner as ſhe, with the Woods, the Brooks, the Ecchoes, and the Springs.</p>
               <p>In the mean while I ſuffered a Thouſand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Torments, having always a longing Deſire to ſee <hi>Zelinda,</hi> and not being able to ſatisfy that Deſire; what I thought moſt grievous of all, in that Place, was, that the Time is longer than in any other Place in the World, the Moments being Hours, the Hours Days, and the Days Years: Beſides this, one meets every where with <hi>Troubles,</hi> which are great gigantick Mortals of a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable Aſpect; and they are ſo numerous that there's no avoiding them.

Means to get conveyed to me; nevertheleſs, I ſhould not have lived long, if <hi>Zelinda</hi>'s having, at laſt, got free from <hi>Duty,</hi> had not recalled me from my Exile. This made me, in a Moment, forget all my paſt Pains, and run to ſee her again with all the Impatience of an ardent Lover; but I was not much happier for the Change of my Condition; for I found her in a Place, where no one yet ever enjoyed any Repoſe.</p>

               <p>This Place is called the <hi>Rivals,</hi> whither I was no ſooner come but I ſaw ſeveral Perſons about <hi>Zelinda,</hi> who redden'd with Anger, on ſeeing me, and prevented my ſpeaking to her. I felt within myſelf a ſecret Hatred, and Averſion to them all; and a little after, thinking, that <hi>Zelinda</hi> looked upon them too kindly, I ſuffered myſelf to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by <hi>Love</hi> to the Palace of <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> which is adjacent to the <hi>Rivals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1010300800:36"/>
This Palace is yet a much more diſagreeable Place than any of the reſt; for even <hi>Abſence</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> don't make one ſuffer half the Ills, that one ſuffers in <hi>Jealouſy:</hi> Continual Winds, Rains, and Tempeſts, render this a very unpleaſant Place to reſide in; the Thunder growls there perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally over one's Head, and the Sky is very dark, and multiplies every Object; the leaſt Shaddow ſtrikes one there with Terrour, and the whole Place is full of Precipices, where People are often loſt, by Reaſon of the Darkneſs that reigns through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Whole.</p>
               <p>At the Entrance of this Palace, We meet with <hi>Paſſion, Idle Fancies,</hi> and <hi>Perturbation of Mind,</hi> which bewitch the Eyes in ſuch a Manner, that one ſees every Thing the wrong Way. <hi>Paſſion</hi> is always in a Fury, without knowing any Reaſon why, ſpeaks very precipitately, and ſays every Thing unreaſonably, and without any Order or Connection: <hi>Perturbation of Mind</hi> is ſtartled and diſturbed at the leaſt Thing in the World, and is aſtoniſhed at a meer Nothing; And <hi>Idle Fancies</hi> are always creating their own Misfortunes, becauſe they form to themſelves vain Phantoms, which prove their own Torment. All theſe Perſons, at my Entrance, made me take a certain Draught, which transformed me into quite another Man than I was before.</p>

            <p>In this miſerable State I went to viſit <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,</hi> who is very ugly, and very lean, beſides her being cover'd with Serpents, which are perpetually gnawing her Entrails. Her Look is full of Horrour, and ſhe ſees not any Thing which ſhe does not envy. As ſoon as I entered the Room where ſhe was, ſhe threw one of her Serpents at me, which, in the Fury I was then in, exaſperated me yet ten times more; inſomuch that I ran up and down every where, without knowing whither I was going, or to what End. When I met <hi>Zelinda</hi> in Company, I durſt not approach her, and trembled in my very Soul, but then I endeavour'd to overhear what was ſaid to her, and her Anſwers, and I wreſted every Word ſhe ſpoke to ſuch a Senſe as might torment my ſelf. When any one whiſper'd her, I turn'd as pale as Death immediately, and interpreted the leaſt Action, and the leaſt Geſture in Favour of others; and when I did not ſee her, I imagin'd her in the Arms of ſome happier Rival: If ſhe was alone, I fancy'd ſhe was waiting for ſome Body; in ſhort in my Phrenzy I was jealous of

            <p>In the mean While, <hi>Zelinda,</hi> who ſaw my Weakneſs, did but ſmile at it, at the Beginning; but afterwards ſhe reſented it highly, and then it was that I became acquainted with a Man who would have cured me, both of my <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,</hi> at the ſame Time; his Name was <hi>Spite.</hi>

At laſt my Tears and Intreaties, together with the natural Inclination ſhe had for me, as ſhe had confeſs'd to me at <hi>Confidence,</hi> prevail'd on her to receive me again into Favour: In ſhort, after many Difficulties, We arrived at the Metropolis of the Kingdom of <hi>Love,</hi> which is call'd after the Name of the Iſland, and where the Court is kept, which is beyond Expreſſion ſplendid and agreeable; being compoſed of all Sorts of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Ranks, and Degrees, Kings, Princes, and Subjects; notwithſtanding which, no one there is a greater Man than another.</p>
            <p>This City is very large, and every Thing there is in Confuſion; Perſons of Merit are join'd there very often with thoſe who have none; and ſuch as are handſome frequently leave all for thoſe that are homely; which ſufficiently ſhews that the God who preſides there is blind. In the Middle of the City is a very famous Temple, which is older than the World, for <hi>Love</hi> was there when he unravell'd the Chaos. This Temple is very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, notwithſtanding which, it is hardly large enough to receive all the Sacrifices that are offer'd up there every Day.</p>
            <p>We went thither alſo, to offer up our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices according to Cuſtom, and on our Entrance were obliged to deliver up the Victims, which were our Hearts: <hi>Zelinda</hi> ſtill made ſome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty

of parting with hers, but <hi>Deſire</hi> at laſt ſnatch'd it away, not without ſome little Violence. Our Hearts then were offered up in Sacrifices to <hi>Love,</hi> and the Flame, which burnt them, did not conſume them, inſomuch that after the Sacrifice, we found them ſtill both entire, but burning:</p>

            <p>Behold me then, arriv'd at the Height of all my Wiſhes; I continued therefore ſome Time in the City, enjoying all the Pleaſures whereof Man is capable, in being tenderly beloved; that is to ſay:</p>

            <p>This numerous Company which attended him were very much out of Order, being all ſickly Women who cou'd not keep up with him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Difficulties: <hi>Love,</hi> which has taken entire Poſſeſſion of all the Faculties of their Soul, makes them hourly languiſh and pine away, till they are as lean as Skeletons, whilſt their dying Eyes betray their Hearts, and make it viſible to every one, that the <hi>little God</hi> in ſpite of all their Reſiſtance, maintains his Empire there.</p>

            <p>I muſt own to You that one is very happy in that Place; as for my Part, when I conſider'd that I was arrived at the Height of all my Wiſhes, I thought I cou'd never be ſufficiently ſatisfy'd with my good Fortune; but my Happineſs was too great to be laſting, accordingly I ſoon ſaw the End of it, as you will obſerve: But ſome Days before, as I was walking, I met with a Maiden who was but homely, but who was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs very affected, and never ſatisfy'd with any Thing. She has no ſettled Abode, becauſe ſhe takes no Care to provide herſelf of any one, even the moſt agreeable Things being irkſome to her, her Name is <hi>Coldneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She has a great Power in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Love;</hi> for they who will hearken to her Counſel, ſoon leave it without any Trouble or Regret, for ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts them to the Bay of <hi>Diſguſt,</hi> where there are but too many Veſſels ready to carry one away. I ſaw ſeveral who went along with her, but I thought her ſo homely and ſo unreaſonable, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1010300800:48"/>
I wou'd not ſtay one Moment with her, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Palace of <hi>True Pleaſure,</hi> where ſome Days after I met with a Misfortune, which ſtill makes a deep Impreſſion upon me, and which I never expect to ſee an End of.</p>
            <p>One Morning in the Midſt of all my Pleaſures, I ſaw a Man who came ſaucily to interrupt them; his Mien was majeſtick and independent, and his Look haughty; and by his Eyes, and the whole Air of his Face one might ſee that he was one that was abſolute, and knew not what it was to obey. In a Word, it was <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> whoſe Decrees are irrevocable, who forced <hi>Zelinda</hi> from my Arms. All my Efforts to detain her were in vain, he took her away, and carried her I know not whither, for I have not been able to hear of her ſince.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I immediately left the Palace of <hi>True Pleaſure,</hi> which ſeem'd diſagreeable to me, ſince <hi>Zelinda</hi> was no longer there, and retired to the Place where I now am, and where I believe I ſhall paſs thoſe few remaining Days which my Sorrows will allow me. I am here upon the Top of a Mountain call'd the <hi>Deſart of Remembrance;</hi> its Solitude is very agreeable, but what is very vexatious is, that the Place is ſo high that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks the whole <hi>Iſland of Love;</hi> inſomuch that one has always one's Misfortune before one's Eyes,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1010300800:49"/>
and can't help ſeeing the Places through which one has paſs'd, and this it is that makes me miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for which Way ſoever I turn, I find al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome Objects which recall my paſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to my Remembrance.</p>
            <p>I have now languiſh'd here for ſome Time, and at laſt conſider'd that you wou'd have ſome Reaſon to complain of me, dear <hi>Bellamour,</hi> if I did not let you hear from me before my Death. Farewell, mourn my Misfortune, perhaps you may one Day ſtand in need of the ſame Conſolation.</p>

            <p>THE Country which I am going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to you, is an Iſland of a vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and indiſputably the moſt populous of any Country in the Univerſe. There is no Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of entering it, but in Couples, a Man and a Woman, whence it happens, that there is always an equal Number of both Sexes therein: For, no ſooner has any one ſet his Foot in it, but there is a ſtrong Guard placed continually at the Mouths of the Harbours, which prevents all Perſons whatſoever, from ſtirring from thence, but on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of having their Partners carried to the Grave, and being themſelves tranſported to the <hi>Peninſula</hi> of <hi>Widowhood,</hi> which is at one of the Ends of the Iſland.</p>

Nor is this Precaution needleſs; for were it not for theſe Guards, this Iſland, as populous as it is, would ſoon be a meer Deſert; for, notwithſtanding Thouſands of Strangers are flocking thither every Day from all Parts, being induced thereunto by the Spirit of Curioſity, the firſt Ruin of Mankind, it is very certain that moſt of the Inhabitants would ſoon ſwarm out again by Millions, did not theſe numerous Guards render it impracticable.</p>
            <p>There is no Way to arrive at this vaſt Region, but by two Ports; the one whereof is called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> and the other <hi>Love.</hi> The firſt of theſe is a <hi>trading Port,</hi> full of immenſe Riches, where <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers</hi> keep a <hi>perpetual Fair,</hi> to <hi>put off</hi> their <hi>Daughters,</hi> who are ſet out for Sale in their Warehouſes, and are diſpoſed of for good round Sums in ready Money. But there is one Thing very particular in the Way of trading of theſe Gentry; for whereas other Dealers expect Money in Return for their Goods, theſe give a handſome Price to thoſe who will take their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize off their Hands. The Port of <hi>Intereſt</hi> is <hi>open</hi> on all Sides, and one may enter it with any Wind.</p>
            <p>The other is a moſt agreeable Port, abounding with all imaginable Pleaſures: The People live there in a perpetual Spring, and the Trees, which are ever green, are always full of Birds, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1010300800:52"/>
make the Air reſound with their Love inſpiring Harmony. The only Wind that carries into this Port, is a gentle Gale called <hi>Sighs,</hi> and one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enters therein with Delight; but very often before one can get in, there ariſes <hi>ſudden Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,</hi> which come from the high Mountain of <hi>Parents,</hi> drive the Veſſels back into open Sea, and prevent their putting into Port. Nevertheleſs when the above-mentioned Gale is good, and perſeveres conſtantly in blowing from the Region of <hi>Sighs,</hi> it ſeldom fails of getting the better of <hi>theſe Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes,</hi> and bringing Paſſengers ſafe into Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>When one comes firſt within Sight of this Iſland, and takes a View of it afar off, before one's entering the Port, nothing can ſeem either more inviting, or more agreeable. One is entertain'd on all Sides with enchanting Proſpects, that form beautiful Landſkips to diſtant Beholders, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Eye moſt egregiouſly; but no ſooner has one once ſet Foot aſhore, but in Proportion as one advances up into the Country, one perceives that thoſe Plains, which ſeemed before, when at a Diſtance, to be covered with a lively Verdure, to be enamelled with Flowers, and to flouriſh with all the Beauties of the jolly Spring, are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with Briars and Thorns, and full of dark and melancholly Vales, divided by Torrents, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1010300800:53"/>
Precipices, abounding with intricate and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Roads, that are croſſed by Moraſſes, which render them unpaſſable. One finds alſo that thoſe beautiful riſing Grounds, which one fancied co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with little verdant Groves, are nothing but Heaps of ſteep Rocks, between the mournful Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, which overſhade them; beſides which, they are full of wild Beaſts, Dragons, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</p>
            <p>Thus 'tis evident that this Iſland affords two very different Proſpects; one, which is very agreeable, to thoſe who have not yet ſet Foot thereon, and only view it at a Diſtance; and another, which is highly diſagreeable, to thoſe who have run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wilfully into that Confinement, and who are no ſooner inthralled therein, but they offer up their moſt ardent Vows, for that dear Liberty, which they have given up ſo imprudently; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it is juſt the ſame with them, as with the Goldfinch and the Cage.</p>

            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Marriage</hi> is divided into five Provinces, which have each of them a Capital City, and ſeveral little Towns dependent thereon. Four of theſe Provinces extend themſelves along the four Sea Coaſts, but the largeſt, which is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peopled by the Colonies that flock thither from the other four, is in the Center of the Iſland, the Government whereof it has uſurped, through the prodigious Number of its Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The four Provinces which lye along the Sea Coaſts, are inhabited by the <hi>Diſcreet,</hi> the <hi>Ill-match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> the <hi>Ill-at-Eaſe,</hi> and the <hi>Jealous:</hi> The Head Province, which is in the Middle, is the famous <hi>Cuckoldſhire,</hi> whoſe Capital is the well-known <hi>Hornborough.</hi> But beſides theſe five Provinces, there are likewiſe two <hi>Peninſulas,</hi> the one of <hi>Widowhood,</hi> and the other of <hi>Divorce,</hi> which have taken up two Necks of Land, at two Ends of this Iſland.</p>
            <p>The Province of the <hi>Diſcreet,</hi> who were formerly called the <hi>Faithful,</hi> extends itſelf along the whole
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1010300800:57"/>
               <hi>Eaſtern Coaſt.</hi> Its Capital City is called <hi>Sophia;</hi> its Buildings are modeſt and regular, its Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions good, and capable of making a reſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; it is water'd by <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> which is a River, whoſe pure Stream flows ſoftly, and without Noiſe, although in its Courſe, it is enlarged by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of four Rivulets, called <hi>Piety, Auſterity, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and <hi>Vigilance:</hi> Theſe have nothing agreeable in them, becauſe they only run in Meanders, and their Sides are every where covered with Briars, and Thickets, which prevent the Incurſions of the Scouts of <hi>Amathontis,</hi> who might otherwiſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to land there.</p>
            <p>The Governour of this City is <hi>Prince Integrity,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Honour</hi> is the Civil Magiſtrate; their Churches are always open, they live there with Frugality, and enjoy no Pleaſures but what are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. The Publick Walks where they take the Air, are all planted with <hi>Linden</hi> Trees, that are ſprung from thoſe into which <hi>Baucis</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> were changed; and all their Fences are Palliſadoes of <hi>Laurel,</hi> ſprung from the <hi>chaſt Daphne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs as delightful and well governed as this City is, one can ſcarcely imagine how very few Inhabitants there are therein; and were it not for the <hi>Prudes,</hi> who have found the Means to get Admittance into it, under the borrowed Maſk of Virtue, this Province would be almoſt a Deſart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1010300800:58"/>
Theſe <hi>Prudes</hi> then poſſeſs the largeſt Part of this City, and inhabit a Quarter, which is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the others by the <hi>Obſcure,</hi> a little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver overſhaded with Trees, which ſhield it from the Beams of the Sun, and diſembogues itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Black Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Houſes on the Outſide, are not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from thoſe of the <hi>Diſcreet;</hi> but when my Lord <hi>Honour</hi> goes from Time to Time, and makes a narrow Inſpection into the Inſide of their Tenements, he finds ſo vaſt a Difference between their outward Appearance, and their Management within Doors, that he is often forced to baniſh them, and to ſend large Colonies of them to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Head Province.</p>
            <p>The Metropolis being ſo poorly inhabited, it may be well thought that the Country-Towns and Villages are yet worſe. In effect, one meets only with a few ſcattered up and down, and almoſt without Inhabitants; and even theſe are of ſuch a churliſh untractable Temper, that a Paſſenger is hard put to it to find a Lodging.</p>
            <p>Although thoſe who are really <hi>diſcreet,</hi> are <hi>haughty</hi> and <hi>reſerved,</hi> they behave themſelves with yet leſs Haughtineſs than the <hi>Prudes;</hi> there are no People in the World who extol their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to ſuch a Degree as they, or make ſuch a Noiſe about their Virtue, inſomuch that they treat all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1010300800:59"/>
their Neighbours with the utmoſt Contempt: But although they affect to ſeem wonderfully intrepid, and to be eager for the Combat, they often prove not to be ſo brave, as they would be thought by their Diſcourſe; and the <hi>Amathontins</hi> ſeldom at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to invade their Territories, without making conſiderable Havock among them.</p>
            <p>Even amongſt the real <hi>Diſcreet,</hi> one may find two different Sorts; one of theſe are ſo through a Principle of Honour, and are always as chearful, as they are invincible; but there are others, whoſe Chaſtity is more owing to their Vanity, than their Virtue; theſe have always a ſullen Gravity in their Looks, which ſufficiently demonſtrates, that they are not at all pleaſed with their Condition.</p>
            <p>As little inhabited as the Country is, and as ſevere as the Laws of their Government are, it does not prevent ſome, and thoſe even of the <hi>moſt Diſcreet,</hi> from removing daily into the Head Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; for, in ſhort, Virtue, as well as the Mind, grows weary of too intenſe an Application to one Point, and is apt to abate of its firſt Severity; but thoſe who ſtay behind, look upon theſe Deſerters with Contempt, for which Reaſon, they have ſet up the following Inſcription over the Front of their principal Gate.</p>

It is watered by two Rivers, one whereof is called the <hi>Fantaſque,</hi> and the other the <hi>Clandeſtine:</hi> The one is a River conſiſting wholly of Caſcades, and hurrying every Moment with Violence, down Precipices; and the other a rapid Torrent, which being aſhamed of ſhowing itſelf, runs

            <p>As ſoon as one has ſet Foot within the Gates of this City, one hears nothing but the Cries and Complaints of Children, whom either an old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has ſacrificed to a young Rake, or whom an old Debauchee has given up as Victims to a young Coquet.

            <p>At the Gates of this City grows that famous Wood, mentioned by the bantering Doctor in the Play. The Trees, he ſays of this Wood, bear the Heads of all Sorts of Iron Tools, and the Earth underneath produces proper Handles wherewith to fit them up; but it often happens, that when the Iron is at full Growth, and falls, inſtead of meeting with a Handle that would be proper for it, it drops upon one that matches it moſt prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly: For Inſtance, the Head of a Scythe falls upon the Handle of a Pike, the Head of a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd upon the Helve of a Hatchet, and ſo of all

            <p>Upon the <hi>Southern Coaſt</hi> of this Iſland, is the Province of the <hi>Ill-at-Eaſe,</hi> whoſe Capital City is <hi>Short-Allowance,</hi> under the Command of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Hard-Fare.</hi> The Inhabitants of this Country are melancholly and fretful; the Houſes are but Cottages, which the Want of Belly-Timber un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhes by little and little; the Kitchens all lye

            <p>Notwithſtanding this miſerable Want of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Proviſion, moſt Part of the Inhabitants, and eſpecially the Women, will cheat their Bellies of the little they can afford, to beſtow it upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Dreſs, which conceals their inward Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities under a Diſguiſe of an eaſy Outſide: But this Deſire of Finery, beyond what they can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and the Cries of a half-ſtarved Belly, makes theſe Inhabitants leave this miſerable Country with Pleaſure, and flock in large Colonies, to People the Head Province, and endeavour to help the Barrenneſs of their Lands by the kindly Showers of Gold that fall from the Pockets of their Lovers.</p>

On the <hi>Northern Coaſt</hi> of the <hi>Iſle of Marriage</hi> lies the Province of the <hi>Jealous,</hi> whoſe Capital City is ſituated on the Middle of Mount <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera,</hi> juſt in that Part which the Antients ſaid was inhabited by <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> the Top being poſſeſſed by Lions, and the Bottom by Serpents; which gave Riſe to the Fable of its being an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal compoſed of three Natures. But the Poets, who were wretched Geographers, have miſtaken its Situation, ſince it is certainly in this Province that Mount <hi>Chimaera</hi> is ſituated.</p>
            <p>The Metropolis of the <hi>Jealous</hi> is call'd <hi>Falſe Belief;</hi> it is water'd by <hi>Anxiety,</hi> which is a River, whoſe deep yellow Stream, ſerves the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants as a deceitful and fallacious Looking-Glaſs, and fills their Heads with <hi>horned</hi> Viſions, by repreſenting Things to them in a quite different Manner from what they are in Reality.

and unpaſſable: It is wholly overſpread with ſteep Mountains, cover'd with impenetrable Woods, gloomy Vales, and barren Plains; wherefore none but the Native Inhabitants can dwell therein, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would the <hi>Jealous</hi> ſuffer them if they cou'd, and much leſs the <hi>Amathontins,</hi> than any others; becauſe they are firmly perſuaded, that they find ſome Means or other, to accompliſh their Deſigns every where.</p>
            <p>The Capital City, altho' ſituated on the Side of a Hill, ſtands nevertheleſs in a very obſcure Place, and is overſhadowed with Mountains on every Side.

               <p>Although the City be pretty Populous, one ſees very few Folks in the Streets, and the Huſbands beat the Tat-Too very early, to call their Wives

home in good Time, before the Duſk of the Evening expoſes them to any Surprize: They are an odd ſort of Mortals; they are perpetually upon Thorns, and one may ſee them hurry out, and return in again, every Minute, with the utmoſt Abruptneſs, their Eyes ſtaring all the while, and their Ears pricked up, with the utmoſt Attention and Anguiſh.</p>
               <p>They apply to themſelves every Word that is ſpoken; and tremble at the Sight of a Man of Gallantry, as much as a Dove at the Sight of a Hawk: Then it is that they are very diverting, by the Ridiculouſneſs and Folly of their Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which is ſo far from being of any Service to them, that they themſelves contribute moſt to the Succeſs of their Enemies Affairs, by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual teazing and provoking thoſe, whom they would defend from their Attacks: Since it is certain that nothing contributes more to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of a Gallant, than the Reaſons one gives a Wife to revenge herſelf of one's ill Uſage; and I have known thoſe whoſe Pleaſure has received a more exquiſite Reliſh, by the extravagant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Caprices of a jealous Cuckold.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Quarter which is called the Quarter of the <hi>Pazzi,</hi> is inhabited by thoſe Fools, who take a Pleaſure in publiſhing their own Shame, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Courts of Juſtice ring with their ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Complaints, and diverting the Publick with the continual Farce of their Extravagancies. All their Recreation is in bedaubing themſelves with Filth, and giving themſelves abundance of Trouble, and that at a vaſt Charge, in order to convince the Courts of Juſtice of their having ſuffered a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, which they ought rather, if poſſible, to endeavour to unknow themſelves, and with the Fruits of which the honeſt Lawyers feaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very merrily.</p>
               <p>Theſe extravagant Wretches are divided into two Claſſes, whereof the one have taken up their Quarters in the Hoſpital of the <hi>Curables;</hi> theſe are ſuch, as after a fruitleſs Clamour, which has rendered them for ſome Time the Talk and Jeſt of the Town, begin to recover their Senſes, and ſay, that all Things rightly conſidered, taking one Woman with another, they ſtill like their own Wives beſt.</p>
               <p>The others, who are lodged in a different, and yet leſs agreeable Quarter, are thoſe <hi>incurable Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1010300800:75"/>
who under the Direction of a <hi>hornified</hi> Phyſician, ride full Speed to lay their Bones in an Alms-Houſe, by making themſelves a Prey to a ſenſeleſs Obſtinacy, and being the continual Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Vultures and Harpies of the Law.</p>
               <p>The Deſolation of their Families, the Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Wives, the diſowning and baſtardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of their own Children, with an inexhauſtable Fund of Law-Suits entailed one upon another, are the neceſſary Conſequences of their Frenzy; and the Countenance they find as long as they have Money wherewith to feed the hungry Lawyers, is what contributes to their Infatuation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats their Ruin, to all Intents and Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>One may ſee them always in a Fury, with their Eyes ſwelled out of their Heads, and their Faces in a Flame, running from Attorney to Attorney, and from Council to Council, hunting for, and hiring, at a vaſt Expence, falſe Witneſſes, who cover all them with Ignominy, ſtopping their Ears againſt all the good Counſel that is given them, and ſhutting their Eyes againſt all the Examples of thoſe who have recovered their Senſes. But of all theſe mad Wretches, none ſure was ever more diſtracted, than he over whoſe Door they paſted up the following Verſes.</p>

            <p>On the other Side of the <hi>Pactolus</hi> are the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Cuckolds,</hi> who believe themſelves to be what they are not, and the <hi>Incredulous Cuckolds,</hi> who are not to be covinced that they are what they really are: Theſe are two Sorts of Citizens, of very different Tempers; the firſt reſolving to be Inhabitants of this City in Spight of all that could be done to prevent them; and the others being to the laſt Degree aſtoniſhed at their being made free thereof, without having any Title to it, as they are pleaſed to flatter themſelves. The Houſes of theſe Two Sorts of Citizens, whoſe Tempers are ſo very different, are ſeparated from each other, by a Rivulet called the <hi>Perverſe,</hi> whoſe Waters are ſo muddy and ſo thick, that the Eye cannot diſcover what lies at the Bottom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1010300800:77"/>
The <hi>Incredulous</hi> are only ſo, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe too intire, and too implicit a Confidence in whatever their artful Wives endeavour to make them believe; they live contented, and at Quiet, but not like thoſe <hi>contented Ones</hi> in that Quarter called the <hi>Land of Plenty,</hi> who both know of, give Conſent to, and pocket up their <hi>Horns,</hi> in order to reap their own Benefit from it, but by the Means of an indolent Ignorance, that keeps them from all Uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Day laſts, their whole Employment is to enjoy a ſweet and peaceable Repoſe in the Foreſt of <hi>Confidence,</hi> a Place that is impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by the Rays of the Sun, and not within the reach of the Noiſe of the City. The one might in vain beat all their Drums, and ſound all their Trumpets, yet would it never in the leaſt diſturb their Ears; and the other might ſhine out with the greateſt Luſtre, and diffuſe all his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rays around the Globe to as little Purpoſe, ſince it would not have the leaſt Effect upon their Eyes. Happy they in their peaceful Indolence! But more happy ſtill the artful Gipſies, who have brought them to ſuch a Paſs!</p>
            <p>There is nothing to be ſeen in this Quarter, but mutual Pleaſure and Endearments between the Huſbands and Wives; the one, with an entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, think they can neither find Words obliging

enough, or Careſſes tender enough to thank their Dears for a Fidelity, which they are far from keeping; and the ſubtle Baggages, the more they deceive them, the more they redouble their Wheedling, their Careſſes, and all Manner of fond and enſnaring Endearments.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, that Quarter which is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the <hi>Imaginary Cuckolds,</hi> differs widely from this in every Particular; the People there are moroſe, quarrelfome, and unſociable; one may obſerve them always upon their Guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every Body, and both Sexes are equally ſubject to this Virtigo. Nothing there is to be heard, but Quarrels and Reproaches; the one are perpetually troubled with the <hi>Spleen,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with the <hi>Vapours;</hi> their very Children fall Sacrifices to this reciprocal Caprice; even the moſt legitimate are looked upon as Baſtard Grafts; every Thing there is miſconſtrued, and they judge of nothing without Prejudice. One cannot ſo much as ſet a Foot in the Streets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding a prodigious Number falling together by the Ears, and the honeſt Man in the Play,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Mock Doctor.</note> who interpoſed impertinently between the <hi>Faggot-Maker</hi> and his Wife, in order to bring them to a Reconciliation, would have found full Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

there, in meddling between the Bark and the Tree.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, theſe People are abſolutely Incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; for, although the Goddeſs of Reaſon once ſent the famous <hi>Moliere</hi> to them, from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Witalls</hi> of the <hi>Land of Plenty,</hi> in order to convince them of their Infatuation, by drawing an admirable Picture of the Extravagance of their Imaginations, he could never ſucceed in the Cure he had undertaken, and their Brains remained as much addled as ever; wherefore ſome Time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were complimented with the following Verſes.</p>

As <hi>Hornborough,</hi> although it is of a vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, is far from being large enough to contain that prodigious Number of Inhabitants, who have actually an inconteſtable Right to a Freedom there, the Country round about ſwarms with the meaner Sort, who leave the City for Courtiers, Commiſſioners of the Treaſury and Cuſtoms, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Eſtates, great Merchants, ſubſtantial Tradeſmen, and ſome Officers of the Army; but above all for an infinite Number of <hi>Gown-Men,</hi> whoſe Profeſſion marks them out for a <hi>Head-Piece</hi> of <hi>Horn-Work,</hi> which they very ſeldom fail to wear.</p>
            <p>Having thus given an Account of the whole Body of the Iſland, there remains now only two little Diſtricts to be deſcribed, which are two Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninſula's that run out into the Sea; the one, which is on a Neck of Land towards the <hi>North,</hi> is the Promontory of <hi>Divorce,</hi> and the other, which is on another towards the <hi>South,</hi> is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of <hi>Widowhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Peninſula of <hi>Divorce,</hi> is only ſeparated from the Iſle of <hi>Marriage,</hi> by a very narrow <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> through which it is pretty difficult to paſs. It is called the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Corinth;</hi> and from thence came the Proverb, that every Body is not allowed to go to <hi>Corinth;</hi> that is to ſay, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1010300800:81"/>
every Body is not allowed a Paſſage into the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninſula</hi> of <hi>Divorce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Extravagance of an old Chancellour of a Dioceſs, who was deſirous of rendering this Paſſage more eaſy, induced him formerly to conſtitute an imprudent, filthy, and brutal Giant, called my Lord <hi>Congreſs,</hi> Superintendant of this <hi>Iſthmus.</hi> This was a <hi>Curious</hi> and <hi>Shameleſs Wretch,</hi> who in order to remove the Difficulties of this Paſſage, rendered <hi>Impotent,</hi> (by obliging them to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in Publick,) the <hi>Conjugal Efforts</hi> of thoſe Huſbands, who would have hindered their Wives from removing into this <hi>Peninſula.</hi> The Modeſty of the Moderns, wou'd no longer ſuffer this filthy Lord to expoſe the Combatants to this Shame and Infamy, wherefore they have caſhier'd this ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Superintendant; but in Return, the artful <hi>Amathontins</hi> have brought into Play another En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantreſs, who has been introduced under the Name of <hi>Separation,</hi> and they have ſupported her ſo well, that ſhe makes few Attempts without Succeſs.</p>
            <p>It is ſhe who now peoples the <hi>Peninſula</hi> of <hi>Divorce,</hi> becauſe the River <hi>Repudiate,</hi> whereby they formerly arrived thither, is no longer navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable; thus by removing a ſmall Evil which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a great Good, they have introduced a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1010300800:82"/>
ſmall Good, which does not prevent a great Evil.</p>
            <p>This little Country has neither Towns nor Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages; all the Houſes are ſeparated from each other like Hermitages; and to take a View of it from the neighbouring Eminencies, one wou'd fancy it actually the Abode of ſome Anchorets. But the Solitude and Melancholy of theſe Deſarts, is mightily alleviated, by the frequent Intercourſe of the <hi>Amathontins,</hi> who take abundance of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therein, and find the Means to adminiſter agreeable Conſolation to the ſolitary Inhabitants. Above all, this is the Place where the Gentlemen of the long Robe gain the moſt Triumphs; for as the Fair Sex cannot get over the Difficulties that obſtruct this Paſſage, without the Aſſiſtance of thoſe who wear that Robe, their firſt Care is always to provide themſelves of a Protector, who may remove all Obſtacles.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of this Country are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by thoſe in the Iſle of <hi>Marriage;</hi> but when the latter take upon them to blame their Conduct, they have an Anſwer ready, which is as follows.</p>

            <p>The other <hi>Peninſula</hi> is that of <hi>Widowhood,</hi> which is upon a Promontory that lies towards the <hi>South,</hi> and is only ſeparated from the reſt of the Iſland, by a very narrow Neck of Land, which is wholly taken up by a magnificent <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> built after the Model of that of Queen <hi>Artemiſa;</hi> inſomuch that there is no paſſing for any one from the Iſle of <hi>Marriage,</hi> to the Diſtrict of <hi>Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> but through this Tomb, by the Means of a ſubterraneous Vault, that is contrived under it.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants always make their Entrance there in Mourning, and they live there in Joy and Pleaſure; the Air of this Country, which every one there breaths with Freedom, being the moſt conſolatory in the World. Nevertheleſs, all the Inhabitants are not able to reliſh it with Pleaſure, and Satisfaction; for there comes a Wind, from the Coaſt of a certain little Province of the Iſland, called <hi>Binubia,</hi> whoſe malignant Atoms

cauſe <hi>new Itchings,</hi> which create ſuch Uneaſineſs, as thoſe that are troubled therewith, believe they can have no Cure for, without going to <hi>Binubia,</hi> and breathing the Air of that Place.</p>
            <p>One cannot re-enter the Iſland of <hi>Marriage,</hi> but by this Coaſt, which makes a little ſeparate Province, and has even ſome particular Laws, which are not obſerved in the other Provinces.</p>
            <p>In order to ſet ſail for this little Country of <hi>Binubia,</hi> the Inhabitants of the Peninſula of <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood,</hi> muſt embark at a certain little Port, which has taken its Name from the celebrated <hi>Epheſian</hi> Matron, becauſe it was there ſhe took ſhipping with her Soldier, in order to ſet ſail for <hi>Binubia.</hi> Nevertheleſs ſeveral Perſons have given it the Name of <hi>Evil Counſel,</hi> although the Marble, that is at the Foot of an old Statue which is placed there, gives very <hi>good Counſel</hi> in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſes, which are to be ſeen thereon.</p>

            <p>'Tis impoſſible to imagine with what violent Fits of Laughter, what cutting Raillery, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Widowhood</hi> banter thoſe who ſet out for <hi>Binubia;</hi> they hire an infinite Number of Hawkers, who are perpetually hollowing in their Ears, <hi>A Warning to all old Widows, who marry ſecond Huſbands. The lamentable Hiſtory and Downfall of the old Widower, who married his Cook-maid; come a Halfpenny a Piece, a Halfpenny a Piece,</hi> and a Thouſand other ſuch biting Jeſts, in Deriſion to thoſe, who have not the Reſolution to keep themſelves in that happy State, which perhaps they have ardently wiſh'd for a hundred Times, before the happy Minute of their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance came.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1010300800:87"/>
But the People of <hi>Binubia,</hi> who have often been themſelves the firſt, to rally thoſe whom they have afterwards follow'd, give, once for all, the following Anſwer to thoſe who ſtay behind.</p>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>And perhaps they are not very much in the Wrong, when they anſwer them in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for it frequently happens that we fall into that very ſame Error, for which we have been the firſt to reprehend others; and moſt Part of the Inhabitants of <hi>Binubia,</hi> did not engage in ſecond Marriages, till after they had often endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſſuade others from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Binubia,</hi> is a little City, whoſe Buildings are for the moſt Part old, and almoſt ready to fall; only the Walls are new white-waſh'd, new plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd up, and new painted according to Art, to hide all Defects. Every Thing there has a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and mournful Aſpect: and as almoſt every Match there has been made by the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Self-Intereſt, all there are intent upon managing their Affairs to their own private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1010300800:88"/>
at the Expence of their Partner, whom they flatter themſelves with the Hopes of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving. Accordingly the very beſt Employment of any in this Country, is to follow the Law, in order to take Advantage of the innumerable Law-Suits which are daily cauſed by ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
            <p>Nothing is to be heard there, but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and mournful Lamentations, of Children by a firſt Marriage, who have been robb'd, and cheated of their Right, to inrich thoſe by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; with endleſs Enquiries into Titles to Eſtates, to which the Lawyers at laſt become the Principal Heirs; and Diſputes about Guardians Accounts, and falſe Inventories: In ſhort, every Thing there is in Trouble and Confuſion, and the Pettyfoggers have not in the World ſuch another fruitful Nurſery of Law-Suits.</p>
            <p>Having now given you an Account of all the different People that inhabit the Iſland of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;</hi> viz. the <hi>Diſcreet,</hi> the <hi>Ill-match'd,</hi> the <hi>Ill-at-Eaſe,</hi> the <hi>Jealous,</hi> the <hi>Cuckolds,</hi> the <hi>Binu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> the <hi>Divorced,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood;</hi> nothing remains but to give likewiſe ſome Deſcription of their Enemies, the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thontins,</hi> and the perpetual Wars they have with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1010300800:89"/>
I have already obſerved that <hi>Amathontis,</hi> or the Iſland of <hi>Lovers,</hi> is not far diſtant from the Iſle of <hi>Marriage;</hi> and indeed it is ſo near, that the <hi>Amathontins</hi> are every Moment invading them in prodigious Numbers, and never fail making terrible Havock amongſt them; inſomuch that they are very ſeldom driven out again, when they have once got Footing there. One Province or other is always warmly engaged with them, eſpecially <hi>Cuckoldſhire,</hi> which is over-run with their Multitudes, and the others are not free from them.</p>
            <p>Their Manner of waging War is very pleaſant, for it is not in Incurſions, that make a great Noiſe and Buſtle in the World, that they place their chief Hope, and Dependence; no, they do their Buſineſs much better, by introducing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without Clamour, by getting Footing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and by gaining over to their Intereſt all the moſt conſiderable Perſons in the Country: But they have no ſooner made a Lodgment any where, but they know how to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein, and the fewer they march in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the more formidable they are.</p>
            <p>It is not then with open Force, that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Enemy whom they deſign to <hi>overthrow;</hi> one hears neither Trumpet ſound, nor Drum beat, when they march either to <hi>ſtorm</hi> a <hi>Fort,</hi> or to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1010300800:90"/>
               <hi>give Battle;</hi> all is done without Noiſe; <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> are all made either by Intrenchment, or by Sap, and their <hi>Battles</hi> are all reduced to <hi>ſingle Combat,</hi> every Man <hi>ſingling out the Enemy,</hi> with whom he chooſes to encounter.</p>
            <p>As for their Weapons, <hi>Volleys of Sighs</hi> are their only <hi>Small-Arms; Languiſhing</hi> and <hi>dying Eyes,</hi> their only <hi>Swords;</hi> and the <hi>ſofteſt</hi> and <hi>moſt tender Expreſſions,</hi> their <hi>moſt dangerous Artillery:</hi> They have indeed a Kind of <hi>Short Stilletto</hi> which they <hi>always</hi> carry <hi>about them conceal'd,</hi> and with which they ſometimes give <hi>dangerous Stabs;</hi> but this is never but when they are <hi>very cloſe,</hi> and <hi>very warmly engaged,</hi> and have the <hi>Enemy down and at a Diſadvantage,</hi> for which Reaſon ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will ſcarcely allow it to be a <hi>fair Weapon;</hi> but, be that as it will, it is well known, that <hi>few</hi> of the <hi>Enemy</hi> are <hi>afraid</hi> of its <hi>moſt home Thruſts.</hi> Their <hi>greateſt Valour</hi> then conſiſts only in their <hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Complaiſance</hi> to their Enemies; their <hi>Glory</hi> is wholly confin'd to <hi>loading</hi> them with their <hi>own Spoils;</hi> and their moſt <hi>compleat Victory</hi> is in <hi>expiring</hi> between the <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>conquer'd Enemy;</hi> in ſhort, the <hi>more ſecret</hi> their <hi>Triumphs</hi> are, the <hi>greater. Pleaſure</hi> they <hi>take</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>By this Conduct, and provided the <hi>Sinews of War</hi> are <hi>not wanting,</hi> there is nothing which an
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1010300800:91"/>
               <hi>Amathontin</hi> cannot effect: <hi>No Fortifications</hi> are <hi>Proof</hi> againſt their <hi>Cannon,</hi> nor is there any <hi>Fort</hi> which will not <hi>ſurrender,</hi> if they <hi>perſevere</hi> in their <hi>Attacks.</hi> This made them once put the following Inſcription upon a <hi>Quiver,</hi> which they dedicated to the <hi>God of Love.</hi>

            <p>Neither do they often fail of being as good as their Words.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1010300800:92"/>
thoſe who have connived at their getting any Footing in the Country.</p>
            <p>But whoever would attempt to deſcribe all the Wiles, and all the Stratagems, whereof this artful Nation makes uſe of, in order to introduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, make a Lodgment, and gain a compleat Victory, would be obliged to write Millions of Volumes. Not but that there are among them an infinite Number of <hi>Inconſtants, Indiſcreet Ones,</hi> and <hi>Impoſtors;</hi> one may hear Complaints made of them every Day. But, notwithſtanding all theſe Complaints, there would be no living with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and half their Enemies would be in a very ſad Condition, if they ſhould ceaſe to make War upon them.</p>
            <p>'Tis impoſſible to conceive into what a good Humour the Reading of this agreeable Piece put the whole Company, by its humerous Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iſle of <hi>Marriage.</hi> All owned it to be exquiſitely imagined, and to be carried on with the niceſt Judgment; at laſt it brought into our Minds the celebrated <hi>Map</hi> of <hi>Tender</hi> in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of <hi>Clelia,</hi> which formerly was highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd, but every one agreed that this had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Beauties, and a Delicacy, and Turn, which the other was far from coming up to.</p>
            <p>Every one then called to Remembrance thoſe Places which had made the moſt lively Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1010300800:93"/>
upon their Imagination; but of all the Parts of the Iſland, they always returned again to <hi>Hornborough,</hi> through a certain natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſeems to draw all the World thither; either to make Part of its Inhabitants, or to laugh at them, and very often for both. For the Citizens of this vaſt City have this merry Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty belonging to them, that they generally ridicule one another; ſome to divert Peoples Thoughts from being fixed upon them, and others to comfort themſelves for their own Diſgrace.</p>
            <p>At laſt, <hi>Melinda,</hi> one of the three Ladies who were with us, and who has a delicate and juſt Way of thinking and expreſſing herſelf, turned about to me, and aſked me, If I could give any Reaſon, why People were fond of having it thought, that the <hi>Horned Society</hi> are the Chief, and moſt numerous Part of the Inhabitanes of this vaſt Country.</p>
            <p>You aſk me a Queſtion, Madam, ſaid I, to which it is not very difficult to find an Anſwer; for as ſoon as you reflect, that this formidable Society conſiſts for the moſt Part of Men who are <hi>haughty, unſociable, moroſe, ſnappiſh, ill-natured, uncomplaiſant, uneaſy</hi> in their Circumſtances, and perpetually employed about every Thing that is the <hi>moſt unlikely</hi> to render a Man <hi>gallant</hi> and

               <hi>agreeable,</hi> you will find more Reaſons than one, for what you deſire to know.</p>
            <p>Theſe few Words opened us a large Field of Scandal, and gave us full Scope to take a general Review of ſome Hundreds of our Acquaintance, which we accordingly did afterwards, Time not then permitting by Reaſon Dinner was ready: Wherefore we adjourned our Satire 'till After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, at the joint Invitation of <hi>Ceres, Bacchus,</hi> and our own Appetites, which were by this Time pretty ſharp ſet. What paſſed afterwards may poſſibly prove the Entertainment of another Day, if this meets with a favourable Acceptance from the Town.</p>

The Furniture of my Houſe, and Table-Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, cannot come ſhort of 300 l. which, with 50 l. for Plate (without which, being ſo moderate a Quantity, I dare) ſay my Wife, nor indeed ſhould I myſelf be ſatisfied) will lie dead, daily decreaſe in its Value, and bring me in no Income; I muſt therefore reckon my Wife's Fortune (in point of its bringing me in a Yearly Income) at no more than 1650 l.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as you have been a Houſe-Keeper, and married theſe ſeveral Years, pray tell me, If in any one Article, I have charged too much? Whether if I have not rather under-charged them, and omitted ſeveral, that I, being unacquainted with theſe Sort of Things, can have no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of?</p>
               <p>If therefore it is a moderate Computation, and neceſſary, ſuppoſing Intereſt to continue at five <hi>per Cent.</hi> (which is unlikely) the Produce of 1650 l. is only 82 l. 10 s. and if it ſhould fall to four <hi>per Cent.</hi> is only 66 l. In the one Caſe, I muſt neceſſarily expend on my Wife 221 l. in the other 237 l. 10 s. above the Income of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhe brings, beſides the Hazard and Want of Security for the Money, which ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1010300800:105"/>
and though it be neceſſary, yet how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it is, I ſubmit to you.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things conſidered (and he that marries without previous Conſideration acts very indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly) I do not ſee how I can marry a Woman with the Fortune you propoſe, or that I ſhould better my ſelf at all by it, and in Prudence, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould do ſo, or let it alone; (not that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or think to have more) I muſt therefore live ſingle, tho' with ſome Regret that I cannot do otherwiſe, and increaſe my own Fortune, which happens to be ſufficient for my own Maintenance till, (if I may ſo call it) I can afford Matrimony.</p>
               <p>I wiſh the Lady all Happineſs and a better Huſband, and if it be for her Satisfaction, one who has thought leſs of the Matter; not but that I have a very good Opinion of Matrimony, and think of it with Pleaſure, as hoping one Time or other to enter into its Liſt, but I now wait with Patience, till my Circumſtances or Thoughts vary.</p>
               <p>One Thing I would not have you miſtaken in, is, that I do not mean that your Relation will be thus expenſive to me, more than any other, only that whenever I marry, let her be who ſhe will, I muſt neceſſarily (if ſhe has no more Fortune
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1010300800:106"/>
than you propoſe) expend conſiderably more than 200 l. a Year on her, above the Income of her Fortune, and at preſent I cannot perſuade my ſelf to be at ſo great an Expence, for the Sake of trying a dangerous Experiment, whether the Pleaſures of Matrimony are Yearly worth that Sum: All which is ſubmitted to your Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOUR Eſtimate has been read over and conſidered in our Family, and now lies upon the Table to be peruſed by the Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Several Objections have been made to it, I ſhall take Notice of ſome of them. It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That you do not deal with that Candour and Ingenuity in ſtating the Account that you ought to do; for in the Way you compute, you make
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1010300800:109"/>
no Allowance for the Reputation and Advantage which you will in many Reſpects gain, and which will accrue to your ſelf by a Houſe kept in the Manner you mention; the Credit of which, in a great Meaſure, centers in you, while the Care of it lies wholly upon your Wife. So that in 128 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> conſiſting of fourteen Articles, from the Butcher's Bill, down to Brick-Duſt, Rotten-Stone, Whiteing, and other little Ingredients, you will be found not only to be the greateſt Cauſe of the Expence, but will have the principal Share in the Pleaſure, and in the Eſteem obtained by it; tho' it is true, <hi>Fullers-Rents</hi> and <hi>Sheer-Lane</hi> loſe 1 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> a Day by your Dinners. The ſame Error runs through ſome other Articles; for my Relation will not, I believe, eaſily comprehend why ſhe ſhould be ſolely loaded with the Charge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending 45 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> upon Children, which you ſeem very well diſpoſed to get. Beſides, let me tell you, <hi>Jack,</hi> you ought to bring into the Account the Saving which will ariſe from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Proceeding in that Affair, which, upon the Change of your Condition, you muſt make to come wonderfully cheap to you; a Grandee of <hi>Spain</hi> reproached the Lady whom he had married with a ſmall Fortune, that he believed that every Pleaſure he had had with her, had coſt him a <hi>Dobloon</hi> a Time; ſhe replied, that was none of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1010300800:110"/>
her Fault, for his Excellency might have reduced it to ſix <hi>Denieres</hi> a Time if he had pleaſed, in the two Years they had lain together. I doubt you ſink an Article of your Expence here; you know, <hi>Jack,</hi> your beloved <hi>Horace</hi> ſays, there are Things, <hi>quibus doleat Natura negatis,</hi> and does not loveleſs, joyleſs, unindeared, caſual Fruition coſt you Money? You tell us of the Doctor and the Apothecary when you are married; 'tis well for you, if you ſteer clear of the Surgeon before you enter into that State. Nothing but urgent Neceſſity can draw Money from you; he that deals in cheap Pictures, and cheap Women, is a Loſer at laſt.</p>
               <p>In your concluding Remark, you ſeem unjuſtly to diminiſh my Kinſwoman's Fortune; for is not the 300 <hi>l.</hi> Furniture of your Houſe and Table-Linen, with the 50 <hi>l.</hi> for Plate, your own as much as if it were in Caſh? And does not every Circumſtance in a married Life recommend you to the World, equal to the Money it coſts you, if laid out prudently? You have a Settlement by it, that makes you a better Subject, a more uſeful Friend, and a more virtuous Man.</p>
               <p>How many are they who by Degrees hardening themſelves againſt the Sex eſtabliſhed by the Laws of Nature, and of the Land, at laſt fall into a horrible and odious Sin of Non-Conformity, never
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1010300800:111"/>
tolerated in any Chriſtian Country? This ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times draws an Expence after it in a Compoſition far exceeding the 43 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> the proper and ſole Charge of the Pleaſures of Matrimony by your own Calculation, which you cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade your ſelf to undergo, as not thinking them yearly worth that Sum.</p>
               <p>Conſider <hi>Jack,</hi> who are your truly idle Fellows in Town and Country, that ſaunter away their Time at Coffee-Houſes and at Gaming-Tables: They are all or moſt of them of your Family, Mr <hi>Single.</hi> The young Fellows who are always ſtudying how to ſpend Time, to paſs away Time, to wear away Time, to kill Time, they are all of your Family: the Reaſon is plain, they have nothing in the World for which it is worth while to improve Time. Beſides, Idleneſs teacheth all Kind of Evil, and while you by your parſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Celibacy deny your ſelf the proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, you cheriſh the Diſeaſe, and at the ſame Time you endeavour to check the River in its natural Channel, you make it overflow the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Meadows.</p>
               <p>What Topicks are uſed to incite a Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Liberty of his Country? 'Tis for the Sake of his Family and Poſterity, for the Sake of his Wife and Children; the Argument will have little Force, if urged for the Sake of <hi>Jack Single,</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1010300800:112"/>
at his Chambers two Pair of Stairs high in <hi>Grey's-Inn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Argument did the <hi>Gaſcon</hi> uſe to reſtrain a Man from a raſh (as he thought it,) Action? Fighting with him; won't you conſider, crys the <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> (when their Swords were drawn,) your Wife? No, ſays the Man. Won't you conſider, crys he, your Wife and Children? No, No, ſays the other, then I will, reply'd the <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> and gravely put up his Sword.</p>

               <p>AS I am the real Author of the <hi>Batchelor's Eſtimate,</hi> which has for ſome Time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded Diverſion to, and undergone the Criticiſms of the Town; I think in Juſtice to it, I ſhould vindicate it from the Aſperſions thrown on it and the Author, eſpecially from thoſe in Print, that I think worth conſidering. As to two of them the LADY's ANSWER, and the WO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN's ADVOCATE, I ſhall take no farther No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, than that they have the Names of Anſwers, only to make the Copies of the <hi>Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> which they annexed to them, and pirated from the true Proprietor, to ſell the better. As to the firſt, the Town at its firſt coming out was ſufficiently ſatisfied 'twas a <hi>Grub-ſtreet;</hi> as to the ſecond, I think it beneath a Gentleman to anſwer
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1010300800:116"/>
it, becauſe no Gentleman could have wrote it, conſiſting of ſo much Scurrility: It's ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to me to obſerve, that the Readers of it, from its being ſo prepoſterous and ſcurrilous, immediately cry out of the Author, <hi>This Fellow is a Fool.</hi> As to the Married Man's Anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis wrote like a Gentleman, and with no ſuch ſordid View as the others were, I chuſe for thoſe Reaſons to anſwer it, and ſhall therefore in ſo doing addreſs myſelf to the Author thereof.</p>
               <p>The firſt Thing, Sir, you begin with by way of Anſwer, is, That I make no Allowance for the Reputation and Advantage, which you ſay I ſhall in many Reſpects gain by Houſe-keeping. Could you have mentioned any one of thoſe many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, I don't doubt but that you would; but ſuch a general Charge, without any Reaſon or Foundation mention'd to ſupport it, ſeems to me to argue, as if you could not maintain your Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and indeed I can't conceive how you can. Does paying Pariſh-Taxes clear our Intellects, or does Matrimony refine our Judgements? If not, how comes it about, and on what Foundation can the <hi>married Man</hi> and Houſe-keeper have a greater Reputation than the <hi>Batchelor?</hi> I muſt own I don't know: But now I think on't indeed, in one reſpect he may; that is, by marrying an agreeable Woman he ſtands a very fair Chance of having a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1010300800:117"/>
Reputation, now very much in vogue, in that State; which, I thank my Stars, I, as a <hi>Batchelor,</hi> am only capacitated to give, but not to receive. Was I to employ a Perſon to manage my Affairs, I ſhould chuſe to employ the <hi>Batchelor,</hi> in regard the <hi>married Man</hi> has ſo much to do to mind his Family-Affairs, he'll have but little Time to mind thoſe of others.</p>
               <p>As to the Deductions you would have made on the Account of caſual Fruition, and the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Articles of it; before you make ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, you ſhould firſt lay it down as neceſſary, that young Fellows muſt <hi>Whore</hi> or <hi>Marry,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 'tis ungenerous to tax me, as I have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the one, that I muſt the other. If you make it out, that a Batchelor muſt go a <hi>whoring,</hi> you have found out ſomething new, and as the firſt Diſcoveries of any Thing <hi>uſeful</hi> ought to have Thanks, you have mine. If there's no ſuch Neceſſity, for ought you know I may be one of thoſe <hi>Batchelors,</hi> that walking between two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices <hi>(Whoredom</hi> and <hi>Matrimony)</hi> may have ſo cautiouſly directed my Steps, as to avoid both. But as 'tis not for my <hi>Credit</hi> with the Fair Sex to pretend not to have been gratified by any of them, I own I have had ſome Amours, but not with ſuch as were ſordidly proſtituting their Charms for Gain; but with thoſe only, who gratified
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1010300800:118"/>
me for no other Proſpect, than an equal Return of Love, conſequently no Deduction ought to be made on the Account of the Expence of it. But ſuppoſing that my Taſte has been ſo very low, as to take up with thoſe, that lett their Charms to hire, and that I have been at ſome Expence in that Reſpect; yet as Women are now-a-days very cheap (pardon me, I mean thoſe of the Town) and their Price runs at a low Ebb; 30 <hi>l.</hi> a Year will drive a pretty good Trade with that Sort of Ware; and I am told you may agree by the Great, and for Five Guineas a Year inſure your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt any ill Conſequences that may happen. And if the Expence of caſual Fruition is no more (as prudent Dealers therein aſſure me it is not) I am ſure the Undervaluations and Omiſſions in my Eſtimate amount to above twice thoſe Sums.</p>
               <p>You alledge (and for Argument-ſake ſuppoſe it true) that in the Articles of Houſe-keeping I ſhall have the principal Pleaſure, yet I muſt be at ſix Parts in ſeven of the Expence. Pray how ſtands it then? Is that Encouragement to commence Huſband?</p>
               <p>'Tis not my Wife, but I, ſhall bear the Load of the Expence of Children, for you ſee her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune can ſcarcely anſwer any Expence at all; but as ſhe partakes of an equal, if not, as moſt allow, a greater Pleaſure in the begetting them, I don't
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1010300800:119"/>
ſee why ſhe ſhould not proportionably contribute to their Maintenance.</p>
               <p>By the Story of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Grandee, you would inſinuate (and conſiſtent enough with your Admiſſion of my being well diſpos'd to get Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) that let it coſt me what it will, I may by a frequent Repetition of the Pleaſures of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, (and I dare ſay, not diſagreeable to my Wife) reduce the Expence of each Pleaſure to a very minute Sum, unleſs it was my own Fault, which admits a Readineſs of one Side. But on a ſecond Calculation of the Expences of the Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, I find I ſhall pay for thoſe Pleaſures at the Rate of 12 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> for each Night's Lodging; a meer Trifle, you'll ſay: But however, whether after Honey-Moon is over, (which, by the Way, they tell me is the ſhorteſt in the Year) thoſe Pleaſures will be ſo frequent, as to reduce the Expence of them to a very minute Sum; or on the other Side, whether ſeveral 12 <hi>s.</hi> 8 Pences will not be expended towards each Pleaſure, is the hazardous Experiment I ſtill decline to make; but leave it to thoſe who have ſhot the <hi>Gulf,</hi> and now know the Danger, to reflect how prudent they were, when they undertook ſo hardy an Enterprize: where, let the dear Partner be ſullen and ill temper'd, or gay and good-natur'd; let her by Chance or otherwiſe be ugly or agreeable;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1010300800:120"/>
let her be obſtreperous and unruly, and, <hi>Xantippe</hi> like, ſcold me out of Houſe and Home, or be meek and condeſcending; let her be expenſive (and what ſome good Wives have induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done) run me into Goal, or the frugal and careful; let her be healthy or ailing; let her be a <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> or a <hi>Lucrece;</hi> let her have all the ill, and none of the good Qualities; yet this <hi>dear Creature</hi> I am deſtin'd to love and cheriſh for Life, ſhe muſt be Partaker of my Bed and Board. From this Bargain, tho' ne'er ſo ill concerted, there's no Appeal lies, or any Redreſs to be had. Who then that lives already comfortably and happy, would, (not knowing when he was well) be Fool enough to make an Experiment; where, if it happens according to his Wiſhes, he can but live ſtill comfortable and happy; and where, if it does not (as I believe moſt People will allow it to be a reaſonable Chance to lay twenty to one againſt him) he'll have only this ſad Reflection; I was happy, but ſtrove to be otherwiſe, and am ſo. Such an Experiment would be as prudent, as that made by a Perſon, who having a very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Diamond, would needs try, whether it was ſo hard as to bear the Strokes of a Hammer on an Anvil. He ſatisfied his Curioſity; what follow'd? The Diamond broke, and the Poſſeſſor of it curſt his Stars, for having been ſuch a Fool.</p>

You ſay by Marriage I became a better Subject, a more uſeful Friend, and a more virtuous Man, neither of which can I allow. As to the firſt then; There is no Law that commands or forbids us to marry; He that does not, tranſgreſſes no Law; and he that does, complies with none. How can one then be a better Member of a Community, or a better Subject than the other, when what is ſaid to make a Difference between them, is in itſelf indifferent. But as every Body, thank Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is left to his own Choice; and mine, I think, is the beſt, being conſiſtent with the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of an inſpired Writer; I pronounce myſelf a better Subject, who can without Injuſtice to any, freely engage in the Service of my King and Country; and as <hi>Pomfret</hi> ſays, afford them <hi>my Tongue, my Pen, my Fortune and my Sword;</hi> than he, that is obliged to make uſe of all theſe, to miniſter to the Neceſſities of a Family, which he is ty'd to; and which, conſiſtent with the Laws of God and Man, 'tis his utmoſt Duty to provide for.</p>
               <p>To be a more uſeful Friend, it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a married Man; for he muſt (and it is a great Sin if he omits it) breed up, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and provide for his Family: if, during that Time, he ſhould provide for a Relation, do a Friend a Kindneſs, or this, or that Act of Charity, it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1010300800:122"/>
will be looked upon to be, and ſo it is in Fact, ſo far a Robbery of his own Family; ſo that the Tyes of his Duty in that Reſpect are ſo ſtrong, he can ſcarce do one Act of Benevolence to any other: ſo true is the old Proverb, <hi>Charity begins at Home.</hi> And even when he has done all he can, his thankleſs Children (which, by the way, is no great Encouragement to beget them) think he made a very ill Uſe of his Time, in not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed them greater Fortunes: Whereas the <hi>Batchelor</hi> having none but himſelf to provide for, and having the ſame Methods and Talents of becoming rich, with <hi>the married Man,</hi> without a Quarter of the Expence, ſoon gains that End; while it is well, if the married Man, with his greateſt Induſtry, ſupports his Family. <hi>The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor</hi> gives his Niece, or Couſin a Fortune, and places her in the World; binds a Nephew Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, puts out a poor Child to School, relieves a poor iuduſtrious Family ſtruggling with Poverty, lends or gives a Friend a Sum on an Emergency; ALL theſe he does, not as a Performance of any Duty incumbent on him, nor will it be eſteemed as ſuch, but as meer Acts of Benevolence; he robs none, he does none Injuſtice, his Family at home want it not; he is valued and reſpected as a truly generous Soul, he ſees the good Things he does, rewarded in the Gratitude of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1010300800:123"/>
of his Benevolence; and in the Increaſe of his Fortune, which, with his good Intentions, gives him Ability; whilſt the <hi>married Man,</hi> tho' perhaps he may have the Inclination, yet very ſeldom has the Ability of being half ſo uſeful a Friend as the Batchelor.</p>
               <p>As to the married Man's being more virtuous than a Batchelor, I am ſatisfied there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Provocations to Paſſion in Family-Concerns, that the married Man lies under a frequenter Temptation to Sin in that reſpect: And beſides, the neceſſary Parſimony a Huſband muſt be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of, to ſupport his Family, often betrays him into a ſtrange Narrowneſs of Temper and Avarice. And every Body knows, that there are Sins, and great ones too, incident only to a married State, which, it is well, if they are avoided: Thoſe of <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> even were our Boſom Friends our Wives Judges, I dare ſay, are not few.</p>
               <p>As to the odious Sin of Nonconformity, I think it is ungenerous in the higheſt Degree to ſuggeſt any Thing without due Grounds for it; but let it ſtick on the Guilty: As for my Part, I aſſure you, I love the Fair Sex ſo well, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly oblige them in any Thing in the World, but <hi>marry</hi> them.</p>
               <p>As to ſauntering at Coffee-Houſes, and Loſs at Play, I would have you know I have Buſineſs
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1010300800:124"/>
to employ me, ſo as not to be idle; and even not to have Time ſo much almoſt as to think of Matrimony, (for I think none but Idlers do think on it;) and as to Play, I am ſo far averſe to any Thing that is attended with Hazard and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, that I decline Matrimony on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, being with reſpect to the Hazard of it, a Species of Gaming.</p>
               <p>The Ladies are much obliged to you for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Advocate; all the Men of Honour will ſurely be married immediately, there will ſcarce be a Girl left; for by the <hi>Gaſcoon</hi> Story, you have plainly ſhewn, that thoſe that marry, and have Families, muſt of neceſſity be Cowards; and yet I don't know how to think them ſo, ſince they DARE <hi>marry.</hi>

               <p>I would gladly know what End is attained by Matrimony; you ſay, and 'tis admitted, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor has had particular Favours granted him by the Fair Sex, and that he's no Novice to their Charms. What Excuſe has he then for Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? only an idle Curioſity, to try whether the Pleaſures a Woman affords you, that has ſordidly tied you Neck and Heels in Loads of Parchments and Settlements, and who would have differ'd with you, if your Eſtate had fell ſhort of being adequate to her Fortune by 5l. a Year; whether thoſe Pleaſures are more refined, than thoſe of a truly generous-ſpirited Girl, that obliges
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1010300800:127"/>
you without Signing and Sealing. And there's one Thing remarkable, that the latter neither expects nor deſires your Affections any longer than ſhe, by her continuing agreeable, merits them; and in caſe, as in all other fair Dealings, you don't like her, you are at your Liberty to act as you pleaſe: But the former, in caſe ſhe does not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Sample of her Face, (the only one you are permitted to have) and proves diſagreeable, ſhe ſticks to you for Life; and, as if touched with Birdlime, the more you ſtruggle, the leſs you have Power ſo to do.</p>
               <p>But to return to my Eſtimate, I can't conceive why I ſhould, as I find I have, made ſo many of the Fair Sex my Enemies. Says one, I will certainly pull him by the Noſe, another threatens to box my Ears, a third excludes me from the Tea-Table, I am forbid to make my uſual Viſits to them. But what is moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, thoſe Viragoes I find are all out of the Caſe, my Eſtimate has nothing to do with them; for their Fortunes are ſo ſmall, (excluſive of their own dear Perſons, which ſome more amorous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen may think Fortune enough) that they won't bear to be eſtimated: But did they but rightly conſider, is it not more generous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain, even tho' contrary to Inclination, as I propoſed, till my Circumſtances can afford to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1010300800:128"/>
maintain a Woman genteelly, than marry, and with both our Fortunes but juſt barely ſubſiſt?</p>
               <p>Did young Fellows before they marry, but coolly ſit down and conſider what they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, and make proper Eſtimates, 'tis to be hoped the Number of miſerable Wives, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided Children, would be very much diminiſh'd. But in anſwer to all that can be alledg'd of the Expenſiveneſs of a married State, the Women cry out, the Pleaſures thereof are ſo great, they are not to be rated according to any Expence, that attends the purchaſing of them. 'Tis true, Batchelors <hi>are at a Loſs</hi> to gueſs what they are; and if that will do the Fair Sex any Service, I will admit them very great, yea, next to thoſe of Heaven; for, like them, I am ſure they are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now I think on't, why do I talk of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? I can have no Hopes of ſuch Happineſs, each fair Lady is determined not to have the wicked calculating Batchelor, (tho' they'd do well to ſtay till they are aſk'd) no, not if he was worth 50, 000 <hi>l.</hi> But why? becauſe he told the Truth. If that's to be the Caſe, (tho' I don't ſay I will not have them if they were worth ſo much) and I muſt have NO WIFE, I ſay CONTENT; or to uſe the Words of a Great Man of the Law, BE IT SO.</p>

From what I have ſaid, I would not have you think I diſlike Matrimony, or that I would caſt an Odium on, or ridicule that State, as ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Batchelors do: Say they, Matrimony is like a hungry Dog and a Bone; no ſooner is the Bone found, but the Dog, wonderfully pleas'd with the Adventure, endeavours all he can to devour it; but alter the Poſition of the Bone, take it and tie it to his Tail, the poor Creature runs from it with all his Speed, nor is he eaſy till he gets rid of it. Nor can I commend a Gentleman pretty well known in Town, that lay in almoſt the worſt Condition the Gratification of a looſe Paſſion could bring him to, who cry'd out in a faultering Tone to his Friend and Viſitor, <hi>Even This,</hi> TOM, <hi>is better than Matrimony.</hi>
