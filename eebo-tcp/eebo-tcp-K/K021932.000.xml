            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE three firſt of the following Caſes have already, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, been communicated to the Publick, through the Candour of the <hi>Learned Gentleman</hi> to whom they are addreſs'd.</p>
            <p>It may be ſeemingly unneceſſary therefore perhaps to publiſh them again: But as there is ſomething in each of them which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and One of them in particular, ſeems to clear up a Point of conſiderable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence with reſpect to <hi>Inoculation,</hi> it cannot be amiſs, I think, to give them a Chance at leaſt, of being, if poſſible, a little more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: Beſides, there are ſeveral Additions to the two laſt of them ſince they were ſent to the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt of the other Caſes are taken from ſome <hi>Adverſaria,</hi> or Manuſcript Notes, which I have, as well as an Account of ſeveral Diſeaſes, both Acute and Chronical, in Manuſcript like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:0198101400:3"/>of Dr. <hi>Browne</hi>'s, Son of the famous<note n="*" place="bottom">Author of the <hi>Religio Medici.</hi>
                  <q>Nec ſatis eſt vulgaſſe Fidem —</q> but the Author likewiſe of <hi>Pſeudodoxia Epidemica,</hi> and of ſeveral other valuable Treatiſes.</note> Sir <hi>Thomas Browne,</hi> and who was himſelf likewiſe a Perſon of great Learning and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and <hi>Phyſician</hi> to St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpital</hi> for upwards of ſix and twenty Years, and ſucceeded therein by Dr. <hi>Cade,</hi> in <hi>October, Anno Domini, 1708.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of them was communicated to him by one <hi>R. G.</hi> an <hi>Apothecary</hi> at the <hi>Bath,</hi> and the Minutes of it are ſaid to have been taken from Mr. <hi>Long</hi>'s own Mouth, as may be ſeen by the ſaid <hi>R. G</hi>'s Letter, dated <hi>July 11, 1692,</hi> and is by no means an inaccurate Relation. The three others, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dormer</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s, and the Marquis of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>'s, came directly within his own Obſervation, and have ſomething in them which is very well worth Notice, as well as that brief Account of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> which is chiefly likewiſe taken from his Manuſcript Papers.</p>
            <p>There are but two Caſes beſides; One of them, of the ſame kind with That in the firſt <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Folkes,</hi> tho' not of the ſame fortunate Event: The other, taken from <hi>Tulpius,</hi> which I hope there is no occaſion to make any Apology for, eſpecially conſidering how appoſite it ſeems to be to ſome of thoſe Obſervations, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
<pb facs="tcp:0198101400:4"/>to me upon Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s Caſe, and to <hi>another Caſe of the Stone</hi> which has lately made a great deal of Noiſe in the World.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Letter</hi> of Dr. <hi>Freind</hi>'s to Dr. <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> which is added after theſe Caſes, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in <hi>the Epiſtle</hi> that precedes it: I have nothing further therefore, I think, to trouble the World with at preſent,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AKING Bloody Water is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally eſteem'd as terrible a Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom as any that can happen in the Small-Pox, and all who have wrote concerning that Diſtemper do una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly agree, that it is a certain Forerunner of approaching Death. Dr. <hi>Cade</hi> indeed ſays, in his Letter to Dr. <hi>Friend</hi> concerning Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Diſtemper, that he has ſometimes cur'd this Symptom by the help of Camphire,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0198101400:7"/>and a copious Quantity of Acids; but then he adds, that this Relief was only temporary, and that, to confeſs the Truth, he never knew any Body that made that ſort of Water, who ever ſurviv'd the 16th Day from the Eruption, and <hi>there is no Body whom I know of,</hi> that has been converſant in this Diſtemper, but has conſtantly experienc'd, ſooner or later, the like Fatality in conſequence of it: I mean, when this ſort of Urine has plainly proceeded from a broken Craſis or Contexture, or as it were a thorough Diſſolution of the whole Maſs of Blood: For I know very well you ſhall now and then have ſeveral Streaks, and ſometimes larger Quantities of Blood, in the Urine, from the Acrimony of the Salts that are in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flies, upon the Application of Bliſters, which are frequently ordered, and <hi>moſtly likewiſe</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in one or other of the <hi>Stadia</hi> of this Diſtemper, and yet the Patient ſhall do well. And Dr. <hi>Browne,</hi> who was a very worthy Predeceſſor of mine in St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, gives an Account of a Gentlewoman that liv'd in <hi>Dean's Yard, Weſtminſter,</hi> who made bloody Urine in the Small-Pox, for four or five Days together, and that Dr. <hi>Needham,</hi> who attended her <hi>along</hi> with him, did, upon that account, forſake her, and yet ſhe did well; but that they found afterwards, that this bloody Urine was not occaſion'd by the Malignancy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0198101400:8"/>of the Diſtemper, but by a ſharp Stone which was at that time deſcending from one of the Kidneys, through the Ureters, into the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and which ſhe afterwards voided. This I have from ſome <hi>Adverſaria</hi> of his, a good number of which I have had the fortune to be in poſſeſſion of ſeveral Years, and among which there are likewiſe ſeveral other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Caſes that occurr'd to him during the courſe of a very long and extenſive, as well as ſucceſsful Practice.</p>
            <p>But to return to my Subject.</p>
            <p>It cannot but be a Satisfaction therefore, to a Perſon of your Humanity and Goodneſs, to hear of an Inſtance in which this frightful Symptom was not attended with its uſual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; and it was in the Caſe of a young Gentleman of about 16 Years of Age, Son to one Colonel <hi>Ellitſon,</hi> a Gentleman of very conſiderable Fortune and Worth in <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was taken with a Fever and great Pain in his Head on <hi>April</hi> the 20th laſt, and had the Small-Pox come out upon him the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, notwithſtanding which the ſame Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſtill continued, and <hi>nothing almoſt</hi> would ſtay in his Stomach, and his Head likewiſe was very delirious: <hi>He was oblig'd therefore to be</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0198101400:9"/>blooded, and had Bliſters applied to his Neck and to his Arms, which, together with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Quantity of <hi>Pulvis e chelis Cancror. comp.</hi> and Nitre, were the firſt Things that I had an Opportunity of ordering for him.</p>
            <p>The next Day every thing was more quiet, and ſo again the third Day from the Eruption; but the Small-Pox were very numerous all over him, and of a rank angry Sort, as they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are, I think, in moſt of your <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Conſtitutions; but this young Gentleman had beſides overheated himſelf a little before, upon acting his Part among the reſt of his School-Fellows, at the <hi>Montum</hi> near <hi>Eaton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things continued in the ſame State the fourth Day, but towards the Evening there were a few Streaks of Blood mix'd with, and ſubſiding in his Water, which did not much alarm me, becauſe I did not know but it might be caus'd by the Bliſters. I had but one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt the contrary, and that was, he had little or no Strangury; but ſome Perſons did aſſure me that they had known ſuch, or even a more bloody ſort of Water occaſion'd by Bliſters, even tho' there was no Strangury.

            <p>What was order'd happen'd to ſucceed: We had no more of that ſort of Water, either
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0198101400:10"/>that Night, or the next Day, or the Morning following: But I was ſent for in a great hurry that Day, <hi>viz.</hi> the 6th in the Afternoon, and found his Friends in the utmoſt Conſternation, not only becauſe it return'd, but becauſe it began to increaſe upon them, and was pouring off in a very free manner;<note n="*" place="bottom">No Notice was taken of this, either to the Society, or in the Account which is given of this Affair in the <hi>Tranſactions,</hi> the Reaſons for which you will ſee towards the Beginning of the ſubſequent Letter.</note> a Specimen of which I herewith ſend you.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> DID myſelf the Pleaſure, ſome time ſince, to ſend you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a young Gentleman who made Bloody Water in the Courſe of the Small-Pox, and yet recover'd, and you were ſo obliging as to give it a Place in a ſubſequent <hi>Tranſaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one Thing however which I could wiſh had not been omitted, and <hi>that</hi> is, that I ſent you likewiſe a Sample of that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0198101400:13"/>by which you might ſee whether it was, or was not, of that formidable Sort which I took it to be; but Dr. <hi>Mortimer</hi> tells me, there were ſeveral Gentlemen at the Society who had never had the Small-Pox, and that ſome of them might probably be very much afraid of it, and that it was not therefore thought adviſeable that the ſaid Sample ſhou'd be produc'd, and that it not having been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd before the Society he, through Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, did forget to take any Notice of it in the Publication.</p>
               <p>The Caſe muſt therefore reſt upon the bare Relation, as it does: All that I ſhall ſay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in relation to it is, That it was a more thorough bloody Urine, and in a larger Quantity, than is ever occaſion'd by Bliſters, and entirely of that kind as ſeldom ever fails to be fatal: <hi>Et quamvis Remedia propoſita ſint vulgaria, hic Caſus tamen obſervationem meruit propter Eventum non vulgarem, ex omnibus enim Variolis laborantibus quos mihi totâ vitâ videre contigit, hic unicus fuit qui ex Fluxu ſanguineo evaſerit, ſed in caeteris certum Mortis praeſagium fuit, magnâ prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertim ſanguinis copiâ affluente;</hi> as <hi>Riverius</hi> had the Good-fortune to be able to ſay before me, in a parallel Caſe which came before him, <hi>Centur. primâ Obſervation:,</hi> — Obſervat. lxxi. — I call it a parallel Caſe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0198101400:14"/>tho' This was a <hi>Fluxus Alvei,</hi> becauſe the Prognoſtick is the ſame, whether the Effuſion of Blood be <hi>per Alveum, vel per Veſicam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I have to offer to you now is a Caſe of a different Nature, but an Inſtance like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Recovery of a Gentleman who had this Diſtemper in as terrible a manner as can well be conceiv'd, and that by a Regimen altogether as extraordinary.</p>
               <p>It was one Mr. <hi>Prouſe,</hi> Grandſon to the learned and good Dr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> at that time Biſhop of <hi>Bath and Wells,</hi> and the preſent worthy and ſteady Repreſentative of his Country for the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and is taken from a Letter which was ſent to a Friend of mine, from one of the neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that Mr. <hi>Prouſe</hi> had, and who was with him during the whole time, <hi>viz.</hi> his Mother, dated <hi>October</hi> 31, 1719.</p>
               <p>He had the Small-Pox came out upon him <hi>October</hi> 15, 1719, and on the 17th, <hi>i. e.</hi> the third Day, at Night, was ſeiz'd with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Shortneſs of Breath, which increas'd upon him the 18th in the Morning, ſo that he was in danger of being what they call throttled, had the Hiccups, rattled in his Throat, fetch'd his Breath double, grew ſenſeleſs, look'd black and blue, was convuls'd all over, and loſt one Pulſe in four.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0198101400:15"/>
               <p>This till Eight at Night, during which time they pour'd in as much Wine, Brandy, and Spirits, as they cou'd, every Quarter of an Hour, but about that time he began to be in ſuch a State as they cou'd not get in any more, and he fell into a ſort of Slumber, out of which he wak'd in a very little time, and was ſomething better: So from thence they continued him in the ſame Courſe, drinking nothing weaker than Strong Beer, and that with at leaſt two or three Spoonfuls of Brandy, or Spirits, in every Draught of it, once every Hour, to the 27th, or the 13th after the Eruption: And what is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, if they let him lie any time an Hour or two extraordinary without theſe Liquors, he would grow light-headed, hot, and ſick, but upon returning to them would grow cool and eaſy.</p>
               <p>The Night between the 27th and the 28th was a very bad one, inſomuch that it was as much as three Perſons cou'd do to hold him in his Bed, but about Seven in the Morning he came entirely to himſelf, and was from that time thoroughly out of Danger; but during the Courſe that he was in before, which was from the 18th to the Morning of the 28th, beſides his other Potables, which were all heighten'd and made ſtrong with Drops or Spirits, he drank ſix and twenty
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0198101400:16"/>Quarts and one Pint of Liquor, the ſmalleſt of which was Strong Beer, and the greateſt part the ſtrongeſt Wine that cou'd be got, beſides a full Quart of Brandy.</p>
               <p>All this while he did not know that it was the Small-Pox, but fancied it was a Surfeit which he had got by his having eaten too heartily of Pork, and was about 12 Years old when this happen'd.</p>
               <p>The Eclat of this Recovery did a great deal of Credit to old Dr. <hi>Bettenſon,</hi> under whoſe Care he was at the <hi>Bath,</hi> who, as he was a very eminent and good Phyſician, did every thing incumbent upon a Perſon of Skill and Integrity in a regular manner, previous to theſe terrible Appearances, but found himſelf, as he thought then, oblig'd to go a good deal out of the way, in order to ſupport him, if poſſible, under the Violence of them, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in a manner neceſſitated to go on with it by what is above related: And his Succeſs in this Caſe, if I am rightly inform'd, encourag'd him to treat ſome of his future Small-Pox Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, more particularly the preſent Earl <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> and a Brother or two of his, in much the ſame manner, and that without any ſiniſter Event; but not being Maſter of thoſe Caſes, I can't ſay any thing more as to them.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0198101400:17"/>
               <p>Give me leave only to remark, That the Gentlemen of that County have, for the moſt part, good <hi>Stamina,</hi> and that it happens like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very fortunately, eſpecially in Caſes of ſuch extreme Danger as that of Mr. <hi>Prouſe</hi> was, <hi>ut &amp; ſint,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>dura Ilia, &amp; ut, quicquid Veneni ſaeviat in praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis, Medici ſinnt, qui iis auxiliatricem expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigant manum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I did not think to trouble you with any thing more at preſent, but another Small-Pox Caſe being lately come to my Hands, I was not willing to loſe the Opportunity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it.</p>
               <p>It is the Caſe of a little Boy, Son to Mr. <hi>Richards,</hi> Member of Parliament for <hi>Bridport</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire.</hi> He was inoculated about three Years ago, at the Age of about 3, and had the Small-Pox come out upon him to the number of 50 or 60, and they matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſcabb'd, and went off in the ſame manner that that ſort of Pock, which was a regular and diſtinct one, generally does: But about two Years afterwards, <hi>i. e.</hi> about a Year ago, he had the Small-Pox again, and there came out between 2 and 300, which maturated and ſcabb'd likewiſe, and went through the ſame Stages, and in the ſame manner that the former did, only he was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0198101400:18"/>worſe before the Eruption, but when that was compleated had no manner of Diſorder except too much of an Appetite, as is uſual every now and then, in and after the Small-Pox.</p>
               <p>This is authenticated to me by a Letter which I have from a learned and experienced Phyſician in thoſe Parts, Dr. <hi>Brodrepp,</hi> who is likewiſe Grandfather to the Child, and attended him upon both Occaſions: And, whatever may be ſaid in evaſion of other Gaſes, in which Perſons that have been inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated have had the Small-Pox afterwards, as That the Inoculation did not take place, There was no Eruption, at leaſt no Variolous one, and the like, is certainly an Inſtance that All is not to be depended upon that is given out in favour of, or is expected from Inoculation, and that it is, by no means, an effectual Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from one's having the Small-Pox again.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">What is between theſe two <hi>Aſterisks,</hi> added now upon the Printing.</note> But, as it has been obſerved long ſince by the inimitable Author of <hi>Hudibraſs,</hi>

               <q>
                  <l>Surety the Pleaſure is as great</l>

               </q>
               <p>or elſe it is impoſſible that Inoculation ſhou'd triumph ſo much as it is ſaid<note n="†" place="margin">Appendix to Dr. <hi>Jurin</hi>'s Caſe, p. 28.</note> that it does over all its Oppoſers?<note n="*" place="margin">What is between theſe two <hi>Aſterisks,</hi> added now upon the Printing.</note>

                  <hi>POSTSCRIPT</hi> to the above Letter.</head>
               <p>SINCE I wrote this, I have likewiſe had an Opportunity of being afreſh ſatisfied of what is above related with reſpect to Mr. <hi>Prouſe,</hi> with theſe further Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he was at firſt treated in the ſame manner that other People uſually are, and put into a very temperate, if not too cool a Regimen.</p>
               <p>That the Small-Pox, thereupon, did not come on, or rather ſtruck in, and that in conſequence thereof, he was brought into the Straits in which he was upon the third and fourth Days.</p>
               <p>That, upon this, Dr. <hi>Bettenſon</hi> told Mr. <hi>Prouſe</hi>'s Relations, of the good Effects which he had ſometimes ſeen from a free Uſe of Strong and Spirituous Liquors, in his Practice among People in the Country, but did not care to venture upon it in a Perſon of ſuch tender Years, and of ſuch conſequence as Mr. <hi>Prouſe</hi> was; but that it was inſiſted upon that he ſhou'd do it, it being apparently a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Caſe, and there being nothing elſe ſeemingly to be done.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0198101400:21"/>
               <p>That they accordingly enter'd upon it, and went on with it, but more frequently than as it is above mention'd, being never able to diſcontinue the pouring in of them by as much as he cou'd take, for a Quarter of an Hour, without a ſenſible Detriment to him.</p>
               <p>That the Strong Beer which he drank was ſome that his Grandfather had brewed when he was Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and brought with him from thence, which was then a matter of ſixteen Years before, and of the Black or Noggiſh ſort, of near 20 Buſhels to the Hogſhead.</p>
               <p>That the good Event of this Proceſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd a pretty general Run into a like one, in thoſe Parts, during the time that the Small-Pox was ſo rife, and of ſo malignant a Sort, as it was that Winter and the Spring following, and that the Failure of it in ſome Inſtances was thought to be owing to too negligent an Attendance to it, or the not plying them duly and ſufficiently with ſuch-like Liquors.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, That it had been generally thought that Mr. <hi>Prouſe</hi>'s Cure, extraordinary as it was, could not well be aſcrib'd to any thing elſe, but that <hi>a Phyſician of the firſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0198101400:22"/>Rank,</hi> who, has been concern'd in his Family, ſeem'd to make light of it, and very frankly told them that he wou'd have done every whit as well if old <hi>Bettenſon</hi> had order'd him to have been dragg'd through a Horſe-pond: At which, I perceive, they were ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, and which is more indeed than I ſhou'd have thought, had it come from <hi>One of leſs Eminence in the Profeſſion, or leſs critical upon the Practice of others than himſelf:</hi> But preſume that he took it from a very good <hi>Way</hi> that they have <hi>of curing Fevers among the Tartars</hi>

               <p>It was in a Servant of my own, a Lad of about 19 Years old, who was ſeiz'd with a <hi>violent Pain in his Back,</hi> which he imputed to his having help'd the Brewer's Servants in carrying down Drink; but which continuing, notwithſtanding he was blooded and had a Plaiſter put upon it, and being attended like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with a Pain in his Head (tho' not a great one) the Day following, I immediately appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that it was the Forerunner of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and that of a bad Sort; I ſay of a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0198101400:24"/>bad Sort, becauſe I have ſcarce ever known that Symptom to have preceded and to perſiſt, but the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> has proved of a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Sort, and almoſt conſtantly fatal: Which is more than I remember to have been obſerv'd by any body that has hitherto treated concerning this Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>The Eruption enſued, <hi>i. e.</hi> began to ſhew itſelf, on the third Day, and <hi>Bloody Water</hi> upon the fourth from that, or the ſeventh from the Invaſion, and continued that and the next Day, and great part of the Day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and there were other Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Delirium</hi> and <hi>Diarrhoea, and great Reſtleſneſs and Inquietude,</hi> which attended him likewiſe from juſt before the Eruption to almoſt that time, notwithſtanding he had been Blooded again, and had a Bliſter <hi>inter Scapulas,</hi> and taken all proper temperate Reſtringents the whole while.</p>
               <p>What was farther remarkable in this Caſe is, that he went on pretty tolerably for Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Sort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after this until the fifteenth Day, but was then ſeiz'd with a ſudden <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium,</hi> and in ſuch a State that it was almoſt impracticable to get any thing down, and he was ſeemingly expiring. They made a ſhift however to get down, every now and then, a Spoonful or two of <hi>Lac Ammoniac</hi> and <hi>Tinctura Croci,</hi> with ſome <hi>Serpentaria</hi> in it,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0198101400:25"/>and a couple of Bliſters were applied <hi>infra Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitos,</hi> by means of which he came to himſelf, and was likely enough to live the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and continuing ſo that Day, which was the Sixteenth from the Eruption, and which has been obſerv'd<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Caſe I.

               <p>The <hi>Small-Pox</hi> is a contagious Diſtemper, and as terrible as any of them, very many dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, more particularly when it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied, as it generally is, with a Fever of a dangerous Kind.</p>
               <p>This, when they are many, or of the Flux, or Confluent Sort; on the contrary, when the Patient has but a few, and the Fever ceaſes upon the Eruption, no Diſeaſe is more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, and you may ſometimes meet them walking about their Affairs, with the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> in their Faces, in the open Streets of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Diſeaſe likewiſe in which there is more of a Criſis than in the <hi>Small-Pox;</hi> for by the fourth Day, at furtheſt, after the Invaſion, the Eruption is evident; by the ſeventh it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or all are come out; by the eleventh they dry away, or turn into Scabs; and by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0198101400:27"/>the fourteenth they fall off; tho' in the Flux Sort they are often ſlower, and ſome die after the fourteenth, nay on the ſeventeenth, and twentieth Days, altho' few have Strength enough to hold out ſo long.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Fever,</hi> as has been ſaid, generally joined with the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and when it ceaſes not upon the Eruption, apt however for ſome Days after it to be more remiſs: but on the ſeventh from the Eruption it increaſes again, and returns with ſome Violence; and this is what is generally called the <hi>Second Fever,</hi> and occaſions the Danger, which continues for ſome Days: Nay in the Flux Sort ſome are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as to have <hi>a third Fever</hi> ſeven Days after the ſecond, in which Caſe very few eſcape.</p>

            <head>The Fifth Caſe.</head>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dormer,</hi> who lodg'd then in <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> had a very ill Sort of <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> which ran all together, and covered moſt of the Superficies of his Skin, both in Face and Body, and was in danger from the Beginning. When the time came that they ſhou'd dry away, and the <hi>ſecond Fever</hi> increas'd upon him, they ſtood <hi>like a Quagmire</hi> all about him, and wou'd advance no further, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding many powerful Remedies were given
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0198101400:29"/>him. In this difficult Caſe <hi>the Doctor</hi> delayed no longer, but gave him <hi>a Drachm of the Bark</hi> in Subſtance, and repeated it every ſix Hours at furtheſt, till he had taken about <hi>an Ounce and an half of it.</hi> His Nights were ſo bad before, notwithſtanding many quieting Remedies which he had taken, that each of them, as it was fear'd, wou'd be his laſt; but the firſt Night after he began with the <hi>Bark</hi> was quieter, and the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> on both Sides of his Face began to dry; the ſecond Night his Face was all dried, and ſome of his Body ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd very much, and after the third Night all the Symptoms abated, and he ſeem'd to be in great Safety, and very ſuddenly recover'd to the great Joy of all his numerous Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Doctor</hi>'s general <hi>Proceſs</hi> as to this Diſtemper upon other Occaſions, much the ſame as has been ever ſince, <hi>except as to Bleeding,</hi> which he reſtrains to a Plethoric Habit, and the Time before the Eruption; tho' at the ſame time he informs us, that at <hi>Paris</hi> they let them Blood any Day after the Appearance, but ſays this is not practis'd here in <hi>England; and</hi> excepting likewiſe <hi>as to Bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> which he does not ſo much as adviſe the Uſe of, or make any mention of in the whole Country, or in any State of the Diſeaſe, and which I am the more ſurprized at, becauſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0198101400:30"/>he takes great Notice of them, and adviſes one at leaſt to be kept continually open and running during the whole courſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, in Malignant and Peſtilential Fevers, and ſays that the great Uſe of them came firſt to be known during the <hi>Peſtilential Conſtitution,</hi> which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1664 and 1665, and had continued ever ſince.</p>
            <p>The reſt of his Proceſs, <hi>Pectoral Drinks, Lambatives, and Poſſet-Drink, with Tares</hi> in it in caſe that the Lungs, and <hi>Gargles and Mucilages</hi> in caſe that the Throat is affected, together with <hi>Diaſcordium, Theriaca,</hi> or <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonium,</hi> in caſe of a Looſeneſs, <hi>and an Ounce of Diacodium</hi> every Night in caſe of Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and, if the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> prove long laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome temperate Cordial, and to ſupply the Spirits often with a Draught of it, in caſe of Faintneſs, and <hi>thorough Purging</hi> when the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> is well off, and the Patient fit for it.</p>
            <p>There is one thing further which the <hi>Doctor</hi> takes notice of, and that is, that many Waters, Oils and Unguents, or Liniments, are frequently made uſe of, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Face, after the <hi>Small-Pox;</hi> all which he thinks altogether uſeleſs, if not hurtful; and that a little Flower, or white Starch, well dried, and ſhaken upon the Face, is preferable to them all. Nay, if you let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0198101400:31"/>that is moiſt, or greaſy, touch the Face for fifteen Days, the Face, he ſays, will ſcarce be red, at leaſt not ſo red as it will otherwiſe be; and if for a long while after you forbear to waſh it, it will be the better, and the moſt that you need to do is to breathe upon a warm Handkerchief, and to wipe your Face with it.</p>

In conſequence of this likewiſe, the <hi>Joints of his Fingers</hi> became <hi>crooked</hi> and inflexible; the <hi>Patella</hi> of his right Knee <hi>fix'd;</hi> his <hi>Poſture</hi> decrepit, and <hi>quite double,</hi> with extreme Pain in his Hips and Small of the Back; the <hi>Muſcles</hi> and <hi>Joints</hi> of his <hi>Thighs, Legs, Ancles,</hi> and <hi>Feet, motionleſs,</hi> ſo that he was carried about from Place to Place, not able to put the leaſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0198101400:33"/>Streſs upon the Ground; his Stomach, loſt; his thirſt, unquenchable; his Face meagre, pale and yellow; the <hi>Hair of his Head, gray,</hi> and <hi>the whole Habit of his Body, emaciated</hi> to Skin and Bones. To theſe Afflictions were frequently added, <hi>terrible Fits of the Stone,</hi> to which ſort of Concretions the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of his Body were ſo much diſpos'd, that after ſix Weeks uſe of the <hi>Bath Waters,</hi> leaving his Waters, by chance, for ſeven Days, the <hi>Urinal</hi> was <hi>cruſted all over</hi> with a perfect hard Stone <hi>like a Pumice,</hi> thicker than a Crown-piece.</p>
            <p>This was his Caſe when he began to drink the <hi>Bath Waters</hi> at the End of <hi>April,</hi> 1691; and he drank them hot in the Morning, and cold at Meals; and in a little time was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them for his conſtant Drink, without Deſire of any other. In a Week's time his Stomach came, and his Thirſt abated; and after a Month's conſtantly Drinking, and <hi>Bathing every other Day</hi> a little while, only to ſtretch his Joints, it gave him perfect Eaſe from Pain.</p>
            <p>The 28th of <hi>May</hi> he return'd home, and carried ſome of the Waters along with him, and ſent for them conſtantly once a Week, uſing them for his ordinary Drink, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drinking them warm in the Morning for a Stool or two, as Occaſion required, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0198101400:34"/>they paſs'd very well, but not ſo effectually as upon the Place. This Courſe continued till the End of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1691, when he came to the <hi>Bath</hi> again, Drinking and <hi>Bathing</hi> as at the firſt, till the Middle of <hi>October,</hi> with increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Succeſs; but towards that time he went home again, and ſent and continued to uſe the Waters as before.</p>
            <p>Between <hi>Allhallowtide</hi> and <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> the Gray Hairs began to fall off, and new ones ſucceeded; and by <hi>Candlemas</hi> they were all gone, and a brown, curling Hair came in their place, ſuch as he had when he was about 20, growing ſo faſt, that he was oblig'd to cut above an Inch a Month, and ſtill growing thicker and freſher, ſo that he had a Head of Hair like a Wig, without a gray one in it.</p>
            <p>This encourag'd him to quit his own Houſe, and come and take a Houſe at the <hi>Bath,</hi> and to renew and purſue the above Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod very diligently, and it was accordingly attended with daily Amendment, inſomuch that in the <hi>Summer,</hi> 1692, <hi>his Toe-Nails,</hi> which before were hard, rugged, and ſcaly, were thruſt off by ſome that were <hi>new,</hi> freſh, and ſmooth; his Arms were ſtrengthen'd; his Legs plump'd out, and his Feet cou'd bear a ſtrait pair of Shoes; and he that before cou'd not lay the leaſt Streſs upon them, cou'd then
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0198101400:35"/>bear to ſtamp upon the Ground, and that forcibly, and without the leaſt Regret, and found his Strength, as he had done his Decay, ſtill increaſing upwards, ſo that he could ſtand almoſt upright without any Pain.</p>
            <p>He acquired likewiſe a fleſhy Habit of Body, and a ruddy and plump Face, and a lively vigorous Eye, and cou'd bend his Knees, and <hi>did not want other Effects or Powers of Youth:</hi> Nor had he any Fit of the Gout to lay him up, nor the leaſt Touch of the Stone, or any Sharpneſs of Urine, after he was once well enter'd into drinking of the <hi>Bath-Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Caſe</hi> is related, among a great many others, by Dr. <hi>Peirce</hi> in <hi>his Memoirs of</hi> the <hi>Bath,</hi> Page 334, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but neither ſo clearly, nor ſo fully as above; upon which account I take the liberty to publiſh it, and think that it is ſo remarkable and <hi>well-told a Caſe</hi> that it very well deſerves the Notice which is taken of it; and there is thus much farther remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Cure ſeems to be, in a great meaſure, owing to the <hi>Bathing,</hi> as well as Drinking of the Waters, tho' it is now thought to be extremely prejudicial, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently prohibited to all who are in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner afflicted with the GOUT.</p>

            <p>After this he ſlept four Hours, <hi>viz.</hi> from Eight to Twelve, before his Servants perceived any thing of the Miſtake, or attempted to wake him; but then they could not, tho' they did what they could, and therefore ſent immediately from <hi>Highgate,</hi> where his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip then was, to Dr. <hi>Browne</hi> and Sir <hi>John Micklethwaite</hi> to come and attend him.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. <hi>Hales,</hi> Brother to Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> had <hi>Stones in both Kidneys,</hi> and it ſo happen'd, that the Stones on each ſide deſcended together, and ſtopp'd, or plugg'd up both the Ureters in ſuch a manner, that he labour'd under a <hi>total Suppreſſion of Urine for</hi> twenty Days together. Dr. <hi>Browne</hi> viſited him from the Beginning of it, and gave him <hi>Glyſters</hi> and <hi>Purges,</hi> and order'd him to be <hi>blooded</hi>ſeveral times, and as often as he could bear it for the Pain, to go from his Brother's Chambers in the <hi>Temple,</hi> where he lodg'd, as far as to <hi>Hyde-Park</hi> in a Coach: He gave him <hi>Vomits</hi> likewiſe, eſpecially if ever he began to be drowſy, which frequently happen'd, and they were of <hi>Vitriol. alb. Oxymel of Squills,</hi> and <hi>Vin. Benedictum,</hi> as his <hi>Purges</hi> were of <hi>Decoct.

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0198101400:47"/>chiefly becauſe he hop'd they wou'd prove <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragogues,</hi> and help to carry off the Serous Parts of the Blood, leſt they ſhou'd otherwiſe break in upon, and drown the Brain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe and other Medicines</hi> were <hi>given,</hi> ſcarce any thing being omitted that cou'd any ways contribute either to the Support of him, or to the ſuppling of the Paſſages, or the making a Diſcharge of the Stone, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, more eaſy; notwithſtanding which there was no Relief, only that he was kept ſtill alive.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>the Doctor</hi> thought of <hi>Caſtile Soap,</hi> and gave him not a little, but from two or three Drachms <hi>to an Ounce,</hi> and <hi>an Ounce and an half,</hi> and to <hi>two and more Ounces</hi> at a time, diſſolv'd in Water, 'till he had taken two Pounds of it, and at laſt there came away <hi>a Stuff,</hi> and ſome Water followed.—This Stuff was ſeparated, as <hi>the Doctor</hi> imagines, from the Inſide of the Ureter, and there came away <hi>a</hi> large <hi>Stone</hi> along with it, and wrapt up in it, beſides ſeveral other ſmall ones, and Dirt and Skin, and the gangren'd Membrane, <hi>and</hi> after that a <hi>foul and naſty Urine,</hi> and then, <hi>viz.</hi> the next Day in the Morning, a great Quantity of Water.—What he took afterwards was <hi>Terebinthina Veneta,</hi> and other ſoft and gentle Medicines of the ſame Tendency, and all was well.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0198101400:48"/>
            <p>This is a remarkable Account of a very happy Effect from the Uſe of <hi>Soap,</hi> and an Inſtance how free it may be made with, even to a Degree which is almoſt incredible. But then it muſt be conſider'd, that <hi>this</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>an almoſt gone Caſe,</hi> and of extreme Exigence: Every thing elſe, in a manner, had been tried, and there was no other Chance for his Survival. In which ſort of Caſes it is not only the Judgment, but warrantable, to give things of the greateſt Efficacy, and that, not only in the common trifling Way and Doſes, but to the utmoſt Stretch that either the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient can bear, or the Medicine ſhall be found not to be going beyond the <hi>anceps Remedium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved likewiſe, that the Effect which this Medicine had, was merely to bring away the Stuff, Stone, <hi>&amp;c. Soap,</hi> more particularly that of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> being, as Dr. <hi>Browne</hi> (immediately previous to this Caſe) has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, an <hi>excellent Diuretick;</hi> the Subtilty of its Parts, and <hi>the Activity and Aſperity of its Salts, ſoften'd</hi> by means of their Union <hi>with an Oil,</hi> admirably qualifying it to ſtimulate and deterge, as well as to relax the Urinary Paſſages, and conſequently to facilitate the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of any thing that wants to paſs off that way.</p>
            <p>How far it is capable of being improv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to further Excellencies, and to become a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thontriptick,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0198101400:49"/>or poſſeſs'd of the Virtue to break or diſſolve the Stone in a human Body, I won't pretend to determine. Dr. <hi>Browne,</hi> tho' he has mention'd ſeveral things which are thought to be ſo, does not ſeem to think that any thing is really ſo, or much to be relied upon for any ſuch Purpoſe: And <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> that <hi>faithful Obſerver,</hi> ſays, <q>"<hi>Nihil Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis frequentius in ore quam Medicamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Calculos frangens; at vide fis arenoſos &amp; molles duntaxat intelligas; Silices quippè ut vix comminuunt Mallei, ſic profectò mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tò minus acris aliquis humor, qui fortaſſis aptior foret exedendis tenuibus Veſicae tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis quam praeduris Lapidibus.</hi>"</q>—Vide <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pii Obſervationes, Lib.
