            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE art of preface-writing is, perhaps, the art of concealing the anxiety of an author. There are ſome works which require nor preface nor anxiety: the preſent trifle merits neither; yet I cannot refrain from beſtowing on it a little of both.</p>
            <p>A Diſſertation demands (and I confeſs it) a certain ſyſtematical regularity, which is above me. But a Diſſertation on Anecdotes is a thing ſo eccentric, that if, on the whole,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0187301600:3"/>
my pages are not found to weary the reader, it is juſt that he ſhould have the candour not to complain, if it does not preciſely anſwer the idea he may form of a Diſſertation.</p>
            <p>I am even deſirous, that this Eſſay may not be conſidered as deſtitute of connection, becauſe at the firſt glance it may thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. The work conſiſts not of a mere maſs of looſe anecdotes; theſe are given as ſketches of the manner in which various to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics may be conducted; and elucidate thoſe reflections on the nature of anecdotes, which, if they ſhall be found to be pertinent, is all of which I am ſolicitous. In my notes, I have taken a greater freedom of diſcuſſion; but this has been (to uſe the language of a maſter in literary compoſition) <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'with the honeſt deſire of giving uſeful pleaſure.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0187301600:4"/>
There is a ſingularity reſpecting the word <hi>Anecdote,</hi> which it is not here improper to notice. Anecdotes is an appellation given by ſcholars to Mſſ. which they diſcovered in libraries, and afterwards publiſhed. This term is ſtrictly according to its Grecian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. things not yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. Thus Cicero, as Moreri obſerves, gave the name of Anecdote to a work which he had not yet publiſhed.</p>
            <p>We have borrowed the uſe of this word, in its ordinary ſignification, from the French, who employ it for any intereſting circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In this ſenſe Varillas publiſhed Anecdotes of the family of the Medicis.</p>
            <p>Johnſon has imperfectly defined the word, by ſaying, that, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'It is now uſed after the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0187301600:5"/>
French for a <hi>biographical incident;</hi> a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute paſſage of <hi>private life.</hi>'</q> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines its ſignification merely to <hi>biography;</hi> but anecdotes are ſuſceptible of a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged application. This word is more juſtly defined in the Cyclopaedia, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'a term which (now) denotes a relation of detached and intereſting particulars.'</q> We give <hi>anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes</hi> of the art as well as the Artiſt; of the war as well as the General; of the nation as well as of the Monarch.</p>
            <p>I conclude by obſerving, that if a ſeries of anecdotes ſhall be found capable of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrating any individual topic, we yet want a collection of ſuch anecdotes. A writer for this purpoſe ſhould unite to the ardour of reſearch, a ſolid judgment and a correct taſte. Yet, with all theſe qualifications, I
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0187301600:6"/>
am fearful that the world would be more inclined to commend his induſtry, than diſtinguiſh his talents. It is, therefore, not probable, that a man of genius will conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to arrange anecdotes; and we muſt lament, that the faſtidiouſneſs of ſuperficial minds deters the ingenious ſtudent from giving the world literary ſpeculations, the moſt inſtructive, and the moſt delightful.</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION ON ANECDOTES.</head>
            <p>A Writer of periodical criticiſm<note n="*" place="bottom">The Britiſh Critic for July 1793, p. 324.</note>, has given ſome obſervations on ANEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOTES; which, becauſe they echo the voice of ſeveral men of letters, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to inveſtigate. The opinions of our critic, to me, appear erroneous, becauſe they regard anecdotes as only agreeable objects of literary amuſement. A writer ſhould correct others, or correct himſelf: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hazard this eſſay. A dry diſſertation on anecdotes appears thorny; let us try if we cannot diſcover bloſſoms and flowers.</p>
            <p>The critic ſays, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Anecdotes are among the luxuries of literature;'</q> and he is <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that the mind ſhould be accuſtomed to them, and reject ſeverer diet.'</q> I rejoice,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0187301600:8"/>
however, to be informed, in the ſame para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, that, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'they ſtimulate the appetite for reading, and create it where deficient.'</q> This logic is not in the happieſt manner of Bayle.</p>
            <p>I will not deny that anecdotes are to be placed among literary luxuries. The refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a nation influences the genius of its literature; we now require not only a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid repaſt, but a delicious deſſert. A phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, auſtere as Hippocrates, a critic, rigid as Ariſtotle, are alike inimical to our refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We will not be fooled into their ſyſtems. We do not diſmiſs our fruits and and our wines from our tables; we eat, and our health remains unprejudiced. We read anecdotes with voluptuous delight; nor is our ſcience impaired, or our wit rendered leſs brilliant.</p>
            <p>The day has paſt, when perſevering dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs obtained the honours of literary emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. A vigorous memory was then the only talent required in the ſcholar; he was the greateſt genius who read moſt. Our age does not think highly of thoſe names, once ſo celebrated. Learning, in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diffuſion, will only pleaſe as it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0187301600:9"/>
on a ſolid judgment, and embelliſhed by the graces of a fine taſte<note n="*" place="bottom">On this ſubject Scaliger has made a judicious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſays, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'If a perſon's <hi>learning</hi> is to be judged of by his <hi>reading,</hi> nobody can deny Euſebius the character of a learned man; but if he is to be eſteemed learned, who has ſhewn <hi>judgment</hi> together with his <hi>reading,</hi> Euſebius is not ſuch.'</q>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>It is therefore not juſt to conſider anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes merely as a ſource of entertainment, becauſe they amuſe; if it ſhall be ſound that they ſerve alſo for the purpoſes of utility, they will deſerve to be claſſed higher in the ſcale of ſtudy than hitherto they have been.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anecdotes ſeldom read with reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> All the world read anecdotes; but not many with reflection, and ſtill fewer with taſte. To moſt, one anecdote reſembles another; a little unconnected ſtory that is heard, that pleaſes, and is forgotten. Yet when anecdotes are not merely tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but animated by judicious reflections, they recal others of a kindred nature: one ſuggeſts another; and the whole ſeries is made to illuſtrate ſome topic that gratifies curioſity, or impreſſes on the mind ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting concluſion in the affairs of human life. Like the concord of notes, one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the other, and the whole forms a perfect harmony.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0187301600:10"/>
We will take a review of ſome of thoſe effects, which anecdotes appear capable of producing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The moſt agreeable parts of Hiſtory, conſiſt in it's anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes.</note> Hiſtory itſelf derives ſome of it's moſt agreeable inſtructions from a ſkilful intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of anecdotes. We ſhould not now dwell with anxiety on a dull chronicle of the reigns of monarchs; a pariſh regiſter might prove more intereſting. We are not now ſolicitous of attending to battles, which have ceaſed to alarm; to ſieges, which can deſtroy none of our towns; and to ſtorms, which can never burſt upon our ſhores. We turn with diſguſt from fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions told without the grace of fable, and from truths unintereſting as fables told with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Romancers have exiſted in all nations, under the names of hiſtorians, from the notorious Geffrey of Monmouth, to Jean le Maire, who in his Illuſtrations of Gaul, makes the French nation deſcend from the fugitive princes of Troy. This is not quite ſo marvellous, as the eccentric follies of ſeveral <hi>modern</hi> Iriſh antiquaries. Col. V..... has puſhed his national reſearches as far back as the time of the deluge. Since he was ſo employed he might have gone further; for an old writer has even favoured us with the names of the <hi>ſeven Iriſh Kings</hi> who flouriſhed <hi>before Noah!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. T. Warton, in his obſervations on the Faëry Queen, notices one of Geffrey's fables. This monk, in his account of the original ſtate of Albion has theſe words, <q rend="inline">'Erat tunc nomen inſulae Albion quae a nemine niſi a <hi>paucis gigantibus</hi> inhabitabatur.'</q> A <hi>few giants,</hi> in that hiſtorian's opinion, were but of little conſideration.</p>
               </note> Our hearts have learnt to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſe; and we conſult the annals of hiſtory,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0187301600:11"/>
as a ſon and a brother would turn over his domeſtic memoirs. We read hiſtory, not to indulge the frivolous inquiſitiveneſs of a dull antiquary, but to explore into the cauſes of the miſeries and the proſperities of our country. We are more intereſted in the progreſs of the human mind, than in that of empires.</p>
            <p>A Hearne would feel a frigid rapture, if he could diſcover the name of a Saxon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch unrecorded in our annals; and of whom as little ſhould remain, as of the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bones of a Saxon dug out of a tumulus. Such are his anecdotes!—A Hume is only intereſted with thoſe characters, who have exerted themſelves in the cauſe of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and with thoſe incidents, which have ſubverted or eſtabliſhed the felicities of a people<note n="*" place="bottom">There will always be antiquaries, who will ſolace themſelves with the hope, that dull induſtry will compenſate for a total want of the energy of genius. Such will not diſcern when minute enquiry dwindles into frivolous inutility. The elegance and the reflection of Hume, are regarded with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by theſe unenlightened ſtudents; and they condemn the philoſopher, preciſely for what he is moſt to be commended; for not waſting his pages on reſearches, that reſemble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, into our Saxon annals, which, if they could be known with accuracy, would not be more intereſting than the annals of the Abyſſinians, over which many a reader of taſte has groaned in the bulky volumes of Mr. Bruce. But on the ſubject of ſuch remote antiquities, I ſhall tranſcribe a converſation recorded by Mr. Boſwel, apologizing for quoting a book which is in the hands of every one. On our anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarian reſearches, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'All that is really <hi>known</hi> of the ancient ſtate of Britain, is contained in a <hi>few pages.</hi> We can know no more than what the old writers have told us; yet what large books have we upon it, the whole of which, excepting ſuch parts as are taken from thoſe old writers, is all a dream, ſuch as Whitaker's Mancheſter.—I have heard Henry's hiſtory of Great Britain well ſpoken of; I am told it is carried on in ſeparate diviſions, as the civil, the military, the religious hiſtory; I wiſh much to have one branch well done, and that is <hi>the hiſtory of manners,</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life.'</q> Robertſon anſwered, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Henry ſhould have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his attention to that <hi>alone,</hi> which is enough for any man.'</q> Vol. iii. p. 122.</note>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Anecdotes ſerve as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for the hiſtory of manners.</note> Hence the hiſtory of manners has become the prime object of the reſearches of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. How is this prominent feature in hiſtory to be depicted? The artiſt muſt not here draw at fancy, a beautiful or fantaſtical line. He muſt regard his object with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute attention, and he muſt reflect long on a thouſand little ſtrokes, which are to give the faithful reſemblance. The hiſtorian muſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0187301600:13"/>
aſſiduouſly arrange the minute anecdotes of the age he examines; he muſt oftener have recourſe to the diaries of individuals, than to the archives of a nation. Nothing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever minute, muſt eſcape his reſearch, though every thing is not to be reported<note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt be confeſſed, that our antiquarian ſtudies begin to rank high in the mind of the philoſopher. They ſeem to be directed to the illuſtration, not merely of obliterated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, but of ancient manners. The ſepulchral monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mr. Gough, form a ſplendid work of this kind, which has deſervedly gained their author the diſtinguiſhed title of the Engliſh Montfaucon. We may obſerve of what importance, in this intereſting topic, are the memorandums of an individual, from the recovery of the book of the Maſter of the Revels, which Mr. Malone has been ſo fortunate as to obtain. We enter more fully into the genius of thoſe times, from ſuch publications, than from the ſuperficial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and fanciful conjectures of any modern writer. He who would penetrate further into theſe amuſing reſearches, muſt apply himſelf to a cloſe examination of thoſe 200 4to volumes of old plays which Mr. Garrick has depoſited in the Britiſh Muſeum; to a patient peruſal of innumerable Mſſ; and to the collecting matter from the printed books of the times. The proſpect looks boundleſs and dreary; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at a diſtance a dark foreſt; yet when once explored with ardour, it wants not occaſional ſunſhine to cheer us and vernal banks to repoſe on.</note>.</p>

princes and biſhops had a right to wear ſhoes made of ſilk;—ſuch anecdotes would appear trivial in the hands of a mere anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary; but they become important when touched by a philoſophical hiſtorian. Theſe little particulars awaken, in the mind of Voltaire, an admirable reflection: he ſays, <q rend="inline">"All theſe ſumptuary laws only ſhew, that the government of theſe times had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways great objects in their view; and that it appeared eaſier for miniſters to proſcribe, than to encourage induſtry."</q>

            <p>Had I to ſketch the ſituation of the Jews in the ninth century, and to exhibit at the ſame time the character of that age of bigotry, could I do it more effectually than by the following anecdote, which a learned friend (who will one day be celebrated for his hiſtorical reſearches) diſcovered in ſome manuſcript records?</p>
            <p>A jew, of Rouen in Normandy, ſells a houſe to a chriſtian inhabitant of that city. After ſome time of reſidence, a ſtorm happens, lightning falls on the houſe, and does conſiderable damage. The chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, unenlightened, villainous, and pious, cites the trembling deſcendant of Iſrael into
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0187301600:15"/>
court for <hi>damages.</hi> His eloquent counſellor hurls an admirable philippic againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable nation of heretics, and concludes by proving, that it was owing to this houſe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been the interdicted property of an Iſraelite, that a thunderbolt fell upon the roof. The judges (as it may be ſuppoſed) were not long in terminating this ſuit. They decreed that God had damaged this houſe as a mark of his vengeance againſt the property of a jew, and that therefore it was juſt the repairs ſhould be at his coſt.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is to be acknowledged, that the judges were merciful, and the jew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate. To be condemned to rebuild a houſe, is better than to be burnt with ſome of it's old wood.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add one more inſtance which may prove, that it is alone by anecdotes the genius of an age or nation is thoroughly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <p>The French nation, before their ſingular revolution, diſplayed a ſplendid ſcene of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, of luxury, and of frivolity, which perhaps was never yet preſented to the eye of the philoſopher, on this theatre of the world. In reading the ſecret memoirs of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0187301600:16"/>
that country (a ſcandalous chronicle, which was carried on for above thirty years) one gathers many curious particulars, which can only be found in theſe fugitive leaves. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was forbidden them by the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and politics by the government. They exhauſted their active and volatile genius, on the objects of taſte; taſte, that they contrived ſhould be the image of both, for it had it's hereſies, and it's parties. The theatre, and the bookſeller's ſhop, formed the great concerns of the Pariſian. Voltaire was more to be dreaded, than the prime miniſter; and Mad. Clairon (their celebrated actreſs) appears to have enjoyed the ſovereignty of Paris.</p>
            <p>Sometimes we obſerve, that a publication ferments the town for a week; the miniſter ſends the author to the Baſtille for a month: the book is publicly burnt, forbidden to be ſold, and every body has it by heart. The police ſometimes is ſo rigid as to put an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo on all Mſſ.; to impriſon cenſors of books becauſe they ſuffered paſſages to be printed which appear to the court of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive nature; in a word, ſeveral printers are compelled to ſell their founts, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0187301600:17"/>
barrenneſs appears in the literature of France.</p>
            <p>Sometimes we perceive theatrical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations to be the objects of miniſterial vengeance. They forbid a particular play, whoſe ſubject might be applicable to the moment; or even a particular paſſage of a play, which the malicious actor pronounced with emphaſis. I give an inſtance of the latter, in the note underneath.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>On the 19th February, 1762, in playing Tancred, Mad. Clairon, when ſhe came to theſe verſes, 
<q>
                        <l>'On depouille Tancrede, on l'exile, on l'outrage,—</l>
                        <l>'C'eſt le ſort d'un Heros d'etre perſecuté—</l>

                        <l>'Sa gloire—</l>

                     </q> 
This ſublime actreſs made ſuch inflexions of her voice, ſo noble and ſo penetrating, that all the audience recollected the event of that day, which was a lettre de cachet the Marquis de Broglio had received. His name flew from mouth to mouth (ſays my reporter) and the repreſentation was frequently interrupted by the loud applauſes which were continually renewed.</p>
                  <p>The next day the houſe was forbidden to act the tragedy of Tancred, in conſequence of what had paſſed on the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repreſentation.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not my intention to fill up an elaborate picture of the French nation at theſe moments; that probably will ſoon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0187301600:18"/>
the contemplation of men of able ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.</p>
            <p>But I would give one ſtriking example of the national character at this period; and for this purpoſe I employ the following anecdotes.</p>
            <p>Molé, a favourite actor, falls ill, and is confined to his chamber; when this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced from the ſtage, the gaiety of Paris ſuddenly lours with gloom. The next day his door is beſieged by enquiring crouds; his health is the converſation of all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. It appeared as if Scipio lay confined, and the virtuous Romans paſſed their hours in melancholy anxiety, for the life of their protector. The phyſicians find Molé in an exhauſted ſtate, and preſcribe a free uſe of wine. This preſcription is ſoon known in the circles at Paris; and Molé finds two thouſand bottles of the fineſt Burgundy ſent to his houſe from various quarters. Molé at length recovers; all Paris rejoices, and ruſhes to his benefit. Such was the public ardour, that it produced him the amazing ſum of 24,000 livres. Molé gratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the valuable tribute of their applauſe; he was in debt, and the benefit formed all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0187301600:19"/>
his fortune. How then does Molé apply his 24,000 livres? An Engliſhman would have purchaſed an annuity, or perhaps have paid his debts. Molé runs to the jeweller, takes its amount in brilliants, and gives them to his miſtreſs, who boaſts that ſhe wears all the honours of the public.</p>
            <p>This ſerves to diſplay at once the frivolity of the nation, and of the individual. All Paris is concerned for the indiſpoſition of an actor, and all terminates in giving dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds to an impudent brunette.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Hiſtories compared with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs.</note> Of the eminent perſonages in hiſtory, we have many differing characters. We know well how the object will appear when ſeen through the coloured teleſcope of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced hiſtorian. The moſt impartial may not always be ſucceſsful in his delineations. An intelligent reader frequently diſcovers <hi>traits</hi> which ſeem concealed. He does not perceive theſe faint touches in the broad canvaſs of the hiſtorian, but in thoſe little portraits which have ſometimes reached poſterity. He acquires more knowledge of indiviuals by memoirs, than by hiſtories. In hiſtories there is a majeſty, which keeps us diſtant from great men; in memoirs,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0187301600:20"/>
there is a familiarity, which invites us to approach them. In hiſtories, we appear only as one who joins the croud to ſee them paſs; in memoirs, we are like concealed ſpies, who pauſe on every little circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and note every little expreſſion.</p>
            <p>It is thus that ſuch works as Plutarch's Lives, Froiſſart's Chronicle, the Memoirs of Comines and Brantome, Burnet's and Clarendon's Hiſtories of their own Times, have ever allured curioſity, and gratified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. There are indeed readers who, when they turn over the pages of hiſtory, indulge in the marvellous of romance. A viſionary perfection darts from their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and throws around a brilliant delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Their heroes are, prince Arthurs; their Heroines, Unas; their Stateſmen, Merlins. It muſt be confeſſed, that in the mode in which hiſtory is frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, there are ſufficient reaſons to render ſuch a ſyſtem plauſible. One can hardly meet with the moſt natural event in the hiſtories of ſuch writers as Tacitus, of Strada, and of Mariana, but theſe refined writers are for deriving it from ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found policy, or intricate deception. In
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0187301600:21"/>

He writes <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'The reader of hiſtory paſſes his judgment on its heroes, not ſo much from what they ought to have done in the circumſtances in which they appear before him, as from what he concludes they might have done.

Among the various claſſes of readers, very few exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine incidents with judgment; and moſt who have abilities for this, are oftentimes very unjuſt.'</q> I add a judicious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Patin, on this ſubject. <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'The myſterious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the deſigns of princes, renders a hiſtory valuable; but it muſt be founded on truth, and not on the imagination of an hiſtorian who affects continually to make a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.'</q>
               </note>. The hiſtorian frequently ſeems ignorant of that haſte, in which the moſt ſplendid actions are performed, and diſcovers a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar plot in the irregular combinations of fortune. Every ſtateſman who comes down to us as a Neſtor, I doubt was not the ſage

            <p>I ſhall cloſe this topic with ſome anecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſketches of ſeveral monarchs, who have formed epochas in the hiſtory of their nations.</p>
            <p>We are delighted to attend Auguſtus amidſt the embarraſſing affairs of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into his domeſtic receſſes. To ſee him the preceptor of his ſon; to obſerve him at ſupper ſeated between Virgil and Horace, and to mark him with exquiſite wit eraſe one of his own tragedies. Virgil was afflicted by an aſthma, and Horace by a fiſtula lachrymalis. When Auguſtus was placed between them he uſed to ſay, not unpoetically, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'I am now between ſighs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0187301600:25"/>
and tears.'</q> This lover of the art, aſpired to become an artiſt; he wrote a tragedy called Ajax; but he had the good ſenſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that if he was born to be an emperor, he was not to be a poet. One day he effaced with his ſponge the whole tragedy; when it was enquired after, he wittily anſwered, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Ajax is dead, he has ſwallowed his ſponge;'</q> alluding to a mode of death practiſed by the Roman gladiators, who frequently in deſpair ſwallowed their ſponges. Theſe little anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes ſhew the literary diſpoſitions of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, whom perhaps (as other great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs who reſemble him) a cruel ſyſtem of politics alone had made a tyrant<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſay politics alone compelled Auguſtus to ſanguinary meaſures. We know that he would never cauſe enquiries to be made after the authors of certain papers which had been ſcattered in the ſenate, and which loaded him with calumnies. When Tiberius wondered at his indifference, this great monarch anſwered, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'You think like a young man.

When he had attained power, he ſhewed the moſt amiable diſpoſition. It is ſaid of him, in comparing the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his reign with its cloſe, it had been deſirable, that he had never been emperor, or that he had never ceaſed to be emperor. Auguſtus is an eminent example of the force of the terrible genius of politics.</note>.</p>
            <p>Louis XIV. merits the love of poſterity.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0187301600:26"/>
The genuis of his people, not his own, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with attempts inimical to the rights of mankind. When this monarch is deprived of that falſe glory which his adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have thrown around him, he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to advantage, placed in the ſofter light of thoſe hours, which he devoted to the ſociety of the great men whom his ſplendid patronage had formed. Numerous anecdotes of this monarch, are eternal teſtimonies of his intellectual powers and his fine taſte. He loved the converſations of Boileau and Racine. He was not a mere auditor of their works; he admired them with exquiſite ſenſibility, and animadverted on them with juſt criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. We know that he detected ſeveral errors in their works. The eye that could catch a Boileau and a Racine tripping, it muſt be confeſſed was of no ordinary quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Several of theſe royal converſations have been recorded. It is honourable for the ſatyrical bard, that he had the boldneſs frequently to ſpeak his ſentiments freely; and what is ſtill more honourable, his majeſty did not diſlike his frankneſs. I give the reader one or two of thoſe intereſting anecdotes, which relate to theſe two poets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0187301600:27"/>
It is well known, that when Boileau read to his Majeſty one of his epiſtles, in which are theſe fine verſes, deſcribing the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Titus, 
<q>
                  <l>'Qui rendit de ſon joug l'univers amoureux;</l>
                  <l>'Qu'on n'alla jamais voir, ſans revenir heureux;</l>
                  <l>'Qui ſoupiroit le ſoir, ſi ſa main fortunée,</l>
                  <l>'N'avoit par ſes bienfaits ſignalé la journée'—</l>
               </q> 
his Majeſty was enchanted, and made the poet repeat them thrice. At that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perhaps, he propoſed Titus for his model; ſuch was the force of poetry! The next day, he gave orders for the war; ſuch was the power of politics! When the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiric bard, for the firſt time after the death of Racine, paid his reſpects to the king, Louis received him with affection. He ſympathiſed in the loſs; and he added, in pulling out his watch, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Remember, Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau, I have an hour for you every week.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I add one more anecdote, which brings us into his apartment. When the French Auguſtus was one day confined to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he ſent for Racine. The poet read with grace; and his Majeſty aſked him to take up ſome book. A life of Plutarch was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0187301600:28"/>
The king objected, becauſe of it's old French. <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Will your Majeſty permit me to try a life?'</q> ſaid Racine. The king conſented. Our poet took down a volume of Amiot, and turned his obſolete language into a beautiful ſtyle. Louis was in rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; he roſe, and embraced the poet.</p>
            <p>It is with difficulty I can perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that Charles I. would have been a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. The Eikon Baſilike, which I conſider as the memoirs of his heart, abounds with ſuch ſtrokes of natural feeling, and ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully excites our ſympathy, that we cannot eaſily conceive how a tyrant could have aſſumed ſuch a character.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0187301600:29"/>
reports from the memorandums of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Revels, tends to prove, that even in proſperity, he would not ſuffer his people to be inſulted by the language of deſpotiſm. The following lines were in a manuſcript play of Maſſinger; 
<q>
                  <l>Monies? We'ell raiſe ſupplies <hi>what ways we pleaſe,</hi>
                  </l>

                  <l>But what their <hi>ſwords</hi> did ratify—</l>

I cannot do better than tranſcribe the words of Sir Henry Herbert. <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'I have entered this, here, for ever to bee remembered by my ſon, and thoſe that caſt their eyes on it, in honour of king Charles, my maſter,

               </q>
This anecdote, with others which might be given, and the whole of the eloquent Eikon Baſilike, ſtrongly indicate, that the inclinations of Charles were remote from tyranny. He was, indeed, firmly perſuaded, that a king had juſt powers, of which it was as neceſſary to be careful, as of the juſt rights of his people.

            <p>I conclude this topic with an anecdote of the late unfortunate Louis XVI. little known, but which forcibly characterizes the diſpoſitions of this monarch. In a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on the ſubject of Rouſſeau's works, he ſaid, that he wiſhed it were poſſible to annihilate the Emilius, on education; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in that book, the author attacks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, diſturbs the ſecurity of ſociety, and the juſt ſubordination of citizens; it can only tend to render men unhappy.—But the ſocial contract has alſo a moſt dangerous tendency, obſerved a courtier.—<q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'As for that,'</q>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0187301600:31"/>
replied this moſt excellent prince, in words which muſt not be forgotten, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'it is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.

            <p>It is impoſſible to deny, that this anecdote reveals the diſpoſitions of the monarch.

Of ſome extraordinary minds it has been ſaid, that their knowledge is attained by that ſublime conception, which ſurveys at one glance the ſpecies, and becomes as it were by intuition, familiar with the individual. A Shakeſpeare has certainly given the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible language and deſcriptions to characters and ſituations, which never paſſed under his eye. Such phenomena in nature we admire; but who would imitate? We gain our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the ſlow acceſſion of multiplied facts; theſe our reflection combines, and thus combined, they form what we call experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Rochefoucalt, when with ſuch ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic conciſeneſs, he compoſed his celebrated Maxims, had ever ſome particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or ſome particular individual, before him. When he obſerved, that, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'It diſplays a great poverty of mind, to have only one kind of genius,'</q> he drew this reflection from repeated <hi>anecdotes</hi> which he had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the perſons of Boileau and Racine<note n="*" place="bottom">See Curioſities of Literature, vol. ii. art. <hi>Poets.</hi>
               </note>. It was a very happy idea of Amelot de la Houſſaie, when he gave an edition of theſe admirable Maxims, to illuſtrate ſeveral from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0187301600:33"/>
examples, or anecdotes, drawn from hiſtory. If they were all thus illuſtrated, by well collected authorities, it would form not only a rich repaſt for amateurs of anecdotes, but impreſs more forcibly the ſolid ſenſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too cloſely compreſſed in theſe conciſe maxims<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The bulk of mankind indeed, when facts preſent themſelves to their contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, are incapable of contemplating. Ignorant of their utility, they only regard them as objects of idle amuſement. Yet the ſcience of human nature, like the ſcience of phyſics, was never perfected till vague theory was rejected for certain experiment.

An Addiſon and a Bruyere accompany their reflections by characters; an anecdote in their hand informs us better than a whole eſſay of Seneca. Opinions are fallible, but not examples.</p>
            <p>A writer elegantly declaims againſt the vanity of a poet; but when he judiciouſly gives a few of the innumerable inſtances of poetical vanity, we ſhall comprehend him with more certainty, and follow his reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the firm conviction of truth. Would he inform us, that innumerable little follies prevail in very great minds? Every opinion is diſputable. We are perſuaded of it's truth, when he reminds us, that Sir Robert Walpole, a great miniſter, was ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of being a man of gallantry; and that another great miniſter, Cardinal Richelieu, was not leſs ambitious of being diſtinguiſhed as a poet; and that the one was as aukward in his compliments, as the other in his verſes. In a word, the wiſe Elizabeth was a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette. The ambitious Charles V. termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated his career by watch-making. Racine believed himſelf to be a politician.</p>
            <p>When an author gives a character which ſtrikes by it's ſingularity, an anecdote will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0187301600:35"/>
ſerve to eſtabliſh the veracity of its exiſtence. Thus the character of the aſtronomer in Raſſelas, ſo finely deſcribed by Johnſon, is a character founded in nature. With a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſublimity of genius, this ſtudent is repreſented with an imbecillity little to be ſuſpected, that of believing himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the power of regulating the ſeaſons. A ſimilar character was this of Poſtel. His Lectures were attended by ſuch crouds, that he was obliged to harangue his auditors at a window, as the hall of the college at Paris was not ſufficiently large to contain them; yet this man, (otherwiſe ſo judicious) cheriſhed the extravagant folly of believing himſelf endowed with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural reaſon. He hoped to convert all the nations of the earth, and had ever in his mind the idea of creating an order, to be called the Knights of Chriſt; and for this purpoſe aſſociated himſelf with the jeſuits, who expelled him when they perceived his diſtempered imagination.</p>
            <p>We cannot therefore accumulate too great a number of ſuch little facts; I ſay facts, otherwiſe we may err in our deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: as, when one part of a ſum is wrong, the total amount muſt infallibly be ſo. Facts
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0187301600:36"/>
are anecdotes, but anecdotes are not always facts.</p>
            <p>It is only the complaint of unreflecting minds, that we collect too many anecdotes. Why is human knowledge imperfect, but becauſe life does not allow of ſufficient years to enable us to follow the infinity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? The man of moſt experience, ſtill finds that he has new characters to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, old opinions to confirm, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to correct, as well as to acquire.

            <p>It is curious to obſerve the firſt dawn of genius breaking on the mind. Sometimes a man of genius, in his firſt effuſions, is ſo far from revealing his future powers, that, on the contrary, no reaſonable hope can be formed of his ſucceſs. In the violent ſtruggle of his mind, he may give a wrong direction to his talents; as Swift, in two pindaric odes, which have been unfortunately preſerved in his works. Sometimes a man of genius diſplays no talents, even among thoſe who are able to decide on them; his genius, like Aeneas, is veiled by a cloud, and remains unperceived by his aſſociates. This was the caſe of Goldſmith; who was ſo far from diſplaying a fine genius, that even his literary companions, before the publication of his beautiful poems, regarded
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0187301600:39"/>
him as a compiler for the Bookſellers, not as a writer for men of taſte. Sometimes, when a writer diſplays an early genuis, it is not expreſſed with all its force. Several have began verſifiers, and concluded poets; and perhaps this is no unjuſt idea of Pope.</p>
            <p>Is a man of genius oppreſſed with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic miſeries? Does he tread on thorns, while he cultivates flowers? he ceaſes to feel his own griefs, while he contemplates thoſe of his maſters. On the misfortunes of the learned, more than one volume has been compoſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Pierius Valerianus, has given a little book, intitled, <hi>De infelicitate litteratorum,</hi> which he wrote from his own ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in which for many years he participated in the miſeries he recorded of other ſcholars. It was afterwards greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.—A collection has been publiſhed at Leipſic, in 1647, entitled <hi>Analecta de calamitate litteratorum.</hi> Several other works on this ſubject have appeared.</note>. The domeſtic perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a man of genius are more frequent, and more formidable to his ſenſibility, than thoſe of a party or of the public.

An illiterate parent, who haraſſes the mild diſpoſitions of his

philoſophic ſon, and who counts, with all the anxiety of the father and the merchant, the hours he laviſhes on his ſtudies, has been an ordinary miſery of literary men.

I haſten to conclude a liſt, which perhaps is interminable. Can we read without indignation, that the family of the great Deſcartes were inſenſible to the luſtre his ſtudies reflected on their name? They grievouſly lamented, as a blot, which could not be effaced from their arms, that Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes, who was born a <hi>gentleman,</hi> ſhould become a <hi>philoſopher!</hi> This elevated genius was even denied the ſatisfaction of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his expiring parent; while his dwarfiſh brother, whoſe mind muſt have been as diminutive as his perſon, ridiculed his philoſophic relative, and turned to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage his philoſophic diſpoſitions. The ſublime Bacon generally ſat at the end of his table in a ſtate of abſtraction, while at the other his dependants cheated, ridiculed, and loaded him with infamous aſperſions. We muſt not look into the domeſtic receſſes of men of genius, if we would conſider them as beloved or happy.</p>
            <p>The purpoſe of this Diſſertation is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, however feeble, to exhibit the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the delight of anecdote in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of any topic. I therefore ſhall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0187301600:42"/>
not wander from it, if I ſketch ſeveral ſubjects which relate to literary men, and which ſhall conſiſt of reflections, illuſtrated by anecdotes.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that Envy is only the offspring of little minds. This has been repeated from age to age; but it is one of thoſe popular prejudices which are not the leſs falſe, becauſe they are of a remote date. Of literary jealouſy, to ſelect inſtances were difficult, becauſe of their abundance. Why did Swift and Milton treat with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the rhimes of Dryden? Why did Corneille, tottering on the grave, when Racine conſulted him on his firſt tragedy, adviſe the author never to write another? Why does Voltaire continually detract from the ſublimity of Corneille, the ſweetneſs of Racine, and the fire of Crebillon? Why was the admirable La Fontaine not even mentioned by the French Horace in all his works? Why muſt poſterity lament that the name of Young is to be found in the Dunciad of Pope? Why did Boccaccio, in ſending to Petrarch a copy of Dante, make an apology for it? and why did the latter, in his anſwer, ſpeak coldly of Dante's merits?
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0187301600:43"/>
The rigid virtue of Johnſon could not ſave him from the meaneſt envy of Garrick; nor the artleſs diſpoſitions of Goldſmith from the corroſion of literary jealouſy.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to repreſs our indignation at this envy of writers, who ſhould look for that ſupport from each other, which is ſometimes unjuſtly denied them by the world. In contemplating on this ſubject, we are ſtruck with the ſame horror as if we were to look into a neſt of doves, and behold vipers hiſſing at each other.</p>
            <p>We muſt feel another kind of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which falls not upon authors, but their readers. Men of genius have complained, that their acquaintance are the laſt perſons in the world, whoſe affections they can win. I collect ſeveral teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>When the voice of the public ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the friends of a man of genius, how much he merits their affection, they will be incapable of beſtowing it. A familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with an author (obſerves Hume) may diminiſh the applauſe due to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. It was the eternal miſery of Rouſſeau, that his friends did not know how much he merited their affections. On

            <p>I purſue this ſpeculation, intereſting to literature.</p>
            <p>Of Seneca, it is obſerved in the Perro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niana, that he himſelf writes againſt pointed periods, and the epigrammatic ſtyle. Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius was extravagantly fond of a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſtyle; his epiſtles offend by a continued affection of this kind; yet he not only cenſures brevity, and declares it to produce a dry jejune mode of writing, but minutely enters into it's numerous defects. Cicero very warmly reprehends that abuſe, with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0187301600:47"/>
which the Greeks were accuſtomed to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their adverſaries; and who frequently paſſed from the cenſure of the work, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirizing the author himſelf. But Cicero has left poſterity no few ſpecimens of the abuſive ſtyle, and the groſſeſt perſonali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. While Plato inveighs againſt poetry, he proves himſelf a great poet. It is thus Mallebranche declaims againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive charms of a fine imagination, while he diſplays a moſt beautiful and deluding one.

Burnet, in the 'Hiſtory of his own Times,' which is almoſt as fabulous as Lucian's 'True Hiſtory,' is, however, (and he was a biſhop) continually appealing to God and his conſcience for the veracity of his work.

                           <l>As virgins hate, and as ſly courtiers love,</l>
                           <l>Juſt ſo may Lucian, nay, and Burnet too,</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>We are aſtoniſhed at the ſolemn appeals which our Biſhop makes to Heaven, for the veracity of his facts. I ſuppoſe moſt readers imagine that he muſt have been ſenſible that he was only calling on Heaven to ſerve as a teſtimony to ſanction lies. This, however, (to do as much juſtice as poſſible to the Biſhop) does not appear to me to be the caſe. Burnet has been called the Engliſh Varillas; and the character of the latter writer, attacked by the learned of all nations, and particularly in this country by the ingenious Dr. King, may ſerve to illuſtrate that of Burnet.</p>
                     <p>Varillas has been accuſed of quoting memoirs which never exiſted, or in which the facts he relates are not to be found. It is however very true that Varillas had read an aſtoniſhing number of original memoirs. The life of this man was conſumed in his ſtudy; and it was his boaſt, that for thirty years he had not dined from home. He had read ſo many manuſcripts, that his ſight failed, and he loſt the uſe of one eye. By candle-light he could not read; and it was his cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to cloſe his windows at duſk, and then to <hi>write</hi> his Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. But as he could not authenticate his anecdotes, by conſulting the memoirs which had been furniſhed to him from the King's Library, in which there is a collection from 8 to 10,000 Mſſ. he truſted to his memory. This naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his confuſion in facts; what belonged to one kingdom was given to a neighbouring country; what related to one perſon was transferred to another.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore poſſible to ſuppoſe that neither Varillas nor Burnet intended to impoſe on the world. But from theſe anecdotes we may inforce a very important maxim, that an Hiſtorian muſt not write as <hi>facts</hi> what he only collects from <hi>memory;</hi> he muſt authenticate his ſources, whatever they may be, by correct citations. If he does otherwiſe, he is not to be truſted; for however honeſt may be his intentions, it is certain that he will not only impoſe on his reader, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on himſelf. Let it alſo be remembered, that he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on his memory, is frequently the dupe of his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p>If I were to make the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would accompany it with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anecdotes.</p>
            <p>A man of genius conſumes one portion of his life in painful ſtudies; another in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his labours to the public, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating with his rivals; in the laſt inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable remnant of life, he perhaps begins to enjoy that public eſteem for which he had ſacrificed the ſolid conſolations of life, his fortune, his tranquillity, in a word, his domeſtic Lares. Amidſt the funereal cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs he ſees the green leaves of the laurel. He reſembles a veteran ſoldier, who ſhould, at the moment he is carried from the trenches in an expiring ſtate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the honours of promotion. When he is once removed from the public and his rivals, there is nothing they refuſe him.</p>
            <p>Every little thing that belonged to this man
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0187301600:53"/>
of genius becomes an invaluable relic. The living Shakeſpeare experienced little of that adoration which has been repeatedly paid to him by poſterity. Little did he imagine that the <hi>Mulberry Tree</hi> which he planted (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he did plant it) would have been ſought after with as much eagerneſs as a pious Catholic ſhews for a piece of the real croſs. Thomſon never imagined that his <hi>old chair</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In a feſtival in honour of the Poet of the Seaſons, the chair in which it is ſuppoſed he compoſed part of his Seaſons, was produced, and communicated a poetic rapture to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of the Muſe, aſſembled for this occaſion. Even honeſt Aubrey can admire the <hi>chair</hi> of a man of genius. Our anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary ſays of Ben Jonſon, in the curious manuſcript which Mr. Malone has given in his account of the Engliſh Stage, I <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'have ſeen his ſtudyeing chaire which was of ſtrawe, ſuch as old women uſed; and as Aulus Gellius is drawn in.'</q> Aubrey ſhould himſelf have had ſuch <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'a ſtudyeing chaire,'</q> for he was <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'an old woman.'</q>
               </note> would have been beheld with the eyes of adoration by his countrymen. Rabelais, among all his drolleſt imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, never conceived that his <hi>cloak</hi> would be preſerved in the univerſity of Montpellier, that thoſe who are received as doctors ſhould wear it on the day they take their degree.</p>
            <p>Such is the public! long miſled by the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0187301600:54"/>
malice of rivals, their deciſions are capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, irreſolute, and unjuſt. Poſterity, while it cenſures the paſt age, commits the ſame injuſtice to its cotemporaries. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſts its admiration on an old tree, an old chair, and an old cloak, while the modern Shakeſpeares, Thomſons, and Rabelais (if there ſhould be any) would paſs unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by its injudicious applauſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add one more ſketch of a literary topic.</p>
            <p>Men of genius catch inſpiration from that of others. Their mind is not always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to pour forth its burning ideas; it is kindled by the flame which it ſtrikes from the colliſion of the works of great writers. It was thus that Cicero informs us that he animated his eloquence by a conſtant peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the poetry of the Latins and Greeks. Poets awaken their imagination by the verſes of other poets. Malherbe, Corneille, and Racine, before they applied themſelves to compoſition, put their mind into its proper tone, by repeating the glowing paſſages of their favourite poets. The moſt fervid verſes of Homer, and the ſweeteſt of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0187301600:55"/>
Euripides, enriched the memory of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Milton,'</q> (ſays Richardſon) <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'had read and ſtudied all the greateſt Poets, and had made all his own; Homer he could almoſt repeat without book.'</q>
               </note>. It is related of Boſſuet, that before he compoſed a funeral oration, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to withdraw for four or five days into his ſtudy, and read Homer. When he was aſked the reaſon of this practice, he expreſſed himſelf in theſe verſes, 
<q>
                  <l>—Magnam mihi mentem, animumque,</l>
                  <l>Delius inſpirat vates—</l>
               </q> 
Marville ſays, that the famous orators in the pulpit and at the bar, of his time, uſed to read the fineſt paſſages of the poets, to germinate thoſe ſeeds of eloquence which nature had ſcattered in their ſouls. It was thus alſo, that a celebrated preacher boldly copied Seneca, the tragedian, in the violent paſſions he aſſumed; and one leſs ardent, but more tender, interwove in his ſermons pieces taken from Ovid. One pleader would only breathe the fury of Juvenal; another diſplayed the graceful turns which he had borrowed from Horace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0187301600:56"/>
               <note place="margin">Collections of anecdotes ſerve as an excellent ſubſtitute for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of eminent writers.</note> We now turn to the conſideration of thoſe literary collections which give the anecdotes and converſations of celebrated men.</p>
            <p>The converſations of ſcholars have been collected in ages of literature. That they have not been formed with that care, and that ſelection they merited, has been the only cauſe of their having fallen into diſrepute. With ſuch ſubſtitutes we are enabled, in no ordinary degree, to realiſe the ſociety of thoſe who are no more; and to become more real cotemporaries with the great men of another age, than were even their cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries themſelves.</p>
            <p>Are we not all deſirous of joining the ſociety of eminent men? It is a wiſh of even the illiterate. But the ſenſibility of genius ſhrinks tremblingly from the contact of the vulgar, and the arrogance of learning will not deſcend to their level. They prefer a contemplative ſilence, rather than incur the chance of being inſulted by their admiration.</p>
            <p>Few therefore can be admitted to their converſations. Yet when a man of genius diſplays converſible talents, his converſations are frequently more animated, more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatile,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0187301600:57"/>
and, I muſt add, more genuine than his compoſitions. Such literary converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be compared to waters which flow from their ſource; but literary writings reſemble more frequently an ornamented fountain, whoſe waters are forced to elevate themſelves in artificial irregularities, and ſparkling tortuoſities.</p>
            <p>Theſe collections are productive of utility. A man of letters learns from a little conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation which has been fortuitouſly preſerved; a caſual hint which was gathered as it fell; and an obſervation which its author might never have an occaſion to inſert in his works, numberleſs myſteries in the art of literary compoſition; and thoſe minute cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which familiarize us to the genius of one whom we admire, and whom ſometimes we aſpire to imitate.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſervations on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary hiſtory.</note> Literary hiſtory has indeed been purſued with a paſſionate fondneſs by our firſt ſcholars. I will not wander from home on this occaſion, though our neighbours far ſurpaſs us in this pleaſing ſpecies of erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Dr. Johnſon has ſaid, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'It was what he moſt loved.'</q> It is curious to obſerve, that he begins his Biography of our Poets,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0187301600:58"/>
by a complaint of <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'the penury of Engliſh biography.'</q> It is the regret of one who felt all it's charms, and who perhaps lamented that he could not much improve its miſerable fund. Dr. Warburton has called literary hiſtory, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'the moſt agreeable ſubject in the world.'</q> Dr. Warton, in his Eſſay on the Genius of Pope, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented us with an admirable ſpecimen in what manner literary anecdote may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced for the illuſtration of an author, and delight of the reader. Peliſſon, in his Hiſtory of the French Academy, has made an obſervation on literary hiſtory, which will find an echo in the boſom of every man of letters. He writes, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Had we any particulars remaining of what paſſed between Auguſtus, Mecenas, and the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated wits of their age, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhould read this hiſtory with leſs curioſity and delight than that of the wars, and affairs of the government of thoſe times. Perhaps (to ſay ſomething more) we ſhould not read it with leſs utility and inſtruction: we, I ſay, to whom Fortune has given, nor armies to conduct, nor politics to govern; but to whom ſhe has
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0187301600:59"/>
only bequeathed ſtudy, converſation, and the domeſtic virtues.'</q> Literary anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes carry with them ſo powerful an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, that we conſult with pleaſure the Athenae Oxonienſes of Anthony Wood, though compoſed in a hard, dry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive ſtyle. Another work of a congenial caſt, is Hawkins's Life of Johnſon, whoſe genius revived that of the ſour Wood. Mr. Nichols, in his Life of Bowyer, has made a moſt valuable acceſſion of cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary anecdote; perhaps a happier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, and a more copious criticiſm, are deſireable. Mr. Boſwell, in his Life of Johnſon, has exquiſitely gratified the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teur of literary anecdotes. To compare it with Monnoye's edition of the Menagiana, would not be doing juſtice to this work, which is almoſt as ſingular in it's nature, as it's merit. It is with pleaſure that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of late, that ſeveral writers of taſte have not conſidered it as beneath their powers to become commentators. Mr. T. Warton, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Malone, and Dr. Farmer, ſtand eminently diſtinguiſhed in this claſs of literature, which has hitherto been aſſigned to writers of low talents.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0187301600:60"/>
Theſe critics have felt all the charms of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary hiſtory; and their curious reſearches intereſt us much more by the pleaſure we feel in their peruſal, than by that recondite erudition in Engliſh literature, which they ſo admirably diſplay<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Pope, whoſe criticiſm is almoſt ever unerring, miſerably failed when he ſatirized thoſe who applied to the forgotten vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of our old authors, to elucidate the writings and manners of another age. Attached to the claſſics of Greece and Rome, he perhaps did not recollect that there is a time in the literature of every poliſhed nation, when it has claſſics of it's own. There is a bigotry in literature, as well as in religion. So ignorant was Pope of our old Engliſh writers, that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented he had not been acquainted with the ſatires of Biſhop Hall, when he devoted his muſe to ſatirical compoſition. How many other authors are there, on whoſe ſoil his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry would have gleaned many a rich ſheaf! Had he known more of theſe writers, he would have hardly ventured to commit depredations on Milton.</p>
                  <p>We are not, therefore, any more to be told of,

He ſays, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'In criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing upon Milton, Jonſon and Spenſer, and ſome other of our elder poets, not only a competent knowledge of all ancient claſſical learning is requiſite, but alſo an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with thoſe books, which, though now forgotten and loſt, were yet in repute about the time in which each author reſpectively wrote, and which it is moſt likely he had read.'</q>

He did better. He took £.500 for his Life, and never wrote a page of it. By the way, this has been no uncommon practice among authors. Some have publiſhed a variety of titles of works, as if they were ready for the preſs; but of which the titles only had been written. Pafchal, who was hiſtoriographer to Francis I. forged ſuch titles, that the penſion which he received for occupying himſelf on the French hiſtory might be continued. When he died, all his hiſtorical performances did not exceed ſix pages!</note>. What
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0187301600:62"/>
is the conſequence of ſuch idle biography? With much trouble we find, at length, that the genius of either remains yet to be known. One poet is made to reſemble another; and, what is worſe, a poet reſembles a lord chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor. Richardſon, a Miltonic enthuſiaſt, was beſt qualified to give the biography of Milton an enthuſiaſt. He did not remain ſatisfied with collecting the information which induſtrious enquiry produced, but he ſtudied to give the character of Milton from his own deſcriptions. He connected, with an ardour of reſearch, for which poſterity ſhould be grateful, from all his works, in verſe and in proſe, the minute circumſtances, and peculiar ſentiments, which our ſublime poet had recorded of himſelf.</p>
            <p>In reading this ſketch of the manners, and the genius, of Milton, we ſeem to live with him; we participate in the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary griefs which afflicted him, and the momentary triumphs in which he exulted. We join the old blind bard at the door of his houſe, near Bunhill-fields<note n="*" place="bottom">Moſt of the following particulars are given in the lively expreſſions of Richardſon.</note>; we ſee him ſit there in a grey coarſe cloth coat, in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0187301600:63"/>
warm ſunny weather, breathing the freſh air. His houſe is, indeed, ſmall, (and what true poet ever poſſeſſed a large one?) It has but one room on a floor. Up one pair of ſtairs, hung in ruſty green, ſits John Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in an elbow chair, in black clothes, yet neat enough. Pale, but not cadaverous; his hands gouty.</p>
            <p>And what does Milton ſay on his blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when his enemies reproach him with it as a crime? Theſe are his words, taken from his ſecond defence of the Engliſh nation: <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'I prefer my blindneſs to your's,'</q> (he addreſſes his adverſaries) <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'your's is ſunk into your deepeſt ſenſes, blinding your minds, ſo that you can ſee nothing that is ſound and ſolid. Mine takes from me only the colour and ſurface of things, but does not take away from the mind's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, what is in thoſe things of true and conſtant. Moreover, how many things are there which I would not ſee! How many which I can be debarred the ſight without repining! How few left which I much deſire to ſee! Vile men! who mock us! The blind have a protection from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of men, and we are rendered almoſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0187301600:64"/>
ſacred. To this I impute, that my friends are more ready and officious to ſerve me than before, and more frequently viſit me. They do not think that the only worth of an honeſt man is placed in his eyes.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Richardſon would have conſidered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as fortunate, had he been enabled to add another lively ſcene to the domeſtic life of Milton. This has been obtained by the late laureat, who, in his ſecond edition of his juvenile poems, has given the nuncupative will of our poet. I gather from a maſs of the barren ſuperfluities of legal information, thoſe intereſting ſtrokes with which every man of ſenſibility and taſte will ſympathize. We muſt recollect, that at the period to which they relate, Milton was no more the ſecretary of the commonwealth, and his friends were deſtroyed or diſperſed. Theſe little facts deſcribe more forcibly than the moſt eloquent declamation, thoſe ſecret miſeries which preyed on the heart of Milton, and which muſt not only have diſturbed his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime contemplations, but impeded the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his fancy, and the corrections of his criticiſm.</p>
            <p>It is here we learn that his children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined to cheat and to rob him; to embitter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0187301600:65"/>
his hours with ſcorn and diſaffection; and far from ſolacing the age of their venerable, their ſublime parent, they became impatient of his death. He had

The name of Milton muſt be added to the melancholy catalogue of the unhappy learned. Behold the great Milton, blind, decrepid, poor, and ſolitary (for ſolitary he muſt then have been amidſt thoſe who now ſurrounded him) ſeated by a little fire in his kitchen, crying to his wife, with a voice of patient grief, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Make much of me as long as I live.'</q>—When his meat is brought to him, becauſe it is made agreeable to his taſte (for he was delicate though temperate) he exclaims with grateful pleaſure to his wife, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'God have mercy, Betty, I ſee thou wilt perform according to thy promiſe, in providing me ſuch diſhes as I think fit, whilſt I live.'</q>—Such is our own domeſtic language, and ſuch was the domeſtic language of the ſublimeſt genius. Genius is not above the little conſolations of humanity.</p>
            <p>Let me reflect a moment on the ſcene that occupies my imagination. Men of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0187301600:66"/>
genius! the reflection is addreſſed to you. Milton had perhaps wandered in the fields of fancy, and conſoled his blindneſs with liſtening to the voice of his nation, that was to have reſounded with his name. To Virgil, and Taſſo, and Arioſto, not his maſters but his rivals, their country had not been ungrateful. One had baſked in the ſunſhine of a court; the other had ſeen the laurel wreath prepared for him at Rome; and the laſt lived to hear his name repeated in the ſtreets, and ſaluted as the poet of his nation. Milton had enriched his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional poetry with two epics—what were his rewards? Milton conſidered himſelf as fortunate in having one female who did not entirely abandon him; and one obſcure fanatic, who was pleaſed with his poems becauſe they were religious. What laurels! What felicities!

            <p>To folace mental fatigue by the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of fancy, is no loſs of time. Students know how often the eye is buſied in wandering over the page, while the mind lies in torpid inactivity; they therefore compute their time, not by the hours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in ſtudy, but by the real acquiſitions they obtain; they do not number the voyages they make, but the gold and the diamonds they bring home. A man of letters beſt feels the truth of the maxim of Heſiod when applied to time, that <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Half is better than the whole.'</q> But it is a complaint of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious minds, that when they deviate into the gardens of Armida, they want the fortitude of Rogero to exile themſelves from their enchantments.

It is perhaps more deſireable to have ſuch literary collections at hand. Anecdotes gratify the eaſe of indolence by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs, and the love of novelty by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety which they preſent to the mind. Perhaps the intereſt they excite is ſuperior to that we feel in a work of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. It muſt be felt ſo at leaſt by the enthuſiaſtic votary, who approaches his maſters with anxiety, with curioſity, with admiration.</p>
            <p>What painter but muſt receive an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite gratification in this anecdote of Pouſſin? <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'I ſaw Pouſſin (ſays Marville) during my reſidence at Rome. I have frequently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the exceſſive love this excellent painter had for the perfection of his art. Old as he then was, I have met him among the ruins of ancient Rome, and ſometimes in the country, and on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Tiber, ſketching whatever he remarked the moſt to his taſte. I have ſeen him frequently return with his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief full of ſtones, moſs, flowers, and ſimilar objects, which he was deſirous of painting exactly after nature. I aſked him one day by what means he had attained
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0187301600:70"/>
that high excellence which had placed him ſo eminently among the Italian painters; he anſwered modeſtly, <hi>I have neglected nothing.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>And what poet is not intereſted in this literary anecdote of a kindred nature, which Johnſon has recorded of Pope? I do not venture to change his expreſſions: <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'From his attention to poetry he was never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. If converſation offered any thing that could be improved, he committed it to paper. If a thought, or perhaps an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion more happy than was common, roſe to his mind, he was careful to write it; an independant diſtich was preſerved, for an opportunity of inſertion; and ſome little fragments have been found contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lines, or parts of lines, to be wrought upon at ſome other time.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe anecdotes I conclude, that a ſtudent muſt be more intereſted in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to a Pouſſin and a Pope, than to a Sir Charles Grandiſon and a Tom Jones. Such notices as the above, relating to illuſtrious characters, are ſo many incidents in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous romance of life; and when ſuch names are mentioned, they are ſufficient to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0187301600:69"/>
excite that anxious curioſity which is the perfection of fiction. Inſtead of one hero, we have thus a thouſand, in whoſe cauſe we equally participate.</p>
            <p>Let us alſo reflect, that though ſuch anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes form a ſource of literary amuſement, they convey at the ſame time ſome of it's moſt valuable inſtructions. We learn from theſe anecdotes of Pouſſin and of Pope, that a painter muſt bring home moſs and flowers, and a poet ſentiments and images. There is nothing ſo minute, that may be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; nothing ſo vaſt but which may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape; we muſt therefore habituate our mind to ſtudious attention, as much out of our cabinet, as in it. The painter does not always require his eaſel to paint, nor the poet his poem to compoſe; their genius accompanies them in their walks, and in their converſations.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0187301600:71"/>
neglected for their deficiency in that art of finiſhing, which is the excellence of art. An artiſt has many artifices to employ, of which, if he is ignorant, he will never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that rank which he otherwiſe would merit. It is not probable that the zeal of his friends, nor even the malice of his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, will be capable of diſcovering to him thoſe myſteries of which he is ignorant, or thoſe failings which render his attempts fruitleſs. Such arts of compoſition are alone to be attained by patient meditation on his own, and on the labours of others. It will be impoſſible for him to turn over a ſeries of anecdotes, ſkilfully arranged, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by reflections, but he will gain ſome valuable intelligence which relates to his own ſtudies. From one, he learns in what manner he corrected, and he planned; from another in what manner he overcame thoſe obſtacles, which perhaps at that very moment obſtructed his progreſs, and made him riſe in deſpair from his own unfiniſhed labour. What perhaps he had in vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired for half his life, is revealed to him by an anecdote. It is thus that the recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of indolence may impart the vigour of

From this excellent writer I am informed that Dante was much given to muſing, and inclined to melancholy; that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like pride in his nature; ſilent in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary company, but when he ſpoke every word was deeply thought.

The licentious writer of the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proſe in Italian literature, had neither the ſublime melancholy of Dante, nor the enchanting politeneſs of Petrarch. In the travels which, in his youthful years, he made in the character of a merchant, he had acquired his variety of knowledge of human nature, and a decided taſte for that freedom of gaiety, which does not always ſpare the bluſhes of the modeſt, and the tremors of the pious. Love, good eating, and polite literature, were his divinities. He was big and corpulent, an able drinker, an excellent companion, and an adorer of the ladies. The prieſts, at length, frightened poor Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacio, as they afterwards did his happy diſciple La Fontaine. Boccacio ſuddenly became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſolitary, and melancholy; his ſtudies
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0187301600:79"/>
partook of his diſpoſitions, for, after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, (Tiraboſchi ſays) he produced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we can read. One is inclined to lament that he became religious.</p>
            <p>It is not amiſs, when one reads the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanthropic works of Hobbes, to recollect, that the philoſopher of Malmeſbury wrote many of them in a manner which, perhaps, has rendered them ſo rugged. We are told, that ſoon after dinner he would retire into his ſtudy, and have his candle, with ten or twelve pipes, placed by him; then ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the door, he began ſmoaking, thinking, and writing. From a man who would ſmoke at his writings ten pipes, it was but natural they ſhould retain ſomething of the dull effluvia of the tobacco. Such an one might be a philoſophic politician, but not a poetic philanthropiſt.</p>
            <p>Yet let it not be conſidered, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſenſible I may appear to the charms of ſtriking anecdotes, I do not perceive that frequently they are frivolous, inſipid, and inconſequential. Many collectors of anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes have ſhewn, by their inability, that ſome talents are requiſite, to render them valuable; ſome taſte in their ſelection,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0187301600:80"/>
ſome judgment in their arrangement, and ſome elegance in their ſtyle. <note place="margin">A writer of talents ſees relations in anecdotes not perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others.</note> A man of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration ſees relations in anecdotes, which are not immediately perceived by others; in his hands anecdotes (even ſhould they be familiar to us) are made ſuſceptible of a thouſand novel turns. We have only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Eloges of the French academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, compoſed by Fontenelle and D'Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, to perceive in what manner literary anecdotes ſhould be preſented, and to moſt of our writers to ſee how they ſhould not be given.</p>

               <note place="margin">A model of anecdotical compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> As the deſign of this Eſſay is to ſhew in what manner any topic may be enforced, or illuſtrated, by anecdotes, (rather than the manner in which any ſingle anecdote may be given) I prefer to offer, as a model of this ſpecies of anecdotical compoſition, ſome parts of the Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting, by Du Bos. This work is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly known to, and ardently cheriſhed by every man of taſte, ſo that I ſhall not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to dwell longer on it than is neceſſary to communicate my idea. When this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious reflector would eſtabliſh the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0187301600:81"/>
that <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'the impulſe of genius deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines thoſe who were born with it, to become a painter or poet,'</q> he ſhews, by a ſeries of connected anecdotes, that moſt of the celebrated artiſts were never born the ſons of painters<note n="*" place="bottom">Raphael, obſerves Du Bos, is the only exception.</note>. As for poets, they are ſtill a more ſtriking teſtimony of this impulſe of genius. No father ever yet deſigned his ſon to aſſume the profeſſion of a poet. We cannot doubt of the truth of theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when we read that variety of anecdotes which he has united with ſuch taſte, and which eſtabliſh the great principle of the impulſe of genius. There are other ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this delightful work, which charm and inſtruct us by the happy manner in which he has interwoven among his reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a ſeries of intereſting anecdotes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Of frivolous anecdotes.</note> I haſten now to conclude this Eſſay, by noticing, when anecdotes become frivolous and impertinent given by writers deſtitute of talents.</p>
            <p>Dr. Johnſon, who has devoted one of his periodical papers to a defence of anecdotes (ſome part of which has been properly quoted by Mr. Boſwell) expreſſes himſelf
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0187301600:82"/>
thus, on certain collectors of anecdotes: <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'They are not always ſo happy as to ſelect the moſt important. I know not well what advantage poſterity can receive from the only circumſtance by which Tickell has diſtinguiſhed <hi>Addiſon</hi> from the reſt of mankind, the <hi>irregularity of his pulſe;</hi> nor can I think myſelf overpaid for the time ſpent in reading the life of <hi>Malherbe,</hi> by being enabled to relate, after the learned biographer, that Malherbe had two predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant opinions; one, that the looſeneſs of a ſingle woman might deſtroy all her boaſt of ancient deſcent; the other, that the French beggars made uſe, very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and barbarouſly, of the phraſe <hi>noble gentleman,</hi> becauſe either word included the ſenſe of both.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe juſt obſervations may, perhaps, be further illuſtrated by the following notices. An admirable writer of anecdotes (whom I ſhall not name on this occaſion) has informed the world, that <hi>many of our poets have been handſome.</hi> This, certainly, neither concerns the world nor their poetry. It is trifling to tell us, that Dr. Johnſon was accuſtomed <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'<hi>to cut his nails to the quick.</hi>'</q> It is, perhaps, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0187301600:83"/>
becauſe Mr. Boſwell, who gives this intelligence, muſt feel an intereſt in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteſt circumſtance which related to him. I am not much gratified by being informed, that Menage wore <hi>a greater number of ſtockings</hi> than any other perſon, excepting one, whoſe name I have really forgotten. The biographer of Cujas, a celebrated law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, ſays, that <hi>two things</hi> were <hi>remarkable</hi> of this <hi>ſcholar.</hi> The <hi>firſt,</hi> that he ſtudied on the floor, lying on his belly on a carpet, with his books about him; and, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that his perſpiration exhaled an agreeable ſmell, which he uſed to inform his friends he had in common with Alexander the Great! This admirable biographer ſhould have told us, if he frequently turned from his very uneaſy attitude. Somebody informs us, that Guy Patin reſembled Cicero, whoſe ſtatue is preſerved at Rome; on which he enters into a compariſon of Patin with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero. He ſhould have recollected, that he might have reſembled the <hi>ſtatue</hi> of Cicero, but not Cicero himſelf. Baillet loads his life of Deſcartes with a thouſand minutiae, which leſs diſgrace the philoſopher than the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0187301600:84"/>
biographer. Was it worth while informing the public, that Deſcartes was very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular about his wigs; that he had them manufactured at Paris; and that he always kept four? That he wore green taffety in France; but that, in Holland, he quitted taffety for cloth; and that he was fond of omelets of eggs? There are writers who cannot diſtinguiſh between ſuch frivolous particulars, and thoſe anecdotes which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ſome ſtriking ſentiment, characteriſtic of a ſublime genius. It muſt alſo be confeſſed, that there are readers, who, when they meet with intereſting anecdotes of illuſtrious men, rank them with ſuch frivolous particulars.</p>

It is certainly ſafeſt, for <hi>ſome</hi> writers, to give us all they know, than to permit themſelves the power of rejection; becauſe, for this, there requires a certain degree of taſte and diſcernment, which many biographers are not ſo fortunate as to poſſeſs. Let us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times recollect, that the page over which we toil, will probably furniſh materials for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of happier talents. I would rather
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0187301600:85"/>
have a Birch, or a Hawkins, appear heavy, cold, and prolix, than that any thing which concerns a Tillotſon or a Johnſon ſhould be loſt. It muſt alſo be confeſſed, that an anecdote, or a circumſtance, which may appear inconſequential to a reader, may bear ſome remote or latent connection, which a mature reflection often diſcovers. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a biographer, who has long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the character he records, ſees many relations which eſcape an ordinary reader. On this ſubject I ſhall quote the judicious obſervation of Dr. Kippis; a writer to whom Engliſh literature owes much, and whoſe life is precious to every man of letters. Our biographer, in cloſing the life of Dr. Birch, has formed an apology for that minute reſearch, which, it is ſaid, this writer has carried to a blameable exceſs. He writes, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'It may be alledged in our author's favour, that a man who has a deep and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive acquaintance with a ſubject, often ſees a connection and importance in ſome ſmaller circumſtances, which may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be diſcerned by others; and, on that account, may have reaſons for inſerting

Perhaps it was unfortunate for our abbé, that his predeceſſor Fontenelle ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the ſame career. In a letter which he wrote ſome time after his work was publiſhed, he gives his opinion on theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutiae of literary hiſtory. He ſays, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'For my part, I ſhould be charmed if we had a good life of Homer, of Plato, of Horace, of Virgil, and their equals. It is in theſe caſes the minuteſt details would not fail to intereſt me; but I would not give a ſtraw to know the year of Rome in which Bavius was born, who were his father, his mother, his nurſe, and his preceptor; the number of his brothers and ſiſters, nor the year and the day in which he died.'</q> I muſt confeſs, in cloſing this note, that a warm admirer of any great man never finds any thing unintereſting which relates to him; but ſome biographers do not recollect, that the lives they record are not always thoſe which enjoy this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</note>.'</q>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Character of a writer of anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes.</note> I ſhall now cloſe this Diſſertation, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſketch the character of a writer of anecdotes.</p>
            <p>To collect anecdotes, is the humble la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of induſtry; but not to preſent them with reflection, with acumen, and with taſte.</p>
            <p>It is a taſk, not unworthy of genius, to arrange theſe minute notices of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0187301600:87"/>
and of human learning. A writer might yet delight us, by a collection of topics which ſhould illuſtrate manners, hiſtory, and literature: his talents muſt be verſatile, yet powerful. A writer of anecdotes has difficulties to encounter, from which the biographer is exempt. A biographer has but the peculiarities of an individual to ſeize; he has only to aſſimilate his genius to that of another perſon. He plays but with one ball, and practice will teach his hand to graſp it with adroitneſs: a writer of anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes throws with ſeveral. It becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſuch an one to render himſelf familiar with the multiform ſhapes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture herſelf. Is ſuch a writer to give anecdotes of a Gray, a Milton, or a Sterne? his ſoul muſt be ſoftened with the querulous melancholy of Gray; auſtere with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican fierceneſs of Milton; and varied with the gaiety and the pathos of Sterne. Anecdotes are but ſqualid ſkeletons, unleſs they are full of the blood and fleſh of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. If our writer does not feel with the ſenſibility of taſte, his reflections may be juſt, but trivial; his ſtyle muſt be diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified by the variety of paſſion; he muſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0187301600:88"/>
know to mourn and to rejoice. Does he preſent the anecdotes of war, of perſecution, of ſuperſtition—his periods muſt aſſume a higher tone; his ſentiments muſt overflow his facts; and his heart muſt be more occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied than his memory. Does he give the anecdotes of conviviality, of wit, and of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm—his ſtyle muſt be ſharp with epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatic pungency, or embelliſhed with a thouſand graces<note n="*" place="bottom">This art is what has been ſo juſtly admired in Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle's <hi>Eloges</hi> of the Academicians. Every one is treated in a ſtyle conformable to the object in which he excelled. The genius of Fontenelle diſcloſes that of an aſtronomer, a phyſician, a moraliſt, a geometrician, and a poet, as if either of theſe profeſſions had formed the ſtudies of his life.</note>. He is no inferior artiſt who muſt occaſionally alarm with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying ſublimity of an Angelo, or enchant with the ſoftened beauty of an Albano.</p>
            <p>A writer of anecdotes ſhould write of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent characters, as they would themſelves have written of others. He muſt therefore poſſeſs a portion of that genius which he records.</p>
            <p>If I have not raiſed the character of ſuch an author to an unneceſſary and imaginary perfection, our writers of anecdotes have yet an excellence to attain. </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0187301600:89"/>
That cannot be imaginary, which has been already effected; nor unneceſſary, which adds new gratifications to a refined taſte. I have already mentioned, as models in the art of anecdotical compoſition, the illuſtrious names of Fontenelle, D'Alembert, and Du Bos. I have been compelled, on this occaſion, to cite the literature of a rival nation. Yet, if our writers of anecdotes could unite the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious learning of Dr. Warton to his fine taſte, his exact judgment, and his exquiſite art of introducing anecdote, we perhaps might have writers who were worthy of being claſſed in the rank of the Fontenelles.</p>
