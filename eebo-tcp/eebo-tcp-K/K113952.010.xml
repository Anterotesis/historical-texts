            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>FABLE I. THE RIVER WITH A PETITION.</head>
               <l>ACcording to the Romiſh creed,</l>
               <l>I ſpeak of Rome two thouſand years ago,</l>
               <l>The life that they ſuppos'd the Gods to lead,</l>
               <l>You would not chuſe to undergo.</l>
               <l>Jupiter's buſineſs, day and night,</l>
               <l>Was to attend with open ears and eyes,</l>
               <l>And to write down, as faſt as he could write,</l>
               <l>All the impertinence that men deviſe.</l>
               <l>Beſides mens fopperies and ravings,</l>
               <l>The women had ſo great a ſhare,</l>
               <l>That their abſurdities and cravings</l>
               <l>Omnipotence alone could bear.</l>
               <l>And furthermore, to try his patience,</l>
               <l>He heard the prayers and fanciful diſtreſſes</l>
               <l>Of all his children and relations,</l>
               <l>And of his wife and his miſ-treſſes.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0579800310:20"/>Once on a time, if you'll believe tradition,</l>
               <l>A river in great tribulation,</l>
               <l>To Jupiter preſented a petition,</l>
               <l>With an expoſtulating exhortation;</l>
               <l>Whereby, if the petitioner's refus'd,</l>
               <l>He has a right to think himſelf ill-us'd;</l>
               <l>A form of prayer contriv'd for execution,</l>
               <l>Exactly like a double-barrell'd gun,</l>
               <l>Which if you fire with reſolution,</l>
               <l>You have another chance when one is done,</l>
               <l>So far from killing two birds with one ſtone,</l>
               <l>An art that's very little known;</l>
               <l>All the petitioner deſir'd to do,</l>
               <l>Was to kill one with two.</l>
               <l>Now this petition ſhew'd how the petitioner,</l>
               <l>For his fidelity, zeal, and devotion,</l>
               <l>Had been appointed a commiſſioner</l>
               <l>Of the revenues of the Ocean,</l>
               <l>Which he collected with great pains,</l>
               <l>And ſent in good and current caſh,</l>
               <l>But, for his trouble and clear gains,</l>
               <l>The Sea return'd adulterated traſh:</l>
               <l>Wherefore he pray'd,</l>
               <l>Exhorted and ſubmitted,</l>
               <l>That all the ſums the Ocean paid,</l>
               <l>Shall for the future be remitted,</l>
               <l>And iſſued fair,</l>
               <l>Without debaſement or impair.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0579800310:21"/>Ungrateful Thames! the God replied,</l>
               <l>Without that mixture and alloy,</l>
               <l>Which the Sea pours into thee every tide,</l>
               <l>Thy beauty and thy ſtrength would wear away.</l>
               <l>Without his aid thou wouldſt remain</l>
               <l>Like Tiber, or the poor pretending Seine,</l>
               <l>Led thro' parterres, or rolled down a caſcade,</l>
               <l>Confin'd to vanity, and loſt to trade.</l>
               <l>'Tis thus the Highlander complains,</l>
               <l>'Tis thus the Union they abuſe</l>
               <l>For binding their back-ſides in chains,</l>
               <l>And ſhackling their feet in ſhoes:</l>
               <l>For giving them both food and fewel,</l>
               <l>And comfortable cloaths,</l>
               <l>Inſtead of cruel oat-meal gruel;</l>
               <l>Inſtead of rags and heritable blows.</l>
               <l>Luxury every day grows ſtronger;</l>
               <l>The Highland fair</l>
               <l>Beholds her lover now no longer</l>
               <l>Trotting with his buttocks bare.</l>
               <l>Thus Doctor Brown was taken with the ſpleen,</l>
               <l>And fancied we were all undone,</l>
               <l>Raving about a carpet and a ſcreen,</l>
               <l>And out of temper with the ſun:</l>
               <l>Becauſe it is a crime,</l>
               <l>As he ſuppoſes,</l>
               <l>For men to run in winter time</l>
               <l>Into the ſun to warm their noſes.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0579800310:22"/>'Tis an egregious want of ſenſe,</l>
               <l>A want of taſte, and want of ſhame,</l>
               <l>To fancy univerſal affluence</l>
               <l>And luxury the ſame.</l>
               <l>In ſpite of Doctor Brown's diſcerning,</l>
               <l>The term of univerſal will agree,</l>
               <l>As well with his benevolence and learning,</l>
               <l>As univerſal ſuit with luxury.</l>
               <l>He may perceive, if he be ſo inclin'd,</l>
               <l>Like his diſcernment, luxury's confin'd.</l>
               <l>For as the gout torments the hands and feet,</l>
               <l>To eaſe the nobler ſtomach and the head,</l>
               <l>So luxury, to gratify the great,</l>
               <l>Inſults and robs the labourer of his bread.</l>
               <l>Luxury in a ſtate is a diſeaſe,</l>
               <l>Becauſe 'tis partial, and obſtructed wealth,</l>
               <l>But univerſal affluence and eaſe</l>
               <l>Is univerſal happineſs and health.</l>

               <l>No earthly bird was worthy of her love;</l>

               <l>HEalth from the bard who loves the rural ſport,</l>
               <l>To the more noble bard that haunts the court:</l>
               <l>In every other point of life we chime,</l>
               <l>Like two ſoft lines when coupled into rhyme.</l>
               <l>I praiſe a ſpacious villa to the ſky,</l>
               <l>You a cloſe garret full five ſtories high;</l>
               <l>I revel here in Nature's varied ſweets,</l>
               <l>You in the nobler ſcents of London ſtreets.</l>
               <l>I left the court, and here, at eaſe reclin'd,</l>
               <l>Am happier than the king who ſtay'd behind:</l>
               <l>Twelve ſtifling diſhes I could ſcarce live o'er,</l>
               <l>At home I dine with luxury on four.</l>
               <l>Where would a man of judgment chuſe a ſeat,</l>

               <l>Does not the variegated marble yield</l>
               <l>To the gay colours of the flowery field?</l>
               <l>Can the New-River's artificial ſtreams,</l>
               <l>Or the thick waters of the troubled Thames,</l>
               <l>In many a winding ruſty pipe convey'd,</l>
               <l>Or daſh'd and broken down a deep caſcade,</l>
               <l>With our clear ſilver ſtreams in ſweetneſs vie,</l>

               <l>Glide o'er the ſands, or glitter thro' the graſs?</l>
               <l>And yet in town the country proſpects pleaſe,</l>
               <l>Where ſtately colonnades are flank'd with trees:</l>
               <l>On a whole country looks the maſter down</l>
               <l>With pride, where ſcarce five acres are his own.</l>

               <l>The wretch, whoſe frantic pride kind fortune crowns,</l>
               <l>Grows twice as abject when the goddeſs frowns;</l>
               <l>As he, who riſes when his head turns round,</l>
               <l>Muſt tumble twice as heavy to the ground.</l>

               <l>We live far happier by theſe gurgling ſprings,</l>
               <l>Than ſtateſmen, courtiers, counſellors, or kings.</l>
               <l>The ſtag expell'd the courſer from the plain;—</l>
               <l>What can he do?—he begs the aid of man;</l>
               <l>He takes the bit, and proudly bears away</l>

               <l>To quit his maſter, and the curb again.</l>

               <l>But loſe their nobleſt wealth, their liberty;</l>
               <l>To their imperious paſſions they ſubmit,</l>

               <l>To pay my doctor's, or my lawyer's bill.</l>

            <head>ODE TO JOHN PITT, ESQ. ADVISING HIM TO BUILD A BANQUETING-HOUSE ON A HILL THAT OVERLOOKS THE SEA.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>FRom this tall promontory's brow</l>

               <l>O bid, my friend, a ſtructure riſe,</l>
               <l>And this huge round command;</l>
               <l>Then ſhall this little point compriſe</l>
               <l>The ocean and the land.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then you, like Aeolus, on high,</l>

               <l>Shall ſee ſecure the billows fly,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You, with a ſmile, their rage deſpiſe,</l>

               <l>(My Lord abroad) and dinner ſerv'd in plate;</l>
               <l>Which, tho' it ſeem'd but common ſoup and haſh,</l>
               <l>Was really callipee and callipaſh,</l>
               <l>(The relicks of the gaudy day before)</l>
               <l>What Indians eat, and Engliſhmen adore;</l>
               <l>With bright champaign the courtier crown'd the feaſt,</l>
               <l>Sooth'd his own pride, and gratified his gueſt:</l>
               <l>All this conſpir'd our Stoic to controul,</l>
               <l>And warpt the ſteady purpoſe of his ſoul—</l>
               <l>When lo! the cry of fire creates amaze—</l>

            <l>IF you, dear ſir, will deign to paſs a day</l>
            <l>In the fair vale of Orpington and Cray,</l>
            <l>And live for once as humble vicars do;</l>
            <l>On Thurſday let me ſee you here by two.</l>
            <l>Expect no niceties my plates to foul,</l>
            <l>But Banſted mutton, and a barn-door fowl.</l>
            <l>My friends with generous liquors I regale,</l>
            <l>Good port, old hock, or, if they like it, ale;</l>
            <l>But if of richer wine you chuſe a quart,</l>
            <l>Why bring, and drink it here—with all my heart.</l>
            <l>Plain is my furniture, as is my treat,</l>
            <l>For 'tis my beſt ambition, To be neat.</l>
            <l>Leave then all ſordid views, and hopes of gain,</l>
            <l>To mortals miſerable, mad, or vain;</l>
            <l>Put the laſt poliſh to th' hiſtoric page,</l>
            <l>And ceaſe awhile to moralize the age.</l>
            <l>By your ſweet converſe cheer'd, the live-long day</l>
            <l>Will paſs unnotic'd, like the ſtream, away.</l>
            <l>Why ſhould kind Providence abundance give,</l>
            <l>If we, like niggards, can't afford to live?</l>
            <l>The wretched miſer, poor 'midſt heaps of pelf,</l>
            <l>To cram his heir, moſt madly ſtarves himſelf—</l>
            <l>So will not I—give me good wine and eaſe,</l>
            <l>And let all miſers call me fool that pleaſe.</l>

            <l>Faint Hope grows brilliant o'er the ſparkling bowl:</l>
            <l>Wine's generous ſpirit makes the coward brave,</l>
            <l>Gives eaſe to kings, and freedom to the ſlave:</l>
            <l>Bemus'd in wine the Bard his duns forgets,</l>
            <l>And drinks ſerene oblivion to his debts:</l>
            <l>Wine drives all cares, and anguiſh from the heart,</l>
            <l>And dubs us Connoiſſeurs of every art:</l>
            <l>Whom does not wine with eloquence inſpire?</l>
            <l>The bouſy beggar ſtruts into a ſquire.</l>
            <l>This you well know—to me belongs to mind</l>
            <l>That neatneſs with frugality be join'd;</l>
            <l>That no intruding Blab, with itching ears,</l>

               <l>In endleſs chains of deep damnation,</l>
               <l>Who firſt to plague us did invent</l>

               <l>Cramm'd in a tub, ſtuck full of nails,</l>
               <l>Like Regulus we die with rolling.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>A plague upon the nauſeous brine,</l>

               <l>Unleſs with rank diſeaſe we pine,</l>

               <l>Decreed their deaths, and ſent ſalt water.</l>
