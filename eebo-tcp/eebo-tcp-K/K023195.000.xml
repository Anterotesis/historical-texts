            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>NOTES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>OME modern Criticks, from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Refinement of Taſte, have declar'd themſelves unable to reliſh allegorical Poems. 'Tis not eaſy to penetrate into the meaning of this Criticiſm; for if <hi>Fable</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd one of the chief Beauties, or as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it, the very <hi>Soul</hi> of Poetry, 'tis hard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how that Fable ſhould be the leſs valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for having a Moral. The Ancients conſtantly made uſe of Allegories: My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd an expreſs Treatiſe in proof of this, entitled, <hi>The Wiſdom of the Antients;</hi> where the Reader may ſee ſeveral particular Fictions exemplify'd and explain'd with great Clearneſs, Judgment and Learning. The Incidents indeed, by which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory is convey'd, muſt be vary'd, according to the different Genius or Manners of different Times: and they ſhould never be ſpun too long, or too much clogg'd with trivial Circumſtances, or little Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities. We find an uncommon Charm in Truth, when it is convey'd by this Side-way to our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and 'tis obſervable, that even in the moſt ignorant Ages this way of Writing has found Reception. Almoſt all the Poems in the old <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vençal</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1027600800:44"/>
had this Turn; and from theſe it was that <hi>Petrarch</hi> took the Idea of his Poetry. We have his <hi>Trionfi</hi> in this kind; and <hi>Boccace</hi> purſu'd in the ſame Track. Soon after <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> introduc'd it here, whoſe <hi>Romaunt of the Roſe, Court of Love, Flower and the Leaf, Houſe of Fame,</hi> and ſome others of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are Maſter-pieces of this ſort. In Epick Poetry, 'tis true, too nice and exact a Purſuit of the Allegory is juſtly eſteem'd a Fault; and <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> had the Diſcernment to avoid it in his <hi>Knight</hi>'s <hi>Tale,</hi> which was an Attempt towards an Epick Poem. <hi>Arioſto,</hi> with leſs judgment, gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely into it in his <hi>Orlando;</hi> which tho' carry'd to an Exceſs, had yet ſo much Reputation in <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Taſſo</hi> (who reduc'd Heroick Poetry to the juſter Standard of the Ancients) was forc'd to prefix to his Work a ſcrupulous Explanation of the Allegory of it, to which the Fable it-ſelf could ſcarce have directed his Readers. Our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Spencer</hi> follow'd, whoſe Poem is almoſt intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allegorical, and imitates the manner of <hi>Arioſto</hi> rather than that of <hi>Taſſo.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the whole, one may obſerve this ſort of Writing (however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continu'd of late) was in all Times ſo far from being rejected by the beſt Poets, that ſome of them have rather err'd by inſiſting in it too cloſely, and carrying it too far: And that to infer from thence that the Allegory it ſelf is vicious, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Contradiction to the Judgment and Practice of the greateſt Genius's, both ancient and modern.</p>

               <p>Tho' a ſhort Veriſimilitude be not requir'd in the Deſcriptions of this viſionary and allegorical kind of Poetry, which admits of every wild Object that Fancy may preſent in a Dream, and where it is ſufficient if the moral Meaning atone for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability: Yet Men are naturally ſo deſirous of Truth, that a Reader is generally pleas'd, in ſuch a Caſe, with ſome Excuſe or Alluſion that ſeems to reconcile the Deſcription to Probability and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Simile here is of that ſort, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it not wholly unlikely that a <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Ice</hi> ſhould remain for ever, by mentioning ſomething like it in the Northern Regions, agreeing with the Accounts of our modern Travellers.</p>
