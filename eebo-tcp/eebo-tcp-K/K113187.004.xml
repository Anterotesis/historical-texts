            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MORE poetry was written in the ſingle reign of Elizabeth, than in the two preceding centuries. The ſame cauſes, among others already enumerated and explained, which called forth genius and imagination, ſuch as the new ſources of fiction opened by a ſtudy of the claſſics, a familiarity with the French Italian and Spaniſh writers, the growing elegancies of the Engliſh language, the diffuſion of poliſhed manners, the felicities of long peace and public proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and a certain freedom and activity of mind which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed the national emancipation from ſuperſtition, contributed alſo to produce innumerable compoſitions in poetry. In proſecuting my further examination of the poetical annals of this reign, it there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore becomes neceſſary to reduce ſuch a latitude of materials to ſome ſort of methodical arrangement. On which account, I ſhall claſs and conſider the poets of this reign, under the general heads, or diviſions, of SATIRE, SON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET, PASTORAL, and MISCELLANEOUS poetry. Spenſer will ſtand alone, without a claſs, and without a rival.</p>

Satire, ſpecifically ſo called, did not commence in England till the latter end of the reign of queen Elizabeth. We have ſeen, indeed, that eclogues, and allegories were made the vehicle of ſatire, and that many poems of a ſatirical tendency had been publiſhed, long ago. And here, the cenſure was rather confined to the corruptions of the clergy, than extended to popular follies and vices. But the firſt profeſſed Engliſh ſatiriſt, to ſpeak technically, is biſhop Joſeph Hall, ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly biſhop of Exeter and Norwich, born at Briſtow-park within the pariſh of Aſhby de la Zouch in Leiceſterſhire, in the year 1574, and at the age of fifteen, in the year 1588, admitted into Emanuel-college at Cambridge, where he remained about eight years. He ſoon became eminent in the theology of thoſe times, preached againſt predeſtination before prince Henry with unrivalled applauſe, and diſcuſſed the doctrines of Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm in voluminous diſſertations. But ſo variable are our ſtudies, and ſo fickle is opinion, that the poet is better known to poſterity than the prelate or the polemic. His ſatires have outlived his ſermons at court, and his laborious confutations of the Browniſts. One of his later controverſial tracts is, however, remembered on account of the celebrity of its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt. When Milton deſcended from his dignity to plead the cauſe of fanaticiſm and ideal liberty, biſhop Hall was the defender of our hierarchical eſtabliſhment. Bayle, who knew Hall only as a theologiſt, ſeems to have written his life merely becauſe he was one of the Engliſh divines at the Synod of Dort, in 1618. From his inflexible and conſcientious attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the royal and epiſcopal cauſe under king Charles the firſt, he ſuffered in his old age the ſeverities of impriſonment and ſequeſtration; and lived to ſee his cathedral converted into a barrack, and his palace into an ale-houſe. His uncommon learning was meliorated with great penetration and knowledge of the world, and his mildneſs of manners and his humility were characteriſtical. He died, and was obſcurely buried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a memorial on his grave, in 1656, and in his eighty ſecond
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0373600104:3"/>
year, at Heigham a ſmall village near Norwich, where he had ſought ſhelter from the ſtorms of uſurpation, and the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of preſbyterianiſm.</p>
            <p>I have had the good fortune to ſee biſhop Hall's funeral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſermon, preached ſome days after his interment, on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day of September, 1656, at ſaint Peter's church in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, by one John Whitefoote, Maſter of Arts, and rector of Heigham. The preacher, no contemptible orator, before he proceeds to draw a parallel between our prelate and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Iſrael, thus illuſtrates that part of his character with which we are chiefly concerned, and which I am now haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conſider. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Two yeares together he was choſen rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick profeſſor in the univerſitie of Cambridge, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the office with extraordinary applauſe. He was noted for a ſingular wit from his youth: a moſt acute rhetorician, and an elegant poet. He underſtood many tongues; and in the rhetorick of his own, he was ſecond to none that lived in his time <note n="a" place="bottom">Fol. 3.</note>."</q> It is much to our preſent purpoſe to obſerve, that the ſtyle of his proſe is ſtrongly tinctured with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Seneca. The writer of the ſatires is perceptible in ſome of his graveſt polemical or ſcriptural treatiſes; which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually interſperſed with excurſive illuſtrations, familiar alluſions, and obſervations on life. Many of them were early tranſlated into French; and their character is well drawn by himſelf, in a dedication to James the firſt, who perhaps would have much better reliſhed a more ſedate and profound theology. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Seldome any man hath offered to your royall hands a greater bundle of his owne thoughts, nor perhaps more varietie of diſcourſe.

At the age of twenty-three, while a ſtudent at Emanuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>college, and in the year 1597, he publiſhed at London three Books of anonymous Satires, which he called <hi>Toothleſs</hi> SATYRS, <hi>poetical, academical, moral</hi>

               </note>. They were printed by Thomas Creede for Robert Dexter, and are not recited in the regiſters of the Stationers of London. The following year, and licenced by the ſtationers, three more books appeared, entitled, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"VIRGIDEMIARUM, The three laſt Bookes of <hi>Byting</hi> Satyres."</q> Theſe are without his name, and were printed by Richard Bradock for Robert Dexter, in the ſize and letter of the laſt <note n="d" place="bottom">In pages 106.

It begins with the firſt three books: then at the end of the third book, follow the three laſt, but preceded by a new title, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"VIRGIDEMIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUM.

By VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIDEMIA, an uncouth and uncommon word, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a Gathering or Harveſt of rods, in reference to the nature of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſatires are marked with a claſſical preciſion, to which Engliſh poetry had yet rarely attained. They are replete with animation of ſtyle and ſentiment. The indignation of the ſatiriſt is always the reſult of good ſenſe. Nor are the thorns of ſevere invective unmixed with the flowers of pure poetry. The characters are delineated in ſtrong and lively colouring, and their diſcriminations are touched with the maſterly traces of genuine humour. The verſification is equally energetic and elegant, and the fabric of the couplets approaches to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ſtandard. It is no inconſiderable proof of a genius pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominating over the general taſte of an age when every preacher was a punſter, to have written verſes, where laughter was to be raiſed, and the reader to be entertained with ſallies of pleaſantry, without quibbles and conceits. His chief fault is obſcurity, ariſing from a remote phraſeology, conſtrained combinations, unfamiliar alluſions, elleiptical apoſtrophes, and abruptneſs of expreſſion. Perhaps ſome will think, that his manner betrays too much of the laborious exactneſs and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantic anxiety of the ſcholar and the ſtudent. Arioſto in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, and Regnier in French, were now almoſt the only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern writers of ſatire: and I believe there had been an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tranſlation of Arioſto's ſatires. But Hall's acknowledged patterns are Juvenal and Perſius, not without ſome touches of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0373600104:6"/>
the urbanity of Horace. His parodies of theſe poets, or rather his adaptations of antient to modern manners, a mode of imitation not unhappily practiced by Oldham, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, and Pope, diſcover great facility and dexterity of invention. The moral gravity and the cenſorial declamation of Juvenal, he frequently enlivens with a train of more refined reflection, or adorns with a novelty and variety of images.</p>
            <p>In the opening of his general PROLOGUE, he expreſſes a decent conſciouſneſs of the difficulty and danger of his new undertaking. The laurel which he ſought had been unworn, and it was not to be won without hazard.</p>

            <p>His firſt book, containing nine ſatires, is aimed at the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous impotent yet faſhionable ſcribblers with which his age was infeſted. It muſt be eſteemed a curious and valuable pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, drawn from real life, of the abuſes of poetical compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which then prevailed; and which our author has at once expoſed with the wit of a ſpirited ſatiriſt, and the good taſte of a judicious critic. Of Spenſer, who could not have been his cotemporary at Cambridge, as ſome have thought, but perhaps was his friend, he conſtantly ſpeaks with reſpect and applauſe.</p>
            <p>I avail myſelf of a more minute analyſis of this Book, not only as diſplaying the critical talents of our ſatiriſt, but as hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical of the poetry of the preſent period, and illuſtrative of my general ſubject. And if in general, I ſhould be thought too copious and prolix in my examination of theſe ſatires, my apology muſt be, my wiſh to revive a neglected writer of real genius, and my opinion, that the firſt legitimate author in our language of a ſpecies of poetry of the moſt important and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0373600104:7"/>
popular utility, which our countrymen have ſo ſucceſsfully cultivated, and from which Pope derives his chief celebrity, deſerved to be diſtinguiſhed with a particular degree of attention.</p>
            <p>From the firſt ſatire, which I ſhall exhibit at length, we learn what kinds of pieces were then moſt in faſhion, and in what manner they were written.

            <p>The compliment in the cloſe to Spenſer, is introduced and turned with ſingular addreſs and elegance. The alluſion is to Spenſer's beautiful epiſode of the marriage of Thames and Medway, recently publiſhed, in 1595, in the fourth book of the ſecond part of the FAIRY QUEEN <note n="q" place="bottom">B. iv.

            <p>In the Prologue to this book, our author ſtrives to obviate the objections of certain critics who falſely and fooliſhly thought his ſatires too perſpicuous. Nothing could be more abſurd, than the notion, that becauſe Perſius is obſcure, therefore obſcurity muſt be neceſſarily one of the qualities of ſatire. If Perſius, under the ſeverities of a proſcriptive and ſanguinary government, was often obliged to conceal his meaning, this was not the caſe of Hall. But the darkneſs and difficulties of Perſius ariſe in great meaſure from his own affectation and falſe taſte. He would have been enigmatical under the mildeſt government. To be unintelligible can never naturally or properly belong to any ſpecies of writing. Hall of himſelf is certainly obſcure: yet he owes ſome of his obſcurity to an imitation of this ideal excellence of the Roman ſatiriſts.</p>
            <p>The fourth Book breathes a ſtronger ſpirit of indignation,

The character of Labeo, already repeatedly mentioned, who was ſome cotemporary poet, a conſtant cenſurer of our author, and who from paſtoral proceeded to heroic poetry, is here more diſtinctly repreſented. He was a writer who affected compound epithets, which ſir Philip Sydney had imported from France, and firſt uſed in his ARCADIA <note n="p" place="bottom">We have our author's opinion of Skelton in theſe lines of this ſatire. f. 83.

But whatever fame they had acquired, it ſoon received a check, which was never recovered. They were condemned to the flames, as licentious and immoral, by an order of biſhop Bancroft in 1599. And this is obviouſly the chief reaſon why they are not named by our author, in the SPECIALITIES of his Life, written by himſelf after his preferment to a biſhoprick <note n="y" place="bottom">SHAKING OF THE OLIVE, or his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Works, 1660. 4to. Nor are they here inſerted.</note>. They were, however, admired and imitated by Oldham. And Pope, who moderniſed Donne, is ſaid to have wiſhed he had ſeen Hall's ſatires ſooner. But had Pope undertaken to moderniſe Hall, he muſt have adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he could not have improved, many of his lines. Hall is too finiſhed and ſmooth for ſuch an operation. Donne, though he lived ſo many years later, was ſuſceptible of modern refinement, and his aſperities were ſuch as wanted and would bear the chiſſel.</p>
            <p>I was informed, by the late learned biſhop of Gloceſter, that in a copy of Hall's Satires in Pope's library, the whole firſt ſatire of the ſixth book was corrected in the margin, or interlined, in Pope's own hadn; and that Pope had written at the head of that ſatire, OPTIMA SATIRA.</p>
            <p>Milton who had a controverſy with Hall, as I have obſerved, in a remonſtrance called an APOLOGY FOR SMECTYMNUUS, publiſhed in 1641, rather unſuitably and diſingenuouſly goes out of his way, to attack theſe ſatires, a juvenile effort of his dignified adverſary, and under every conſideration alien to the diſpute. Milton's ſtrictures are more ſarcaſtic than critical; yet they deſerve to be cited, more eſpecially as they preſent a ſtriking ſpecimen of thoſe aukward attempts at humour and raillery, which diſgrace his proſe-works.</p>

For a Satyr is as it were born out of a Tragedy, ſo ought to reſemble his parentage, to ſtrike high, and adventure dangerouſly at the moſt eminent vices among the greateſt perſons, and not to creep into every blind taphouſe that fears a conſtable more than a ſatyr. But that ſuch a poem ſhould be TOOTHLESS, I ſtill affirm it to be a bull, taking away the eſſence of that which it calls itſelf. For if it bite neither the perſons nor the vices, how is it a ſatyr?

The author of the Satires appears in ſtanzas, x. xiv. xix. I have thought that this poem ſuggeſted to Shakeſpeare what Lucio ſays in MEASURE FOR MEASURE. A. iii. S. ii. Vol. ii. p. 92. [See ſupr. vol. iii. 417.]</note>. The Satires here ſpecified are only four in number. In Charles Fitzgeoffry's AFFANIAE, a ſet of Latin epigrams, printed at Oxford in 1601, he is not inelegantly complimented as the ſecond Engliſh Satiriſt, or rather as dividing the palm of priority and excellence in Engliſh ſatire with Hall.</p>

            <p>Marſton ſeems to have been the poetic rival of Hall at Cambridge, whom he repeatedly cenſures or ridicules. In the fourth ſatire, he ſuppoſes Hall's criticiſms on Dubartas, the verſions of David's Pſalms by Sternhold and king James, Southwell's MARY and SAINT PETER'S TEARS, the MIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROUR OF MAGISTRATES, and other pieces of equal reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be the production of pedantry or malignity. And the remainder of this ſatire is no unpleaſant parody of Hall's prefatory ſtanzas againſt envy <note n="k" place="bottom">
                  <p>It appears from the SCOURGE OF VILLANIE, that Hall had cauſed a ſevere Epigram to be paſted on the laſt page of every copy of Marſton's PIGMALION'S IMAGE, that was ſent from London to the bookſellers of Cambridge.

            <p>It is not that I am afraid of being tedious, that I find myſelf obliged to refrain from producing any more citations. There are however, a few more paſſages which may ſafely be quoted, but which I chooſe to reſerve for future illuſtration.</p>
            <p>There is a careleſſneſs and laxity in Marſton's verſification, but there is a freedom and facility, which Hall has too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſſed, by labouring to confine the ſenſe to the couplet. Hall's meaſures are more muſical, not becauſe the muſic of verſe conſiſts in uniformity of pauſe, and regularity of cadence. Hall had a correcter ear; and his lines have a tuneful ſtrength, in proportion as his language is more poliſhed, his phraſeology more ſelect, and his ſtructure more ſtudied. Hall's meaning, among other reaſons, is not always ſo ſoon apprehended, on account of his compreſſion both in ſentiment and diction. Marſton is more perſpicuous, as he thinks leſs and writes haſtily. Hall is ſuperiour in penetration, accurate conception of character, acuteneſs of reflection, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of thoughts and images. Hall has more humour, Marſton more acrimony. Hall often draws his materials from books and the diligent peruſal of other ſatiriſts, Marſton from real life. Yet Hall has a larger variety of characters. He poſſeſſed the talent of borrowing with addreſs, and of giving originality to his copies. On the whole, Hall is more elegant, exact, and elaborate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0373600104:68"/>
It is Marſton's misfortune, that he can never keep clear of the impurities of the brothel. His ſtream of poetry, if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bright and unpolluted, almoſt always betrays a muddy bottom. The ſatiriſt who too freely indulges himſelf in the diſplay of that licentiouſneſs which he means to proſcribe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely defeats his own deſign. He inflames thoſe paſſions which he profeſſes to ſuppreſs, gratifies the depravations of a prurient curioſity, and ſeduces innocent minds to an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with ideas which they might never have known.</p>
            <p>The ſatires of Hall and Marſton were condemned to the ſame flame and by the ſame authority. But Hall certainly deſerved a milder ſentence. Hall expoſes vice, not in the wantonneſs of deſcription, but with the reſerve of a cautious yet lively moraliſt. Perhaps every cenſurer of obſcenity does ſome harm, by turning the attention to an immodeſt object. But this effect is to be counteracted by the force and propriety of his reproof, by ſhewing the pernicious conſequences of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous exceſſes, by ſuggeſting motives to an oppoſite conduct, and by making the picture diſguſtful by daſhes of deformity. When Vice is led forth to be ſacrificed at the ſhrine of virtue, the victim ſhould not be too richly dreſſed.</p>

            <p>Owen's idea of an epigram points out the notion which now prevailed of this kind of compoſition, and ſhews the propriety of blending the epigrams and ſatires of theſe times, under one claſs.
