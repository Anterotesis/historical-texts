            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHEN theſe MISCELLANIES are inſcribed to a PERCY, I place them under the moſt auſpicious ſhelter. THE RELIQUES OF ANCIENT POETRY, with which you obliged the world in your younger years, would, independent of all other claims, have pointed you out as a proper Patron to theſe Fugitive Remains. But, excellent as your own Publications are, it is neither to them, nor to your elevated Station in Life, that I pay this diſintereſted Tribute.</p>
            <p>Happy in a Family Connexion, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever remotely, entitles me to claim Relationſhip with the Poet CLEIVELAND (extracts from whoſe Works will add merit to a future volume
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0771900501:5"/>
of this Collection); I am proud to have it known that the DEAN OF CARLISLE derives his deſcent from the ſame Family, his father's mother having been niece to the Bard above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned: a Family diſtinguiſhed in private life for having produced a ſucceſſion of moſt excellent Clergymen, treading in the ſteps of their venerable Anceſtor, the Rev. THOMAS CLEIVELAND, father of the Poet, who is upon record<note n="*" place="bottom">See "Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy," p. 221.</note> for his very worthy character and moſt exemplary life.</p>
            <p>That urbanity, Sir, with which you recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized me as of kin to you, and the Friendſhip I have ſince in conſequence experienced from you, as they have made an indelible impreſſion, demand the warm acknowledgements with which theſe volumes are moſt reſpectfully preſented by,</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THIS Collection, though formed principally from that of Mr. DRYDEN, is by no means a mere republication; which would now have been particularly ill-timed, as a large portion of that excellent Miſcellany (the firſt which appeared in this kingdom with reputation) is very properly arranged among the
"Works of the Engliſh Poets;" and ſome pages had crept into DRYDEN's Collection, which may be permitted to periſh without regret.
There ſtill, however, are an infinite number of ſmall poems, which, coming under neither of theſe deſcriptions, muſt be allowed to poſſeſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable merit; being the productions of men of real genius, who, from the brevity rather than the inferiority of their writings, have been uſually ſtyled "Minor Poets."</p>
            <p>On DRYDEN's foundation the preſent ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure is begun. In its progreſs, almoſt every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of a ſimilar nature has been conſulted, and material parts incorporated. The Collections formed by FENTON and STEELE have been epitomized; whilſt POPE's, PEMBERTON's, LINTOT's, and
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0771900501:7"/>
C. TOOKE's, have occaſionally contributed to embelliſhment.</p>
            <p>The Collection by Mr. R. DODSLEY is allowed to be the completeſt of the kind; and with this the preſent publication is ſo far from interfering, that not a ſingle poem is intended to be printed, which is either in "DODSLEY's Collection," the Supplement to it by Mr. PEARCH, or in the Sixty Volumes of the "Engliſh Poets." To all or either of theſe, therefore, this Selection will be a ſuitable appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; and the more ſo, as I have preſerved ſome poems of merit, which before were not known to have exiſted.</p>
            <p>The Reader will find in theſe volumes ſome of the earlieſt productions of DRYDEN; ſome originals by Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE; an Ode by SWIFT, which had long been conſidered as irrecoverable; a conſiderable number of good poems by STEELE, PARNELL, FENTON, BROOME, and YALDEN, with a few pieces by HALIFAX, DORSET, RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHESTER, SPRAT, PRIOR<note n="*" place="bottom">The following anecdotes of this excellent Poet being curious, I print them in the words of the friend from whom they are received:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"At lord Oxford's ſeat at Wimple (now lord Hardwicke's) there hung a fine picture of Harley in his Speaker's robes, with the roll of the bill in his hand for bringing-in the preſent family; which, if I miſtake not, was done by his caſting vote. In alluſion to Harley's being afterwards ſent to The Tower, Prior wrote with a pencil on the white ſcroll, <hi>Bill paid ſuch a day.</hi>—The late Recorder of Cambridge [Pont] had ſeen ſome MS. Dialogues of the Dead of Prior's; they were proſe, but had verſe intermixed freely: and the ſpecimen, I heard, proved it. The Dialogue was between Sir Thomas More and the Vicar of Bray. You muſt allow that the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are well choſen; and the ſpeakers maintain their reſpective opinions ſmartly: at laſt the Knight ſeems to come over to his adverſary, at leaſt ſo far as to allow that the doctrine was convenient, if not honourable; but that he did not ſee how any man could allow himſelf to act thus: when the Vicar concludes; Nothing eaſier, with proper management; &amp;c.
You muſt go the right way to work—
<q>
                        <l>" For Conſcience, like a fiery horſe,</l>
                        <l>" Will ſtumble, if you check his courſe:</l>
                        <l>" But ride him with an eaſy rein,</l>
                        <l>" And rub him down with worldly gain,</l>
                        <l>" He'll carry you through thick and thin,</l>
                        <l>" Safe, although dirty, to your inn."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
This certainly is ſterling ſenſe.—It would give me great pleaſure to be enabled to preſent theſe Dialogues to the world; but where they are now depoſited is unknown.</note>, POPE, BOLING-BROKE,

PHILIPS, KING, SMITH, WATTS, PITT, HUGHES, A. PHILIPS, and TICKELL, which are not to be found in any edition of their works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0771900501:9"/>The aſſiſtance of ſome intelligent friends has enabled me to add a biographical account of almoſt every Writer here ſelected; and their perſuaſions have induced me to lay before the publick FOUR VOLUMES, as part of the plan I have undertaken. Two others are actually in the preſs. There are ſtill an infinite number of Collections, which, amidſt a chaos of weeds, would afford a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of flowers well worth the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting. But the encouragement theſe meet with muſt determine whether the publication ſhall ceaſe at the end of the SIXTH volume, or be extended ſtill farther. Without any great idea of emolument, which in this caſe is far from being the principal object, I am unwilling to ſacrifice the little leiſure of a laborious life in a purſuit that I have not reaſon to think will in ſome ſmall degree contribute to <q rend="inline">"the public ſtock of harmleſs pleaſure."</q>
            </p>
            <p>To my concluding volume ſhall be annexed a complete POETICAL INDEX. In the mean time, for the convenience of the Reader, a ſhort Index to the Notes will follow this Advertiſement.</p>

"Ovid's Epiſtles, by ſeveral hands," 1720;
where it is followed by another tranſlation of it by Mr. Pope; undertaken, as that great poet expreſsly ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"not from any ſuppoſed defect in Sir Carr's tranſlation,"</q> but becauſe he had not taken the whole of the original.

            <byline>BY THE HON. SIR CARR SCROPE<note n="†" place="bottom">Son of Sir Adrian Scrope, of Cockrington in Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, knight. He became a gentleman commoner of Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham College in 1664; was created a baronet Jan. 16, 1666; and took the degree of M.A. on the fourth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary following. His poems are not numerous; conſiſting principally of tranſlations and lampoons. In his
"Defence of Satire,"
we are told by Anthony Wood, there are reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"1. John earl of Rocheſter; 2. Edward Griffin; 3. Wroth the page; 4. Franc. Newport; 5. Lord Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pepper; 6. Henry Savil; 7. James duke of Monmouth; 8. Tho. Armſtrong; 9.—Loftus; 10. Brandon Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard; 11. Jermyn earl of St. Albans; 12. Finch lord chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor."</q>
This produced, as might have been expected, the keeneſt reſentment of Rocheſter (ſee his Poems, 1779, p. 340). Sir Carr tranſlated the fourth elegy of Ovid's firſt book, and "The Parting of Sireno and Diana;" wrote the Prologue to Lee's "Rival Queens," and to
"The Man of Mode;" and ſeveral ſongs introduced into the plays of thoſe times.
He died, in the pariſh of St. Martin in the Fields, in or about November, 1680. He is mentioned with reſpect by Dr. King, Poems, p. 271. Wood refers to a MS Song "on Scrope, Godolphin, and Dorſet," in Mr. Sheldon's Library.
"The Parting of Sireno and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana," Wood ſays, was tranſlated from the third book of Ovid's Elegies; but it is more probably from an Italian ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.

            <head>THE PARTING OF SIRENO AND DIANA.</head>
            <byline>BY THE SAME.</byline>
            <argument>
               <p>Sireno and Diana having loved each other with a moſt violent paſſion, Sireno is compelled, upon the account of his maſter's ſervice, to go for ſome time into a foreign country. The melancholy parting of the two lovers is the ſubject of the following eclogue.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>CLOSE by a ſtream, whoſe flowery bank might give</l>
            <l>Delight to eyes that had no cauſe to grieve,</l>
            <l>The ſad Sireno ſate, and fed his ſheep,</l>
            <l>Which now, alas! he had no joy to keep;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0771900501:24"/>Since his hard fate compell'd him to depart</l>
            <l>From her dear ſight, who long had charm'd his heart.</l>
            <l>Fix'd were his thoughts upon the fatal day</l>
            <l>That gave him firſt what this muſt take away;</l>
            <l>Through all the ſtory of his love he ran,</l>
            <l>And nought forgot that might increaſe his pain.</l>
            <l>Then with a ſigh raiſing his heavy eyes,</l>
            <l>Th' approach of his afflicted nymph he ſpies.</l>
            <l>Sad as ſhe was, ſhe loſt no uſual grace,</l>
            <l>But as ſhe paſs'd ſeem'd to adorn the place:</l>
            <l>Thither ſhe came to take her laſt farewell;</l>
            <l>Her ſilent look did her ſad buſineſs tell.</l>
            <l>Under a neighbouring tree they ſate them down,</l>
            <l>Whoſe ſhade had oft preſerv'd them from the ſun;</l>
            <l>Each took the other by the willing hand,</l>
            <l>Striving to ſpeak, but could no word command:</l>
            <l>With mutual grief both were ſo overcome,</l>
            <l>The much they had to ſay had made them dumb.</l>
            <l>There many a time they two had met before,</l>
            <l>But met, alas! upon a happier ſcore:</l>
            <l>Cruel reverſe of fate, which all the joys</l>
            <l>Their mutual preſence us'd to bring deſtroys.</l>
            <l>Sireno ſaw his fatal hour draw near,</l>
            <l>And, wanting ſtrength the parting pang to bear,</l>
            <l>All drown'd in tears he gaz'd upon the maid,</l>
            <l>And ſhe with equal grief the ſwain ſurvey'd;</l>
            <l>Till his impriſon'd paſſion forc'd its way,</l>
            <l>And gave him leave faintly at laſt to ſay:</l>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIRENO.</speaker>
               <l>O my Diana! who would have believ'd</l>
               <l>That when the ſad Sireno moſt had griev'd,</l>

               <l>Let but Diana ſmile, and all was well.</l>
               <l>Abſent from thee, my ſoul no joy could know;</l>

               <l>Turn, O Sireno! turn away thy face,</l>
               <l>While all her ſhame a bluſhing maid betrays;</l>
               <l>For though my eyes a ſecret pain reveal,</l>
               <l>My tongue at leaſt ſhould my fond thoughts conceal:</l>
               <l>Yet I would ſpeak, could ſpeaking do me good,</l>

               <l>O ſhepherd, think how wretched I ſhall be,</l>
               <l>When hither I return depriv'd of thee!</l>

               <l>Of our paſt love the kind affecting mark;</l>
               <l>Then my deſpairing ſoul to death nuſt fly;</l>
               <l>And muſt thou be content to let me die?</l>
               <l>Why doſt thou weep? Alas! thoſe tears are vain,</l>
               <l>Since 'tis thy fault that both of us complain.</l>
               <l>By this the falſehood of thy vows I know;</l>

            <head>ON MR. WALLER.</head>
            <byline>BY SIR THOMAS HIGGONS<note n="*" place="bottom">Son of Dr. Thomas Higgons, ſome time rector of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh in Shropſhire. He was born in that county; became a commoner of St. Albans Hall in the beginning of the year 1638, at the age of 14; when he was put under the tuition of Mr. Edward Corbet, fellow of Merton College, and lodged in the chamber under him in that houſe. Leaving the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity without a degree, he retired to his native county. He married the widow of Robert earl of Eſſex; and delivered an oration at her funeral, Sept. 16, 1656.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Oratio ſunebri, a marito ipſo, more priſco laudata fuit,"</q> is part of this lady's epitaph.
He married, ſecondly, Bridget daughter of Sir Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Greenvill of Stow, and ſiſter to John earl of Bath; and removed to Grewell in Hampſhire; was elected a burgeſs for Malmſbury in 1658, and for New Windſor in 1661. His ſervices to the crown were rewarded with a penſion of 500£. a year, and gifts to the amount of 4000£. He was afterwards knighted; and in 1669 was ſent envoy extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to inveſt John George duke of Saxony with the order of the Garter. About four years after he was ſent envoy to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna, where he continued three years. In 1685 he was elected burgeſs for St. Germain's, "being then," ſays Wood,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"accounted a loyal and accompliſhed perſon, and a great lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the regular clergy."</q>
He died ſuddenly, of an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, in the king's-bench court, having been ſummoned there as a witneſs, November 24, 1691; and was buried in Wincheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cathedral near the relicks of his firſt wife. His literary productions are, 1. "A Panegyric to the King, 1660." fol. 2. "The Funeral Oration on his firſt Lady, 1656." 3.
"The Hiſtory of Iſoof Baſſa, 1684."
He alſo tranſlated into Engliſh "The Venetian Triumph;" for which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented by Waller, in his Poems, p. 113; who has alſo addreſſed a poem to <hi>Mrs.</hi> Higgons, p. 201. Mr. Granger, who ſtyles Sir Thomas <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a gentleman of great merit,"</q> was favoured by the dutcheſs dowager of Portland with a manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript copy of his Oration; and concludes, from the great ſcarcity of that pamphlet, that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"the copies of it were, for certain reaſons, induſtriouſly collected and deſtroyed, though few pieces of this kind have leſs deſerved to periſh. The counteſs of Eſſex had a greatneſs of mind which enabled her to bear the whole weight of infamy which was thrown upon her; but it was, nevertheleſs, attended with a delicacy and ſenſibility of honour which poiſoned all her enjoyments. Mr. Higgons had ſaid much, and I think, much to the purpoſe, in her vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication: and was himſelf fully convinced from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of her life, and the words which the ſpoke at the awful cloſe of it, that the was perfectly innocent.—In reading this intereſting oration, I fancied myſelf ſtanding by the grave of injured innocence and beauty; was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly touched with the pious affection of the tendereſt and beſt of huſbands doing public and ſolemn juſtice to an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and worthy woman, who had been groſsly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly defamed. Nor could I with-hold the tribute of a tear; a tribute which, I am confident, was paid at her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment by every one who loved virtue, and was not deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the feelings of humanity. This is what I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately wrote upon reading the oration. If I am wrong in my opinion, the benevolent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <head>TO THE DUKE, ON HIS RETURN. <date>1682.</date>
            </head>
            <byline>BY NATHANAEL LEE<note n="*" place="bottom">This celebrated dramatic poet was the ſon of a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and bred at Weſtminſter-ſchool under the famous Dr. Buſby, whence he removed to Trinity college in Cambridge; became ſcholar upon that foundation in 1668, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded A.B. the ſame year; but not ſucceeding to a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he quitted the univerſity, and came to London, where he made an unſucceſsful attempt to become an actor in 1672. The part he performed was Duncan in Sir William Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's alteration of Macbeth. Failing in this deſign, he had recourſe to his pen for a ſupport, and, having a genius for the drama, he compoſed a tragedy called "Nero emperor of Rome," in 1675, which being well received, he puſhed on the ſame way, producing a new play almoſt every year one with another, till 1681. Though unſucceſsful in his performance on the ſtage, yet it is obſerved by Cibber, that he read his pieces with a degree of excellence which aſtoniſhed the moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital actors of that age. Mr. Lee was not only careleſs in his oeconomy, a foible incident to the poetic race, but rakiſhly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ravagant: to that degree, as to be frequently plunged into the loweſt depths of miſery: his wit and genius were alſo of the ſame unlucky turn, turgid, unbridled, and apt to break the bounds of ſenſe. Thus gifted by nature, he left the reins looſe to his imagination, till at length indigence and poetical enthuſiaſm tranſported him into madneſs; ſo that, in November 1684, he was taken into Bedlam, where he continued four years under the care of the phyſicians. He was diſcharged in April 1688, being ſo much recovered as to be able to return to his occupation of writing for the ſtage. And he produced two plays afterwards,
"The Princeſs of Cleve," in 1689, and "The maſſacre of Paris," the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year.
However, notwithſtanding the profits ariſing from theſe performances, he was this year reduced to ſo low <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erhaps his untimely end might be occaſioned by one. He died this year, 1690, as it is ſaid, in a drunken frolic, by night in the ſtreet, and was interred in the pariſh of St. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Danes, near Temple-bar. He is the author of eleven plays, all acted with applauſe, and printed as ſoon as finiſhed, with dedications of moſt of them to the earls of Dorſet, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, Pembroke, the ducheſſes of Portſmouth and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, as his patrons. Mr. Addiſon declares, that, among our modern Engliſh poets, there was none better turned for tragedy than our author, if, inſtead of favouring the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of his genius, he had reſtrained it, and kept it within proper bounds. His thoughts are wonderfully ſuited to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, but frequently loſt in ſuch a cloud of words, that it is hard to ſee the beauty of them. There is an infinite fire in his works, but ſo involved in ſmoke, that it does not appear in half its luſtre. He frequently ſucceeds in the paſſionate parts of the tragedy, but more particularly where he ſlackens his efforts, and eaſes the ſtyle of thoſe epithets and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors in which he ſo much abounds. His "Rival Queens," and "Theodoſius or the Force of Love," ſtill keep poſſeſſion of the ſtage. Theſe plays excel in moving the paſſions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that univerſal one, love. He is ſaid to be particularly a maſter in that art, and for that reaſon has been compared to Ovid among the ancients, and to Otway among the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns. Mr. Dryden prefixed a copy of commendatory verſes to the Rival Queens, and our author joined with that laureat in writing the tragedy of the Duke of Guiſe and that of Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipus. Theſe particulars are extracted principally from the Biographical Dictionary. N.</note>.</byline>

            <l>My people too at laſt their error ſee,</l>

            <l>Then ſighing ſaid, My ſoul's dear-purchas'd reſt,</l>
            <l>Welcome, O welcome, to my longing breaſt:</l>
            <l>Why ſhould I waſte a tear while thou art by?</l>
            <l>To all extremes of friendſhip let us fly,</l>
            <l>Diſdain the factious croud that would rebel,</l>
            <l>And mourn the men that durſt in death excel:</l>
            <l>Their fates were glorious, ſince for thee they fell.</l>
            <l>And as a prince has right his arms to wield,</l>
            <l>When ſtubborn rebels force him to the field;</l>
            <l>So for the loyal, who their lives lay down,</l>
            <l>He dares to hazard both his life and crown.</l>

               <l>She that was once ſo great: alas, how low!</l>
               <l>Once fill'd with joy, with deſolation now!</l>

            <head>ARIADNE'S COMPLAINT, UPON A ROCK IN THE ISLAND OF NAXOS ON BEING DESERTED BY THESEUS.</head>
            <byline>BY WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT<note n="*" place="bottom">Son of Thomas Cartwright, of Burford, in Oxfordſhire, was born Aug. 16, 1615. This is the account given by Lloyd. But Wood, who may be ſuppoſed well-informed, ſays, he was the ſon of a gentleman of broken fortune, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to keep an inn at Cirenceſter, in Glouceſterſhire; was born at Northway, near Tewkſbury, in September, 1611; and received the early part of his education at Cirenceſter Free-ſchool: being placed as a king's ſcholar at Weſtminſter, he was elected to Chriſt Church, Oxford, in 1628, where he took the degree of M.A. in 1635. The ſame writer informs us,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he went through the claſſes of Logick and Philoſophy with an unwearied induſtry, took holy orders, and became the moſt florid and ſcraphical preacher in the univerſity. He was another Tully and Virgil, as being moſt excellent for Oratory and Poetry; in which faculties, as alſo in the Greek tongue, he was ſo full and abſolute, that thoſe that beſt knew him, knew not in which he moſt excelled. So admirably well verſed alſo was he in Metaphyſicks, that when he was Reader of them in the Univerſity, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of them was never better performed than by him and his predeceſſor Thomas Barlow, of Queen's College. His preaching alſo was ſo graceful, and profound withal, that none of his time or age went beyond him. So that, if the Wits read his Poems, Divines his Sermons, and Philoſophers his Lectures on Ariſtotle's Metaphyſicks, they would ſcarcely believe that he died at a little above thirty years of age. But that which is moſt remarkable is, that theſe his high parts and abilities were accompanied with ſo much candour and ſweetneſs, that they made him equally beloved and admired of all perſons, eſpecially thoſe of the Gown and Court; who eſteemed alſo his life a fair copy of practic piety, a rare example of heroic worth, and in whom Arts, Learning, and Language, made up the true complement of perfection."</q>
In 1642 biſhop Duppa ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to be ſuccentor in the church of Saliſbury, and in 1643 he was choſen junior proctor of the univerſity. He was alſo metaphyſical reader to the univerſity. Ben Jonſon ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">"My ſon Cartwright writes like a man!"</q> There are extant, of this author's, four plays, beſides other poems, which were printed together in 1651, accompanied by above fifty copies of commendatory verſes by the wits of the univerſity. A. Wood tells us, Mr. Cartwright wrote alſo, 1. Poëmata Graeca et Latina. 2. An offspring of mercy iſſuing out of the womb of cruelty: a paſſion ſermon, preached at Chriſt Church in Oxford, on Acts ii. 23. 3. On the ſignal days in the month of November, in relation to the crown and royal family: a poem. 4. Poems and verſes containing airs for ſeveral voices, ſet by Mr. Henry Lawes. His "Royal Slave" was acted before the king and queen by his fellow-ſtudents of Chriſt Church; of whom the moſt applauded was Mr. Buſby, afterwards the celebrated maſter of Weſtminſter ſchool. Wit, learning, judgement, elocution, a graceful perſon and behaviour, occaſioned that well-known encomium of him from dean Fell,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That he was the utmoſt man could come to."</q>
This inſtance of the perfection of human nature was alſo an inſtance of its vanity. He was ſuddenly ſnatched away by a fever, in the prime of life, on the twenty-ninth of November, 1643; and had the honour to be regretted by his ſovereign and his queen, who were in Oxford at the time of his death. See Wood and Granger. Jacob ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Cartwright was a king's ſcholar at Eton under Dr. Olbaſton; eminent for learning and loyalty; an excellent ſcholar, and an admirable poet; expert in the Latin, Greek, French, and Italian languages.</q>
The wits of Oxford prefixed recommendatory verſes to his Works.—After ſuch eulogiums, it ſeems a kind of poetical blaſphemy to annex the opinion of Dr. King, who ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Cartwright's poems ſeem to me very indifferent!"</q> N.</note>.</byline>

He died on his paſſage; but his family arrived at Surinam, where his daughter became acquainted with Prince Oronooko, whoſe ſtory ſhe has given. Soon after her return to England, ſhe was married to Mr. Behn, a merchant of Dutch extraction. She was employed by Charles II, in 1666, in a political negotiation at Antwerp, which ſhe managed with much dexterity; but her intelligence (though well-ſounded) being diſregarded, ſhe renounced all ſtate affairs, and amuſed herſelf ſome time with the gallantries of Antwerp; and, when ſhe arrived at London, dedicated the reſt of her life to pleaſure and poetry. She publiſhed three volumes of miſcellany poems, the firſt in 1684, the ſecond in 1685, and the third in 1688. They conſiſt of ſongs and other little pieces, by the earl of Rocheſter, Sir George Etherege, Mr. Henry Criſp, and others, with ſome pieces of her own. To the ſecond miſcellany, is annexed a tranſlation of the duke of Rochefoucault's Moral Reflections, under the title of "Seneca unmaſked," an edition of which was printed in 1727, in four volumes 12 mo. She wrote alſo ſeventeen plays, ſome hiſtories and novels; and tranſlated M. Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle's Hiſtory of Oracles, and Plurality of Worlds, to which laſt ſhe annexed an eſſay on tranſlation and tranſlated proſe. The paraphraſe of Oenone's epiſtle to Paris, in the Engliſh tranſlation of Ovid's epiſtles, is Mrs. Behn's; and Mr. Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in his preface to that work, pays her the following compliment:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I was deſired to ſay, that the author, who is of the fair ſex, underſtood not Latin; but if ſhe does not, I am afraid ſhe has given us occaſion to be aſhamed who do."</q>
She was alſo the authoreſs of the celebrated letters between a nobleman and his ſiſter, printed in London, 1684; and we have extant of hers eight love-letters, to a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom ſhe paſſionately loved, and with whom ſhe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded under the name of Lycidas. They are printed in the life and memoirs of Mrs. Behn, prefixed to her hiſtories and novels. She died, after a long indiſpoſition, April 16, 1689, and was buried in the Cloiſters in Weſtminſter-Abbey. There are ſeveral encomiums on Mrs. Behn prefixed to her "Lover's Watch;" and Mr. Gildon, who was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with our poeteſs, ſpeaks of her in the higheſt terms. Dr. King tells us,

                     <l>" That ſhe who writes like her muſt ſurely pleaſe."</l>

Yet, pleaſing as they may be, the licentiouſneſs of her dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic pieces occaſioned the juſt cenſure of Mr. Pope:

            <argument>
               <p>The poet, in the epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis, deſcribes the genial bed, on which was wrought the ſtory of Theſeus and Ariadne; and on that occaſion makes a long digreſſion, part of which is the ſubject of the following poem.</p>

               <l>THERE, on th' extremeſt beach and fartheſt ſand,</l>
               <l>Deſerted Ariadne ſeem'd to ſtand,</l>
               <l>New-wak'd, and raving with her love, ſhe flew</l>
               <l>To the dire ſhore, from whence ſhe might purſue</l>
               <l>With longing eyes, but all alas in vain!</l>
               <l>The winged bark o'er the tempeſtuous main;</l>
               <l>For buried in fallacious ſleep ſhe lay,</l>
               <l>While through the waves falſe Theſeus cut his way,</l>
               <l>Regardleſs of her fate who ſav'd his youth;</l>
               <l>Winds bore away his promiſe and his truth.</l>
               <l>Like ſome wild Bacchanal unmov'd ſhe ſtood,</l>
               <l>And with fix'd eyes ſurvey'd the raging flood.</l>
               <l>There with alternate waves the ſea does roll,</l>
               <l>Nor leſs the tempeſts that diſtract her ſoul;</l>
               <l>Abandon'd to the winds her flowing hair,</l>

               <l>Her riſing breaſts with indignation ſwell,</l>
               <l>And her looſe robes diſdainfully repel.</l>

               <l>But ſhe nor them regards, nor waves that beat</l>
               <l>Her ſnowy legs, and wound her tender feet:</l>
               <l>On Theſeus her loſt ſenſes all attend,</l>
               <l>And all the paſſions of her ſoul depend.</l>
               <l>Long did her weaker ſenſe contend in vain.</l>
               <l>She ſunk at laſt beneath the mighty pain:</l>
               <l>With various ills beſet, and ſtupid grown,</l>
               <l>She loſt the power thoſe ills ev'n to bemoan:</l>
               <l>But when the firſt aſſault and fierce ſurprize</l>
               <l>Were paſt, and grief had found a paſſage at her eyes,</l>
               <l>With cruel hands her ſnowy breaſt ſhe wounds,</l>
               <l>Theſeus in vain through all the ſhore reſounds.</l>
               <l>Now, urg'd by love, ſhe plunges in the main,</l>
               <l>And now draws back her tender feet again:</l>

               <l>And, fixing on the ſhore her eyes, ſhe ſaid:</l>

            <lg>

            <l>Thus has the rebel to his country ſhow'd,</l>
            <l>How to be ſlaves at home, and thieves abroad.</l>
            <l>Such circuits makes the ſun, but not ſuch harms;</l>
            <l>This burns the places, that the other warms.</l>
            <l>Bad Phaeton a liker courſe did run,</l>
            <l>Spoil'd equally, but leſs uſurp'd the throne.</l>
            <l>No wonder then, if we do tears allow</l>
            <l>To him that gave us wars, and ruin too.</l>
            <l>Tyrants, that lov'd him, grieve, concern'd to ſee</l>
            <l>There muſt be puniſhment for cruelty.</l>
            <l>Nature herſelf rejoiced at his death,</l>
            <l>And on the waters ſung with ſuch a breath,</l>
            <l>As made the ſea dance higher than before,</l>
            <l>While her glad news came leaping to the ſhore.</l>

            <byline>BY MR. THOMAS RYMER<note n="*" place="bottom">A gentleman born in the North of England. On quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Univerſity, he became a member of Gray's Inn, and ſucceeded Mr. Shadwell as hiſtoriographer to K. William III. He wrote "The Engliſh Monarch," an heroic tragedy, 1678; ſeveral poems and tranſlations; and
"A View of the Tragedies of the laſt Age," which occaſioned thoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Remarks preſerved in the preface to Mr. Colman's edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Beaumont and Fletcher, and ſince by Dr. Johnſon in his "Life of Dryden," p. 316.
On Mr. Rymer's Poetry much commendation cannot be beſtowed, and therefore only a ſmall portion of it is ſelected; but he was an excellent Antiquary and Hiſtorian. Some of his pieces relating to our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are very good; and his valuable collection of the "Foedera," &amp;c. will be a laſting monument of his worth. He died December 14, 1713. N.</note>.</byline>

He wrote ſome others; and was the author of a tragedy, intituled,
"The Generous Conqueror, or the Timely Diſcovery," acted at Drury Lane, and printed in 4to, 1702.
See the prologue to this tragedy in Lord Lanſdowne's Poems, p. 220. He was a ſteady adherent to the cauſe of the exiled family; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied K.

Robert was a younger brother; and, being in favour with King William, was ſent envoy to Bruſſels about the year 1693. He was very much the man of pleaſure, and occaſionally invoked the Muſe. He wrote the extraordinary Preface to Lord Rocheſter's Valentinian; a tranſlation from the ſixth book of Virgil, on Aeneas's meeting with Dido, not worth preſerving; and ſome other little pieces. The poem here printed is an alluſion to Tacitus de Vitâ Agricolae. N.</note>

During the civil wars he was a zealous royaliſt; and was knighted at the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rewarded by the office of auditor of the exchequer. He was choſen member for Stockbridge in 1661; and for Caſtle Riſing in 1679 and 1688. He was ſo ſtrong an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the Revolution, as to diſclaim all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the Nonjurors; and, by his obſtinacy and pride, made many enemies. His patron the duke of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham had in 1663 expoſed him under the name of <hi>Bilboa</hi> in "The Rehearſal;" but afterwards altered his reſolution, and leveled his ridicule at a much greater name, under that of <hi>Bayes.</hi> He was alſo ridiculed in Shadwell's
"Sullen Lovers." 1670, under the name of <hi>Sir Poſitive At-all.</hi>
He publiſhed ſix plays, a volume of poems, and ſome treatiſes in proſe; was four times married; and died Sept. 3, 1698.—In Dryden, vol. II. p. 117, is a beautiful epiſtle

            <head type="sub">TO THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM<note n="†" place="bottom">George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, a noble writer, a man of great wit and humour, and of the moſt whimſical ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price, was the admiration and the jeſt of the reign of Charles II. He was the alchemiſt and the philoſopher; the fiddler and the poet; the mimic and the ſtateſman. He has left us a ſpecimen of his admirable wit in "The Rehearſal," which had a conſiderable effect in reforming the ſtage. It was finiſhed before the end of 1664; but the great plague and other accidents prevented its being acted before 1671. He is ſaid to have been aſſiſted in this comedy by Dr. Spratt, Mr. Clifford, and the celebrated author of Hudibras.—The duke was born Jan. 30, 1627, the year before his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's aſſaſſination. After many ſufferings in the royal cauſe, he ſolicited one of the daughters of Cromwell in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but was mortified with a denial. He afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the only daughter of lord Fairfax, and was ſoon commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to The Tower by the protector. On the Reſtoration, he was at firſt ſlighted by the king; but the charms of his wit and converſation ſoon prevailed, and he was appointed a lord of the bed-chamber. In May 1668, he purchaſed the office of maſter of the horſe; was inſtalled chancellor of Cambridge, June 7, 1671, and deprived of that office in 1674. He died, in contempt and miſery, April 16, 1688; a melancholy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the proſtitution of talents. His end is pathetically deſcribed in Mr. Pope's Epiſtle to Lord Bathurſt. And ſee ſome further particulars of a peer,

He was born at Fawſley in Northamptonſhire, and elected from Weſtminſter-ſchool to Trinity College, Cambridge, 1645. He was afterward a ſcholar of Wadham College, Oxford, where he took the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of B.A. July 6, 1649; was admitted probationer fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low July 3, 1651; and commenced B.A. on the 10th of the ſame month. In 1658, being junior proctor, an attempt was made to abrogate the ſtatute for wearing caps and hoods. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s was fruſtrated by his firmneſs, which he called
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"the moſt glorious action of his life."</q>
While Mr. Pope was in his proctorſhip, Mr. Sprat (afterwards biſhop) addreſſed to him "The Plague of Athens;" which fixes the date of that poem to 1658. He was appointed dean of Wadham College in 1660; aſtronomy profeſſor in Greſham College, March 8, 1660-1; created doctor of phyſic, Sept. 12, 1661; was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give up his fellowſhip, June 27, 1662, as incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the profeſſorſhip. He was choſen one of the firſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the Royal Society, May 20, 1663; and ſoon after had licenſe to travel for two years, during which time he made the tour of Italy. After the great fire, Sept. 2, 1666, the principal lodgings in Greſham College were taken up by the lord mayor and other perſons of note; but thoſe of Dr. Pope were preſerved for the uſe of the profeſſors and the Royal Society, who firſt aſſembled there on Tueſday the 11th of that month, but ſoon after removed to Arundel-Houſe in the Strand. Dr. Pope was choſen into the council of the Royal Society in 1667; and appointed regiſter of the dioceſe of Cheſter, March 16, 1668. He publiſhed, in 1670,
"The Memoirs of Monſieur Du Vall, with his laſt Speech and Epitaph."
[Claude Du Vall, a native of Normandy, was a briſk handſome fellow; but, being a notorious highway-man, was hanged at Tyburn, Jan. 21, 1669; and in this pamphlet the Doctor humourouſly raillied the faſhion, then prevalent among the ladies, of admiring Frenchmen.] In 1686, Dr. Pope had very nearly loſt his ſight by an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which had been of many years continuance; but was cured by Dr. Turbervill, as he handſomely acknowledges in the epitaph he wrote on that eminent oculiſt. He reſigned his profeſſorſhip, Sept. 21, 1687; and in 1693 publiſhed "The Wiſh," a well-known little poem. On the 16th of November that year he loſt all his books, by a fire in Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard-ſtreet. He publiſhed the "Life of Bp. Ward in 1697;" and "Moral and Political Fables" in 1698. The next year he withdrew from the Royal Society, and reſided principally at Epſom; but ſettled at laſt in Buning-fields, in the ſuburbs of London, where he died at a very advanced age, and was buried at Cripplegate Church, June 25, 1714. He wrote a copy of Verſes upon Anne Green, who was executed at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Dec. 14, 1650; and afterwards revived. [A narrative of this fact was printed at Oxford in 1651, 4to. intituled, "News from the Dead, &amp;c.," reprinted in Morgan's
"Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix Britannicus."
See likewiſe in Heath's Chronicle, p. 278; Plot's Natural Hiſtory of Oxfordſhire, p. 201; and Warton's "Life of Dr. Bathurſt." Sir Wm. Petty was one chiefly concerned in recovering her]. Dr. Pope was author of ſeveral humourous ballads, and of many ſerious treatiſes in proſe; which are enumerated in Dr. Ward's Lives of the Greſham Profeſſors; of which a valuable copy, with large MS additions by the author, is in The Britiſh Muſeum.

"The Poems of John Hoddeſdon, London, 12mo. 1650."—Neither theſe verſes, nor the prologue and two epilogues to "The Duke of Guiſe," having yet found admittance among the Works of this great Poet; I am happy in being thus able to ſupply the deficiency; and of obſerving, that he was <hi>not</hi> the author of

"An Exclamation againſt Julian, Secretary of the Muſes; with the Character of a Libeller [Sir Charles Scrope]. By a Perſon of Quality [Lord Mulgrave]."
Having the original edition before me, I think it neceſſary to point out the following material errors in that of 1778: P. 157. l. 15. r. "leaves"—l. 23. r. "wight"—l. 26. r. "ſhe ſung Euphelia's"—P. 158. l. 20. r. "his ſelf-love,"—l. 21. r. "He dares"—l. 23. r. "the leaſt"—After l. 27, r.

At his return, he ſtudied the law for ſome time; which he ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for the belles lettres, and commenced dramatic writer in 1664. His firſt comedy,
"The Comical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge," ſecured to him the general eſteem of the publick.
He was married young to a widow of conſiderable fortune, who would not conſent to the match unleſs he could make her a lady by obtaining the honour of knighthood; which he applied for, and ſucceeded. His accompliſhments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him the favour of James the Second's queen, to whom (whilſt ſhe was only daughter of the duke of Modena) he had dedicated his "Man of Mode," 1676; and, by her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and recommendation, he was ſent envoy to Hamburgh. On the Revolution he followed the fortunes of James II. and died either in France, or very ſoon after his arrival in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land from thence; but there was a report that he came to an untimely end by an accident in conſequence of inebriation after a ſocial dinner he had given to ſome friends at Ratiſbon.

He ſeemed to be pleaſed with, and joined in the Revolution, and was made vice-chamberlain to Queen Mary; but having aſked a grant, which was refuſed him, and given to Lord Portland, he fell from the court, and was all that reign the moſt violent and open antagoniſt King William had in the Houſe. A great enemy to Foreigners ſettling in England; moſt clauſes in acts againſt them being brought in by him. He is indefatigable in whatever he undertakes; witneſs the Old Eaſt India Company, whoſe cauſe he maintained till he fixed it upon as ſure a foot as the New; even when they thought themſelves paſt recovery. He lives up to what his viſible eſtate can afford; and yet purchaſes, inſtead of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in debt. He is endued with good natural parts, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an unaccountable boldneſs; daring to ſay what he pleaſes, and will be heard out; ſo that he paſſeth with ſome for the ſhrew of the Houſe. On the Queen's acceſſion to the throne, he was made a privy-counſellor; and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of the guards and garriſons. He is a tall, thin, pale-faced man, with a very wild look; brave in his perſon, bold in expreſſing himſelf, a violent enemy, a ſure friend, and ſeems to be always in a hurry. Near fifty years old."</q> Such is the character given of this gentleman by Macky in 1703.—Mr. Howe was author of
"A Panegyric on King William," and of ſeveral little poems; and is introduced in Swift's celebrated little ballad "On the Game of Traffic:"

            <head>PART OF VIRGIL'S FOURTH GEORGICK.</head>
            <byline>BY MR. CREECH<note n="*" place="bottom">Born near Sherborne in Dorſetſhire in 1659, and bred up at the Free-ſchool in that town, under Mr. Curganven, to whom he gratefully inſcribed an Idyllium of Theocritus. He was ſent by Colonel Strangeways to Wadham College in Oxford, where he was admitted a ſcholar on the foundation 1675, and took the degree of B.A. June 13, 1683. The reputation acquired by his Lucretius, which he publiſhed when very young, recommended him to All Souls College, where he was elected Fellow in 1689; proceeded B.D. March 18, 1696; and was preſented by that College to the living of Welwyn in Hertfordſhire; but, through ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment either in love or in his expectations, laid violent hands on himſelf in 1701, before he had taken poſſeſſion of his living. "He was a man," ſays Jacob,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"of excellent parts, ſound judgement, and perfectly maſter of the Greek and Latin languages; but naturally of a moroſe temper, and too apt to deſpiſe the underſtandings and performances of others. This made him leſs eſteemed than his great merit deſerved; and his reſentments on this account fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently engaged him in thoſe heats and diſputes which in the end proved fatal to him."</q>
On his father's monument at Blandford, he is called
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The learned, much-admired, and much-envied Mr. Creech."</q>—He tranſlated Lucretius, Theocritus, and Horace; ſome eclogues of Virgil; and ſome of the ſatires of Juvenal. N.</note>.</byline>
            <argument>
               <p>Ariſtaeus, having loſt his bees, goes by his mother's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to Proteus, to know why the Gods had ſent this plague. Proteus tells him they ſent it to revenge the injury he had done Orpheus, in being the cauſe of his bride's death, and ſo goes on with the ſtory of his paſſion.</p>

               <l>The earth lay chopp'd, no ſpring ſupply'd his flood,</l>
               <l>And mid-day rays boil'd-up the ſtreams to mud:</l>

                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0771900501:244"/>When Proteus coming to his uſual cave,</l>
               <l>The ſea-calf following ſpouts the brackiſh wave:</l>
               <l>Spread o'er the ſand the ſcatter'd monſters lay,</l>
               <l>He (like a ſhepherd at the cloſe of day,</l>

               <l>Sits midſt the beach, and counts the ſcaly flock.</l>
               <l>Scarce was he laid, ſcarce ſleep had ſeal'd his eyes,</l>
               <l>When Ariſtaeus, eager to ſurprize,</l>
               <l>Invades and binds him: ſtraight he ſtarts and roars,</l>
               <l>And with ſhrill noiſes fills the echoing ſhores:</l>
               <l>He flies to his old arts, and ſtrives to 'ſcape</l>

               <l>All monſtrous forms put on, he would appear</l>
               <l>A flame, a flood, a lion, or a bear:</l>
               <l>When nought avail'd, he turn'd himſelf again;</l>
               <l>And thus ſpoke with the accent of a man:</l>

            <head>ECLOGUE,</head>
            <byline>BY LORD FALKLAND<note n="*" place="bottom">Lucius Cary, eldeſt ſon of the firſt lord viſcount of Falkland, was born about 1610; and received his academical learning firſt at Trinity College Dublin, and then at St. John's Cambridge. He entered early into the ſervice of Charles I; and was ſhot at the battle of Newbury, Sept. 20, 1643.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The character of Lord Falkland by the Earl of Clarendon is the completeſt, if not the fineſt, of any in his admirable hiſtory. He is repreſented as an aſſemblage of almoſt every virtue and excellency that can dignify or adorn a man. This encomium is doubtleſs ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated; but there ſeems to be much truth in it with reſpect to the private part of his life, as it appears to have been taken from near and repeated views. A great man in public rather appears to be what it is his intereſt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to be thought, than what he is. The Earl of Clarendon, who knew Lord Falkland in private life, ſeems therefore to have given us a juſter portrait of him than if he had ſeen him only in his public character. It muſt be acknowledged, that he has drawn him to great advantage: but we are not to impute this to the leaſt diſregard to truth, but to the amiable lights in which his friendſhip had placed him. A friend who draws the portrait of another friend, is apt to beſtow as much heightening upon it as a painter would in finiſhing the picture of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs."</q>
This extract from Mr. Granger is given without the moſt diſtant inclination of
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"throwing a ſhade on a virtue the brighteſt and pureſt that hath done honour to theſe later ages;"</q> [ſee Bp. Hurd's excellent Dialogues, vol. I. p. 78.]—Before he was twenty-three years of age, he had read over all the Greek and Latin fathers, and was inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable in collecting books of value.
He has given ſpecimens of his own abilities as a poet, a politician, and a polemic writer; but his
"Diſcourſe of the Infallibility of the Church of Rome," which is written in an eaſy and familiar ſtyle, without the leaſt affectation of learning, is the moſt conſiderable of his Works.
It is remarked by Doctor Swift, that in ſome of Lord Falkland's writings,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"when he doubted whether a word was perfectly intelligible or no, he uſed to conſult one of his lady's chambermaids (not the waiting-woman, becauſe it was poſſible ſhe might be converſant in romances), and by her judgment was guided whether to receive or reject it."</q>

            <head>ON THE DEATH OF BEN JONSON<note n="†" place="bottom">Ben Jonſon, a moſt celebrated Engliſh poet in his time, died Aug. 6, 1637, in his 63d year. He is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repreſented as ſurly and moroſe by the writers of the preſent time, though, from the attention ſhewn to him by his contemporaries, it might be ſuſpected that the charge was not well founded. Certain it is that he died much lamented; and in the beginning of 1638 his memory was embalmed by the tears of the Muſes, in a collection of elegies and poems under the title of
"Jonſonius Virbius, or The Memorie of Ben Jonſon revived by the Friends of the Muſes."
In this collection were poems by moſt of the men of genius of that age. One by Mr. Waller is in his Poems, p. 104; another by Cartwright in this volume, p. 63.

He took the degrees of B. and M.A, and was preſented by the College to the livings of Caſſington and Pyrton in Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. In the civil wars he preached before the king at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and was made D.D.; but was ſoon after ejected from his livings by Cromwell's viſitors. He found an aſylum with the Earl of Devonſhire; and at the Reſtoration obtained his livings again, was made canon of Chriſt Church, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Chicheſter, and chaplain to Charles II. He died December 6, 1672; and is called by Wood
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"a quaint preacher and a noted poet."</q>
Five only of his ſermons are in print, and his poems are not numerous. He publiſhed two plays; a poem on the Naval Victory over the Dutch by the Duke of York; tranſlated ſome of Lucian's Dialogues, 1638; and Donne's Latin Epigrams, 1652, which he called
"A Sheaf of Miſcellany Epigrams."
Though very orthodox in his opinions, and ſevere in his manners, he was a facetious companion, and his propenſity to mirth attended him in his laſt moments; for to a ſervant who had lived long with him
he
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"bequeathed a trunk, with ſomething in it to make him drink;"</q> which being opened by the expecting ſervant, he found the legacy to be nothing but a red herring.

            <head>THYRSIS'S PRAISE TO HIS MISTRESS.</head>
            <byline>BY MR. WILLIAM BROWNE<note n="*" place="bottom">An excellent writer, whoſe fate was as uncommon as it was unmerited. He who was admired and beloved by all the beſt writers of his time, who was eſteemed and highly recommended by the critical Jonſon and the learned Selden, was in a few years after his death almoſt forgotten. To the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſmall credit of Mr. T. Davies, his writings were for the firſt time completely collected in 1772, in three neat volumes, of a ſize which makes them a proper companion for the "Engliſh Poets," and conſequently renders it unneceſſary to print here any more than a ſpecimen of his poetry. But a few particulars of his life ſhall be given in the words of Mr. Davies:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"William Browne, deſcended of a good family, was born at Taviſtock in Devonſhire, in the year 1590; his father, according to Prince, in his "Worthies of Devon," being probably of the knightly family of Browne, of Browne's-Ilaſh, in the pariſh of Langtree, near Great-Torrington. After he had paſſed through the Grammar-ſchool, he was ſent to Exeter College in the Univerſity of Oxford, about the beginning of the reign of king James the Firſt, where he became a great proficient in claſſical learning, and in the Belles Lettres was ſcarcely equalled; from hence, however, before he had taken any academical degree, he removed to the Inner-Temple, London, where he more particularly devoted himſelf to the Muſes. In the beginning of the year 1624, he returned again to Exeter College, and became tutor to Robert Dormer, who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards earl of Carnarvon, and who loſt his life at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Fight, on the 20th of September, 1643. On the 25th of March, 1624, our author received permiſſion to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally created a Maſter of Arts, although the degree was not conferred upon him till the November following. He is ſtyled, in the public regiſter of the Univerſity, a man well ſkilled in all kinds of polite literature and uſeful arts; <hi>vir omni humanâ literaturâ et bonarum artium cognitione in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructus.</hi> After he had left College with his pupil, he was gladly received into the family of William earl of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, who had a great reſpect for him; and here, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the author of the Athenae Oxonienſes, he made his fortune ſo well that he purchaſed an eſtate; he alſo adds, that he had a great mind in a little body; but with regard to the time of his death, he is very doubtful, for all that he ſays of the matter is, that in his ſearches he finds that one William Browne, of Ottery St. Mary in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire, died in the year 1645; but that he cannot tell whether he was the ſame with our poet."</q>
To this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I ſhall only add that Mr. Warburton the herald ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been poſſeſſed of ſome MS. poems by this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which were ſold, with the reſt of his library, about the year 1759 or 1760. I cannot but wiſh that Mr. Davies had met with ſufficient encouragement to have proceeded with the work he announced at the concluſion of his preface, under the title of "England's Helicon." He publiſhed, however, in the ſame ſize, the whole works of Suckling, in 1770, the poems of Marvell and Carew in 1772; and thoſe of Sir John Davies in 1773. A ſmall portion, therefore, of each of theſe writers will be ſufficient for this collection. N.</note>.</byline>

JOHN SELDEN<note n="*" place="bottom">This famous antiquary, deſcended from a good family, was born at Salvington in Suſſex, December 16, 1585; edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated at Chicheſter free-ſchool, and admitted of Hart-Hall, Oxon, in 1598; removed to Clifford's Inn in 1602, to ſtudy the law; admitted of the Inner Temple in May 1604. He ſoon commenced writer; and publiſhed a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of valuable works, which it is needleſs here to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. In 1612 he publiſhed notes and illuſtrations on the firſt eighteen ſongs in
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"his worthy friend Michael Dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's"</q>
Poly-Olbion, and the year after wrote verſes in Greek, Latin, and Engliſh, upon Browne's
"Britannia's Paſtorals;" which, with divers poems prefixed to the works of other authors, occaſioned Sir John Suckling to give him a place in his "Seſſion of the Poets."
Mr. Selden, when not above three and thirty years of age, had ſhewn himſelf a great philologiſt, ant'quary, herald, and linguiſt; and his name was ſo wonderfully advanced, not only at home, but in foreign countries, that he was actually then, what he was afterwards uſually ſtyled, the great dictator of learning to the Engliſh nation. In 1618, when he was in his thirty-fourth year, he publiſhed his "Hiſtory of Tithes;" which alarming the clergy, and offending king James I, it was ſuppreſſed, and the author forced to make public ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. He again offended that monarch in 1621, by an opinion he gave againſt the crown as counſel in the houſe of lords, and was committed into the cuſtody of the ſheriff of London; but was releaſed in five weeks by the favour of the lord keeper Williams. He was choſen member for Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter that year; but neglected all public buſineſs to apply himſelf to ſtudy. In 1624 he was appointed, by the Inner Temple, reader at Lyon's Inn; but refuſed to accept that office. In 1625 he was choſen burgeſs for Great Bedwin, Wiltſhire, and again in 1626, when he was an active ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager againſt the duke of Buckingham. In 1627 he was counſel for Mr. Hampden; and in the third parliament of king James was again elected for Lancaſter, and had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable hand in the Petition of Rights. After the proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in June, retiring to Wreſt in Bedfordſhire, he finiſhed his Commentaries on the Arundelian Marbles. In the next ſeſſion he warmly oppoſed the court, and was committed to the Tower, and had his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dy ſealed up, March 24, 1628. He was cloſely confined three months, but magnificently ſupported at the king's expence; and being afterwards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the uſe of ſuch books as he deſired, he proceeded in his ſtudies. In Hilary Term, 1629, declining to give ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for his good behaviour (as unwarrantable by law), he was committed to the King's Ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h priſon. He was releaſed the latter end of the year, though it does not appear how; only that the parliament in 1646 ordered him £.5000. for the loſſes he had ſuſtained on that occaſion. In 1630 he was again committed to cuſtody, with the earls of Bedford and Clare, Sir Robert Cotton, and Mr. St. John, being accuſed of having diſperſed a libel, intituled,
"A Propoſition for his Majeſty's ſervice to bridle the impertinency of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;" but it was proved that Sir Robert Dudley, their living in the duke of Tuſcany's dominions, was the author.
All theſe various impriſonments and tumults gave no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to his ſtudies; but he proceeded, in his old way, to write and publiſh books. In 1640 he was choſen member of parliament for the Univerſity of Oxford; and though he was againſt the court, yet in 1642 the king had thoughts of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeal from the lord keeper Littleton, and giving it to him. In 1643 he was appointed one of the lay-members to ſit in the aſſembly of divines at Weſtminſter, in which he frequently perplexed thoſe divines with his vaſt learning. About this time he took the covenant; and the ſame year, 1643, was by the parliament appointed keeper of the records in the Tower. In 1644 he was elected one of the twelve commiſſioners of the Admiralty; and the ſame year was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated to the maſterſhip of Trinity College in Cambridge, which he did not think proper to accept. In the beginning of 1653 his health began to decline; and he died the 30th of November that year, at the Friary Houſe in White-Friars, where he had reſided for ſome years, being poſſeſſed of it in the right of Elizabeth counte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He left a moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and curious library to his executors; which they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly would have beſtowed on the ſociety of the Inner Temple, if a proper place had been provided to receive it; but, this being neglected, they gave it to the Univerſity of Oxford. A good edition of his Works was publiſhed by Dr. Wilkins, 1726, in three volumes, folio. N.</note>.</byline>

            <byline>BY DR. BATHURST<note n="*" place="bottom">Preſident of Trinity College, Oxford, and vice-chancellor of that Univerſity.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Dr. Bathurſt, in the early part of his life, applied himſelf to the ſtudy of divinity, in which he made a very conſiderable progreſs. But when he ſaw that ſome churches were defaced or demoliſhed, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into barracks and ſtables, and that a learned mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry was held in the utmoſt contempt, he changed the courſe of his ſtudies, and applied himſelf to phyſic. He took a doctor's degree in that faculty, in which he roſe to ſuch eminence, that he was, in the time of the Uſurpation, appointed phyſician to the ſtate. Upon the Reſtoration, he quitted his profeſſion of phyſic, was elected a fell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His learning and talents were various: he was the orator and the poet, the philoſopher and the divine. He poſſeſſed an inexhauſtible fund of writ, and was the facetious companion at eighty years of age. Ridicule was the weapon that he made uſe of to correct the deliquents of his college; and he was ſo abſolute a maſter of it, that he had it always at hand. His poetical pieces in the "Muſae Anglicanae" are excellent in their kind: they are much in the ſpirit of Ovid, who was his favourite poet. His "Diatribae Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicae" in manuſcript, which he began at twenty-three years of age, are much commended by Mr. Warton. He died greatly lamented by all that knew his worth, and particularly by the ſociety over which he preſided, the 14th of June, 1704, in the 84th year of his age."</q>

            <head>VERSES</head>
            <byline>BY GEORGE CHAPMAN<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This writer, who obtained much applauſe in his time, and was greatly praiſed by his contemporaries, was born at Hitching-hill, in the county of Hertford, ſome time in the year 1557. After being well grounded in ſchool-learning, he was ſent to the Univerſity, but whether to Oxford or Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge was unknown to Anthony Wood, who declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf certain he reſided ſome time at the former, where he was obſerved to be moſt excellent in the Latin and Greek tongues, but not in Logic or Philoſophy, which may be preſumed to be the reaſon he took no degree there. He appears to have been a man of a very reſpectable character, being countenanced and patronized by ſeveral eminent perſons, particularly Sir Thomas Walſyngham and his ſon, and by Prince Henry, ſon of James the Firſt. Wood imagines that he was a ſworn ſervant either to James the Firſt or his Queen, and ſays he was highly valued, but not ſo much as Ben Jonſon. The ſame writer adds, that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he was a perſon of moſt reverend aſpect, religious and temperate qualities, rarely meeting in a poet."</q>
After living to the age of 77 years, he died on the 12th day of May, 1634, in the pariſh of St. Giles in the Fields, and was buried on the South-ſide of the Church-yard there. His friend Inigo Jones erected a monument to his memory near the place of his interment. His tranſlation of Homer acquired him a conſiderable degree of reputation. Mr. Dryden tells us, that Waller uſed to ſay he never could read it without incredible tranſport. It is much cenſured by Mr. Pope, who, notwithſtanding, acknowledges that there is a daring, fiery ſpirit, which animates it, ſomething like what one might imagine Homer himſelf would have writ before he arrived at years of diſcretion. He tranſlated alſo the Batrachomyomachia, and all the Hymns of Homer, to which he annexed the verſes here printed; finiſhed Marlow's Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Muſaeus; produced ſeveral original Poems, and ſome other Tranſlations; was the author of ſeventeen dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick performances, and aſſiſted Shirley in two others. For this note I am indebted to the new edition of Dodſley's Old Plays, vol. IV. p. 113. where the reader will find ſome other curious particulars of Chapman, and an exact liſt of his dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick writings.</p>
                  <p>Of the Batrachomyomachia and Hymns, I have the copy preſented to Lord Ruſſel, with the following MS. dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:

            </head>
            <byline>BY SIR JOHN DAVIES<note n="*" place="bottom">Son of a wealthy tanner of Chiſgrove in Wiltſhire, and born there about 1569; commoner of Queen's College, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, in Michaelmas term 1583. When he had taken the degree of B.A. he removed to the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar. Being expelled thence on account of a quarrel, he returned to Oxford. He was afterwards rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated in the Temple, practiſed as a barriſter, and was choſen a burgeſs in the parliament held at Weſtminſter in 1601. Upon the death of Queen Elizabeth, our author went with Lord Hunſdon into Scotland, to congratulate King James. That prince was learned himſelf, and a great encourager of learned men; when Hunſdon and his retinue were admitted into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The king preſently after promoted him to the office of ſolicitor and then attorney-general in Ireland, where in 1606 he was made ſerjeant at law, and afterwards ſpeaker of the houſe of commons in that kingdom; the year following he received the order of knighthood from the king at Whitehall. In the year 1612 he publiſhed a very valuable book, called,
"A Diſcovery of the true Cauſes why Ireland was never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubdued, nor brought under obedience of the Crown of England, until the beginning of his Majeſty's happy Reign;" reprinted in 12mo, 1747.
Sir John, in 1612, quitted Ireland, and was made one of his majeſty's Engliſh ſerjeants at law. After his ſettling in England he was often appointed one of the judges of aſſize in the circuits. He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Eleanor Tonchet, youngeſt daughter of George, Lord Audley, by whom he had a ſon an ideot, who died young, and a daughter named Lucy, married to Ferdinand, Lord Haſtings, afterwards Earl of Huntingdon. In 1626 Sir John was appointed Lord Chief Juſtice of the King's Bench; but, before the ceremony of his inſtallation could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he died ſuddenly of an apoplexy, the 7th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at his houſe in the Strand, in the 57th year of his age. Sir John Davies, beſides his Poems and his Account of the reduction of Ireland before-mentioned, publiſhed reports and other books relating to the conſtitution and laws of this kingdom. Anthony Wood ſays, there were ſeveral of his manuſcripts on various ſubjects, which were formerly in the library of Sir James Ware, and ſince that in the poſſeſſion of Edward Earl of Clarendon; beſides theſe, which were chiefly of the political kind, the ſame author ſays there were alſo ſome epigrams written by Sir John, and a metaphraſe of ſeveral of King David's Pſalms, but never publiſhed. The poem on the Soul, which he called Noſce Teipſum, was firſt publiſhed in 1599, and afterwards in 1622 with Hymns to Aſtrea in acroſtic verſe; and Orcheſtra, a poem expreſſing the antiquity and excellence of dancing, in a dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Penelope and one of her wooers, containing one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty-one ſtanzas unfiniſhed.

            <head>DETRACTION EXECRATED.</head>
            <byline>BY SIR JOHN SUCKLING<note n="*" place="bottom">A poet of great vivacity and ſome elegance, and one of the fineſt gentlemen of his time. He was ſon to Sir John Suckling, comptroller of the houſhold to king Charles the Firſt; and was born at Witham in Eſſex in 1613. He ſpoke Latin at five years of age, and wrote it when nine. He had a general knowledge of polite literature; but applied himſelf more particularly to muſic and poetry. In the courſe of his foreign travels, he made a campaign under Guſtavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus; and, at his return, raiſed a ſplendid troop of horſe, at the expence of twelve thouſand pounds, for the ſervice of the king. This troop, with Sir John at its head, behaved ſo ill in the engagement with the Scots, upon the Engliſh borders, in 1639, as to occaſion the famous lampoon by Sir John Mennis, "Sir John he got him an ambling nag," &amp;c. which was ſet to an Iriſh tune, and much ſung by the Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. This diſaſtrous exped<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion, and the ridicule that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, was ſuppoſed to have haſtened his death, which happened in 1641, at the age of twenty-eight. His proſe writings, particularly his "Diſcourſe of Religion," addreſſed to lord Dorſet, are thought equal to the beſt of his poetical performances. His ballad on a wedding, and his
"Seſſion of the Poets," are oftener remembered than any of his works.
This ballad was occaſioned by the marriage of Roger Boyle, the firſt earl of Orrery, with lady Margaret Howard, daughter of the earl of Suffolk. There was a great intimacy betwixt Sir John and the earl of Orrery, then lord Broghill. In his "Seſſion of the Poets," he has given us ſome traits of the characters of his poetical brethren. This article is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally compiled from Jacob and Granger. The whole of Sir John Suckling's Works, containing his
"Poems, Letters, and Plays," were publiſhed ſeveral times by Mr. Tonſon; and in two neat volumes, by Mr. Davies, 1770.

            <head>SONG,</head>
            <byline>BY THOMAS CAREW<note n="*" place="bottom">Thomas Carew, a poet of real elegance, was a younger ſon of the family of the Carews in Devonſhire. He was born in 1589; and after receiving ſome part of his education at Corpus Chriſti College, Oxford, he ſpent many years in France and Italy. Returning from travel, he followed the court, which, ſays Lord Clarendon,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"the modeſty of that time diſpoſed men to do ſome time, before they pretended to be of it; and he was very much eſteemed by the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons in the court, and well looked upon by the King himſelf, ſome years before he could obtain to be Sewer to the King; and when the King conferred that place upon him it was not without the regret even of the whole Scotch nation, which united themſelves in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending another gentleman to it; and of ſo great value were thoſe relations held in that age, when majeſty was beheld with the reverence it ought to be."</q>
Wood, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Oxford Biographer, ſays that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he was adored by the poets of his time"</q>
Which ſeems to be true, as we well know that his admirers were the firſt men of the age; that Montague, the Lord Abbot of Pontois, careſſed him; that Donne, D' Avenant, and May, loved him. Suckling too admired him; and yet, in his Seſſion of the Poets, ſays,
<q>
                     <l>" Tom Carew came next, but he had a fault</l>
                     <l>" That would not well ſtand with a Laureat;</l>
                     <l>" His Muſe was hide-bound, and the iſſue of 's brain</l>
                     <l>" Was ſeldom brought forth but with trouble and pain."</l>
                  </q>
Suckling knew otherwiſe: but we muſt remember, that the poet, when he wrote this, was writing a ſatire. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of his love-ſonnets made them familiar to his Majeſty and his nobles; they were ſought after, read, and rehearſed; and by his Majeſty's command were ſet to muſic, or (as Wood expreſſes it) wedded to the charming notes of Mr. Henry Lawes, who was gentleman of the King's chapel, and at that time the greateſt muſical compoſer in England. Lord Clarendon ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Carew was a perſon of a pleaſant and face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious wit, and made many poems (eſpecially in the amorous way) which, for the ſharpneſs of the fancy, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of the language in which that fancy was ſpread, were at leaſt equal, if not ſuperior, to any of that time: but his glory was, that after fifty years of his life had been ſpent with leſs ſeverity or exactneſs than it ought to have been, he died with the greateſt remorſe for that licenſe, and with the greateſt manifeſtation of Chriſtianity that his beſt friends could deſire."</q>
He died in the year 1639. I have already mentioned that his poems were publiſhed in 1772 by Mr. Davies. N.</note>, ESQ.</byline>
