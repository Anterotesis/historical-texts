            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>What all muſt confeſs to be rare,</l>
               <l>A female ſtill cheerful, and faithful and kind,</l>

               <l>Overſpread with its branches, and ſhade;</l>
               <l>Whoſe cluſters appear more tranſparent and fine,</l>
               <l>As its leaves are beginning to fade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load,</l>
               <l>In our orchard ſurrounded with pales;</l>
               <l>In a bed of clean ſtraw let our apples be ſtow'd,</l>
               <l>For a tart that in winter regales.</l>

               <l>When the vapours that riſe from the earth in the morn</l>
               <l>Seem to hang on its ſurface like ſmoke,</l>
               <l>'Till diſpers'd by the ſun that gilds over the corn,</l>

               <l>Heaven grant we may not of their labour partake;</l>

            <head>THE THEORY OF TEARS;</head>
            <head type="sub">A FRAGMENT.</head>
            <byline>BY WILLIAM STEVENSON, ESQ.</byline>

               <l>TEars, which the bar-rang'd orators command,</l>
               <l>Are tears of pleaſure for the fee in hand;</l>
               <l>The greater this, the more abundant thoſe,</l>
               <l>Rated by price, as wine by meaſure flows.</l>
               <l>But wines a due hilarity impart,</l>
               <l>Their tears add gladneſs to the heavy heart.</l>
               <l>Grief, when ſincere, by no vain proof appears,</l>
               <l>Too vaſt for the parade of formal tears.</l>
               <l>So, in the ſkies when deep-charg'd thunders brew,</l>
               <l>No clouds deſcend in rain, or melt in dew.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>On Tully's words when liſtening ſenates hung,</l>
               <l>Charm'd by the living magic of his tongue,</l>
               <l>Few tears ſuffic'd; for tears then learn'd to flow</l>
               <l>Leſs at the call of lucre than of woe.</l>
               <l>Once from the offer'd hand your fee withdraw,</l>
               <l>That key which opes the cabinet of law;</l>
               <l>Tears then no more ſhall their full ſluices break,</l>
               <l>Nor eyes amid the dew of rhetoric—ſpeak:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0579800309:54"/>Thus, when the ſky a gloom of vapours ſhrouds,</l>
               <l>Thunders would mutter words thro' watery clouds.</l>
               <l>Alike ſo far, each here the verſe confines,</l>
               <l>That both are empty marks, and paſſive ſigns;</l>
               <l>Theſe, from the touch of flames etherial roll'd,</l>
               <l>Thoſe, from the no leſs ſubtile touch of gold.</l>
               <l>This maxim then how much the truth beyond,</l>
               <l>" Hearts muſt with eyes for ever correſpond:"</l>
               <l>Reverſe the adage, and behold it true,</l>
               <l>If you mankind thro' no falſe optics view.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The doctor's tears, if doctors weep at all,</l>
               <l>That ſoon his patient will recover, fall.</l>
               <l>Each ſalient vein, that vibrates ſtill to health,</l>
               <l>Beats in repugnance to the pulſe of wealth.</l>
               <l>Each ſign, that to a happy criſis tends,</l>
               <l>A tear reſiſtleſs to its orbit ſends.</l>
               <l>But here the pointed ſatire fain would ſtop,</l>
               <l>Joy too, like ſorrow, boaſts her pearly drop.</l>
               <l>From fleecy clouds, on which the ſun-beam plays,</l>
               <l>Oft falls the dew-ſhower interſpers'd with rays:</l>
               <l>Let Candor then, who ſcorns the partial plan,</l>
               <l>Sometimes miſtake the doctor for a man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>" All hope is gone! ſee how the doctor cries,</l>
               <l>" His tears, ah! ſpeak in ſilence from his eyes!</l>
               <l>" Good, tender man!—But ſay, dear doctor, ſay,</l>
               <l>" Is it too certain what your looks betray?</l>
               <l>" Has Phyſic now no laſt reſource to try?</l>
               <l>" And muſt the ſweet, the lovely patient—die?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0579800309:55"/>" But ſure the dire diſeaſe, in luckleſs hour,</l>
               <l>" O'er youth and ſtrength can ſcarcely boaſt the power;</l>
               <l>" Not yet attain'd the fever's wonted height,</l>
               <l>" To make our noon-day hopes all ſet in night."</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>" No! heaven be prais'd!" with fervor-lifted eyes,</l>
               <l>" My tears are tears of joy," the doctor cries;</l>
               <l>" No more the fever's heats internal burn,</l>
               <l>" No more deliriums, big with fate, return.</l>
               <l>" Mix thoſe few cordials, and your fears abate,</l>
               <l>" Our patient's in a convaleſcent ſtate."</l>
               <l>Short triumph! his lank purſe ſo empty felt,</l>
               <l>Each eye would fain from other motives melt.</l>
               <l>Now certain hopes health's kind prognoſtics give;</l>
               <l>So ſoon cur'd patients, how ſhall doctors live?</l>
               <l>Men muſt debauch, take fevers, faint and rave,</l>
               <l>Few hopes attend them, and late periods ſave;</l>
               <l>Their fatal ſnares muſt wine and women ſpread,</l>
               <l>Or doctors go a begging for their bread.</l>
               <l>But uſeleſs is the hint, if meant as ſuch,</l>
               <l>Mankind are ſure too complaiſant by much,</l>
               <l>To ſuffer thoſe, who kindly them preſerve</l>
               <l>From fell diſeaſe, and death itſelf, to ſtarve.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now to the pulpit turns the muſe's eye,</l>
               <l>There, haply, tears from proper fonts to ſpy;</l>
               <l>For ſure, if ſuch us any where o'ertake,</l>
               <l>Altho' with-held for friendſhip's preſſing ſake,</l>
               <l>Tho' rarely found in roſtrums; it muſt be</l>
               <l>Where God deſcends, and mortals bend the knee.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0579800309:56"/>Where tears ſincere, in heaven's pure eye, diſcloſe</l>
               <l>A finer twinkle than the diamond ſhows.</l>
               <l>Where all confeſs, a tale that ſtill begins,</l>
               <l>How much Religion ſuffers by their ſins.</l>
               <l>Religion! that ſublime and gracious plan,</l>
               <l>By which for angel we exchange the man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But hold—all honour to the ſacred gown,</l>
               <l>Tho' leſs rever'd the gem-encircled crown.</l>
               <l>A ſcoff contemptuous here, or laugh of ſcorn,</l>
               <l>Were Virtue to decry, celeſtial-born;</l>
               <l>Were to defame the volume of the ſkies,</l>
               <l>Which, penn'd by hand divine, expanded lies:</l>
               <l>Far more, for devils act leſs monſtrous parts,</l>
               <l>Were to eraze God's image from our hearts:</l>
               <l>Degrade the gown, religion, and the text,</l>
               <l>You muſt, dread thought! dethrone Jehovah next.</l>
               <l>The perſon from the office we divide,</l>
               <l>To ſhun the ſtigma, or of guilt or pride;</l>
               <l>Pride, that betrays a littleneſs of mind,</l>
               <l>And guilt, indeed, of an enormous kind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Tears, guſhing forth, the parſon's ſight bedim,</l>
               <l>His eyes, like ſtars in miſts, uncertain ſwim;</l>
               <l>Nor wonder tears his cautious lids beguile,</l>
               <l>For oh! the melting pathos of his ſtile!</l>
               <l>Who can behold him, and refrain from tears,</l>
               <l>None, but the marble-hearted wretch who—hears.</l>
               <l>His head, his heart, his eyes, all correſpond,</l>
               <l>Like mutual friends, of one another fond.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0579800309:57"/>But, had he been from ſelf-complacence freed,</l>
               <l>His head, his heart, his eyes, had diſagreed.</l>
               <l>Not joy, but grief, in tears had then indulg'd,</l>
               <l>Expreſs'd her feelings, and her doubts divulg'd.</l>
               <l>This vain parade of partial tears is ſhown,</l>
               <l>Becauſe the preacher's to himſelf unknown.</l>
               <l>In big effuſive conſciouſneſs they run,</l>
               <l>For what his pen, not wicked heart, has done.</l>
               <l>His pen's the ſinner; nor leſs oddly true,</l>
               <l>His pen's the generous expiator too.</l>
               <l>Yet, ſtranger ſtill! dry eyes had ſhown his ſenſe,</l>
               <l>Had he ſurpriz'd his pen in one offence.</l>
               <l>What could he, all awake to feeling, more,</l>
               <l>Had he himſelf been faulty o'er and o'er?</l>
               <l>For acting ill (who can in all excel?)</l>
               <l>Sure heaven will pardon him for writing well.</l>
               <l>His ſins, indeed, are multiplied he owns,</l>
               <l>As are his flock's, which hourly he bemoans;</l>
               <l>But ſay, ye adepts, how things fit to call,</l>
               <l>Has not his quill all-potent cancell'd all?</l>
               <l>But this, not nature's, but the preacher's law,</l>
               <l>No tears can once but ſacerdotal draw:</l>
               <l>Hence, tho' the rapt ſelf-conſcious parſon weeps,</l>
               <l>No ſocial tear a well-bred cadence keeps;</l>
               <l>Or, if a courteous drop with his conſents,</l>
               <l>The cheek alone, but not the heart, relents:</l>
               <l>They weep, becauſe they ſee, but liſten not,</l>
               <l>Or, if they heard, the ſubſtance all forgot.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0579800309:58"/>Thus womens eyes abundant uſe to flow,</l>
               <l>Aſk them the reaſon why?—they do not know.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But ſhall coarſe ſatire quite engroſs the page,</l>
               <l>And thro' the numbers ſpend its gloomy rage?</l>
               <l>No; let ſome gentle ſubject cloſe the ſong,</l>
               <l>To the ſoft paſſions ſofter ſtrains belong.</l>
               <l>The muſe increaſing ardors too may feel,</l>
               <l>And kindle onward like a chariot-wheel.</l>
               <l>But not, as chariots raiſe the duſt around,</l>
               <l>Truth to obſcure, or reaſon to confound.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Tears are the eye's pellucid dews, that fall</l>
               <l>At Pity's ſummons, or at Mercy's call;</l>
               <l>Tho' ruthleſs eyes oft-times affect them too,</l>
               <l>As ſtones themſelves diſtil a breathing dew.</l>
               <l>As ſprings to earth, all-gently they impart</l>
               <l>A kindly genial ſoftneſs to the heart.</l>
               <l>Tears, when the mind enjoys unruffled eaſe,</l>
               <l>For form-ſake ſhed, or from deſire to pleaſe,</l>
               <l>Are like thoſe rains thro' ſunſhine oft ſent down</l>
               <l>From partial clouds, when nature wears no frown.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Tears are the ſpecial meſſengers akin</l>
               <l>To oracles, on errands from within;</l>
               <l>To tell mankind, beyond conjectures vain,</l>
               <l>Thoſe ſecrets friendſhip only can explain;</l>
               <l>What active paſſions riſe in tender ſtrife,</l>
               <l>What ſoft affections touch the ſprings of life.</l>
               <l>Tears are the ſilent language of the heart,</l>
               <l>That more, far more, than empty ſounds impart:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0579800309:59"/>By which it loves, o'erburden'd, to complain,</l>
               <l>When words would but offend, or prove in vain.</l>
               <l>Tears eaſe the ſoul in anguiſh and deſpair,</l>
               <l>Leaving a ſadly-pleaſing languor there.</l>
               <l>Thus cloſe-pent clouds diſſolve in haſty ſhowers,</l>
               <l>By which the thunder loſes all its powers;</l>
               <l>By which the ſky, far as the view unfolds,</l>
               <l>A temperature ſerene and ſoften'd holds.</l>
               <l>Tears are the gentle ſtreams that off convey</l>
               <l>Thoſe floods that would o'erwhelm us by delay;</l>
               <l>The heart's big ſwell, much by misfortunes griev'd,</l>
               <l>That heaving ſoon would burſt if not reliev'd.</l>
               <l>Tears are the tender proofs of love ſincere,</l>
               <l>In ſilence ſhed, whence no reports take air:</l>
               <l>Shed, as the tribute of congenial minds,</l>
               <l>While each a more than vulgar tranſport finds.</l>
               <l>Falſe eyes, indeed, may weep, if fame divulge,</l>
               <l>But true affection only can indulge.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Tears are the debt in pearly drops convey'd,</l>
               <l>But more than pearls in price, to merit paid;</l>
               <l>In which none act the baſe inſolvent's part,</l>
               <l>But thoſe whom Nature form'd without a heart.</l>
               <l>Tears wait on vice, and oft on virtue too,</l>
               <l>As winter-clouds diſſolve in ſummer-dew.</l>
               <l>Tears, tho' the cheek a partial mark retain,</l>
               <l>Waſh out, if ſhed aright, a fouler ſtain;</l>
               <l>Which, as it fainter and more faint appears,</l>
               <l>Makes angels envy human-kind their tears.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0579800309:60"/>
               <l>Tears are the ſilent arguments to tell</l>
               <l>That man's immortal, tho' at firſt he fell.</l>
               <l>Immortal—for he weeps for joy oft-times,</l>
               <l>Free from the ſting of recollected crimes.</l>
               <l>And what can Nature's law thus counteract?</l>
               <l>What thus ſenſation's ſprings revers'd affect?</l>
               <l>O! thought ſublime! ſtrong proofs inculcate hence,</l>
               <l>How much inferior to the mind the ſenſe;</l>
               <l>Diſſolv'd in tears, that feebly it reflects</l>
               <l>Back to the ſoul what rapturous ſhe expects.</l>
               <l>As Cynthia, tho' in full-orb'd glory bright,</l>
               <l>But faintly repreſents her parent light:</l>
               <l>Thus men infer, the ſoul ſuperior muſt</l>
               <l>Exiſt apart, when duſt returns to duſt.</l>
               <l>For if the body impotent withſtands</l>
               <l>Thoſe tranſports ſhe to infinite demands,</l>
               <l>Reaſon dare promiſe her deſires immenſe,</l>
               <l>As virtue's long-expected recompence;</l>
               <l>But when, or where, 'tis not for man to know,</l>
               <l>That full enjoyment ſenſe can ne'er beſtow;</l>
               <l>When matter lives in various forms no more,</l>
               <l>And all the farce of human life is o'er.</l>

               <l>With reverence we our father's years explore,</l>

            <l>Thy preſence, either in the ſculptur'd dome,</l>

                  <l>A correſponding amity began,</l>
                  <l>And both were wedded by the care of man,</l>
                  <l>When long they liv'd in amorous friendſhip join'd,</l>

                  <l>So fares it in the end with man and wife!</l>
                  <l>Our froward dames are often out of joint,</l>

                  <l>Each had her own department—Lady Silk</l>

                  <l>She claim'd the mantua-making, as her trade,</l>

               <l>Of travels, which I hope you'll burn all,</l>

               <l>High-Barnet paſs'd, we reach the plain,</l>

            <head>TO THE MEMORY OF THE LATE DUKE OF BRIDGEWATER, MDCCXLVIII.</head>
            <byline>BY N. COTTON, M.D. OF ST. ALBAN'S.</byline>
            <l>PAtient to hear, and bounteous to beſtow,</l>
            <l>A mind that melted at another's woe;</l>
            <l>Studious to act the ſelf-approving part,</l>
            <l>That midnight muſic of the honeſt heart;</l>
            <l>Theſe ſilent joys th' illuſtrious youth poſſeſt,</l>
            <l>This cloudleſs ſunſhine of th' unſullied breaſt:</l>
            <l>From pride of peerage, and from folly free;</l>
            <l>Life's early morn fair Virtue gave to thee.</l>
            <l>The tear no longer ſtole from Sorrow's eye,</l>
            <l>And Poverty rejoic'd, when he was nigh;</l>
            <l>Like Titus, knew the value of a day,</l>
            <l>And Want went ſmiling from his gates away.</l>
            <l>Titles and rank are borrow'd from the throne:</l>
            <l>Thoſe honours, Egerton, were all thy own.</l>

                  <l>Near this place is interr'd</l>
                  <l>Theodore, king of Corſica,</l>
                  <l>Who died in this pariſh, Dec. 11, 1756.</l>
                  <l>Immediately after</l>
                  <l>Leaving the King's Bench priſon,</l>
                  <l>By the benefit of the act of inſolvency:</l>
                  <l>In conſequence of which</l>
                  <l>He reſigned his kingdom of Corſica</l>
                  <l>For the uſe of his creditors.</l>

               <l>THE grave, great teacher, to a level brings</l>
               <l>Heroes and beggars, galley-ſlaves and kings;</l>
               <l>But Theodore this moral learn'd, ere dead;</l>
               <l>Fate pour'd its leſſons on his living head,</l>
               <l>Beſtow'd a kingdom, but denied him bread.</l>
