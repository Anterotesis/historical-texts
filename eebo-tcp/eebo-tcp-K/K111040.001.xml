            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Pity, and a Hand open as Day for melting Charity, without any ſiniſter
Views; and who has happily united the Fine Gentleman to the Good
Chriſtian.</p>

<q> 
                  <l>By Way of filling,</l> 
                  <l>To raiſe their Volume's Price a Shilling.</l>
               </q> As a
moſt eminent Poet is ſaid to have done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0095100801:5"/>I own, if the Merit of any Writer is to be
judged by the Number of Sheets they have written, I have very little Pretence
to Favour: But as 
<q> 
                  <l>Multum in Parvo,</l>
               </q> is an Expreſſion of an ancient
Poet, I hope my Readers will excuſe me, as I would rather have them riſe
from Table with an Appetite, than glut them; a Rule of Temperance equally
conducive to the Health of our Minds as of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>I once had the Misfortune of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for a Printer, who never
exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the Merit of the Work, but uſed to meaſure it, and tell me, it
would not do at all, except I could ſend him half a Dozen Yards more of the
ſame Stuff: And, as Dr. <hi>Young</hi> remarks, on large Folios, well gilt
and bound, <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0095100801:6"/> very proper to adorn a Library, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the
Owner of it can read or write, or not: 
<q> 
                  <l>So <hi>Tonſon,</hi> turn'd Upholſterer, ſends home</l>

            <p>If I am obliged to ſend my Work in a blue Paper Covering, let
them look on the Inſide, which, I flatter myſelf, will at leaſt amuſe
them.</p>
            <p>As I wrote theſe Memoirs in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the deſcribing
particular Places or Cuſtoms peculiar to <hi>Ireland,</hi> in order to make
the Work intelligible to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Readers, will, I hope, be
excuſed; for all Countries vary from each other in many Points.</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. <hi>PILKINGTON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALTHO' it has been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practice, with Writers of Memoirs,
to fill their Volumes with their own Praiſes, which, whatever Pleaſure they
may have afforded to the Authors, by indulging their Vanity, are ſeldom found
to give any to the Readers; I am determined to quit this beaten Track; and by a
ſtrict Adherence to Truth, pleaſe even my greateſt Enemies, by
preſenting them with a lively Picture of all my <hi>Faults,</hi> 
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0095100801:9"/> my <hi>Follies,</hi> and the <hi>Misfortunes,</hi> which
have been conſequential to them.</p>
            <p>And I am the more inclined to proceed, in that I think the Story
may be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the <hi>Female</hi> Part of my Readers, to teach them
that <hi>Reputation</hi> 
               <q> 
                  <l>Is the immediate Jewel of their Souls,</l> 
                  <l>And that the Loſs of it</l> 
                  <l>Will make them poor indeed!</l>
                  <bibl>Othello.</bibl>
               </q> So
that I propoſe myſelf, not as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, but a Warning to them; that by
my Fall, they may ſtand the more ſecure.</p>
            <p>However numerous my Miſtakes in Life have been, they have
ſtill had moſt ſurprizing Additions made to them, not only by baſe and
unworthy Minds, Wretches devoid of Truth and common Honeſty, but alſo by
Perſons of high Rank, and ſuch as outwardly profeſs Chriſtianity; who
have fancied it an Act of Piety to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and ſpread of me the moſt
impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and notorious Falſhoods! nay, ſo far has their perſecuting
Zeal been carried, that they have rendered my honeſt Induſtry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0095100801:10"/> and by depriving me of any Means to ſupport Life,
endeavoured to make me even ſuch a one, as they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me to be: That
Clergymen, and Ladies of Honour, ſhould unite, in driving to Extremity, a
Perſon, who never yet, either in her Converſation, or Writing, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
againſt the Laws of Decency or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, is but too apt to make one think,
they had quite forgotten the Chriſtian Grace, <hi>Charity,</hi> without which
we are told, all other Virtues are of no Avail, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, fall far
ſhort of Perfection them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>I therefore hope thoſe who have taken ſuch unbounded Liberties
with my Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will alſo allow me to paint out theirs, only with this
Difference, that I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine myſelf to Truth, a Favour I never yet
received at their Hands; ſince even the prieſtly Robe, and Mitred Head,
have, with Regard to me, diſclaimed it, of which, in the Series of theſe
melancholy Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I ſhall be able to produce many ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
Inſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0095100801:11"/>I was born in the Year 1712; by my Mother's
Side deſcended of an antient and honourable Family, who were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intermarried with the Nobility. My Great Grandfather was Earl of
<hi>Killmallock,</hi> whoſe Daughter married Colonel <hi>Meade,</hi> by whom
he had twenty-one Children, twelve of whom lived to be married. This Gentleman,
to his Honour be it ſpoken, tho' he was a Man of Fortune, and in the Army,
declared on his Death-bed, 
<q rend="inline">'That he never had, either when a Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, or a
married Man, criminal Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with a Woman; never was drunk; never
broke his Word; nor ever uſed Tobacco.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>The late Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> when Lord Lieutenant of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> dining at Colonel <hi>Meade</hi>'s, offered to confer on him
the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Knighthood; but he then being in an advanced Age, declined it
for himſelf, telling his Grace, 
<q rend="inline">'As he was going out of the World, and his
eldeſt Son coming into it, he would chuſe, if he thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, his Grace
ſhould beſtow it on him:'</q> Which accordingly he did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0095100801:12"/>This Gentleman, Sir <hi>John Meade,</hi> was
bred to the Law, and deſervedly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as one of the fineſt
Orators that ever ſpoke at the Bar: He was a perfect Maſter of
claſſical Learning; and a Lover and Judge of the muſe-like Arts; his
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Eſtate was about Fifteen Hundred Pounds a Year, which was augmented
by marrying ſucceſſively two great Heireſſes; as well as by the
vaſt Buſineſs he had in his Profeſſion: So that with all thoſe
Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Nature, Education, and Fortune, it was no Wonder he ſhould
meet with univerſal Reſpect and Eſteem.</p>
            <p>He was in this Situation, when Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Seymor</hi> had an
Eſtate of five Thouſand Pounds a Year left to him in <hi>Ireland</hi>; this
was a Matter too conſiderable for Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to hope immediately to
poſſeſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law-ſuit or Difficulty; ſo that he found his
perſonal Appearance abſolutely neceſſary. It is to be obſerved, that
Sir <hi>Edward Seymor</hi> was accounted the proudeſt Man in
<hi>England</hi>; and Sir <hi>John Meade</hi> was as remarkable for the ſame
Fault; neither indeed did I ever meet with any Perſon of <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0095100801:13"/>
either of thoſe Names in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who was not
abundantly ſtocked with it, tho' without the ſame Pretenſions to
ſupport it.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Seymor</hi> landed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> filled with
that natural Contempt for the whole Country, which thoſe of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> who have not been reſident amongſt them, are but too
apt to expreſs on every Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: He there found ſome of his own
Countrymen in Places of Profit and Truſt, of whom he enquired, 
<q rend="inline">'Whether there are any ſuch Things as good
Lawyers to be met with in this damned Place?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>They anſwered, 
<q rend="inline">'Yes, very good; but if he hoped to carry his
Cauſe, he muſt ſee Sir <hi>John Meade:</hi> Well, ſaid he, let one of
my Footmen go for him.'</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'Your Footman, Sir <hi>Edward!</hi> ſaid one of
the Gentlemen, who knew Sir <hi>John:</hi> Why, 'tis odds if he will ſpeak to
You. I aſſure you, if he does, 'tis a Favour few of his Clients obtain from
him.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'What, <hi>a Duce,</hi> return'd he, do
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Lawyers take ſuch State upon them?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'You are to conſider, Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> he is
a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0095100801:14"/> of Family, has a noble Fortune, and is ſo
eminent in his Profeſſion, that ſhould he be employed againſt you, you
may bid Farewel to your Claim.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This laſt Argument had ſuch Force with Sir <hi>Edward
Seymor,</hi> that he condeſcended to wait on Sir <hi>John Meade</hi> next
Morning: Sir <hi>John</hi> had been apprized of what the other had ſaid; and
reſolving to be as ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as himſelf, ſent him down Word, 
<q rend="inline">'He was very buſy, but if he pleaſed to wait
till he was at Leiſure, he would ſee him.'</q> So Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was
ſhewn into a Parlour, where he remained above an Hour, fretting himſelf to
Death, at this diſreſpectful Uſage offered to a Perſon of his
Dignity.</p>
            <p>When Sir <hi>John</hi> thought he had pretty ſufficiently
mortified him, he ſent to let him know, he ſhould be glad to ſee him, and
received him with a Politeneſs natural to him; but when Sir <hi>Edward</hi>
went to open his Caſe to him, he told him, 
<q rend="inline">'He muſt leave him his Brief, for he could not
ſpare Time to hear him:'</q> So Sir <hi>Edward</hi> laid down his Brief, with
a large Purſe of Gold on it; and, having got his Audience <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0095100801:15"/>
of Leave, departed, full of Indignation at meeting with a Man as proud as
himſelf.</p>
            <p>When the Day appointed for the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Trial was come, there
were Numbers of Lawyers engaged on either Side of the Queſtion: Sir
<hi>John</hi> being, I ſuppoſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try his Client's Patience to
the uttermoſt, permitted every one of them to ſpeak before him, without
Interruption, and ſat drawing Birds with a Pencil, till Sir <hi>Edward</hi>
was ready to burſt with Rage at him, eſpecially as he found the Cauſe
likely to go againſt him: At length, when their Pleadings were ended, and
Judgment going to be pronounced againſt Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Meade</hi> aroſe, and deſired to be heard, which he ever was with Favour
and Attention by the Court, when making a Speech, which took an Hour and a half
in Time, he ſo fully confuted all Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Antagoniſts, and
made his Title to the Eſtate ſo evident, and with ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eloquence, that he had a Decree to be put in immediate Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was ſo charmed with Sir <hi>John</hi>'s
graceful Elocution, that he could <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0095100801:16"/> not forbear ſeveral
Times crying out in Extacy, <hi>An Angel! by Heaven, an Angel!</hi> But when he
found the happy Effects of it ſo much to his own Advantage, he could no
longer contain himſelf, but cathing Sir <hi>John</hi> in his Arms, <hi>My
dear, dear Friend!</hi> ſays he, permit me to have the Honour of calling you
ſo: I do not wonder you ſhould be proud, who have more Cauſe to be ſo,
than any Man living.</p>
            <p>The Court not breaking up, till it was late, Sir <hi>Edward</hi>
preſſed Sir <hi>John</hi> to give him his Company that Evening; Sir
<hi>John</hi> excuſed himſelf, telling him, 
<q rend="inline">'He was every Night engaged to a Club:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Well, then, ſaid Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> if you
will give me Leave, I will accompany you; (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you think it will be
agreeable to your Friends?)'</q> Sir <hi>John</hi> anſwered, 
<q rend="inline">'They would all, he was ſure, eſteem it as a
very great Honour.'</q> So according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sir <hi>Edward</hi> met them, and they
were mutually delighted with each other's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, we may preſume, by
their ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together till Four the next Morning. Some of Sir
<hi>Edward</hi>'s Friends finding him <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0095100801:17"/> in Bed at Twelve
o'Clock the enſuing Day, he told them, 
<q rend="inline">'He had ſat up all Night:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'With whom, Sir <hi>Edward?</hi>'</q> Why,
returned he, 
<q rend="inline">'With <hi>Homer, Plato, Socrates, Cicero,</hi> and
all the antient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Poets, Philoſophers and
Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>From this Time, Sir <hi>Edward</hi> and Sir <hi>John</hi>
contracted a Friendſhip, which did not terminate, but with their Lives.</p>
            <p>As this little Piece of Hiſtory redounds to the mutual Honour of
both theſe great and eminent Gentlemen; I hope it will not be accounted
Vanity in me to recite it.</p>
            <p>One of Sir <hi>John Meade</hi>'s Siſters, being ſmitten with
the good Mien of a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Officer in King <hi>James</hi>'s
Army, ſtole a Match with him, of which my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Firſt-fruits; but
her Mother dying in Childbed of her ſecond Child, and King <hi>William</hi>
entirely ſubduing <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> my Grandfather thought proper to follow
his Royal Maſter's Fortune to <hi>France,</hi> leaving my Mother, then an
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, to the wide World: However, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did not abandon the helpleſs
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan; <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0095100801:18"/> her Grandmother, the Widow of Colonel
<hi>Meade</hi> before-mentioned, took her Home to her; and while ſhe lived,
with true maternal Tenderneſs, beſtowed on her the beſt and politeſt
Education: And when the Truſtees ſat in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it being proved
ſhe was bred a Proteſtant, ſhe recovered her Mother's Fortune, which had
been ſettled on her, and which ſhe had been ſome Years kept out of, on
Account of her Father's being a forfeiting Perſon.</p>
            <p>He, in the mean time, returned privately to <hi>England,</hi> and
married a Niece of the celebrated Jeſuit Father <hi>Hugh Peters</hi>: by this
ſecond Venture, he had one Daughter, who was married to Mr. <hi>Fowler</hi>
of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> the ſole Heireſs of
whom is the preſent Lady <hi>Faulconbridge,</hi> to whom, were it of any
Uſe to me, I have the Honour of being a firſt Couſin by the
Half-Blood.</p>
            <p>My Mother being now in Poſſeſſion of a handſome Fortune,
and by the Death of her Grandmother entirely at her own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, for her
Fathern ever enquired what became of her, did not, it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0095100801:19"/> want Admirers; eſpecially as ſhe had a very graceful
Perſon, with Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Wit, which was improved by reading and keeping the
beſt Company: however, none of them made any Impreſſion on her Heart,
till ſhe ſaw my Father, who was the Son of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Phyſician,
that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally ſettled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and who had no other Fortune
to boaſt of, than a liberal Education, and a very amiable Perſon and
Underſtanding; Qualities which recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to my Mother ſo powerfully,
that ſhe had Conſtancy enough to wait for him three Years, while he went to
<hi>Leyden,</hi> where he ſtudied Phyſick under the late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dr.
<hi>Boerhaave</hi>; and having taken his Degree, he returned to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> uniting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Marriage to his faithful Miſtreſs.
Her Friends were at firſt much diſpleaſed with her; but my Father's Merit
ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled them to her Choice; and there being then but one Man-Midwife
in the Kingdom, my Father made himſelf Maſter of that uſeful Art, and
practiſed it with great Succeſs, Reputation, and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0095100801:20"/>I was their ſecond Child, and my eldeſt
Brother dying an Infant, for a long Time their only one; being of a tender
weakly Conſtitution, I was by my Father greatly indulged; indeed I cannot
ſay, but it was in ſome Meaſure neceſſary he ſhould, by his
Gentleneſs, qualify my Mother's Severity to me; otherwiſe it muſt have
broke my Heart; for ſhe ſtrictly followed <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Advice, in
never ſparing the Rod; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I have frequently been whipt for
looking blue of a froſty Morning; and, whether I deſerved it or not, I was
ſure of Correction every Day of my Life.</p>
            <p>From my earlieſt Infancy I had a ſtrong Diſpoſition to
Letters; but my Eyes being weak, after the Small-pox, I was not permitted to
look at a Book; my Mother regarding more the Beauty of my Face, than the
Improvement of my Mind; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was I allowed to learn to read: This
Reſtraint, as it generally happens, made me but more earneſt in the
Purſuit of what I imagined muſt be ſo delightful. Twenty times a Day have
I been corrected, for aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſuch and ſuch Letters ſpelt; my 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0095100801:21"/> Mother uſed to tell me the Word, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it with a
good Box on the Ear, which, I ſuppoſe, imprinted it on my Mind. Had
<hi>Gulliver</hi> ſeen her Behaviour, I ſhould have imagined, he had
borrowed a Hint from it for his floating Iſland, where, when a great Man had
promiſed any Favour, the Suppliant was obliged to give him a Tweak by the
Noſe, or a Kick on the Rump, to quicken his Memory. However, I do aſſure
you, it had this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on me, inſomuch, that I never forgot what was once
told me; and quickly arrived at my deſired Happineſs, being able to read
before ſhe thought I knew all my Letters; but this Pleaſure I was obliged
to enjoy by Stealth with Fear and Trembling.</p>
            <p>I was at this Time about five Years of Age; and my Mother being
one Day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, I had happily laid hold on <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Feaſt,</hi> and
found ſomething in it ſo charming, that I read it aloud;—but how like
a condemned Criminal did I look, when my Father, ſoftly opening his
Study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, took me in the very Fact; I dropt my Book, and burſt into Tears,
begging <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0095100801:22"/> Pardon, and promiſing never to do ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
But my Sorrow was ſoon diſpelled, when he bade me not be frightened, but
read to him, which, to his great Surprize, I did very diſtinctly, and without
hurting the Beauty of the Numbers. Inſtead of the whipping, of which I
ſtood in dread, he took me up in his Arms, and kiſſed me, giving me a
whole Shilling, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and told me, 
<q rend="inline">'He would give me another, as ſoon as I got a
Poem by Heart,'</q> which he put into my Hand, and proved to be Mr.
<hi>Pope</hi>'s ſacred Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue; which Taſk I performed before my Mother
returned Home. They were both aſtoniſhed at my Memory, and from that Day
forward, I was permitted to read as much as I pleaſed; only my Father took
care to furniſh me with the beſt, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Authors; and took Delight
in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, whatever, by Reaſon of my tender Years, was above my
Capacity of Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>But chiefly was I charmed and raviſhed with the Sweets of
Poetry; all my Hours were dedicated to the Muſes; and, from a 
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0095100801:23"/> Reader, I quickly became a Writer; I may truly ſay with
Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> 
               <q> 
                  <l>I liſp'd in Numbers, for the Numbers came.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>My Performances had the good Fortune to be looked on as
extraordinary for my Years; and the greateſt and wiſeſt Men in the
Kingdom did not diſdain to hear the Prattle of the little Muſe, as they
called me, even in my childiſh Days. But as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached towards Womanhood
there was a new Scene opened to me; and by the Time I had looked on thirteen
Years, I had almoſt as many Lovers; not that I ever was handſome, farther
than being very fair. But I was well-dreſt, ſprightly, and remarkably
well-tempered, unapt to give or take Offence; inſomuch that my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was
generally coveted; and no doubt but I ſhould have been happily diſpoſed
of in Marriage, but that my Mother's capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Temper made her reject every
advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Propoſal offered, and at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me to the Arms of one
of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt V—s, with Reverence to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0095100801:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> be it ſpoken, that ever was wrapt up in
Crape.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot forbear obſerving, how very few who wear that
S—d H—t are adorned with any real Sanctity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: What
Ambition, Avarice, Luſt, and Cruelty reigns among them; they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
the firſt Seducers of Innocence (as the Holineſs of their Office gives them
free Admittance into every Family) and as ſoon as they have made a Breach in
the tender Mind for Ruin's waſteful Entrance, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they can but ſlip
their own Necks out of the Halter and remain unexpoſed) they ſhall be the
firſt to perſecute with Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Courts, and Spiritual
Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that very Perſon, whom they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firſt taught the Way
to ſin. 
<q> 
                  <l>Let none preſume to cenſure this as Spite,</l> 
                  <l>I ſuffer for their Crimes of whom I write,</l>
               </q> And 'tis
ever allowed that the Loſers may have leave to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>I would not, by this Reflection, be thought to ſtrike at
Religion, or the valuable Part <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0095100801:25"/> of the Clergy: Thoſe who
are poſſeſſed of Chriſtian Charity, and make the Sincerity of their
Faith appear in the Righteouſneſs of their Life, are truly worthy of
Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Honour; but alas! their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is ſo few, that the Ears of
Corn are ſcarce diſcernable among the Tares, of whom no doubt Satan will
reap a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Harveſt.</p>
            <p>But to return. Amongſt all thoſe who addreſt me, my Heart
retained its Freedom; and if their Flattery pleaſed me, it was only as it fed
my Vanity; that Paſſion, which, like Pride, is ſo univerſal: I had no
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Engagement, was entirely ſubmiſſive to my Parents, punctual
to all the Duties of Religion, unaffectedly innocent, and much more pleaſed
with my Female Friends, than with the Company of Men.</p>
            <p>There were two young Ladies, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, for whom, from my
Childhood, I had a very tender Affection, and whom, as often as I could, I
viſited; as their Brother was a Clergyman, many of the Gown fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented their
Houſe, and amongſt the reſt, the Reader of our Pariſh-Church, Mr. 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0095100801:26"/> 
               <hi>P—n.</hi> He had a good Face, and many agreeable
Accompliſhments; as a tolerable Taſte in Muſic, and a poetical Turn,
which greatly entertained me; but being a Man of obſcure Birth, and low
Fortune, I had no farther Thoughts of him, than merely as an Acquaintance:
However, it was my Misfortune to be liked by him, when I leaſt imagined it;
as he played very well on the Organ, he gave us an Invitation to Church,
promiſing, after Evening-Prayer, to ſing an Anthem for us. I, who always
delighted in Church-Muſic, begged my Mother's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to go, which,
with ſome Difficulty, I obtained. After the Muſic he invited us into the
Veſtry-Room, where he had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a little Collation of Fruit, Wine,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſingling me out, he began to addreſs me in a very
paſſionate Stile, and earneſtly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Leave to viſit me: I told him, 
<q rend="inline">'I was to go into the Country next Day, to ſtay
all the Summer, and were I not, I had no Male Viſitants, but ſuch as my
Parents approved of; and conſequently it was out of my Power to grant his
Requeſt.'</q> My Mother ſending for me, prevented any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0095100801:27"/> Converſation for that Time; and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next Morning
we ſet out on our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Journey.</p>
            <p>During my Stay in the Country, he wrote me a great many poetical
Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſubſcribed himſelf <hi>Amintas:</hi> As they were
really very elegant, my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who always examined my Letters, expreſt
great Curioſity to know the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">'I ought to return a Letter of Thanks to him:'</q>
But as I took this only for a Trap, I told her, which was true, I knew not who
it was; leſt I ſhould be denied the Pleaſure of viſiting the young
Ladies, where I firſt ſaw him, if I ſhould have given her the
ſmalleſt Hint, that I gueſſed at the Perſon.</p>
            <p>I had, by this Time, a Brother of about nine Years of Age, of whom
my Father and Mother were fond even to Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; whenever I went abroad,
he uſed to cry to go with me, and was conſtantly indulged in it.</p>
            <p>A few Days after our Return to Town, I went to wait on the young
Ladies before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and took my Brother with me; <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0095100801:28"/> I
was ſcarce ſeated when Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> came in; and after ſaluting
me, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me with Cruelty, in never having favoured him with an
Anſwer to any of his Letters. I told him, 
<q rend="inline">'I was much obliged to him, for the agreeable
Entertainment they had afforded me; but that, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Father, I had never
wrote to any Man, neither was I Miſtreſs of Wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to correſpond
with him.'</q> A good many civil Things were ſaid on either Hand, during Tea
Time; after which my Brother growing urgent with me to return Home, I happened
to ſay he was ſo great a Favourite, I durſt not contradict him; upon
which, Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> made his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to him, and gave him an
Invitation to his Lodgings; where he entertained him ſo kindly, that the
Child returned in Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with him; and loaden with Toys and Sweetmeats. Upon
this Civility to my Brother, my Father ſent and invited Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> to Dinner; (and you may be ſure he did not refuſe him)
but quickly found the Art of making himſelf ſo agreeable to my Parents,
that they were even uneaſy <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0095100801:29"/> whenever he was abſent;
which ſeldom happened, except when his Duty required his Attendance. He now
began openly to court me; and, to my great Surprize, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them feemod
averſe to it; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him as much Liberty of converſing with me, as a
reaſonable Man could deſire; and for my own Part, he gained ſo large a
Share in my Eſteem, that as they ſeemed to approve of him, I was very well
ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>One Year paſt on in this Manner, during which Time, Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> never omitted any Thing to convince me of the Sincerity of
his Paſſion; and tho' he ſaw me every Day, and all the Day; yet every Day
was ſtill but as the firſt: 
<q> 
                  <l>So eager was he ſtill to ſee me more.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The enſuing Spring, my Mother took a Lodging, about a Mile from
<hi>Dublin,</hi> by the Sea-ſide, for the Benefit of bathing, where my Father
and Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> came every Afternoon together to viſit us; but my
Father's Buſineſs ſeldom permitting <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0095100801:30"/> him to ſtay
above half an Hour, he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally left Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> with us: Who, one
Night happening to ſtay later than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, left a Gold Watch, and a
handſome Diamond Ring in my Poſſeſſion; leſt, as he ſaid, he
ſhould be robbed of them going Home. My Father and he coming to us the next
Day, (according to Cuſtom) I brought to Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> his Ring and
Watch; but he would by no Means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of either, but inſiſted on my
keeping them as a Preſent; my Father and Mother were both by; and neither of
them ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Diſlike to it, I was, with great Reluctance, obliged by
him to take them.</p>
            <p>I mention theſe Particulars, trifling as they are, becauſe I
have been accuſed of Diſobedience to my Parents, in marrying without their
Conſent or Knowledge; whereas they were acquainted with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair from
Beginning to End; neither was I any more than paſſive in it; never hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allowed myſelf to have any Will but theirs.</p>
            <p>My Father was at this Time ſo eminent in his Profeſſion, and
lived after ſo elegant <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0095100801:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> a manner, that every body
concluded, he was able to give me a very good Fortune; and few People could
believe he counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s Addreſſes to me; he
neither having any Preferment in the Church, nor any other Fortune: And
what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Merit an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergyman may poſſeſs, he has little
Hope of Advancement by it, unleſs he has ſome Relation in the Houſe of
Commons, who, by betraying the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his Country, can procure for him,

And in this, the preſent State of poor <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> nearly reſembles
that of <hi>England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when, as
ſoon as a Biſhoprick became vacant, an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was immediately

            <p>I have frequently obſerved it, as a Want of Policy in the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, to permit the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> to have
an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity: Learning naturally inſpires Men with the Love of Liberty;
the Principles of which ought to be diſcouraged in the Minds of thoſe, whom
their Maſters are pleaſed to condemn to Slavery, Want and Oppreſſion;
unleſs, perhaps it may be done with a cruel Intent, of making their Yoke the

            <p>But to reſume my Thread. All my Friends and Relations attacked
my Father warmly on this Head; who ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, 
<q rend="inline">'He knew nothing of any amorous Correſpondence
between Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> and his Daughter, that the Gentleman came to

<q rend="inline">'Since ſuch a Report was ſpread, he would
civilly forbid him the Houſe;'</q> which accordingly he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my Mother to
do. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> came as uſual, and my Mother delivered her
dreadful Commiſſion to him. No ſooner was the fatal Sentence pronounced,
but my aſtoniſhed Lover fell pale and ſpeechleſs to the Floor; and to
ſay the Truth, my Caſe was little better than his: I raiſed him in my
Arms, and ſenſeleſs as he ſeemed, he graſped me cloſe, and leaned
his drooping Head upon my Boſom; whilſt my Mother applied Remedies to 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0095100801:34"/> him till he revived: When he came to himſelf, he blamed
us for our Care: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 
<q rend="inline">'Since I was loſt, he could not, would not

            </p>
            <p>As I was naturally of a ſoft compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Temper, the
Condition I ſaw him in pierced my very Soul; but I was too much in Awe of my
Mother to venture to ſay ſo at that Time. So he left me with Sorrow deeply
imprinted in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and, as I believed, in his Heart.</p>
            <p>About two Years before this, a young Woman of about eighteen Years
of Age, was brought to my Father, by a Stationer, to be by him inſtructed in
Midwifery: She was Miſtreſs of <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latin</hi> and
<hi>French,</hi> underſtood the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> as well as moſt Men:
And what made theſe extraordinary Talents yet more ſurprizing, was, that
her Parents were poor illiterate Country People; ſo that her Learning
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like the Gift poured out on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, of ſpeaking all
Languages, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Pains of Study; or, like the intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Knowledge of
Angels: Yet in as much as the Power of Miracles is ceaſed; we 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0095100801:35"/> muſt allow ſhe uſed human Means for ſuch great and
excellent Acquirements: And yet in a long Friendſhip and Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with
her, I could never obtain a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Account from her on this Head; only
ſhe ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'ſhe had received ſome little Inſtruction
from the Miniſter of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, when ſhe could ſpare Time from her
Needlework, to which ſhe was cloſely kept by her Mother.'</q> She wrote
elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both in Verſe and Proſe; and ſome of the moſt delightful
Hours I ever paſt, were in the Converſation of this female
Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>My Father readily conſented to accept of her as a Pupil; and
gave her a general Invitation to his Table, ſo that ſhe and I were ſeldom
aſunder. My Parents were well pleaſed with our Intimacy, as her Piety was
not inferior to her Learning. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was owing to her own Deſire, or the
Envy of thoſe who ſurvived her, I know not; but of her various and
beautiful Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, except one Poem of her's in Mrs. <hi>Barber</hi>'s Works,
I have never ſeen any publiſhed; 'tis true, as her Turn was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0095100801:36"/> to philoſophical or divine Subjects, they might not be
agreeable to the preſent Taſte; yet could her heavenly Muſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
from its ſublime Height to the eaſy epiſtolary Stile, and ſuit itſelf
to my then gay Diſpoſition; as may appear by the two following Poems: To
make them intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, my Reader muſt obſerve, that I being in a Country
Town at the Aſſizes Time, had writ her an Account to <hi>Dublin</hi> of the
principal Entertainments I met with there and in the reſt of the Country. I
muſt alſo beg Pardon for publiſhing the Compliments paid to me in them,
which I really would omit were it poſſible. Her Anſwer to my firſt
Letter was this.

with Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s Regard for me, he applied to her to intreat a
Meeting at her Lodgings, where I frequently went.</p>
            <p>She had too much Compaſſion for a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing honourable
Lover to refuſe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and accordingly ſhe gave him No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the
next Viſit that I made to her, after having aſked my Conſent to it. Our
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview was very melancholy, and his Sighs and Tears prevailed ſo much on
my young ſoft Heart, that, at laſt, I faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be his; but
added, 
<q rend="inline">'We were both ſo young, that it would be prudent
to wait till he had ſome Preferment, or till my Parents came into better
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and that, in the mean time, I would ſee him, or write to him, as
often as I conveniently could.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I forgot to mention, that I had ſent him his Watch and Ring
ſome Days before; he would fain have prevailed on me to take them again, but
I abſolutely refuſed them.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, my Father told me, I muſt prepare to go and
ſtay a Year with my Grandfather, who lived a hundred Miles 
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0095100801:42"/> diſtant from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and that I muſt ſet
out in two Days. I made no Anſwer, but thought proper to give Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my Departure, and eaſily prevailed on my
Brother to give him a Letter; but Heav'ns! how was I frighted when he,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in a few Moments, told me, Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> had ſtabbed
himſelf with his Penknife: I ran all in Tears to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, entreating her
Permiſſion to go and ſee him. She appeared much concerned, and ſent for
him to come to us, which pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Summons he readily obeyed. But I could
ſcarce forbear laughing at my own Credulity, when my wounded Swain came to us
in perfect Health. He had indeed given himſelf a Scratch, on Purpoſe to
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify us, and had juſt ſuch a deſperate Wound as I have frequently
received from the Point of a Pin, without complaining.</p>
            <p>However, by this Artifice he once more gained Admiſſion to us,
and had an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of aſſuring my Mother, 
<q rend="inline">'That if ſhe ſent me to the
<hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> he would follow me;'</q> and added alſo, 
<q rend="inline">'That he was next Heir to a good Eſtate;'</q> 
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0095100801:43"/> which was the moſt prevailing Argument he could make
uſe of to her; and took ſuch an Effect, that ſhe not only kept him to
Supper, but ſo far indulged him, as to give him a Key to the Garden which
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened into a little Stable Lane, by which means he could come in and go out
as often as he pleaſed unnoticed. As ſoon as he left us, my Mother ſpoke
to me in this Manner: 
<q rend="inline">'Child, ſaid ſhe, I believe that young Man
loves you ſincerely, neither have your Father or I any Objection to him; but
in the Light we appear in to the World, it would ſeem ſtrange to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of
him as a Son-in law. Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not, at preſent, able to give you a
Fortune; and I know moſt of thoſe who addreſs you, hope for one with you;
and he chuſes rather to reject them, than let them into his real
Circumſtances: What I would therefore adviſe you to is this: If you love
this Man, marry him; we ſhall at firſt ſeem diſpleaſed, and then
forgive it, and do for you every thing within our Power; as he is an ingenious,
ſober Man, your Father's Intereſt may <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0095100801:44"/> ſoon get him a
Living, and till then ye ſhall both live with us.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe ſtrangely ſurprized me, and left me
doubtful how to act; to take to myſelf the Reproach of Diſobedience, in the
Eyes of the World, appeared very ſhocking to me; and tho' I was reſolved to
marry Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> ſome Time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet I was ſtartled at the
Thought of doing it immediately, and told my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Objections: However
they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared but trifling to her. The next Morning ſhe called me pretty
early to Breakfaſt, and, to my great Surprize, I found Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>
with my Father, his Harpſichord placed in the Parlour, which, with a Cat and
an Owl, were all his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goods.</p>
            <p>He told me with great Rapture, that he was going for a Ring and a
Licence to be married in the Evening. As for my Part, I thought he only
jeſted, till my Father confirmed it, by telling me I muſt either reſolve
to marry immediately, or break off with Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> entirely,
leaving it to my Choice which to do. I was too <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0095100801:45"/> much
confounded to make any other Return than to give my Hand to Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> who kiſſed it with great Extacy; and my unfortunate
Nuptials being thus concluded, we were married privately in the Evening by the
Vicar-General, having no other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes but my Father and Mother, and his
Father, and we reſolved to keep it ſecret for a few Days to avoid the Hurry
and Expence of Matrimony. We went into the Country to my Uncle Brigadier
<hi>Meade</hi>'s Seat for a Fortnight; where my new eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed Huſband

having no Remedy, I was obliged to bear as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently as I could; for if I
quitted her Houſe, I had no Place to go to, as Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s whole
Income would ſcarce have paid the Rent of a tolerable ready furniſhed
Lodging. However I had ſome Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s
Tenderneſs, which <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0095100801:48"/> ſeemed daily to increaſe for me,
and in the Converſation of a very agreeable Set of Friends, ſome of whom it
may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to give a particular Deſcription of.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, I had the Honour of being well received by
Mrs. <hi>Percival,</hi> who is married to the Brother of the Earl of
<hi>Egmont,</hi> to whoſe Virtues I cannot refuſe doing Juſtice, (altho'
her Cenſures of me have not been over-charitable) a Lady of moſt
univerſal Genius, there being no one Accompliſhment, that adorns the Woman
of Quality but what ſhe poſſeſſed; and her Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave her an
Opportunity of ſhewing them to Advantage; ſhe was alſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy
in her Family; her Huſband was a moſt worthy Gentleman; both her Sons Men
of Senſe and Honour, and one of her Daughters very agreeable. It may eaſily
be ſuppoſed this Belle Aſſembly engaged the Company of all the learned
and polite World; every Night was a Drawing-Room, and the ingenious and curious
of both Sexes went Home delighted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. As my Father was Phyſician
to Mrs. <hi>Percival,</hi> and her eldeſt Son married <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0095100801:49"/> to
a near Relation of mine, I had at all Times free Acceſs, and ſo found a
frequent pleaſing Relief from my Vexations.</p>
            <p>I had alſo the much envied Honour of being known to Dr.
<hi>Swift,</hi> whoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, excellent as it was, ſurpaſſed not his
Humanity in the moſt judicious and uſeful Charities; altho' often hid under
a rough Appearance, till he was perfectly convinced both of the Honeſty and
Diſtreſs of thoſe he beſtowed it on: He was a perpetual Friend to Merit
and Learning; and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapable of Envy. Indeed why ſhould he not? who,
in true genuine Wit, could fear no Rival.</p>
            <p>Yet as I have frequently obſerved in Life, that where great
Talents are beſtowed, there the ſtrongeſt Paſſions are likewiſe
given: This truly great Man did but too often let them have Dominion over him,
and that on the moſt trifling Occaſions. During Meal-times he was evermore
in a Storm; the Meat was always too much or too little done, or the Servants
had offended in ſome Point, imperceptible to the reſt of the Company;
however, when the Cloth <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0095100801:50"/> was taken away, he made his
Gueſts rich Amends for the Pain he had given them by the former Part of his
Behaviour. For 
<q> 
                  <l>Then was truly mingled in the friendly Bowl</l> 
                  <l>The Feaſt of Reaſon and the Flow of Soul.</l> 
                  <bibl>Pope.</bibl>
               </q> Yet ſtrict Temperance preſerved; for
the Doctor never drank above half a Pint of Wine, in every Glaſs of which he
mixed Water and Sugar; yet, if he liked his Company, would ſit many Hours
over it, unlocking all the Springs of Policy, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, true Humour and
inimitable Wit.</p>
            <p>It is a very great Loſs to the World, that this admirable
Gentleman never could be prevailed on to give us the Particulars of his own
Life; becauſe, as it is the Fate of all eminent Perſons to have various
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters given of them, ſo it was more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably his: One Reaſon for
this may juſtly be aſſigned; that as at his firſt ſetting out Party
ran high, thoſe who on either Side had any Talents for Writing, ſpared not
to throw the blackeſt Aſperſions on the <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0095100801:51"/> other; ſo
that, if we give them both Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, we muſt conclude, there was neither
Honour nor Virtue among them; but that all who were out, <hi>Tories</hi> and
<hi>Whigs, Whigs</hi> and <hi>Tories,</hi> were equally corrupt: Indeed
Ambition is a grand Deceiver, and apt to undermine Integrity itſelf; and this
the Doctor himſelf was ſo ſenſible of, that I have frequently heard him
declare, 
<q rend="inline">'He thought it a great Bleſſing that all his
Hopes of Preferment were at once cut off; inſomuch that he had nothing to
tempt or miſlead him from a Patriotiſm, in which his grateful Country found
their Happineſs and Security.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This leads me to a Story, I remember to have heard him tell, and
therefore, I hope, cannot be impertinent:</p>
            <p>A Clergyman, whoſe Character greatly reſembled that I have
heard Biſhop <hi>Berkley</hi> give to Biſhop <hi>Atterbury</hi>; namely, a
moſt learned fine Gentleman, who under the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and politeſt
Appearance concealed the moſt turbulent Ambition: This Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having made
his Merit, as a Preacher, too eminent to be overlooked, had it early 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0095100801:52"/> rewarded with a Mitre; his Friend Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> went
to congratulate him on it; but at the ſame Time told him, 
<q rend="inline">'He hoped, as his Lordſhip was a Native of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and had now a Seat in the Houſe of Peers, he would employ
his powerful Elocution in the Service of his diſtreſſed Country.'</q> The
Prelate told him, 
<q rend="inline">'The Biſhoprick was but a very ſmall one, and
he could not hope for a better, if he did not oblige the Court.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Very well, ſays <hi>Swift,</hi> then it is to
be hoped, when you have a better, you will become an honeſt Man.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Ay, that I will, Mr. Dean, ſays he, till then,
my Lord, farewel.'</q> This pious Prelate was twice tranſlated to richer
Sees; and, on every Tranſlation, Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> waited on him to remind
him of his Promiſe, but to no Purpoſe; there was now an Archbiſhoprick in
View, and till that was obtained, nothing could be done: This in a ſhort Time
he likewiſe poſſeſſed; he then ſent for the Dean, and told him, 
<q rend="inline">'I am now at the Top of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, for I well
know no <hi>Iriſhman</hi> will ever be made Primate, therefore as 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0095100801:53"/> I can riſe no higher in Fortune or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will
zealouſly promote the good of my Country.'</q> (A fine Reaſon truly!) And
ſo he commenced a moſt outrageous Patriot, from thoſe very laudable
Motives, and continued ſo till his Death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened within theſe few
Years.</p>
            <p>I hope my Readers will indulge me in the frequent Mention I
ſhall make of Dr. <hi>Swift</hi>; for tho' his Works are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
eſteemed; yet few Perſons now living, have had ſo many Opportunities of
ſeeing him in private Life; as my being a Perſon <hi>ſans</hi>
Conſequence afforded me, which Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs I obtained by the following
Means:</p>
            <p>The learned Nymph before-mentioned, whom Curioſity engaged every
Perſon to ſee, had ſhewn many of my Scribbles to Dr. <hi>Delany,</hi>
known ſufficiently by his own incomparable Life and Writings: As ſhe was
one of the firſt to congratulate me on my Marriage; ſhe was a Witneſs how
ſeverely both Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> and I were uſed, or rather abuſed by
my Mother; ſhe told Dr. <hi>Delany</hi> of it, and made ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
mention of the poor young Couple, <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0095100801:54"/> that he generouſly
imagined his countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> might be a Means of
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing us better Treatment. He had been Claſs-fellow with my Father in
the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and tho' they did not viſit, yet they had that mutual Eſteem
for each other, which good Men feel for good Men; and were pleaſed whenever
Accident threw them into each other's Company. The Doctor, preaching at our
Pariſh Church immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after our Marriage, was ſo kind as to join us
coming out, and accompany us Home, to wiſh the young Couple Joy, a Favour we
were all extremely proud of; at parting he gave us all an Invitation to to dine
at his beautiful Villa, about a ſmall Mile diſtant from <hi>Dublin</hi>;
what Opinion I conceived of him and his Improvements, may be ſeen in the
following Lines, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in one of his lovely Arbours:—

            </p>
            <p>Whether it was owing to my Youth, or any real Merit in the
Verſes, I know not, but, weak as they were, from the Candour of the Company
they met with great Applauſe, and the worthy Gentleman to whom they were
directed, praiſed the Poetry extremely, only modeſtly wiſhed I had a
better Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to employ my fine Genius, as he was pleaſed to call it.</p>
            <p>I hope, if I ſhould live to publiſh theſe Writings, none of
the honourable Perſons mentioned in them, as having been once my Friends,
will be offended at it; ſince whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Misfortunes have ſince befallen me,
I was not then quite unworthy of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they ſhewed me, and ſtill
retain a grateful Senſe of their Favour; only la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting that by one fatal
Folly it is irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably loſt.</p>
            <p>And now I muſt confeſs, as I have talked of Ambition, I had a
ſtrong one to be known to Dr. <hi>Swift:</hi> As Dr. <hi>Delany</hi> had
recommended and introduced Mr. <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0095100801:57"/> 
               <hi>P—n</hi> to him,
and the learned Lady before-mentioned, I thought it a little hard to be
excluded from the Delight and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction I might poſſibly receive from
ſuch Converſation; and having often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated on this Head, to no
Purpoſe, I at laſt told them, (for to give me my due I was pretty pert) 
<q rend="inline">'that truly they were envious, and would not let
me ſee the Dean, knowing how much I ſurpaſſed them all.'</q> As I
ſpoke this but half ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, I ſet them all a laughing, and as they were
to meet the next Day at the Deanery-Houſe to keep the Anniverſary of his
Birth-day, I incloſed to Dr. <hi>Delany</hi> the following Lines: 
<q> 
                  <lg>
                     <head>To the Rev. Dr. <hi>SWIFT,</hi> on his

                     <l>Patriot, Philoſopher and Bard,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Delany</hi> preſented theſe Lines to the Dean, and at
the ſame time told him my ſaucy Speech above-mentioned. The Dean kindly
accepted of my Compliment, and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'He would ſee me whenever I pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.'</q> A
moſt welcome Meſſage to me!</p>
            <p>A few Days after, the Dean ſent the Doctor Word, he would dine
with him at <hi>Delville,</hi> and deſired to meet Mr. and Mrs.
<hi>P—n</hi> there: You may be aſſured I obeyed this welcome Summons,
and a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0095100801:59"/> was ſo kind as to call on me to go
with her; when we arrived, Dr. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany</hi>'s Servant told us, his
Maſter, the Dean, and Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> were walking in the Garden; we
met them on a noble Terraſs, whoſe Summit was crowned with a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Portico, where Painting and Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſplayed their utmoſt Charms: The
Lady preſented me to the Dean, who ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted me, and ſurprized me, by
aſking her, 
<q rend="inline">'If I was her Daughter?'</q> She ſmiled and
ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'I was Mrs. <hi>P—n.</hi>'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'What, ſays he, this poor little Child married!
God help her, ſhe is early engaged in Trouble.'</q> We paſſed the Day in
a moſt elegant and delightful Manner; and the Dean, engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> to preach for him at the Cathedral the <hi>Sunday</hi>
following, gave me alſo with the reſt of the Company an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to
Dinner. As the Communion is adminiſtered every <hi>Sunday</hi> in this
antique Church, dedicated to St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> the firſt Prelate who
taught the Goſpel in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I was charmed to ſee with what a
becoming Piety the Dean performed that ſolemn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; which he had ſo
much at Heart, that <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0095100801:60"/> he wanted not the Aſſiſtance of
the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but went quite thro' it without ever looking in the Prayer-Book.
Indeed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Part of his Behaviour on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was cenſured by
ſome as ſavouring of <hi>Popery,</hi> which was, that he bowed to the
Holy-Table; however this Circumſtance may vindicate him from the wicked
Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of being deemed an Unbeliever, ſince 'tis plain he had the
utmoſt Reverence for the Euchariſt. Service being over, we met the Dean at
the Church-Door, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a Crowd of Poor, to all of whom he gave
Charity, excepting one old Woman, who held out a very dirty Hand to him; he
told her very gravely, 
<q rend="inline">'That though ſhe was a Beggar, Water was not
ſo ſcarce but ſhe might have waſhed her Hands:'</q> And ſo we marched
with the Silver Verge before us to the Deanery-Houſe. When we came into the
Parlour, the Dean kindly ſaluted me, and without allowing me Time to ſit
down, bade me come and ſee his Study; Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> was for
following us, but the Dean told him merrily, He did not deſire his Company; 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0095100801:61"/> and ſo he ventured to truſt me with him into the
Library: 
<q rend="inline">'Well, ſays he, I have brought you here to
ſhew you all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I got when I was in the Miniſtry, but do not
ſteal any of it.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'I will not indeed, Sir, ſays I;'</q> ſo he
opened a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, and ſhewed me a whole Parcel of empty Drawers; 
<q rend="inline">'Bleſs me, ſay he, the Money is flown;'</q> he
then opened his Bureau, wherein he had a great Number of curious Trinkets of
various Kinds, ſome of which he told me, 
<q rend="inline">'Were preſented to him by the Earl and
Counteſs of <hi>Oxford</hi>; ſome by Lady <hi>Maſham,</hi> and ſome by
La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Betty Germain</hi>;'</q> at laſt, coming to a Drawer filled with
Medals, he bade me chuſe two for myſelf; but he could not help ſmiling,
when I began to poize them in my Hands, chuſing them by Weight rather than
Antiquity, of which indeed I was not then a Judge.</p>
            <p>The Dean amuſed me in this Manner till we were ſummoned to
Dinner, where his Behaviour was ſo humorous, that I cannot avoid relating
ſome Part of it: He placed himſelf at the Head of his Table oppoſite 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0095100801:62"/> to a great Pier-Glaſs, under which was a Marble
Side-board, ſo that he could ſee in the Glaſs whatever the Servants did
at it: He was ſerved entirely in Plate, and with great Elegance; but the Beef
being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaſted put us all in Confuſion, the Dean called for the
Cook-maid, and ordered her to take it down Stairs, and do it leſs; the Maid
anſwered, very innocently, 
<q rend="inline">'That ſhe could not:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why, what Sort of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are you, ſays he,
to commit a Fault which cannot be amended?'</q> And turning to me he ſaid
very gravely, 
<q rend="inline">'That he hoped, as the Cook was a Woman of Genius,
he ſhould, by this Manner of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, be able in about a Year's Time to
convince her ſhe had better ſend up the Meat too little than too much
done;'</q> charging the Men Servants, 
<q rend="inline">'Whenever they imagined the Meat was ready, they
ſhould take it Spit and all, and bring it up by Force, promiſing to aid
them, in caſe the Cook reſiſted.'</q> The Dean then turning his Eye on
the Looking-glaſs eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the Butler opening a Bottle of Ale, and helping
himſelf to the firſt Glaſs; he <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0095100801:63"/> very kindly jumbled
the reſt together, that his Maſter and Gueſts might all fare alike. 
<q rend="inline">'Ha! Friend, ſays the Dean, Sharp's the Word, I
find you drank my Ale, for which I ſtop two Shillings of your Board-Wages
this Week, for I ſcorn to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in any thing, even in cheating.'</q>
Dinner at laſt was over to my great Joy; for now I had Hope of a more
agreeable Entertainment than what the ſquabbling with the Servants had
afforded us.</p>
            <p>The Dean thanked Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> for his Sermon: 
<q rend="inline">'I never, ſays he, preached but twice in my
Life, and then they were not Sermons, but Pamphlets.'</q> I aſked him, 
<q rend="inline">'What might be the Subject of them;'</q> he told
me, 
<q rend="inline">'They were againſt <hi>Wood</hi>'s
Half-pence.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Pray, Madam, ſays he, do you ſmoke;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'No indeed, Sir, ſays I;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Nor your Huſband;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Neither, Sir:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'It is a Sign, ſaid he, you were neither of you
bred in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Oxford</hi>; for drinking and ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are
the firſt Rudiments of Learning taught there; and in thoſe two Arts no
Univerſity in <hi>Europe</hi> can out-do them.'</q> 
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0095100801:64"/> 
               <q rend="inline">'Pray Mrs. <hi>P—n</hi> tell me your
Faults;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Sir, I muſt beg to be excuſed, for if
I can help it, you ſhall never find them out;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'No, ſays he, then Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>
ſhall tell me;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'I will, Sir, ſays he, when I have diſcovered
them.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Pray Mr. Dean, ſays Dr. <hi>Delany,</hi> why
will you be ſo unpolite, as to ſuppoſe Mrs. <hi>P—n</hi> has any
Faults?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why, I will tell you, replied the Dean; whenever
I ſee a Number of agreeable Qualities in any Perſon, I am always ſure,
they have bad ones ſufficient to poize the Scale.'</q> I bowed, and told the
Dean, 
<q rend="inline">'He did me great Honour:'</q> And in this I copied
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Berkley,</hi> whom I have frequently heard declare, 
<q rend="inline">'That when any Speech was made to him, which might
be conſtrued either into a Compliment, or an Affront, or (that to make uſe
of his own Word) had two Handles; he was ſo meek and ſo mild, that he
always took hold of the beſt.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean then aſked me, 
<q rend="inline">'If I was a Queen, what I ſhould chuſe to have
after Dinner?'</q> I anſwered, 
<q rend="inline">'His Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;'</q> 
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0095100801:65"/> 
               <q rend="inline">'Phooh! ſays he, I mean what Regale?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'A Diſh of Coffee, Sir;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why then I will ſo far make you as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as a
Queen, you ſhall have ſome in Perfection; for when I was Chaplain to the
Earl of <hi>Berkley,</hi> who was in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment here, I was ſo poor, I
was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to keep a Coffee-houſe, and all the Nobility reſorted to it to
talk Treaſon:'</q> I could not help ſmiling at this Oddity, but I really
had ſuch an Awe on me, that I could not venture to aſk him, as I longed to
do, what it meant? The Bottle and Glaſſes being taken away, the Dean ſet
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout making the Coffee; but the Fire ſcorching his Hand, he called to me to
reach him his Glove, and changing the Coffee-pot to his Left-hand, held out his
Right one, ordered me to put the Glove on it, which accordingly I did; when
taking up Part of his Gown to fan himſelf with, and acting in Character of a
prudiſh Lady, he ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'Well, I do not know what to think; Women may be
honeſt that do ſuch Things, but, for my Part, I never could bear to touch
any Man's Fleſh—<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0095100801:66"/> except my Huſband's, whom
perhaps, ſays he, ſhe wiſhed at the Devil.</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> ſays he, you would not
tell me your Wife's Faults; but I have found her out to be a d—ned,
inſolent, proud, unmannerly Slut:'</q> I looked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, not knowing what
Offence I had committed.—Says Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">'Ay, Sir, I muſt confeſs ſhe is a little
ſaucy to me ſometimes, but—what has ſhe done now?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Done! why nothing, but ſat there quietly, and
never once offered to interrupt me in making the Coffee, whereas had I had a
Lady of modern good Breeding here, ſhe would have ſtruggled with me for the
Coffee-pot till ſhe had made me ſcald myſelf and her, and made me throw
the Coffee in the Fire; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at her Head, rather than permit me to take
ſo much trouble for her.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This raiſed my Spirits and as I found the Dean always prefaced a
Compliment with an Affront, I never afterwards was ſtartled at the latter,
(as too many have been, not entering into his peculiarly ironical Strain) but
was modeſtly contented with <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0095100801:67"/> the former, which was more
than I deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which the Surprize rendered doubly pleaſing.</p>
            <p>By this Time, the Bell rang for Church; and Dr. <hi>Delany</hi>
and Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> who with myſelf were now all the Company, (for
the reſt departed before the Coffee was out) were obliged to attend the
Summons: But as there is no Service in the Cathedral, but Evening-Prayer at Six
o'Clock, I choſe rather to attend the Dean there, than go to hear another
Sermon; by this means I had him all to myſelf for near three Hours, during
which Time he made me read to him the Annals of the four laſt Years of the
Reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the Intentions of which
ſeemed to be a Vindication of the then Miniſtry and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from having
any Deſign of placing the Pretender on the Throne of <hi>Great-Britain:</hi>
It began with a ſolemn Adjuration, that all the Facts therein contained were
Truth, and then proceeded in the Manner of Lord <hi>Clarendon,</hi> with giving
the particular Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of every Perſon whom he ſhould have occaſion
to mention; amongſt whom, <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0095100801:68"/> I remember, he compared Lord
<hi>Bolling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi> to <hi>Petronius,</hi> one who agreeably mingled
Buſineſs with Pleaſure. At the Concluſion of every Period, he demanded
of me, 
<q rend="inline">'Whether I underſtood it? For I would, ſays
he, have it intelligent to the meaneſt Capacity, and if you compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it, 'tis poſſible every Body may.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'I bowed, and aſſured him I did.'</q> And
indeed it was written with ſuch Perſpecuity and Elegance of Stile, that I
muſt have had no Capacity at all, if I did not taſte what was ſo
exquiſitely beautiful.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> when he was Chaplain to Alderman
<hi>Barber,</hi> in the Year of his Mayoralty, mentioned thoſe Annals to Mr.
<hi>Pope,</hi> who ſaid he had diſſuaded the Dean from publiſhing them;
as the Facts contained in them were notoriouſly falſe. I was greatly
aſtoniſhed when Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> told me this, nor could I tell what
to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: It ſeemed ſtrange to me, that a Perſon of the Dean's good
Senſe and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, ſhould in the moſt ſolemn manner invocate the
Almighty to bear Teſtimony to Falſhoods, publicly known to be ſuch. 
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0095100801:69"/> And yet as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> was in Proſe a Man of
unqueſtioned Probity, and united to the Dean in the ſtricteſt Bonds of
Friendſhip, and conſequently, without doubt, well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the
Tranſactions of thoſe Times, we can hardly ſuppoſe he would ſpeak in
the manner he did, without juſt Grounds for ſo doing; and his Evidence
ſeems ſtrengthened by his being of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion, which
muſt certainly incline him to wiſh well to a Prince of the ſame Faith.
However, upon the whole, I am inclined to judge charitably of the Dean; and to
believe, that tho' the Miniſters fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently employed him as a Writer, and
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him as a Companion; yet they had not let him into the Depth of
their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, <hi>the Myſtery of Iniquity!</hi> So that what he relates
in his Annals of the invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Attachment of thoſe in Power to the
<hi>Hanover</hi> Succeſſion and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Faith, might be
by him believed to be Truth: For who ſo wiſe but may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? And
perhaps Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s long and intimate Correſpondence with Lord
<hi>Bolling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi> gave him a better Knowledge of <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0095100801:70"/> what
was really intended at that critical Juncture. Pardon this Digreſſion.</p>
            <p>The Bell rang for Evening-Prayer, to which I accompanied the Dean.
There is a fine Organ in this Church, which, with its antique Magnificence and
ſo harmonious a Choir, brought <hi>Milton</hi>'s Lines into my Mind: 
<q> 
                  <l>And let my due Feet never fail</l> 
                  <l>To walk the ſtudious Cloyſters pale,</l> 
                  <l>And love the high embowed Roof,</l> 
                  <l>With antique Pillars, maſſy Proof,</l> 
                  <l>And ſtory'd Windows richly dight,</l> 
                  <l>Shedding a dim religious Light;</l> 
                  <l>There let the pealing Organ blow</l> 
                  <l>To the full-voic'd Choir below;</l> 
                  <l>In Service high! and Anthem clear,</l> 
                  <l>Which may with Pleaſure thro' mine Ear,</l> 
                  <l>Diſſolve me into Extaſies,</l> 
                  <l>And bring all Heaven before my Eyes.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>On our Return to the Deanery-houſe, we found there waiting our
coming Dr. <hi>Delany</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rochford,</hi> to whoſe Wife, <hi>A
Letter of Advice to a new-married Lady,</hi> 
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0095100801:71"/> (publiſhed
ſince in the Dean's Works) was written, and which by the bye, the Lady did
not take as a Compliment, either to her or the Sex, Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Sheridan,</hi> Author of the Art of Punning, with two or three other
Clergymen, (who uſually paſſed <hi>Sunday</hi> Evening with the Dean) Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> and I were for going Home, but the Dean told us, 
<q rend="inline">'He gave us leave to ſtay to Supper;'</q> which
from him was a ſufficient Invitation. The Dean then pulled out of his Pocket,
a little Gold Runlet, in which was a Bottle-Screw, and opening a Bottle of
Wine, he decanted it off; the laſt Glaſs being muddy, he called to Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> to drink it: 
<q rend="inline">'For, ſays he, I always keep ſome poor
Parſon to drink the foul Wine for me:'</q> Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> entering
into his Humour, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and told him, 
<q rend="inline">'He did not know the Difference, but was glad to
get a Glaſs at any rate:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why then, ſays the Dean, you ſhan't, for I'll
drink it my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Why, P—x take you, you are wiſer than a paultry
Curate, whom I aſked to dine with me a few Days ago; <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0095100801:72"/> for
upon my making the ſame Speech to him, he told me he did not underſtand
ſuch Uſage, and ſo walked off without his Dinner. By the ſame Token, I
told the Gentleman who recommended him to me, That the Fellow was a Blockhead,
and I had done with him.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean then miſſing his Golden Bottle-Screw, told me, very
ſternly, 
<q rend="inline">'He was ſure I had ſtolen it:'</q> I affirmed,
very ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 
<q rend="inline">'I had not:'</q> Upon which he looked for it, and
found it where he himſelf had laid it; 
<q rend="inline">''Tis well for you, ſays he, that I have got it,
or I would have charged you with Theft:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why, pray, Sir, ſhould I be ſuſpected more
than any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Company?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'For a very good Reaſon, ſays he, becauſe
you are the pooreſt.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>There now came in, to ſup with the Dean, one of the oddeſt
little Mortals I ever met with: He formerly wrote the <hi>Gazetteer</hi>; and
upon the Strength of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Author, and of having travelled, took upon him
not only to dictate to the Company, but to contradict whatever any 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0095100801:73"/> other Perſon advanced Right or Wrong, till he had
entirely ſilenced them all: And then having the whole Talk to himſelf,
(for, to my great Surprize, the Dean neither interrupted nor ſhewed any
Diſlike of him) he told us a whole String of Improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, ſuch as, 
<q rend="inline">'That each Pillar of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at
<hi>Rome</hi> took up more Ground than a Convent which was near it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were twelve Monks, with their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Garden, and Infirmary.'</q> By this
Account, every Pillar muſt take up, at leaſt, half an Acre, and,
conſidering the Number of them, we muſt conclude the Edifice to be ſome
Miles in Circumference. No one preſent had ever been at <hi>Rome,</hi> except
himſelf, ſo that he might tell us juſt what he thought proper.</p>
            <p>I took notice, that before this dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Gentleman the Dean was
moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably complaiſant to Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> and me, and at our
going away, the Dean would hand me down all the Steps to the Coach, thanking us
for the Honour of our Company, at the ſame time ſliding into my Hand as
much Money as Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> 
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0095100801:74"/> and I had given at
the Offering in the Morning, and Coach-hire alſo, which I durſt not
refuſe, leſt I ſhould have been deemed as great a Blockhead as the
Parſon, who refuſed the thick Wine.</p>
            <p>It has been a Matter of Diſpute amongſt the Learned, whether
<hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> had the Honour of giving to the World this
admirable Perſon; 'tis probable Poſterity may contend this Point, as warmly
as the ſeven Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> did the Birth-place of <hi>Homer:</hi>
And tho' in reality, 'tis of no great Importance where a Man is born; yet as
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are the eternal Ridicule of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for
their Ignorance, I am proud <hi>Hibernia</hi> had the Happineſs of producing
this brilliant Wit, to redeem the Credit of the Country; and to convince the
World, a Man may draw his firſt Breath there, and yet be learned, wiſe,
generous, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, witty, ſocial and polite.</p>
            <p>The Account I have frequently heard the Dean give of himſelf,
was, that he was born in <hi>Hoey's-Alley,</hi> in <hi>Warburgh</hi>'s
Pariſh, <hi>Dublin</hi>; his Father was a Lawyer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the
Circuit, he unfortunately <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0095100801:75"/> brought home the Itch with him,
which he had got by lying in ſome foul Bed on the Road. Somebody adviſed
him to uſe Mercury to cure it, which Preſcription coſt him his Life in a
very few Days after his Return. The Dean was a poſthumous Son to this
Gentleman, but, as he ſaid, came Time enough to ſave his Mother's Credit.
He was given to an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Woman to nurſe, whoſe Huſband being
in <hi>England,</hi> and writing to her to come to him; as ſhe could not bear
the Thoughts of parting with the Child, ſhe very fairly took him with her,
unknown to his Mother, or any of his Relations, who could learn no Tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
either of him or her for three Years; at the End of which Time, ſhe returned
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and reſtored the Child to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from whom ſhe
eaſily obtained a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, both on account of the Joy ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at
ſeeing her only Son again, when ſhe had in a manner loſt all Hope of it;
as alſo, that it was plain, the Nurſe had no other Motive for ſtealing
him, but pure Affection, which the Women of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>land</hi> generally have in as eminent Degree, for 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0095100801:76"/> the Children they nurſe, as for their own Offspring.</p>
            <p>I believe the Dean's early Youth did not promiſe that bright Day
of Wit which has ſince enlightened the learned World. Whilſt he was at the
Univerſity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> he was ſo far from being diſtinguiſhed
for any Superiority of Parts or Learning, that he was ſtopped of his Degree
as a Dunce. When I heard the Dean relate this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for I ſet down
nothing but what I had from his own Mouth, I told him, I ſuppoſed he had
been idle; but he affirmed to the contrary; aſſuring me, he was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dull, which, if true, is very ſurpriſing.</p>
            <p>I have often been led to look on the World as a Garden, and the
human Minds as ſo many Plants, ſet by the Hand of the great Creator for
Utility and Ornament. Thus, ſome we ſee, early produce beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Bloſſoms, and as ſoon fade away; others, whoſe Gems are more ſlow in
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, but more permanent, when blown; and others again, who tho' longer
in arriving at Perfection, not only bleſs us then with Shade and Odour, but
alſo with <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0095100801:77"/> delicious wholeſome Fruit. To go on with the
Allegory, we often hear from Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren very bright Sallies of Wit, and
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections above their Years: From theſe hopeful Beginnings we are apt to
expect ſomething very extraordinary in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, but how often are we
diſappointed? How often do we ſee theſe ſparkling Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren dwindle
gradually into the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum Men and Women, as if, to make uſe of the
Floriſts Phraſe, the <hi>Blow</hi> was quite over; and ſome, whoſe
Childhood has given no Preſages of great Talents, have improved every Year,
till they have brought forth the beautiful Flowers of Poetry and Rhetorick, and
the rich Fruits of Wiſdom and Virtue.</p>
            <p>Whether this Compariſon will hold, I ſubmit to the Judgment of
thoſe who are better acquainted with the ſecret Workings of Nature, than I
can preſume to be. I am afraid of going out of my Depth, and yet I have a
great Inclination to ſay a little more on this Subject.</p>
            <p>I have known a Perſon, who in his Youth was an extraordinary
Adept in Muſic, and <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0095100801:78"/> performed on ſeveral Inſtruments
extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well. I ſaw the ſame Perſon ſome Years after; and lo! his
muſical Talent was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt, and he was then a very good Painter. Now
I could not help forming a Notion in my own Mind, that as our Ideas depend on
the Fibres of the Brain, it was poſſible we might by the continual Uſe of
ſome particular one, weaken it ſo as to make it periſh; and at the ſame
time, another might exert from that very Cauſe itſelf with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Strength. Thus, I ſuppoſe, when this Gentleman's muſical Fibres
periſhed, his painting ones ſhot forth with Vigour. If there be any Truth
in this Whim of mine, which, I own, I am fond of believing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, we may
eaſily account for the various Diſpoſitions which we meet with, even in
the ſame Perſon at different Periods of Life.</p>
            <p>But to return. Altho' it is not in my Power to give a ſuccinct
Account of the Dean's Life, neither have I any intention to attempt it, yet I
believe I am better qualified to do it, than moſt of thoſe who have
undertaken it, as they were abſolute <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0095100801:79"/> Strangers to him,
and relate Things upon Hearſay. The Dean, for the latter Part of his Life,
contracting his Acquaintance into a very narrow Compaſs, for as he was
fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deaf, he thought this Infirmity made him troubleſome, and
therefore kept no Company but ſuch as he could be ſo free with, as to bid
them ſpeak loud, or repeat what they had ſaid; it was owing to this, that
Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> and I frequently paſſed whole Days with him, while
Numbers of our betters were excluded; and as he was like another
<hi>Neſtor,</hi> full of Days and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo like him, he was pretty
much upon the Narrative, than which nothing could be more delightful to me, as
Pleaſure and Inſtruction flowed from his Lips: 
<q>His Words 
<l>Drew Audience, and Attention ſtill as Night</l> 
                  <l>Or Summer's Noontide Air.</l>
                  <bibl>MIL.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I remember in one of theſe periodica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Fits of Deafneſs, for they returned

               </gap> in the Morning; he told me when I came 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0095100801:80"/> he had found Employment for me; ſo he brought to me out
of his Study a large Book, very finely bound in <hi>Turkey</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and
handſomely gilt; this, ſays he, is a Tranſlation of the Epiſtles of
<hi>Horace,</hi> a Preſent to me from the Author, it is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial good
Cover! But I have a Mind there ſhould be ſomething valuable within ſide
of it; ſo taking out his Penknife, he cut out all the Leaves cloſe to the
inner Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Now, ſays he, I will give theſe what they greatly want, and
put them all into the Fire. He then brought out two Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers filled with
Letters: Your Taſk, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is to paſte in theſe Letters, in this Cover,
in the Order I ſhall give them to you; I intended to do it myſelf, but that
I thought it might be a pretty Amuſement for a Child, ſo I ſent for you.
I told him, I was extremely proud to be honoured with his Commands: But, Sir,
may I preſume to make a Requeſt to you, yes, ſays he, but ten to one I
ſhall deny it. I hope not, Sir, it is this; may I have leave to read the
Letters as I go on? Why, provided you will acknowledge yourſelf amply
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0095100801:81"/> for your Trouble, I do not much care if I
indulge you ſo far; but are you ſure you can read? I do not know, Sir, I
will try. Well then begin with this: It was a Letter from Lord
<hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> dated ſix o'Clock in the Morning; it began with a
Remark, how differently that Hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him now riſing cool, ſerene,
and temperate, to contemplate the Beauties of Nature, to what it had done in
ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Parts of his Life, when he was either in the midſt of
Exceſſes, or returning Home ſated with them; ſo he proceeded to
deſcribe the numberleſs Advantages with which Temperance and Virtue bleſs
their Votaries, and the Miſeries which attend a contrary Courſe. The
Epiſtle was pretty long, and the moſt refined Piece of moral Philoſophy I
ever met with, as indeed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his were, and I had the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Delight of reading ſeveral of them.</p>
            <p>Nor can I be at all ſurprized, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould
ſo often celebrate a Genius, who, for Sublimity of Thought, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of
Stile, had few Equals. The reſt of the Dean's Correſpondents were, the 
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0095100801:82"/> Lady <hi>Maſham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Atterbury,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> Lord <hi>Bathurſt,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Addiſon,</hi> Archdeacon <hi>Parnell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Pultney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gay,</hi> Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi>;
a noble and a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Set! So my Readers may judge what a Banquet I had. I
could not avoid remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Dean, that notwithſtanding the Friendſhip
Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> profeſſed for Mr. <hi>Gay,</hi> he could not forbear a
great many ſatirical, or, if I may be allowed to ſay ſo, envious Remarks
on the Succeſs of the <hi>Beggar's Opera.</hi> The Dean very frankly owned,
he did not think Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> was ſo candid to the Merits of other
Writers, as he ought to be. I then ventured to aſk the Dean, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he
thought the Lines Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes him with, in the Beginning
of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> were any Compliment to him? <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>

but they are very ſtiff;'—</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Indeed, <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0095100801:83"/> Sir, ſaid I, he is
ſo perfectly a Maſter of harmonious Number, that had his Heart been in the
leaſt affected with his Subject, he muſt have writ better;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'How cold, how forced, are his Lines to you,

            </p>
            <p>Here we ſee the maſterly Poet, and the warm, ſincere,
generous Friend; while he, according to the Character he gives of Mr.
<hi>Addiſon,</hi> damns with faint Praiſe.— 
<q rend="inline">'Well, replied the Dean, I will ſhew you a late
Letter of his to me;'</q> he did ſo; and I own I was ſurprized to find it
filled with low and ungentleman-like Reflections both on Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> and
the two noble Perſons who honoured him with their Patronage after his
Diſappointment at Court. 
<q rend="inline">'Well, Madam, ſaid the Dean, what do you think
of that Letter? (ſeeing I had gone quite through it:)—</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned I, I am ſorry I have
read it; for it gives me Reaſon to think there is no <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0095100801:84"/>
ſuch thing as a ſincere Friend to be met with in the World.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why, replied he, Authors are as jealous of their
Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as Kings, and can no more bear a Rival in the Empire of Wit, than
a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch could in his Dominions.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'But, Sir, ſaid I, here is a <hi>Latin</hi>
Sentence writ in <hi>Italics,</hi> which, I ſuppoſe, means ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
particular; will you be ſo kind to explain it?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'No, replied he, ſmiling,—I will leave
that for your Huſband to do;—I will ſend for him to come and dine
with us, and in the mean time we will go and take a Walk in <hi>Naboth</hi>'s
Vineyard:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Where may that be, pray, Sir?'—</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why a Garden—I cheated one of my Neighbours
out of.'—</q>When we entered the Garden, or rather the Field, which was
ſquare, and incloſed with a Stone Wall, the Dean aſked me how I liked it?

<q rend="inline">'Why pray, ſaid I, where is the Garden?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Look behind you,'</q> ſaid he; I did ſo, and
obſerved the South Wall was lined with Brick, and a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Fruit
Trees planted againſt it, which being then in Bloſſom, looked very
beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0095100801:85"/> 
               <q rend="inline">'What are you ſo intent on, ſaid the
Dean?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'The opening Blooms, Sir, which brought
<hi>Waller</hi>'s Lines to my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:— 
<q>

            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'Oh! replied he, you are in a poetical Vein; I
thought you had been taking Notice of my Wall, it is the beſt in
<hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; when the Maſons were building it, (as moſt Tradeſmen
are Rogues) I watched them very cloſe, and as often as they could, they put
in a rotten Stone, of which however, I took no Notice, till they had built
three or four Perches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it; now as I am an abſolute Monarch in the

thrown down to the Place where I obſerved the rotten Stone, and by doing ſo
five or ſix Times, the Workmen were at laſt convinced it was their
Intereſt to be honeſt;'</q> or elſe, Sir, ſaid I, your Wall 
<q rend="inline">'would have been as tedious a Piece of 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0095100801:86"/> Work as <hi>Penelope</hi>'s Web, if all that was done in
the Day was to be undone at Night:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Well, anſwered he, I find you have Poetry for
every Occaſion; but as you cannot keep Pace with me in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; (for indeed
I was not quite ſo light then, as I had been ſome Months before) I would
have you ſit down on that little Bank, till you are reſted or I tired, to
put us more upon a Par.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſeated myſelf, and away the Dean walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or rather trolled,
as hard as ever he could drive. I could not help ſmiling at his odd Gait, for
I thought to myſelf, he had written to ſo much in Praiſe of Horſes,
that he was reſolved to imitate them as nearly as he could: As I was
indulging this Fancy, the Dean returned to me, and gave me a ſtrong
Confirmation of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality to thoſe Animals; 
<q rend="inline">'I have been conſidering, Madam, as I walked,
ſaid he, what a Fool Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> was to marry you, for he could
have afforded to keep a Horſe for leſs Money than you coſt him, and that,
you muſt confeſs, would have given him better Exerciſe and 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0095100801:87"/> more Pleaſure than a Wife:—Why you laugh, and do
not anſwer me—is not it Truth?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'I muſt anſwer you, Sir, with another
Queſtion; Pray how can a Batchelor judge of this Matter?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'I find, ſaid he, you are vain enough to give
yourſelf the Preference:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'I do, Sir, to that Species here, a
<hi>Huyoniam,</hi> I would, as becomes me, give Place to: But, Sir, it is going
to rain;'—</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'I hope not, ſaid he, for that will coſt me
Six-pence for a Coach for you, (this Garden being at ſome Diſtance from his
Houſe) come, haſte: O how the Teſter trembles in my Pocket!'</q> I
obeyed, and we got in a Doors juſt Time enough to eſcape a heavy Shower. 
<q rend="inline">'Thank God, ſaid the Dean, I have ſaved my
Money; here, you Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, (to his Servant) carry this Six-pence to the lame old
Man that ſells Ginger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread at the Corner, becauſe he tries to do
ſomething, and does not beg.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean ſhewed me into a little Street-Parlour, (where ſat
his Houſekeeper, a matron-like Gentlewoman at Work) 
<q rend="inline">'Here, ſays he, Mrs. <hi>Brent,</hi> take Care
of this <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0095100801:88"/> Child, meaning me) and ſee ſhe does no
Miſchief, while I take my Walk out within Doors:'</q> The Deanery-Houſe has
I know not how many Pair of Back-Stairs in it; the preceding Dean who built it
being, it ſeems, extremely fearful of Fire, was reſolved there ſhould be
many Ways to eſcape in caſe of Danger.</p>
            <p>The Dean then ran up the Great-Stairs, down one Pair of
Back-Stairs, up another, in ſo violent a Manner, that I could not help
expreſſing my Uneaſineſs to the good Gentlewoman, leſt he ſhould
fall, and be hurted; ſhe ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'It was a cuſtomary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe with him, when
the Weather did not permit him to walk abroad.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I told Mrs. <hi>Brent,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">'I believed the Dean was extremely
charitable;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replied ſhe, No body can be
more ſo; his Income is not above ſix hundred Pounds a Year, and every Year
he gives above the Half of it in private Penſions to decayed Families;
beſides this, he keeps five hundred Pounds in the conſtant Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the
induſtrious Poor: This he lends out in five Pounds at a Time, and 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0095100801:89"/> takes the Payment back at twelve Pence a Week; this does
them more Service, than if he gave it to them entirely, as it obliges them to
work, and at the ſame Time keeps up this charitable Fund for the
Aſſiſtance of many. You cannot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine what Numbers of poor Tradeſmen,
who have even wanted proper Tools to carry on their Work, have by this ſmall
Loan, been put into a proſperous Way, and brought up their Families in
Credit. The Dean, added ſhe, has found out a new Method of being charitable,
in which however, I believe, he will have but few Followers; which is, to debar
himſelf of what he calls the Superfluities of Life, in order to adminiſter
to the Neceſſities of the Diſtreſſed; you juſt now ſaw an
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, the Money a Coach would have coſt him, he gave to a poor
Man, unable to walk; when he dines alone, he drinks a Pint of Beer, and gives
away the Price of a Pint of Wine; and thus he acts in numberleſs
Inſtances.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>My Reader will, I hope, do me the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to believe I was
quite charmed with this <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0095100801:90"/> Account of the Dean's beneficent
Spirit; and I no longer wondered ſo many of the Clergy endeavoured to
depreciate him; for, as it is well known, there are not, in the general, a more
voluptuous Set of Men living, this Doctrine of <hi>Self-denial.</hi> was enough
to make them pour out all their Anathema's on him, and brand him with the Name
of <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> Unbeliever, and ſuch like Terms, as they in their
Chriſtian Zeal thought proper to beſtow.</p>
            <p>I before admired the Dean as a Perſon of diſtinguiſhed
Genius, but now I learned to revere him as the Angel of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The
Dean running into the Parlour, threw a whole Packet of Manuſcript Poems into
my Lap, and ſo he did for five or ſix Times ſucceſſively, till I had
an Apron full of Wit and Novelty, (for they were all of his own Writing,) and
ſuch as had not then been made public, and many of them, I believe, never
will. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> coming, according to the Dean's Deſire, to
Dinner, found me deeply engaged, and ſat down to partake of my Entertainment,
till we were ſummoned to Table, to a leſs <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0095100801:91"/> noble Part. 
<q rend="inline">'Well, Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> ſaid the Dean, I
hope you are jealous; I have had your Wife a good many Hours, and as ſhe is a
likely Girl, and I a very young Man, (<hi>Note,</hi> he was upwards of
Threeſcore) you do not know what may have happened: Tho' I muſt tell you,
you are very partial to her; for here I have not been acquainted with her above
ſix Months, and I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcovered two intolerable Faults in her;
'tis true, I looked ſharp, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they might have eſcaped my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice:
Nay, Madam, do not look ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, I am reſolved to tell your
Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that he may break you of them.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Sir, returned I, my Surprize is, that you
have not found out two and fifty in half that time; but let me know them, and I
will mend of them, if I can.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Well put in, ſays he, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you can't;
but eat your Dinner, however, for they are not capital.'</q> I obeyed, yet was
very impatient to know my particular Errors; he told me, 
<q rend="inline">'I ſhould hear of them Time enough.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0095100801:92"/>The Things being taken away; 
<q rend="inline">'Now, good Sir, ſaid I, tell me what I do
amiſs, that I may reform;'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'No, returned he; but I'll tell your Huſband
before your Face to ſhame you the more:—In the firſt Place, Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> ſhe had the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence this Morning, not only to
deſire to read the Writings of the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Genius's of the Age, in
which I indulged her; but ſhe muſt alſo, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, pretend to praiſe
or cenſure them,' as if ſhe knew ſomething of the Matter; indeed her
Remarks were not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, conſidering they were Gueſs-Work; but this
Letter here of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s ſhe has abſolutely condemned; read it,
(he did ſo;) take notice of it, ſaid the Dean; ſhe would alſo have had
me explain that <hi>Latin</hi> Sentence to her, but I had ſome Modeſty,
tho' ſhe had none you ſee.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why, Sir, ſaid I, ſure Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>
would not (eſpecially to you) write any thing which even a Virgin might not
read.'</q> Now, Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">'ſaid the Dean, is her Curioſity at work; I'll
be hang'd if ſhe lets you ſleep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night till you have ſatisfied it. But
this <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0095100801:93"/> is not all; ſhe had the Vanity to affirm, that
ſhe thought herſelf preferable to a Horſe, and more capable of giving you
pleaſure: Nay, ſhe laugh'd in my Face for being of a different Opinion; and
aſked me how a Batchelor ſhould know any thing of the Matter? If you don't
take down her Pride, there will be no bearing her.'</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> 'tis
your Fault that ſhe is ſo conceited; ſhe was always diſpoſed to be
ſaucy, but ſince you have done her the honour to take notice of her, and
make her your Companion, there is no ſuch thing as mortifying her.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Very fine, ſaid the Dean, I have got much by
complaining to you, to have all your Wife's Faults laid at my Door.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Well, Sir, ſaid I; all theſe Miſdemeanors
may be included under the Article of <hi>Pride:</hi> Now, let me know my other
Crime:'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why, ſaid he, you can't walk faſt; but at
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I excuſe you.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Well, Sir, if I can't mend my Pride, I'll try to
mend my Pace.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> ſaid he, I 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0095100801:94"/> 'have a mind to clip your Wife's Wit.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Sir, ſaid I, that's Death by Law, for
'tis Sterling.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Shut up your Mouth, for all Day, <hi>Letty,</hi>
ſaid Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> for that Anſwer is real Wit.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">Nay, 'ſaid the Dean, I believe we had better
ſhut up our own, for at this rate ſhe'll be too many for us.'</q> I am
ſure, if I was not proud before, this was enough to make me ſo.</p>
            <p>The Dean gueſſed right, when he ſaid, I would not let Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> ſleep till he had explained to me the <hi>Latin</hi>
Sentence in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Letter; which, at my Requeſt, he did. And,
indeed, none but ſuch a wicked Wit could have contrived to turn the Words of
our bleſſed Saviour, ſo as to make them convey a very impure, as well as
a moſt uncharitable, Idea to the Mind.</p>
            <p>Feuds ran ſo high between my Mother and Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi>
that my Life became very unhappy. So we determined to quit my Father's Houſe
for a little one of our own, which my Huſband's Father made us a Preſent
of; and which, by the Bounty of our Friends, who came a Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warming 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0095100801:95"/> to us, was ſoon elegantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; there was a
large Garden to it, which Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> laid out in a moſt beautiful
Taſte, and built a delightful Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-houſe in it, fit indeed for a
Nobleman; here we uſually entertained our Friends; here alſo we both
invoked the Muſe. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> coming in Curate, (by the Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> to a Living, of whoſe Behaviour to me in my
Misfortunes, I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak) and by having the Honour of
being Chaplain to Lady <hi>Charlemont,</hi> with an annual Allowance I had from
my Father, our Income was about one hundred Pounds a Year; ſo that having no
Rent to pay, and having my Father's Coach and Table always at our Command, we
could, in ſo cheap a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as <hi>Ireland,</hi> live in a very decent
Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; as Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> mentions our doing in a Letter of his to Mr.
<hi>Pope,</hi> now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed amongſt others.</p>
            <p>The Dean came to dine with us in our <hi>Lilliputian</hi> Palace,
as he called it, and who could have thought it? He juſt looked into the
Parlour, and ran up into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0095100801:96"/> then into my
Bed-chamber and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and from thence down to the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen; and well it was
for me that the Houſe was very clean; for he compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented me on it, and told
me, 
<q rend="inline">'That was his Cuſtom; and that 'twas from the
Cleanlineſs of the Garret and Kitchen he judged of the good Houſewifery of
the Miſtreſs of the Houſe; for no doubt, but a Slut would have the Rooms
clean, where the Gueſts were to be entertained.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>He really was ſometimes very rude, even to his Superiors, of
which the following Story, related to me by himſelf, may ſerve as one
Inſtance amongſt a thouſand others.</p>
            <p>The laſt time he was in <hi>London,</hi> he went to dine with
the Earl of <hi>Burlington,</hi> who was then but newly married. My Lord being
willing, I ſuppoſe, to have ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, did not introduce him to
his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor mention his Name: 'Tis to be obſerved, his Gown was generally
very ruſty, and his Perſon no way extraordinary.—After Dinner, ſaid
the Dean, 
<q rend="inline">'Lady <hi>Burlington,</hi> I hear you can ſing;
ſing me a Song.'</q> The Lady looked on this <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0095100801:97"/>
unceremonious manner of aſking a Favour with Diſtaſte, and poſitively
refuſed him. He ſaid, ſhe ſhould ſing, or he would make her. 
<q rend="inline">'Why, Madam, I ſuppoſe you take me for one of
your poor paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hedge Parſons; ſing, when I bid
you.'</q> As the Earl did nothing but laugh at this Freedom, the Lady was ſo
vexed that ſhe burſt into Tears, and retired.</p>
            <p>His firſt Compliment to her, when he ſaw her again, was, 
<q rend="inline">'Pray, Madam, are you as proud and as ill-natured
now, as when I ſaw you laſt?'</q> To which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with great
good Humour,— 
<q rend="inline">'No, Mr. Dean; I'll ſing for you, if you
pleaſe.'</q>—From which time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great Eſteem for her. But
who that knew him would take offence at his Bluntneſs? It ſeems Queen
<hi>Caroline</hi> did not, if we may credit his own Lines, wherein he declares,
That he

hear from me ſome of the Dean's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as he has not quite eſcaped
Cenſure, on account of his Gallantries; but here I am not able to oblige my
Reader, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too far advanced in Years, when I firſt had the honour of
being known to him, for Amuſements of that kind. I make no doubt but he has
often been the Object of Love, and his <hi>Cadenus</hi> and
<hi>Vaneſſa</hi> ſeem to aſſure us, that he was the Favourite of one
Lady; but to ſpeak my Sentiments, I really believe it was a Paſſion he
was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unacquainted with, and which he would have thought it beneath the
Dignity of his Wiſdom to entertain. Not that I ever imagined he was an Enemy
to the Fair; for when he found them docile, he took great pleaſure to
inſtruct them: And if I have any Merit, as a Writer, I muſt gratefully
acknowledge it due to the pains he took to teach me to think and ſpeak with
Propriety; tho', to tell the Truth, he was a very rough ſort of a Tutor for
one of my Years and Sex; for whenever <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0095100801:115"/> I made uſe of an
inelegant Phraſe, I was ſure of a deadly Pinch, and frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Chaſtiſement before I knew my Crime. However I am convinced, had he thought
me incorrigibly dull, I ſhould have eſcaped without Correction; and the
black and blue Favours I received at his Hands, were meant for Merit, tho'
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on me. Yet tho', to my Shame I own it, I was fond of Admiration to
a Fault, and a little too much upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette, for a married Woman, I would
at any Time give up any Pleaſure or Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the more rationaln
Etertainment of the Dean's Converſation.</p>
            <p>Five Years rolled inſenſibly away in a Kind of tolerable
Happineſs, as Lady <hi>Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> terms it; but that it ſeems, I was not
much longer to enjoy: However, before I begin to ſpeak of Offence and
Trouble, I ſhall endeavour to enliven my Narration with all the little
amuſing Incidents I can poſſibly recollect.</p>
            <p>The following Trifle, as it was produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a handſome Letter
to me from the Dean, and of more Honour than I could <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0095100801:116"/>
poſſibly expect from it, my Vanity will not let me omit. My Brother teized
me one Evening to write ſome Verſe as a School Exerciſe for him, I
aſked him what I ſhould write upon; Why, ſaid he pertly, what ſhould
you write upon but the Paper? So taking it for my Subject, I wrote the

Purpoſe, they lay careleſsly on the Table, when a Lady of Diſtinction,

never thought more of them.</p>
            <p>About four Years after this, making a Viſit to Baron

the Good of the Company; but how great was my Surprize, to find they were the
above Lines! however, I went through my Taſk, and Mrs. <hi>Wainwright</hi>
aſked my Opinion of them, and ſeemed impatient at my Silence. I told her,
the young Lady muſt have wrote them at leaſt four Years before, becauſe I
had ſeen them ſo long ago. Upon which the Baron ſaid, that he alſo
remembered them, and that he was told by the Perſon he ſaw them with, 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0095100801:118"/> that they were writ by a very young Girl, who was
married to a Clergyman in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> My ſmiling made them gueſs at

praiſe them. When I returned home, I found a Letter from Mr.

wherein the above Poem was printed. I related this to the Dean, who ordered me
to ſend the Lines to him. The next Morning a Lady came to viſit me, who
told me, it being the Dean's Birth-Day, he had received a Book very richly

which I never ſaw better in their Kind; I have the ſame Opinion of thoſe
you were pleaſed to write upon me, as have alſo ſome particular Friends
of Genius and Taſte, to whom I ventured to communicate them, who
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally agree with me. But as I cannot with Decency ſhew them except
to a very few, I hope, for both our Sakes, others will do it for me. I can only
aſſure you I value your Preſent, as much as either of the others, only
you muſt permit it to be turned into a Pen, which Office I will 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0095100801:121"/> perform with my own Hand, and never permit any other to
uſe it. I heartily wiſh you many happy New Years, and am with true
Eſteem,</p>

            <p>But as I have mentioned Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s being in
<hi>London,</hi> I ought alſo to inform my Reader what Inducement he had to
quit his Family for a whole Year, which was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Dr. <hi>Swift</hi>
had, in Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s Reign, been the firſt Promoter of Alderman
<hi>Barber,</hi> who afterwards by many lucky Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents roſe to be Lord
Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> which Station he filled with diſtinguiſhed
Abilities, and retained ſo grateful a Senſe of the Dean's Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ur to him, that he made him the
Compliment of nominating a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to him; the Dean offered this Honour to
Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> who gladly accepted of <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0095100801:122"/> it, and
came home in high Spirits to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with his Preferment; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Joy it brought to him, I was quite ſunk in Sorrow at the Thoughts of parting
for ſo long a Time with one I ſo dearly loved. All his Friends were
againſt his going; and the late Primate Dr. <hi>Hoadly,</hi> then
Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> remonſtrated to him, that ſerving under a
Perſon ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably diſaffected as the Alderman, might very probably
prejudice him in the Eyes of the Government; but all in vain. Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> was ever raſh, obſtinate, and ſelf-willed; and
ſhould I add treacherous, cruel, and ungrateful, I ſhould not wrong the
Truth; but however unwilling I am to ſpeak harſhly of the Huſband of my
Youth, and the Father of my Children, I muſt draw his Character, wherein I
will 
<q> 
                  <l>—Nothing extenuate,</l> 
                  <l>Nor ſet down aught in
Malice.</l>
                  <bibl>Othello.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That he is both a Scholar, and a Man of Genius, all who know him
muſt allow; but like Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> he is ſo plagued with Envy, 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0095100801:123"/> that he even hated me becauſe I could write, and took
an invincible Averſion to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor <hi>Smith,</hi> becauſe he excelled
him on the Harpſichord. It happened one Evening that this Gentleman ſung
and played to us the Oratorio of Queen <hi>Eſther</hi>; unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for me
I was ſo charmed with it, that at the Concluſion of the Muſic I wrote the
following Lines.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As the Lines were wrote off-hand, as, to ſay the Truth, every
Thing of mine is, for I am too volatile to reviſe or correct any thing I
write, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> complimented Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> on having a Wife
who could write better than himſelf, he ſuppoſing Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>
to be ſo much the Lover, that he would be delighted with my Praiſe, and
join in it. But, lack-a-day! he little knew what I was to ſuffer for the
Superiority of Genius he was pleaſed to aſcribe to me. I then was
continually told with a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous jibing Air, O my Dear! a Lady of your
Accompliſhments! why Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſays you write better than I; and
to be ſure he is a great Judge! But another unlucky Accident likewiſe
happened: How fatal to me has Praiſe been! We ſupped at the 
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0095100801:125"/> Dean's, and I had been reading out, by his Command,
ſome of his proſaic Work; he was pleaſed to ſay I acquitted myſelf
ſo well, that I ſhould have a Glaſs of his beſt Wine, and ſent Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> to the Cellar for it. The Dean in the mean Time ſaid to
me, 
<q rend="inline">'I would have every Man write his own
<hi>Engliſh.</hi>'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'To be ſure, Sir, ſaid I, that would be
beſt.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Ay, to be ſure, Sir; you give me an Anſwer,
and P—x take you, I am ſure you do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand my Meaning.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Very poſſible, Sir; but I certainly
underſtand my own, when I have any.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Well then, what do you underſtand by writing
one's own <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh?</hi>'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why really, Sir, not to confine one's ſelf to a
Set of Phraſes, as ſome of our antient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians,
<hi>Camden</hi> in particular, ſeems to have done, but to make uſe of
ſuch Words as naturally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur on the Subject.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Huſh! ſays he, your Huſband is coming; I
will put the ſame Queſtion to him.'</q> He did ſo; and Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> anſwered, 
<q rend="inline">'To be ſure a Man ought to write good
<hi>Engliſh.</hi>'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Nay, but his own <hi>Engliſh</hi>; I ſay his
own; <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0095100801:126"/> what do you underſtand by that?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why, Sir, ſaid he, what ſhould I

               <q rend="inline">'P—x on you for a Dunce, ſaid he; were

            </p>
            <p>And now my Buſineſs was compleatly done. Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> viewed me with ſcornful, yet with jealous Eyes. And tho' I
never preſumed to vye with him for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, well knowing he not only
ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me in natural Talents, but alſo had the Advantage of having
thoſe Talents im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Learning; and was ſenſible the Compliments I
received were rather paid to me as a Woman, in whom any thing a Degree above
Ignorance appears ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than to any Merit I really poſſeſſed;
he thought proper to inſult me every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Indeed he did not beat me,
which ſome of the good-natured Ladies have brought as an Argument that he was
an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Huſband; but how a Clergyman ſhould ſtrike a Wife, who
never contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted him, and who was the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably gentle, even of her
own ſoft Sex, I <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0095100801:127"/> know not. Beſides, I had then a dear
and honoured Father to protect me. I am ſure I may ſay with
<hi>Ophelia,</hi> 
               <q> 
                  <l>My Violets all wither'd when he dy'd.</l>
               </q> Then was I left
defenceleſs to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries my Huſband's ſubtle Cruelty could
deviſe againſt open unſuſpecting Innocence.</p>
            <p>Another trivial Accident alſo offended my Huſband. He was one
Winter's Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning reading <hi>Horace,</hi> and ſaid he would engage to write
an Ode exactly in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſo he directly ſet about it. The Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy came
into my Head to write one alſo, though I underſtood not a Word of
<hi>Latin,</hi> nor knew no more of the Poet than from the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Tranſlations. My Lines were as follow:

                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As I had finiſhed my Taſk firſt, I ſhewed it to Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> who, contrary to my Expectation, (for I imagined he would
be pleaſed) was very angry, and told me the Dean had made me mad, that the
Lines were Nonſenſe, and that a Needle became <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0095100801:129"/> a
Woman's Hand better than a Pen and Ink. So to bring him into Temper I praiſed
his Ode highly, and threw my own into the Fire. And here let me ſeriouſly
adviſe every Lady, who has the Misfortune to be poetically turned, never to
marry a Poet, but remember <hi>Swift</hi>'s Lines: 
<q> 
                  <lg>
                     <l>What Poet wou'd not grieve to ſee</l>
                     <l>His Friends cou'd write as well as he;</l>
                     <l>And rather than be thus out-done,</l>
                     <l>He'd hang them every Mother's Son.</l>
                  </lg> 
                  <lg>
                     <l>Her End when Emulation miſſes,</l>
                     <l>She turns to Envy, Stings and Hiſſes;</l>
                     <l>The ſtrongeſt Friendſhip yields to Pride,</l>
                     <l>Unleſs the Odds be on our Side.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And if a Man cannot bear his Friend ſhould write, much leſs
can he endure it in his Wife; it ſeems to ſet them too much upon a Level
with their Lords and Maſters; and this I take to be the true Reaſon why
even Men of Senſe diſcountenance Learning in Women, and commonly chuſe
for Mates the moſt illiterate and ſtupid of the Sex; and 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0095100801:130"/> then bleſs their Stars their Wife is not a Wit.</p>
            <p>But if a Remark be true, which I have ſomewhere read, that <hi>a
fooliſh Woman never brought forth a wiſe Son,</hi> I think the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhould have ſome Regard to the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of thoſe they eſpouſe.</p>
            <p>But to return from this long tho' neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Digreſſion,
and take things a little more in their Order. Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> contrary
to every body's Advice, who had any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for him, went for <hi>England.</hi>
I was very deſirous of going with him; but he told me plainly he did not want
ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance as a Wife, and that he did not intend to paſs there
for a married Man; and that in ſhort he could not taſte any Pleaſure
where I was. As this was a Secret I did not know before, I received it with
Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; for amidſt all his <hi>wayward Moods,</hi> I ever imagined
till then that he loved me, and that the many ill natured Speeches he made me
were rather the Effect of a bad Temper, than any ſettled Averſion he had
taken againſt me; eſpecially as I obſerved he treated every body with
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0095100801:131"/> even Perſons every Way ſuperior to him
(the Dean alone excepted, to whom he paid even a ſervile Complaiſance.) And
tho' he now fairly plucked off the Maſk, and let me ſee my Miſtake, I
could hardly give him Credit; ſo unwilling are we to believe Truth, when it
runs counter to our Wiſhes.</p>
            <p>The next Day he went on board the Yacht in Company with Mr.
<hi>Edward Walpole,</hi> to whom he was recommended by a Man of Quality ſince
dead, and left me and my three Children almoſt without an Adieu: So eagerly
did he ſeek his own Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I am hardly able to deſcribe the various Emotions with which my
Heart was agitated on his Departure. Love, Grief, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment for his
laſt Speech, by Turns poſſeſſed it. However, I received a very kind
Letter from him from <hi>Cheſter,</hi> which made me a little eaſy; and as
my Friends ſeldom permitted me to be alone, I did not give much way to
Melancholy.</p>
            <p>I believe it will be expected from the general Reflections I have
thrown out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Clergy, that I ſhould deſcend to 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0095100801:132"/> Particulars, and expoſe by Name the Guilty; but this
invidious Taſk I muſt decline: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as <hi>Angelo</hi> ſays in
<hi>Meaſure for Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> when he is tempting a Virgin, and ſhe
threatens to expoſe him; 
<q> 
                  <l>Who will believe thee, <hi>Iſabel?</hi>
                  </l> 
                  <l>My unſoil'd Name, th' Auſtereneſs of my Life,</l> 
                  <l>My Intereſt in the State, may vouch againſt you,</l> 
                  <l>That you ſhall ſtifle in your own Report,</l> 
                  <l>And ſmell of Calumny.</l>
               </q> Beſides, I ſhould arm a
formidable Body againſt me, who would not fail, ſooner or later, to take
ample Vengeance. <hi>As unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving as a Churchman,</hi> is become
prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial; ſo, as I am a Sort of a Prieſteſs, I will, like a faithful
Mother-Confeſſor, keep the Secrets of my ghoſtly Brethren.</p>
            <p>I have another Inducement to Silence, not I muſt own quite ſo
good-natured, which is, that I have a malignant Pleaſure in keeping thoſe
in Awe, who awe all the World beſide, which I ſhould loſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0095100801:133"/> I had done my worſt. I remember a certain Gentleman,
who happening to be guilty of a venial Tranſgreſſion with a mean Woman,
it unluckily manifeſted itſelf: The Gentleman was young, and had a very
ſevere Father, who gave him but a ſcanty Allowance, all of which did not
ſatisfy the mercenary Wretch of a Woman, who hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gain more, went and
told her Story to his Father; the Conſequence of which was, that ſhe never
afterwards had a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from either.

            <p>The Innocent cannot take Offence, and for the Guilty, I will for

            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0095100801:134"/>But once more to gather up my Clue. I
received ſo paſſionately tender a Letter from <hi>London</hi> from Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> that I quite forgot all his Unkindneſs; and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down to anſwer it, without the leaſt Intention of Rhyming, the following
Lines flowed from my Pen:

            <p>The Dean had given Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of
Recommendation to ſeveral eminent Perſons in <hi>England,</hi> and
amongſt the reſt, one to Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>; who, no ſooner received it,
but he invited Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> to paſs a Fortnight with him at
<hi>Twickenham,</hi> he not being yet entered on his Office of Chaplain. I
received from him from thence a Letter filled with Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s
Praiſes, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Regard he ſhewed him, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing him to
ſeveral Noblemen, and even oppreſſing him with Civilities, which he
modeſtly attributed to Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Reſpect for the Dean, and
handſomely acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Obligation. As I thought this a very proper
Letter to communicate, I went directly with it to the Deanery. The Dean read it
over with a fix'd Attention, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning it to me, he told me, he had, by
the ſame Pacquet, received a Letter from Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> which, with
ſomewhat of a ſtern Brow, he put into my Hand, and walked 
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0095100801:137"/> out into the Garden. I was ſo ſtartled at his
Auſterity, that I was for ſome Minutes unable to open it, and when I did,
the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents greatly aſtoniſhed me. The Subſtance of it was, that he
had, in pure Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to the Dean, entertained Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>;
but that he was ſurpriſed he ſhould be ſo miſtaken, to recommend him
as a modeſt ingenious Man, who was a moſt forward, ſhallow, conceited
Fellow: That in the Hope of having an agreeable Companion, he had invited him
to paſs a Fortnight with him, which he heartily repented, being ſick of his
Impertinence, before the End of the third Day; and a great deal more, much to
the ſame Purpoſe. By the time I had read it thro', the Dean returned, and
aſked me, what I thought of it? I told him, I was ſure Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> did not deſerve the Character Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> had given
of him; and that he was highly ungenerous to careſs and abuſe him at the
ſame time. Upon this the Dean loſt all Patience, and flew into ſuch a
Rage, that he quite terrified me; he aſked me, Why I did not ſwear that my
Huſband was ſix Foot high? And, Did I <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0095100801:138"/> think myſelf
a better Judge than Mr. <hi>Pope?</hi> or, Did I preſume to give him the Lie?
and a thouſand other Extravagancies. As I durſt not venture to ſpeak a
Word more, my Heart ſwelled ſo that I burſt into Tears, which, he
attributing to Pride and Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made him, if poſſible, ten times
more angry, and I am not ſure he would not have beat me; but that,
fortunately for me, a Gentleman came to viſit him. As I was in a violent
Paſſion of Tears, the Dean did not bring him into the Room where I was, but
went to receive him in another, and I gladly laid hold of that opportunity of
making my eſcape from his Wrath.</p>
            <p>The next Morning early I wrote him a Letter, expreſſive of the
Anxiety I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, leſt I had any way offended him; and aſſured him,
which was Truth, my Tears did not flow from Pride, but from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
I had, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence him to withdraw his Favour from
us. I added on my own Part, that even if I was partial to Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> I hoped it was the moſt pardonable Error a Wife could be
guilty of; and concluded with begging, if <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0095100801:139"/> he had any
Regard for my Peace, he would honour me with an Anſwer. By the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the
Meſſenger I received the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Lines: 
<floatingText type="letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0095100801:140"/>Accordingly I waited on the Dean about five
o'Clock in the Evening, an Hour I knew he would be free from Company. He
received me with great Kindneſs, and told me, he would write a Letter of
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>; 
<q rend="inline">'But, ſaid he, ſhould you acquaint him with
this Letter of <hi>Pope</hi>'s, he might, perhaps, reſent it to him, and make
him an Enemy.'</q> How kind! how conſiderate was this! The Dean then ſhewed
me the Poem he wrote on his own Death; when I came to that Part of it, 
<q> 
                  <l>Behold the fatal Day arrive!</l> 
                  <l>How is the Dean? He's juſt alive.</l>
               </q> I was ſo
ſenſibly affected, that my Eyes filled with Tears: The Dean obſerving it,
ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'Phoo, I am not dead yet—but you ſhall not
read any more now.'</q> I then earneſtly requeſted he would let me take it
home with me, which he did on certain Conditions, which were, that I ſhould
neither ſhew it to any body, nor copy it, and that I ſhould ſend it to
him <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0095100801:141"/> by Eight o'Clock the next Morning; all which I
punctually performed.</p>
            <p>But the Dean did not know what ſort of a Memory I had, when he
intruſted me with his Verſe: I had no occaſion for any other Copy, than
what I had regiſtred in the <hi>Book and Volume of my Brain:</hi> I could
repeat the whole Poem, and could not forbear delighting ſome particular
Friends with a Rehearſal of it. This reached the Dean's Ear, who imagined I
plaid him falſe, and ſent for me to come to him. When I entered, he told
me, I had broke my Word with him, and conſequently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all the good
Opinion he had ever conceived of me. I looked, as I think he generally made me
do, like a Fool; I aſked what I had done? He told me, I had copied his Poem,
and ſhewn it round the Town. I aſſured him, I had not. He ſaid I lyed,
and produced a Poem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it, publiſhed in <hi>London,</hi> and
told me, from reading it about, that odd Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque on it had taken riſe.
He bade me read it, aloud. I did ſo, and could not forbear laughing, as I
plainly perceived, <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0095100801:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> tho' he had endeavoured to
diſguiſe his Stile, that the Dean had burleſqued himſelf; and made no
manner of ſcruple to tell him ſo. He pretended to be very angry, aſked
me, did I ever know him write Triplets? and told me, I had neither Taſte nor
Judgment, and knew no more of Poetry than a Horſe. I told him I would
confeſs it, provided he would ſeriouſly give me his Word, he did not
write that Poem. He ſaid, P—x take me for a Dunce. I then aſſured
him, I did not copy his Poem; but added, when I read any thing peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charming, I never forgot it; and that I could repeat not only all his Works,
but all <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s, which I put to this Trial; I deſired him to
open any Part of it, and read a Line, and I would engage to go on with the
whole Speech; as we were in his Library, he directly made the Experiment: The
Line he firſt gave me, he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely picked out for its ſingular
Oddneſs: 
<q> 
                  <l>But rancours in the Veſſel of my Peace.</l> 
                  <bibl>Macbeth.</bibl>
               </q> 
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0095100801:143"/> I readily went
on with the whole Speech, and did ſo ſeveral times, that he tried me with
different Plays. The Dean then took down <hi>Hudibras,</hi> and ordered me to
examine him in it, as he had done me in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>; and, to my great
Surprize, I found he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered every Line, from Beginning to End of it. I
ſay, it ſurprized me, becauſe I had been miſled by Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s
Remark, 
<q> 
                  <l>That where Beams of warm Imagination play,</l> 
                  <l>The Memory's ſoft Figures melt away.</l> 
                  <bibl>Eſſay on Criticiſm.</bibl>
               </q> To think Wit and
Memory incompatible things. I told the Dean he had convinced me the old Proverb
was falſe; and, indeed, I know not how any Perſon can be witty without a
good Memory. When I returned home, I found I had not been miſtaken in the
Opinion I had conceived, that the Dean had burleſqued his own Poem. I had a
Confirmation of it in a Letter from Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> to whom he had
ſent it, to have it printed in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0095100801:144"/>My Evening's Chat with the Dean fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
me with Matter of Speculation on that moſt amazing Faculty of the human Mind,
Memory; which, according to my uſual Cuſtom, I threw into Rhime, and hope
it will not be diſpleaſing to my Reader.

            <p>My Reader may now plainly perceive, I was moſt incorrigibly
devoted to Verſifying, and all my Spouſe's wholeſome Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had no
manner of Effect on me: In ſhort, I believe this ſcribbling Itch is an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Diſeaſe; for tho' <hi>Horace</hi> ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Art of Poetry.</note>, taking ſome Phyſic in the
Spring rid him <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0095100801:147"/> of it, yet, as he even relates this in
flowing Numbers, we have no Cauſe to give him Credit. He alſo declares, all
Poets are viſibly poſſeſſed, and mad. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ſeems
to be of the ſame opinion, tho' he deſcribes it with greater Elegance than
even <hi>Horace</hi> has done, at leaſt in the Tranſlation. 
<q> 
                  <l>The Poet's Eye, in a fine Frenzy rolling,</l> 
                  <l>Doth glance from Heav'n to Earth, from Earth to Heav'n;</l> 
                  <l>And as Imagination bodies forth</l> 
                  <l>The Forms of Things unknown, the Poet's Pen</l> 
                  <l>Turns them to Shapes, and gives to airy Nothing</l> 
                  <l>A local Habitation and a Name.</l>
               </q> The Truth of which he
has fully verified, giving us in his divine Works a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own,
with a new Language alſo peculiar to the different Species and Orders of
Beings he introduces to us. <hi>Milton</hi> had, ſtudied him with Care, and,
like the Bee, committed many ſweet Thefts on his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Blooms. Whoever
reads the Part <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0095100801:148"/> of the Fairies in the <hi>Midſummer
Night's Dream,</hi> may eaſily perceive how many beautiful Images
<hi>Milton</hi> has borrowed thence to adorn his Maſque of <hi>Comus.</hi>
And really, I think, as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> had plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all Art and
Nature, the viſible and inviſible World, it was but juſt to make

            <p>I hope my Reader will pardon me for ſo often running away from
<hi>myſelf</hi>; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, I am <hi>Egotiſt</hi> enough to be much
enamoured of ſuch an unhappy Theme, and have often wiſhed I could do it in
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for I have been plunged in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, that I have even thought
it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be true, and vainly hoped to wake, as from ſome hideous
Dream, to find a better Fate.</p>
            <p>And as one travelling in a barren Waſte, could not be
diſpleaſed to be ſometimes led out of the direct Road to view a more
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Proſpect, I deal thus with my Readers, and turn them from the
gloomy Vale of my Life, to relieve them with ſomething more pleaſing.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> who loved me beſt at a Diſtance, wrote
me a very kind Letter, wherein he told me my Verſes were like myſelf, full
of Elegance and Beauty; that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> and others, whom he had ſhewn
them to, longed to ſee the Writer; and that he heartily wiſhed me in
<hi>London.</hi> And this put the Fancy into my Head of going there; and as
ſome of my Acquaintance intended for it, with whom I thought I could
agreeably travel, I ſoon reſolved to accompany them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> had been abſent nine Months; a tedious
Time in a Lover's Reckoning. In three Months Time his Office expired; for every
new Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> has a new Chaplain; ſo I thought I ſhould
have the Pleaſure of paſſing the Winter in <hi>London,</hi> and then, if
nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0095100801:161"/> offered, we ſhould return home
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>London</hi> has very attractive Charms for moſt People, as our
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry ſufficiently evidence, by ſpending the
greateſt Part of their Time and Fortune there; and can it be wondered at,
that a young lively Woman ſhould be fond of taking the only Opportunity ſhe
might ever have of ſeeing its Magnificence in Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Well! but how to
execute my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for I was apprehenſive if either my own Parents or Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi>'s were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, they would prevent me; ſo I
reſolved to make but one Confidante, which was a very faithful Servant, who
in the Evening put my Portmanteau aboard the Yacht. Next Morning, the Wind
being fair, I went, under Pretence of ſeeing my Friends ſafe aboard, down
the River with them, and into the Ship as it were out of Curioſity; but being
then out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Purſuit, I told them my Intention, which ſome
approved of, and ſome blamed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
However, as I did not queſtion a kind Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ception from my Huſband, and knew
my Children would be well taken care of by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0095100801:162"/> Parents, I was very chearful and eaſy, and
little regarded what was thought of my Frolick; neither could I divine that any
evil Conſtruction would be put upon it.</p>
            <p>We had a very ſafe Paſſage, and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Journey. I
wrote to Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> from <hi>Parkgate,</hi> and he and Mr.
<hi>W—e</hi> met me about four Miles Diſtance from <hi>London.</hi> So
I took leave of my Fellow-Travellers for the preſent, and went into the Coach
to them, which drove to Mr. <hi>W—le</hi>'s. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>
received me very obligingly, and called me his little Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive and Run-away;
but a Stranger would have thought Mr. <hi>W—le</hi> was my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he
welcomed me ſo kindly, and paid me ſo many Compliments. As I had been up at
three o'Clock in the Morning, I was heartily fatigued, and deſired Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> to take leave; but he whiſpered me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Mr.
<hi>W—le</hi> home to Supper with us, which accordingly I did; and he was
ſo tranſported with this Civility, he could not conceal his Joy; whatever I
commended amongſt his Paintings, he would force me to accept of; and putting
as many Bottles <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0095100801:163"/> of Wine into the Coach-Box as it would
conveniently hold, we went to Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s Lodging, which I found
very handſome and convenient. Wine and good Chear enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained us till
Midnight to our mutual Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> and I were alone, he told me, that
tho' he was very glad to ſee me, he was afraid I would have but a lonely Time
of it in <hi>London,</hi> he being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to attend on the Lord Mayor, from
Nine in the Morning till Six in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and from thence he always went to
the Play, and afterwards to Supper to Mrs. <hi>Heron,</hi> one of the
Actreſſes, of no very good Fame. Though I thought this but an odd Manner of
Life for a Clergyman, I did not ſay ſo, being unwilling to offend him. I
had heard it whiſpered, that he liked this Woman, but I reſolved patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to wait the Event.</p>
            <p>The next Day, when he was going out, I put him in Mind that Mr.
<hi>W—le</hi> ſaid he would paſs the Evening with us; but he laughed
at my believing it; and ſaid he was a Man ſo uncertain in his Temper, that
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0095100801:164"/> I might never ſee him again while I lived.
Juſt then a Lady who came over with me, called on us; and Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> and ſhe had ſome private Chat. When ſhe was gone he
told me, ſhe had brought him a Letter and ſome Poetry from the Dean, which
he had ordered him to diſpoſe of, and put the Money in his own Pocket; as
he could not ſtay to read them, he took them with him to the Lord
Mayor's.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> was miſtaken in imagining Mr.
<hi>W—le</hi> would fail in his Appointment; he came and told me Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> was at the Play, but would ſup with us. He made uſe of
his Abſence to compliment me at an unmerciful Rate, and ſung me all the
tendereſt Love Songs he could think of in the moſt pathetic Manner: In
ſhort, he exerted his Talents to entertain me, and behaved himſelf ſo
much in the Stile of a Lover, that had I not been married, I ſhould have
imagined, he intended to addreſs me. When Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> returned, he
told him, he was certainly the happieſt Man living, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how he
could be a Moment out of <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0095100801:165"/> my Company, where he could
ſtay for ever. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> ſeemed much pleaſed with his
Gallantry, and ſaid, he hoped I would induce him to ſee us often. When we
were alone, he told me, he believed his Friend was in love with me. I
anſwered, if he thought ſo, I wondered he gave him ſo warm an Invitation.
He ſaid, he was a very generous Man, and that his liking to me, if well
managed, might prove very profitable; for he valued no Expence where a Lady was
in the Caſe. So, it ſeems, I was to be the Bait, wherewith he was to angle
for Gold out of a Rival's Pocket: A Scheme which had a twofold Proſpect of
Gain annexed to it; for while a Lover has Hope, he ſeldom quits the Chace;
and will even thank the Huſband, for taking the friendly Freedom of uſing
his Purſe; and yet ſhould the Gallant be detected in taking any friendly
Freedoms with the Wife in return, the Law is all againſt him, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and
Impriſonment muſt enſue. Which Conſideration may ſerve as a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all Men, not to invade Properties, or commit wilful Treſpaſs on their
Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0095100801:166"/>If my Readers are by this Time the leaſt
acquainted with my Spirit, they may judge, I looked on this Project with the
Contempt it deſerved; however I promiſed Complaiſance, which indeed Mr.
<hi>W—le</hi>'s ſeeming Merits might well deſerve. The next Day I was
invited to the Lord Mayor's, who, on account of the reſolute Oppoſition he
had given to the Exciſe Act, was the Darling of the People. He was but
indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as to his Perſon, or rather homely than otherwiſe; but he had
an excellent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the Livelineſs of his Genius ſhone in
his Eyes, which were very black and ſparkling. He always treated me with
great Complaiſance, and gave me a general Invitation to his Table. As the
Lord Mayor was a Batchelor, he had a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman who managed his Houſhold
Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and who, except on public Days, did the Honours of his Table. Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> told me ſhe was violently in love with him, and was ready
to run mad upon hearing I was come to <hi>London.</hi> How true this might be I
know not; but as ſhe was very civil to me, and was old enough to 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0095100801:167"/> be my Mother, I was not the leaſt diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with
Jealouſy on her own Account; tho' I can't help ſaying, ſhe gave me a
great deal of Uneaſineſs, by relating to me many Inſtances of my
Huſband's extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Regard for the Player afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: We went
together to the Play on Purpoſe to ſee her; and to do her Juſtice, ſhe
was a graceful, fine Woman; at leaſt ſhe appeared ſuch on the Stage, and
had a peculiar Skill in dreſſing to Advantage. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> and
Mr. <hi>W—le</hi> were at the Play; they met us going out, and Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> committed me to the Care of his Friend, who had a Coach
waiting to convey me home; but Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> went to his old
Rendezvous to the Actreſs, to my very great Mortification; becauſe I really
preferred his Converſation to any other in the World: However, he was ſo
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, he uſed every Evening to ſend Mr. <hi>W—le</hi> to
keep me Company, while he purſued his Pleaſures; and, as I ſhall
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to Heaven, he did every thing in his power to forward and
encourage an Amour between his Friend and me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0095100801:168"/>One Inſtance, out of an hundred I could
produce, I ſubmit to the impartial Judgment of my Reader. One of the young
Ladies, at whoſe Houſe I firſt ſaw Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> happening to
be in <hi>London,</hi> and but in low Circumſtances, came to viſit me;
ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on my paſſing the next Evening with her, and juſt as
I was going Mr. <hi>W—le</hi> came in, and offered to accompany me, to
which I gladly conſented, hoping as he was then a Man of Intereſt, he might
recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her to ſome good Family, as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs to Children, or a
Lady's Woman, when he knew how well qualified ſhe was for either Place. As
her Spirit was far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her Ability, I was concerned to ſee what Expence
ſhe had put herſelf to for my Reception, having provided a very genteel
Supper, to which ſhe would oblige us to ſtay. While ſhe was giving Orders
for it, I informed Mr. <hi>W—le</hi> of her Diſtreſs, who immediately
gave me a Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea for her, but entreated I would give it to her as Preſent
from my ſelf, which, as I knew it was the only Method to make her accept of
it, I did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0095100801:169"/>When I came home, I related to Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> Mr. <hi>W—le</hi>'s obliging and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Behaviour;
but little was he pleaſed with the Recital: What could I think of him, when
he told me, I did very ill to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a new Woman to him, <hi>i. e.</hi> Mr.
<hi>W—le</hi>; and that he hoped I would loſe him; and that henceforth
he would beſtow his Favours on her? A Speech more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Mouth of
one of thoſe aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Wretches, who live by the Sale of the Innocent, than
for a Huſband, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and one who ought to be a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. But I
believe he was of Opinion that 
<q> 
                  <l>Let the malicious World ſay what it pleaſe,</l> 
                  <l>The fair Wife makes her Huſband live at eaſe.</l>
               </q> And,
provided he ſold me well, and <hi>put Money in his Purſe,</hi> little
regarded either my temporal or eternal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Another Inſtance either of his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Confidence in my
Fidelity to him, or rather Indifference about it, was, that 
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0095100801:170"/> he obliged me to go alone with his Friend to
<hi>Windſor,</hi> though, as it was Winter, there was no Poſſibility of
going there and returning the ſame Day, it being twenty Miles diſtant from
<hi>London</hi>; ſo that we had not only two Days, but a Night alſo, to
paſs together. Could any Huſband be more obliging to his Rival, than to
give him ſuch an Opportunity to accompliſh his Wiſhes? Had mine but
concurred, I had then been undone; for truly the Gentleman tried eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Argument to win me to them, but in vain. My Huſband's Miſconduct in
expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to ſuch Temptation, ſtung me to the Quick; nay, I could not
help believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were both in a Plot to betray me to Ruin; and as we were
at the top Inn in the Town, I ſtarted at every Noiſe of Horſemen who
ſtopped there; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, though falſly I believe, that Mr.
<hi>W—le</hi> had given Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection where to find
us; and as this Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginatlion wholly poſſeſſed me, I little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
either the Elegance of our Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, or the Tenderneſs and Paſſion
the Gentleman expreſſed in every Word <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0095100801:171"/> and Look: His
ſoft Endearments were all loſt on one who regarded him as an Enemy. I was
obſtinately ſullen, and pretended Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, on purpoſe to quit his
Company; but I loſt all Patience, when calling to the Maid to ſhew me to my
Chamber, I found there was but one, nay, and but one Bed too, provided for two
Gueſts; for, it ſeems, my Gentleman had ſo ordered it, hoping, no doubt,
to ſupply my Huſband's Place.</p>
            <p>I was now in a manner convinced, there was Treachery intended
againſt me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached my deſiring Swain in ſuch bitter Terms, that
he had no Way to prove his Innocence, but by retiring, tho' very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly,
to another Apartment; and I took ſpecial Care to barricade my own, not only
double-locking it, but alſo placing all the Chairs and Tables againſt the
Door to prevent a Poſſibility of being ſurprized.</p>
            <p>I roſe very early next Morning to take a Survey of what
Curioſities <hi>Windſor</hi> afforded, as it was too late the Night before
to ſee any thing; but found nothing worth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, except the
Caſtle, whoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Situation and <hi>Gothick</hi> Grandeur, might 
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0095100801:172"/> very well, ſome Ages ago, make it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed a
<hi>Non-pareil:</hi> But as it has frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been deſcribed and celebrated,
I ſhall only ſay, that conſidering it as the Palace of the
<hi>Edwards</hi> and <hi>Henrys,</hi> I was touched with ſomething like a
religious Veneration for it, which no modern Building could inſpire me
with.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>W—le</hi> attended me with great Reſpect, and
excepting that he tenderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me with what he called my Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the
Night before, gave me no farther Cauſe of Diſpleaſure, but brought me
ſafely home in his Chaiſe to Mr. <hi>P—n.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But pray, gentle Reader, ſuppoſe it had happened otherwiſe;
that Night-Solitude, an agreeable and importunate Lover, ſhould have
prevailed on human, yielding Frailty, whom could my Huſband ſo properly
have blamed for it as himſelf? He who beſt knew our Frames, bids us avoid
Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the ſureſt Method, nay and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the only one of
avoiding Sin; for who ſo firm that may not be ſeduced? Why then ſhould
he, Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> drive me <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0095100801:173"/> into the Toils,
unleſs he meant to have me made a Prey of?</p>
            <p>I fairly confeſs this Action greatly ſunk him in my Eſteem;
nay, it even did the ſame in Mr. <hi>W—le</hi>'s, eſpecially as he
reaped no Satisfaction by it. I could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after regard Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> as a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; but rather as a Man whoſe Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I
was, and who would gladly diſpoſe of me to the beſt Bidder. Shocking
Thought!</p>
            <p>And yet this Scheme was ſo artfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, as indeed all his
againſt me have ever been, that I could not well reproach him for it; for he
would have alledged, it was a Party of Pleaſure intended by him for my Health
and Recreation; and to have mentioned Mr. <hi>W—le</hi>'s Attempt, why,
to ſay the Truth, I looked upon it as a Thing which any Man in the ſame
Circumſtances might naturally be guilty of, even tho' he had no previous
liking to, or Thought of the Woman. So, as there was no Harm done, I judged it
moſt prudent to be ſilent. Beſides, no Faults are ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily pardoned
by our Sex, as thoſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be occaſioned by our own Charms, 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0095100801:174"/> the eager Lover's conſtant Excuſe, and which our
Vanity is but too apt to admit as a reaſonable one.</p>
            <p>Of all Things in Nature, I moſt wonder why Men ſhould be
ſevere in their Cenſures on our Sex, for a Failure in Point of Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Is it not monſtrous, that our Seducers ſhould be our Accuſers? Will they
not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Fraud, nay, often Force to gain us? What various Arts, what
Stratagems, what Wiles will they uſe for our Deſtruction? but that once
accompliſhed, every oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious Term with which our Language ſo
plentifully abounds, ſhall be beſtowed on us, even by the very Villains who
have wronged us.

               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0095100801:175"/>Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s Year of
Chaplainſhip being near expired, I hoped that he would return to <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eland</hi>; but he had entertained a
Belief that Mr. <hi>Walpole</hi> would provide for him, and therefore
determined to ſtay in <hi>London,</hi> ſo I was forced to return ſingle;
for as Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s Income ceaſed with his Office, he choſe to
accept of an Offer from Mr. <hi>W—le</hi> to lodge in his Houſe. For
ſeveral Reaſons I thought it moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to reviſit my native Country;
the firſt and chief was the Affection I bore to my dear little ones; the
next, to avoid both the Temptation and Scandal I muſt have ſuffered, by
going into the Houſe of a Perſon, who, with regard to Women, had an
avowedly diſſolute Character.</p>
            <p>But however cautiouſly and prudently I acted in this Affair, it
was not my good Fortune to eſcape Calumny; ſo far from it, that I was both
traduced for going to <hi>London,</hi> and for returning from it; and the Wife
of a certain B—, who invited me to dine with her a Day or two after my
Return to <hi>Dublin,</hi> when we retired to our Tea, abuſed me in Language
I ſhould have <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0095100801:176"/> ſcorned, in reſpect to my own
Gentility, to have given to the meaneſt Servant I was ever Miſtreſs of:
And becauſe my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had made me a Preſent of a few little Trinkets,
all of which in the Expence amounted but to a Trifle, told me ſhe was ſure
ſome Gallant had given them to me. But, as I have ſince been informed,
ſhe was ragingly jealous of me, although without any Reaſon, I can the more
readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon her inhuman Treatment of me.</p>
            <p>But as I did not chuſe to bear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches I did not deſerve,
I ſent for a Chair, and, burſting into Tears, left the Room. In the Hall I
met the B—, who was coming to drink Tea with the Ladies: He was
ſurprized to ſee me ſo diſordered, and tenderly laying hold of me,
enquired the Cauſe. I deſired he would aſk his Lady, who had invited me,
to uſe me ill: Which he ſaid, he hoped ſhe would not do, even in Regard
to my Condition (being then pregnant). But, Heaven knows! had he but
conſidered how cruel all barren Creatures naturally are, inſomuch that I
have ſeen a barren Ewe <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0095100801:177"/> attempt to kill a young Lamb;
he would rationally have judged what might have, even in Law, been my
Protection, was the very Cauſe of her Hatred and Diſpleaſure to me.</p>
            <p>However, as this Lady was the firſt to attack my Character, I
can do no leſs than return her theſe my public and grateful
Acknowledgments; for though perhaps half the World cannot tell whom I mean; yet
as it is more than probable the Perſon concerned may read over theſe
Memoirs, ſhe at leaſt will know her own Portrait.</p>
            <p>'Tis really a ſad Misfortune, that the honeſt Liberty of the
Preſs is ſo ſuppreſſed in <hi>Ireland:</hi> But, however, I promiſe
all my Subſcribe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to oblige them
with a Key to whatever Secrets I have been obliged to lock up; and many I have
been obliged to ſtrike out of my Work, otherwiſe I could never have had a
ſingle Line printed.</p>
            <p>Vice in Power will command at leaſt an outward Homage; and
helpleſs Poverty dare not either oppoſe or expoſe it.</p>
            <p>A few Days after my Return to <hi>Ireland,</hi> Sir <hi>Daniel
Molineux</hi> ſaid in <hi>French</hi> to my <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0095100801:178"/> Brother in
St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Church, that he was ſurpriſed to ſee me look ſo
chearful, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my Huſband was in the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> My Bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her told it to me; but for my Life I
could not gueſs what the Gentleman meant.</p>
            <p>But too ſoon I was informed by the News-Papers, that Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> Mr. <hi>Motte,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gilliver,</hi> were all
taken up on account of ſome treaſonable Poetry, which Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> had given to the two latter to print; I then recollected the
Papers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, delivered to him by one of my Female
Fellow-Travellers.</p>
            <p>Who was the Informer I know not, both Parties having violently
accuſed each other; but in my Soul I believe Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> was
innocent, and I am ſure I have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be partial to him. But certain
it is, his Character ſuffered ſo much that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt broke my Heart, as
it deprived me of any Hopes even of his having Bread for his Family. The Notion
of his having betrayed Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> incenſed the whole Kingdom of
<hi>Ireland</hi> againſt him; and as I did not for many Weeks receive a
Letter from him, I knew not how to juſtify him; <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0095100801:179"/> and
when called upon by the late Primate (Dr. <hi>Hoadly</hi>) to give him an
Account of the Affair, I could only anſwer him with Tears, which, as both he
and his Lady were exceedingly humane, pleaded his Cauſe as powerfully as the
moſt moving Eloquence could have done; his Grace bade me be comforted, and
write to my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to come over and mind his Duty, and he would ſtill be
a Friend to him; and generouſly added, that as many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons buſied
themſelves in bringing Stories to him to Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s
Diſadvantage, I ſhould be welcome to his Table every Day, which would
diſcountenance thoſe who endeavoured to prejudice him, when they ſaw it
did not make him or his Spouſe withdraw their Regard from me.</p>
            <p>His Grace's Goodneſs affected me ſo much, that my Tears of
Sorrow were converted to thoſe of Gratitude; nor could I forbear falling on
my Knees to pay my Acknowledgments to him and his friendly Lady, for the Relief
their Kindneſs had given to a Heart overcome with Anguiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0095100801:180"/>At length I received a Letter from Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> which he was obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe to a Gentleman for me,
otherwiſe it would have been carried to the Caſtle, and there examined;
ſo great Notice was taken of theſe Poems. He wrote me word he had been ill
of the Rheumatiſm, and in great Trouble; that he would directly return to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> but that he had not Money to bear his Expences. I made an
Application to my Father for him, who bade me let the Fellow go to the
<hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and he would take care of me and the Children. But,
unfortunately for me, I had too much Good-nature to take this wholeſome
Advice; ſo far from it, that I never ceaſed importuning him, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him from Morning till Night, like <hi>Niobe</hi> all Tears, till he give me a
Bill of twenty Pounds to ſend to him, with which he came over to
<hi>Ireland</hi>; but ſo pale and dejected, that he looked like the Ghoſt
of his former ſelf; and the Diſregard he met with from every body went very
near his Heart. Every Day there was a new Abuſe publiſhed on him; my Father
battled for <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0095100801:181"/> him, and I did every thing in my power to
chear and comfort his Spirits. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion wrought now the ſame Effects
on me, as Love had done heretofore; and as he frequently wept, I could not
forbear mingling my Tears with his; and, by way of Conſolation, wrote to him
the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lines.

            </p>
            <p>I ſhould not have dwelt ſo long on every trivial
Circumſtance had I not been ſtrangely traduced about this Affair, which, as
I ſhall anſwer it to God, I have related with the utmoſt Truth and
Exactneſs. I never had any Breach with Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> till our final
Separation; and I am ſure if my Father had ſuſpected me of any
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, he would ſooner have joined with my Huſband to proſecute
me, than have <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0095100801:183"/> given him a ſingle Shilling to make up
Matters between us.</p>
            <p>Neither can I really imagine what I had done to merit all the
cruel and ſcandalous Aſperſions thrown on me, eſpecially by the Ladies:
It would be infinite Vanity to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Envy had any Share in their gentle
Breaſts; or that the Praiſes I received from the other Sex, on Account of
my Writings, awaked their Diſpleaſure againſt me: For though 
<q> 
                  <l>They had no Title to aſpire;</l> 
                  <l>Yet, when I ſunk, they roſe the high'r.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But what I think moſt ſurpriſing, is, that Women, who have
ſuffered in their own Reputations, are generally moſt cruel in their
Cenſures on others. I could men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Lady, who was ſo fond of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Colonel, that when he died, ſhe was almoſt mad, though he was a married
Man; and yet ſhe was heedful of the main Chance, in prevailing on him to
leave her his Eſtate from his Wife, whoſe Brother's Eſtate ſhe had
before ſecured to <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0095100801:184"/> herſelf, he being married to her.
I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this Lady the whole Town-talk of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and yet, by
having a large ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got Fortune, ſhe procured a ſecond Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, commenced
Prude, though not till Youth and Beauty were fled, and is, if ſhe yet lives,
one of the bittereſt Eenmies to any Woman, who has ever committed even an Act
of Indiſcretion, that can be found in the World, as I have proved many Years
ago by woful Experience. 
<q> 
                  <l>So <hi>Flavia,</hi> full of inward Guilt,</l> 
                  <l>Calls <hi>Florimel</hi> an arrant Jilt.</l>
               </q> But enough of
this. When Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> was once more ſettled in his Cure, I being
very much inclined to a Decay, my Father ſaid, nothing would more effectually
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore my Health than the Country; ſo having often been invited to his
Brother's at <hi>Cork,</hi> I reſolved on going there for a few Months, where
I was very kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. We took the Diverſions of the Seaſon at
<hi>Mallow,</hi> where nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happened to me, except that one 
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0095100801:185"/> Gentleman there took it into his Head to do, what they
there call black-guard me inceſſantly. It was the reigning Humour of the
Place, amongſt the young Folks, to call Names, ſell Bargains, and
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times talk indecently, all of which I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, and therefore this
Gentleman ſingled me out as a Mark for this Sort of Wit; and the more he
found it vexed me, the more he perſiſted in it. At laſt, I very
ſeriouſly demanded of him, what I had done to provoke him to teize me in
the manner he did? He ſaid, he heard I was a Wit; and wiſhed I would write
a Satire on him. So, to oblige him, I ſent him the following Lines, which
obtained me a Truce from his anti-ſublime Conceits.

            <p>And here, gentle Reader, I muſt bid you take leave of the Hope
of any farther chearful Amuſement; here commences the <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0095100801:188"/>
mournfulleſt Tale which ever yet was either told or read.</p>
            <p>The Winter's Return brought me to <hi>Dublin.</hi> My Huſband
met me about a Mile from Town, and took me and my Aunt <hi>Van Lewen</hi>'s
Siſter, who came to Town with me, out of the Stage-Coach into a Hackney one.
He entertained me with an Account of a violent Quarrel he had with my Father;
and ſaid, he hoped, if I had any Regard for him, I would never go with
inſide his Doors. This was a ſtrange Command, and as ſtrange did it
appear to me, that he ſhould quarrel with the beſt natured Gentleman in the
World; his Father in Effect, as he treated him as his Son! I told him, I hoped
he would excuſe my once diſobeying him; for I owed, if poſſible, a
ſuperior Duty to my Father, than a Huſband could claim. Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> was very angry. This was on <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night: The
next Morning, at all Hazards, I went to wait on my Father, who received me with
a Coldneſs, which ſtruck me to the Heart. I aſked him, if I had any way
offended him? He ſaid, <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0095100801:189"/> Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> had
uſed him ſo ill, he did not deſire to ſee his Wife. 
<q rend="inline">'Dear Sir (ſaid I) am I not your Daughter?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Yes, (ſaid he) and had you taken my Advice in
letting the Villain go to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> I ſhould have regarded
you as ſuch; but, make much of him; and remember, the Hour will come, when
you will wiſh you had followed your Father's Counſel.'</q> My Aunt's
Siſter was with me, to whom he never once ſpoke, but walked to and fro in a
ſort of a diſtracted Manner, and looked ſo ill, that, imagining my
Preſence diſturbed him, I aſked him where my Mother was? He ſaid, ſhe
was gone to take the Air; and that he had Company to dine with him, ſo that
he could not aſk me to ſtay. I took the Hint, and departed from him, in
ſuch inconceivable Sorrow, as I never in my Life experienced before,
becauſe I really loved him more than any thing in the World.</p>
            <p>I paſſed the Remainder of the Day in Tears, for my Huſband
never came home till Twelve o'Clock at Night; ſo that I <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0095100801:190"/> had full Liberty to indulge my Sorrow. I ſent my Compliments on
<hi>Friday</hi> and <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Morning to my Parents; they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they were very well; but they neither aſked me to come to them, nor came to
me.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> I was invited to Dinner to Mr.
<hi>Dubourg</hi>'s. I found myſelf ſo ill, that I could not go to Church;
however, about Two o'Clock, I went to dine with my Friends, who looked on me
with as much Surprize as if they had ſeen an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition. They had no
ſooner ſeated me, but they both went out of the Room, and held a long
Conſultation at the Door: Little did I think how deeply I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in
it. At length Mrs. <hi>Dubourg</hi> came in: I tenderly reproached her with her
Coldneſs to me: She ſaid, ſhe was not well; and aſked me, had I heard
from <hi>Moleſworth-ſtreet</hi> that Day? I told her, I had not. She
aſked me, if Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> would come to Dinner? I told her, he was
engaged to preach at <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s Church in the Afternoon, and
therefore went to Mrs. <hi>Warren</hi>'s, where they dined early. 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0095100801:191"/> A little while after, Counſellor <hi>Smith</hi> came
in; but they called him out, and held a long Conference with him. In ſhort,
every body behaved themſelves ſo oddly to me, that I knew not what to make
of it.</p>
            <p>Juſt as Dinner was ſerved up, Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> came in: 
<q rend="inline">'My Dear (ſaid I) you are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than
Promiſe.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why (ſays he) I am not come to dine, but to
tell you your Father is ſtabbed.'</q> Had he plunged a Dagger in my Heart, it
could not have given me a deeper Wound.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, this Accident, for ſuch my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared it to
be, happened at Nine o'Clock in the Morning; and ſo unkind were my Mother and
Siſter, they never ſent me the leaſt Notice of it. The Company I went to,
had known of it ſome Hours before; and conſequently were ſurprized to
find me ignorant of what ſo nearly concerned me, and what, by that Time, all
<hi>Dublin</hi> knew. None of them could find in their Hearts to tell me of it;
and this was the Occaſion of the many Conſultations they held, which had
appeared ſo ſtrange to me. It would be tedious to my Readers, to relate
every <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0095100801:192"/> Difficulty I had even to ſee my Father. In
reſpect to the Aſhes of my Mother, I do not chuſe to tell how ill I was
uſed upon this Occaſion; but as I owe no ſort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or Ceremony
to my Siſter, (if I may call her one, who by no means deſerves that Title)
I muſt proceed. I roſe from the Table, had a Chair called, and went to my
Father's: Three of the Servants ſat in the Hall, and my Siſter,
exceſſively dirty, walked to and fro in it. She would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have kept
me out; but however, the Servant knowing me, opened the Door. The firſt
Noiſe which ſtruck my Ear, upon my Entrance, was the deep and piercing
Groans of my dear Father. When I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to go up Stairs to offer my Duty to
him, my Siſter by Violence pulled me down; but the Agony I was in for my
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Reſentment I conceived at her groſs Uſage of me,
ſupplied me with Strength to get up in deſpight of her. When I opened the
Dining-room Door, the Floor was all beſmeared with Blood; my Mother, in an
arbitrary Voice, aſked me, what Buſineſs I had there? I told her, 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0095100801:193"/> I had a Child's Right to pay my Duty to my Father. She
ſaid, if I ſpoke to him it would kill him. Upon which, for the firſt, and
indeed the only Time that ever I gave her an impertinent Anſwer; I ſaid,
that if every Perſon about my Father had loved him with half my Tenderneſs,
he would not have been reduced to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I was then too ſure he was
in. Upon this, I offered to go into the Bed-chamber, but was not only forcibly
withſtood, but even beaten by my Mother, and again aſked, if I intended to
kill my Father? I made her no Reply but ſat down, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, that
the firſt Perſon who opened that Door I would go in. In about three Minutes
time Dr. <hi>Cope,</hi> Dr. <hi>Helſham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicholls,</hi> and in
all ſeven Phyſicians and three Surgeons (as my Father was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
eſteemed) came of their own Accord to viſit him; when I heard them on the
Stairs, I took that Opportunity to open the Bed-chamber Door, in which neither
my Mother nor my Siſter could well op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me, as the Gentlemen were come
into the Dining-room, before they were appriſed <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0095100801:194"/> of my
Intention; but, Heavens! how ſhall I deſcribe the Agony that ſeized me,
when I beheld my dear Father pale as Death, and unable to utter any thing but
Groans? thoſe only who have loved a Father as well as I did mine, can judge
of my Condition: I kneeled down by the Bedſide: Weak as he was he kindly
reached out his Hand to me: He aſbed me if this was not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Accident.
I begged he would not ſpeak, becauſe Mr. <hi>Nicholls</hi> had told me, his
Lungs were wounded, and that every Word was detrimental to him; but as I had
not ever knowingly offended him, I begged he would give me leave to pay my Duty
to him, and that he would ſignify it, by laying his Hand on my Head, which he
not only did, but deſired I would not leave him. But here my Father gave me
an impoſſible Taſk; for no ſooner were the Gentlemen departed, but my
Mother ſaid ſhe muſt ſpeak with me; and whether ſhe was really mad,
or counterfeited to be ſo, I know not; but ſhe inſiſted on my going to
Bed with her, alledging that my Siſter was younger and ſtronger than I, 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0095100801:195"/> and better able to bear the Fatigue of ſitting up.
This ſeemed to carry the Appearance of Love and Tenderneſs; but Heaven
knows it was far otherwiſe, as I afterwards found out; for the three
following Days my Mother never permitted me to leave her; if I ever attempted
it, ſhe tore her Hair, and ſcreamed like a Lunatick. The fourth Night I
heard my Father ring a Bell, my Mother was aſleep, and as my Thoughts were
ever on him, I ran down Stairs to him undreſt as I was. He ſeemed
ſurprized to ſee me, having been told that I was in my own Houſe, and
would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Trouble of attending him. I found him in a very cold
Sweat; it ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly came into my Head, that if I could change that into a hot
one, it might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, relieve him. So after aſſuring him, that I had not
quitted him, nor had ever been out of the Houſe, but was prevented by my
Mother and Siſter from attending on him, he ſaid he was very dry, and
aſked me, what the Phyſicians had ordered for him to drink. As they all
concluded he would not out-live that Night, they had ordered 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0095100801:196"/> nothing, but left him to take what he pleaſed, as, in
ſpight of all Precautions to the contrary, I had overheard. Upon this, I
reſolved ſo far to turn Phyſician myſelf as to tell him, they ordered
him to drink ſome Hock and Sack made warm. Weak as he was he could not
forbear ſmiling, and ſaying, he never heard of ſuch another
Preſcription; 
<q rend="inline">'Ten Gentlemen meet to order me ſome Hock and
Sack mixed! ſaid he; well, give it me: it muſt certainly be a Cure for a
pleuretick Fever.'</q> I did ſo; nay, I not only gave it to him that Time,
but plied him with it every Time he called for Drink all Night, till it
produced the Effect I deſired, and threw him into a fine breathing Sweat, and
a deep Sleep. It may now be demanded, where my Siſter was all this Time? why,
as ſhe had not, if I may ſpeak my Mind, half the Regard for my Father that
I had, ſhe was faſt aſleep in the Arm-Chair, nor could he awake her.</p>
            <p>When the Phyſicians came in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they were agreeably
ſurprized to find my Father's Fever quite gone, and his Eyes 
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0095100801:197"/> look very lively; he told them, their merry
Preſcription had done him gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rvice. I winked at them not to
undeceive him; they underſtood me, and Dr. <hi>Helſham</hi> called me
aſide, under Pretence of giving me ſome Directions, but in reality, to
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me what I had adminiſtered. I told him, and he could not forbear
ſmiling. He called the Gentlemen into the next Room to a Conſultation, to
which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after I was ſummoned. As both Dr. <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Cope</hi> were Men of Wit and Pleaſantry, they rallied me agreeably
on preſuming to practiſe Phyſick, having never taken my Degrees; and
aſſured me I ſhould be called before the College of Phyſicians, and be
proſecuted as an Empyrick.</p>
            <p>I roſe up, and making a low Courteſy, I told them, as the
beſt Part of the College of Phyſicians were then preſent, they would, I
hoped, have Candour enough to permit me to make my own Defence; to which they
all aſſented by a gracious Nod, and bade me proceed; I then, making another
Reverence, told them, that as to my Right of practiſing Phyſick, I held it
<hi>extra ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi> 
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0095100801:198"/> and ſmiling ſaid, I
ſuppoſed they all underſtood <hi>Latin</hi>—but as their proper
Buſineſs was to deſtroy Life, I hoped they would not take it amiſs, if
I for once, in a Caſe which ſo nearly and deeply concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, had, to the
utmoſt of my power, fruſtrated their Deſigns; neither had I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to interfere, till they themſelves had aſſured me all Hope of my Father's
Life was gone, and that he could not live till Morning. But, ſaid I, making
another Courteſy, I, with all reſpect to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Board, humbly
preſume to believe, 
<q> 
                  <l>They had rather chuſe that he ſhould die,</l> 
                  <l>Than their Prediction prove a Lye.</l>
               </q> Nothing, except my
Father's being ſo very weak, and ſo very near to us, could have prevented
the Gentlemen's laughing hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at my fine Harangue. However, I was
diſmiſſed with Honour; and as my Father ſeemed now to want nothing but
Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, I was directed to make him ſome Viper Broth, Hartſhorn
Jelly, Chocolate, and other nouriſhing Aliments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0095100801:199"/>From this Time we entertained Hopes of my
Father's Recovery. In a few Days he was ſo ſtrong as to be able to ſit up
from Morning till Night. The whole Town ſeemed to participate in our Joy; and
many who had never viſited him before, came now to congratulate him and his
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily on this happy Change. Whether it was owing to his having ſeen too
much Company, or to his own over-Neatneſs in inſiſting on having his
Chamber cleaned, I know not; but I received a Meſſage from Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> that he was taken very ill, and deſired to ſee me. As I
had flattered myſelf my Father was out of Danger, I obeyed the Commands of my
Huſband, and prevailed on Mr. <hi>Nicholls</hi> to come to viſit him. He
had got a Cold, and was a little feveriſh; Mr. <hi>Nicholls</hi> thought
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to take a little Blood from him, and I ſtaid with him that Night and
Part of the enſuing Day. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> being much relieved, gave me
leave in the Evening to go to my Father's, where I found all Things in
Confuſion, and he ſo ill that there was now not the leaſt Hope of his 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0095100801:200"/> Recovery: He coughed inceſſantly, was ſeized with
what they call a galloping Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and in a very few Days after
expired, leaving me in inconceivable Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. About an Hour before he departed,
I left the Room being unable to ſee his laſt Agonies, and went up to my
Mother, who was as faſt locked up in Sleep as guiltleſs Labour. Some time
after I heard the Windows thrown up, by which I knew his mortal Cares were
ended.</p>
            <p>We had that Evening engaged a Nurſe Keeper, but did not dare to
let her into my Father's Preſence, leſt he ſhould ſay, as he once did,
on propoſing ſuch a thing, that we were tired of him; but now her
Aſſiſtance was abſolutely neceſſary, tho' my Siſter told me,
ſhe herſelf helped to waſh and lay my Father out. I am ſure I could
have died ſooner; but ſome Perſons have uncommon Courage, or rather, as
<hi>Swift</hi> obſerves, 
<q> 
                  <l>Indiff'rence clad in Wiſdom's Guiſe,</l> 
                  <l>All Fortitude of Mind ſupplies.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0095100801:201"/>About three o'Clock in the Morning, on
New-Year's-Day, my Siſter came into the Room, and deſired me to come and
help her to take my Father up, that he wanted to riſe. Tho' I was certain he
was dead, as I had not taken off my Cloaths, I went with her, and ſent in the
Maid to ſit by my Mother. I aſked my Siſter on the Stairs, was my Father
alive? She anſwered, No. So with a heavy Heart I went into the Dining-Room;
but by no means could I ſummon up ſufficient Spirits, to look upon the
clay-cold Figure of him, who, under God, was the Author of my Being. My Heart
fluttered; my Tongue refuſed it's Office; neither had I the poor Relief of
Tears—no Wonder, when <hi>the very Spring and Fountain of my Life was
ſtopt—the very Source of it was ſtopped,</hi> if the Streams thereon
dependant, were for a while froze up and dead.</p>
            <p>While I was loſt in melancholy-muſing, my Siſter was very
induſtrious in making the Tea-Kettle boil. I do not ſay this by way of
Reflection on her; for tho' I was leſs aſſiduous about it, my own Mouth
was <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0095100801:202"/> perfectly parched with Thirſt, and I was very glad
of ſomething to moiſten it.</p>
            <p>When the Tea was ready, unluckily we had no Sugar, nor was there
any in the Houſe, but what was in the Tea-Cheſt, the Key of which was in my
Mother's Pocket under her Head. My Siſter went up and waked her, telling her,
my Father wanted a little burned Wine. She readily gave it, and prayed devoutly
that it might do him good. My Siſter came down laughing, to think how ſhe
had impoſed on her. If any thing could have added Weight to the intolerable
Burthen of my Sorrows, I now felt it, by conſidering how terrible my Mother's
Surprize and Diſappointment muſt be!</p>
            <p>About ſix o'Clock, I thought is was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſend the
Cheſt of Plate into Dean <hi>Madden</hi>'s, and to lock up whatever was
valuable; a prudent Precaution, as it too ſoon appeared. After this I went
into my Mother's Chamber; ſhe aſked me how my Father was. I told her he had
been very ill in the Beginning of the Night, but was now very quiet. She
ſaid, ſhe hoped Sleep <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0095100801:203"/> would do him good. I
anſwered, I truſted in God it had. So ſhe aroſe, and would not put on
her Shoes leſt ſhe ſhould diſturb him: Nay, ſo ſtrong was the Force
of her Imagination, that ſhe even ſaid, ſhe heard him cough as we
paſſed by his Chamber Door: But a ſad Counterfeit was I; for when we came
into his Dreſſing-Room, which opened to the Garden, as it was now
Day-light, my Mother eaſily perceived the Concern in my Countenance; ſhe
ſhrieked when ſhe looked at me, and with great Impatience aſked me, what
ailed me: 
<q rend="inline">'O Lord! cried ſhe, cannot you give me one Word
of Comfort?'</q> I anſwered very faintly, I wiſhed it was in my Power: But
alas! her worſt Fears were but too true; all was over. I really thought ſhe
would now have run quite mad; ſcarcely could I prevent her going into his
Chamber. I ſent in for Dean <hi>Madden,</hi> who by Prayers and ſpiritual
Advice, a little calmed her; but one Woe trod upon the other's Heels: Mr.
<hi>Nicholls,</hi> who for the particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he had for my Father, was his
firſt Viſitor, and whoſe Humanity during the <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0095100801:204"/> whole
Time of his Sickneſs, deſerves a grateful Acknowledgment; which, if the
ſurviving Part of his Family refuſe, I think it incumbent on me to pay,
ſo far at leaſt as Words can do it, came into the Dining-Room; he
gueſſed our Loſs 'ere we could ſpeak it, and ſeemed to bear a Part in
our Sorrows. He aſked me what Hour he ſhould come to open my Father. I told
him, he had left his Curſe on any Perſon who attempted it. He ſaid he was
very glad of it; for as this diſmal Operation muſt have fallen to his
Share, it would, I am certain, greatly have ſhocked his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. I would
have had him go up to ſee my Mother: He ſaid it would but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new her
Trouble, and that when ſhe was a little more calm he would make her a
Viſit.</p>
            <p>I now thought it highly neceſſary to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my poor
Mother to take, at leaſt, a Diſh of Tea, which I could not do, but by
aſſuring her I was ready to faint. Juſt as it was prepared, a Servant,
looking like a Ghoſt, opened the Door, and beckoned me to follow him; I did
ſo, and upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0095100801:205"/> down Stairs, found the Houſe
filled with Sheriff's Officers: One of them, whoſe Name was
<hi>Williams,</hi> was moſt remarkably inſolent, and abuſed me very
groſly. I once more ſent in for Dean <hi>Madden</hi>; I believe the worthy
Gentleman thought his Words might prevail, but the Scoundrel <hi>Williams</hi>
bade him, go talk in his Pulpit. However, I had Preſence of Mind
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to write a Line to Counſellor <hi>Smith</hi>; he happened not
to be at home; ſo I begged of the Dean to go to my Mother, leaſt thoſe
licenſed Robbers ſhould plunder the Houſe. About ſeven in the Evening
Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> came; he found the Wretches very buſy in taking an
Inventory of the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They were full as rude to him, as they had been to
the Dean; and at laſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it ſo far, as to inſiſt upon arreſting
my Father's Body, juſt then laid in a Coffin. I, almoſt wild with Grief,
ran after them; the Coffin was open, and I raiſed my dear Father in my Arms,
and, as if he could have heard me, aſked him, Would he not protect his
Family? Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had, in the mean Time, ſent for the High-Sheriff;
he <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0095100801:206"/> was a young, good-natured Gentleman; and, after
heartily reprimanding the Fellows, nay, and even making <hi>Williams</hi> beg
pardon on his Knees, diſmiſſed them all, except one, whom he ordered, not
only to be civil, but alſo to do the Work of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; aſſuring us, he
would take an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of the Things himſelf, as ſoon as the Funeral was
over.</p>
            <p>The next Day, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to have my
dear Father buried, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Directions, privately, at Twelve
o'Clock at Night; and I eaſily prevailed on Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and his
preſent Lady, to give their Company to my Mother, during the Time of this
laſt ſad ſolemn Ceremony. As my Mother wept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, it made her
ſleepy; but the Noiſe made in carrying down my Father's Corpſe, awak'd
her; and as ſhe had only ſlumber'd in her Chair, ſhe ſtarted up, crying
out, they were carrying her dear Huſband to the Grave, and that ſhe would
go and be buried with him. We were obliged by Violence to reſtrain her; nay,
and alſo to aſſure her he had been interred <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0095100801:207"/> ſome
Hours, and that the Noiſe ſhe heard was only that of the Servants, who were
ſetting Things in Order. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and his Lady, who, according to
their Promiſe, came and paſſed the Evening with my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid every
thing that Reaſon, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, or Humanity could dictate, to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
her Afflictions. Gratitude for their Kindneſs made her endeavour to
ſupreſs the Anguiſh of her Soul; nay, out of Complaiſance to them,
ſhe drank a Glaſs or two of Wine, which, as ſhe had not done for ſome
Weeks before, produced the Effect I deſired, of making her ſleep. Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> attended the Funeral Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, which was the only Proof
of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or Kindneſs he ever ſhewed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>Early the next Morning, I roſe; and if, in the melancholy
Situation of my Soul, any thing could have made me ſmile, the Cookmaid's
Simplicity would certainly have done it; for, finding her Fire made, her
Diſhes waſhed, and every thing ſet in good Order, ſo well did the
Bailiff, who was left in the Houſe, obey the High Sheriff's 
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0095100801:208"/> Orders, in doing the Work of a Servant; and he having
walked into the Garden; the Maid not recollecting there was any ſuch Perſon
in the Houſe, ſtood croſſing herſelf, and praying to the Bleſſed
Virgin, and all the Saints in Heaven. I aſked her, What was the matter? 
<q rend="inline">'O my dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam! (ſays ſhe) my Maſter was
always neat; and ſee, for all he is dead, how he made the Fire, and cleaned
up the Kitchen for me.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I left the poor Girl in her Miſtake, and went up to my Mother.
It grieved me to awake her; yet knowing the High Sheriff would be early with
us, and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of what was in her Chamber muſt be taken, I
thought it was moſt decent for her to be up, as her unhappy Situation could
not authorize her taking on the State of a Lady of Quality, to lie in Bed a
Month for Faſhion's-ſake.</p>
            <p>She was not long up before the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came: From him I
learned, that this Execution was laid at the Suit of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow <hi>Ford,</hi>
who being Executrix to her Children, had aſked my Father, where ſhe 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0095100801:209"/> could lay out their Money to Advantage. As Mr.
<hi>Monck</hi> wanted Money, my Father immediately thought of him; but as his
Eſtate was not liable to his Debts, my Father became Surety for him. This was
enough for me; I immediately wrote to Mr. <hi>Monck</hi>; who, on Receipt of
the Letter, came to Town, and, with great Honour, not only diſcharged his own
Debt, but alſo paid the Sheriff's Fees, which in three Days amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
Twenty Pounds.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman was the late <hi>Henry Stanly Monck,</hi> of
<hi>St. Stephen's Green.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Siſter, like all provident Perſons, made the beſt of her
Way to her Huſband's Mother; who being aſſured, by Dean <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
that he himſelf had married my Siſter to her Son, which had been
queſtioned, on Account of his abrupt Departure from her, ſoon after he had
made her a Mother, was ſo kindly received by her new Parent, that for three
Weeks after, ſhe never either ſent, or came, to know what was become of the
old one.</p>
            <p>As my Father had poſitively prohibited us from writing any
Account to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0095100801:210"/> then at <hi>Paris,</hi> of the
Misfortune that had befallen him, I thought it not proper to diſobey him;
yet, at the ſame time, judged it highly neceſſary he ſhould be
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of the melancholy Situation of his Affairs at home; I therefore
engaged a young Gentleman, an intimate Friend of my Brother's, to undertake the
mournful Taſk, and adviſe him immediately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Ireland:</hi>
But his beſt Speed could not overtake his Father's Life, who had been three
Weeks buried e're he arrived. When he ſaw us in deep Mourning, and miſſed
the dear Parent, who uſed ever to receive him with the Love of a Father, and
the Freedom of a Companion, all his Reſolution could ſcarce ſupport it:
and tho' he endeavoured to comfort us, 'twas but too viſible he wanted it
himſelf. My Heart bled for him; ſo diſappointed in all his Hopes, which,
as they had been high raiſed, were now the more depreſſed. In ſhort, we
were all mere Outſide, each endeavouring, by a forced Chearfulneſs, to
conceal their inward Anguiſh from each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0095100801:211"/>As my Brother, ſoon after, ſold off the
Goods by Auction, and placed my Mother, who was left entirely dependant on him,
to board at a Clergyman's Houſe in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, after which I never ſaw
her more; I returned to my own Houſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> having now no Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Fortune by
me, he threw off all Diſguiſe, and ſhewed himſelf in his proper
Colours; he had, it ſeems, while I was in the Country, in a bad State of
Health, got in League with the Widow <hi>W—rr—n,</hi> whom he
intended, if I had died, as was expected, ſhould ſupply my Place. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he was reſolved to gid rid of me at any rate; and as nothing but my Death, or
a Divorce, could accompliſh his Deſires, the latter ſeemed the ſafer
Method. To this End, he ſet all his Engines to work. His firſt Scheme I
ſhall here relate.</p>
            <p>One Morning pretty early, he ſent for me to come to him to
Breakfaſt in the Summer-houſe; as I thought he was alone, I ran to him
quite undreſt; but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the Sight of a Gentleman, whom I had
never ſeen before, and who was dreſt <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0095100801:212"/> out with the
utmoſt Magnificence and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, rather in the Habit of a Birth-Night
Beau, than a Morning Viſitor. I was for retiring, but Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>
obliged me to come in, and introduced him to me. I ſat down with the beſt
Grace I could; and made the Tea: Before it was half over Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>
ſaid, he was obliged to go viſit a ſick Perſon; but that he ſhould
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in half an Hour, engaging me not to let the Gentleman go till then; at
the ſame time aſſuring him, I was very well qualified to entertain him
agreeably. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did not expreſs the leaſt Reluctance at complying
with his Requeſt; ſo far from it, that as ſoon as he was gone, he ſaid,
he was much indebted to Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s Complaiſance, for the
favourable Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he had afforded him of ſpeaking his Wiſhes; and,
laying hold of my Hand, he began to addreſs me in a moſt bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtic
Stile, with Fuſtian from exploded Plays. For my part, I thought he was mad,
and growing angry at what I deemed a great Incivility to a married Woman, I
aſſured him, if he perſiſted in ſuch Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0095100801:213"/> I would quit the Place. He then begged Pardon moſt
humbly indeed, for he threw himſelf on the Carpet at my Feet, ſwearing he
would never riſe till I had forgiven him; which, not to be plagued with his
farther Impertinence, I was forced to ſay, I did. He then wanted me to
confirm it by a Kiſs, but that I would by no means grant. In ſhort, his
Company was ſo tireſome, that I moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently longed for a Releaſe;
which, however, Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> was reſolved not to give me: So
finding the Gentleman was determined to proſecute me, I told him I was
engaged to dine abroad, and hoped he would excuſe my leaving him, as I
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a Lady to call upon me, which laid me under a Neceſſity of going
to dreſs.</p>
            <p>Upon this civil Diſmiſs, to my great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he took his
Leave, promiſing me, he would do himſelf the Honour of waiting on me again
very ſpeedily, to which I made no Reply.</p>
            <p>I believe he went to Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> to give him an Account
of what had paſt, <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0095100801:214"/> who ſome time after returned, and
ſeemed much offended, that I had ſuffered his Friend, as he called him, to
go away; add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he was related to the Duke of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and
might, by his Intereſt, get him a good Living. I anſwered, Let him be ever
ſo well related, he was a very troubleſome Coxcomb, and if he liked ſuch
Company, I did not.</p>
            <p>A few Days after my youngeſt Child died, and that I might avoid
ſeeing the Funeral, I retired to the Summer-Houſe, where I ſat weeping;
when ſuddently this ſame fine Spark opened the Door. He told me, Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> had ſent him to deſire I would have ſome Coffee ready,
and that he would be at home immediately. I deſired the Gentleman to go with
me to the Dwelling-Houſe, not chuſing to ſtay alone with him at ſo
great a Diſtance from every Body. The Coffee was prepared, but no Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> came, ſo we drank it without him, and the Gentleman fell
into his old Vagaries again. I then, 
<q>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0095100801:215"/> 
                  <l>All ſmarting with my Griefs, being vex'd</l> 
                  <l>To be ſo peſtered by a Popinjay,</l> 
                  <bibl>Shakeſpear.</bibl>
               </q> Burſt into Tears, and demanded
of him, what he meant by ſuch Inſolence? He looked v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y much confounded, and aſked me, was I in earneſt? I
aſſured him I was, and that I would acquaint Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> with
his Rudeneſs. He ſmiled at that Threat, and to my great Surprize, made me
the following Speech. 
<q rend="inline">'Madam, I am convinced by your Behaviour, that you
are a Woman of Honour, and am very ſorry I ſhould be ſo unfortunate as to
provoke your Tears: The beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence I can make you, is, to entruſt you
with a Secret; and I doubt not but you will have Diſcretion enough to make a
proper uſe of it. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed you to me, as a Lady
very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral of your Favours, and begged I would be ſo kind as to make him a
Cuckold, ſo that he might be able to prove it, in order to a Separation from 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0095100801:216"/> you; promiſing to give me Time and Opportunity for it:
He aſſured me, it would be no difficult Taſk; that I need but throw
myſelf at your Feet, whine out ſome Tragedy, and you would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield.
But I am now convinced, that he is a very great V—n, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of you.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I leave my Reaſon to judge of my Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. I could
ſcarce give the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Credit; and yet it was but too evident that he
ſpoke Truth, as it was now nine o'Clock at Night, and Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>
not come home to his invited Gueſt.</p>
            <p>When I had recovered Power to ſpeak, I told him, I ſuppoſed
Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> knew him to be a Perſon deſtitute of all Honour and
Humanity, when he propoſed ſuch a Scheme to him as that of betraying any
Woman. 
<q rend="inline">'Faith, Madam, returned he, I never intended it;
for had you made me happy, I would, like a Gentleman, have forſworn it, and
alſo have given you a proper Caution: But I would not pay you ſo ill a
Compliment, as not to aſſure you, the Bait was very illuring. 
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0095100801:217"/> I believe there are very few young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows who would
have refuſed him the Favour he deſired of me.'</q> I then beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged he would
be ſo kind to leave me, which, accordingly, taking his Leave very
reſpectfully, he did.</p>
            <p>I went to Bed full of Diſquietude; but the bitter Anguiſh of
my Soul quite baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sleep. I conſidered the Snares were laid for me,
and that he who ought to be the Guardian and Protector of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, was
the very firſt Perſon who ſought to deſtroy it. I wept abundantly, and
prayed heartily to God, to deliver me out of my Trouble; at length I fell into
a Slumber, when methought my Father, juſt as I had ſeen him in his Coffin,
drew open the Curtain, and muttered ſomething to me very low and
indiſtinct; but the Words <hi>Trouble, Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> I very
plainly heard. I ſtarted up, and turned the Head Curtain back; but ſeeing
nothing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Trouble of my Mind produced ſuch terrifying Dreams,
and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf to Heaven, once more addreſſed myſelf to
Sleep; when ſuddenly, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0095100801:218"/> I was in the midſt
of a Parcel of Ruffians who were fighting, and that I, though I knew not why,
was the Occaſion of their Quarrel. At laſt I thought one of them gave me a
ſevere Blow over the Head, at which I ſcreamed out, and Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> who was now in the Chamber, waked me, and aſked me, what
was the matter? I told him, I had a very ſhocking Dream. 
<q rend="inline">'Why, ſays he, you grieve ſo much after your
Father, and your Brat, and take no Suſtenance, that it is no Wonder you
ſhould be in the Vapours.'</q> I deſired he would be ſo kind as give me a
little Water; for I was in a faint cold Sweat; but as he always kept ſome
Cherry-Brandy in his Study, he made me take a little of it, which greatly
revived me. I then told him Mr. <hi>H—d</hi> had been to ſee him. He
aſked me, how long he ſtayed? I anſwered, till I was weary of him. 
<q rend="inline">'Why, did he offend you?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Indeed (returned I) he did.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'How?'</q> ſaid he. 
<q rend="inline">'By a great deal of Impertinence, not worth
relating. I ſuppoſe (ſaid he) the Coxcomb was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating 
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0095100801:219"/> his Poetry to you.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'No (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned I) he ſpoke nothing of his own;
he had a proper Authority, I believe, for whatever he ſaid.'</q> I looked
earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s Face, and could eaſily perceive he
was in great Confuſion; ſo he put out the Candle, and came to Bed without
aſking me any farther Queſtions.</p>
            <p>Early the next Morning he went out of Town, without either leaving
a Shilling to provide for his Family, which conſiſted of a Maid, a Footman,
two Children, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any Perſon to ſerve his Cure; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did
I, for the Space of two Months, hear from him, or receive any Supply; till at
laſt, by Accident, I learned he was with the Widow
<hi>W—rr—n.</hi> For the Truth of this, the Reverend Dr.
<hi>Bradford</hi> can bear Witneſs; I mean, ſo far as his going away
without either aſking his Permiſſion, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting any Perſon

            <p>In the mean time the Pariſh was quite in an Uproar; nobody to
viſit the Sick, or read Six o'Clock Prayers. I related this Part of my
Diſtreſs to my Brother, who prevailed on a young Gentleman, who had been
his School-fellow and Companion, then newly ordained, to do Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi>'s Duty.</p>
            <p>As for my two Children, I ſent them to School, and they dined
every Day with Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s Father; the Servants were forced to run
in Debt for Proviſion; and, for my own part, I quartered myſelf on my next
Door Neighbours, Mr. <hi>Lindſay</hi> and his Spouſe, where I always met a
chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and friendly Reception.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0095100801:221"/>I muſt here obſerve, that becauſe I
loved reading, Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> took with him the Key of his Study, into
which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all my Books, Preſents to me from my Friends before I
was married. He alſo locked up the Garden, rather chuſing it ſhould be
overgrown with Weeds, and the Plants and Flowers die for Want of Water, than
that either I or the Children ſhould have the Pleaſure of amuſing
our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it. The Tea-cheſt was alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; ſo I was left like
a tame Cat, with the Liberty of walking about through two or three empty
Rooms.</p>
            <p>When I had learned where Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> was, I wrote to
him; but received no Anſwer. At length, one <hi>Saturday,</hi> about Twelve
o'Clock at Noon, his Horſe was brought home and a mangy Dog, of which I was
ordered to take a particular care, which I did; and now expected the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But as his buxom old Widow (and old enough ſhe was to be my Mother, and big
enough to make four of me) came to Town with him, he ſtayed with her till
Twelve o'Clock at Night. His firſt Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0095100801:222"/> when he
entered was, where was his Dog? with which having played about half an Hour,
hugging, kiſſing, and calling it an Angel, he at laſt vouchſafed to
come up Stairs. I ſat in my Cloſet in a very penſive Poſture; his
firſt Salutation to me was, to aſk me, how I had the Impudence to write to
him about my Family Affairs? I aſked him to whom elſe ſhould I write? 
<q rend="inline">'Very fine! (returned he) ſuppoſe Mrs.
<hi>W—rr—n</hi> had opened my Letter!'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'I could not ſuppoſe that, Sir, becauſe it

               <q rend="inline">'You took with me! why ſhould you?</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Nay then (ſaid I) why ſhould ſhe?</q>

            <p>I believe he thought he had now gone too far, and was more than
half afraid I would publiſh all his Villanies; ſo he fell into his old
Trade of Diſſimulation, in which he is a perfect Maſter; and taking me by
the Hand, told me, he did not <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0095100801:223"/> think ſo gentle a Temper
as mine could be diſturbed at any Thing; and that it was very unkind in me to
be diſobliged at his taking a little Recreation in the Country; adding, that
he often wiſhed for me there. I aſked him why he did not take me with him?
He ſaid, he had propoſed it to Mrs. <hi>W—rr—n</hi>; but that
ſhe had objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, telling him, I was a Woman of ſo bad a
Reputation, that ſhe would not for all the World countenance me. I muſt beg

            <p>But to return: I told Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi> I was extremely
obliged to the Lady; that moſt Men, even if they hated their Wives, 
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0095100801:224"/> would reſent any Injury offered to them as being Part
of themſelves; but he was too good a Chriſtian for that. So I aroſe, and
was for leaving the Room. He aſked me, where I was going? I anſwered, 
<q rend="inline">'To ſleep with my Children; for why ſhould I,
Sir, go to bed to a Man, in whoſe Perſon, Mind, or Fortune, I have no
longer a Share; and who has actually divorced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from me, as the Law
can do!'</q>
            </p>
            <p>However he inſiſted on my ſtaying with him, which
accordingly I did. We both roſe pretty early; and the Children coming in to
aſk his Bleſſing, he whipt his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeverely, becauſe, as he
ſaid, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled my Mother; though indeed ſhe was infinitely more
like his own: And, to ſhew his Impartiality, he whipt the poor little Boy,
for being like himſelf.</p>
            <p>When this Scene was over, the Children were turned down to the
Kitchen, and the mangy Dog, which it ſeems was given him by Mrs.
<hi>W—rr—n,</hi> invited to a good Plate of Toaſt and Butter and
half a Pint of Cream for his Breakfaſt; ſo well did he 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0095100801:225"/> fulfil the old Proverb, <hi>Love me, love my
Dog.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After theſe Holy Exerciſes, he went to the Communion; which
indeed I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do, but as he had really vexed me paſt my Patience,
I could not compoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficiently for the worthily receiving
thoſe ſublime Myſteries.</p>
            <p>Thus we may ſee it is in the power of a bad Man, not only to
deſtroy our temporal, but alſo our eternal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>I ſaw no more of him till Midnight; buxom <hi>Joan</hi> engaging
him till then, or in other Words, the Widow <hi>W—rr—n.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s Father hearing he was in Town, came the
next Morning to ſee him, and demanded of him the Money he had paid for his
Childrens Tuition; upon which he turned to me, with an Air of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and told me, he thought when he had married ſo accompliſhed a Lady, ſhe
might have taught her Children to read, write, work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at
leaſt have ſaved him the Expence of their Education. I told him, and indeed
it was Truth, that I ſhould never deſire a more delightful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment 
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0095100801:226"/> than that of cultivating their Minds; but that he ought
to conſider, he left no Support for our Bodies, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I was
obliged to go abroad every Day to ſeek for Food, and could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber
ſuch Company, as I might be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to, with my Children. Here Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi>'s Father interrupted me, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I might always have
been welcome to him. Indeed I doubt it not, for he was a good-natured Man; but
as he kept an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, it was no very agreeable Place for me to paſs my
Time in.</p>
            <p>Next Morning buxom <hi>Joan</hi> came in her own Coach for her
Chaplain; a Right which moſt Widows of Fortune claim. I looked at her, and
ſhe hid her Face. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> ſoon waited on her, and away they
went together, leaving me juſt as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate as I was before.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> has often alledged, in order to prove me an
Adultreſs, as I was with Child when we parted, that he had no manner of
matrimonial Commerce with me for four Years. I was but juſt four and twenty
Years of Age when we were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0095100801:227"/> and, as my
Reader may obſerve, he would not permit me to have a ſeparate Bed, whether
what he not only ſaid, but ſwore, was true or falſe, I do not ſee how
he could gain any Honour by it.</p>
            <p>For as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Friar ſays, when old
<hi>Gomez</hi> boaſts that his Wife was a ſpotleſs Virgin for him; 
<q> 
                  <l>A fine Commendation truly!</l> 
                  <l>The Church did not put you together for that.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And here, gentle Reader, give me leave to drop the Curtain. To
avouch mine own Innocence in a Point, where Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances were ſtrong
againſt me, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps little avail me: The ſupreme Judge of Hearts
alone will at the laſt great Day clear or condemn me; to whoſe unerring
Juſtice and boundleſs Goodneſs I ſubmit my Cauſe.</p>
            <p>When Snares and Limed-Twigs are ſpread for a poor Bird, it
cannot well eſcape. Yet I may ſay with the condemned Duke of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0095100801:228"/> 
                  <l>We both fell by our Servants;</l> 
                  <l>Therefore, this receive as certain:</l> 
                  <l>Where you are lib'ral of your Loves and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</l> 
                  <l>Be ſure you are not looſe; for thoſe you make
Friends,</l> 
                  <l>And give your Hearts to, when they perceive</l> 
                  <l>The leaſt Rub in your Fortune, fall away</l> 
                  <l>Like Water from ye, never found again,</l> 
                  <l>But where they mean to ſink ye</l>
               </q> A proper Caution to
both Sexes, to be duly on their Guard againſt Confidants.</p>
            <p>I could reckon up numberleſs Inſtances of Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi>'s Averſion to me; one in particular I cannot paſs over.
One Day, at Dinner, the Pin in the Robing of my Gown, pricked my Breaſt; as
there was no body but my Huſband and Children preſent, I made no Scruple of
uncovering my Boſom, to examine what had hurt me; upon which Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> roſe from Table, and ſaid I had turned his Stomach. As I
really had a fine Skin, and was then a moſt remarkably neat Perſon, I
thought he only <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0095100801:229"/> jeſted; and merrily told him, he
ſhould kiſs my Breaſt and make it well: But alas! it was not like
<hi>Prior</hi>'s <hi>Lover's Anger,</hi> where when the Lady complains, that 
<q> 
                  <l>An ugly hard Roſe-bud has fall'n in my Neck,</l> 
                  <l>It has vex'd me, and plagu'd me to ſuch a Degree!</l> 
                  <l>Look here now; you'll never believe one, pray ſee,</l> 
                  <l>I' th' Left Side of my Breaſt what a Mark it has made!</l> 
                  <l>So ſaying, her Boſom ſhe careleſs diſplay'd:</l> 
                  <l>That Seat of Delight I with Wonder ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd,</l> 
                  <l>And forgot ev'ry Word I deſign'd to have ſaid.</l>
               </q> For
he told me, he was ſure he ſhould faint if I came near him; and either
pretended to throw up his Dinner, or did it in reality. After which polite
Compliment, he drank a large Glaſs of Cherry-brandy, to ſettle his Stomach;
and repaired to his uſual Haunt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to buxom <hi>Joan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0095100801:230"/>About Twelve at Night, he returned, and
awaked me out of a ſweet Sleep, by telling me, I was a moſt expenſive
extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Woman. I aſked him in what? He ſaid, in putting on clean Linen
every Day; whereas Mrs. <hi>W—rr—n,</hi> who had a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds a Year, aſſured him, ſhe never ſhifted herſelf but once a
Week, and ſhewed him Half-ſleeves, which ſhe wore, to ſave the Expence
of waſhing. I anſwered him very careleſly, that I ſuppoſed that was
what charmed him; and therefore, Dirt to Dirt.</p>
            <p>I beg leave here to remark, that my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Complaints were
very different from thoſe of moſt married Men; their general Excuſe for
going aſtray is, that their Wives are dirty, ſlothful, ignorant,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the very Reverſe of which ſwiniſh Qualities made my good
Man hate me. 
<q> 
                  <l>Well, grant me guilty, which never yet was proved;</l> 
                  <l>Yet I do think, if Wives do fall, it is their Huſbands
Fault.</l> 
                  <l>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0095100801:231"/>Say, that they ſlack their Duty, and
pour our Treaſure into foreign Laps,</l> 
                  <l>Or elſe break out in peeviſh Jealouſy,</l> 
                  <l>Throwing Reſtraint on us: Or ſay, they ſtrike us;</l> 
                  <l>Or ſcant our former Having, in Deſpight.</l> 
                  <l>Why, we have Galls; and though we have ſome Grace,</l> 
                  <l>Yet we have ſome Revenge. Let Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands know,</l> 
                  <l>Their Wives have Senſe like them: They ſee and
ſmell,</l> 
                  <l>And have their Palates both for ſweet and ſour,</l> 
                  <l>As Huſbands have. What is it that they do,</l> 
                  <l>When they change us for others? Is it Sport?</l> 
                  <l>I think it is. And doth Affection breed it?</l> 
                  <l>I think it doth. Is't Frailty that thus errs?</l> 
                  <l>It is ſo too. And have not we Affections?</l> 
                  <l>Deſire for Sport? and Frailty, as Men have?</l> 
                  <l>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0095100801:232"/>Then let them uſe us well; or let them
know,</l> 
                  <l>The Ills we do, their Ills inſtruct us to.</l> 
                  <bibl>Shakeſpear.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in one of the Sermons on Social Duties, publiſhed lately by
a real Divine, he makes this Obſervation, That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, very few Women
have either been ſo weak, or ſo wicked, to wrong the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-bed, but
when they have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to it, either by the ill Treatment they received
from their Huſbands, or in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to their prior Falſhoods.</p>
            <p>If I have not delivered the moſt worthy Author's Sentiments with
his own Elegance of Style, I am ſure he will pardon me, as I only quote from
Memory, not being Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of his admirable Works.</p>
            <p>I do aſſure my Reader, I do not, by thoſe Quotations, mean
to countenance Vice,

               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0095100801:233"/> So far from it,
that in my Opinion, Nothing can excuſe the Breach of it; and a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male 
<q> 
                  <l>Should ſtrip herſelf to Death, as to a Bed,</l> 
                  <l>Which, longing, ſhe'd been ſick for,</l> 
                  <l>Rather than yield her Body up to Shame.</l>
               </q> All I intend
is this; the World has been pleaſed to ſay, I had a moſt excellent
Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and therefore have thought proper, not thinking their Bill of
Accuſation large enough, to add <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to every other Vice and
Folly they are pleaſed to attribute to me.</p>
            <p>But ſo many Yards of Prunella and a Bit of clear Cambrick,

And ſo if my <hi>Quondam</hi> Huſband arrives at Fame, or ever goes to

reaſonable Man deſire more from his Wife? But ſome Folks are never to be

be a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: I hope ſome curious Commentator will hereafter endeavour to

            <p>I muſt beg my Reader's Pardon for theſe numerous Quotations;
but, as <hi>Swift</hi> ſays, 
<q rend="inline">'thoſe anticipating Raſcals the Ancients, have
left nothing for us poor Moderns to ſay:'</q> But ſtill to ſhew my
Vanity, let it ſtand as ſome ſort of Praiſe, that I have ſtolen
wiſely.</p>
            <p>At length the fatal Hour arrived, when Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s
Machinations wrought the Effect he ſo long deſired, namely, my
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0095100801:237"/> and, as he never did Things by Halves,
that of his own Children alſo; to whom his Barbarity has exceeded any thing I
ever either heard or read of; but that in due Place.</p>
            <p>I own myſelf very indiſcreet in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any Man to be at
an unſeaſonable Hour in my Bed-Chamber; but Lovers of Learning will, I am
ſure, pardon me, as I ſolemnly declare, it was the attractive Charms of a
new Book, which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would not lend me, but conſented to ſtay
till I read it through, that was the ſole Motive of my detaining him. But the
Servants, being bribed by their Maſter, let in twelve Watchmen at the Kitchen
Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, who, though they might have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Chamber-Door, choſe rather
to break it to pieces, and took the Gentleman and myſelf Priſoners.</p>
            <p>For my own Part, I thought they had been Houſe-breakers, and
would willingly have compounded for Life, when entered Mr. <hi>P—n,</hi>
with a Cambric Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief tied about his Neck, after the Faſhion of Mr.
<hi>Fribble,</hi> and with the <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0095100801:238"/> Temper of a Stoic, bid
the authorized Ruffians not hurt me: But his Chriſtian Care came too late;
for one of them had given me a violent Blow on the Temple, and another had
dragged two of my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers out of Joint. The Gentleman, at the Sight of Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> threw down his Sword, which he obſerving, made two of the
Watchmen hold him, while he moſt courageouſly broke his Head.</p>
            <p>After this heroic Action, he told me, who ſtood quite
ſtupified between Surprize and Pain, that I muſt turn out of Doors; but
obſerving that I was fainting, he brought up a Bottle of Wine, and kindly
drank both our Healths. He would fain have prevailed on us to pledge him; but
we were not in a Temper to return Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Upon which he took my Hand, and
very generouſly made a Preſent of me to the Gentleman, who could not in
Honour refuſe to take me, eſpecially as his own Liberty was not to be
procured on any other Terms. Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> kindly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed our
Guards, and aſſured us, as ſoon as ever he had obtained a Divorce, he 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0095100801:239"/> would with great Pleaſure, join us together in holy
Matrimony. At the Door the Gentleman's Sword was delivered to him. Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> offered to kiſs me at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which mean Piece of
Diſſimulation, ſo much in the Stile of <hi>Jack Ketch,</hi> gave me the
utmoſt Contempt for the V—n.</p>
            <p>It was by this time two o'Clock in the Morning, and we knew not
where to ſteer our Courſe: However, the Gentleman's Servant always ſat up
for him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he judged it more adviſeable to go to his own
Lodging, than to ſearch for any other, and, truly, I little cared where I
went.</p>
            <p>And here, I ſincerely aſſure my Reader, that neither of us
even entertained a Thought of any thing like Love, but ſat like Statues till
Day-break; when recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had nothing to change me with, I wrote a
Letter to Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> to deſire he would ſend me my wearing
Apparel, or at leaſt ſome clean Linen.</p>
            <p>He complied with my Requeſt, and wrote me a long Letter, wherein
he ſeemingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed an infinite Concern for my Loſs, but 
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0095100801:240"/> as I had moſt ſtrenuouſly recommended our Children
to his Care, he gave it then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand that he was perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
they were his own, and that I might depend on his Tenderneſs to them; but at
the ſame time, as he was determined to be legally divorced, he expected I
would not give him any Oppoſition in it.</p>
            <p>Before I received this Letter, I had taken a Lodging in
<hi>Abbey-ſtreet</hi> up two pair of Stairs, where my Clothes were brought to
me, together with it; but not a ſingle Shilling to aſſiſt me, my Watch,
my Books, and even what few Jewels I poſſeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Marriage, were
detained from me, which threw me quite dependant on the Courteſy of the
Perſon I was accuſed with.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> was ſo highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at our not
cohabiting together, as he wiſhed, that he forced the Gentleman to fly, who
having Notice that there was an Action taken out againſt him, made the beſt
of his way to <hi>London,</hi> leaving a Letter with five Guineas encloſed in
it for <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0095100801:241"/> me, in the Hands of a Diſſenting Miniſter,
who very faithfully diſcharged his Truſt.</p>
            <p>Curioſity made me go to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Lodging to enquire of
his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady what ſhe knew relating to him; the Gentlewoman was very
obliging, but could give me no Satisfaction or Light into the Affair: However,
ſhe made me drink Tea with her, and we ſat together till near nine o'Clock
at Night.</p>
            <p>At my return to my own Lodging, the Maid told me my Room was Let;
I ſaid that was odd, as it was taken by the Week, and one not then expired,
to Let it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving me Warning to provide myſelf, which, at that Hour,
in a Winter's Night, it was impoſſible for me to do.</p>
            <p>The Maid, to whoſe care this Houſe was entruſted, for I know
not who was Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, told me, I might if I pleaſed lie in the firſt
Floor, as the Family were not come to Town, and there were only their Servants
in the Houſe, whom ſhe could diſpoſe of into worſe Beds; but, to my
great Surprize, I found the Lock had been taken off the Bed-chamber Door, which
I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0095100801:242"/> had been on it in the Morning, as I
had ſome Difficulty to open it to take thence ſome China.</p>
            <p>I aſked her the meaning of it? She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted poſitively
that there never had been a Lock on it, which knowing to be a Falſhood, I
began to be apprehenſive ſome foul play was intended, nor was I
miſtaken.</p>
            <p>I then aſked her for a young Woman, whom ſhe had told me was a
Servant out of Place, that lodged in the back Parlour; ſhe ſaid ſhe was a
Bed in the Garret, and that my Trunk was there alſo; this gave me a
ſufficient Excuſe, as there was no Lock on the Trunk, to go up to her; and
as ſhe had been a Lady's Woman, and very well knew who I was, I told her all
my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and ſhe readily conſented to quit her own Bed and come
to mine.</p>
            <p>We brought down the Trunk between us, and placed it againſt the
Chamber-Door; as the Maid was buſied with her new Gueſts, ſhe took it for
granted I was alone, and therefore reſolved to provide me with 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0095100801:243"/> a Male Bed-fellow, as a proper Conſolation for a
Perſon in my unhappy Situation.</p>
            <p>About ſeven o'Clock in the Morning, not then clear Day, ſhe
very furiouſly puſhed open the Chamber-Door, and told me, one Mr.
<hi>B—k</hi> deſired to breakfaſt with me, who was a Member of
P—t, and a Man of Fortune, and the Perſon who had taken the Houſe. I
told her I never wiſhed to ſee any human Creature, and ſhould be glad I
could hide myſelf even from my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but ſhe, ſuppoſing me to be
alone, directly introduced a Man, full ſix Feet high, and of the moſt
diſagreeable Aſpect I ever beheld—Perhaps it was my Terror that
painted him ſo to my Imagination.</p>
            <p>I ſtarted up and threw my Gown about me, but I was not quite
ſo quick in putting on my Clothes as the Gentleman was, in taking his off,
reſolving, without the leaſt Ceremony to come to Bed to me, I pulled my
Companion, who aſked him what he meant; why, who the D—l are you, you
old B—ch ſaid he: This Lady, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, is publickly known thro' all
the Coffee-houſes in <hi>Dublin.</hi> Had the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man 
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0095100801:244"/> been ſtudying how to diſappoint his own Intentions,
he could not more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done it, as he brought all the Horror of my
Condition full upon my Mind. And as I had no Protector, no Friend, no Guardian,
I burſt into Tears, and told him, if he was a Gentleman, he would not
inſult Miſery. 
<q rend="inline">'Do I occaſion Tears, Madam?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'You do, Sir, and and therefore I deſire you
will depart.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Well, Madam, ſaid he, I beg pardon, I had a
full Hiſtory of you from the Maid of the Houſe, who ſaid, ſhe believed
a Companion would not be diſagreeable to you, eſpecially as ſhe was
apprehenſive you had no Money.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Sir, ſaid I, ſhe is miſtaken, I have at
leaſt enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my Lodging, which I will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately do; and
once more I deſire you to withdraw, which accordingly he did.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>I then prevailed on the young Woman who was with me to take a
Lodging for me, and in about half an Hour I went to it.

               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0095100801:249"/> But I had a
Fellow-Lodger, one Mr. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellan,</hi> an Enſign, who it ſeems knew me
ſo well, that he thought proper to bring the late Earl of
<hi>R—ſſe,</hi> of facetious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and ſeveral other Perſons
of Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to break open my Lodging. On hearing them coming up Stairs,
I ran into the Dining-Room, and locked myſelf in. When thoſe worthy
P—rs could not find me, they threatened to kick the Landlady; and one of
them putting his Mouth to the Key-hole of the Dining-Room, cried, 
<q rend="inline">'Do, my Dear, open the Door; by Heaven! it is
nobody but I, <hi>D—g,</hi> the Fiddler.'</q> I made no Reply; ſo being
diſappointed, they were forced to decamp, curſing and vowing Revenge
againſt the Woman of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>This Accident ſo terribly alarmed me, that I reſolved to quit
this Lodging the next Day; but Mr. <hi>D—n</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to
permit me to depart in Peace; for, being a military Man, he ſtood Centinel at
the Door of my Chamber all Night, frequently intreating me to let him in; but
truly had I been amorouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0095100801:250"/> the Sight of the
various Medicines in his Apartment would have 
<q> 
                  <l>Damp'd all Paſſion ſympathetic.</l>
               </q> For, as I had a
back Room, when this Gentleman was abroad, I frequently, for Variety, went into
his, which looked into the Street.</p>
            <p>However, at laſt he went to Bed; and early next Morning he told
the Landlady that I had kept him awake all Night, and that I was a moſt
notorious common S—t.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'Arah, by my Shoul (ſaid the old Dame) you would

            </p>
            <p>While my Landlady, to whom I had never told my Name, related this
to me, I heard ſomebody enquire for Mrs. <hi>Pilking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> ſo I
deſired to know who it was, and up came a very well dreſt matron like
Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male of about Fifty; ſhe expreſſed great <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0095100801:251"/>
Concern for my Misfortunes; ſaid, my dear Father had ſaved her Life, and
that ſhe was at preſent Houſe-keeper to the Earl of <hi>A—m,</hi>
who was extremely troubled for his Rudeneſs to me, and hoped I would give him
an Opportunity of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging my Pardon. I told her, as I did not know whom to
blame, I wanted no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; it was my wretched Fate to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the
Inſolence of every Fellow.</p>
            <p>She then urged, what I own was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Argument to one not
worth a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that my Lord was very generous, and would, ſhe was ſure,
make me a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Preſent, in Recompence of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror he had put me
into. As I looked on my preſent Circumſtances to be quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate,
being near Lying-in, and having nothing to aſſiſt me, I agreed to ſee
him any where, except at my own Lodging. Upon which the artful old Crone told
me of a Houſe in the Neighbourhood, a very reputable one according to her
Account, where my Lord would meet me in the Evening.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0095100801:252"/>Accordingly I went; but let any one judge of
my Surprize, when inſtead of the Earl, I met a Gentleman whom I had never
ſeen before: So I inſtantly departing left him to his Contemplations. And
in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time it came to light, that the venerable Houſe-keeper of
the Earl, was neither better or worſe than the celebrated Mother
<hi>Brown:</hi> And indeed I received many Viſits from Ladies of her
ſublime Calling.</p>
            <p>And what moſt ſurpriſed me, was, that they were generally
employed by ſober mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Men, and ſuch as to my own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, lived
very well with their Wives; but theſe Ladies aſſured me, their Huſbands
hated them, and would rather have any other Woman. So I found I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in my Misfortune. And if every married Man, who has ever attacked me, does not
ſubſcribe to my <hi>Memoirs,</hi> I will, without the leaſt Ceremony,
inſert their Names, be their Rank ever ſo high, or their Profeſſion
ever ſo holy.

that Language, how he liked her? he ſaid, ſhe was an indifferent Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of her Siſter: But he eaſily perceived, by an Alteration in her
Countenance, that <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0095100801:266"/> ſhe too well underſtood him, and
that he was out of Hope of obtaining her Pardon, unleſs ſomething pretty
could be wrote upon the Subject by way of Apology; ſo I raiſed his Spirits
in about half an Hour after, by ſending him the following Lines.

            <p>Mr. <hi>W—e</hi> now began to make ſome Figure; and tho'
he kept me pretty fully employed, he drove an underhand Trade with Mr.
<hi>P—n.</hi> And as he was not willing that either of us ſhould
believe him incapable of Writing, he uſed to ſhew Mr. <hi>P—n</hi>'s
Work to me, and ſwear it was his own; and in return, he, with the ſame
modeſt Aſſurance, preſented mine to him; but we were too well
acquainted with each other's Stile to be deceived. At laſt, Mr.
<hi>P—n,</hi> not ſatisfied with all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence he put him to in
<hi>London,</hi> made a Demand on him for fifty Pounds; but as Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> had before made the beſt Penny of me to him he
poſſibly could, and <hi>W—le</hi> finding what I wrote paſſed
every Jot as well his, he thought it moſt convenient, if he did diſburſe
any thing, to give it to me, as thinking I moſt wanted it; ſo I was now
full of Poetical Buſineſs, <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0095100801:271"/> by which my Poverty was
relieved, and my Mind amuſed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> was ſo vexed at loſing his Chap, that
in Revenge he endeavoured to inſinuate that we converſed unlawfully
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but this met no Credit, as I very ſeldom ſaw him, and never
alone.</p>
            <p>In the mean time he carried on a vigorous Proſecution againſt
me in the Spiritual Court, in which I gave him no oppoſition; as he
ſolemnly declared he would always allow me a Maintenance to the utmoſt of
his Ability; and to live with him, I by no means deſired. 
<q> 
                  <l>For never cou'd true Reconcilement ſpring</l> 
                  <l>Where Wounds of deadly Hate ſo deep were fix'd.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But no ſooner had he obtained a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from me, but he
retracted every Word he had ſaid; not only refuſing to give me any
Aſſiſtance, but alſo abuſing me, in the moſt unchriſtian,
falſe, and ſcandalous manner, and publickly triumphed in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-reached me. Upon this I was <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0095100801:272"/> adviſed to lodge an
Appeal againſt him, which made him quite mad. He abuſed his Advocate
Proctor, and the Judge himſelf, as all doing him Injuſtice; and tho' I knew
none of them, inſiſted on it, they were Confederates with me againſt
him.</p>
            <p>But this outragious manner of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather injured himſelf
than me; the Delegates were appointed; and as every body whom he conſulted,
aſſured him, he would be caſt, his haughty Spirit was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
capitulate; but nobody would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to deliver his Meſſage to me,
leaſt he ſhould ſcandalize them for it; ſo at length with great
Entreaty he prevailed on <hi>W—le</hi> to make a Propoſal from him, to
me, of giving me a ſmall Annuity, and thirty Pounds in Money, which, in
regard to my Children, I rather choſe to accept of, than ruin their Father,
as I certainly had it in my power to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W—le,</hi> who has really a good deal of Humour, came to
me one Morning after my being a Week without ſeeing him, and in a Theatrical
manner delivered the following Speech: 
<q>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0095100801:273"/>Before I ſpeak the Meſſage of the
Prieſt; firſt give me leave to glory in the Title of his
Ambaſſador.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I wondered what odd Whim had now taken <hi>W—le</hi>; and
begged he would deliver himſelf like a Man of this World.</p>
            <p>He then related the Propoſal afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, on which I
deſired two Days time to conſider, and then acquieſced, and withdrew the
Appeal, like an eaſy Fool as I was.</p>
            <p>Dearly have I ſince repented it, as no Articles of the Agreement
were kept, altho' I thought they were as ſtrongly aſſured to me, as the
Law could make them; in which there are ſo many Loop-holes, that even
Perſons converſant with it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; how then ſhould a Female be
ſufficiently on her Guard, againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of a kind of

where, 
<q>

            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0095100801:274"/>Of the Thirty Pounds, I never received but
Fifteen, and thoſe Mr. <hi>W—le</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me he advanced out of
his own Pocket, and never was paid, as I can prove under his own Hand.</p>
            <p>But Heav'n knows, as I had every thing to provide for a Child, and
myſelf, and Rent alſo to pay, this Sum laſted not long, eſpecially as I
had no Friend near me.—No; nor any honeſt Perſon; for my Landlady, of
whom before I had conceived a good Opinion, when ſhe found I was in Labour,
inſiſted either on my paying double the Rent I had engaged for, or quitting
her Houſe, which, as it was then too late for me to do, I was
neceſſitated to comply with her exorbitant Demand, which made her very
complaiſant.</p>
            <p>Before I had received even this ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief I wrote to many
Ladies, to whom my Father had been Phyſician, and who once ſeemed to be my
Friends; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; their conſtant Anſwer was, that I deſerved
nothing; to which general Rule, I never met with but two Exceptions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0095100801:275"/>I wrote alſo to the B—p of
<hi>C—,</hi> who after long Deliberation, picked out of his Purſe half
a Piece, which extraordinary Bounty, he by the Force of Imagination doubled;
and alſo declared that I had ſent to him for it, a Woman who had been whipt
thro' the Town; who, as ſhe really was a Gentlewoman of good Character, but
of low Fortune, had it not been for my Perſuaſion to the contrary, would
have ſued his L—p for Defamation.</p>
            <p>But as he was ſo kind to give my Son, who is his God-ſon, Five
Shillings in ſmall Change in <hi>London,</hi> which he told the Youth was a
Crown Piece, who knowing there was ſuch a Coin as a Five Shilling Piece of
Gold, ſearched amongſt the Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence narrowly to find it, tho' without
Succeſs, I think I muſt pardon him; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as on my threatning to
expoſe him ſince I came to <hi>Ireland,</hi> he, to bribe me to Secrecy,
ſent me one Pound, a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unaccountable Charity from his
Lordſhip, to any Perſon of whom he had not Carnal Knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0095100801:276"/>And tho' in a Letter of his, he aſſures
me he deſires no public Praiſe for what he has done, and makes as long and
learned a Diſquiſition between the Law of our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and the Law of our
Minds, as he once did between <hi>Graminervous</hi> and <hi>Carniverous,</hi>
which, as I do not underſtand <hi>Latin,</hi> I may very poſſibly
miſpel, tho' their Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is, I believe, Graſs or Fleſh
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Animals; of the later of which, I believe his L—p would make
the beſt Meal. The antient Prieſts were never permitted to burn Fleſh,
but as a Sacrifice to the Almighty; but it is reported, that one of them
turning a Stake, when it was a little too hot, burned his Finger, on which he
licked it, and found it ſo ſavory, that he devoured that part which was
intended for the Gods; and as the Laity beheld him, to their Opinion, breaking
the Law in eating Fleſh, he aſſured them, that he had an immediate
Revelation, that it was lawful for him to eat the prime Part of the Fleſh,
and leave the Garbage for the Laity. Thus we may ſee how early Prieſtcraft
began; from the very firſt, they were Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers; <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0095100801:277"/>
and Prieſts of all Religions are the ſame. Thoſe who want to look farther
into the Deceits of Prieſthood, may trace it up even to the <hi>Nile,</hi>
from whence Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and the Crocodile firſt ſprung, both alike
deſtructive to Mankind.</p>
            <p>It is known to every learned Divine, that the Prieſts
engroſſed the whole Country of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as the eldeſt Son of every
Prieſt was born a Prieſt, and was therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to a tenth part of
the Land; upon which <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was not only an admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Man but
an excellent Politician, and had a Divine Revelation that the Land ſhould
ſuffer Famine ten Years, ordered the Prieſts to pay in all their
Subſidies to the King, whereby, in thoſe ten Years of Dearth, the King
purchaſed, at ſo low a Rate as giving the People a little Corn, all the
Lands in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Theſe are Remarks of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Lord
<hi>Shaftſbury,</hi> whoſe inimitable Style and clear Manner of Reaſoning
carry Conviction with them.</p>
            <p>I never knew any Clergyman who quoted him but to his Prejudice,
except Dr. <hi>Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull:</hi> And yet I cannot ſee why Morality, 
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0095100801:278"/> or the Preaching of it, ſhould in any wiſe be
offenſive to a Chriſtian; ſince there is a certain Beauty in Holineſs,
which, tho' it were never to be hereafter rewarded, gives a ſincere
Satisfaction and Quietude of Mind in this Life,—And therefore Virtue does
ſtill,

need not bluſh to acknowledge them, I hope he will not only pardon my Vanity

            <p>I can only aſſure the World, I believe Mr. <hi>W—le</hi>
never wrote a poetical Line in his Life; and therefore I am indebted to ſome

out of Calamity, which was, to beg Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> to ſend me ſome
Money, to bear my Expences to <hi>London,</hi> aſſuring him I was weary of
<hi>Ireland</hi>; which indeed was true: for I am of the ſame O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with
the pleaſant Lady <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> that <hi>Dublin</hi> is a Place of
the leaſt Sin, and the moſt Scandal, of any City in the World.</p>

            <p>But if my learned Huſband will oblige me with one, I ſhall be

            <p>I am a ſad digreſſive Writer; by which my Readers may
plainly perceive I am no Methodiſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P—n</hi> agreed to my Propoſal; and as he was
fully determined never to give me any more, ſent me nine Pounds, for which,
as he ſaid, he ſold my Diamond Ring to Mrs. <hi>Dubourg,</hi> and the Chain
of my Watch, which coſt ſix Guineas, to Mrs. <hi>W—rr—n,</hi>
for the Promiſe of forty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; for which I ſuppoſe Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi> and ſhe have ſince accounted. A good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Man will
eaſily be ſatisfied with a <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0095100801:290"/> Lady that will return him
a Toy for a Trinket.</p>
            <p>Nothing that ever ſhe got vexed me ſo much as Mr.
<hi>P—n</hi>'s giving her my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Snuff-box, which he borrowed from
me, under Pretence, that taking a little Snuff preſerved him from catching
Sickneſs in Places he was obliged to go to. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to me he had loſt
it; but I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaw it with her, as alſo ſeveral other Things
belonging to me.</p>
            <p>But he is not the firſt Man who has plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Wife to
oblige his —. As this Lady was, I may ſay, the principal Cauſe of a
Separation between the Parſon and me, I thought I had a Right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a
Subſcription from her; which, ſince my Return to <hi>Ireland,</hi> I did in
very civil Terms. And I think myſelf in Duty bound to give my learned Readers
a Taſte of her excellent Style, in anſwer to me.

me; many a Prayer did I offer up to the Almighty for their Preſervation; and
had he not been an infinitely more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Father to them, than their earthly
one proved, long long ago had they been finally loſt!</p>
            <p>My Eyes, even after I went on board the Yatch, were evermore
turned to the Shore of <hi>Ireland,</hi> reſting there as on their laſt
Period; till finding myſelf obſerved, and that ſome of the
Paſſengers, Colonel <hi>Dalway</hi> in particular, wanted to ſee my 
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0095100801:306"/> Face, which I concealed, I pretended to be Sea-ſick,
and deſired the Steward to ſhew me a Cabin.</p>
            <p>He left me for a few Minutes; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, told me, all the
Beds were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; but however, there was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on board, who ſaid,
he would ſooner ſit up, than a Lady be unprovided for. I returned my
Compliments, without ever ſo much as enquiring to whom I was obliged.</p>
            <p>The Sickneſs I feigned proved preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true; for no ſooner
was the Ship under Sail, but I grew violently Sea-ſick; when the Steward once
more entered the Cabin, and told me, the Gentleman, to whom it belonged,
deſired a Moment's Chat with me. I begged him to make my Apology, as indeed,
what with Sickneſs and Sorrow, I was little in Temper to receive any
Perſon.</p>
            <p>However, the Gentleman reſolved not to be ſo eaſily
diſmiſſed; for following the Steward into my Cabin, he told me, he knew
me to be Mrs. <hi>P—n</hi>; that, he could not ſit up all Night; and
therefore, <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0095100801:307"/> he hoped I would not refuſe him the
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſleeping in his own Bed.</p>
            <p>I anſwered, I would not, provided he would be ſo kind as to
leave me for a few Moments; on which, weak as I was, I ſprung out of Bed,
and, as I had not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed myſelf, ſoon met him upon Deck.</p>
            <p>Who this fame Gentleman was, may, in due Seaſon, be revealed: I
can only aſſure my Readers, that, I believe had I accepted of the Offers he
made me, Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would never have approached me, as he was a Man of Honour, or
at leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me as ſuch: A Man of Fortune he certainly is; and I
doubt not but he has enjoyed many a lovely Lady, without promiſing them any
Reward, or offering them a Settlement for Life, as he really did me.</p>
            <p>I dined with him at <hi>Parkgate</hi>; and I hope Virtue will be
rewarded; for though I had but five Guineas in the World to carry me up to
<hi>London,</hi> I yet poſſeſſed Chaſtity enough to refuſe fifty
for a Night's Lodging, and that too from a handſome well-bred Man, whoſe
Name if I ſhould <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0095100801:308"/> inſert, all the World would
acknowledge I ſpoke but Truth of him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſcarcely ever forget his Words to me, as they ſeemed
almoſt prophetic. 
<q rend="inline">'Well, Madam, (ſaid he) you do not know
<hi>London</hi>; you will be undone there.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'Why, Sir, (ſaid I) I hope you do not imagine I
will go into any bad Courſe of Life?'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'No, Madam, (ſaid he) but I think you will ſit
in your Chamber, and ſtarve;'</q> which, upon my Word, I have been pretty
near doing; and, but that the Almighty raiſed me one worthy Friend, good old
Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> to whoſe Humanity I am, under God, indebted both for
Liberty and Life, I had been quite loſt.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay, nobody will imagine he ſerved me from any carnal
Views; ſince, 
<q> 
                  <l>If Truth in Spite of Manners muſt be told,</l> 
                  <l>Why really Seventy-ſix is ſomething old.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So here I cloſe the Firſt Volume; and as it has been
induſtriouſly and maliciouſly <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0095100801:309"/> reported, that I had
in reality nothing to publiſh, I hope this will convince the World, that Mrs.
<hi>Pilkington</hi> was never yet reduced to the Meanneſs of Falſhood or
Tricking. And if this Volume meets with a favourable Reception, I can
aſſure my Readers, the next will be infinitely more entertaining, and is
now ready for the Preſs.</p>
