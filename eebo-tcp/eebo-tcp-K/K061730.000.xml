            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To be a Patriot in theſe days, is to provide a Task for the Tongues of the Envious, and to give Alms and Relieve thoſe that are in want, is immediately ſet down for an Act of <hi>Oſtentation</hi>; elſe, Sir <hi>Charles Duncomb</hi> had ſeen his Countrymen <hi>Reap</hi> the Fruits of what he <hi>Sow'd,</hi> and the Voice of the People had bleſs'd him for giving Ear to the Cry of the Priſoners, and plentifully dealing part of what he was poſſeſs'd of to People in Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>But I give more Offence to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in remembring you of the <hi>Good</hi> you have done, than the <hi>Poetaſter,</hi> who has occaſion'd the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, by putting on the Readers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief by the <hi>Ill</hi> you have <hi>not</hi>; and it is equally troubleſome to be accus'd of Faults

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere being nothing material in the Preface to this ſcurrilous Satyr, that has not been repeated over and over again in the Body of it; I cannot but think it very ſuitable to the Buſineſs in hand, to forbear making any further Remarks on the Poets Indecencies, and apply my ſelf to make Excuſes for my own.</p>
            <p>If the Performance I have let looſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World is Bad, I have nothing to urge in my own defence, but the haſt I was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to make in the finiſhing it, thro' the deſire of two or three Friends, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty there is in anſwering a Pamphlet Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph by Paragraph, which has ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy of Tautologies, as this has.</p>
            <p>I ſhould indeed have made my Reply to it in Verſe, that being counted the fairer way of entring the Liſts with a Poet, but as I never had any great Inclination to <hi>Dactyls</hi> and <hi>Spondees,</hi> ſo I was afraid I ſhould ſhew my ſelf as great a Bungler at the <hi>Trade</hi> of Rhiming as the Perſon has convinc'd the World he is, whom I write in oppoſition to.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:0045102800:6"/>However, ſince he ends his Preface in Verſe, I hope I ſhall ſtand excus'd, if I make uſe of the ſame Method, and give the Reader a ſhort Specimen of my Poetry, after he has tyr'd him with a large one of his. My Intent at firſt, notwithſtanding my ſmall Acquaintance with the Nine <hi>Water drinking</hi> Ladies the Muſes, was to have taken up the Cudgels with him in Verſe, but ſuch a Deſign requiring more Time than I have to beſtow upon Poetry, I thought it adviſable to lay it aſide, that I might drudge on in the Beaten Way of <hi>good Honeſt, Humble</hi> Proſe, and have flung by the following Lines which were written as ſo many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to his two firſt Paragraphs.<q>

            <head>THE True Born-Engliſhman. A SATYR, Anſwer'd Paragraph by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph.</head>
            <p>AS it is the Duty of every one, that breaths <hi>Engliſh</hi> Air, to ſtand up for the Place of his Nativity, and Vindicate the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation from the Reproaches which Malice would faſten on it; ſo I cannot but think my ſelf oblig'd to take notice of a Libel which has ſtoln into the World, under the Name of a Satyr, and diſpers'd its Venom in a conceal'd manner, againſt a People whoſe Reputation in the Arts of War and Peace has rendred 'em Famous throughout all Chriſtendom. Had the Author of it been <hi>an open Enemy, perhaps, I could have born it,</hi> but he is <hi>our Acquaintance, and our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friend,</hi> a Man ſubject to the ſame Laws as <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> are, and Liable to the ſame Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; entertain'd by 'em, when he was forc'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0045102800:9"/>
to fly from the <hi>Scourges</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably receiv'd, when he had not where to lay his Head in a Kingdom which owes her Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this. The Printer alſo is known for what he is, a Sowre, Diſcontented, Canting Fellow, as ever <hi>Murmur'd</hi> at falling <hi>Manna,</hi> or found fault with the Bounties of the Almighty. He has formerly been made City Surveyor, for a Crime of the ſame Nature, and taken a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its Buildings from his Wooden Edifice in the middle of the Street; and one might have thought, unleſs he was in love with that Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Office, he would have avoided all manner of Occaſion of bring <hi>lifted up above his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> again. But He's arriv'd to ſuch a heighth of Malignancy, ſuch an inveteracy of Temper, as to be his Author's Humble Servant, while he was Lampooning his God, and making Sport with the Divine Exiſtence of Him that made Him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not to be ſuppos'd he would ſtick at lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his helping Hand towards Abuſes upon the Country where he would have us think him <hi>Born,</hi> after he had been forward in promoting Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Expreſſions, againſt the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that gave him <hi>Breath.</hi> I ſhall have Field enough elſewhere to take the Author to task, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd he expected it in his Preface, tho' for other ſort of Indecencies, than His <hi>mean Style, rough Verſe, and incorrect Language,</hi> and make appear he labours under a greater ſcarcity of Manners, than the Country he ſhews his Teeth at ever can. We are happy indeed that a Man of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter has no great eſteem for us, and 'tis a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign a People is Good when thoſe who are notoriouſly Wicked, ſpeak reproachfully of 'em; ſince it muſt be granted, few Men fall out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0045102800:10"/>
with their own likeneſs, or are at variance with their own Reſemblance. But <hi>a Man is known by his Works,</hi> and the way to make him appear in his true Colours, is to ſearch into 'em, and find out the Blackneſs of his <hi>Soul,</hi> by the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>Thoughts.</hi> It's fitting therefore we fall into the <hi>SATYR,</hi> and examine whether the Poet be as infamous as the Subject, or he has the ſame Talent of ingratitude in Verſe, as he is celebrated for in Proſe. Mr. <hi>T—</hi> has a fit of Mortification coming upon him, or he would have leſs value for the Hungry Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Mount <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and is reconciling himſelf to his old Jeſuitical Abſtinence and Days of Faſting, or he would ſcarce fall in Love with telling his Fingers, and making wry Faces for adequate Epithets, as he now certainly does. While his verſifying Folly gives us Occaſion to examine his other faults, and make an Eſtimate of the laſt from the wretched Ingredients the firſt is compos'd of. But his Poetry carries ſuch an invitation with it, that it's pity the Reader ſhould be any longer detain'd from it. I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin therefore with the Invocation of his Muſe which I find is but a very ſcurvey one by her Name and to avoid Confuſion, make Remarks on this Celebrated Piece, Paragraph after Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>
