            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HO' the following Papers are of different Forms, and upon different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; yet there appeared no Reaſon, why they might not be all publiſhed together. I take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mentioning this and a few things more to the Reader, becauſe I had a greater Latitude given me by the Perſon whoſe hands the Papers came from; but I have exerted my Powers no further than in not letting the Eſſay on <hi>Self-Love</hi> come out ſingly, which was his Inclination: but I hope
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0039200600:4"/>
I ſhall have the publick Approbation for what I have done.</p>
            <p>I had a long Letter, chiefly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Eſſay,</hi> with ſeveral Hints in it, which I thought the Publick ought not to be depriv'd of; and ſo (with the Author's allowance) I have thrown ſome of them into the <hi>Appendix,</hi> whereof they make the laſt Number. A few of his Words in that Letter ſeem to call for a place here.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I deſign'd to have ſent you theſe Papers ſeveral Years ago. . . . . . I induſtriouſly ſhunn'd taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſome Performances that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd at different times after this ſmall Work was begun and ended, having ſeen them as much deſpis'd by the moſt judicious ſort of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as I thought they deſerv'd. . . . . . All I have in view by the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> is, that it may ſerve for an Introduction to Books of a deeper
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0039200600:5"/>
Reach. . . . . But I took all the care I could, that it might have no Air of a Religious Diſſertation. It was indeed next to impoſſible to avoid ſaying ſomewhat on the Love of God, that the contrary Doctrine might appear the more in its own Colours. . . . . ."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I thought it was beſt to add the D. of <hi>Rochefoucault</hi>'s Deſcription intirely, as being a Run of natural Eloquence, without <hi>Preciſion,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> call it; which makes it rather the more agreeable. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he puts <hi>Self-Love</hi> for Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, ſometimes for Pride, ſometimes for Vanity, ſometimes for Paſſion, ſometimes for Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, ſometimes for mere Whim, and ſometimes for all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as appears throughout his Reflections; but ſtill he will be well enough underſtood: for by <hi>Self-Love</hi> he either means corrupt Nature in general, or ſome of its
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0039200600:6"/>
particular Qualities. But with Submiſſion. . . . . ."</q> See the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of this in the laſt Number of the Additions.</p>
            <p>The Author deſign'd the reſt of thoſe Additions as an Explanation of ſome Terms, and a Collection of ſome Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſupport the Eſſay, tho' it ſtands pretty much independent of either. The Sections were alſo deſign'd to have been of a more equal length, and the whole to have been ſhorter; but he yielded to an Advice of drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in ſome practical Reflections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as he own'd himſelf) abſtract Reaſonings ſeldom make a deep Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Nor was it without Reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, that he engag'd at all in the Performance, having often ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The Nature of Mankind gives little ground to expect an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Opinions once receiv'd; tho' no Speculation ſeems ſo likely for all Parties to agree in, as that of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs, nor any Speculation
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0039200600:7"/>
that could produce ſuch happy Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, if it was reduc'd to Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice."</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Dialogues,</hi> he expreſs'd himſelf as if he had been but a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Converſation, and had wrote only from his Memory; and therefore ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It was to be fear'd it wou'd be a kind of Murder, and at beſt, to preſent the World with a Skeleton."</q> He adds,  <q rend="inline">"It will eaſily be ſuppoſed, the two Friends talk'd of many things I have taken no notice of, and that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was only reduc'd by me under certain Heads, and put in a different Order from what they obſerv'd in talking together; for it would not have been ſo natural to have begun with the Diſtinction of Body, Soul and Spirit. . . . . Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the thing, ſuch as it is, may be of uſe to thoſe who are not much acquainted with themſelves and the World."</q>

                     <p>BUT to go a degree lower than Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation (for Life may be conceived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Operation of the Senſes, as when they are ſhut up in a deep Sleep) ſimple Life is a thing as different from Body, or Matter, as any thing we can imagine. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Life is ſometimes called by the Name of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and conſidered both as a Principle or Spring by which <hi>Matter</hi> (whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is to reſt) is moved, and the Body of

                     <p>OF this ſort of Life or Spirit, every living Creature has a ſhare, a Worm as well as a Man; the particular Frailty of whoſe Life we may be eaſily convinc'd of, tho' the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had not told us <hi>it is but a Vapour.</hi> And yet we have no other Barrier againſt that amazing State call'd Eternity! If the Thought of Death or ſimple Extinction raiſes Horror; what would the Proſpect of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Exiſtence raiſe, without ſome latent Hope, or Suppoſition of Happineſs! A Man makes this Suppoſition ſecretly when he thinks at all of that State, otherwiſe Nature could not bear the Proſpect: and we muſt confeſs our Quiet, or rather Indolence, as to an Article of ſuch importance, is chiefly owing to our Stupidity.</p>

                     <p>BUT notwithſtanding all the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and Weight that loads us, there is ſtill in our Nature ſome Expectation of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, ſome Hopes of a future Life, and a more perfect Exiſtence after this Scene is over. To which, if we add our Deſire of Dominion and Eſteem, even in this World, we may conclude there is really ſomething of worth in us; and our Pride may be a ſort of Argument for our Dignity.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0039200600:17"/>
And this Elevation of Mind is not infus'd into us by Politicians, Divines, Officers of the Army, or any Set of Men whatſoever, but may be ſaid to be a part of our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                     <p>DIOTREPHES <hi>loved Pre-eminence. Caeſar</hi> was not taught to deſire Dominion: every Man loves it (leſs or more) tho' not equally qualified to gain it, nor equally ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. Beſides, the Rewards promiſed by Politicians and Commanders rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Conveniencies and Glory of this Life than the future. And whether the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be temporal or eternal, the encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or the amuſing People with the Hopes of it, ſuppoſes a Deſire in them before-hand of ſuch things; otherwiſe the <hi>deſigning Men</hi> could have no Fund to work upon, and might as well talk to Horſes.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs there are other Arguments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Pride of Man, which may help to ſhew his Dignity. He grows weary of every thing here (Friendſhip only excepted) as if nothing were worthy of his Attention. But then, as nothing is able to ſatisfy him, any thing is ſufficient to amuſe him. So that we muſt conſider Man in different Lights, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can underſtand his Condition; and after all we can think about it, our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muſt remain imperfect.</p>

                     <p>IT is by viewing Man in thoſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Lights, that he is ſometimes called the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Creation, and ſometimes its <hi>Diſgrace</hi>; and both Epithets are true. There is ſtill in Human Nature ſomething that's bright and lovely, good and kind; ſome Remains of Excellency, ſome Ruins of Grandeur, ſome Sparks in the midſt of Aſhes and Rubbiſh.</p>
                     <p>THE Scripture informs us, <hi>that Man was made after the Image of God</hi>; and <hi>that we are his Offspring.</hi> 'Tis remarkable that St. <hi>Paul</hi> cites this Paſſage from a Heathen Poet: and there was great addreſs in it, ſince he was reaſoning with the polite Men of <hi>Athens.</hi> But if our Pride ſhould be apt to riſe from the Account the Scripture gives us of our Origin, we ſhall find in the ſame Books very different Characters to keep us low. We are call'd <hi>but Duſt,</hi> the <hi>Worms</hi> are <hi>our neareſt Kindred:</hi> 'tis told us, <hi>we are but Vanity in our beſt Eſtate,</hi> and that <hi>the Imaginations of our Heart are continually fooliſh and wicked:</hi> with much more to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>THE Philoſophers were much divided in their Opinions concerning Man. Some exalted him too high, others ſunk him too low; without conſidering the ſtrange Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Compoſition, which indeed ſeems
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0039200600:19"/>
to make him a-kin to the higheſt and loweſt Beings, the lovelieſt and the hatefulleſt Things.</p>
                     <p>NOR is it to be forgot, that tho' Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general are made up of Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet, as my Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſays, <hi>Man differs more from Man, than Man from Beaſt.</hi>

                     <p>'TIS a ſtrange Compoſition, Human Nature! But thoſe who talk and write againſt the Dignity of Man, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul; who affirm there is no Virtue, no Friendſhip, no Honour; can only argue from what they feel in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and what they obſerve in the World. The firſt Point might be readily yielded to them: tho' we are not abſolutely ſure but they may have a greater belief of Virtue, and more Conſcience than they own; as there are others who may have leſs of either than they pretend to. And as to the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Decay of Virtue in the World, there is nothing oftner mention'd in the Scripture than that. In ſhort, whatever the Opinions of particular Perſons may be, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature will ſtill remain in its Rank: and the unhappy Choices of the Multitude

THE Action of the Muſcles, and the Motions perform'd by their means, is a new Matter of wonder. As ſome of theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are voluntary, there are others without any deſign of ours. The voluntary Motions are often accompanied with Satisfaction, as the Mind directs them either to real Uſe or Vanity: and we are beholden to the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for Dancing, as well as Walking: to theſe the Politician owes his Shrugs, and the nice Lady her Geſtures.</p>

the Body, its Charms lie principally in the Outſide. The figure of the inward Parts, and the endleſs Branchings of the Veins, are look'd at with more Complacency in Wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work and Copper-plate than in their Reality; which muſt give the Diſſecters themſelves ſome Uneaſineſs, not to be entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the longeſt Practice.

We ſhall leave more Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations to Lovers. In the mean time, we muſt do the Soul the Juſtice to confeſs that 'tis ſhe that's properly the Miſtreſs. No Man can be in love with the fineſt Statue. Nor would Life, added to Beauty, be the Attraction, if ſome Qualities of the Mind were not ſuppos'd.

                     <p>THE Diſſolution of the Body ſhews a little of its Compoſition.

And this ſhould engage People to pity one another, or to be very civil at leaſt.

                     <p>LIFE certainly, in the loweſt view we can have of it, implies ſomething more than Matter, or Matter and Motion together, and may be called <hi>immaterial,</hi> or a thing that cannot fall under the cognizance of any of the five Senſes. 'Tis finer and quicker than Flame: it cannot be extracted by the beſt Chymiſts, nor kept in Glaſſes.

                     <p>BUT of our Neceſſities ſome are real, others only imaginary: both of which ſubject us to great Dependence. By the real Neceſſities, all Men depend upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the higheſt Ranks depend moſt upon the loweſt, who work both for their own Subſiſtence, and for theirs that are idle. By the imaginary Neceſſities, ſome put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Dependence of Men in power, and ſometimes do very dirty work for the Wages they receive. But in all our Wants, whether imaginary or real, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wants nothing; for it feels nothing. 'Tis properly the bodily Life that wants Meat and Cloathing, and 'tis Luxury and Pride that want Delicacies and Ornaments.</p>
                     <p>HOW Life comes to fail, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Repairs it is conſtantly getting, and all our anxiety about it, is only to be reſolv'd into the Will and Appointment of its Author. 'Tis juſt ſuch another Myſtery, that the bodily Frame wears out, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes no longer a fit Habitation for the Soul.</p>
                     <p>CERTAINLY it might have laſted lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and we hear of Lives in the beginning of the world, near a thouſand years old. That

ſome of the ſofter parts harden too much with time, and the Strainers cannot perform their functions, is what Experience ſhews: but a new Queſtion may ariſe, why that hardning of the ſofter parts? Beſides, we often ſee the Machine deſtroy'd before it is half worn, even in Infancy; and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violent Accidents. Man is the pooreſt Creature in the world, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: we may judge how it becomes him to be proud. <hi>Pride was not made for Man.</hi>

                     <p>POOR ignorant Man! The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is as great to know how Life is kindled, as how it goes out. That it enters into the Body, is but a way of ſpeaking: perhaps the Body and it are form'd together. I have ſometimes thought Men have been too pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Glaſſes, and their Enquiries. Whatever be of that, they diſcover nothing to leſſen their difficulties. Nature ſtill keeps her Myſteries to herſelf.</p>
                     <p>WE ſee indeed, in a groſs manner, how we are thrown into this World with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of our Mothers, and pain to ourſelves, tho' we have no remembrance of it.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if Men cannot account for ſimple Life, no wonder they cannot account for Senſe and Feeling. 'Tis much if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> was in earneſt in what he ſays of the Cauſe of Senſe.

                     <p>SOMETIMES one would hardly know whether to laugh or be angry at <hi>Hobbes.</hi> But tho' the Cauſe of Senſation is hid from us, the Advantages of it are very obvious. The Senſes are the Canals of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: they may be ſaid to bring Intelligence to the Soul, and to the whole Man Safety and Delight. They are noble Preſents from our Creator, and we ſee what a loſs it is to be deprived of any one of them. If they are ſometimes the Conveyances of Pain, this is owing to ſome Accidents they are not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for; and very often the Pain is of our own procuring.</p>
                     <p>IF the Organs are indiſpoſed, the Senſes muſt be ſo likewiſe: and if they are loſt the Senſes are loſt. 'Tis the Body that furniſhes theſe Organs, which probably has made the Emperor <hi>aſſign the Senſes to the Body.</hi>

                     <p>THE bodily Senſes are alſo called the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senſes, as they ſerve us in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with things in this viſible World.

a word that may be applied to them all, yet in common diſcourſe it is appropriated to one of theſe five Powers in particular: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ſay, a Sight ſtrikes the Eye, a Sound the Ear. But 'tis the Hand that's uſually ſaid to touch.

A Man may ſhut his Eyes when he thinks fit. But upon the matter, all the Senſes are rather paſſive than active, which I believe you will readily grant.</p>
                     <p>BUT tho' the number of thoſe Operations has been limited to five, the number of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations or Perceptions may be call'd infinite, both as to the Objects and the Degrees.

The Eye can take in half the Firmament, the Ear can hear at a great diſtance, and both can receive inſtruction by words: whereas the other three Senſes (eſpecially the Touch and Taſte) can only act by an immediate Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Object.</p>

                     <p>MANKIND are in ſome deluſion as to that point. Mr. <hi>Boerhaave</hi> and others are very good, for ſhewing the Frame and Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Organs belonging to each Senſe. Mean time the Touch and Taſte are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally moſt gratified, and the Taſte yet more than the former. And to theſe two Senſes may be referr'd all that's call'd Luxury: the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0039200600:40"/>
Smell is but gratified in a manner for diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Elegance is properly the purſuit of the Eye. Sometimes, 'tis true, all Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance is call'd Luxury: as the Luxury of Building, Gardening, Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>TO enter into all the bad Conſequences of indulging the Senſes, were an endleſs Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.

                     <p>BUT the Inconvenience of Senſuality is one thing, and the Injuſtice of it another. Mere ſelfiſh Gratification, without regard to Society and Friendſhip (ſuppoſing the Heart not to be engaged in the Pleaſure) is a thing below Humanity, but 'tis infinitely more agreeable to think of what Nature has done for our ſupport and delight, than what we do our ſelves to our uneaſineſs, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and our diſhonour.

MANY other things belong to the animal Life, which we may call indifferently Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, Actions, Powers, Faculties. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians ſpeak of the action of the Stomach, as well as that of <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking.</hi> What name ſhall we give <hi>Sleeping,</hi> which puts a ſtop to moſt of our Powers and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? What ſhall we ſay of Hunger and Thirſt?

Thus Reſt and Motion are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by turns: and that Faculty of moving from one place to another may be ſaid to enlarge our Confinement, (for we are but Priſoners here on Earth) ſo that the taking a walk becomes a Pleaſure, were it but in a Chamber.

IT ſerves to recall the Images of Things formerly perceiv'd, and ſo they are more lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid than in the firſt Impreſſion; as the Idea of the Sun and Light is very poor and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at Midnight.</p>

It may be called <hi>Dreaming,</hi> tho' we do not entertain theſe Imaginations vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, ſince they are for the moſt part but Caſtles in the Air. Nor is it future Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects only that intrude upon our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: there's hardly a Trifle that we have done or heard of, twenty years ago, but what breaks in upon us, and often the moſt unſeaſonably in the World.

                     <p>THAT may be call'd involuntary Imagination. One and the ſame Faculty may be ſaid to be both paſſive and active.

                     <p>BUT tho' we can tell many things the Fancy can do, 'tis impoſſible to tell every thing. It adds, it pares, it joins, it ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, it mixes, it jumbles, it builds, it razes; in ſhort, it works wonders in its own Shop, and the beſt Deſcription will ſtill be inferior to its power.

Nor muſt it ever be forgot, that ſuch images are quite wrong, or rather no Images at all; that are form'd when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Senſe is wanting or hurt: as in the known Story of the blind Man, that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd Scarlet was like the Sound of a Trumpet.</p>

is impos'd upon, when 'tis the Senſe that's miſtaken; as when the Stick appears crooked in water: but the Error lies neither in the Sight nor in the Fancy, but only in our pronouncing too haſlily. Hence we may ſee the advantage of that great Rule, <hi>Not to judge according to Appearances</hi>; eſpecially in things relating to Religion and common Life. As to Religion, 'tis well known how haſtly Imaginations, or rather haſty Concluſions, bring all things into ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and ruin. And the bad effects of raſh Judgment are no leſs ſeen in Life: we ſee others in a glittering ſituation, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pronounce them <hi>Happy:</hi> and by a natural conſequence think ourſelves miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if we have not the like Finery. <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> makes <hi>Fungoſo</hi> faint away, upon ſeeing another Beau get into the Faſhion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. The ſame ſort of judging obtains in houſhold Furniture, Equipage, and Titles. 'Tis true, it may be call'd <hi>Staring</hi> rather than <hi>Judging,</hi> when we have no other Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Felicity but to gape and admire with the Mob,<q>Qui ſtupet in Titulis—</q> But ſuch is really the caſe, and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence has Imagination both on private Quiet and the publick, that the want of a Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon may endanger a Government. Pride in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mixes with the Admiration: from what

other ſource can it proceed, that a Man in perfect Health is not eaſy to travel the length of a Street, unleſs he have a Coach? and that another is not eaſy in a very fine Coach, becauſe it has not a Coronet?</p>

                     <p>IN ſuch a jumble of Images, ſome Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule naturally falls upon one of the things for its being in company with the other. And ſuch a merry burleſque Vein may be pretty allowable when it brings no contempt on Things or Perſons that ought to be more reſpectfully treated: for in that caſe it is like the hanging naſty Rags upon a fine Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

You may compare what he ſays in the eighth

An Anatomiſt, or a Phyſician, may ſpeak or write his Judgment of unclean things [natural things] becauſe he is not to pleaſe, but profit: but for another Man to write his extravagant and pleaſant Fancies of the ſame, is as if a Man, from being tumbled into the dirt, ſhould come and preſent himſelf before good Company. And 'tis the want of Diſcretion that makes the difference. Again, in profeſt remiſſneſs of Mind, and familiar Company, a Man may play with the Sounds and equivocal Signification of Words; and that many times with Encounters of extraordinary Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but in a Sermon, or in publick, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Perſons unknown, or whom we ought to reverence, there is no jingling of words that will not be accounted Folly: and the difference is only in the want of Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

All poetical Compoſitions (whether in Verſe or Proſe, <hi>the Adventures of Telemachus,</hi> as well as the <hi>Iliad,</hi> or <hi>Aeneid</hi>) are Works of Wit and Judgment both, but are more properly referred to the Claſs of Wit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Invention and Fancy that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in them.

                     <p>IN many Compoſitions, Humour is what appears more than either Judgment or Fancy: and often it deſerves not the name of Humour, but rather of Ribaldry.

                     <p>THE Force and Activity of the Soul appears much more in the Paſſions than in the bodily Senſes, which are but paſſive and languid in compariſon of thoſe violent Commotions, or even in compariſon of the more gentle Affections. When the Paſſions break looſe, they are like Hurricanes and Eruptions of Fire: and they are fitly call'd Paſſions, becauſe we ſuffer under their Dominion. But then, as they are bad Maſters, they are excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; as we uſe to ſay of Fire and Water: and without Paſſions, Life would be a very inſipid thing. For let us ſuppoſe a Man poſſeſt of a Fortune ſufficient to give him all the Gratifications of the Senſes, and that in the moſt elegant way imaginable: let him have Ragoûts and Burgundy, and Dogs and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and what elſe he has a mind for: yet if we ſuppoſe him in the bare ſtate of Senſuality, without Love and Friendſhip; no deſire of Knowledge, no reliſh of giving or receiving Obligations, neither ſatisfaction in Virtue, nor indignation at Vice: ſuch a Man would be reckon'd by moſt People to paſs his time very dully.</p>

ON the other hand, let us ſuppoſe a Man heartily animated with one ſingle Paſſion, it will keep him at leaſt awake; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſatisfying it, will be to him inſtead of the moſt delicious Senſualities, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inſtead of the Neceſſaries of Life.</p>

For there muſt be an Exception as to ſuch Paſſions, or ſuch Forms of them as can produce no good effect. For inſtance, Fear and Revenge: the latter is diabolical, and the former often very baſe. Such a Fear I mean, as is ſaid to give a body to our Imaginations, to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert our moſt valuable Faculties; and which may be called an Alienation of Mind while it laſts: and ſuch a Fear alſo as makes us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from any Duty that would expoſe us to the Cenſure of the unthinking World. Such Paſſions we had better wiſh extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>THE Paſſions, you know, are alſo called Affections of the Soul: for tho' Affection is taken particularly for Love (which word too has its different ſignifications) yet Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Paſſion denotes any Motion or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0039200600:57"/>
Feeling, whether agreeable or diſagreeable. And thus the Paſſions are commonly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the <hi>concupiſcible</hi> and the <hi>iraſcible,</hi> two old-faſhion'd words, but which intimate to us that all the various and <hi>variable</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul turn upon theſe two Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Averſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS Diviſion of our Paſſions, or fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from two Sources, gives indeed no Idea either of Virtue or Vice; but only a general notion of Pleaſure and Pain in the Soul, without any conſideration of Merit or Demerit: ſo that there had need to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diviſion of the Paſſions, into the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> and <hi>Vicious.</hi> But becauſe this way of claſſing them would be <hi>inſignificant</hi> to thoſe, who will not allow the diſtinction of Virtue and Vice; it will be enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them into the <hi>Social</hi> Paſſions, and the <hi>Selfiſh,</hi> or the <hi>Diſintereſted</hi> and the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted.</hi> 'Tis true, thoſe Perſons will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low there is ſuch a thing as Diſintereſtedneſs neither: but they'll at leaſt allow there is ſuch a thing as Compaſſion, Tenderneſs, Kindneſs, (they may chuſe their word) and ſo the Paſſions might be diſtinguiſhed into the <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Unkind,</hi> which I ſuppoſe would paſs current with all the World: ſince the greateſt Advocates for <hi>Self-Love</hi> do not deny that Men can be friendly, but only affirm that their Friendſhip is founded upon their own Intereſt.</p>

                     <p>I think this may be ſaid too, that as Deſire and Averſion (eſpecially when they come the length of Paſſion) imply Want, Uneaſineſs, Trouble, and violent Motion in the Soul; ſo Joy is the Satisfaction, Delight, and Acquieſcence that enſues on our meeting with our Deſires, or even on getting free of our Averſions. Joy is to the Soul what Pleaſure is to the Senſes: (and Sorrow may be called its Pain) with this difference, that true Joy and Sorrow of the rational Soul are ſtill founded upon Reaſon. And in all the Paſſions the Will has ſome more power than in the bodily Feelings, which we cannot augment nor leſſen: the greateſt <hi>Stoick</hi> muſt feel the Gout; the moſt abſtemious Recluſe cannot put a ſtop to his <hi>Taſting,</hi> while the Glaſs is at his mouth. Whereas in the Paſſions or Feelings of the Soul, a Man can either cheriſh them, and conſequently raiſe them higher, or he can make ſome Efforts againſt them, and we ſee they die the ſooner.</p>
                     <p>SIMPLE Deſire, and ſimple Averſion, are juſtly reckon'd blind. And if Fancy may be ſaid to enter often into our Deſires, it enters yet oftner into our Averſions: for we can generally give a better Reaſon why we like, than why we diſlike. So that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Averſions are much owing to ſome diſorder in ourſelves, or our being <hi>out of</hi>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0039200600:59"/>
                        <hi>Tune</hi>; which appears remarkably in thoſe Averſions and Diſguſts that are perſonal.</p>

                     <p>I believe Hope and Fear iſſue from Deſire and Averſion, according to the Views, or the Apprehenſions which the Mind hath of meeting with things agreeable or vexatious. Hope and Fear therefore are ſuppos'd to be attended with ſome reaſon: the <hi>pannick</hi> Fear excepted as before, becauſe it concludes the dreadful thing to be already preſent. Our Hopes ſeldom impoſe ſo far upon us: tho' they riſe very high, and from very narrow Foundations in ſome Tempers, and not the worſt ones neither. But if we conſider Hope as a rational Expectation of the Mind, it will rather come under the Liſt of the Virtues than of the Paſſions.</p>
                     <p>THE natural Fear of Death is wiſely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in us, for the Preſervation of our bodily Frame: and neither the fear of Death nor of Pain is ſhameful, unleſs it make us ſhun what we ought to do, or do what we ought to ſhun.

                     <p>THE Conſtitution of the Body is reckon'd to depend much on the Fibres, the Blood, and the ſolid Parts and the Fluids; from the good or bad Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament or Habit of all which, we may expect the better or worſe Health, the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ſhorter Life. The Complexion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies ſomething more a-kin to the Soul, tho' it ſeems alſo to depend on the more or leſs happy mixture of the Elements, and certain Chymical Ingredients in us.</p>

                     <p>THERE is a ſtrange Variety among Mankind: but to give the preference to one Complexion above the reſt, might be thought too forward and partial. Each Complexion has its advantages, and each has its defects. The ſanguine Perſon would think it hard to be reproach'd for the haſtineſs of his Temper, which ſometimes indeed flies out like Gun-powder; but when he cools and <hi>comes to himſelf,</hi> he is all kindneſs and civility. It is moſt adviſable for the Complexions not to diſpute too much about their ſeveral Prerogatives: for in all ſuch Reckonings, each Party comes off with loſs.</p>

                     <p>THE Complexion and Diſpoſition ſeem to differ in this point, that the latter is a more internal thing than the former. We ſhall find two Perſons equally ſanguine or equally phlegmatick, and yet the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably prouder than the other. Pride is not reckon'd a complexional thing, but to lie deeper in the Soul: (the ſame may be ſaid of Covetouſneſs) and ſome Souls have a remarkable Tendency to ſome predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant thing, almoſt from the Cradle.</p>

                     <p>BUT whatever Inclination prevails in the Soul <hi>for the time being,</hi> the Wits are ſet at work to bring it about. Men are both drawn by Pleaſure, and purſue it: the ſame Perſon, as it were, going out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for what he cannot find within. 'Tis true, 'tis for his own ſake that he goes thus out of himſelf: but then he often goes on the Errands of a Fool, or a Madman: ſo that the Term <hi>Self-Love</hi> might be with as great propriety chang'd into Self-Will; and 'tis in this view that the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> takes it when he ſays, it will purſue things not only frivolous, but deſtructive, <hi>merely becauſe it will.</hi>

But whether we look at home or abroad, the nature of things will continue the ſame: and we may make this general Concluſion as to the difference between the Complexion and the Diſpoſition, that 'tis the Complexion which makes us <hi>quicker</hi> or <hi>ſlower, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> or <hi>colder,</hi> and the like: as 'tis from the Diſpoſition, that we are more or leſs <hi>proud, humble, cruel, mild, covetous, honeſt,</hi> and whatever falls under the Denomination of Vice or Virtue.</p>

Good Humour, or good Temper is more properly good Diſpoſition; and to be in good humour, and good-humour'd, are different things; the worſt-temper'd Perſon being ſometimes in good humour.

There is only this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Conſciouſneſs</hi> between them, the one knows what it is doing, the other not: but both are under a like <hi>overbearing unvir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> Neceſſity.</p>

                     <p>THE Term <hi>Liberum Arbitrium</hi> ſuppoſes the Underſtanding to act without any byaſs, or rather without any thing that may darken it; in which caſe it may be ſaid, to act freely and neceſſarily both: <hi>freely,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not hinder'd, as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> ſays of the River; and <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> becauſe its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to ſee and judge. But there is ſtill a further Power of chuſing, after all Tryal and Examination is made. If it be alledged that this choice it ſelf is determined; it may be ask'd by what? If'tis by the reaſonableneſs of the thing, then the choice is as it ought to be; but it cannot be ſaid to be <hi>neceſſarily</hi> determin'd, becauſe it might have been (and often is) otherwiſe; that is, contrary to Reaſon.</p>

                     <p>HERE is my Opinion without cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.

                     <p>ACCORDING to theſe three Regions in the Body, the Pleaſures are generally claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and denominated.

The Mind ſees the Order and Value of Things, their Relations, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; and this either by immediate Intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like the bodily Eye, or by a ſort of Proceſs, which conſiders one thing after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo is called both <hi>Reaſoning</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>

                     <p>THUS Reaſon, or Judgment, is taken both as a Faculty and as an Act. We ſay <hi>a Perſon of Judgment,</hi> or <hi>of no Judgment</hi>; a Judgment given, and the like.</p>
                     <p>YOU know Reaſon is alſo taken for the Cauſe or Motive; as <hi>ſuch a Law is founded upon ſuch a Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a thing has no Reaſon in it,</hi> or <hi>no Senſe in it.</hi> The ſame words are uſed promiſcuouſly for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, and 'tis but a dry affair to adjuſt their Significations.</p>

For this purpoſe the Mind puts things in a certain order, as Figures in Cyphering, that we may find out the Sum, the Remainder, the Proportion, or whatever we want to

know about them. Theſe three Operations of <hi>numbering, weighing,</hi> and <hi>meaſuring,</hi> ſeem to anſwer to the ſeveral Exerciſes of Reaſon; and ſo 'tis compared ſometimes to a Ballance, ſometimes to a Line.</p>
                     <p>REASON then muſt fall into the groſſeſt Miſtakes, when it meddles in things beyond its Line, or out of its Sphere: in this caſe 'tis like an <hi>incompetent Judge,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions muſt be abſurd. <note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0039200600:84"/>
we judge thus coolly on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And as Liberty was conſidered but as a power to make uſe of our Faculties in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſo the laſt ſtep of Reaſon is to make its choice, which it does (in ſound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſs'd Minds) according to the nature of Things; or, in other words, according to the Truth.</p>
                     <p>AT preſent, we are ſuppoſing Reaſon to be entire, ſo far as it goes, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the narrowneſs of its Limits, nor the Clogs that are upon it, nor whether theſe Clogs are moſt owing to the Appetites or the Paſſions. All ſuch Diſcuſſions are endleſs.</p>
                     <p>TAKING Reaſon therefore only for the natural Light of the Mind, we may well enough conclude, that natural Truths, or Principles, belong to it, as viſible Objects belong to the Eye. Knowledge is but the ſeeing things as they are, or in the way they are deſign'd to appear to us: for, ſtrictly ſpeaking, we ſee few things as they really are, no more than we ſee the Sun in the Firmament as he is.</p>

                     <p>WE may thus have ſome little Idea of Faith, Reaſon, and Revelation; the laſt of which (like the drawing of a Curtain) gives a Diſcovery of what the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers of Man, or the preſent Frame of his Underſtanding could not find out,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0039200600:85"/>
By Revelation Men might be inform'd of the ſtate of Things, paſt, preſent, and to come; of Things relating to the viſible World and the inviſible, of Things <hi>in Earth,</hi> and Things <hi>in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>WE may likewiſe ſee how Faith is taken in different Senſes: one acceptation of it is Truſt, Confidence, Dependence; another acceptation is Honeſty and Fair-dealing, <hi>bona fides.</hi> But the acceptation relating moſt to the preſent purpoſe, is that <hi>Divine Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Underſtanding,</hi> whereby we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuſe our aſſent. And tho' <hi>we ſee but through a glaſs darkly,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, (and how few ſee like him!) yet the leaſt remove from Infidelity is a kind of Faith: and if there is but an <hi>honeſt Heart</hi> to receive it into, it will grow like <hi>the greateſt Trees</hi> from <hi>the leaſt of Seeds.</hi> Nor is a Man to be diſcouraged if he does not perceive its growth; and even tho' he ſhould think he had no Faith at all. Such a dark uncertain ſtate, as it is very afflicting, may perhaps alſo be purifying. But to ſay the truth, moſt people are in the contrary ſtate, rather inclin'd to think their Faith greater than it is, than leſs: and ſuch Perſons would do well to conſider what Faith is, and examine their own by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Definition, who calls it <hi>the Subſtance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of Things not ſeen.</hi> We
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0039200600:86"/>
ought to take great care that our Faith be not found to be bare <hi>Opinion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THUS we ſee alſo that there is a difference between Faith and Reaſon, or that ſome things are <hi>ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> and others <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</hi> I only wiſh it were conſider'd how Religion and Society ſuffer by ſetting theſe two Gifts at variance. Religion ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers when things are <hi>obtruded</hi> as Articles of Faith, and an Aſſent required to them under the higheſt Pains, without ſatisfying the Mind that ſuch Articles are of the <hi>boaſted</hi> Importance, or even that they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to common Senſe. 'Tis true, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion cannot properly ſuffer: but Society, or the particular Members of it, ſuffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different ways; Perſecution and Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy mutually exciting each other. All Hiſtories, eccleſiaſtick and civil, are the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Regiſters of mutual Oppreſſion, Bigotry, and Contempt among all Parties. And yet all Parties muſt make uſe of Reaſon, either <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> when they argue for their Faith; otherwiſe there muſt be nothing for it but an Act of Parliament, and a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army. The Proteſtants are profeſſed Admirers of Reaſon, their Faith hangs upon it; and the Papiſts, who ſay <hi>they believe upon the Authority of the Church,</hi> muſt make uſe of Reaſon to prove the Church is infallible.</p>

                     <p>WHAT is <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>higheſt</hi> in Man, is certainly the moſt agreeable to be thought on. He has a Mind made for the ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Truth, the Diſcovery of it, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0039200600:93"/>
in it: and all this may be granted even to the <hi>natural Man.</hi> We have St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s word for it, <hi>that the Gentiles who had not the Law, did by Nature the Things contain'd in the Law.</hi> But he tells us alſo, <hi>the natural Man knoweth not the Things of God,</hi> and even that <hi>they are fooliſhneſs to him.</hi> Upon which account the natural Man (if he would be a wiſe Man) ought to be very humble; and tho' he had come to all the Knowledge and Virtue of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, to follow his advice, <hi>to take care leſt he fall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IN ſhort, as the natural Underſtanding, or the Mind, was conſidered by ſome Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers both as the Diſcoverer of Truths, and the Director of the Affections, (and the Horſes will be confeſs'd to be very unruly) ſo the Spirit, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſenſe, muſt be look'd upon as the Director of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it ſelf, and as it were a Deity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us: and thoſe Philoſophers even look'd on Man as a Temple where ſome Divine <hi>Genius</hi> reſided, and have almoſt made uſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Expreſſions, <hi>grieve not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>IF it ſhould, let St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Philoſophers anſwer for it. It is indeed a <hi>high Flight,</hi> if Men can get into that true

Spirit to ſee things as they are, to put the eſtimate upon them they deſerve, to love them according to their dignity, and from the proper motives. This is truly a <hi>Flight,</hi> above Self-Love; and what Human Nature, as it is now fetter'd, cannot poſſibly attain unto, without ſuperiour aſſiſtance.

                     <p>I ſhould not indeed wiſh to add to the number of our Faculties: ſince it were the ſame thing, as to our Happineſs, whether we

had many or but one, if that one could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the Offices of the reſt. So if it be alledged that what is called <hi>Divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> is nothing but the making <hi>new</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries to the <hi>old</hi> natural Underſtanding; I ſhould readily enough give up the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it were own'd that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Man to make thoſe Diſcoveries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but then I know not what to make of thoſe expreſs words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, whoſe words the Clergy at leaſt will grant me are not to go for nothing.</p>
                     <p>BUT tho' Reaſon be confin'd to natural Knowledge, its province is ſtill very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: it can examine ſeveral things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation it ſelf; for inſtance, <note n="*" place="bottom">This was meant of things propoſed to our Belief by others.

And as Life can be call'd nothing but the inconceivable Knot that holds Body and Soul together, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can Death be called any thing but the Diſſolution of that Union; 'tis but a Ceſſation of Life, or the retiring of the Soul, which is often in great concern and horrour to think of being driven out of its Lodging.</p>

in this World, the Soul is no leſs dependent upon the ſupreme Being for all its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Enjoyments both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>David</hi> ſays upon good ground, <hi>He holdeth our Souls in Life.</hi> For tho' Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is natural to the Soul <hi>made after the Image of God,</hi> yet it may be conceiv'd capable of extreme anguiſh without Objects to nouriſh and delight it; ſo that a ſtate of that kind were rather to be called Death than Life, and is ſo called in ſacred Writ.</p>

                     <p>NOT only are the Objects of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to be reckon'd Gifts from our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but the Faculties themſelves are Gifts.

Love always ſuppoſes an Union with, or a deſire after ſome other thing than the Subject that loves; ſo that, Self-Love would be found an Impropriety, if one had a mind to quarrel with common Expreſſions. For what is it that a Man calls <hi>Self,</hi> or <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> but a Creature endued with certain Appetites, Deſires, Qualities, or whatever they may be called? And what can he make of <hi>himſelf,</hi> without Objects adapted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to his Wants? Again, what can he owe to himſelf farther than Care and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, which every animated Creature,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0039200600:106"/>
in ſome meaſure, has a ſhare of; and in which there is nothing to be blamed or praiſed? If it be ſaid, a Man owes himſelf Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; this is not as he is ſuch a particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but as he is one of the Human Species: and he had beſt take care not to think too often of his particular Qualifications, leſt they appear to him greater than they do to others, and make him alſo overlook his Defects.</p>

                     <p>NATURAL Affection, Love, and Friendſhip are ſatisfied by the Solaces and Endearments proper to the Soul and Body; and were it not for the ſelfiſh Principle, many of our Satisfactions would be much greater than they are. 'Tis true, the broken State of things makes all our Enjoyments very uncertain, and we often find our ſelves unexpectedly bereaved and deſolate. But if the higheſt Faculty in Man were exerted, or, which is much the ſame, if his Love were principally directed to the higheſt Object, perfect Satisfaction would readily follow; at leaſt Man would be in the State of Order, and where he ſhould be: if divine Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were denied or ſuſpended, it would be but for a while, and the reſign'd Soul would have Contentment in the Divine Will, whatever Deſertion or Pain it might ſuffer. The bearing our natural Afflictions is recommended upon the ſame Principle.</p>
                     <p>IT muſt be own'd, this State of Mind, in which God is loved for himſelf, is not at preſent natural, like our other deſires: we naturally love created things, or deſire them for our Convenience; but the Love of the Creator may be call'd a ſtranger to us: it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0039200600:109"/>
cannot dwell with <hi>Self-Love,</hi> for either the one or the other muſt give place.</p>

                     <p>MOST certainly. Mean time in this Review of Man, the Diſtinction of Body, Soul, and Spirit, may ſtill be had recourſe to; or the Senſes, the Affections, and the Underſtanding. This laſt is called the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Part by <hi>Antoninus,</hi> who makes little account of the inferiour Powers, as being in common with the Beaſts. He makes a kind of Diffection of ſome Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures (perhaps a little too far) and ſpeaks of them with diſparagement. But every Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as well as every Motion of the Soul, is ſurprizing to think of. Even Smelling, which is counted the moſt frivolous of all the Senſes, is of more uſe than we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and in fact we ſee it can raiſe the Spirits as it were by Magick.</p>

                     <p>'Tis generally in favour of the Senſes that the Paſſions are exerted; theſe are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd and riſe in arms, when our Pleaſures are <hi>in danger.</hi> It belongs to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to regulate the Paſſions or Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or, in other words, to keep the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in order: for it cannot alter our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations or Feelings. And if it be ſaid that the Underſtanding, which is but paſſive it ſelf, like the bodily Eye, cannot be called the Leader of the reſt of the Faculties; it muſt be granted, that (ſtrictly ſpeaking) it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0039200600:110"/>
is rather the Light than the Guide: for if we conſider it in the <note n="*" place="bottom">

The governing Power therefore muſt be ſomething of Life, Force, and Activity, which ſets all the other Faculties at work; and tho' the Will is a more vital Principle than the Underſtanding and the Memory, the Spirit may be conſider'd as ſomewhat ſuperiour to the Will it ſelf, ſince the ſame Perſon may have a very different Will at different times. Sometimes the Will is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageable, ſometimes obſtinate; a Man will not ſo much as hearken: What is it that makes him reflect and yield? Sometimes the Perſuaſion is addreſs'd to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſometimes to the Heart; and Intreaty commonly prevails more than Reaſoning. The Memory is only applied to as a Regiſter.</p>

                     <p>SHALL we ſay then, that there is a firſt Mover within us, a Mind, Rector, or preſiding Faculty over the reſt? Indeed we may be indifferent what is concluded in ſuch Speculations, for it will not alter the ſtate of the things. People frequently do ſpeak of ſuch a leading Principle, and of a Spirit in Man: and then this Spirit is as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently denominated, or receives its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, from any Quality that appears moſt prevailing, not only with regard to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Diſpoſitions, but even the Complexion, Temper, Genius, and whatever is moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the Perſon: thus we ſay, a <hi>proud Spirit,</hi> a <hi>violent Spirit,</hi> an <hi>active Spirit,</hi> and many other kinds of Spirits (ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſome worſe) that are to be met with in the world.</p>

                     <p>To aſſert the Superiority of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Spirit (or if it ſhall only be called the Human Nature) above that of other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals upon this earth, has been the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of many Perſons, who (I cannot but think) have made their Syſtem more cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent than thoſe who have endeavour'd to put Men and Beaſts upon a level. Some of this laſt Party indeed acknowledge the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that Mankind have from the Frame of the Body and its Organs, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend makes all the difference. But what Texture of the Brain is ſufficient to perform all the various Operations they aſſign to it, Senſation, Reflection, Wiſhing, Loving, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?

a going. The Bee and the Elephant have little reſemblance of each other in their outward figure, and there may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as little in the <hi>Texture of their Brain:</hi> but each performs very remarkable things; for which there had need to be recourſe to ſome inward Principle actuating their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Machines.</p>

                     <p>THE ſame Concluſion holds as to Man: whatever is perform'd in him, bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Actions called Vital, ſuch as thoſe of the Heart and other inward Parts, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Action of the Soul upon the Body, and the Change is firſt made within; the Soul is touched before the Blood fluſhes out in the Face, to proclaim either Baſhfulneſs or Anger: and the Notion of a <hi>Contact,</hi> and <hi>reciprocal Action</hi> betwixt the Soul and the Body, is but a way of ſpeaking; for if it were ſtrictly true, the Soul would depend as much on the Body, as the Body does upon it; or rather, all would be reduced to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, according to <hi>Lucretius:</hi>
                        <q>

'TIS pretty evident the Soul moves the Body, as the Hand moves the Glove; but that the Body moves the Soul, is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. If they ſay Muſick ſtrikes the Soul, and raiſes different Paſſions, and Muſick is Sound, and Sound is Body; and therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may be granted that bare Senſation is excited by the means of bodily things, as all Sounds make impreſſion upon the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but in Muſick you know all Ears are not equally affected, ſome People only hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bare Sound, without being ſenſible of the Harmony, and ſo are ſaid to have no Ear. Much leſs is it mere Sound that raiſes any Paſſion in us, but ſome other thing that we have no name for; as it is not mere Words that touch the Heart, even in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Expreſſions, but the Perſuaſion we have of ſome Friendſhip deſign'd by them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Compliments affecting us but little.</p>
                     <p>BUT in all this, they'll ſay, the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Man does not appear, the Beaſts hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Senſations and Paſſions as well as He: a Dog or a Horſe is ſenſible of a kind Word and a gentle Stroak.</p>

underſtood by Voluptuouſneſs in Eating and Drinking, and all Pleaſure and Indulgence of the Body, abſtractly from Elegance and Parade, which are properly the purſuit of the Eye, and are peculiar to the Human Kind, as well as Pride; the Beaſts contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with plain Senſualities.</p>
                     <p>COVETOUSNESS ſuppoſes both a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of fine things, and a ſuperfluous abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them; <hi>Pride</hi> a deſire of Diſtinction and Superiority.</p>
                     <p>SENSUALITY alone, without ſuppoſing Covetouſneſs and Pride in company with it, is look'd upon as an inoffenſive thing; and if a Man falls into Intemperance of any kind, all the harm is ſaid to be done to himſelf.</p>

                     <p>BUT it rarely happens that Senſuality is free of the other two Vices. Our Fancy ſuggeſts to us imaginary Wants; and alſo makes us think Nature is not ſo eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented as we find upon Experience it is. Thus we covet things both as to Quality and Quantity: and then our Pride, which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom aſleep, wants to have Witneſſes of our Magnificence, and of our elegant Taſte. 'Tis ſaid <hi>Luxury wants many things,</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs all things</hi>; but Pride is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt inſatiable of the three.</p>

                     <p>WHAT is condemn'd under the name of <hi>Senſuality,</hi> is not the Senſation of Pleaſure, for there is no Crime in Feeling; but in the exorbitant Deſire of Pleaſure, and the Exceſs of the Indulgence, by which the Mind is indiſpoſed for other Attainments. <hi>Antoninus</hi> allows Man to indulge his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as he is an <hi>Animal,</hi> but with this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it make not his Nature worſe, as he is an Animal endow'd with Reaſon and deſign'd for Virtue.</p>
                     <p>IN this View, the harſh Idea of <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> would be ſoftened, as contributing to our higher Intereſts, tho' its proper and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Foundation is only upon Juſtice.</p>

                     <p>VERY true, luxurious People may agree together better than the Covetous can be ſuppoſed to do. For the natural Effect
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0039200600:123"/>
of Covetouſneſs is to diſunite and alienate Men from one another; every Individual aiming at nothing leſs than to engroſs what belongs to the whole Society. Such Men, ſays the Prophet, would <hi>add Field to Field, till there be no place; that they themſelves may be placed alone in the midſt of the Earth.</hi> The covetous Man would leave the World to ſtarve, whereas the Luxurious, tho' without deſigning it, is an Inſtrument in the hand of Providence for ſupporting many, who would otherwiſe be deſtitute; and ſo Luxury in ſome manner ſupplies the place of Charity. Indeed the Luxurious cannot be acquitted of Injuſtice; for it is not <hi>Fair-dealing</hi> that one Man ſhould drink as much Wine, or any other Liquor, as would cheriſh the Hearts of twenty; and that the Expence of adorning his ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, might keep a greater number from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked.</p>

What is moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is, that this graſping ſelfiſh Temper ſometimes produces a ſort of illegitimate <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and renders the poor Miſer hard-hearted and uncompaſſionate to himſelf.

Self-Love, or rather Pride, is ſaid to <hi>live upon nothing,</hi> and to find its account in Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terities and voluntary Mortifications, from that deſire of applauſe; tho' Pride ſeldom takes that way of ſhewing itſelf in this Iſland.</p>

of which it may be called the Parent.

                     <p>THERE are other effects of Pride more undiſputed, to wit, Hatred and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; the Pulpit declares againſt theſe: and the Stage, tho' it does not always ſpeak ſo diſhonourably of them as they deſerve, yet it ſhews many of their bad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

                     <p>As we are inform'd that Man's Pride brought ſuch diſgrace upon him, ſo we are inform'd by the ſame ſacred Hiſtory (tho' in few words) that he was tempted and ſeduced by a Spirit of more cunning. 'Tis much eaſier therefore to account for the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> than for that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd firſt. Only St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of the Angels <hi>who kept not their firſt ſtation,</hi> and a Prophet mentions <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s affecting an equality with the <hi>moſt High:</hi> by which Pride is generally believ'd to be the firſt Sin. But the difficulty ſtill remains how it could ever have enter'd. Ingenious Men have given their Conjectures, but it ſeems to be one of thoſe <hi>ſecret things</hi> which <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God.</hi>

                     <p>WE know how things ſtand at preſent with regard to Man, all his Faculties, the Earth he treads on, and the Elements that ſerve him, and often maſter him. It were an endleſs, as well as a melancholy Task, to enumerate all the Infirmities and Diſeaſes of the human Body alone; ſome of theſe ſo very painful and loathſome, that Nature ſhrinks at the very thought of them. If we are told that Pain is confin'd to that <hi>Senſe</hi> alone which is call'd <hi>Feeling</hi>; 'tis very true that racking Pain or Torture, and indeed all thoſe uneaſy Senſations which commonly go under the name of Pain, are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0039200600:137"/>
confin'd to that <hi>Senſe</hi>; the Nerves being ſtretch'd out of their natural Poſition, or whatever be the cauſe: but the reſt of the Senſes have their uneaſy Senſations too; the <hi>Smell,</hi> the <hi>Taſte,</hi> the <hi>Eye</hi> and the <hi>Ear</hi> are grated and offended, or in general ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd very uneaſy, whatever Term the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs is expreſs'd by. A delicate Perſon would be ſhock'd to find himſelf led into an Hoſpital, or to have a Liſt of Diſeaſes laid before him; all repreſentations of Pain and Naſtineſs are diſagreeable, two things (however) the Body in its preſent State is very liable to. And the general tendency of all Bodies, animate and inanimate, to Corruption and Diſſolution, is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</p>

                     <p>IF the Diſorders of the Mind were inquir'd into, they would be found in no ſmaller number; and the diſcovery no leſs unpleaſant. The Diſorders of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the moſt harmleſs, but often exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melancholy to behold; as any body will acknowledge, who has ever ſeen a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Even the common Diſtempers of the Fancy in thoſe that are not reckon'd quite out of their Senſes (we may ſay in their beſt Senſes) are not the marks of an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal State. And it were pretty well, if all that could be ſaid of a Perſon, were, that he is a little fanciful: <hi>Dark, Sullen, Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh,</hi> are leſs agreeable Epithets; <hi>Unjuſt</hi> and <hi>Cruel</hi> leſs ſtill.</p>

I am ſtill glad to ſuppoſe there is ſome Righteouſneſs remaining even after the Fall. Nor will this claſh with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the character he gives of the new Earth <hi>wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs</hi>; for tho' it is to dwell there openly and in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, a little of it may lurk here under a Cloud.

                     <p>THERE are really ſo many good things remaining after the Fall, that one would ſometimes think there had been no <hi>Curſe.</hi> Nor muſt we take that word for an execration, ſince it is chiefly to be taken for a change to an inferior from a ſuperior State. We cannot indeed know how great the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0039200600:140"/>
change is (and 'tis much for our eaſe) the Scripture being ſo ſhort in the Deſcription of the former State. To conſider only the Body: tho' it is called both <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>vile,</hi> yet ſtill it has its attractions, and whatever is ſhocking about it, is well diſpoſed of, out of ſight; to ſay nothing of the uſefulneſs of thoſe things that may be counted the <hi>vileſt,</hi> as the Gall it ſelf. Then, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Spirit which inhabits this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as there is a congruity that ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould be ſo lodged, or impriſon'd, let it be conſider'd what diſorders would be committed if this Vehicle were not ſo groſs and heavy as it is: what would greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Strength and Agility have produced but more miſchief. How good is it for the publick Quiet that we are ſubjected to Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt, Cold, Wearineſs, and all the reſt! And if we are deſign'd for a higher State after this, ſuch Defects and Vexations ſeem alſo deſign'd to keep us from doating upon this Jayl: for, as Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"to aim at Honours here, is ſetting a Coat of Arms over a Priſon-Gate."</q>

                     <p>IT may be granted to the <hi>ſevere</hi> Men, that whatever is the bare reſult of Complexion is no Virtue; 'tis but a mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical ſort of thing, nor can it be called Vice neither, as being but a tendency of Nature to its Relief or Pleaſure, without any reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mind upon the <hi>Moral</hi> Good or Evil. One may have naturally a greater Thirſt than another, and drink more to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy it, and yet be as ſober as the other.

of Chaſtity, as if it were their greateſt Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and Trouble; whereas Men have much more to ſtruggle with of that kind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves without much blame from the World.

                     <p>I differ very much from them. But ſuppoſe it were yielded; the Conſequences would not be ſo dangerous, if it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that whatever we have that's good is <hi>free Gift,</hi> and that of our ſelves we cannot think a good Thought, no more than we can keep our ſelves in Life and Health. The only Queſtion is, whether we are not born with ſome Tendencies to Virtue as well as to Vice? I ventur'd to ſay above, that there is ſtill ſome Honeſty and ſome Friendſhip in the World, which ſome of the Advocates for Self-Love do not deny, maintaining only that 'tis all for our own ends: but I would beg leave to put the following Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>MAY not a Judge give a juſt ſentence without any view to Applauſe, or any fear of Cenſure? He may be ſuppoſed to be in ſuch Circumſtances, that his Name ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be heard of; and his belief of a future State can likewiſe be ſuppoſed to be very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0039200600:149"/>
or nothing. May not a Merchant give up a fair Account, when he might give up a wrong one without all poſſibility of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery? We can ſuppoſe the ſame of all Truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, and whoſe Belief may be ſometimes of the ſame ſize with the Judge's. So much for Honeſty in dealing. Then may not a Man eat and drink moderately and unexpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, from a better motive than <hi>the Fear of being ſick,</hi> or for ſaving his Money? And, to ſuppoſe a greater Temptation, may he not abſtain from violating the tendereſt Right of another, when he might encroach with all the ſafety imaginable to his own Perſon? It were hard if the ſame favourable Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition could not be made for the Sex, as if the Fear of Diſcovery were their only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. Have not they the ſame Senſe of Juſtice, and a much greater Senſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, implanted in their Nature? But to talk of ourſelves, if a Man had two Women in his power, and equally charming, but the one free, and the other not; it were a ſtrange perverſeneſs to go <hi>deliberately</hi> to his Neighbour's Property, merely for the ſake of encroaching. It was <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>that if Right was to be violated, it was only to be for the ſake of a Crown:</hi> which ſhews a natural tendency to Juſtice when there is no temptation to the contrary; and I ſhall eaſily grant that Men are overcome with very ſmall temptations. But it is enough in the preſent Enquiry, if it can be ſaid that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0039200600:150"/>
they would naturally go the ſtraight Road, if there was nothing to allure and ſeduce them. Even when we are deceiv'd 'tis under ſome ſpecious appearance or other; <hi>decipimur ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie Recti</hi>—So that if we ſhould allow that a Man might be ſo perverſe as to wrong his Neighbour in the point already mention'd, we may ſuppoſe him to have been previouſly deluded by falſe Ideas of Glory and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry; he has imagin'd it <hi>a pretty thing</hi> to break thro' all Laws, 'tis a ſort of Conqueſt too, and he can talk of Favours he has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and of more than he has obtain'd.</p>

                     <p>AS to Friendſhip, it will perhaps be alledged, there are ſo many endearing things in it, that we are ready to do good Offices to our Friends becauſe we are fond of their Perſons; ſo that in this affection there can be no Virtue: a Man would not cheat his Friend, no more than he would cheat his Son, becauſe he loves him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IT muſt be confeſs'd, that where there is true Friendſhip there is ſurety enough for fair dealing, and all the good that can be done beſides; Love is the ſtrongeſt of all tyes. But if an honeſt Man ſhould have to do with <hi>known Cheats</hi> (a thing that may readily happen) will he not find himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to give them fair play?

                        <hi>You'll be undone,</hi> and one may really be at a loſs: but this lively piece of Poetry (every body knows) is not to be ſet up as a ſtandard of Virtue, and at the bottom it is rather a banter upon Vice.</p>

                     <p>I believe 'tis difficult to determine whether Men are more capable of Honeſty or of Friendſhip: both are comprehended in Virtue, and both ſeem to be natural. But Men differ from one another very much in their Tempers and Diſpoſitions; ſome are ſtrictly honeſt to all, but very limited in their Affection. If the Benignity be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, it will draw Honeſty along with it:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0039200600:152"/>
but the contrary cannot be affirmed. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Virtue in general may ſo far be ſaid to be <hi>innate,</hi> or of our own growth, (let the Word paſs) that all the Inſtances of it are pleaſant to hear of, Friendſhip and all other Sentiments of Humanity, Juſtice and all that falls under the Idea of Honour; ſome of which Sentiments are upon occaſions actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exerted in Minds corrupt enough, good Offices are honeſtly done; and perhaps none are born ſo very corrupt, as not to wiſh they could do better. The Underſtanding ſees very often what is right: if the Will follows it but ſeldom, there are at leaſt Intervals of regret, and a Man is angrier with himſelf than with all the World.</p>

                     <p>HAD not the Author of our Nature implanted in us ſome tendency to Virtue, we might have had ground to complain of our unhappy Conſtitution and of his Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (greater than that of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters) in requiring ſo much, and furniſhing ſo little. <note n="*" place="bottom">Book III.</note>

And he adds,  <q rend="inline">"ſhould that moſt unſhaken Rule of Morality, and Foundation of all ſocial Virtue, <hi>That one ſhould do as he would be done unto,</hi> be propoſed to one who had never heard it before, but yet is of Capacity to underſtand the meaning; might he not without any abſurdity ask a Reaſon why?

                     <p>IT would be ſtrange, I think, if a Man of capacity to underſtand the meaning of that Rule could really want a Reaſon for

obſerving it. It muſt be ſuppoſed he has ſome Notion of Right and Wrong, or he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee the Obligation of any moral Rule, let it be put in any Shape or Terms what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. If he has any Notion then or Senſe of Equity, his Friend the Propoſer can have ſome acceſs to his Mind, and will be able to make out the Reaſonableneſs of that Rule to him in ſome other form of words more adapted to the ſlowneſs of his apprehenſion; for the Defect muſt be only there. The Principle is innate, only a particular Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition may not chance to be aſſented to on the firſt hearing; or there may be no innate Idea of a moral Propoſition, any more than of a mathematical one, before the firſt hearing, and even not 'till certain ſteps are made for getting at the bottom of it. But as to that ſacred Rule of doing as we would be done unto, 'tis highly probable, that having been given by the Saviour of the World, and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the ſimpleſt Multitude, every Man will ſee the Reaſonableneſs of it at a glance, and alſo wiſh (if he is not wholly abandon'd) to be able to put it in practice.</p>

But to return to the Helps of Religion: Sincerity and common Senſe being ſuppoſed, a Perſon that finds himſelf ſo indigent and out of order, will naturally have recourſe to Prayer, either with words or without them. Finding that he is far from being ſelf-ſufficient, he will readily ask the Aſſiſtance of the Almighty; for it is here likewiſe ſuppoſed that he has ſome Belief of the ſupreme Being, and a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0039200600:161"/>

                     <p>AGAIN, ſuppoſing our imperfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to have been born in a Chriſtian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to have read the Bible, he will ſee more poſitive Marks of the divine Goodneſs, which will incline him to Praiſe and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, as well as to Prayer: Fear would ſeem to be the Source of the latter, as Love is of the former. Even the Writings of ſome Philoſophers, (<hi>Plato</hi>'s in particular) ſhew us the propereſt kind of Prayer, which is, <hi>to refer to the Deity to chuſe what is beſt for us.</hi> His Dialogue named the <hi>ſecond Alcibiades</hi> is well known, and upon that Model <note n="*" place="bottom">

but to whoſe ſhare they ſhould fall heavieſt, would not be eaſy to know, without more labour than People commonly are at before they cenſure. A reaſonable Diffidence therefore of our ſelves, and a due reſpect for others, may be reckon'd among the chief Helps to Religion, tho' they are properly two States of the Mind which produce one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and the Eſteem we bear our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours contributes to make us love them, which is a great part of our Duty accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, and without which the other part is impracticable: for <hi>He that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>

'Tis true, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Athenians, God made all Nations of one Blood</hi>; which ſhews a common Relation among Men, as well as an Equality: but how this Relation is minded, every body knows.

But if we could ſuppoſe a Company of any grown-up People to have met together by ſome uncommon Chance, unleſs they agree that one or more of themſelves ſhall have the Rule, there is great likelihood of War to enſue among them.

                     <p>WE have as yet talked of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Characters among Mankind, chiefly with regard to their Fortunes, and 'tis theſe indeed which make their natural Characters appear more remarkably; ſo that the ſame may be call'd natural and accidental both.</p>
                     <p>WITH reference to Religion: Every Body knows 'tis accident, for the moſt part, that makes us of one Religion, rather than another. 'Tis either the Religion of our Parents, or the Religion of the Times; and our Parents ſeem to have been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the ſame way that we are. This is with reference to Forms and Syſtems. Thoſe Defects and Blemiſhes in Religion, called <hi>Superſtition, Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and the like, are owing to the particular Temper of Perſons, and not to the Syſtem they eſpouſe: for we ſhall find ſome of the ſame Profeſſion very warm, and others very indifferent.</p>
                     <p>THERE is hardly a Pamphlet comes out, that does not take notice of thoſe two Characters. Both the Superſtitious and the Enthuſiaſts, I believe, have a deſign of pleaſing the Almighty, and the Enthuſiaſts imagine they pleaſe him better than they do: the Superſtitious have more of Fear than Pride, and ſo they are rigid Obſervers of little things, without which they think there is no Salvation. Both Characters may meet
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0039200600:182"/>
in the ſame Perſon, but 'tis the prevailing one that gives the Denomination. Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm is apt to deſpiſe all Obſervances, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition to magnify and multiply them.</p>

                     <p>THE Diſeaſe of Enthuſiaſm has more or leſs dangerous Effects, both for Society and the Perſons themſelves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tempers it ſeizes. If a Man whoſe Pride is not exceſſive ſhould fancy himſelf inſpir'd, or cloathed with ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Commiſſion from Heaven, the Government may be pretty ſafe from his Attempts: but if one ſhould think himſelf God's peculiar Favourite, and that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was given him on account of his ſingular Merit, or even tho' his Fancy ſhould not carry him to the Extremity of Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he but thinks himſelf a peculiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, it will be enough to make him ſet up for temporal Dominion, and fight, (if he have Courage) like <hi>John of Leyden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BIGOTRY and Zeal may be call'd the Offſpring of Superſtition and Enthuſiaſm.</p>
                     <p>CARELESSNESS in Religion, is much the ſame as the having no Religion: it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds partly from Stupidity, and partly from the Love of Pleaſure. The Contempt of Religion is chiefly from Pride, or the Love of Independency. Hence, 'tis eaſy to trace the Sources of Atheiſm and Deiſm.</p>

                     <p>MEN of publick Employment, ſuch as Officers of State, Judges, Lawyers, Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have more or leſs time for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, according to the Nature of their Employments and their Diligence in them.</p>

                     <p>IT were neither kind nor civil in this Argument, to forget the Women; for they can ſpeak too. But to ſay the truth, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſpeaking for ſpeaking ſake is not their general Character: they are more active, more foreſeeing, and better Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers than we.

                     <p>IT were too ſevere, however, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that a Man never opens his mouth but out of vanity, and that he never goes into Company, but with the View of <hi>leaving a reſpectful Impreſſion of himſelf.</hi> Such Reflections wou'd lead to Melancholy. They ſerve but to imbitter Life, or at beſt to make it taſteleſs. Nor are they true in fact; for a great deal of that Talk or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of Words which ſeems to proceed from Vanity, is often but meer Habit or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity. And juſt ſo in the caſe of Detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which tho' it ſeems to ſpring from Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature and Vanity both, yet is rather a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Cuſtom than any thing elſe: indeed the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> ſays, <hi>'tis more from Vanity than Ill-nature that we are Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers</hi>; which is a milder Conſtruction than he generally makes of Actions: but I humbly

                     <p>THERE are certainly other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to Converſation than Vanity and Ill-nature. There is Curioſity, Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Friendſhip. The Mind naturally deſires Knowledge, tho' there was no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſhewing it to others. That Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which is the bare Itch of hearing a new thing, is much the ſame with Amuſement. But Friendſhip may concur with both, or it may be alone the Inducement of going into Company; there being a pleaſure in the very ſight of Faces, where no great Information is to be expected.</p>

But to dwell too much upon Hiſtory will not be diverting, and therefore Allowance muſt be given to ſomething that's more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, and tending a little to Mirth; with this Caution always, that it be at no body's expence, either in the Company or out of it.</p>

Diſpoſition Men have to laugh; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures have not, nor the Faculty it ſelf. Monkeys can grin, but it hardly comes up to laughter?

                     <p>I ſhall not ſet up to be a Caſuiſt; but we ſee in Fact, that one of the greateſt Plots in Life is to laugh: even drinking would go heavily down without it, tho' Men are not wholly indifferent about the Liquor neither; yet to laugh, ſeems more to be the End of their meeting, than to drink.</p>

Excellency in it, we have but to conſider that 'tis only frivolous Things that make us laugh moſt; a Word out of joint, an odd Geſture, and the like.

                     <p>IT ſeems <hi>Sneering</hi> is meant both of ſcornful laughing and ſcornful ſpeaking, and is far from being a pleaſant Thing. There is a Severity in it, as it expoſes a weak ſide, or a <hi>Ridicule,</hi> a thing that no body is reckon'd to be free of. 'Tis a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maxim, that every Man has his Whim and his Ridicule. There is likewiſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Ridicule as well as perſonal; and there is the Ridicule of every Profeſſion: but it belongs rather to the Play-houſe, than private Converſation, to lay open theſe Infirmities. 'Tis true, the Stage is ſeldom ſucceſsful in the Cure: but it is at leaſt of ſome uſe to let People ſee the Follies of their Neighbours, and if they will not look <hi>at home,</hi> the Stage cannot help it. But as new Queſtions ariſe at every turn, it may be ask'd who ſhall correct the Stage when it goes wrong it ſelf? I know no Cure for Dullneſs; but plain Immorality is a ſtaring thing; and the Wiſdom of the Legiſlature muſt take notice of that, the beſt way it can.</p>

                     <p>AS to the Attention that ſhould be given to frivolous Diſcourſe, 'tis enough if one appears to give attention to it; he may take ſome liberty of thinking with himſelf of what he has a mind, and a Nod now and then will be enough. There ſhould be ſome Appearance of Attention, or elſe it would be very mortifying; like what is told of the Prince of <hi>Lucca,</hi> who hearing a tedious Diſcourſe one day, of which he took little notice, and the poor Man, who began to perceive it, making an Apology for having ſpoke ſo much; anſwer'd, <q rend="inline">"You need make no Apology, for I hardly know what you were talking of."</q>—This

                     <p>WHEN a Perſon happens to have ſuch a Value for the Bible, he will of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence make it a good part of his Study; and will approve of other Books on Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as they ſhall appear to agree to that Standard.

Nor let him think
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0039200600:205"/>
that Dullneſs is confin'd to the Labours of the Pulpit, and Works of Divinity; ſince not only the Workmen for the Stage, who muſt labour for their Bread, but even fine Gentlemen who might live at their eaſe, and yet labour for Eſteem, do often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Works of great heavineſs.

                     <p>AFTER Books that treat expreſſly of Religion, thoſe of Morality have the next place.

                     <p>MORALS and Divinity are by no means to be ſeparated. And as to thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that are properly called Books of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, 'tis among the old Philoſophers they are principally to be ſought after. Not to ſay but ſome of thoſe great Men have alſo left many Inſtructions concerning Religion, and Diſcoveries of the divine Nature; as a ſmall Acquaintance with <hi>Plato</hi> and ſome others will teſtify. Tho' <hi>Socrates</hi> wrote nothing himſelf (in which he reſembles the great Inſtructor of Mankind) yet we have his Sentiments and his Manner of Life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by thoſe who were familiar with him, and at the ſame time the fineſt Hands in the World. <hi>Epictetus</hi> wrote none neither, but we have that Loſs ſupplied by <hi>Simplicius</hi> and <hi>Arrian.</hi> Nor are the Poets to be overlook'd among thoſe ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Morality being their aim too in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dreſs.

All Searches are painful, and much rubbiſh muſt be turn'd over before coming at the beſt Books, and before coming at what is <hi>excellent</hi> in ſeveral
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0039200600:207"/>
Books that are not deſpicable. This I mean of ſome Books where Inſtruction is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended: where it is intended more covertly, the Authors have a better Excuſe to plead for the Rubbiſh that muſt be turn'd over. And the Reader's Intention being often Amuſement, he will ſtill find his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count leſs or more, even in that View.

                     <p>THERE are two kinds of Books al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exploded a while ago, the voluminous Romances and School-Divinity. It was pity ſome of the School-men had not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd their Talents upon more ſolid Things, for they have been great Men, and had a Senſe of Religion; but their metaphyſical
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0039200600:211"/>
Subtilties made their Writings of little uſe to the World, and ſerv'd principally to nouriſh Diſpute and Contradiction. The Writers of large Romances had ſome very good Ideas of Virtue; but all was loſt in tedious Narratives: and ſometimes they gave too favourable Ideas of Vice, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in particular. Our Novels deal moſt in Scandal.</p>

                     <p>CONSIDERING the great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Humours, 'tis no wonder there is the ſame as to Books. But when a Man reflects on the Variety in the former, it will hinder him from <hi>preſcribing</hi> or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending Entertainments in the latter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that People are generally beſt pleas'd with their own Choice. You will ſee, I have here chiefly in view the Books deſign'd for Amuſement. Harmleſs Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery is univerſally acceptable. Gibing is pretty paſſable, and 'tis the more honeſt when it diſcovers itſelf in the very Title of the Performance; for inſtance, <hi>the Praiſe of Folly, a Tale of a Tub,</hi> and the like. If a daſh of unlucky Humour happens to mingle, 'tis what an Author cannot always help. Sneering is ſeldom taking, becauſe of the Air of Inſincerity that attends it: there is ſomewhat more agreeable even in Writings of <hi>profeſt Remiſſneſs,</hi> to uſe Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Expreſſion. I ſhall not ſay poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that all Books are to be read, but every
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0039200600:212"/>
body will agree that many of them may be read with very little Attention. . . . . . . I'm ſorry I can't ſee you again for ſome days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to go a little into the Country.</p>

               <head>DISCOURSE I.</head>
               <head>Decency is the leaſt of all Laws, and the moſt obſerved.</head>
               <p>THIS Reflection we have from an eminent Perſon, who knew the World very well; and it ſhews how much we ſtand in awe of the Opinion of Men. But whence comes it, that we are ſo very much afraid of what others will ſay of us, even when we have a very mean Opinion of their Judgment? Words are but imaginary Laſhes, and ſtill more when we do not hear them; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſome would chuſe to undergo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Whipping, (if no body was to ſee it) rather than undergo the Laſh of Cenſure. And this dread of Cenſure goes yet farther: we are afraid of what others will think of us, as well as of what they will ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0039200600:215"/>
AND here 'tis all one, whether Decency has any real Foundation in Nature, or if it ariſes only from the Fancies of Men; ſince it is the Fear of Reproach that chiefly makes us avoid indecent Things, or what paſſes for ſuch in the Eye of the World: tho' it cannot be fairly deny'd that there is a <hi>real,</hi> as well as an <hi>imaginary</hi> Decency; as there is <hi>real,</hi> as well as <hi>imaginary</hi> Honour: and tho' the Reality of both is deny'd by a few Perſons; 'tis a great queſtion if they are in earneſt.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be granted that Decency, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imaginary or real, reaches no farther than the Outſide and Circumſtances of an Action, without rendering it either <hi>morally</hi> good or bad, virtuous or vicious. <hi>Decent</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Lawful</hi> another. 'Tis unbecoming to eat alone, when a Man can have Company, tho' no body reckons it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: in ſome other Actions no Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are to be admitted, for very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And the <hi>Cynicks</hi> who had all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Decorum</hi> in ſuch contempt, only diſcovered their own Pride, and Ignorance of Human Nature, the Dignity of which muſt needs put our Actions under different Regulations from thoſe of inferiour Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0039200600:216"/>
IF any ſhould ask, How we make out this Dignity of human Nature? it might be anſwer'd, that the Power which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency has in the World, is at leaſt a ſtrong Preſumption of ſome Reſpect, juſtly due to the Sentiments of our own Species; for we are not afraid of what Dogs and Horſes will think of us. And we may judge of this Power of Decency by its being ſuch a Reſtraint upon Pleaſure, ſometimes in the moſt Voluptuous.</p>
               <p>DECENCY then owes its force to ſome tacit Conſent, and Conviction of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mankind. What may be call'd <hi>real</hi> Decency, has its Foundation in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Congruity of Things; and what may be call'd <hi>imaginary,</hi> depends only upon Cuſtom. If any has a mind to call it <hi>cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> Decency, as being a ſofter Term, I ſhall eaſily go into it.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems to be this laſt ſort of Decency, which the Duke <hi>de Rochefoucault</hi> calls <hi>the leaſt of all Laws</hi>; by which Term he would ſeem to have an eye to the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Religion and Humanity, the Laws of the Land being tolerably well <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd</hi> for fear of temporal Puniſhment. And ſome Things belonging to Religion are pretty well obſerv'd too, either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Matter with our Conſciences,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0039200600:217"/>
or to get the Name of religious Perſons, or at leaſt to be call'd Obſervers of good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>THERE is even ſome Reaſon for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving cuſtomary Decency, or the Modes of the World, in things that are harmleſs, of inferiour Claſſes; becauſe an Affectation of Singularity muſt be Pride or Folly, or both. If a Man, for inſtance, living in a Country where they wear Hats, ſhould wear a Turbant, how impertinent would this be? In things that are not unlawful, nor too inconvenient, a Compliance ought to be given, both on our Neighbours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and our own. Why ſhould we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend others, or expoſe ourſelves to laughter for nothing at all? Indeed if the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by this Decency appears unlawful, (about which a Man's own Conſcience muſt be ſatisfied) he is to ſtand as firm as he can: and if the thing is too inconvenient (which muſt be determin'd by his Prudence) a Compliance in this caſe would be want of Senſe, as in the former it would be want of Religion. Altho' a Man is to wear a Hat, he is not obliged to have a new one every Week; nor to put Lace about it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch Hats were as much the Faſhion as once were Shoulder-knots. But as ſome things are evidently fantaſtical as well as ſuperfluous, it would ſeem Deference e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Cuſtom to comply with it, only
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0039200600:218"/>
in things of the latter ſort; and a good Mixture of Folly will be found even in theſe. There is no help, one muſt be a little fooliſh, in a fooliſh World.</p>
               <p>IT were much eaſier to lay down general Rules, than to point out all the Exceptions and Limitations that are to be made upon them. <hi>The World abounds in good Maxims, but the Difficulty lies in the Application.</hi> We ſee imaginary Decency often interferes both with Religion and Prudence, and often gets the better of both: but the greateſt wonder is, that even Pleaſure ſometimes ſubmits to it.</p>
               <p>THE Matter ſeems plainly to ſtand thus: we are at more pains to pleaſe the World, than either to pleaſe our ſelves or the AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY. The Foundation of all which is the vain Fear of getting a mean Character among the few Perſons that know us, or among thoſe that chance to hear of us.</p>
               <p>'TIS true, there is a Deſire of Praiſe, as well as an Averſion to Reproach; but ſince they both produce the ſame good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and may proceed from the ſame Vanity, 'tis a matter indifferent which of them be conſidered as the Foundation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, <hi>that great Diſturber of Quiet and Pleaſure:</hi> as in another view it may be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0039200600:219"/>
called the great Security of our moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>CIVILITY and Politeneſs are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this Notion of Decency we have been talking of, which is but a ſort of Tenderneſs for our own Character: But there may be a Civility really proceeding from a Fear of making others uneaſy, which may be call'd a Branch of Humanity, and is capable of continual Advances in true Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>SOME Hints given by <hi>Cicero,</hi> who had the Practice of Decency much at heart, may be of good uſe to fix ſome Notion of the thing itſelf. Speaking of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Words <hi>Oportet</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,</hi> he ſays to this purpoſe:<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>THIS great Man always diſtinguiſhes carefully between things of a perpetual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and ſuch as only depend upon Times, Places, and Characters; and he is ſo willing there ſhould be nothing wrong even in the ſmalleſt matters, that he has not forgot to mention the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Gait.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE had but little occaſion to ſay any thing about Dreſs, and ſome other Points of Decency that perplex the World now, ſuch things being at that time under more ſtated Regulations.</p>
               <p>IT would appear ſometimes as if the Apoſtles themſelves had not look'd on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency as a thing altogether unworthy of their Care; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>honeſt things in the ſight of Men.</hi> 'Tis true, the two Words which are tranſlated into <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt</hi> and <hi>decent,</hi> and by ſome Perſons ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicul'd, are uſed promiſcuouſly by that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; but they would ſeem in ſome places to denote ſomewhat of a lower Order than the Duties of Religion and Morality. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may be conſidered as being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to <hi>ſhameful,</hi> when it does not imply <hi>moral Turpitude,</hi> but only ſome Improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhocking to the Eye; as when he ſays
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0039200600:221"/>
                  <hi>it is a ſhame for a Man to have long Hair,</hi> and that <hi>Nature even teaches the ſame.</hi> No doubt this Inſtance has appear'd ſtronger at that time than it does now: but we need obſerve no more about it, than that there are ſome natural Congruities and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities, neither to be call'd Virtues nor Vices, which Perſons of good Taſte muſt be more ſenſible of than others; and 'tis generally reckon'd, the Ancients had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Taſte than the Moderns.</p>
               <p>INDEED any body that knows the World but very little, will ſee how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Difficulties muſt ariſe from the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Cuſtoms of Men, and their claſhing Opinions concerning Decency, now that Plainneſs and Simplicity of Manners are baniſhed the World. Some new thing happens every day, or almoſt every hour, to put one's Diſcretion to the trial; for 'tis impoſſible to have Rules for every thing laid down to our ſelves beforehand. We find <hi>Cicero,</hi> for inſtance, adviſing to treat People according to their Ranks and Offices, which is certainly a good Rule in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. But how are we to treat thoſe Perſons whoſe Rank is not fix'd, nor their Office known? If their Fortunes are made, that is, if they have got ſome Money (the quantity of which is not fix'd neither) it is not uſual to enquire any farther, but to treat them according to the Value they put
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0039200600:222"/>
upon themſelves; and we find they make their way into the greateſt <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> of what kind ſoever. But as this Indulgence may be a good expedient to make ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons eaſy, it muſt naturally make others uneaſy at the ſame time, who look upon the ill-plac'd Reſpect as if it were ſo much robbed from themſelves.</p>
               <p>FOR as Decency reſpects not only a Man's own Character, but the Character of thoſe he muſt hold Commerce with in the World; the difficulty of obſerving it with reference to others, is often greater than with reference to one's ſelf alone. For tho' the World will meddle to judge of a Man's fulfilling his Character purely as to what he owes himſelf and his Station, yet in dealing with others, he muſt both ſatisfy thoſe that are not concern'd and thoſe that are; the laſt of whom will be ſo much harder to pleaſe, that they are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as well as Judges.</p>
               <p>IN ſhort, there are ſo many little things to be obſerved under the Notion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that, as matters now ſtand, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very troubleſome Affair. In the Inſtance of perſonal Reſpect, there ſeems to be a Contradiction between the Rules given by <hi>Cicero</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> which might be ſuch a ſtrait upon Chriſtians, as to make them free themſelves from very much
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0039200600:223"/>
of the Burthen. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> ii. 1.</note>The Apoſtle forbids the Reſpect of Perſons in very plain Words, and gives a very plain Example of unjuſt Preference and Partiality. 'Tis true, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tendency of this would not be to overturn all Civility, it would rather make it more equal and extenſive: For another Apoſtle bids us <hi>honour all Men</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 17.</note>. But the Face of Chriſtianity is ſo much alter'd ſince thoſe times, that in ſeveral Things relating to Politeneſs and cuſtomary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, I'm afraid we muſt follow <hi>Cicero</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Apoſtles; ſince it would be an ill-ſuted thing, and contrary to true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, to join the Forms of primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity with the Spirit that now prevails, which may be call'd a modern Heatheniſm. I ſhall leave this Point without any further Explication.</p>
               <p>THE firſt thing that occurr'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Decency, was the Power it has in the Actions of Men, without regard to its Foundation in nature: but it ſeems there is a real Congruity in things, altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent on Fancy or on Cuſtom; and the Violation of this Congruity, or Order of Nature, is in ſome Caſes not only <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent,</hi> but <hi>abominable.</hi> If any body ſhould ask a proof of this Aſſertion, I know not how it could be prov'd by any thing clearer than itſelf. An Appeal may be made to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0039200600:224"/>
any Man in his Senſes, whether he is not perſuaded there is <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral? If any ſhould deny ſuch a Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would ceaſe to be a Member of Human Society; and all Correſpondence muſt be given up with him: as if one ſhould deny there is any difference between Light and Darkneſs, or bid us prove that we ſee and hear, we muſt take leave and part. Even thoſe who would pull up the Fence of worldly Decency, would introduce very wretched doings: but they will make very few Proſelytes, while the Deſire of <hi>pleaſing</hi> is ſo rooted in the Heart of Man.</p>
               <p>MOST People are not only convinced of the Diſtinction of Right and Wrong in things of higheſt conſequence, but they allow it to take place even in Trifles. There are certain Demonſtrations of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which are more or leſs ſhocking to the Eye: but as ſuch things are properly the Dancing-Maſter's care, ſo an Error as to them is not to be called Incivility, but Aukwardneſs. An honeſt Farmer may be a very civil Perſon, tho' he knows not how to make a Leg: and his clowniſh Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is even more agreeable than finical Airs and Speeches.</p>
               <p>SUCH things are indeed but arbitrary ſigns of Civility, and purely depending upon Cuſtom; tho' ſtill there is a better and a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0039200600:225"/>
worſe manner of performing them. And it were ſtrange if the Mind of a rational Creature, made for Truth and Benevolence, were not ſhock'd with things of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral kind, as well as the Eye is uneaſy to ſee ſuch frivolous Incongruities.</p>
               <p>THE very word <hi>Bienſeance</hi> ſuppoſes there is a natural Fitneſs or Agreement, or ſomething that every body underſtands by the words <hi>proper, becoming, fit, ſeemly,</hi> and twenty more to the ſame purpoſe; which may have taken their Riſe from ſome ſenſible Ideas, as that of People's Clothes <hi>ſitting well</hi> or hanging well about them; the Taylor being here the great Law-giver. And hence Decent Pride has come to be a current Expreſſion, for 'tis certain that one Perſon's Pride has a more becoming air than another's.</p>
               <p>TO ſay that all this proceeds purely from Cuſtom and Education, is to begin at the wrong end: for theſe are founded upon Decency, and not Decency upon them. Imaginary Decency will allow Cuſtom a large enough Province, but real Decency will allow it no Province at all. It ſtands upon it's own Foundation. And when Inſtances are brought from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Behaviour of the <hi>Hotentots,</hi> and ſuch rude Tribes, to overthrow Decency in all its Acceptations; the Objection can
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0039200600:226"/>
have little weight againſt the general Senſe of Mankind in all Ages. Theſe poor People are certainly ill educated, and ſo are many of the Polite World in a different reſpect. Education is commonly but a ſervile Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of others; the Rule that Parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in bringing up their Children, being to make them mere Apes, as they have no better ſtandard of Life themſelves: and ſo the World goes on. But the miſtake is in ſuppoſing that Education conſtitutes the Beauty of Things, whereas it only helps us to ſee it; as a Muſick-Maſter may be ſaid to help the Ear to perceive the Harmony, at the ſame time that he teaches the Hand to play. And here indeed we ſee the force of Cuſtom very remarkably: the external Practice is not only facilitated, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reliſh is improved alſo. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent hearing good Muſick, and the ſeeing good Painting, improves the Taſte in both; and the contrary tends evidently to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it.</p>
               <p>NOR can this Influence of Cuſtom be denied in matters of Vertue, and even in Speculations. As ſome little things in Dreſs and outward Behaviour are call'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Decent</hi> or <hi>Naſty,</hi> juſt as they happen to be faſhionable or unfaſhionable; many Perſons have hardly a better Rule either for their Opinions or their Practice. But as Philoſophy cannot pretend to account for
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0039200600:227"/>
thoſe Impreſſions; all the uſe that ought to be made of the Obſervation, is to guard againſt bad Examples, and to think as freely and deliberately as poſſible. I have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd in any of theſe little By-reflections concerning the Dignity of Man, and the Order of things, to carry the Notion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency any higher than was given of it at firſt; that is, only as it affects the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our Actions, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us innocent or guilty in the ſight of Heaven. 'Tis very true, that every thing that's ſinful is indecent, the leſſer being comprehended in the greater, but every thing that's indecent is not ſinful; and many things which the World would reckon indecent, are far from being ſo in reality. But the Vexation that ariſes upon Cenſure, or the Fear of incurring it, works ſo ſtrongly upon that Fund of Shame within Mankind, that they hardly do or omit any thing without putting the Queſtion (as it were) to themſelves, <hi>What will be ſaid of it?</hi> And it is well that this reſtraint is in the World.</p>
               <p>THERE is indeed a <hi>true</hi> Shame, as well as a <hi>falſe:</hi> or rather, it takes its Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the things we are aſham'd of. If they are contrary to real Decency, the Shame is juſt; either when we feel it or fear it: if they are only contrary to Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Decency, the Shame is fooliſh. But
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0039200600:228"/>
the Confuſion and Dejection of Mind may be the ſame, as People are ſometimes really frighted at a Shadow. The <hi>mauvaiſe Honte</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> often means Baſhfulneſs, which is much owing to the Complexion; the Blood being more eaſily put in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in ſome Perſons than others; and the Appearance it makes in the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is far from being unbecoming in the <hi>Sex</hi> and in young Men.</p>
               <p>THAT the Paſſion of Shame is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Mankind, is generally agreed on; as alſo that it is often the Reſult of Pride, another Quality peculiar to our Species. Fear and Fierceneſs belong to other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, but they are hardly touch'd with Shame, or capable of reflecting on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of their Actions: all their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſudden, and they go directly to their Aim. If in their Anger they ſeem to deliberate before they attack, it muſt be from ſome Apprehenſion of getting the worſt: but in following their Appetites they have neither Reflection nor Remorſe. In which reſpect Mankind, are not ſo happy, who have their Pleaſure to gratify, and their Character to ſupport at the ſame time; and when the one or the other muſt give way, Decency pleads for the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and is ſometimes hearkened to, and ſometimes not.</p>

THE greater the Pride is, this Decency has the greater Dominion. We find every body complaining of the Tyranny of Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which is, in other words, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Decency. But it gets a new Dominion from the Elevation of Perſons, or their Rank in the World: for tho' the meaneſt Perſon has his Pride and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies to obſerve, yet they are far more numerous and troubleſome to thoſe in higher Stations, who, having for the moſt part little elſe to do, contrive many fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, and ſubject themſelves and others to the Obſervance of them. And as the World is the School where theſe painful Rules are learned, the thing chiefly recommended is the Acquaintance of People of Faſhion; and the Advice is by no means to be deſpiſed: but it ſhould be remembred, that the World is alſo the School of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein Self-Love is more nouriſhed than either Virtue or true Decency, which may be call'd its Offspring; ſo that we ſhould look out for Perſons of Virtue and good Taſte, in order to form our Manners, as well as to make our few Days paſs with the leſs Chagrin.</p>
               <p>OUR Quiet muſt certainly have ſome other Foundation than the Decency of the World, or we ſhall have no true Quiet at all. We may well hug our ſelves
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0039200600:230"/>
a little in the Concealment of our Actions and Motives, and reckon it <hi>clear Gain</hi> what is thus hid from the Eyes of Men; but ſtill many Diſcoveries will be made againſt us, notwithſtanding our ſlaviſh Hypocriſy, ſo long as we have no better Principle than the Deſire of Men's Eſteem, or the Fear of their Reproach. Any body may conſider how poor a thing a Life muſt be that's ſpent in Grimaces and Airs, tho' Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were out of the queſtion. Even our Obſervance of Punctilio's ought to be from the Heart, that is, from an honeſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to ſhock our Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And upon that account chiefly the Treſpaſſes againſt Decency of all kinds are to be avoided: Singularity is very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, as being a tacit Reprimand of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of others; who fail not in their turn to call thoſe Singularities <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and they may really appear ſo thro' their Unuſualneſs.</p>
               <p>'TIS always to be remembred, that we are to conſult the World no farther than as to our outward Behaviour: nor does it pretend to teach us the Rules of Virtue, but only how to ſhun Ridicule, a thing on the other hand we ought not to be too much afraid of, leſt we make a Sacrifice of our Virtue, our Convenience and all. There is the more reaſon for this Caution that the World is made up of ſo many
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0039200600:231"/>
different Taſtes, that 'tis ſimply impoſſible to pleaſe all: This Man ſhall complain, that you uſe too much Ceremony with him; if you uſe leſs of it with another, he ſhall think you <hi>brutal</hi>; and perhaps the former Complainer would not have been ſo eaſy, if any part of it had been omitted. This is but one Inſtance: it is impoſſible to mention all the Treſpaſſes and Regulations in the Affair of Decency, and the Miſtakes People fall into by their injudicious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to <hi>pleaſe</hi>; very often miſtaking the Objects of their Civility and Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, as well as the right Proportion of the thing. If a Man ſhould be ſurly to his own Family, and his neareſt Friends, and obliging and frank with thoſe he only makes an Afternoon's Viſit to; this were no Argument either of his good Senſe or his good Humour, but would look like a vain Deſire of Applauſe from thoſe he has little to do with: and if a Woman ſhould fall into the ſame Affectation, it would be nothing to her praiſe. Husbands and Wives have certainly a Title to good Looks and good Words, as well as Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>THE World will be a good enough School to form our Behaviour in many little things, to tame our natural Wildneſs, to ſmooth our Roughneſs, and even to qualify our Civility, that it may not dwindle
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0039200600:232"/>
into formal Ceremony, or too ſoft Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance: all which muſt bring Ridicule upon us, and 'tis the proper Buſineſs of this School-Miſtreſs (for ſo the World may be likewiſe call'd) to prevent that Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>THE Severity of the School-Miſtreſs will hardly be complain'd of, when we conſider the Allowances that are given to gratify the ſtrongeſt Inclinations of the Heart. A Man is not found fault with for ſtriving to get as much Money as he can, or aſpiring after the higheſt Employments and Honours in the Commonwealth; he is rather blam'd if he omits any Opportunity of raiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or neglects any Pleaſure. All the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction the World gives, is to keep free of certain Blunders in our Conduct, and weak Appearances, which affect the outward Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, without any regard to Vice or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The neglect of that Inſtruction does expoſe us to the Severity of the World, which in different reſpects may be call'd tyrannical and gentle; and the higheſt Prudence is to know when to make it our Guide, and when to deſpiſe its Maxims.</p>

               <p>AS Creatures of the ſame Species have commonly a Pleaſure in herding and flocking together; the like Pleaſure is found among Mankind, with the Deſire of mutual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation added to it. Solitude and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation will not always ſupport us, nor will Company and our own Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation do it ſeparately; we muſt often have the Approbation of others, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to ourſelves. 'Tis true, there is one ſort of Pride, which will very much leſſen the Deſire of Approbation; that is, when a Perſon is throughly poſſeſt with an Opinion of his own Excellency. But this Pitch of Extravagance is very rare: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Degrees of it will be enough to ſlacken the toilſome Purſuit of Applauſe, nay, if one is hot in the purſuit of any other thing, he will mind the Judgment of the Publick ſo much the leſs, and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud</hi> himſelf, as the Miſer does when the People <hi>hiſs him.</hi>

                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0039200600:234"/>
BUT as any Inclination is ſeldom ſo ſtrong as to make one renounce all views of popular Applauſe, ſo the too eager Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of that Uncertainty, is called Vanity rather than Pride: Vanity denoting the emptineſs of the Thing, as well as the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Temper of the Perſon. And thus ſome have made a Diſtinction between Pride and Vanity, giving us an Idea of two different ſorts of Men, thoſe who content themſelves with their own Approbation, and thoſe who are uneaſy without the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others. But perhaps the firſt Temper is not only very rare, but impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in nature, and ſo the Difference is only in the greater and leſſer Degrees of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, or in the way that Pride diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers itſelf in different Perſons. Thoſe that are fond of outward ſhow, or of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an appearance, are called <hi>Vain</hi>; thoſe that value themſelves upon their inward Endowments, <hi>Proud:</hi> but both Parties value themſelves, and both Parties may be called <hi>Vain,</hi> as both are really <hi>Proud</hi>; ſome proud of their native Ornaments, others of borrowed ones: and the very proudeſt can hardly be ſuppoſed free from the Deſire of Eſteem from others. They are indeed freer from Oſtentation, and their Deſire of Eſteem is more conceal'd; but pure independent Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency is not a natural ſtate of Mind; and if the Notion ſhould enter the Thoughts
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0039200600:235"/>
of any created Being, it muſt argue the greateſt Diſorder of the Underſtanding that's conceivable.</p>
               <p>BY Self-conceit is meant a much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Diſorder, implying only an Opinion of one's own merit not well enough found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this ſtate of Mind is only charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with more or leſs Folly. But the ſimple Deſire of Approbation is neither chargeable with Folly nor Vice: for 'tis as natural to deſire the Approbation of others as their Friendſhip, tho' Friendſhip is the moſt delightful Poſſeſſion, and commonly draws the other after it: we always eſteem thoſe we love, tho' we don't always love thoſe we eſteem.</p>
               <p>THERE are other kinds of Pride which belong not ſo naturally to the preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſuch as the Deſire of Power or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Perſons of others, and the Deſire of ſubduing their Judgment. The latter of theſe is moſt found in ſpiritual Matters, tho' a deſire of temporal Power may ſometimes be at the bottom. The Deſire of a little Triumph in Converſation is leſs extravagant, but more common, and ariſes almoſt upon every Subject whether grave or frivolous. But this Obſervation may be made, that according to the ſeveral kinds of Pride in Man, in conjunction with their ſeveral Tempers and Humours,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0039200600:236"/>
ſome are more inclined to Company, others to Solitude. The Purſuers of Fame muſt expoſe themſelves to publick view, coſt what it will; the leſs Oſtentive are more diſpos'd to Solitude. Thoſe again who are remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably afraid of Contempt, will for that very reaſon prefer Solitude, thinking they make a good bargain <note n="*" place="bottom">Rochefoucault.</note>
                  <hi>to renounce all the Good that others might ſay of them, upon condition they would ſay no Ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Maxim (by the way) might infer ſome middle ſtate between Approbation and Reproach, which is not ſo conceivable; unleſs the <hi>ſaying nothing</hi> ſhould proceed from an abſolute ſuſpenſe of the Mind: but this is not uſual, moſt Minds being forward enough to pronounce Sentence one way or other, and moſt Actions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives being pretty evidently either worthy of Praiſe or Blame.</p>
               <p>THERE is likewiſe a certain Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt Approbation and Applauſe, the former being underſtood to be given by good Judges, and the latter by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Applauſe will never be deſired where there is Wiſdom, and the Deſire of Approbation is only Pride when it is courted for itſelf, without deſiring a virtuous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And again, tho' the Fondneſs for Reputation may be an Argument of Pride,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0039200600:237"/>
the Neglect of it will be no Argument of Humility, but of an abandon'd Character, or being without ſhame. But Man is not only under different Directions or Impulſes from his Pride, but alſo from his oppoſits Inclinations; theſe alſo varying according to different Circumſtances of Age or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: ſo that our Motions muſt be very uncertain and irregular, and ſometimes our Opinions are excited by our Inclinations, and ſometimes our Inclinations by our Opinions.</p>
               <p>THESE Reflections, and many more that will eaſily occur, may be of ſome uſe to diſcover the Foundation of Decency, as well as to ſhew wherein it conſiſts. If ſome things are naturally <hi>becoming,</hi> Men muſt be pleaſed to ſee them obſerved; and the Doer is pleaſed doubly, by his adhering to Nature, and his pleaſing others. There is Good-Humour and Complaiſance, as well as Vanity, in Mankind. But this very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance had need of Regulations, that it go not to an Exceſs; and, as things now ſtand, a little Pride muſt often come to the ſupport of weak Virtue. If it ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led only the ſupport of a Character, it may be granted that the Aim often goes no farther: but then the Character may be reckoned at leaſt among the Out-works for the Defence of Virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0039200600:238"/>
RELIGION and Good Manners ſeem to expreſs all the Obligations Men are under. Natural Affection and Humanity, no doubt, are Obligations too; but they are included in Religion, as all the Duties are that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our Neighbour. But by Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners People generally underſtand Morality, or Moral Virtue, which is reckon'd inferior to Religion, and yet is a higher thing than what is call'd Good Breeding or Decency; <q rend="inline">"which, tho' the leaſt of all Laws, is more obſerved than any."</q>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Obligations ſtanding in this Order, it may be thought ſtrange that the loweſt ſhould be ſo much minded, and the higheſt ſo little! All other Laws have a Sanction to enforce their Obſervance, Decency has not ſo much as the Name of a Law, and the Sanction of it is only Cenſure; and yet the Fear of incurring this imaginary Pain is ſometimes greater than the Fear of Hell. Many Perſons, I know, would take it very ill to have their Belief of a future State cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion; but let them examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſee how far their Belief affects their Conduct, and whether their Fears are not more awakened as to the temporal Confuſion than the eternal, and all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Torments they believe are join'd with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0039200600:239"/>
THIS Fear of Shame and Diſgrace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes not a little even to the Obſervance of temporal Laws: it ſometimes goes farther than the Fear of Death. And where the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the World makes a crime extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily diſgraceful, it is very rarely commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as Theft among Men of Faſhion. If the Opinion of the World ſhould happen to change, the taking a Bribe would be as little hear of among ſome Ranks, as the picking a Pocket.</p>
               <p>BUT as neither Opinion nor Cuſtom can alter the Nature of Things, there will ſtill be a Party (however ſmall) that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and blame according to Reaſon; and ſo Decency will be allowed all the Privileges it can juſtly pretend to, and no more.</p>
               <p>COU'D a Man be contented with the Approbation of this ſmall Party, he would find himſelf conſiderably at eaſe: good Judges are not only juſt, but mild, ſo far as the thing will bear, and are not ſevere upon every little Treſpaſs or Punctilio. The Multitude indeed (by whom are meant the cager Followers of Cuſtom) are very indulgent in ſome matters of Conſequence, but ſometimes they cannot forgive the leaſt Trifle. Again, the great Body of the People, as they are almoſt without the Sphere of Decency eſtabliſhed by Cuſtom,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0039200600:240"/>
which does not dazle them; ſo they ſee better in Matters of real Decency, and abhor thoſe Crimes which the higher Ranks overlook.</p>
               <p>IF this Diſtinction ſhould be quarrel'd, as if it were making two different Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, or two Claſſes of the Mob; it may be anſwer'd, the Diſtinction is not new, and only ſhews that the Difference between <note n="*" place="bottom">Seneca.</note>
                  <hi>fine</hi> Clothes and <hi>coarſe</hi> can add no weight to the Judgment of the Wearers. And certainly 'tis a great Point gain'd towards a Man's Quiet, when he knows who are his proper Judges, and is indifferent about the Opinion of others. This (if one could get at it) is not going too far in <hi>Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm.</hi> Nobody would chuſe to be on the Rack to their Lives end; and a Creature that pretends to Reaſon, had need alſo to conſider what Life is deſign'd for, as well as what the beſt means are to make it eaſy.</p>
               <p>NOW upon a very little Reflection a Man will find, that he has not been made to be a <hi>Mountebank,</hi> but to act a more ſolid part; to do what Good he can, and to endeavour <hi>heartily</hi> to acquire a Delight in all Virtues, in proportion to their value. And Delight, every body knows, makes a Facility in Practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0039200600:241"/>
BUT this is ſtill to be remembred, that tho' the Delight in Virtue is ſaid to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable; yet the Senſe of it, or the Faculty of reliſhing it, is brought with us into the World; as we bring the Faculty of Reaſon itſelf, which ripens by degrees, and all our Powers are improved or weaken'd by good or bad Management, to ſay nothing of the Foundation that's laid in this ſtate of trial for our future Happineſs or Unhappineſs.</p>
               <p>'TIS true, Decency and Virtue have different Provinces; and the former may be ſaid to lie only within the Verge of this Dream of Life, wherein our Fellow-Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers may indeed ſet up Tribunals to judge of our Behaviour, but we know all the harm theſe Judges can do us.</p>
               <p>As we diſcover our Pride therefore by affecting an univerſal Eſteem, and our Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice by the Subjection we put ourſelves under; ſo in both Inſtances we diſcover our Folly, the thing in the world we wou'd wiſh to diſcover leaſt. We can put a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Face on ſome of our Weakneſſes, and imagine other People will ſhew the like Favour; our Fear we can term <hi>Prudence,</hi> our Covetouſneſs <hi>good Management,</hi> and ſo of other Failings: but Folly is laugh'd at and hiſſed by every body; and when our own good Opinion forſakes us, 'tis natural to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0039200600:242"/>
conclude, that we are ridiculed by others: nay, ſometimes thro' the Diſorder of our Judgment we think we are more ridicul'd than we are, or that certain Practices and Omiſſions will draw more contempt upon us than poſſibly they can; and ſo we fall into the very thing we wou'd avoid, by our Apprehenſion of falling into it.</p>
               <p>THUS Mankind, by miſtaking their Judges and their Duties, are ſtill upon the Rack and in conſtant Slavery; unleſs we ſhould except a very few Emperors; to whom no Rules are preſcribed but their own Will. But tho' we do not know all that paſſes in their Breaſts, we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they have ſome Fear of Cenſure like other Mortals. Nor, if we turn our Eyes to the oppoſite and loweſt Rank, can we affirm that they have got over all <hi>human Regards:</hi> 'tis probable that even <hi>ſturdy Beggars</hi> are afraid of ſome Reproach among their own Gang.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER be of that, we are pretty ſure the greateſt Rakes among Gentlemen have ſome Qualms about their Reputation; and tho' they talk and write againſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as if they wiſhed it were out of the World, and probably they do bear it a Grudge, yet they cannot ſhake off its Yoke, and are as much Hypocrites (in another way) as thoſe who pretend to have a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0039200600:243"/>
for it; both Parties paying it a ſort of Homage, whether they will or not.</p>
               <p>DECENCY, it ſeems, will triumph over all Ranks and Characters, and will be a conſtant Diſcipline to Mankind. But our Pride and Ignorance make it a greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline than otherwiſe it would be. For if Virtue be agreeable to a Taſte that is not wholly vitiated, Decency will be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able too: it is not inconſiſtent with Virtue, but rather is inſeparable from it, as the Shadow from the Body.</p>
               <p>VIRTUOUS Perſons therefore will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Decency from the Principles of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (the Love of Order, and true Civility) as the Vicious will obſerve it from Self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: and ſo it may be look'd upon as a great Inſtrument for preſerving ſome Peace and good Order in the World; few Perſons being ſo thorowly virtuous as to need no reſtraints, and few ſo thorowly abandon'd as neither to be capable of Remorſe nor Shame.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS it would be expected after theſe little Speculations concerning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that ſome Inſtances ſhould be given of the Treſpaſſes againſt it. But as it would be but a diſagreeable Task, any Perſon of tolerable Senſe will eaſily know ſuch Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes when he ſees them; and 'tis no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to have the Head filled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0039200600:244"/>
Images. All Treſpaſſes againſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are certainly Treſpaſſes againſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, tho' the contrary Poſition does not always hold: but ſeveral things that are only look'd on (by ſome) as Breaches of Decency, are really Breaches of Virtue and even of Religion. <hi>If any Man among you ſeemeth to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his own Heart, this Man's Religion is vain</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">St. <hi>James.</hi>
                  </note>. But not to make the World worſe than it is, a great deal of the Humour of Detraction proceeds not ſo much either from Pride, or Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as from a meer Habit of idle talking; till at laſt the Head becomes a Regiſter of Traſh and Scandal, and the Itch of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating increaſes with the Itch of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If this Apology ſhould not be kindly received, I ſhould be content to know ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Source of the Errors in Converſation than either Vanity or Ill-Humour, or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Folly; and there is ſometimes a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of all the three.</p>
               <p>THE Inſtances of Indecency in common Converſation (which would make a very large Book) are not the only Treſpaſſes. We treſpaſs againſt Decency in moſt things we do for our pleaſure, and even for the ſupport of our Character: Tho' in things of this latter Claſs 'tis Cuſtom under the name of Decency that miſleads us; for if we are but told, <hi>that ſuch a thing is done</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0039200600:245"/>
                  <hi>or not done,</hi> we enquire no farther. But as we are not to torture ourſelves with the Fear of being ill ſpoke of, we muſt even ſhun too great a Squeamiſhneſs, or the Fear of doing ill. Where Religion and Virtue are ſilent, common Senſe muſt determine the beſt way it can.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Sex</hi> have their particular Decencies, both natural and artificial, which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with great exactneſs. <hi>Decent Pride</hi> is appropriated to them: and tho' it is but a poetical Expreſſion, both Sexes being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der equal Obligations as to Virtue, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der equal Reſtraints as to Vice, yet the Women have a right to value themſelves a little upon their native Charms and the outward Advantages of Fortune, that Men (who have more Ill-nature than they, and as much Vanity of another kind) may not look upon them as too eaſy a Conqueſt. Good Senſe and ſome Religion (to which Women are more inclinable than Men) will help to keep this Self-Eſteem of theirs within due bounds, that they may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their lovelieſt, and even brighteſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, Good-humour; nor appear without <hi>the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit.</hi> For it muſt not be forgot, that there is a difference between <hi>decent Pride</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> itſelf, and it ſeems to be this: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency is a certain Gracefulneſs in Actions; <hi>decent Pride</hi> is a Regard to Reputation, with
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0039200600:246"/>
ſome mixture of Self-Eſteem not too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable: and it were good upon ſome occaſions that even Men had a little more of this Quality, till a better Principle takes place. If Self-Intereſt could be wholly ſeparated from the regard to Reputation, it would immediately be of the number of the pure Virtues; and if a Man had any view of being uſeful to the World, the more Reputation he has, the more he is uſeful.</p>
               <p>PRIDE would get very little footing in the midſt of Applauſe and Approbation, if a Man knew himſelf well, and what he is in Soul and Body at his beſt. He would ſoon acknowledge the Truth of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Expreſſion, <hi>Pride was not made for Man.</hi> The ſame Knowledge would inform him, that Applauſe is a dangerous thing for a Mind ſo eaſily puffed up. And as the Knowledge of ourſelves, and the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World are ſubſervient to each other, ſo by this latter Knowledge we find out the Difficulty and the Emptineſs of that airy Conqueſt; and by ſeeing the Ridicule that others fall into, we are ſomewhat on our guard to ſhun it; the Fear of Shame being as natural to us, as the Fear of Pain: and Shame is truly a Pain of the Mind, as every one that has felt it will acknowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0039200600:247"/>
THOSE who alledge that Shame is only artificially work'd up in human Nature, may as well alledge, that any other Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo work'd up: the Fear of it indeed may be artificially excited in us, as the Fear of ſeveral things may be excited the ſame way: We may be afraid <hi>where no Fear is,</hi> as well as aſhamed where no Shame is; and we may be inſenſible both as to Fear and Shame, when we have moſt reaſon to be ſenſible of both, as the old Comedian has told us.</p>
               <p>ONE might eaſily be led into a Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon Shame (eſpecially from the words of the Text) deſigning only to make a few Reflections upon Decency; ſuch a Connexion there is between the two; and the different ſorts of Ridicule, or the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ridiculous Characters are ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to come into the Mind: but as ſuch Characters are without number, and are all Treſpaſſes againſt Decency, many of them are repreſented every day in Books of Wit and Humour, and even in Books of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; ſo that the World may be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the ways of ſhunning Deriſion. And indeed all the Authors have reaſon for touching upon that ſtring, ſince the Fear of Shame is ſo prevalent with Men: 'Tis a thing that ſtirs very early, for even Nurſes endeavour to ſhame their young ones into
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0039200600:248"/>
good Behaviour and Decency, before Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is awakened in them; and it often has a good Effect, beyond the Threats of whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
               <p>THIS Senſe of Shame is often a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Diſpoſition towards Virtue, and is a very agreeable Delicacy of Spirit. Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is Stupidity, 'tis the want of one kind of Senſe, or of ſomething implanted by the Author of Nature in rational Creatures. We ſee how carefully thoſe Decencies are obſerved, that relate to the Body, as if there was a Reſpect due even to it, and Men were conſcious of ſome Advantage in their outward Form: No Nation goes upon all four. The Body is not only covered, but adorned. 'Tis true, this may infer a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of Defect, and ſome natural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, which muſt be granted; but it is the part of Reaſon to ſupply and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify all Diſadvantages, ſo far as it can. We even obſerve numberleſs Decencies natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, without Art and Inſtruction, from a Senſe of what is beautiful as well as of what is unſeemly. If we hear ſometimes of poor doings, and great Degeneracy in human Nature, it needs give no more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize than when we ſee a good Tree ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train'd, or a piece of Ground over-run with Weeds. It happens on the other hand too often, that external Decencies are minded with an extraordinary Carefulneſs, when
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0039200600:249"/>
there are horrid Treſpaſſes committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Virtue.</p>
               <p>A few Hints or <hi>Items</hi> well remembred, will ſave a multitude of Illuſtrations, that might be made upon this Subject of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. What follows is not propoſed to have the Authority of Maxims, but is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd only to the Conſideration of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have not much leiſure to read large Treatiſes; and upon a very little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, a variety of Reflections will ſpring in their own Minds in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>THERE muſt be a Fund to work upon, in concurrence with good Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>MAN naturally loves Virtue and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: and when he is deceived, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an appearance of ſomething that's good.</p>
               <p>WE are often led by meer Imitation, and often ruined by it.</p>
               <p>DECENT, with moſt People, is but another word for <hi>Cuſtomary.</hi> Hence the interfering of Decency and Virtue.</p>
               <p>DECENCY in Opinions is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Truth: in Inclinations and Actions 'tis Virtue and Goodneſs. But the common Province of Decency goes no farther than
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0039200600:250"/>
the Circumſtances of Actions, or the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing them.</p>
               <p>WE often fall into Extravagances and Follies, thinking to avoid what is reckon'd Indecent, and the Contempt that follows upon it; but more frequently we fall into theſe Inconveniences from the Humour of Diſtinction and Superiority.</p>
               <p>THE Indecencies of Converſation ariſe from Vanity, Ill-humour, and a baſtard kind of Good-humour. This falſe Complaiſance appears much in the Cuſtom of Detraction: it goes on againſt the Abſent, becauſe 'tis ſuppos'd to be agreeable to the Preſent, who become the Abſent the next moment, and ſuffer in their turn.</p>
               <p>PROFESS'D Indecency of any kind is Inſolence. Vanity is commonly the firſt Inducement to fooliſh talking. Thus ſmutty Jeſts oftener ſhew the Oſtentation of Wit than the Inclination to Lewdneſs; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Expreſſions are no ſure Argument of Unbelief.</p>
               <p>AN Exceſs of talking of any kind is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom free from the ſame Vanity.</p>
               <p>MOROSENESS is the Effect of Pride, as if the Company was not worthy of our mixing with it. The Indecency lies in the ſullen Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0039200600:251"/>
INDECENCIES in Apparel are as much ſhunn'd as any. Herein Cuſtom triumphs eminently: 'tis the chief Point of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity among all Ranks and Parties.</p>
               <p>IN all other Articles of Expence, that which is neareſt the middle muſt be Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the preciſe Point not being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: the Extremes of <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low</hi> are either call'd Extravagant or Sordid.</p>
               <p>WE ſee of what uſe this inexplicable thing, Decency, is for regulating all our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Motions: it keeps our Pride itſelf in ſome order, tho' it be call'd its Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and if it does not reſtrain our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Averſions, it often hinders them from breaking out. It lulls our Spirits aſleep, and by turns rouſes them. In ſhort, Decency may be <hi>now</hi> reckon'd of ſuch ſervice in the Commonwealth, that without it the Judicatures both in Church and State wou'd have much more to do than they have; to ſay nothing of the Tranquillity it helps to preſerve in private Families.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>THE Diſputes upon this Subject have been very much increas'd (as it ſtill happens) by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Acceptations of the Terms, which ought regularly to have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted before entering upon the Merits or Demerits of the Thing. Some Men have exalted <hi>Self-Love</hi> ſo high, as to make it the Source of the greateſt Duties, while others have look'd upon it as the Sink of all Wickedneſs! And ſometimes its greateſt Advocates, when they are preſs'd with Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, declare plainly they meant no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but Self-Preſervation; which, if duly regulated, no body can have a good Reaſon to condemn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0039200600:254"/>
FROM this Obſcurity, and Contradiction, have ariſen new Diſputes concerning Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; ſome making very unfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reports of it, and others affirming it to be without fault. The former Party aſſert, <q rend="inline">"That a Man is not capable of the leaſt Act of common Honeſty, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Friendſhip, without a deliberate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his own Intereſt as the prevailing Motive."</q> And thus the ſelfiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which may be compared to <hi>the dead Fly in the Apothecary's Ointment,</hi> is ſet up as the only Wiſdom or true Rule of all Actions and Deſigns! This is alſo a falſe Account of Religion, if we ſuppoſe Man to have a higher End than himſelf, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Religion as the Duty we owe another Being, and a Being of ſuch Perfections as are only to be found in the Deity.</p>
               <p>THE latter Party maintain the Principle of Diſintereſtedneſs ſufficiently: but as they deny the Infirmity and Corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, their Doctrine labours under inſuperable Difficulties.</p>
               <p>THESE two Partys are diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to each other in their Schemes and Opinions, agreeing only in their Averſion to reveal'd Religion, which indeed would be an uſeleſs Thing if either of the Schemes was true: a Creature ſo highly exalted, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0039200600:255"/>
able to govern itſelf, needed no other Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and a Creature ſo very low, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all Liberty, muſt be incapable of any Degree of Virtue.</p>
               <p>THERE is a third ſort of Men, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Difference between Right and Wrong, and ſhew likewiſe a great Reſpect for the Chriſtian Religion; I ought to ſay farther, that I believe them to be ſincere: but at the ſame time they are ſo violent Advocates for <hi>Self-Love,</hi> or the intereſted Principle, as to ſpeak of the <hi>pure diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted</hi> Love of God in very unbecoming Terms.</p>
               <p>SINCE any Controverſy that may ariſe in this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> is chiefly with thoſe who own Chriſtianity, I ſhall ſay little in behalf ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of its Proofs or its Doctrine, both which have ſtood firm againſt the Attacks of more ſubtile Spirits than we have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; my principal Deſign being in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way to ſhew the beſt and the worſt of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> and in what ſenſe it is to be underſtood, before it can be ſet up ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the Principle of Vice or Virtue.</p>

               <p>CUSTOM, which determines the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of Words, has generally put a bad meaning upon <hi>Self-Love</hi>; ſo that a <hi>Self-Lover</hi> is reckoned the ſame with an intereſted unjuſt Perſon, whoſe Intereſt or Pleaſure (in whatever Form it appears to him) will be his conſtant Aim, without any regard to the Rules of Equity.</p>

                  <hi>Lovers of their own ſelves,</hi> no body doubts but that he ſpeaks of a very remarkable Degeneracy.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0039200600:257"/>
others who he thinks are not ſo privileged, and envying ſuch as are. Hence the Idea of ſpiritual Pride.</p>
               <p>CONFORMABLE to theſe Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and other Nations generally underſtand by it Pride and all other ill Qualities of the Mind; but Pride moſt frequently. <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> is every where a vile Character.</p>
               <p>AMONG the eaſieſt Acceptations of <hi>Self-Love</hi> is ſuch a Self-Complacency or Self-conceit, as is repreſented by the Fable of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and which is only conſidered as a Folly.: But it is accompany'd for the moſt part with Arrogance, and a Deſire of engroſſing all things. And thus <hi>Self-Love</hi> has become a current Term for Pride, (as was ſaid before) or another Word for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature in all its Tendencies: at the ſame time 'tis a ſofter Word, and ſo has been introduced by polite Perſons, when they had not a mind to ſhock delicate Ears.</p>
               <p>THERE is a maſterly Deſcription of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> ſuppos'd to be done by the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> as it now works in the Heart of Man: 'tis a ſmall Book, and very much known. He begins thus, <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Additions, No II.</note>Self-Love <hi>is the Love of one's ſelf, and of all things for the ſake of one's ſelf.</hi> After which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0039200600:258"/>
he proceeds to mention the Effects. <hi>It makes Men Idolaters of themſelves, and would make them the Tyrants of others, if Fortune gave them an Opportunity.</hi> This ſuppoſes the total Subverſion of our Duty, both to God and Man: we not only act as if we were independent of the Almighty, but we ſet up ourſelves to be worſhipped in his ſtead; and are not only careleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of our Neighbour's Intereſt, but make a Sacrifice of it, and him to our own. Such is the Modeſty of Self-Love!</p>
               <p>MEAN time, the firſt part of the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, <hi>Self-Love is the Love of one's Self,</hi> gives us but little Diſcovery; and the ſecond part of it is not quite ſo proper: for <hi>the Love of Things for our own Sake,</hi> implies only a Deſire of them, as being ſerviceable to us, the Love terminating upon ourſelves. And thus ſome have blunder'd, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Self-Love with the Love of Pleaſure, or any thing the Heart is ſet upon. And ſometimes <note n="*" place="bottom">Additions, No I.</note>Pleaſure, and Intereſt, and Happineſs are all jumbled together, and made convertible Terms for <hi>Self-Love</hi>; which is a greater Confuſion ſtill. But this Criticiſm has nothing to do with the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault</hi>'s Account of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> who ſeems only to have intended to give a Repreſentation of that Principle in its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Shapes and bad Conſequences. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0039200600:259"/>
he next conſiders it in <hi>its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſneſs, its Subtilty, its Refinements</hi>; and adds, <hi>that it is often inviſible to it ſelf: that it hatches and nouriſhes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Number of Inclinations and Averſions, ſome of which are ſo very monſtrous, that it cannot believe them to be its own Brood.</hi> He ſays, <hi>it is made up of Contradictions, and can act the moſt contrary Parts; proud and fawning. It changes its Purſuits of Glory, Riches and Pleaſure, according to our Complexion, and the Changes of our Age and our Condition: but it is equal to it, to have many Purſuits, or but one; for it can divide itſelf into many, or contract itſelf into one, as it has a mind.</hi> He gives a View of its Inconſtancy, both as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from <hi>the Inſufficiency of Things which pleaſe us, and our own natural Changeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> He ſhews its extreme Poſitiveneſs, <hi>which makes a Man do the moſt fantaſtical Things, and even ſuch as are hurtful to himſelf, for no other Reaſon but merely that he may gratify his own Will.</hi> And this gives the Idea of <hi>poſitive blind</hi> Self-Will; Inſtances of which are very frequent in Life. He concludes, <hi>that Self-Love is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Ranks, and in all Conditions: it lives every where, it lives upon every thing; nay, it lives upon nothing! It finds its account even in the moſt rigid Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hoping (it ſeems) to get the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sanctity in exchange. This,</hi> (ſays
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0039200600:260"/>
he) <hi>is a lively Repreſentation of Self-Love, the continual Agitation whereof may be compared to the reſtleſs ebbing and flowing of the Sea.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes uſe of the ſame Image<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah lvii. 20.</note>; <hi>the Wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe Waters caſt up Mire and Dirt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM that Deſcription of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> (abridged as it is) we may form an Idea of it, as of a bottomleſs Gulph, out of which iſſue thoſe three Rivers of <hi>Pride, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Senſuality</hi>; as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that proceeds out of the corrupt Heart of Man, but may be reduced to one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe impure Streams, or, as Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> calls them, <hi>thoſe Rivers of Fire.

Fall, and after it. He ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">Sect.

[<hi>rappor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant à Dieu.</hi>] Man in that State not only loved himſelf without Sin, but he could not lawfully have ceaſed to love himſelf. When Sin enter'd into Man, he loſt the firſt of thoſe Loves; and the Love of himſelf, having remain'd alone in that great Soul of his, which was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of infinite Love, this Self-Love ſpread itſelf, and overflow'd the vaſt Space which the Love of God had forſaken: and thus he loved himſelf alone, and all things for himſelf; or, in other Words, he loved himſelf infinitely."</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Suppoſition of the Fall makes the Injuſtice of <hi>Self-Love</hi> certainly no leſs than it was before, and the Folly of it infinitely greater. If Man was to love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when he was uncorrupted and intire, only with ſuch an inferiour and ſubordinate kind of Love as Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> repreſents, ſhall he love himſelf now in his Corruption and Miſery, with ſuch a ſupreme and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Love, as if he were the Deity itſelf?
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0039200600:262"/>
This is a thing that even ſome of the Deiſts exclaim againſt, as the higheſt Extravagance; and it is ſhocking to common Senſe, tho' Chriſtianity were out of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>WE ſee Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> does not pretend to account for the Fall of Man, but only tells by way of Hiſtory, <q rend="inline">"That <hi>when Sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,</hi> his Condition was ſo very much changed, that he is now overſpread, as with a loathſome Diſeaſe<note n="*" place="bottom">No III.</note>."</q> But what Idea can we have of Sin? 'Tis but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative thing: We can only conſider it as an Apoſtacy, or ſome perverſe State of Mind, which has brought ſuch Miſeries upon Man, and all things about him. And what is this Apoſtacy, but ſome Defection in our own favour, the Source of which ſeems to have been Pride? And Pride is but Self-Eſteem, forgetting the Original from whence all good things are derived, and ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing every day as at firſt: but it may now (according to the common Phraſe) ſee its Sin in its Puniſhment: We ourſelves, and whatever we may be ſaid to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with, being reduced to ſuch extreme Infirmity and Diſorder! The Charity alſo of the great Author may appear in changing the State of Things from what they were, that ſo Man might have wherewithal to be undeceived, both from within himſelf, and from the Defects of the inferiour Creation.</p>

               <p>THE ſame Divine Wiſdom, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo call'd <hi>Nature,</hi> has added to the Impulſe of Self-Preſervation, another Impulſe in every living Creature towards its Eaſe or its Delights. And tho' in rational Creatures we hear much of <hi>a Deſire of Happineſs,</hi> and they actually have it; yet it operates of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without Reflection, or any deliberate Project and Deſign. If this Deſire be call'd natural Good-Will to ourſelves, Self-Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0039200600:264"/>
or even Self-Love, there is no harm in any of the Terms, if we but allow of a Principle of Good-Will towards other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon their proper account, as well as upon our own; that is, if we allow of a Deſire of Good to them, as well as of Good to our ſelves. In both Caſes the Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or Deſire of Good operates firſt; Reaſon ſerving to direct us in the Choice of proper Objects, and the Means of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>IN rational Creatures, (when they act rationally) the Deſire of Happineſs is the ſame with the Deſire of Perfection. Here is meant the higheſt Happineſs. When a Man diſcovers the Dignity of his Nature, he immediately wiſhes to arrive at all the Excellency he is capable of: and his Good-Will to himſelf, far from being extinguiſhed, is put under new Regulations.</p>
               <p>THE Queſtion at preſent is not, how we come to diſcover our Dignity, whether by our own natural Light, or a ſupernatural? All the Deſign is to ſhew that the Deſire of Happineſs in general, was before that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and continues after it, independent of Reaſon; the due Exerciſe of which, would indeed inform us that our Happineſs muſt be founded in the diſintereſted Purſuit of Truth and Juſtice.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV. The Deſires of MAN, conſidered more particularly.</head>
               <p>WE may therefore conſider in Man, theſe ſeveral kinds of Deſire. 1. A Deſire of ſimple Exiſtence. 2. A Deſire of Eaſe or Indolence: 3. A more poſitive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Pleaſure, either for the Body or the Mind; and, 4. A Deſire of Perfection or true Happineſs, which is only to be found in the Love of the Sovereign Beauty and Goodneſs. The three firſt Deſires are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and can only be call'd criminal, in ſo far as Injuſtice or Vice enters into them: the fourth muſt have been natural to Man in his original State, tho' it is not ſo natural in the preſent; and therefore now appears to be rather a divine Deſire, than a natural: ſo rare and ſo languid is the Deſire of Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Nor, ſuppoſing it to be in the ſtrongeſt Degree, would it be virtuous; unleſs it were animated by the Love of Truth and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be remember'd, that the Idea of Love implies more than ſimple Deſire: it ſuppoſes ſome Acquaintance and Notion of the Object, which it eſteems, and with which it deſires to be united: 'tis a ſecret Attraction, and the Pleaſure or Charm is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0039200600:266"/>
derived from the Object. Whereas Deſire is here ſuppoſed to be only blind Appetite, in which the Underſtanding has no ſhare, and the Value of the Object is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. It muſt be remember'd too, that even Love, the more it is ſtruck with the Beauty of the Object, will ſtill act with leſs Reflection on itſelf, and ſtill have its own Intereſt leſs in view. This may be apply'd to Love in general, which is often call'd blind, as well as Deſire: but where the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is ſuppos'd worthy of the Affection, <hi>blind</hi> is too harſh an Epithet; ſince no more can be meant, but that the Heart is capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and, only if it be unreaſonably ſo, is the Love to be call'd blind or blinded.</p>
               <p>BESIDES the ſeveral Deſires above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, Nature has farther implanted in us, a Deſire of the Approbation of others, our own not being ſufficient to ſupport us; which ſeems to be founded on a tacit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that all Mankind have for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or a Conviction of the Dignity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature. With all which Deſires there is a Self-Complacency, almoſt conſtantly ſuppos'd to attend us, and to have been wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to reconcile us to our low State, and to ſupport us againſt the Contempt of others. But the Self-Complacency here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be without fault, is a quite different Thing from that which was ſpoke of in the foregoing Sections, as implying either Folly
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0039200600:267"/>
or Arrogance, or both: and the Deſire of Approbation is an additional Tye upon Men to obſerve the Rules of Humanity, and all good Order.</p>
               <p>NOW as the Gratification of all our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deſires (lawfully purſued) may be call'd our true Intereſt, ſo this Intereſt cannot properly be call'd <hi>Self-Love</hi>; becauſe a very great Degree of that Principle may be found in the Purſuit of Things altogether deſtructive. If it ſhall be ſaid, <q rend="inline">"That it is not a right <hi>Self-Love</hi> that makes Men purſue ſuch deſtructive Things,"</q> it may be ſaid juſt as well, <q rend="inline">"That it is not a right Pride, or a right Covetouſneſs that makes Men purſue them:"</q> which would not be a very ſignificant Way of ſpeaking.</p>

               <head>SECT. V. The two Principles of ACTION, or the oppoſite Sources of VIRTUE and VICE.</head>
               <p>IN rational Creatures there are but two Principles, or two Sources, to which all deliberate Actions are reducible, <hi>viz. Self-Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Diſintereſtedneſs.</hi> If we ſeek for the moral Good or Ill of an Action, the Virtue or Vice of it, we muſt have recourſe to one of theſe two Principles. What a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0039200600:268"/>
Man does merely for his own Ends, has no ſhare of Virtue in it: on the contrary, the ſole Motive of Intereſt, rather ſtains an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that's otherwiſe materially good. To uſe a plain Inſtance, if I do a Man a good Office, to receive in return either a good Office from him, or a good Character from the World, no body will reckon this a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. We may therefore conclude, <q rend="inline">"That the Virtue or Worth of an Action is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be rated by its Diſintereſtedneſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is not indeed in our power to put things always to that Touchſtone, and we may be impoſed upon by falſe Appearances: but we know well in the general, whence the Worth is derived, and fail not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Things both <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>worthleſs,</hi> when no Intereſt of our own can poſſibly determine us. Friendſhip has been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſacred Thing all the World over: Whence can it have that Character, but from the Diſintereſtedneſs conceiv'd to be in it? And however intereſted the common Friendſhips of the World may be, yet every Man in his particular Profeſſions thereof diſclaims any View to Intereſt; being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a Friendſhip founded upon that Bottom, is but mere Traffick and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
               <p>THIS ſhews the general Senſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as to the Speculation of the Thing,

from which we may conclude the Reality of it; and it is not eaſy to conceive how that can be good, which every body is aſham'd to own.

                  <hi>Arrian</hi> upon <hi>Epictetus.</hi> He makes Friendſhip as uncertain as the Agreement among Children or little Dogs, who play together very cordially till ſome Bone of

               <p>THE ſame Philoſopher ſays farther, that <q rend="inline">"if Men take it in their heads, that the Gods are oppoſite to their Intereſt, they curſe them and overthrow their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars."</q> But his Deſign ſeems to be far from advancing the intereſted Principle, or the Byaſs towards ourſelves: He only ſhews how this Selfiſhneſs is ſo rooted in our Nature, that if we ſhall make a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between Intereſt and Virtue, we ſhall of courſe run to the ſide where we think our Profit lies: for this, he ſays, is dearer to us than all things; this is our Father, our Brother, our Country, our God. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> therefore, like the reſt of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> applies himſelf chiefly to direct the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; thinking if it was rightly inform'd, all the Work was done: but it is eaſier to make the Underſtanding ſee what is right,

               <head>SECT. VII. NATURAL LOVE conſidered under different Denominations.</head>
               <p>AS all Love implies both a Deſire of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the beloved Object, and a Delight in it after it is obtain'd; Self-Love in the firſt of theſe Views is Nonſenſe, and in the ſecond, 'tis the next thing to Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: nay, if the Complacency exceed the due Bounds, no Deluſion can be greater. 'Tis ſilly and fooliſh in the eye of the World.</p>
               <p>BUT there are three ſorts of Love, all granted to be natural, and even reaſonable; our Love to our Children, our Love to the Sex, and our Love to our Friends. If any of theſe Loves is right, or what it ought to be, <hi>Self-Love</hi> is wholly out of doors: at leaſt, the more perfect they are, it has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably the leſs place. A Father loves his Children by a happy Inſtinct (or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be call'd) without a View either of Profit or Pleaſure from them; for, as <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> ſays, we wiſh them to be happy after we are gone. The Pleaſure that may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon loving, is by no means the Cauſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0039200600:276"/>
of the Love. Nature has wiſely and kindly deſign'd that every Man ſhould take care of his own Children in the firſt place: the Care and Affection of Mothers is yet more remarkable: and what Tenderneſs is there obſerved, even in Nurſes! The Love of Children to their Parents, not being ſo much determin'd by Inſtinct, has been ſometimes call'd Piety.</p>
               <p>AS to the Inſtinct by which Parents are ſaid to love their Children, a <hi>burleſque</hi> Queſtion has been ask'd, <hi>viz.</hi> If this Love be an Inſtinct free of Selfiſhneſs, whence is it, that they feel that Inſtinct for other People's Children, when they believe them to be their own; and on the contrary, feel no ſuch Inſtinct for their own, when by Accident they are ignorant of the Relation? If a ſerious Anſwer was to be given, this perhaps might be it, That the Queſtion makes neither for Selfiſhneſs nor againſt it, and that in ſuch Caſes, Nature is hoodwink'd; but ſtill the End is obtain'd, which is the caring for the young helpleſs Creatures.</p>
               <p>THE Love to the Sex is a more delicate Article. Every body knows what the Deſire of continuing their own Species leads them to: this is hardly to be call'd <hi>Love</hi>; and if any will call it <hi>Self-Love,</hi> they muſt allow other Animals the ſame <hi>cool, deliberate</hi> Motives of proceeding. 'Tis plain, that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0039200600:277"/>
when a Man is heartily in love, all Self-Conſiderations (Proviſions and Settlements) muſt yield; and the Lover will purſue his Aim, unleſs an extraordinary Principle of Juſtice, or Regard for the Perſon, make him lay it aſide. And this too is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for Love, that the Mind is firſt engaged by the Qualities of the Woman: If Fancy now and then gives the Object a Value, which in reality it has not, this is ſtill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than <hi>Self-Love</hi>; the Man is <hi>taken:</hi> and there ariſes not only a Deſire of poſſeſſing, but he feels a Tenderneſs as a Parent does for a Child; and for proof of this we may appeal to <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>LOVE then is a Concurrence of Ardor, Reſpect, and Tenderneſs. But ſome People ſeem hardly to have a right Notion of any ſort of <hi>Love,</hi> when they ſuppoſe we muſt ſtill be reaſoning and reflecting in it, with a View to our own Intereſt. An old Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt ſpeaks more Senſe upon the Love he treats of:<q>

AND 'tis remarkable that <hi>Lucretius</hi>'s Metaphor here agrees with the modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of Gravitation. And indeed St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks of Love in general, as a Weight or Force by which we are carry'd: <hi>Amor meus, pondus meum,</hi> &amp;c. But it ſeems the Love of our Philoſophers ſits very light upon them: they think they may put it in their Pocket, like their Gloves.</p>
               <p>THE Love that enters into Friendſhip, is only free of that Ardor which tends to the Sex, but is accompany'd with no leſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and little leſs Tenderneſs, ſave what the Weakneſs or Delicacy of the Sex calls for at the hands of the ſtronger. But the Power of Love among Friends is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, and remarkably expreſs'd in theſe Words of <hi>Moſes, If the Wife of thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, or thy Friend whom thou loveſt as thine own Soul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>'TIS evident now, that wherever Love enters, the Delight is from the Object, not from <hi>Self:</hi> the Perſon is delighted, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but the Pleaſure is not from himſelf; ſince he receives it from ſomewhat elſe. If they ſay he ſtill loves the Object from Self-Intereſt, or his Intereſt is the Cauſe of his Love, this is contrary to Nature: and as <hi>Horace</hi> ſeems to reject the Suppoſition in the Caſe of Friendſhip, <hi>Cicero</hi> is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0039200600:279"/>
and full upon it. <note n="*" place="bottom">No. XII.</note>He ſhews excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, <q rend="inline">"That Love is the Principle and Motive which engages us in Friendſhip: that Intereſt or Profit may be made even by a Friendſhip which is but acted; but in true Friendſhip all is for the ſake of the Friend, all is free, genuine, and real. Therefore (adds he) Love appears to be founded on Nature, and not on our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and Occaſions; on a certain Reliſh and Bent of the Soul, (<hi>applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Animi</hi>) rather than any Thoughts of reaping Profit. That tho' Intereſt may attend Friendſhip, yet it is not the Aim of it. But (he ſays) moſt People chuſe their Friends, as they do their Cattle, to make a Gain of them; and therefore have no Experience of that moſt beautiful and natural Friendſhip, by which we love a Friend for himſelf, and cultivate Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for its own Value. That, in ſhort, as we love ourſelves without a View to any Reward at our own hands, we ought to love our Friend after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for to love one, is to cheriſh him for his own ſake, without any Regard to our own Indigence or Intereſt."</q> Much more will be found to this purpoſe, in that excellent little Treatiſe upon Friendſhip. He ſuppoſes all along that Virtue or perſonal Worth is to be the Cement of Friendſhip, and the only thing that can render it dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and he reckons the Charms of Virtue
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0039200600:280"/>
ſo great, that we cannot but love it, even in thoſe we have never ſeen, and can never hope to ſee, and from whom 'tis impoſſible we can receive any Advantage.</p>
               <p>THE only Evaſion ſome have fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, that we love for the Pleaſure we find in loving; and ſo 'tis ſtill (ſay they) Self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt at the bottom. But this, as it would take away the Diſtinction of Vice and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and imply a fatal Neceſſity, without leaving any thing to Reaſon; ſo it is plainly a miſtaking the Effect for the Cauſe: we are attracted firſt, and ſeiz'd on by the Object, without Deſign upon either ſide; unleſs on ſome Occaſions, where certain agreeable intelligent Objects are ſaid to lay Traps for Lovers, by ſhewing their own Charms: but then this Forwardneſs of appearing, which the Sex is ſometimes accus'd of, proceeds more from Curioſity and a Deſire of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, than of exciting Love, or even of drawing common Admirers. But this is a Speculation foreign from the Purpoſe: whatever be in it, the natural Attraction, whether Love or Friendſhip, is accompany'd with a certain Sweetneſs in which we are but paſſive, and can challenge nothing of it as our own Contrivance. Pleaſure is the Reſult of Friendſhip, not the Inducement to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0039200600:281"/>
NOW if the Conſtitution of our Nature is ſuch, that Pleaſure is inſeparable from loving our Friends, and doing them friendly Offices, this is the Contrivance of our Maker, and we cannot alter our Frame: nor have we any reaſon to wiſh it altered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Maker ſeems thereby to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd that Self Love ſhould be ſwallow'd up by a more generous Principle, in which our Nature finds its account, without laying a Plot for it. And as Generoſity conſiſts in giving, not in receiving, our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>that to give is more bleſſed.</hi> At this rate one would think Friendſhip ſhould not be ſuch a Rarity, ſince ſo much Pleaſure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it: But let <hi>Self</hi> anſwer for that. 'Tis enough for us to have the agreeable Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our Nature is capable of a finer Caſt; and they who would reſolve every thing into ſordid Intereſt, do only argue from the Abuſe of our Faculties, without a right Knowledge of the natural Uſe of them.</p>

               <head>SECT. VIII. Of other Engagements of the AFFECTION.</head>
               <p>BESIDE the three kinds of Love mention'd in the laſt Section, there are other things more properly call'd At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments than Love; ſuch as the Concern about one's Family, ſeparate from the Love to Children, and the lawful Concern we ought to have for our Poſterity and Kindred, which lies in the Deſire of having Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, and keeping up a mere Name. We ſhall hardly diſcover a Foundation for this Love in Nature, unleſs it be ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an Abhorrence of Extinction, or from an Anxiety that at leaſt a <hi>Sound</hi> ſhould remain after us to keep us from being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got. Pride will affect that this <hi>Name</hi> ſhould be highly regarded, becauſe of its ſeeming Relation to our Perſons; and ſo we wiſh our Repreſentatives to be Rich and Potent, not ſo much for their Conveniency, as our own Glory.</p>
               <p>TO this ſort of Love, the Love of our Country is frequently ſacrificed. But there is a nearer kind of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> which gets the better even of it: for we ſee good Eſtates <hi>play'd away,</hi> or otherwiſe ſquander'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Humour of the Proprietors.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0039200600:283"/>
And theſe will be call'd no extraordinary Diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>THE Love of our Country has more of Nature in it than the former, as if it was an Inſtinct planted by the great Ruler of the Earth, that all the habitable Parts of it might be inhabited with Contentment, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the utmoſt, without wandering to finer Climates, and diſlodging other People: and we ſee how alluring the <hi>native Soil</hi> has been in all Ages. But the Love of our Country farther implies (and with greater Reaſon) a peculiar Affection and Concern for the Society wherein Providence hath placed us; as if we look'd upon it as the Houſhold we belong to, and which we are therefore chiefly to care for, (the general Law of Humanity always obſerved) as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its moſt immediate and proper Members. However, if that kind of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> which aims no farther than the preſent Gratification of the Perſon, gets the better of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Family; 'tis no wonder the Concern for the Country is ſo much forgot, and look'd upon as an old-faſhion'd <hi>ſimple</hi> Thing. The wife ſelf-loving Man has no Country, no Family, no Friends; but where he can eat beſt, or make the greateſt Figure, there he lives.</p>
               <p>THERE is a Love which had almoſt been paſs'd over, <hi>viz.</hi> Party-Love. It owes its
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0039200600:284"/>
riſe to <hi>Self-Love</hi> plainly enough, whether it be conſidered as an accidental Agreement of Opinions, or a Combination of Intereſts and Deſigns, without any Cement of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or Regard to Truth. And tho' we ſee this Attachment to Party ſometimes produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſtrange Offices of Friendſhip; yet it muſt be a very ambulatory Affair, according to the various Changes of our Situation or our Humour.</p>
               <p>THE ſhort Concluſion may be this, that Friendſhip is the Soul of all Relations, and the Soul of it is Diſintereſtedneſs.</p>

               <head>SECT. IX. The Meaning of Diſintereſtedneſs. Two Sources of NATURAL VIRTUE.</head>
               <p>PERHAPS it will be thought ſtrange that Diſintereſtedneſs, being but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative ſort of Term, implying only an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt or unſelfiſh State of Mind, ſhould yet be mention'd as a poſitive Quality, and call'd the Soul of Friendſhip. To anſwer ſuch People in their own way, it may be maintain'd that Diſintereſtedneſs is really a poſitive Term, as well as a poſitive Quality: for Intereſtedneſs is but the Negation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and Diſintereſtedneſs is the taking away that Negation: an intereſted Perſon is generally taken for an unjuſt Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0039200600:285"/>
BUT not to dwell upon Words: if Man was originally upright and uncorrupt, by the Removal of the oppoſite Qualities, he is reinſtated in his primitive Integrity; ſo that an uncorrupt Man is the ſame with an upright Man, and Diſintereſtedneſs but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Term for Uprightneſs. This way of ſpeaking therefore, when the Matter is well conſider'd, will paſs both with Chriſtians and Deiſts; for both Parties ſuppoſe Man to be originally upright, the latter only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his Defection from that State. And moſt Chriſtians, tho' they acknowledge the ſad Effects of the Fall, yet do not deny that there remains ſome Senſe of Equity, and ſome Fund of Good-Nature.</p>
               <p>THERE ſeems to be a natural Love of Juſtice and Order, as there is of Proportion and Harmony. We are pleas'd with a fine Character, as well as with a fine Picture, or fine Muſick. 'Tis true, the Heart is properly call'd the Seat of Love: but the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding has its Objects of Pleaſure too, and what pleaſes is loved. The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding not only ſees, but it <hi>approves,</hi> and Approbation implies Delight. Let us ſay plainly, every Man has a Senſe of Equity and fair Dealing, whatever Stretch we may make in our own favour; and every Man is well perſuaded of the Difference between Right and Wrong, independent of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0039200600:286"/>
and Example. As in things relating to the external Senſes, no Man can be taught to <hi>ſee</hi> or taſte; ſo no Man can furniſh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Senſe or Reliſh of Virtue: all that teaching can do in this Caſe, is to lay things before the Mind in ſuch a way as it may perceive either the Beauty, or the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of them, by its own native Force. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, no doubt, is of great importance, as it helps to cultivate thoſe innate Powers of the Soul, that <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Vis inſita,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> calls it: but that's another Affair.</p>
               <p>TO return, a Man <hi>feels</hi> when the Rules of Equity are broke to his own prejudice, and he <hi>ſees</hi> when they are broke to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Neighbour, if the Injury is done by a third Perſon; for he does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſee it when it is done by himſelf. Thus the Prophet accoſted <hi>David</hi> under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Ewe-Lamb, which made him ſee his Error immediately, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was convicted.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> himſelf does not deny there is ſuch a thing as <note n="†" place="bottom">Leviath. Chap. XI.</note>
                  <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong</hi>; he only ſays, <q rend="inline">"the Doctrine thereof is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſputed both by the Pen and Sword; whereas the Doctrine of Lines and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures is not ſo."</q>—And he gives a very good Reaſon for it juſt after. <q rend="inline">"Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

in this Subject Men care not what be Truth, as being a thing that croſſes no Man's Ambition, Profit, or Luſt."</q> A <hi>Frenchman</hi> would have put <hi>l'Amour propre</hi> for all: but the Principle ſtill holds good, that Truth, and Juſtice, and Virtue, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally agreeable to the Mind, when it is free of Byaſſes in its own favour: and the Character of an honeſt Man will be as lovely as that of a Scoundrel will be hateful; which it ſometimes happens to be even among ſuch Folks themſelves.</p>
               <p>THIS Senſe or Reliſh of Virtue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any View to Self-Intereſt, is one Source of moral Actions; tho' often very unable to produce them, as was obſerved before, Sect. VI. To which this may be added, that our Inclinations not only hinder us from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing what our Reaſon <hi>ſees to be good</hi>; but they confuſe and darken it in the firſt inſtance, making it often take the <hi>Ill</hi> for the <hi>Good.</hi> But we are here ſuppoſing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or the underſtanding Faculty to be free of any Influence from the Inclinations, in which caſe it ſees and judges of things within its Sphere diſtinctly enough; and ſo may be call'd one Source of diſintereſted Actions or human Virtues.</p>
               <p>WE may obſerve farther, that beſide that Reliſh or Approbation which the Mind gives to Truth, either after a Proceſs of Reaſoning,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0039200600:288"/>
or a more inſtantaneous Perception, there is ſtill in Man, fallen as he is; a Fund of Compaſſion or Tenderneſs, operating in a more warm and feeling manner, without any help of Reflection. And this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Source of diſintereſted Actions, ſeated in the Heart (as the former is in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) which yet being but a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Soul, a Man is no more to value himſelf upon it, than upon bodily Health.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS Benignity had been a fitter Word than Compaſſion, to expreſs that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Temper which prompts Men <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to do good to others: but Compaſſion came firſt up, and in the preſent diſtreſs'd State of things, every Man is ſome way or other an Object of it; ſo it may be taken for a general Inclination to relieve and aſſiſt. However, Benignity has a more extenſive Signification, not only importing Pity for the Afflicted, but a Deſire to ſee every body happy, and an Endeavour to make them ſo: and ſuch a Temper muſt extend to the whole ſenſible Creation. <hi>The juſt Man is merciful to his Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHOEVER then has any thing of this compaſſionate Temper in him, (as none but a Devil is ſuppos'd to be wholly void of it) ought to cheriſh it carefully: for 'tis a ſurer and a more fertile Principle of good Actions
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0039200600:289"/>
than that wherein the Underſtanding is only engaged. Moſt Men can <hi>love</hi> better than they can <hi>reaſon:</hi> and thus they are to blame who talk of Pity as a contemptible Thing; as <hi>Seneca</hi> call'd it the <hi>Defect</hi> of little Minds: but this great Man was carried away by a falſe Philoſophy, which did not allow what was due to the Affections, and would needs ſet up for an unnatural ſtiff Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that was good for nothing, even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be free from Grimace. Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence generally implies a Warmneſs of Heart, and care ſhould be taken that be not too <hi>cool</hi>; otherwiſe it degenerates into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence.</p>
               <p>NO doubt the warm Temper ought to be regulated by Diſcretion. A Judge, for inſtance, is not to be prevail'd on by more Tenderneſs for one Party, than the other; but muſt give the Subject in diſpute to the Perſon whoſe Right is cleareſt, tho' the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be more neceſſitous: and Merit is not in the queſtion neither. Again, in giving charitable Aſſiſtance, a Man is not to ſtrip himſelf in favour of the firſt Object he meets; but to proportion his Charity ſo as none may juſtly complain for want of a Share, and <hi>that Mercy may agree with Judgment.</hi> As to our reſerving for our own Occaſions, <hi>Self-Love</hi> will readily take care of that.</p>

               <head>SECT. X. Some Acceptations of CONSCIENCE.</head>
               <p>CONSCIENCE is either the Senſe of Equity in general, or the Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our adhering to it; which is ſuppos'd to carry its Reward along with it, as was ſaid in an old elegant Speech.<q>
                     <l>—&amp; Mens ſibi conſcia recti.</l>
                     <bibl>VIRG.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>AND a good Conſcience is call'd in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ, <hi>a continual Feaſt.</hi> If, on the contrary, we are conſcious that we have done wrong, or departed from Equity, this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection carries a Pain along with it, as the former carried a Pleaſure: and all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we can give of thoſe different Effects upon our Minds, is, that ſuch is the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things. St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us very plainly, that this Operation of the Mind has been uniform in all Ages of the World: <hi>When</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. ii.</note>
                  <hi>the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law; theſe having not the Law, are a Law to themſelves: which ſhews the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0039200600:291"/>
                  <hi>their Thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing,</hi> &amp;c. He ſays in another place, <hi>He had kept a Conſcience void of Offence towards God and towards Men.</hi> So that Conſcience may be conſider'd as one of the Powers or Faculties of the Mind, like an Ear for Muſick; with this difference, that ſome few Perſons have got no Ear, but no Man was ever without ſome Conſcience. The Taſte indeed may be corrupted, and ſo it fares with Conſcience.</p>
               <p>THIS View of Conſcience, as a natural Reliſh of moral Rectitude, and not <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> gives that Definition in his <hi>Eſſay on Human Underſtanding:</hi> and arguing againſt innate Principles, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"If Conſcience be a Proof of innate Principles, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries may be innate Principles; ſince ſome Men with the ſame Bent of Conſcience proſecute what others avoid."</q> But this Argument wou'd ſeem to ſtrike moſt againſt Virtue, as it ſeems to take away the Difference of Right and Wrong, or to render every thing ſo arbitrary and uncertain, that an Appeal could not be made to the common Senſe of Mankind in no Caſe whatſoever. But Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> cannot be ſuſpected to have had ſo bad an Intention: the Regard he expreſs'd for the Chriſtian Religion, as well as moral Virtue, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to clear him from ſuch an Imputation. 'Tis remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able too, that ſome profeſt Deiſts not only ſet up for the <hi>moral Senſe,</hi> but alſo acknowledge the innate Principles, which they call (after <hi>Epictetus</hi>) Anticipations, or previous Notices of the Mind.</note>
                  <hi>merely our own Opinion or Judgment of the moral Rectitude or Pravity of our own Actions,</hi> (as an ingenious Author defin'd it) will help to ſolve ſome Difficulties ariſing from the different Opinions of Men, (particularly Chriſtians) and their mutual Perſecutions; each Party really thinking themſelves in the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0039200600:292"/>
right. For it is to be obſerved, that theſe Differences are chiefly in Matters of Belief, and concerning the Interpretation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Doctrines, and that all Parties are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs agreed in the Principles of Juſtice and natural Equity. For inſtance, every one's Conſcience declares to him, that God is to be honoured in the moſt perfect Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: ſo that the Diſpute comes only to be, what is the moſt perfect Manner? As to which, (tho' Men muſt neceſſarily be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, ſo long as they differ in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of what has been reveal'd, or do not all equally agree upon the things that are to be received as Revelation) their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences (if they would hearken to them) would tell them that they ought to love one another, notwithſtanding any ſuch Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Thinking. But Hurry, Prepoſſeſſion, and Intereſt, darken the Underſtanding; making People take human Inventions for the Commands of God, or leſs earneſt to obſerve <hi>the weightier things of the Law,</hi> than the moſt inconſiderable Ceremonies. But this Confuſion of the Judgment does not infer that we have no ſuch Faculty, ſince it might be as reaſonably ſaid we have no Sight, becauſe ſometimes we do not ſee clearly. Nor is Chriſtianity to be charged with the Perſecutions among the different Sects and Parties, which its Enemies make a handle of in their Arguments againſt it: for Religion is commonly but a Pretence for
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0039200600:293"/>
ſuch Severities, the Quarrel rather riſing from Ambition, or Covetouſneſs, or both. And if blind Zeal or Fury, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mixture (which is even very rare) ſhould really be the Cauſe of the Severities, what more could the Founder of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion do, to inform Men's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, than by making their Love to one another, the principal Mark of being <hi>his Diſciples?</hi> If People will call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians (as each Party call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the only Chriſtians) and yet retain their Pride and Ill-Humour, and all the Vices of Nature, is Chriſtianity juſtly to be blam'd for that? They who thus blame it, as they are no leſs corrupt than the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are alſo guilty of a manifeſt piece of unfair Dealing; ſince any body that can read, may ſee what the Goſpel requires, and what it forbids.</p>
               <p>THE ſame View of Conſcience, as a natural Senſe of Equity, may help to ſettle the Debate about <hi>innate Ideas,</hi> which is not now ſo high as it was ſome Years ago: for it needs not be aſſerted, that we came into the World with the Ideas of Virtue, or Dictates of Morality, no more than with the Ideas of Squares and Triangles, and their ſeveral Properties. 'Tis enough that the Mind ripens as to its Comprehenſion of Truths both <hi>geometrical</hi> and <hi>moral:</hi> and whatever may be call'd <hi>Science</hi> in either, is
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0039200600:294"/>
only as it were an Evolution of ſome firſt Principles which Mankind are agreed upon; and ſo in Matters of Right and Wrong there lies an Appeal to the moral or internal Senſe, as in mathematical Demonſtrations there lies an Appeal to the external.</p>
               <p>IT was very agreeable to find that Sir <hi>Matthew Hale</hi> had aſſerted both <hi>the moral Senſe,</hi> and the moral Dictates, in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on our Saviour's Precept of <hi>doing as we would be done to.</hi> Here are a few of his Words: <q rend="inline">"As <note n="*" place="bottom">Contemplat.

often attributes to himſelf ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as render the very ſame Action done by him to another, to be juſt and righteous; when the very ſame Action done by another to him, ſeems to be unjuſt."</q> He therefore propoſes a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Perſons, which would put the Matter in a quite different Light: ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes moſt ingeniouſly, <q rend="inline">"The truth is, this Precept doth diſcharge <hi>Self-Love</hi> from having to do in this Buſineſs of moral Righteouſneſs or Charity; or at leaſt puts it in that Condition, by Tranſpoſition of the Perſons, that it ſpeaks as much for <hi>Gaius</hi> as it doth for <hi>Titius,</hi> when <hi>Titius</hi> ſuſtains the Perſon of <hi>Gaius</hi>; and ſo <hi>Self-Love</hi> becomes equally an Advocate for <hi>Titius</hi> and againſt him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Saviour has in a manner propos'd ſuch a Tranſpoſition of Perſons in that ſame glorious Precept, when he ſays, <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> And he has made the Command univerſal and abſolute, without any prudential Limitations which <hi>Self-Love</hi> would be too ready to ſuggeſt. But the ſame natural Reaſon which ſees the Fitneſs of the Command, ſees alſo where the Tranſpoſition is to take place; and that the Precept is not deſign'd to defeat Order and Government among Men: as a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0039200600:296"/>
Parent is not to abſtain from correcting a Child, nor a Judge from puniſhing a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal: ſuch Power, being given for the Good of others, muſt be exerciſed accordingly, and is ſometimes exerciſed with grief.</p>
               <p>A world of things might be ſaid about Conſcience, were it not for fear of being too intricate or too obvious. But 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that the ſame thing which acts within us ſometimes as a Judge, acts at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times as an Accuſer, and even as an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner: and hence the uſual Expreſſion of <hi>the Laſhes of Conſcience.</hi> Nor is it any Argument that People have no Conſcience, becauſe they do not always feel thoſe Laſhes, nor are troubled with any Remorſe. For, not to ſay that they ſometimes feel more than they are willing to own, they are under the power of another Principle (Self-Love) which hinders them from ſeeing that they have done wrong, or may at firſt puſh them on to commit it, contrary to their plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. 'Tis this Liberty they take of doing what they know they ſhould not, that makes it be ſaid they have no Conſcience, or, which is the ſame thing, a large Conſcience: both Expreſſions importing that they ſtick at nothing.</p>
               <p>IT is not poſſible to account for the Difference of Souls in the point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: ſome have it of a very delicate
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0039200600:297"/>
Senſe, others of a very dull one. And this Difference would ſeem to be in their very Nature, like the Difference of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion or any thing elſe. Why the ſame Perſon has this Senſe quicker and duller at different times, is another Secret, but the thing is certain in fact: for the ſame Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will prevail at one time, that would have no force at another.</p>
               <p>A ſcrupulous Conſcience implies a Defect in the Underſtanding, and is a-kin to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Bigotry; with this difference, that theſe two (which differ very little) often prompt Men to do extravagant Things: whereas Scrupuloſity reſtrains them from doing what may be very reaſonable.</p>
               <p>BUT it is not always Scrupuloſity to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the current Practice of the Times, the Multitude being an ill Guide; and bare Example ſtrong enough to carry People away, even when neither Intereſt nor Pleaſure ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite. But this one Obſervation may be made, that whatever may contribute to raiſe Scruples, Intereſt is very apt in moſt Caſes to remove them.</p>

               <head>SECT. XI. The REALITY of VIRTUE.</head>
               <p>IF there is ſuch a thing in Man as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, there muſt alſo be ſuch a thing as Virtue, tho' this is as hard to define as the former: but the Exiſtence of both is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable from the Diſtinction of Right and Wrong, and ſo Virtue may be conſidered as the adhering to what is right, the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of which the Conſcience was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of before. Nor does it ſtrike at the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of Virtue, that it is ſometimes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as <note n="*" place="bottom">No VI.</note>an abſtracted Notion of the Mind; for all Qualities are nothing more, when they are conſidered ſeparately from any particular Subject; and Men ſpeak of ſuch Qualities that fall under the outward Senſes, as well as of thoſe moral Qualities affecting the Mind; as they ſpeak of <hi>Streightneſs,</hi> both in Lines and Actions. What is there more common than to talk of <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>bitter,</hi> without joining theſe Words to any particular thing taſted, or any other way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd?</p>
               <p>THIS Pedantry ſeem'd the more allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that ſome Men have call'd Virtue, a Chimaera, a Phantom, and at beſt an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0039200600:299"/>
thing: but honeſt People are at no loſs, when they hear of a virtuous Action, to know whence the Virtue of it proceeds, and they call both Actions and Perſons <hi>good</hi> without heſitation; ſo that Virtue and Goodneſs often paſs for the ſame thing, and no Confuſion enſues. Only it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that the Idea of Goodneſs is leſs reſtricted than that of Virtue, which is chiefly applicable to rational Agents (call'd alſo moral Agents) and their Actions and Intentions.</p>
               <p>AS every body allows that Goodneſs is the Object of Love, ſo Virtue muſt be the Object of it too. Yet there is a ſort of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, which, if it took place, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the very Being of Virtue: and that is, when People affirm, <q rend="inline">"That no Man can love any thing but under the Notion of Good with reſpect to himſelf."</q> But this in the firſt place is contrary to Experience, ſince we love many things under the Notion of Good with reſpect to others, with whom we have not the leaſt Connection, and therefore cannot be ſaid to love thoſe things with reſpect to ourſelves. In the ſecond place, by that reaſoning we could acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no Difference between Good and Evil, but in ſo far as we found our Account (or thought we found it) in the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or, in other Words, the Goodneſs of things conſiſting only in their being good to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0039200600:300"/>
us, or giving us pleaſure, the Ideas of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Virtue would be ſwallow'd up in the ſole Idea of Pleaſure; and ſince vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſons muſt be own'd to be pleas'd with their Purſuits, as well as virtuous Perſons are with theirs, the moral Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe two Parties would va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. I do not ſay, that both Parties are equally pleas'd with their Purſuits; but both certainly are pleas'd. Nay, mad People are highly pleas'd with their extravagant Fancies; and where ſhall the Difference lie between them and the ſober, if Pleaſure is the only thing to be appeal'd to, and no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to be made to the common Senſe of Mankind in their right Wits? Both muſt be equally mad, or both muſt be equally ſober.</p>
               <p>THOSE Reaſoners bring themſelves into this farther Difficulty, that when 'tis ask'd them, Why they love any thing? and they make anſwer, Becauſe it gives them Pleaſure; a ſecond Queſtion (why Pleaſure?) leaves them nothing to ſay at all: unleſs they ſay they are pleas'd, becauſe they are pleas'd. Whereas others, who acknowledge the moral Difference of Things, independent of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Good, could anſwer readily, they lov'd a thing becauſe it was lovely, or good in it ſelf; which is much the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0039200600:301"/>
THE Idea of Virtue as a thing lovely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its own account, ſhews the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the old Expreſſion, <hi>viz. Virtue is its own Reward,</hi> and that meer Pleaſure (without Juſtice) does not conſtitute the Happineſs of rational Creatures; otherwiſe Vice might have been as well ſaid to be <hi>its own Reward.</hi> 'Twas pity indeed the ſincere <hi>Stoicks</hi> had not had ſome more lively Thing to fix on, than their abſtracted Notion of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: if <hi>Brutus,</hi> who perhaps had more of it than any Man at that time in <hi>Rome,</hi> had ſeen a little farther, he would not have call'd it an empty Name. But 'tis poſſible his Virtue (without diſparagement to him) has been pretty much tinctur'd with the Deſire of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, which is empty enough; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Diſtreſs and Perplexity of his Mind at that time, may have forc'd that Expreſſion from him. But <hi>Cicero,</hi> and thoſe who wrote of Virtue deliberately, always repreſent it as a real Thing, and infinitely charming.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, tho' the Underſtanding may be pleas'd with certain Ideas and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of moral Goodneſs, and the Heart (ſuppoſing it honeſt) may partake of the Delight; yet the Heart muſt have ſomething to cleave to, that has Life; ſince otherwiſe the Affections would not have an adequate or ſuitable Object: ſo that (if ſuch a way of ſpeaking can be allowed) we muſt conceive
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0039200600:302"/>
Virtue and Juſtice, and all that's lovely, even Love itſelf; as it were <hi>in Perſon,</hi> or united to an intellectual Nature.</p>
               <p>VIRTUE then is ſtill a real Thing, whatever way it be ſuppos'd to affect Men: and there can hardly be a greater Proof of its Reality, than the melancholy State thoſe are reduc'd to, <hi>who ſee it and forſake it.</hi> If a Curſe was to be wiſh'd to any, there could be none imagin'd heavier:<q>
                     <l>Virtutem videant, intabeſcantque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictâ.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Pleaſure that's found in the Practice of Virtue, is much owing to the Reliſh or good Taſte of the Soul. But as this Taſte is much vitiated ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is ſometimes repreſented as a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy Thing; and no doubt is ſo, in many reſpects: for if it were ſo very natural and eaſy as ſome make it, our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Precept of Self-Denial would be ſuperfluous; and if it were ſo very unnatural and hard as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make it, his declaring <hi>that his Yoke is eaſy,</hi> would not be agreeable to Truth. But that which is eaſy to Nature in a State of Order, is not ſo in a State of Diſorder; for Nature is one thing, and corrupt Nature another: and they who never heard of the Diſtinction, nor of the Fall, had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to recommend <hi>a Life according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0039200600:303"/>
and to maintain <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>NOW what makes Virtue uneaſy at any rate, but ſome unhappy Turn of Nature, ſome Poiſon of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> ſomething that is not right, whatever Name it get?

               <head>SECT. XII. RELIGION.</head>
               <p>AS † Religion is principally meant of Man's Duty towards God, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidered as a higher Thing than Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: yet if the Diſtinction of natural and 
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0039200600:304"/>
divine Virtue, be admitted, the higheſt Things in Religion will ſuffer no diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in being call'd <hi>Virtues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the Deſign here, and all along, is only to give a general View of Religion, and to confront it with <hi>Self-Love,</hi> in order to ſee how far it gains or loſes by its being mixed with that Principle.</p>
               <p>IF a formal Definition of Religion were to be ask'd, perhaps that might do well enough (with ſome variation) which the Civil Law gives of Juſtice, <hi>viz. a conſtant and perpetual Will to render every one his Due.</hi> A Man cannot be ſaid to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, unleſs he hath a Love for Juſtice; and this Love ought to be in a very great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath made uſe of the Words <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirſt,</hi> and placed it in the Number of the Beatitudes: <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS very true, the above Definition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents Religion as a Thing that's <hi>internal</hi>; and lying chiefly in the Heart: but this does not take away the Idea, nor the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of <hi>external</hi> Religion, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in outward Practices, either <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>inſtituted</hi>; no more than the actual <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of Juſtice is taken away, by the <hi>perpetual Inclination</hi> of doing juſtly. Virtue and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0039200600:305"/>
Vice both are internal Things, breaking out according to the Occaſions that fall in our way. We call thoſe Practices of Religion <hi>inſtituted</hi> or <hi>poſitive,</hi> the Reaſons whereof do not appear clearly to us, tho' there may be good Reaſons for them in the Wiſdom of God; if it was but to make them the Figures of higher Things, and to excite the dull Affections, by ſtriking on the outward Senſes. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably calculated for that purpoſe: And Chriſtians will hardly diſown that they have need to be awaken'd by ſenſible Impreſſions. But this by the way.</p>
               <p>THERE is a more expreſs Definition of Religion, given by a late Author; which raiſes the Idea of Juſtice very high: 'tis in theſe Words; <hi>Religion then is nothing but a reſpectful Worſhip of Juſtice and Truth, which makes us treat God as God, and the Creatures as Creatures.</hi> Perhaps few Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions will be found more exact, and there is none that captious Spirits will not cenſure: this at leaſt agrees with Mr. <hi>Wollaſton</hi>'s Rule<note n="*" place="bottom">Religion of Nature.</note>, <hi>to treat things as they are.</hi> 'Tis alſo very plain, that the trueſt Worſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Imitation, and Imitation is the Effect of Love: ſo that whatever Ideas we form of Religion, if they be form'd right, they all hang together in an Order that may be call'd
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0039200600:306"/>
natural, and whereof Reaſon itſelf may ſee the Conſiſtency.</p>
               <p>AS to Mr. <hi>Wollaſton,</hi> his Rule is moſt juſt: but then we can make no more of it, but <hi>to treat things</hi> only as they appear to us, or according to the Notions we have of them; and however imperfect theſe may be, we may be ſaid to act juſtly if we follow our Light. But the ſame Apoſtle, who tells us <hi>that the Gentiles do by Nature the Things contain'd in the Law,</hi> tells us alſo <hi>that the natural Man knoweth not the Things of God</hi>; and <hi>that they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> The Things therefore contain'd in the Law ſhould ſeem to be thoſe Acts of Humanity and natural Juſtice, which we find inſtances of in all Times and Places; and the Things of God may be ſuppoſed to be meant both of his unſearchable Nature, and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Religion, which are but reveal'd as it were hiſtorically, or <hi>that they are,</hi> not <hi>how they are</hi>; and therefore, as the Apoſtle concludes, only to be <hi>diſcern'd</hi> by a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Light.</p>
               <p>THE natural Ignorance of Man will eaſily be confeſs'd by thoſe who acknowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion: and let thoſe who deny it tell us honeſtly what things they know <hi>really,</hi> or in their true Nature. Indeed the Rule <hi>of treating things as they are,</hi> holds very well as to certain Relations and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters:
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0039200600:307"/>
Parents, for inſtance, ought to be treated as Parents, and Children as Children; and ſo of other Relations. Again, People of Worth are to be treated in a different Manner from the Worthleſs; and in all Caſes, Prudence and Equity (which are never ſeparate) will know how to diſtribute and render what is due to every Relation and Character.</p>
               <p>BY thus conſidering the Difference of Relations and Characters, we may form ſome imperfect Notions of our Duty, even to our Maker and the Creator of all Things. If we ſuppoſe a Being of infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, the Obligations of Fear, Reverence and Love naturally ariſe: Reaſon itſelf goes ſo far, as to make that plain Inference and Concluſion. Nor can we hinder ourſelves from making ſuch a Suppoſition, if we allow Reaſon any Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe at all. We ſee and feel enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us of the Exiſtence of ſuch a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Being, unleſs we are ſtupid or hurry'd out of our Reflection. Tho' we cannot comprehend the divine Nature, we cannot fail to ſee <hi>that it is</hi>; elſe we muſt fall into the Abſurdities of imagining Things that are made, to have made themſelves, or to have been made by nothing; or elſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Maker and the Works together, like <hi>Spinoza</hi>; who, in that point, imitated
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0039200600:308"/>
ſome of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and (with them) is imitated by later Authors.</p>
               <p>RELIGION now is principally to be taken for the Duties we owe to God: What we owe to Men is uſually call'd <hi>Morality,</hi> tho' it is alſo a conſiderable Part of Religion, as being enjoin'd by God, who puts no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue on any thing we do to ſhew our Homage to him, if we neglect our Duties to our Neighbour. This is confirm'd by many Places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>RELIGION alſo may be divided into the <hi>internal</hi> and the <hi>external,</hi> and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the <hi>moral</hi> and the <hi>ceremonial.</hi> What a Man hath of the internal, can only be known to God; and the <hi>external</hi> will only be approved by him, as it proceeds from the <hi>internal.</hi> To inſtance even in the moral Part; Giving of Alms (which is of more value than going to Church) is rejected by God, when it is done only <hi>to be ſeen of Men</hi>; or it is ſo far rejected, as it is tinctur'd with that Principle: for our Saviour told the Phariſees, <hi>they had already their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS true, the ceremonial Part of Religion is much aboliſhed by the Chriſtian Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation (the Jewiſh Ceremonies certainly are) and the few Inſtitutions or poſitive Precepts in it may deſerve a higher Character; tho'
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0039200600:309"/>
ſtill they are but Ceremonies, when the Heart does not go along with them. What elſe is taking the Communion to ſecure an Employment? Baptiſm alſo is a Matter of Parade in the Parents for the moſt part, and the Children generally think as little about it when they come to Age, as in their Infancy. There is this Difference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore between the <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>poſitive</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, that the former are of uſe to others, even tho' they are not done from a right Principle; but the latter, unleſs they be done from a right Principle, are good for nothing.</p>
               <p>BUT true Religion, as it contains all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſo it will not omit any the leaſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances, whether it may think them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, or Men having his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; nay, tho' it is not ſo ſure of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it will ſubmit for Peace ſake, when the things enjoin'd ſeem to impart no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to Society, nor any Diſhonour to the divine Nature.</p>
               <p>'TIS only with reference to that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage and Diſhonour, that the Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true and falſe Religion has come in uſe: for falſe Religion is no Religion. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Difference between the diſowning all Religion (which is Atheiſm) and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ariſing either from the Confuſion of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0039200600:310"/>
the Underſtanding, or the Perverſeneſs of the Will; and the laſt is by far the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt. Bigotry and Superſtition flow from a diſturb'd Underſtanding. Blind Zeal or religious Fury ariſes more from the Temper or Complexion, if theſe are proper Words; and what is call'd Enthuſiaſm is generally from the ſame Fountain. I have no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to enquire into all the Sources of Error. But Religion (which may be call'd <hi>the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that cometh from above</hi>) <hi>is firſt pure, and then peaceable,</hi> &amp;c. Hypocriſy does not even deſerve the Name of falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: 'tis a Cheat upon the World, either to get Money or Applauſe, or both, when they can be had.</p>
               <p>How many things may be added on this Subject! But I ſhall refer to a few Hints in the <note n="*" place="bottom">No. V.</note>Appendix, from which the Reader will eaſily draw a thouſand more.</p>

The Love of other Creatures (that is, an ultimate Acquieſcence in them) is juſtly reckon'd an Abſurdity as well as an Impiety, becauſe of their natural Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to ſatisfy the Heart. But ſtill they are Supports of a certain kind, which <hi>Self</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, ſince it is like a <hi>Void,</hi> that wants other things to fill it. So that the Self-Complacency of a Creature is much of the ſame import with <hi>Self-Deluſion</hi>; the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Creature always ſuppoſing Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. For as the Body cannot be Food to itſelf, ſo the Soul muſt depend for its Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0039200600:312"/>
upon ſome other thing than itſelf. And this Difference is to be remember'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, that the Soul cannot fall to pieces like the Body, but ſubſiſts by its unexſtinguiſhable Nature (in Miſery and Anguiſh) when its Deſires are not ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>'TIS very true, in this ſhort Dream of Life the Soul has ſeveral Deſires; and theſe more upon the Body's account than its own: nay, often we cannot ſay the things we deſire are of uſe, either to Soul or Body; for inſtance, <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Ribbons.</hi> But the Fancy (with a mixture of Pride) finds its account in ſuch things; and to that Source we may refer moſt of the Deſires of Men, Women and Children.</p>
               <p>IF it ſhall be ſaid, that thoſe Marks of Diſtinction not only draw more Money, but alſo the Eſteem of others; it muſt be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch as are fanciful like ourſelves. A thorow Pride leads to the Contempt of all external Riches and Pomp, that we may be thought ſufficient for ourſelves, like the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in his Tub. I ſhall not determine that <hi>Diogenes</hi> was led by the ſole Deſire of Eſteem and Admiration, tho' it was ſo ſaid by ſome of his Contemporaries, who have ſeen his weak ſides as he has ſeen theirs: but wherever that Deſire prevails, it concludes for the Inſufficiency of <hi>Self</hi> as an Object of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0039200600:313"/>
Love or Complacency, ſince we cannot be eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but from without.</p>
               <p>NOR can we ever be ſaid in this Life to be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> but only <hi>amuſed</hi> by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one Rattle or Feather after another; (the Delights of Friendſhip are not of this Claſs:) and when we come to ſhake off this Body, and our Stupidity with it, what a State, can we think, the Soul will be in, that has been only accuſtomed to delight in Vanity, and follow Shadows; when all its imaginary Buildings are pull'd down, and nothing remains but Remorſe, Shame, Horror, and what no Words are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to expreſs! This is upon the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a future Life: and Chriſtians profeſs a Belief even of the Reſurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Senſes of which will be infinitely more quick, both as to Pain and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than here. Men will make little by their <hi>Self-Love</hi> at the Day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>As the Conſequences of <hi>Self-Love</hi> are ſuch as have been repreſented, tho' ſaintly; the Conſequences of loving the moſt perfect Object with the moſt perfect Love, are not only Reſt and Joy to the Heart, but the whole Man is dignified and exalted. The Underſtanding is enlighten'd, and the Heart enlarged, as <hi>David</hi> expreſſes it. If the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love poſſeſs'd us, we ſhould be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge thoſe <hi>little, narrow, proud, angry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0039200600:314"/>
                  <hi>Creatures, ſhut up in a hard Shell</hi>; we ſhould then be free, in another Element, and without Strife. <hi>Charity</hi> is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Union, <hi>Self-Love</hi> the Principle of Diviſion.</p>
               <p>ALL this appears from the Nature of Things, and Experience of the World. Bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Gentlemen who follow the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> every body complains of the Imperfections of Nature, which is indeed in a very poor State; and not only imperfect, but wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly diſorder'd. To take a view of Body and Soul, many things occur, that are very diſagreeable, and particularly with reſpect to the <hi>moral</hi> World, (ſtill more out of order than the natural;) and let any body judge what thoſe things are owing to. Our <hi>Self-Love</hi> not only makes us <hi>the Tyrants of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> but alſo our own Executioners, and <hi>Self-Tormentors:</hi> whereas the divine Love, by making us loſe ſight of ourſelves, leads us both into Truth and Peace. It rectifies our corrupted Taſte: 'Tis no longer inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient miſerable <hi>We,</hi> that are the Deities, but Honour is given where it is due. If we ſee any thing excellent in our Neighbour, we love it and him as Rays of the divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. If ever we turn an Eye to ourſelves (and the ſeldomer we do it with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, the better) we ſhall conſider ourſelves, and every thing we have as deriv'd from that Source.</p>

                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0039200600:315"/>
IF we obſerve this Order, there can be no Error. We can hardly love ourſelves too much, if we love our Neighbour as much; that is, if both theſe Loves center in a higher. And leſt People ſhould deceive themſelves with a Fancy that they love God, when they do not, they ought to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſee whether they love their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours alſo: <hi>for he that loveth not his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whom he hath ſeen; how can he love God, whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>

               <head>SECT. XIV. The LOVE of the CREATURES.</head>
               <p>AS we have no Commerce or known Connection with any rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of another Species than our own, and Love always ſuppoſing a Deſire of Union with the Object; we can only be ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to love Mankind, and but to deſire the Poſſeſſion of other created things, which are ſtill leſs able to ſatisfy our Heart.</p>
               <p>'TIS to be conſider'd too, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of our own Species, as they are deſir'd by <hi>Self-Love</hi> only for our own Utility, are reduc'd to the ſame Claſs of inferiour things; to the great indignity and contempt of human Nature; nor are the Defects of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0039200600:316"/>
Nature, either as to Soul or Body, any reaſon for treating it at ſuch a low rate. If the Body decays and rots, it is but in the Condition of Plants and Vegetables; and if Gold and precious Stones are of a firmer Conſiſtence and Duration, than any animal or vegetable Body, yet our Love of thoſe glittering Things, is more on account of the Diſtinction they give us, than for any ſenſible Pleaſure they are able to convey. 'Tis true, the Eye has a certain Pleaſure in looking at them: but then <hi>the Eye is never ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us ſuppoſe, that all the Creatures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are not able to ſatisfy the Heart of Man, and then ſee what Inference Reaſon might make from the Suppoſition: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference would ſeem to be this, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt naturally have recourſe to the Deity, as the ſole Object of their Acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Love. But we ſee how ſmall advances Reaſon made this way: the great Body of Mankind were intent only on ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their lower Appetites, and their Pride; and the Philoſophers (who deſpis'd them) were ignorant themſelves of the true State of things: The Corruption of Man and the Fall was not found out by Man, but diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him by Revelation. This is ſo true, that ſome of the Philoſophers, who were ſenſible enough of the Defects of the viſible Creation, rais'd an Objection from thence
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0039200600:317"/>
againſt Providence, and even a creating Power.</p>
               <p>No body ſhews better than Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> the oppoſite and imperfect Schemes of the Philoſophers<note n="*" place="bottom">Sect. iii, &amp;c.</note>, for want of that Diſcovery of the Fall. If at preſent the great Roll of Miſeries and Calamities are objected, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the Divine Providence; and thoſe diſmal Scenes appeal'd to, that are fo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently heard of, Murders, Robberies, Frauds, War, Peſtilence, Famine, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, Hurricanes, Inundations; in ſhort, all the Evils, whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral,</hi> which afflict and deſtroy poor Mankind; to ſay nothing of bodily Diſeaſes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Death, which attacks us in ſo many Forms, and often without any warning: if all thoſe things be objected, it will mend the matter nothing to deny, (with the <hi>Stoicks</hi>) that there is any Evil: it will be more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to acknowledge (with St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii.</note>) that <hi>the whole Creation groaneth.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will be very proper to keep in mind the Difference between moral Evils and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and to impute all that belongs to the firſt Claſs to the Corruption of Man, and even to <hi>Self-Love</hi>; as the natural Evils may be reckon'd either as Puniſhments of the moral, or ſometimes as Preventions.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0039200600:318"/>
How many Extravagancies are prevented, as well as puniſhed by Sickneſs and Poverty!</p>
               <p>As to the natural Evils, and Death itſelf, they cannot be ſuppos'd (no more than the moral Evils) to have been in the firſt Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of things. <note n="*" place="bottom">Wiſd. i. 15.</note>

               <p>BUT farther, all the Evils that are either felt or heard of (ſometimes indeed very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible) may yet be call'd little, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Good that remains in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The Eruption of a burning Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is but like a Chimney on fire in a great City: And the Service of the Elements in general is a large Equivalent for the Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations they ſometimes occaſion, as the Pleaſure and Fertility of a River makes well up for what it carries away in a Stream. Not to mention the Beauty and Regularity of the Heavenly Bodies, with their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Influences, (a Theme often and to good purpoſe inſiſted on) which ſufficiently <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xix.</note>
                  <hi>declare the Glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOME late Ridiculers of Providence, who do not ſpeak out, have occaſion'd this little Digreſſion, in acknowledgment of the infinite Power and Wiſdom that fram'd the World, and ſtill ſupports it, in a ſurprizing Luſtre and Harmony. They would alſo have
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0039200600:319"/>
it believed that the World is without Virtue, as well as without a Governour; and argue from the common Practices of Men, of whom they reckon Chriſtians the worſt, and take a handle from thence to diſparage Chriſtianity. But their Cavils againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion ſignify nothing, who deny the natural; as theirs ſignify as little who aſcribe more to the natural than its due, and who are juſtly ſuſpected of a Deſign againſt all Religion, and as ſecret Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Atheiſm, by denying that Religion, which alone accounts for the preſent Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Men and Things.</p>
               <p>WE are indeed in a mixt State, and a very tolerable one. As we are among Thorns and Briars, ſo we are among Roſes and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets: and our State here is juſtly reckon'd a State of Tryal and Diſcipline. The Belief of a better Life afterwards, and if we add the Fall from Paradiſe, will make <hi>the preſent Afflictions light,</hi> and account pretty well for Affliction itſelf.</p>
               <p>'TIS in the view of the afflicted, broken, unſatisfying State of things, that the Love of the World and the Creatures is ſo much forbidden in Sacred Writ: Mankind being often addreſs'd with Arguments from their own Intereſt, as well as from the Point of Juſtice. The <hi>natural</hi> Diſorders of the World
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0039200600:320"/>
ſeem to be the Conſequences of the <hi>moral.</hi> Our Lives are ſhort, our Bodies weak and full of Diſeaſes, as if the Souls that inhabit them could not have a fitter Lodging: And from theſe <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>giddy</hi> Souls proceed more Sorrows than can be number'd. The Enquirers into the Origin of moral Evil will ever be at a loſs to account for it. We ſee there is Pride, tho' we cannot tell how it firſt enter'd; and all our Speculations labour under Difficulties. But we ſee that <hi>of Pride cometh Contention,</hi> and that it doth more miſchief in the World than Covetouſneſs and Luxury put together.</p>
               <p>THE Love of the Creatures then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, becauſe they are <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> of themſelves; and by the Love of the World may be meant the Paſſion of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common Cuſtom, as well as that of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying our own Inclinations, ſome of which we muſt often drop for fear of Cenſure.</p>
               <p>BUT the Love which is thus condemn'd, is more properly a Dotage: even the Love of rational Creatures may be ſo, and the Love of Money and <hi>fine Things</hi> deſerves not ſo good a Name as Dotage, but rather Avarice and Folly. The Love of rational Creatures is more excuſable on account of their Relation to us; and the natural Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city they have of delighting us, as any body will acknowledge, who has the leaſt Senſe
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0039200600:321"/>
of Friendſhip, or even a Satisfaction in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faces and keeping Company. At the ſame time, rational Creatures are full of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, and but like Apparitions for their Duration: ſo that our Reſt is not to be in them. Nor, on the other hand, are their Imperfections ſo to diſguſt us, as to make us hate and deſpiſe them. The Command of loving our Neighbour imports a great deal, and is a divine thing, wherever we are not allured to it from our own Satisfaction; for in that caſe it may be call'd <hi>natural Love</hi> (the Object making an agreeable Impreſſion upon us) but not <hi>Self-Love</hi> or <hi>intereſted Love,</hi> unleſs our own Intereſt were the only Spring of it. And 'tis ſtill to be remember'd, that the <hi>divine</hi> Principle does not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the <hi>natural,</hi> and that the Pleaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the Conſtitution of things is not to be call'd <hi>Self-Love,</hi> nor the Effect of Selfiſhneſs, no more than it is ſelfiſh to be pleas'd with the Light of the Sun. In fine, tho' we ſhould neither ſuppoſe a Fall nor a future State, the Arguments for <hi>Self-Love</hi> (by which all along has been meant the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh Principle) can have no Foundation: for if we do any thing that can be call'd <hi>good</hi> with reference to others, it is only ſo far <hi>good</hi> as we do it upon their account: And for this we may appeal to the common Senſe of Mankind, eſpecially to thoſe who have not been corrupted with Books.</p>

               <head>SECT. XV. The LOVE of GOD.</head>
               <p>RELIGION being conſidered as our Duty to God, the higheſt part of this Duty is Love, which may be call'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Duties. Particular Commands and Prohibitions ſeem only to have been given for leading Man back to that Love, which was natural to him in his firſt State.</p>
               <p>IT was ſaid before, (Sect. vii.) that Love in general implies a Deſire after the Object, and a Delight in it. Now the Perfections of the divine Nature demonſtrate the Love of God to be perfectly reaſonable, both in the Purſuit and the Acquieſcence. And tho' Love is called <hi>blind,</hi> as in ſome reſpect it is really ſo; yet the Underſtanding being <hi>enlighten'd, actuated,</hi> and <hi>influenced</hi> by the ſame unerring Spirit that influenceth the Heart, both theſe Powers are in perfect Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Harmony; and their Operations conſequently muſt be <hi>compleat, rational,</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> every way <hi>right, ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>conſiſtent</hi>; nothing feeble, nothing fooliſh, nothing defective. The poor Expreſſions of Men, are more defective than their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0039200600:323"/>
BUT however imperfect either our Words or our Ideas may be, we can well enough perceive the Diſtinctions of things and their Properties. Nor does any Diſtinction ſeem more neceſſary to be kept in mind, than that of the Underſtanding and the Heart. By the former we diſcern the Beauty of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and by the latter we love it or cleave to it: In agreeable Objects each of thoſe Faculties is pleas'd, but the Pleaſures are different. Again, our Underſtanding is the Seat of our Opinions, the Heart is the Seat of our Inclinations.</p>
               <p>UPON the different Operations of theſe two Faculties, Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> forms an Argument for the diſintereſted or pure Love of God; <note n="*" place="bottom">No. IV.</note>the Subſtance of which is, <q rend="inline">"That as Truth is the Object of the Intellect, and is aſſented to becauſe it is true, without regard to the particular Underſtanding that contemplates it; ſo Goodneſs is the Object of Love, which is lov'd chiefly for its own Excellency."</q> And he concludes, <q rend="inline">"We may as well affirm that there is no Underſtanding, but what is ſelf-intereſted, as that there is no Love but what is ſelf-intereſted."</q>
               </p>
               <p>No body was ever found that deny'd to Mankind a Faculty of <hi>loving,</hi> as well as a
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0039200600:324"/>
Faculty of <hi>diſcerning:</hi> and one may be bold to ſay, that Love is ſo much the Perfection and Happineſs of our Nature, that 'tis deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable it were not directed to the proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and attended with all the Conditions that render it worthy.</p>
               <p>THE Heart is a Term both for the loving Faculty, and Love itſelf. <hi>Where your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is, there will your Heart be alſo:</hi> and <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thine Heart.</hi> It is indeed added, <hi>and with all thy Might</hi>; to ſhew that the Dignity of the Object requires that all our Faculties and their utmoſt Force ſhould be employed in Love and Adoration. Again, an <hi>honeſt Heart</hi> is taken for a ſincere Intention; and in ſhort, the Heart is conſider'd as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing in Man. <hi>My Son, give me thy Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have the rather mention'd this obvious Diſtinction of the Heart and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that ſome (and I believe very good Perſons) have conſidered the Love of God only as an Act of the Underſtanding, by which the ſupreme Being is adored for its Excellencies, and lov'd alſo; but chiefly loved, becauſe thoſe Excellencies are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to us: and ſuch Perſons are ſo much afraid of falling into <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> (meaning the Extravagance of a warm Imagination) that they exclude Love wholly from the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0039200600:325"/>
Heart, leſt it ſhould be call'd a <hi>Paſſion,</hi> or an indiſcreet thing. But why may there not be divine Paſſions, as well as human? Spiritual Affections, as well as natural? The Imagination is by no means the Seat of Love, any more than it is the Seat of Hatred, Joy, or any other Affection of the Soul. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Imagination may impoſe upon us, or be impoſed upon itſelf, this is but like ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thro' a falſe Glaſs; the Operations of the Heart belonging to a quite different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"THE true Love of God (ſays a late <note n="*" place="bottom">Free-Thinker. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. ccxvi.</note>Writer) is calm, and ſedate, and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. The crackling Blaze of Paſſion is ſoon over; it dazles, and it ſcorches, for a moment; but leaves no laſting Warmth: whereas the ſilent Glowings of the Heart are ſtrong, and durable; and preſerve an equal Temper of Heat."</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is very well expreſs'd. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor does not exclude the Love of God from the Heart; he rather ſays it ought to be there always, only in a <hi>calm ſedate manner.</hi> But who can give Rules to Love? The State of the Heart, either as to its Sedateneſs or its Diſturbance, its Coolneſs or its Warmth, depends chiefly on the divine Power that acts upon it; and the ſame Perſon at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times is under very different Operations;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0039200600:326"/>
in Diſtreſs, in Joy, in Hopes, in Fears; as is evident from many Paſſagges in ſacred Writ.</p>
               <p>I have not the leaſt intention of falling into a Diſpute with this Author, for I know nothing at all about him, nor have ſeen any of his Papers but this ſingle one. I'm willing only to quote ſome of his Expreſſions, as being among the beſt and the modeſteſt that are to be found in the Advocates for <hi>Self-Love,</hi> who often write both ſaucily and confuſedly.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <q rend="inline">"Whoever traces our Love of others, he will find, it ultimately termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in <hi>ourſelves</hi>; and that our Affection towards any Perſon is in reality a Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome kind Offices we either have received, or do (at leaſt) expect from him. It is true, we often have a tender Regard and a Value for thoſe who have been Benefactors to others, tho' they never extended their Kindneſs to us: But he who ſearches deep into human Nature may obſerve, that here likewiſe we give a ſecret Glance towards ourſelves, and love the generous Perſon, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did good to another, as becauſe we imagine we alſo ſhould have felt the ſame Effects of his Munificence, had he ſeen us in the like indigent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0039200600:327"/>
HERE the Charge againſt <hi>Self-Love</hi> is carried as high as neceſſary, tho' the Author ſeems to have deſign'd it no diſparagement. The Search into human Nature can hardly be deep enough, ſo very latent is the Byaſs towards ourſelves. But the Retaliation of good Offices is by no means to be found fault with, Gratitude being a part of Juſtice; and it can have no Tincture of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> when we expect no ſuch Offices for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. What ſeems to be unnatural in the Account given of our Love of generous Perſons, is the founding it on an Imagination, that we ſhould have felt the ſame Effects of their Generoſity; which is at moſt but a poſteriour Reflection, and 'tis poſſible the Fancy might never enter into one's head. And tho' the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>we love God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> this is to ſhew the Excellency of God's Love above ours; we having ſuch Motives for loving him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had none for loving us.</p>
               <p>THE Oppoſition made to the pure Love of God, by Perſons of Integrity and good Senſe, has certainly ariſen from the Abuſe which has been made of that Doctrine by weak People, or vile Pretenders; the former really taking their own Fancies for the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Almighty, and ſo falling into ſhameful Familiarity and nauſeous Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and the latter ſort, having no Senſe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0039200600:328"/>
of Religion at all, have by their Pretences to the higheſt Things in it, impos'd upon the Society they liv'd in, and ſometimes ſubjected them to their Dominion and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny: as in the caſe of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> and others. Hence the Cry of <hi>Enthuſiaſm, heated Imagination,</hi> and the like. Hence the Love of God is put in oppoſition to all Affection, and confin'd to a ſimple Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the divine Attributes, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) a deſire of keeping the divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, which may be more from a Regard to ourſelves than the Deity. True Love leads naturally to the keeping of the Commands of God: and our Saviour only makes it the Teſt of Love, to undeceive any who may vainly think they love him without that inward Diſpoſition and outward Mark.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER thing that may have frighted People from the pure Love of God, is their imagining it muſt cut off all natural and lawful Affections. But this Fear is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: <hi>Husbands love your Wives,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle. Tho' God is to be loved with all our Heart, yet we may and ought to love ſome inferiour things, if we love them in the due Order and Meaſure: even <hi>Self-Love</hi> may ſtand, if it be turn'd down to its proper Station.</p>
               <p>BUT as our Happineſs does not conſiſt in the Love of ourſelves, but in the Enjoyment
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0039200600:329"/>
of things ſuited to our ſeveral Faculties; ſo the ſupreme Happineſs and Perfection of all intelligent Natures muſt conſiſt only in the Love and Adoration of the eternal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. No words can expreſs the Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Divine Nature, and Mortals when they ſpeak of it ſhould be afraid of ſpeaking abſurdly. <hi>The Heavens are not pure in his ſight, and he charges the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with Folly.</hi> What is Man, wretched Man, that he ſhould preſume to open his Mouth on ſuch a Subject? But the Love of God is a known Expreſſion, and a thing of all things the moſt reaſonable; and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately diſputed! By the Love of God muſt be meant the whole of Man's Duty and Happineſs; two diſtinct Ideas, but inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably connected together.</p>
               <p>ST. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives a Reaſon for that great Duty, beſides the point of Juſtice, from the Deſign of our Exiſtence and the Nature of our Soul. He ſays,  <q rend="inline">

'TIS true, <hi>Moſes</hi> lays it down with the Authority of a Lawgiver, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy Heart,</hi> &amp;c. But the Command carries its Reaſon within it, if the Mind is but attentive. For without doubt the moſt proper Object of our Love muſt be, that which is in itſelf the moſt perfect; that which, tho' we love ever ſo much, we can never love up to its worth, having ſtill new and greater Cauſe to love it: and this can be nothing elſe but the alone uncreated, the infinite and eternal Beauty. <hi>Plato</hi>'s Method of Aſcent from the Love of Beauty, which we ſee in the Body, to that which we ſee in the Soul, and from that to the immenſe Ocean of Beauty, is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome who do not deny, that God ought to be loved with all the Heart, or the Affection, in the Words of <hi>Moſes</hi>; but then they would make Self-Intereſt the only Foundation of all Love, which ſeems not at all reaſonable; and, as it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> ſufficiently expoſes the Opinion.

THE greateſt part of what has been ſaid in this Article, has been to ſettle a Point of Speculation or bare Philoſophy, rather than to make Encomiums on the thing itſelf: for there need none to thoſe who feel it; and thoſe who feel it not, will hardly be affected with Words. All a Perſon can do, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to ſay any thing of it without feeling it, is to ask pardon of thoſe that do or wiſh to feel it. And perhaps the Pardon will be granted, when 'tis conſidered that this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine has been ſo much decry'd of late, and the oppoſite Doctrine magnified as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Virtue, and made the Foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: a miſerable Foundation! it has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the diſparagement of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and given a handle for Ridicule and Triumph to its Oppoſers, not to be anſwered but by owning the diſintereſted Principle, and placing Religion upon that ſolid and cleanly Foundation.</p>
               <p>THE Reader may ſee how far the Ridicule has been carried in the <hi>Characteriſticks,</hi> by the Quotation in the Margin<note n="*" place="bottom">Modern Projectors, I know, would willingly rid their hands of theſe natural Materials, and would fain build after a more uniform way. They would new frame the human Heart; and have a mighty fancy to reduce all its Motions, Ballances, and Weights, to that one Principle and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a cool and deliberate <hi>Selfiſhneſs.</hi> Men, it ſeems, are unwilling to think they can be ſo outwitted, and impos'd on by Nature, as to be made to ſerve her Purpoſes, rather than their own. They are aſham'd to be drawn thus out of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and forc'd from what they eſteem their true Intereſt.</note>, and indeed
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0039200600:333"/>
with good Senſe as well as Severity. But the Blame falls only upon the <hi>modern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors,</hi> not upon the Chriſtian Doctrine, which ought not to ſuffer from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome who meddle to explain it: and one thing is remarkable, that the Deiſts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times agree with thoſe very <hi>Projectors</hi> they had deſpiſed; for their Syſtem of <hi>calm Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence</hi> and <hi>Self-Approbation</hi> is much about one with the <hi>cool deliberate Selfiſhneſs</hi> of the other Party.</p>
               <p>BUT the unquiet Heart of Man muſt have ſomewhat elſe to ſatisfy it than its own Approbation, as may eaſily appear from the Inſufficiency of created Beings, and the reſtleſs Purſuits of Men. And here one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve, how this Sett of the Deiſts and ſome of the Clergy diſtreſs each other on the Article of <hi>Self-Love</hi>; the Deiſts charging the Clergy with a finer ſort of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſm; ſince the moſt corrupt Perſon in the World is willing to renounce ſmaller Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for greater. And, on the other hand, the Clergy object againſt the Deiſts, <q rend="inline">"That it Self-Approbation is their principal Aim, they muſt hug a Phantom. And not only ſo, but their Pride, which fills them with the Notion of their own Excellency, muſt render them incapable of thoſe Joys and Perfections only inherent in the Deity, and only communicable to ſuch Spirits,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0039200600:334"/>
as are diſpoſſeſs'd of ſuch imaginary Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and real Arrogance."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BY the by, this <hi>Stoical</hi> old-faſhion'd Pride has been of late dreſs'd up into a kind of Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, by which the defective Nature of Man (to ſay no worſe of it) and the whole viſible Creation, are repreſented as quite free of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and Evil. Now tho' it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to argue againſt Experience, or to talk People out of their Senſes; yet it is poſſible ſome Minds of a certain Caſt may at length imagine their own particular Nature to be of ſuch Perfection, as to ſtand in need of no Helps but what they have from within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or, in other words, that their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a ſufficient Guide for all Purpoſes of Belief and Practice; and conſequently that they are not obliged to aſſent to any thing but what they ſee clearly by this light: nay, that it were abſurd even to be in ſuſpenſe about it, but immediately to reject it; and that, as to Practice, their Inclinations being free from any wrong Biaſs or Tendency, there can be no better Guides than theſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! From hence proceeds the Averſion to all Revelation, and to the Clergy or Prieſts of all Religions, whom they look upon as too cunning for the reſt of Mankind, and ſometimes do them the honour to call them, <hi>the Compilers of the Sacred Records themſelves</hi>; not adverting to the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Facts, nor the Purity of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0039200600:335"/>
Doctrines, from which indeed the Lives of the Clergy as well as the Laity are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, to the hearty Regret of the ſincere among all Ranks. And there is nothing but Inſincerity (a hard Suppoſition) or plain Deluſion, that can account for ſuch a ſtrange Repreſentation of the Excellency of human Nature, as to reject all Neceſſity of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, Revelation, and the continual Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Divine Spirit on the impure fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirits of Men, who are Blunderers in the commoneſt Affairs. When one thinks of the Ignorance and Corruption of human Nature, one is almoſt in danger of falling in with the oppoſite Party of Deiſts, (and perhaps the Name is too good for either Party) who allow nothing at all to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that's good, not ſo much as the leaſt Approbation of Virtue, nor any Virtue and Decency, but what the fantaſtical Humour of People happens to eſtabliſh. But 'tis hard to ſay which of the Extremes is worſt: And ſome Perſons have been very unſucceſsful when they undertook to go the middle way, and would needs lay the Foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and all Duty upon <hi>Self-Love</hi>; the very thing, which Religion deſigns to extirpate; that is, the ſelfiſh Principle in which a Man's Good is his higheſt Motive, or himſelf the Center of all his Aims. But to return.</p>
               <p>THE Aſſerters of the diſintereſted Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple have this to ſupport their Doctrine, that
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0039200600:336"/>
if one was to conſider Love, as it is in the divine Nature, the firſt Idea that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably occur, would be that of <hi>a free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Good</hi>; as the Sun ſends forth its Light and its Heat.</p>
               <p>THE Source of Joy and Bliſs can want nothing for himſelf: ſo that the Deſign of making Creatures, is to impart Happineſs or Good to them. And 'tis very remarkable that St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>God is Love, and God is Light</hi>; as if he had deſign'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the Deity to our imperfect Conception under the Characters of diſintereſted Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diffuſive Joy.</p>
               <p>'TIS true, God is ſaid <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xvi. 4.</note>
                  <hi>to have made every thing for himſelf:</hi> for every thing muſt be made for ſome end by an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Agent: and the Source of all Power, Wiſdom, and Beauty, and whatever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, muſt be an End to itſelf; ſince there can be no End higher. Again, we hear of the arbitrary Pleaſure of God; <note n="†" place="bottom">Revel. iv.</note>
                  <hi>He hath created all things, and for his Pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> But the Idea of Goodneſs is inſeparable from that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>SUCH is truely the inexpreſſible Love of God, that he may be ſaid to hire us to do
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0039200600:337"/>
good to ourſelves. He has annexed Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure even to thoſe low things Eating and Drinking, as if we were to be bribed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our own poor Fabrick, as well as to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the Earth.</hi> Nor are theſe Pleaſures deny'd to the inferiour Creatures: Every thing living has its Enjoyments. So that tho' the common way of ſpeaking be true, <q rend="inline">"God hath made every Creature for his own Glory, and all things here on Earth for the Uſe of Man;"</q> yet it is no leſs true, that he makes every Creature that has Life for its own good. And if we might ſuppoſe greater and leſſer Motives in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible God, we would have reaſon to conclude that the good of Creatures is his greateſt Motive in creating them. He has no need of us, and we have need of every thing from Him.</p>
               <p>WE are farther told, that Mankind ſtands in a near Relation to the Deity: <hi>For we are his Offspring,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays from a <hi>Greek</hi> Poet, which was the fitteſt Authority he could bring to thoſe he was arguing with; tho' it was a bold ſtroke enough in that Poet: but it is ſupported by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſays, <hi>God made Man after his own Image</hi>; and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has enjoin'd us <hi>to be perfect, as our Father in Heaven is perfect</hi>; ſhewing us at once our Relation and our Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0039200600:338"/>
THIS Relation (which we could not have ſuppoſed without the greateſt Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance) makes the Duty the more apparent. We ought to imitate the Divine Nature, and <hi>be perfect</hi> as far as we are able. Now where can this Perfection lie in us, but in Diſintereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs? 'Tis the only thing wherein we can imitate the Almighty, who (we are told a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) <hi>does good even to the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful.</hi> Love muſt be diſintereſted, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, or mixt: 'tis undiſputedly diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted towards ourſelves, and is enjoin'd to be ſo towards others, <hi>even the Wicked:</hi> how much more ſo ought it to be towards the Fountain of all Good? This ſeems to be plain Reaſoning, and no <hi>high Flight,</hi> as the pure Love of God has been unfortunately call'd by ſome Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, and thence a handle given the Enemies of that Religion to diſparage it.</p>
               <p>IF God then loves us diſintereſtedly, 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think we ought to love him after the ſame manner: and if Love implies Union, that Condition of loving <hi>purely</hi> cannot be wanting; as it is only in Purity or Diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtedneſs that we can find the Idea of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, by which every thing has its due, and is loved for its own Worth.</p>
               <p>THE two Objections againſt the pure Love of God (for a third can hardly be imagin'd)
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0039200600:339"/>
are firſt, that our Nature cannot attain to it; and ſecondly, that it is not required of us. If the firſt were true, the ſecond would be ſo of courſe; for impoſſible things wou'd not be required by the God of Righteouſneſs. But it is plainly required in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that we ſhould love God with all our Heart</hi>; and by our Saviour in the <hi>New,</hi> who makes it <hi>the Sum of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> The annexing Promiſes and Threats, appears eaſily a Condeſcenſion to human Weakneſs.</p>
               <p>LET our Nature be call'd as weak and corrupt as any body has a mind, for 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in a very pitiful Condition; but let not the Capacity be denied of being <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into a new Nature</hi> by the Power of God, or what is call'd <hi>Grace,</hi> as being out of the number of ordinary or moral Virtues, which muſt be own'd to <hi>come from above</hi> alſo. 'Tis for Grace that Prayers are ſo often put up by the Clergy of all Denominations, and the Love of God is pray'd for in expreſs terms. Properly Grace means Favour, and the Love of God to us is the higheſt Favour that can be vouchſaf'd; as our Love to him is the greateſt Tribute we can offer, and at the ſame time the moſt perfect State we can be in, and the happieſt for ourſelves. By Grace is farther underſtood the Removal of thoſe Impediments and Obſtructions which hinder the divine Influences from operating on the Hearts of Men; and ſo the Prayer runs,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0039200600:340"/>
                  <hi>Cleanſe our Hearts by the Inſpirations of thy holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. For the Divine Nature may be compared to the Sun, than which we have no viſible Object of more Force and Efficacy. And what can be more neceſſary to be done away, than that ſelfiſh Diſpoſition of Heart, which has no Reaſon either for its Love or Averſion, but the Appearance of Gain or Loſs to itſelf?</p>
               <p>THIS Article of the Love of God has been drawn out to a much greater length than was deſign'd, and 'tis pity any thing ſhould have been mixed with it that looks like Wrangling: But, as was before obſerved, the Advocates for <hi>Self-Intereſt</hi> have rais'd it ſo high, as to make it the only Principle of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not only among common Men, but the Apoſtles and Ambaſſadors from Heaven. They have like wiſe perplex'd the Matter by ſubſtituting <hi>Self-Love</hi> for <hi>Self-Intereſt,</hi> and ſo have render'd it an unfavourable thing to differ from them; ſince it is ſo natural to love ourſelves, and even to conſult our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. But they are to underſtand, that there is no difference but in this ſingle Point, <q rend="inline">"Whether God is to be lov'd <hi>principally</hi> for his ſake or our own."</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is not to be denied, that Rewards and Puniſhments are laid before us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that many of its Arguments are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to Hope and Fear: But Religion
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0039200600:341"/>
deſigns alſo that our Hopes and Fears ſhould have a juſt and reaſonable Foundation; in which caſe they are of great ſervice to us, as the Spur and the Bridle, to animate our Dulneſs, or reſtrain our Forwardneſs.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' Hope and Fear have their Place in Religion, they are not to have the higheſt Place. St. <hi>John</hi> hath aſſured us, that <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John iv.</note>
                  <hi>perfect Love caſteth out Fear:</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath very deciſively given Charity (that is, Love) the preference above all Gifts and Graces<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiii.</note>.</p>
               <p>BOTH Hope and Fear may be conſidered either as divine Virtues, or natural Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Qualities, or what other Term the Reader ſhall chuſe.</p>
               <p>THE Objects of our Hope and Fear are Pleaſure and Pain in the general. And tho' Fear ſerves as a Reſtraint upon our Actions, yet it ſerves alſo as an Inducement; the ſhunning of Pain being often as ſtrong a Motive, as the procuring of Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, 'tis chiefly with reference to Pleaſure and Pain in this Life, that our Hopes and Fears are awakened: ſo that our preſent Quiet or Security as to the next Life is very much owing to our Stupidity. And the Pain that we are principally afraid of in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0039200600:342"/>
this World, is the Cenſure of others, who we cannot but ſee will take the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty with our Character, that we take with theirs; and thus we paſs our few Days in Dread and Slavery: this certainly will be own'd by the polite Part of Mankind, and there is hardly the meaneſt Perſon but has his Fears and his Pride.</p>
               <p>WHAT is ſhameful in the Fear of Cenſure is the Exceſs of it, and when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced our Judges are ignorant. What is ſhameful in the Fear of Death, or bodily Pain, or Loſs of Goods, is when we are too much diſconcerted, and eſpecially when we are frightned out of our Virtue.</p>
               <p>WHEN Hope and Fear are directed to the next World, they muſt continue in ſuch a Station (with every thing that God has planted) as <hi>perfect Love</hi> ſhall aſſign them. We are told it caſteth out Fear, that is, any Apprehenſion about ourſelves; for by Fear is meant alſo Honour and Reverence, which can never be caſt out: And this divine Hope is founded on a Senſe of the infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not on <hi>Self-Love,</hi> for this were but Preſumption. We may ſee nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Love in ourſelves, and yet have a great Confidence in the divine Mercy. And we are never fit Objects of that Mercy, 'till we loſe our good Opinion of ourſelves, and ſee our own Inſufficiency and Corruption. <hi>For God reſiſteth the Proud.</hi>

But a very little Reflection may ſhew us, which of the two Cities or Elements can afford us moſt Pleaſure: for the higheſt Pleaſure is to love; and the higheſt Perfection is to love what is moſt excellent.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER Helps we can think of, to excite our Love to the Deity, whether it be the Conſideration of his Goodneſs or his Power, Hopes or Fears, Gratitude, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or any thing that can occur to a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Mind, ſhould all be made uſe of in their order, and conſpire to lead us to that indiſpenſible Duty; which tho' it be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallible Intereſt, is yet to be purſued chiefly as our Duty: otherwiſe we have neither the true Notion of Love nor Juſtice, nor even of our own Intereſt, but confuſedly jumble all three together, or perverſely give Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the preference, and ſet up ourſelves in the place of God, and conſequently fall into the Element of Trouble, or (at moſt) into a deluſive Quiet while it laſts.</p>

                  <p>THE Self-Love that's argued for by well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intention'd Perſons, as the Foundation of all Duties both in Morality and Religion, is that Self-Affection which Nature has planted in us: But all manner of Affection, and the Deſire of all manner of Rewards muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>IT ſeems fitteſt therefore to underſtand Self-Love (according to the moſt current acceptation) as the Sink of all Vices, or as a bad Tree, which, if the Branches are lopt off upon one ſide, will put forth new ones upon another, ſo long as <hi>the Ax is not laid to the Root.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Argument againſt cutting down <hi>what God has planted,</hi> has no place in this Idea of Self-Love; for God plants nothing that's ill: And therefore nothing that he has planted is to be deſtroyed in an abſolute Senſe; tho' ſeveral things are ſo to periſh, as to make way for what is more perfect. <hi>Meat</hi>

Our Saviour ſays, <hi>He that loſes his Life, ſhall find it:</hi> the Meaning is obvious. And thus Self Love, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Affection for ourſelves, may be conceived as a thing not to be extinguiſh'd, or loſt in a Phyſical Senſe, but ſwallow'd up by a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Principle, as a River is loſt in the Sea.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Pleaſure.</note>PLEASURE conſiſts in the Agreement of Objects with our Faculties: ſo to have agreeable Senſations or Perceptions, is to have Pleaſure. Reflections are alſo capable of giving Pleaſure, tho' ſainter.</p>
                  <p>IN the mere Senſation of Pleaſure there is neither Vice nor Virtue, Shame nor Praiſe; for we are but paſſive under the Impreſſion.</p>
                  <p>THE Love of Pleaſure and Self-Love are far from being convertible Terms. We love Pleaſure for our own ſake; and, if we are but pleas'd, we are indifferent what the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be; and we readily quit one, from the view of more Pleaſure in another: and all this is reaſonable, provided we do not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Limits of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>PLEASURE is often taken for the lower kinds of Gratification; <hi>A Man of Pleaſure:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>IT is from the different Pleaſures Men follow, that they are to be call'd <hi>childiſh, fantaſtick, brutal, diſhoneſt, impious</hi>; or the reverſe of all theſe. For, beſides the Pleaſures of the five Senſes, there are the Pleaſures of the Underſtanding, and the Pleaſures of the Heart, the Pleaſures of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and the Pleaſures of Practice; with an infinite Number of little Pleaſures depending on the animal Spirits, as Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, Diverſions, Mirth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are <hi>very good</hi> in their own order.</p>
                  <p>FALSE Pleaſures muſt be allowed to have a certain Reality in them, ſince they actually do pleaſe; but the Pleaſure is owing to a vitiated Taſte: for inſtance, the Delight in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other People's Defects, even when we have no deſign to exalt ourſelves.</p>

                  <p>THUS Men forego ſmall Pleaſures, or little Intereſts, for greater; or willingly ſuffer Pain from the Hopes of Pleaſure afterwards, or take their hazard of exceſſive Pain after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for a ſhort Pleaſure in the mean time: and it is not eaſy to calculate either the Degrees of the Intenſeneſs or the Duration. But it is enough to ſuppoſe in general, that 'tis the Proſpect of greater Intereſt that determines us to ſuch Changes.</p>
                  <p>THE right Notion of Intereſt, and the Purſuit of it, upon a deliberate Examination, is Prudence: for often Men are hurried on without any Conſideration at all, and often they are very confuſed in their Deliberations.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Ideas of Intereſt and Juſtice are diametrically oppoſite. Our Intereſt often ſuggeſts to keep what Juſtice would require us to give away.</p>
                  <p>YET nothing is our true Intereſt, but what is juſt; or nothing is really profitable, but what is honeſt.</p>

In Agility, it ſurpaſſes all Repreſentation; in transforming itſelf, it exceeds all the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſes; and in refining, goes beyond all the Art of Chymiſtry: There's no fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Depth, or piercing thro' the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

of its Abyſs. Here 'tis conceal'd from the moſt penetrating Eyes, and makes a thouſand inſenſible turnings and windings: Here 'tis often viſible to itſelf, and conceives and breeds up a vaſt number of Inclinations and Averſions unknown to itſelf; ſome of which are to monſtrous, that when they are brought forth, it does not know them, or cannot be prevail'd on to own them. From this obſcurity, with which 'tis overcaſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe the ridiculous Conceits that it has of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; hence proceed the Errors, Ignorance, the groſs and ſilly Miſtakes it entertains of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; hence it is, that it fancies thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions dead in it, which are only laid to ſleep, that it imagines it has laid aſide the Deſire of purſuing, when it does but reſt to take breath; and thinks it has loſt the Appetites, which it has only ſatisfied for the preſent. And yet this Obſcurity, thick as it is, to hide it from itſelf, hinders it not from ſeeing perfectly the things which are without itſelf; in which 'tis like our Eyes, which perceive all things, and are only blind with reſpect to themſelves. Indeed in its greateſt Concerns and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affairs, where the Violence of its Deſires ſummons all its Attention, it ſees, and feels, and hears, and imagines, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and penetrates, and foreſees every thing ſo well, that a Man would be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to believe, that every one of its Paſſions was quieted by a ſort of Magick peculiar to it. Nothing is ſo cloſe and ſtrong as its
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0039200600:351"/>
Engagements, which, in vain it attempts to break at the ſight of great and threatning Diſaſters. Yet ſometimes it effects that in a little time, and with little pains, which it could not effect in the courſe of many Years with all its Endeavours; from whence it may probably enough be concluded, that its Deſires are kindled by itſelf, rather than by the Beauty, or Merits of its Objects; that its own Palate gives them the value that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hances them, and the Gloſs that ſets them off; that itſelf is the thing it purſues, and its own Humour what it follows, when it follows the Objects that ſute its Humour. 'Tis made up of Contraricties, 'tis imperious and ſubmiſſive, ſincere and hypocritical, compaſſionate and cruel, timorous and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious: It puts on different Inclinations, according to the different Tempers that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and devote it ſometimes to Glory, ſometimes to Riches, and ſometimes to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; all which too it changes, as our Age, Fortune or Experience change: but as to itſelf, 'tis indifferent whether it has many or but one, becauſe it divides itſelf into many, and collects itſelf into one, as its Pleaſure or Neceſſity requires. 'Tis inconſtant not only from the Changes produc'd by foreign Cauſes, but from a thouſand others, that ſpring from itſelf; 'tis inconſtant from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, Levity, Love, Wearineſs, and Diſguſt; 'tis whimſical, and may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſometimes to labour with the utmoſt

Vehemence, and with incredible Pains to obtain thoſe things that are not only of no advantage, but are hurtful; which yet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it will, meerly becauſe it will. 'Tis fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical, and often ſets all its Application at work about the moſt frivolous Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; takes delight in the moſt inſipid things, and preſerves all its Haughtineſs in the moſt contemptible Circumſtances. It enters into all States and Conditions of Life: It lives in every place, it lives upon every thing, nay, it lives upon nothing: It makes itſelf eaſy either with the Enjoyment of things, or with the Want of them: It takes part with the People that make war upon it, engages in their Deſigns; and what is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, joins with them in hating itſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires its own Deſtruction, and works its own Ruin: In ſhort, its whole Care is to exiſt, and provided it does but exiſt, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be its own Enemy. We ought not therefore to be ſurpriz'd, to ſee it aſſociating itſelf with the moſt rigid Auſterity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring boldly in league with its Adverſary to deſtroy itſelf, becauſe at the ſame time that it loſes in one place, it gains in another. When we think it renounces its Pleaſure, it only ſuſpends or changes it; and when 'tis ſo conquer'd, that we fancy it entirely routed, we find it triumphing in its own defeat. Behold the true Picture of Self-Love! the whole Life of which is but one great and long Agitation: the Sea is a very ſenſible

                     </gap>ons and our Heart.</p>
                  <p>RELIGION further requires the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of other Practices, either ſuppoſed to be inſtituted by God, or appointed by thoſe to whom the Regulation of ſuch things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.</p>
                  <p>THE End of Religion is the ſame thing with the <hi>End of the Commandment,</hi> which is <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ALL external Practices of Religion are deſign'd for promoting that internal Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Mind, both with reſpect to God and our Neighbour, and from it they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive all their Value. And this Religion is often called a ſpiritual and new Life.</p>
                  <p>THAT which is called <hi>the Religion of a Country,</hi> with reſpect to Forms, Uſages and Opinions, reſembles the <hi>municipal</hi> Laws of a Country, which are peculiar to it. <q rend="inline">"And ſo (Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſays) Orthodoxy on the one ſide of the <hi>Pyrenees</hi> may be Hereſy on the other."</q> Whereas among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians there is properly but one Religion.</p>
                  <p>THE Chriſtian Religion therefore may be conſidered as a Body of Doctrine and Precepts delivered from Heaven, which Men ought to follow as the univerſal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0039200600:362"/>
and according to which they ought to form their particular Societies.</p>
                  <p>BUT there is this Difference between the Religion and the Laws of a Country, that a Man muſt ſubmit to theſe of neceſſity; but not always to the Religion: as an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> may diſſent ſafely from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHEN People talk of the Cruelties of Religion, Chriſtianity has nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for in that Charge. And when the Clergy are accuſed of Pride, the Accuſation lies properly againſt the defective Nature of Men.</p>
                  <p>MOST Men allow there is a Diſtinction between the End of Religion, and the Means; they allow alſo a Diſtinction among the Means themſelves, as to Weight or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: But the <hi>mortal</hi> Diſpute remains, what the weightieſt are; and the End is often forgot in the Controverſy.</p>
                  <p>THE End of Religion is therefore to be conſidered both as the Point to arrive at, and the principal Thing in the Affair.</p>
                  <p>SOME things may be called Parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well as Helps to it; as Faith, Prayer, Temperance, and whatſoever <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has ordered to be done and believed.</p>

PARTICULAR Forms of Religion, that is, ſuch things as are but the Inventions of Men, may be called Helps to it, but not Parts; no more than the Clothes are Parts of the Body, tho' they are of indiſpenſable uſe to it. And in Religion the very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of particular Modes comes to be a Duty, that, beſides their Uſefulneſs, there may be no offence given to the Society one adheres to. The Parallel between Religion and Clothes cannot be expected to run ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly.</p>
                  <p>'TIS with reference to religious Forms and Speculations, that Zeal (a good thing in itſelf) becomes both ridiculous and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, as no human Inventions are perfect, to a ſcornful Temper they appear more imperfect than they are.</p>

                  <p>THIS Philoſopher (after <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi>) conſidering the Force that Profit, or what appears profitable, has over Mankind; and deſigning to recommend Virtue to their earneſt Purſuit, labours to perſuade them that nothing is profitable but what is virtuous: he affirms, that it is only Wiſdom to love what is really good and uſeful; but that we have ſuch a Byaſs to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that if we ſhall place Virtue and Utility on different ſides, we ſhall of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence betake ourſelves to the ſide we think profitable. So <hi>Arrian</hi> deſigns in this Chapter concerning Friendſhip to inform our Judgment as to our Duties, and to give us a view of our innate Selfiſhneſs. The whole Chapter ſhould be read, and it will appear whether this good Heathen has been an Advocate for the intereſted Principle or not.</p>
                  <p>'TIS true, he ſays <hi>no Creature is ſo much reconcil'd to another, as to its own Profit</hi>; which no doubt is the Caſe with Men in the common State of Nature: But thoſe who
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0039200600:373"/>
own Chriſtianity, as they are ſtill more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of this Corruption, ſo they ſee a greater difficulty of getting free of it, for the Heart is corrupted as well as the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is darkened; and it was to this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Faculty that the <hi>Stoicks</hi> chiefly applied themſelves, thinking if the Underſtanding was rightly inform'd, all the work was done.</p>
                  <p>BUT it does not infer, that they thought Intereſt the chief Principle that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine Men, becauſe they pointed out where the true Intereſt lies; no more than the Scriptures can be brought to ſupport that Principle, becauſe in teaching Men the way to Happineſs, they ſometimes make uſe of Arguments from Hope and Fear.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſame manner, ſome great Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens have condeſcended to the Weakneſs of thoſe they were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to inſtruct. They knew that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is not perfect, nor ſuch at it ought to be, while Intereſt is the Motive; and they themſelves could be virtuous without regard to it: but they knew likewiſe the Diſorders of Human Nature, and that Profit was the chief Bait; and have therefore taken pains to ſhew that Virtue and Profit are inſeparable. But if we would judge of the Purity of their Sentiments, it muſt be from the Places where the Diſpoſitions of their own Hearts are mark'd. The following Words of <hi>Epic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus</hi>

                  <p>THE Love of Truth (conſidered morally) is the ſame with the Love of Juſtice. Thus the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Charity rejoiceth not in Iniquity, but rejoiceth in the Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ALL Truths are equal as to their Reality, but very unequal as to their Importance: and the Knowledge of the higheſt Truths, if it goes no farther than bare Speculation, is but Amuſement.</p>
                  <p>THE oppoſite things to Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are Falſhood, Error, Lyes, Deluſion; and the Mind takes pleaſure in the one ſide or the other, according to the Diſpoſition it is in.</p>
                  <p>THE greateſt Breach of Truth, or the worſt kind of Lying, conſiſts in the Intention to deceive or injure. A Lye that has no End to ſerve, is not very conceivable; but there are Ends which muſt be own'd to be very frivolous.</p>

                  <p>WE ſee alſo a Choice made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the former Chapter, <hi>rather to ſuffer Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon.</hi> We muſt ſuppoſe a Difference in the Pleaſures ſet before <hi>Moſes</hi> and JESUS CHRIST: it was but the Pleaſures of <hi>Egypt</hi> that were propoſed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and theſe he rejected.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0039200600:380"/>
and we are only told <hi>he had an Eye</hi> to it, as the Reward of his Choice.</p>
                  <p>IT is obſervable, that JESUS CHRIST is not included by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> as being in a ſuperior order.

                  <p>I need not run thro' all the Parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Saviour and <hi>Moſes:</hi> it will eaſily appear wherein it agrees and wherein it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, as all Compariſons do differ in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is not indeed in that Inſtance of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s rejecting the Pleaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that we find ſuch Proof of his Diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as of his Wiſdom; tho' ſtill there may be <hi>an Eye to a Recompence</hi> conſiſtent with the Love of Juſtice: and this Proſpect and Love of Reward may be ſo far from exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Love of Juſtice, that upon occaſions all views of Intereſt may be extinguiſhed in the ſame Perſon, and Juſtice remain the only Motive or Conſideration: as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s offering to ſuffer for his Brethren. Inferior Motives may certainly conſiſt with ſuperior ones, and the former may ſometimes give way, as they always ought to do when Order requires it. 'Tis oppoſite things only (like Fire and Water)

But neither wrong Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning nor right Reaſoning is <hi>Self-Love</hi>; nor can the Diſorders of any Faculty be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0039200600:384"/>
to the Faculty itſelf. Reaſon is ſure within its own Sphere, but is bewilder'd and loſt when it pretends to go father: And Self-Love is lawful within due Allowances, but unlawful when it violates Order.</p>
                  <p>To know this Order, and what we are deſign'd for, has been much at heart with ſome good Heathens.<q>
                        <l>Quid ſumus, &amp; quidnam victuri gigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, Ordo</l>
                        <l>Quis datus—</l>
                     </q> They were faithful to their Light: what a Change would Revelation have made in their Doctrine! How differently would the good <hi>Antoninus</hi> have writ, had he heard of the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of the preſent Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Nature! One Sett of the Deiſts borrow moſt of their Scheme from him. . . .</p>
                  <p>THE Violation of Order would never happen in a ſound Mind without ſome wrong Biaſs towards <hi>Self.</hi> . .The Heart ſeems to be firſt corrupted. . . . . . So that <hi>Intereſtedneſs</hi> may be call'd the Source of Diſorder. . . . . . Nor is <hi>Self-Love</hi> and <hi>Intereſtedneſs</hi> properly the ſame. . . . . . Much leſs is it true that has been affirm'd by ſome Perſons, <q rend="inline">"That all Love muſt be intereſted, not excepting the Love of God to his Creatures."</q> 'Tis but very few that are of this Opinion, and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0039200600:385"/>
the ancient <hi>Perſians</hi> had a quite different Notion of God, when they ſaid, <hi>He is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Good, and intirely diſintereſted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>DISINTERESTEDNESS may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the Foundation of that active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple call'd <hi>Charity.</hi> All Love (ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) is diſintereſted; the Love we bear to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is certainly ſo, as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerved, and ought to be the meaſure of our Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Neighbour. The Love of God is a higher Attainment.</p>
                  <p>THERE was one thing that gave a great Diſcouragement from this poor Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> That what is ſaid on the Love of God will be very inſipid to thoſe, who have felt ever ſo little of the thing, or are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch Authors as have wrote of it from their own Experience. But I have told all my Deſign in the Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. . . . . .</p>
                  <p>THO' the Enemies of Chriſtianity have taken advantage of ſome Expreſſions of the Clergy in favour of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> and the Sufficiency of Reaſon; yet neither of theſe Doctrines is eſpous'd by any Party in the groſs, but rather rejected by the greateſt number of all Parties; Papiſts, Proteſtants, and all the Branches of theſe laſt. <q rend="inline">"Be on your guard (ſays Dr. <hi>Evans</hi>) againſt Selfiſhneſs, or ſuch an Addictedneſs to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0039200600:386"/>
yourſelves, as ſhall confine your Regards within the narrow Circle of Self. Such a <hi>Self-Love</hi> is the main Principle of all the Evils and Diſorders in the World; it makes Men undutiful to God, and uſeleſs if not pernicious to thoſe about them."</q> And how finely has Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> of the Rolls Chapel expreſs'd himſelf againſt <hi>Self-Love</hi> in his Sermons! <hi>Evans</hi> ſays alſo of the Love of God, <q rend="inline">"That it is indeed <hi>the firſt and great Commandment:</hi> it is firſt in order of Nature, and in the Preeminence of the Object to which it relates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>AMONG the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Expreſſions are no leſs remarkable both againſt <hi>Self-Love,</hi> and for the pure Love of God. Citations might be produc'd in great plenty from Writers in all Ages. Thoſe who wrote the earlieſt, gave their Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to <hi>pure Love,</hi> and no doubt had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted more upon it, but that the Doctrine of <hi>Self-Love</hi> had not then ſet up its Horns. Theſe Words of <note n="*" place="bottom">There is another Reaſon why good Men are afflicted with temporal Evils, as in the Caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> that the Mind may be put to a Tryal, and diſcover the Force of its own Piety, or how much it loves God for nothing.</note>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> can hardly be forgot, <q rend="inline">"Habent aliam cauſam boniquare temporalibus affligantur malis, qualem habuit <hi>Job:</hi> ut ſibi-ipſi humanus animus ſit probatus &amp; cognitus, quanta virtute pietatis <hi>gratis</hi> Deum diligat."</q> As to <hi>Job,</hi> a Queſtion was indeed put by the Devil,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0039200600:387"/>
                     <hi>Does</hi> Job <hi>ſerve God for nought?</hi> But the following part of the Hiſtory ſufficiently ſhew'd <hi>Job</hi>'s Diſintereſtedneſs as well as his Patience.</p>
                  <p>. . . . No body can deny that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſiſts upon Rewards and Puniſhments, as Arguments drawn from our own Intereſt: but Intereſt ought not to juſtle out Duty, Juſtice, and Order; nor even to be preferr'd to theſe. <hi>Henry More</hi> had reaſon to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Maxim of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> odd as it looks, <hi>propter quod unumquodque eſt tale,</hi> &amp;c. for 'tis certain, that whatever is regarded chiefly for the ſake of another thing, is the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded of the two. But 'tis carefully to be remember'd, that the Scripture is accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the State of Mortals, and ſpeaks to the <hi>ſtronger</hi> and the <hi>weaker,</hi> to thoſe of better Diſpoſitions, and thoſe of worſe; yet <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſays to all, <hi>Be ye perfect,</hi> &amp;c. We muſt obſerve farther, that the Promiſes annex'd to our Duty are not given barely as an Incitement to it, but alſo to ſhew the Diſpoſitions we muſt be in, before we can attain to the Happineſs deſign'd for us; as for inſtance, before we can <hi>ſee God</hi> we muſt be <hi>pure in Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A modern Logician, Monſ. <hi>Crouſaz,</hi> ſays very well upon the different Diſpoſitions of People with reſpect to Virtue; 'tis to this purpoſe: <q rend="inline">"The bare Knowledge of Virtue
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0039200600:388"/>
determines one Perſon to cleave to it; another needs the Majeſty of a Lawgiver to be added; a third has need of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; a fourth of Threats; and a fifth of Blows."</q> Here is a Gradation of Virtue from the higheſt Form to the loweſt: the loweſt is very low, and the higheſt as high as Dr. <hi>More</hi> or the Biſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> wou'd demand. If Monſ. <hi>Crouſaz</hi> ſpeaks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times favourably of <hi>Self-Love</hi> (I mean the intereſted Principle) the like has happen'd to very good Perſons, even among the Clergy . . . . . . . which led me into that Criticiſm (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. XI.) and I'm not yet ſure if it ſhould ſtand: But it was owing to a Sermon of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Bull,</hi> which every body may ſee in print. 'Tis uneaſy to differ from a learned and good Man. But what ſhall one do when a greater number of learned and good Men are on the other ſide of the Queſtion? Here is another Biſhop of the ſame Church, Biſhop <hi>Lake,</hi> he ſays in his Sermon on <hi>Math.</hi> xxii. 27. <q rend="inline">"If there be any thing that may be lov'd jointly with God, it muſt not ſhare equally with God, but keep its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and receive our Love by a Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God. . . . . . Thus if we love God. . . . . . . . . we love him above all things, and we love him for himſelf; for <hi>that</hi> muſt needs follow, when we love him for no other thing, no not for our own ſelves, but are willing to hazard all, even ourſelves and all, for the Love of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0039200600:389"/>
him."</q> How far is Diſintereſtedneſs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in that Prayer of <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Give me, O Lord, a lively Faith, a firm Hope, and a lively Charity; a Love of Thee incomparably above the Love of myſelf, that I may love nothing to thy Diſpleaſure, but every thing in order to thy Satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Give me, O Lord, a Longing to be with Thee, not for avoiding the Calamities of this wretched World, nor ſo much for eſcaping the Pains of Purgatory, or thoſe of Hell, nor for attaining the Joys of Heaven with reſpect to my own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as purely for the Love of Thee.</p>
                     </note>Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s! . . . . . . I have often wonder'd how this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſhould give ſuch Alarm, as if the Quiet of the World was <hi>in danger</hi> from it. In the firſt place, it is not likely to be much practiſed, and then it can never be ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, as if People were forbid to take due care of themſelves; for if a Man did not ſo, he would be ill taken care of, as the World is. But in dealing with the World and Almighty God, the Rules are widely different: with him there is no uſe for Caution and Reſerve, but the more unlimited the Truſt and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, ſo much the greater the Safety and Happineſs. How agreeable is it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the Conſtitution of Things, and to find Happineſs reſult from the Obſervance of Order and Duty!</p>
                  <p>How Diſorder firſt enter'd into the World, is like to remain a Secret to Mankind, and it ſeems to be of little uſe to go into Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Inquiries about it; ſince whatever way the Queſtion were reſolved, it would make no alteration either in our Duty, or in the Nature of Things: Diſintereſtedneſs
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0039200600:390"/>
will always be our Dury, and our Duty will always be our Intereſt. But the Ideas of theſe two are different, however they may coincide in the Event; and in all Duties the Value will ever be meaſur'd by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>IN this Point even Chriſtians and Deiſts ſeem to be agreed, for Diſintereſtedneſs is a common Principle between them. And when any Chriſtians ſet up for Intereſtedneſs, the Deiſts make a handle of it to diſparage Chriſtianity: Again, when Chriſtians ſet up for the Sufficiency of Reaſon, the Deiſts are fond of their Expreſſions, and quote them to prove Chriſtianity an uſeleſs thing. . . . . . One great Difference between Chriſtianity and Deiſm is this, Chriſtianity repreſents human Nature in a ſtate of Diſorder, the Underſtanding limited and confus'd, the Paſſions tumultuous, and the Heart cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; and conſequently a neceſſity of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Aſſiſtance. Deiſm gives a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Repreſentation, as if every thing in Man was intire, and nothing ſo eaſy as the balancing of the Paſſions, and all the reſt. The difference between Chriſtianity and Deiſm in the point of Self-Denial follows of courſe: Chriſtians at leaſt profeſs it. And if the Deiſts alledge they are not in earneſt, and believe leſs than they pretend to; it can never come to a Demonſtration, and the Chriſtians may alledge, that the Deiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0039200600:391"/>
more than they own, the external and rational Evidences for Chriſtianity being ſo ſtrong. . . . . . . . Nor is Chriſtianity a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Vexation and Sorrow: it only ſets things before us as they are; that we may not be deceiv'd with falſe Appearances. What Situation of Fortune can be ſufficient to tranſport any Perſon, that reflects on the Preſent State of the World, and the Variety of Evils, both <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral?</hi> . . . . . . . . The World is <hi>felt</hi> to be what it is. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy is for the moſt part but Grimace.</p>
                  <p>BUT it is not ſo much the Inſufficiency of things, as the Injuſtice of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> that I had a mind to repreſent; that Principle by which a Man would make himſelf the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Univerſe! And I hope it will not be reckon'd too preſumptuous, if I endeavour this once to ſtate the Queſtion concerning <hi>Self-Love</hi> and the Love of God in ſuch a way, that all Chriſtians may (if poſſible) agree in it.</p>
                  <p>THE Queſtion here is not whether we are to love God, or whether it be our Intereſt to love him, or whether it be the Will and the Glory of God, that he ſhould be lov'd by all intelligent Creatures, (for in theſe things all Chriſtians are agreed;) but the Queſtion is, whether we are to love him from the Motive of his Perfection, or from that of our own Indigence; whether we are to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0039200600:392"/>
love him for the ſake of our own perſonal Advantage. bee uſe we cannot be happy without him, or becauſe he is indeed the moſt amiable Object, without conſidering our own Advantage whether we are to love him, becauſe it is juſt and right in itſelf, or becauſe our own Hopes and Fears deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us? If it be ſaid, we ought to love him both becauſe it is juſt in itſelf, and alſo becauſe it is our Intereſt; it may be anſwer'd, that as theſe Motives are not to be equal, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould love God and ourſelves equally) the Queſtion comes to be, whether Intereſt ſhall give place to Juſtice, or Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice give place to Intereſt? For however both theſe Motives may ſubſiſt together at firſt, yet the leſſer Motive will and ought to be ſwallow'd up by the greater. Now if we will but conſider as carefully the Juſtice there is in loving God, as the particular Profit that ſhall accrue to us by it, we ſhall at laſt be ſo penetrated with the Senſe of the Juſtice of the thing, as to reflect no more on our Profit; or if we do, we ſhall find that tho' Profit accompanies our Love, yet it is no longer worthy to be the Motive of it; and that as the leaſt By-view to Intereſt renders Love leſs perfect, ſo it is only that Love, which is without any ſuch View, that is abſolutely pure and perfect: becauſe in that Love, the Lover, forgetting himſelf, wholly rejoices only in the Beloved. And this (however ſome have call'd it a Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0039200600:393"/>
is no more than what the Nature of the thing requires, and what <hi>Cicero</hi> has even required in Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, if we ſtill love ourſelves with a diſtinct Love, independent on that of God, how ſhall we ever get ſo far out of the ſelfiſh State, as <hi>to love God with all our Heart and all our Strength?</hi> And yet this great Duty is acknowledged by all Chriſtians, and the Practice of it in the full and literal Meaning of the Words is the higheſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: for <hi>the End of the Commandment is Charity, and Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Whatever inferiour Motives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Imperfections, may ſtand in need of in the beginning, yet they muſt at laſt give way to a more perfect Principle: ſo that if any ſhall take upon them to condemn the pure diſintereſted Love of God, I ſee not how they can reconcile this with their own Acknowledgement, that He is to be loved with all our Heart.</p>
