            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE OF THE EDITOR.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Succeſs, which this Play has met with from the Town in the
Repreſentation, (to ſay nothing of the Reception it found from thoſe
Great Judges, to whom I have had the Honour of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in
Manuſcript;) has almoſt made the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of a Preface unneceſſary:
And therefore what I have to ſay, is deſign'd rather to wipe out a flying
Objection to two, than to labour at proving it the Production of
<hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare.</hi> It has been alledg'd as incredible, that ſuch a
Curioſity ſhould be ſtifled and loſt to the World for above a Century.
To This my Anſwer is ſhort; that tho' it never till now made its Appearance
on the Stage, yet one of the Manuſcript Copies, which I have, is of above
Sixty Years Standing, in the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Mr. <hi>Downes,</hi> the famous
Old Prompter; and, as I am credibly inform'd, was early in the
Poſſeſſion of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Mr. <hi>Betterton,</hi> and by Him
deſign'd to have been uſher'd into the World. What Accident prevented This
Purpoſe of his, I do not pretend to know: Or thro' what hands it had
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively paſs'd before that Period of Time. There is a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
(which I have from the Noble Perſon, who ſupply'd me with One of my Copies)
that it was given by our Author, as a Preſent of Value, to a Natural Daughter
of his, for whoſe Sake he wrote it, in the Time of his Retirement from the
Stage. Two other Copies I have, (one of which I was glad to purchaſe
<pb facs="tcp:0328001500:9"/> at a very good Rate,) which may not, perhaps, be quite ſo Old as
the Former; but One of Them is much more perfect, and has fewer Flaws and
Interruptions in the Senſe.</p>
            <p>Another Objection has been ſtarted, (which would carry much more
Weight with it, were it Fact;) that the Tale of this Play, being built upon a
Novel in <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> Chronology is againſt Us, and
<hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> could not be the Author. But it happens, that <hi>Don
Quixot</hi> was publiſh'd in the Year 1611, and <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare</hi> did
not dye till <hi>April</hi> 1616, a ſufficient Interval of Time for All that
We want granted.</p>
            <p>Others again, to depreciate the Affair, as they thought, have been
pleaſed to urge, that tho' the Play may have ſome Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of
<hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> yet the <hi>Colouring, Diction,</hi> and
<hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,</hi> come nearer to the Style and Manner of FLETCHER. This, I
think, is far from deſerving any Anſwer; I ſubmit it to the Determination
of better Judgments; tho' my Partiality for <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> makes me
wiſh, that Every Thing which is good, or pleaſing, in our Tongue, had been
owing to his Pen.</p>
            <p>As to the Performance of the reſpective <hi>Actors</hi>
concern'd in this Play, my applauding It here would be altogether
ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. The Publick has diſtinguiſh'd and given them a Praiſe,
much beyond Any that can flow from my Pen. But I have ſome particular
Acknowledgments to make to the <hi>Managers</hi> of this Company, for which I
am glad to embrace ſo fair an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>I came to Them at this Juncture as an <hi>Editor,</hi> not an
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> and have met with ſo much Candour, and handſome Treatment
from Them, that I am willing to believe, the Complaint, which has ſo commonly
obtain'd, of their Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and ill Behaviour to Writers, has been more
ſeverely urg'd, than it is juſtly grounded. They muſt certainly be too
good Judges of their own Intereſt, not to know that a Theatre cannot always
ſubſiſt on old Stock, but that the Town requires Novelty at their Hands.
On the other Hand, they muſt be ſo far Judges of their own Art and
Profeſſion, as to know that all the Compoſitions, which are offer'd them,
would never go down with Audiences of ſo nice and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a Taſte, as in
this Age frequent the Theatres. It would be very hard upon ſuch a Community,
where ſo many Intereſts are concern'd, and ſo much Merit in their
Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs allow'd, if they had not a Priviledge of refuſing ſome crude
Pieces, too imperfect for the Entertainment of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick I would not be
thought to inferr, that they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcourag'd what They might,
perhaps, afterwards wiſh they had receiv'd. They do not, I believe, ſet up
for ſuch a Conſtant <pb facs="tcp:0328001500:10"/> Infallibility. But if We do but fairly
conſider out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Four Thouſand Plays extant, how ſmall a Number
will now ſtand the Teſt: if We do but conſider too, how often a raw
Performance has been extoll'd by the Partiality of private Friendſhip; and
what a Clamour of Injury has been rais'd from that Quarter, upon ſuch
Performance meeting a Repulſe; we may pretty eaſily account for the Grounds
upon which they proceeded in diſcountenancing ſome Plays, and the harſh
Things that are thrown out upon their giving a Repulſe to others.</p>
            <p>But I ſhould beg Pardon for interfering in this Queſtion, in
which I am properly neither Party, nor Judge. I am only throwing out a private
Opinion, without Intereſt or Prejudice, and if I am right in the Notion,
<hi>Valeat quantum valere poteſt.</hi>

               <l>Theſe Moral Bards of good Queen <hi>Beſs</hi>'s Days!</l>
               <l>They write from Virtue's Laws, and think no further;</l>
               <l>But draw a Rape as dreadful as a Murther.</l>
               <l>You modern Wits, more deeply vers'd in Nature,</l>
               <l>Can tip the wink, to tell us, you know better;</l>

in Love with him. Now, you know, Neighbour, when Greatneſs rides Poſt after
a Man of my Years, 'tis both Prudence, and good Breeding, to let one's ſelf
be overtaken by it. And who can help all This? I profeſs, it was not my
