            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

profitable of all poems,</q> as Milton calls a Tragedy, was the diſtinguiſhing mark of a mind truly great, and endued with thoſe fine feelings which are the ornaments of even greatneſs itſelf. To this your innate partiality for every endeavour in the polite arts I muſt aſcribe it, that the following ſcenes met with an early approbation from your Lordſhip; an approbation that was at once the author's pride, and his ſtrongeſt aſſurance of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The Public have indeed very far outgone my moſt ſanguine hopes, in their reception of this piece: but now, my Lord, <hi>The Orphan</hi> has another ſevere trial to go through; he muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture into the world, unaſſiſted by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of repreſentation: he muſt enter your Lordſhip's cloſet, and there ſtand the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt accurate criticiſm. <hi>In Meti deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendat judicis aures.</hi> This cannot but be an alarming circumſtance to a writer fully conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his own inability; who has not been able entirely to pleaſe even his own taſte; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairs of ſatisfying others of a more exalted

reliſh in the arts, and therefore craves at your Lordſhip's hands that protection to his induſtry, which he is aware cannot be granted to his merit.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Letter to you from an Engliſh author will carry with it the appearance of correſponding with the enemy, not only as the two nations are at preſent involved in a difficult and important war, but alſo becauſe in many of your late writings you ſeem determined to live in a ſtate of hoſtility with the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation. Whenever we come in your way, <q>we are ferocious, we are iſlanders, we are the people whom your country has taught, we fall behind other nations in point of taſte and elegance of compoſition; the ſame cauſe that has witheld from us a genius for painting and muſic, has alſo deprived us of the true ſpirit of Tragedy; and, in ſhort, barbariſm ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails among us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding this vein of prejudice, which has diſcoloured almoſt all your <hi>fugitivepieces,</hi> there ſtill breathes throughout your writings ſuch a general ſpirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and zeal for the Honour of the Republic of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that I am inclined to imagine the author of the Engliſh Orphan of China (an obſcure iſlander) may ſtill addreſs you upon terms of amity and literary bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</p>
            <p>As I have attempted a Tragedy upon a ſubject that has exerciſed your excellent talents, and thus have dared to try my ſtrength in the Bow of ULYSSES, I hold my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſome fort accountable to M. DeVOLTAIRE for the departure I have made from his plan, and the ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a new fable of my own.</p>
            <p>My firſt propenſity to this ſtory was occaſioned by the remarks of an admirable critic<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hurd, in his Commentary upon Horace.</note> of our own. upon the

ORPHAN OF THE HOUSE OF CHAU, preſerved to us by the induſtrious and ſenſible P. DU HALDE, which, as our learned commentator obſerves, amidſt great wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and irregularity, has ſtill ſome traces of reſemblance to the beautiful models of antiquity. In my reflections upon this piece, I imagined I ſaw a blemiſh in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſaving the Orphan, by the tame reſignation of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other infant in his place; eſpecially when the ſubject af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded ſo fair an opportunity of touching the ſtrugglings of a parent, on ſo trying an occaſion. It therefore oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to me, if a fable could be framed, in which the Father and the two Young Men might be interwoven with probability and perſpicuity, and not embarraſſed with all the perplexities of a riddle, as, you know, is the caſe of the HERACLIUS of CORNEILLE, that then many ſituations might ariſe, in which ſome of the neareſt affections of the heart might be awakened: but even then I was too conſcious that it muſt be executed by a genius very different from myſelf.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of mind, ſir, I heard with pleaſure that M. De VOLTAIRE had produced at Paris his L'ORPHELIN DE LA CHINE: I ardently longed for a peruſal of the piece, expecting that ſuch a writer would certainly ſeize all the ſtriking incidents which might naturally grow out of ſo pregnant a ſtory, and that he would leave no ſource of paſſion unopened. I was in ſome ſort, but not wholly diſappointed: I ſaw M. De VOLTAIRE ruſhing into the midſt of things at once; opening his ſubject in an alarming manner; and, after the narrative relating to GENGISKAN is over, working up his firſt act like a poet indeed.</p>
            <p>Meum qui pectus inaniter angit Ut Magus.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the ſecond act, he again touches the paſſions with a maſter-hand; but, like a rower who
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0695900700:100"/>
has put forth all his ſtrength, and ſuddenly ſlackens his exertion, I ſaw, or imagined I ſaw, him give way all at once; the great tumult of the paſſions is over; the intereſt wears away; GENGISKAN talks politics; the tenderneſs of a mother, flying with all the ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of nature to the relief of her child, is thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cold unimpaſſioned narrative; the <hi>role pour Pamoureux</hi> muſt have its place, and the rough conqueror of a whole people muſt inſtantly become <hi>Le Chevalier</hi> GENGISKAN, as errant a lover as ever ſighed in the Thuilleries at Paris. Your own words, ſir, ſtrongly expreſſive of that manly and ſenſible taſte, which diſtinguiſhes you through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Europe, occurred to me upon this occaſion: <q>Quelle place pour la galanterie que le parricide &amp; l'inceſte, qui deſolent une famille, &amp; la contagion qui ravage un pais? Et quel exemple plus frapant du ridicule de notre theatre, &amp; du pouvoir de l'habitude, que Corneille d'un côté, qui fait dire à Théſée.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Quelque ravage affreux qu'étale ici la Peſte;</p>
            <p>
               <q>L'abſence aux vrais amans eſt encore plus funeſte. Et moi, qui, ſoixante ans apres lui, viens faire parler une vielle Jocaſte d'un viel amour: &amp; tout cela pour complaire au goût le plus fade &amp; le plus faux qui ait jamais corrompu la literature.</q> Indeed, ſir, GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GISKAN, in the very moment of overwhelming a whole nation, uſurping a crown, and maſſacring the royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, except one infant, whom he is in queſt of, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me exactly like the amorous OEDIPUS in the midſt of a deſtructive plague. <q>Nunc non erat his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</q>—How would that noble performance, that <hi>Chef d'oeuvre</hi> of your country, the ATHALIE of RACINE, have been defaced by the gallantry of an intrigue, if a tyrant had been introduced to make love to the wiſe of the high-prieſt? or if JOAD, entertaining a ſecret af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for ATHALIE, and being aſked what orders he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0695900700:101"/>
would give relating to the delivery of his country, ſhould anſwer, "aucune," none at all.—And yet this is the language of a northern conqueror, whining for a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darin's wife, who has no power of reſiſting, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no relation to the royal family, could not, by an intermarriage, ſtrengthen his intereſt in the crown But to you, ſir, who have told us that Love ſhould reign a very tyrant in Tragedy, or not appear there at all, being unfit for the ſecond place; to you, who have ſaid that NERO ſhould not hide himſelf behind a tapeſtry to overhear the converſation of his miſtreſs and his rival, what need I urge theſe remarks?—To fill up the long career of a tragedy with this epiſodic love muſt certainly have been the motive that led you into this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; an error I take the liberty to call it, becauſe I have obſerved it to be the hackneyed and ſtale ſtratagem, of many modern writers. Within the compaſs of my reading, there is hardly a bad man in any play, but he is in love with ſome very good woman: the ſcenes that paſs between them, I have always remarked, are found dull and unawakening by the audience, even though adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the graces of ſuch compoſition as yours, of which it is but juſtice to ſay, that it beſtows embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments upon every ſubject.</p>
            <p>For me, ſir, who only draw in crayons, who have no reſource to thoſe laſting colours of imagination with which you ſet off every thing; a writer ſuch as I am, ſir, could not preſume to ſupport that duplicity of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which runs through your piece. I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, by the powers of ſtyle, to ſuborn an audience in favour of thoſe ſecondary paſſages, from which their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention naturally revolts. A plainer and more ſimple method lay before me. I was neceſſitated to keep the main object as much as poſſible before the eye; and therefore it was that I took a ſurvey of my ſubject, in order to catch at every thing that ſeemed to me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0695900700:102"/>
with order and propriety from it. A ſcantineſs of intereſting buſineſs ſeemed to me a primary defect in the conſtruction of the French ORPHAN OF CHINA, and that I imagined had its ſource in the early date of your play. By beginning almoſt "gemino ab ovo," by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Orphan and the mandarine's ſon children in their cradles, it appeared to me that you had ſtripped yourſelf of two characters, which might be produced in an amiable light, ſo as to engage the affections of their auditors, not only for themſelves, but conſequently for thoſe alſo to whom they ſhould ſtand in any degree of relation. From this conduct I propoſed a further advantage, that of taking off the very obvious reſemblance to the ANDROMACHE, which now ſtrikes every body in your plan. This laſt remark I do not urge againſt acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and diſtant coincidencies of ſentiment, diction, or fable. Many of the Greek plays, we know, had a family-likeneſs, ſuch as an OEDIPUS, an ELECTRA, an IPHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENIA in TAURIS, in AULIS, a MEROPE, &amp;c. But what is a beauty in RACINE, ſeems in his great ſucceſſor to be a blemiſh. In the former, nothing depends on the life of ASTYANAX but what was very natural, the happineſs of the mother: in the latter, the fate of a kingdom is grafted upon the fortunes of an infant; and I aſk your own feelings, (for no body knows the human heart better) Whether an audience is likely to take any conſiderable intereſt in the deſtiny of a babe, who, when your Zamti has ſaved him, cannot produce any change, any revolution in the affairs of China? No, ſir; the conquered remain in the ſame abject ſtate of vaſſalage, and the preſervation of the infant king becomes therefore unintereſting and unimportant. He might die, ſir, in cutting his teeth, of the hooping cough, or any of the diſorders attendant on that tender age: whereas when the Orphan is grown up to maturity, when he is a moral agent in the piece, when a plan is laid for revenging
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0695900700:103"/>
himſelf on the deſtroyers of his family, it then becomes a more preſſing motive in the mandarine's mind; nay, it is almoſt his duty, in ſuch a caſe, to ſacrifice even his own offspring for the good of his country. In your ſtory, ſir, give me leave to ſay, I do not ſee what end can be anſwered by ZAMTI'S loyalty: his proſpect is at leaſt ſo diſtant, that it becomes almoſt chimerical. And therefore as hiſtory warrants an expulſion of the Tartars, as it was not upon the firſt inroad, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time and experience, that they learned to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate themſelves with the conquered, I had recourſe to my own preconceived notions. Whether I was partially attached to them, or whether my reaſonings upon your fable were juſt, you, ſir, and the public, will determine.</p>
            <p>You will perceive, ſir, in the Engliſh Orphan ſome occaſional inſertions of ſentiment from your elegant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. To uſe the expreſſion of the late Mr. DRYDEN, when he talks of BEN JOHNSON'S imitation of the ancients, you <hi>will often track me in your ſnow.</hi> For this I ſhall make no apology, either to the public or you: none to the public, becauſe they have applauded ſome ſtrokes for which I am indebted to you; and none certainly to you, becauſe you are well aware I have but followed the example of many admired writers; BOI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEAU, CORNEILLE, and RACINE, with you; and in England, MILTON, Mr. ADDISON, and Mr. POPE. It was finely ſaid by you, (I have read the ſtory, and take it upon truſt) when it was objected to the celebrated abbè METASTASIO; as a reproach, that he had frequent transfuſions of thought from your writings, <q>Ah! le cher volcur! il m'a bien embelli.</q> This talent of embelliſhing I do not pretend to; to avail myſelf of my reading, and to improve my own productions, is all I can pretend to; and that I flatter myſelf I have done, not only from you, but many of the writers of antiquity. If the authorities I have abovementioned were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, I could add another very bright example, the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0695900700:104"/>
example of M. De VOLTAIRE, whom I have often tracked, to uſe the ſame expreſſion again, in the <hi>ſnow of Shakeſpear.</hi> The ſnow of SHAKESPEAR is but a cold expreſſion; but perhaps it will be more agreeable to you, than a word of greater energy, that ſhould convey a full idea of the aſtoniſhing powers of that great man; for we iſlanders have remarked of late, that M. DeVoltaire has a particular ſatisfaction in deſcanting on the faults of the moſt wonderful genius that ever exiſted ſince HOMER; inſomuch that a very ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance tells me, that whenever you treat the Engliſh bard as a drunken ſavage in your <hi>avant propos,</hi> he always deems it a ſure prognoſtic that your play is the better for him.</p>
            <p>If the great ſcenes of SHAKESPEAR, ſir; if his boundleſs view of all nature, the lawn, the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the blaſted heath, mountains, and craggy rocks, with thunder and lightening on their brows; if theſe cannot ſtrike the imagination of M. De VOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIRE, how can I expect that the ſtudied regularity of my little ſhrubbery ſhould afford him any kind of pleaſure? To drop the metaphor, if the following tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy does not appear to you a MONSTROUS FARCE, it is all I can reaſonably expect. But whatever may be your opinion of it, I muſt beg that you will not make it the criterion by which you would decide concerning the taſte of the Engliſh nation, or the preſent ſtate of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature among us. What you have humbly ſaid of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in order to do honour to your nation, I can aſſert with truth of the author of the Engliſh ORPHAN, that he is one of the worſt poets now in this country. It is true, indeed, that the play has been received with uncommon applauſe; that ſo elegant a writer as the author of CREUSA and THE ROMAN FATHER was my critic and my friend; and that a great deal of very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular honour has been done me by many perſons of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0695900700:105"/>
firſt diſtinction. But, give me leave to ſay, they all know the faults of the piece, as well as if it had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed by the academy of <hi>Belles Lettres.</hi>—We are a generous nation, ſir; and the fainteſt approaches to merit, always meet here the warmeſt encouragement. One thing further I will aſſure you, in caſe you ſhould diſcover any traces of barbariſm in the ſtyle or fable, That if you had been preſent at the repreſentation, you would have ſeen a theatrical ſplendor conducted with a <hi>bienſcance</hi> unknown to the <hi>ſcene Francoiſe;</hi> the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the two Young Men would have made you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that they were not in your piece; and, though a weak ſtate of health deprived the play of ſo fine an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs as Mrs. CIBBER, you would have beheld in MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DANE a figure that would be an ornament to any ſtage in Europe, and you would have acknowleged that her Acting promiſes alſo to be the ſame: moreover, you would have ſeen a ZAMTI, whoſe exquiſite powers are capable of adding Pathos and Harmony even to our great SHAKESPEAR, and have already been the chief ſupport of ſome of your ſcenes upon the Engliſh ſtage.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, ſir, I beg you will not imagine that I have wrote this Tragedy in the fond hope of eclipſing ſo celebrated a writer as you are: I had an humbler motive, <hi>propter amorem quod to imitari aveo.</hi> Could I do that in any diſtant degree, it would very amply gratify the ambition of,</p>
