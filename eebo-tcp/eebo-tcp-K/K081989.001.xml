            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Letters, which I have herewith the Honour and Happineſs of
offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Public, were to me the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Gift of an elegant Friend of
the late Mr. SHENSTONE; of a Friend, who, like myſelf, loved his private
Virtues, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired his literary Abilities; and if the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ſuch a
Gift could have received En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancement, it was effectually derived from the
polite Manner wherein it was preſented. The following Extracts from ſome
Letters which accompanied them, will ſhew on what unreſerved Stipulations I
received them, and conſequently will (I hope) juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Uſe I make of
them. 
<floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>Extract the firſt, from a Letter dated 
<date>Nov. 9, 1775.</date>
                     </head>
                     <p>I herewith perform my Promiſe; as I found the Letters in my
Bureau, ſo I <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1173200201:4"/> ſend them to you, having neither Time nor
Spirits to look them over. They are now your own, with full Permiſſion to
apply them to any Purpoſe you think proper. I ſhall be glad if they
anſwer your Expectation. As <hi>ſome</hi> of them are thoſe of a Friend
ſo highly valued, they will, with <hi>you,</hi> I know, have Merit, and, I
hope, with the <hi>World.</hi> Of the latter, however, you are the beſt
Judge, and to your Deciſion I implicitly truſt them. I wiſh I could add
much more—the little I can, I will. PINDAR's Odes, VER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NON's Poems, (with
Obſervations by Mr. SHENSTONE) and the <hi>Gentle Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> were
<hi>all his,</hi> and as ſuch I hope you will accept them, in Remembrance of
him. Beſides the Letters which are tied up, the Parcel will contain Remarks
on MILTON's <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> Copies of the Ducheſs of SOMERSET's
Letters, (tranſcribed by Mr. SHENSTONE<note n="*" place="bottom"> Theſe
particular Letters (I ſhould preſume) will unqueſtionably be allowed to
deſerve the Character which Mr. SHENSTONE has prefixed to them in his
Tranſcript. It is as follows: 
<q>Copies of Letters from her Grace the Ducheſs Dowager of
SOMERSET (formerly Counteſs of <hi>Hertford)</hi> in which is diſcernible a
perfect Rectitude of Heart, Delicacy of Sentiment, and a truly-claſſic
Eaſe and Elegance of Style. There are many of them tinged with an Air of
Melancholy, thro' the Loſs of her only Son, Lord BEAUCHAMP.</q>
                        </note>) and 
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:1173200201:5"/> bound in Vellum, three looſe in the Leaves, (her Grace's
own Hand-Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) the <hi>Scotch</hi> Fragments, and a little Memorandum-Book,
over which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, you will like to ſpend Half an Hour, though it contains
nothing but <hi>Names.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText> Again, in a Letter, dated <hi>April</hi> 4, 1776. 
<floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>Have you ſeen, or heard from Mr. —? Have you yet got,
or are you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to get, that Letter of the Ducheſs of SOMERSET's which was
miſſing? I hope ſo—May Succeſs attend you! When the whole is
digeſted and reviſed, I have no Doubt of its being valuable.</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
            </p>
            <p>This explicit Diſcloſure of the liberal Means, by which
theſe Letters came into <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1173200201:6"/> my Hands, will, I preſume,
confirm the Authenticity of them, if they can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſtand in
Need of ſuch Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I ſay, <hi>if they can,</hi> for ſurely they
poſſeſs indubitable Marks of Originality, and require no adventitious
Evidence to ſupport them.</p>
            <p>Being thus poſſeſſed of ſuch an unlimited Power, my
firſt Care was to make the moſt cautious and delicate Uſe of it. I have
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſuppreſſed all entire Letters, as well as diſtinct
Paſſages, which appeared to contain Matter improper for public
Inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all, in Fact, which might be liable (in the ſlighteſt
Degree) to Miſconſtruction, either relative to the Writer, or the Party
addreſſed, or that might awaken unwelcome Feelings in the Breaſt of any
ſurviving Friend or Relation. I have likewiſe, where a Correſpondent is
introduced, or other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alluded to, who may be ſtill alive, (tho'
moſt of the Correſpondents, I am convinced, are dead) I have, I ſay, on
ſuch Occaſions, preſerved only Initials of the Names, in order that
public Curioſity ſhould be no <pb n="v" facs="tcp:1173200201:7"/> further gratified than
might be agreeable to the Parties concerned.</p>
            <p>After what I have advanced to prove the nice Precaution I have
taken, does this pleaſing, and, at the ſame Time, uſeful Undertaking of
mine ſtand in Need of an Apology?—I hope not.—I flatter myſelf,
the very Perſons, to whoſe Situations I have alluded in the foregoing
Paragraph, will confeſs, it does not. Not to ſay a Word of my own
Principles, I affirm that the bare Idea of a Publication, wherein Mr.
SHENSTONE's Talents are diſplayed, or wherein even his Name is mentioned,
would deter me from advancing one Step beyond the Bounds of Propriety and
Decorum.</p>
            <p>Yet, notwithſtanding all I have ſaid in Self-Juſtification,
I know there are ſome very peculiar (if I dared, I would call them
<hi>over-nice)</hi> Perſons, who alledge, that no private Letters ſhould be
made public, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of the Writers of ſuch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This I
will readily allow to be a good <hi>general</hi> Rule, but, like many others,
may <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1173200201:8"/> admit of an Exception, in particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and
theſe Inſtances are, where a <hi>proper Mode</hi> of introducing them to
the World is inviolably attended to. It is a well-known, and equally
uncontrovertible, Maxim, that Perſons of the higheſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
(eſpecially in the literary Walk) are poſſeſſed of the greateſt
Reſerve and Diffidence. Were the private Sentiments of ſuch to be with-held
from the Public, till their individual Conſent were obtained, what a Loſs
would it be to the Republic of Letters, and what an Injury to moral
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement! Any Perſon's general Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Ideas may be ſeen,
perhaps, in the reſpective public Profeſſion and Situation of Life, and
their general Intercourſe with Mankind; but the innate Senſations, the more
refined Emanations of the Mind, are alone diſcoverable in the private
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of Friendſhip. There can therefore be no unpardonable Liberty
in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coying,</hi> or even <hi>gently-compelling</hi> ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers
into public Notice; nor is it, by any Means, uncharitable to ſuppoſe, there
may be many, who would not be violently diſpleaſed to ſee their
Sentiments in Print, <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1173200201:9"/> however reluctant they might, and,
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ought to appear, if their particular Permiſſion were applied
for.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate and enforce this Poſition, let me be permitted
to aſk, if the Ducheſs of SOMERSET had been requeſted to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
her Letters to be made public, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe would have conſented? Probably
not—Yet what an Advocate would moral Virtue, pious Reſignation, and
genuine Piety have been deprived of, if thoſe exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Tranſcripts of
her Mind had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from public View!—It is, moreover, Matter of
great Doubt, whether we ſhould have been ſo well acquainted with the
Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of a SHENSTONE, had Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged the Wiſhes of his moſt
intimate Friends and Acquaintances, in prolonging ſo valuable a Life.</p>
            <p>Thus it has been, is, and will be, with moſt People of
diſtinguiſhed Abilities; their Excellencies muſt, in a Manner, be
<hi>forced</hi> into Day-light, or we ſhould loſe the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their
Precepts; they might otherwiſe be ſaid, like Miſers, to have a valuable
Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1173200201:10"/> buried with them, which ought, in common
Juſtice, to be left behind for the Advantage of Survivors.</p>
            <p>I have, I doubt, been too prolix; but the Fear of offending, or,
at leaſt, a Deſire to wipe off the Stain of ſuch an <hi>Intention,</hi>
has led me into it. I hope, I ſtand excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated; and now beg only to
conclude, with ſincere Thanks to the Gentleman, who po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely obliged me with
Letter XXVII. of the Ducheſs of SOMERSET's, and my moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Acknowledgements to the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Friend, who conferred on me the
ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Pleaſure of conveying to the Public ſome few more Excellencies of
that benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Man whoſe living Talents I admired, and whoſe Memory I
revere.</p>

            <p>I AM ſorry to put you to an Expence for a trifling Letter at this
Diſtance. It ſeems too, to give you leave to expect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
extraordinary, or uncommon. Whatever is ſo in my Letters, I am ſure, muſt
be on the bad Side. I may however have the greater Power to convince you, that
Diſtance is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to ſeparate you from my Thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1173200201:20"/>I am, at preſent, in a very refined State of
Indolence and Inactivity. Indeed I make little more Uſe of a Country Life,
than to live over again the Pleaſures of <hi>Oxford</hi> and your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
You might convey me a Letter full, would you be ſo exceedingly good as your
Promiſe. I am vaſtly ſelf-intereſted, for I write only in order to beg
a Letter from you, with very ſmall Hopes of your receiving much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
from mine.</p>
            <p>I ſhould here give you an Account of the Pleaſures we have had
at M—, but my Paper won't contain it. There was one only wanting,
<hi>pour le comble</hi>—you'll be the laſt to find it out—your
Company. I aim at render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Letters as odd and fantaſtical as
poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but when I write to a Perſon of your elegant character, my
Compliments degenerate into downright Truths, juſt (I was going to ſay) as
the Sun turns bad Wine to Vinegar; but downright Truths are ſometimes
valuable, though a Perſon of your Taſte might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect more
refined—at leaſt leſs obvious ones. Sometimes, however, Vinegar has
alſo <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1173200201:21"/> its Uſe, though to treat a Gentleman with it
entirely may well create a <hi>Nauſea.</hi> I fancy my poignant Simile grows
ſtale by this Time. I write to an Intimate, and a Man of Senſe, whoſe
Good-nature will forgive what his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may find fault with.</p>
            <p>I hope your Ring gives you all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Happineſs, however
fatal it may prove to female Ken. I ſuſpect to hear of you as the fineſt
Performer on the Spinnet in the World. Were I a Poet, I ſhould be highly
pleaſed to celebrate the admirable Conduct of your little Finger— 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Tui Pollicis Ictum,</hi>"</q> ſays
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>; vile Pedant that I am! who ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from the
Influence of Formality?</p>
            <p>I heard at <hi>Oxford</hi> of the Addition of the Side-Diamonds; I
gueſſed, leſt the Splendour ſhould be extinguiſhed by a greater,
<hi>où vous ſçavez.</hi> I want to ſee you exceedingly; you
are, I aſſure you, a vaſt Part of my Pleaſure at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as
POPE is in the Country; indeed, you might ſhare that Effect with Mr. POPE,
would you write. It is a Favour, for which I muſt grow importunate;
notwithſtanding <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1173200201:22"/> which, the Favours I have already
received, would make me uneaſy, were I not conſcious who beſtows
them.</p>
            <p>Of all the moral Virtues, Gratitude is ſure the moſt beautiful;
ſo far from betraying any Thing mean or ignoble in her Behaviour, ſhe has

            <p>I HAVE ſent the Patterns, though with far leſs Expedition than
you might expect from one ſo entirely yours. The truth is, I was ſenſible
how inſupportable the Tranſition muſt be from your Company to none at
all, ſo contrived to pay ſeveral Viſits immediately after I had left
M—. You'll gueſs how ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient a Mortification I found even thus.
To paſs from yours to the Company of dull Aunts and Couſins muſt needs
prove tedious, as the Reverſe would be agreeable.</p>
            <p>As to the Draughts, I am ſatisfied in what a ridiculous Light they
muſt appear; it was a Taſk I was very much unuſed to, and ſolicited
rather out of an officious Fondneſs to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for you, than any Skill I
was conſcious of in myſelf. I muſt beg Mr. G—'s Pardon for engaging
in a Work, wherein he is far <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1173200201:24"/> my Superior. Such as they are,
I beg you would believe they are the beſt I am capable of. I would rather
have my Judgment than Care cenſured, in any Thing I am employed in for you.
You'll be ſurprized to find them joined with a Paper ſcrawl'd over with
dull Poetry: however, I muſt confeſs, as I wrote it to pleaſe myſelf, I
ſent it, not without Hopes that it might, in an inferior Manner, pleaſe
you. One may ſometimes amuſe one's-ſelf with what one can't entirely
approve. As I can't flatter myſelf, your Judgment can excuſe, ſo I can't
apprehend your Good-nature will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me. To vindicate my Character to you,
as a Poet, I ſhall only join theſe alleviating Circumſtances; Firſt,
that nothing makes ſo aukward a Figure in Verſe (as well as in ſome other
Reſpects) as Sincerity. Secondly, that theſe Lines were wrote when I had no
great Flow of Spirits, namely, when I had juſt left M—, and you; but I
ſhall want your Patience elſewhere, ſo will ſay no more about
'em—only this—that I ſhould not have mentioned Miſs L—,
were I not perſuaded that, as you are entirely free from the other Faults of
your <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1173200201:25"/> Sex, ſo you are from that of not bearing to hear
another commended. It is a Sign of a great Want of Accompliſhments, when a
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is continually ſuſpicious of being rivalled; and, for that Part,
you may give every One many more than their Due, without the leaſt Danger of
being ſo.</p>
            <p>I could not help envying WHISTLER's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, when I came away;
I fancy your Lives have been a conſtant Round of Delights; I don't know any
Neighbourhood more likely to produce 'em. I could reconcile myſelf, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
pretty well to <hi>Harborough</hi>'s melancholy Scenes, were I not conſcious
of ſuch ſuperior Pleaſures, <hi>où vous ſçavez.</hi> You
might convey me a Letter full of them, but you'll, perhaps, think it an
impertinent Requeſt. I could ſet what Value you pleaſe on the Favour,
though the Pleaſure I can't pretend to limit.</p>
            <p>I muſt now break off my Letter in as auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark a Manner as I take
my Leave, which is likewiſe uſually moſt aukward, where I have moſt
Reſpect. I'll e'en lay aſide further Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1173200201:26"/> in this,

            <p>YOU expreſs ſo great a Concern for my Brother's Illneſs, that
not only common Civility, but Humanity, obliges me to acquaint you, that he is
upon the Recovery. His Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have thought him out of Danger theſe
three Weeks, as to his Fever, but are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of a Conſumption; to
prevent which, they have ordered him a Milk-Diet, as ſoon as 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1173200201:27"/> he gets into the Country, which he hopes to do, ſome Time
next Week. My Brother G— is with him. To make the Journey eaſy, they
propoſe to hire a Chaiſe, and make three or four Days of it.</p>
            <p>DICK has been ſo compaſſionate to write to me twice; the
Firſt was only to ſhew me he was alive; in the laſt Letter he ſeems to
have recovered his uſual Spirits, and ſays, he muſt be obliged to the
moſt deſpicable Creature in the Univerſe for the moſt valuable
Bleſſing in Life. He is quite determined to leave the Study of Phyſick,
and turn Friar, which I am delighted at, as I believe it will be conducive to
his Health.</p>
            <p>I think I have been very particular in my Account of my Brother,
which you would have received laſt Poſt, but that I was from Home when
yours came, and did not return till late on Saturday Night. I write this in the
greateſt Hurry, for Company waits for me to ſet out for S—: but I
muſt tell you, that I am very angry you ſhould think ſo meanly of me, as
to imagine I had not Generoſity enough to <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1173200201:28"/> ſend you an
Account of my Brother and your Friend, without the Bribe of a Compliment. Out
of Regard, however, I muſt pardon you.</p>

            <p>I THINK it would be inconſiſtent with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as well as
Good-manners, not to return you Thanks for the Pleaſures your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings have
given me; but I ſhall deſiſt from <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1173200201:29"/> declaring my
Sentiments of them, leſt you ſhould ſtile it Flattery. Writing has been
my conſtant Employ (when at Home) ever ſince you left us, and I hope you
could not expect them ſooner. I could not but think Fate doubly cruel, (when
to part us was as much as we <hi>here</hi> could bear with Decency) to embroil
us ſtill more by the Hurt of the Leg, which I am glad to hear is got
well.</p>
            <p>With you fled all Life and Spirit from A—; a total Eclipſe
ſucceeded you, and the Sun will ſhine no more till your <hi>bright
Influence</hi> diſpels the Cloud. Company and Fruit come in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but all
in vain, for nothing has any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, but the Writings of him who cauſed
the Malady. You have ſhone ſo much to the Prejudice of our Neighbours, that
it is with Difficulty we behave with tolerable Decorum. We drink your Health as
conſtant as Appetite (or rather, Cuſtom) calls to Table, for nothing has
any Taſte, except the Glaſs, in which you are named.</p>
            <p>We ſent <hi>Tom Thumb</hi>'s Performance (I think in my Heart it
is Nonſenſenſe) to Mr. —, who <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1173200201:30"/> read it, called
him <hi>naſty Dog,</hi> and put it in his Pocket. Whether it will be a
Spit-Cat, or dumb Madneſs, I don't know; but I am ſure the bottled
Small-Beer was very briſk laſt <hi>Sunday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Auguſt</hi> 25th we date our Miſery; no Smile ſeen,
or Laugh heard ſince, till laſt Night.—What could cauſe one
then?—Why, Mr. SHENSTONE, who had been dumb ſo long, ſpoke then, and
who can hear him without being pleaſed? It is meet and right, as well as
highly pleaſing to Mrs. MARY, that you ſhould reſpect Mr. A—, who,
I believe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſpend his laſt Breath in your Praiſe, but he'll
make your Name glorious. Nothing could give him more Pleaſure than you have
done, except a Preſent of Lawn-Sleeves. As to the Scheme you mention, I dare
not bid you hope, but I will venture to bid you not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, on a
Preſumption that your Rhetorick can never fail of Succeſs.</p>
            <p>I can't prevail with my Siſters for a Letter a-piece. One ſays,
that you ſhall be the next Gentleman ſhe writes to. Mrs. A— ſays,
tho' <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1173200201:31"/> you cut off your Hair, ſhe believes your Ears will
remain, and wiſhes nothing ſo much as an Opportunity to pinch 'em. Miſs
K— ſays, ſhe has already ſuffered too much by <hi>that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
Love,</hi> ever to engage with Mankind more, not even Mr. SHENSTONE; but cannot
bear that Miſs D— ſhould be ſo happy. S— ſays, ſhe would
make a handſome Speech, but cannot, and therefore ſends you <hi>only
Service.</hi> My Brother deſires his Compliments, and ſays, he can't fix a
Time for ſeeing <hi>the Leaſowes,</hi> but deſigns to be at
<hi>Broom</hi> with your Brother, in Three Weeks Time. So here you have <hi>the
Sayings of the A—ians.</hi> But I have not done yet, till I have been a
little more troubleſome.</p>
            <p>Note. If I did not know you to be a good Judge of Mankind, and had
not experienced your Good-nature, (which inclines you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Foibles
of the <hi>weaker Veſſel)</hi> together with the Hopes, that, for the Sake
of ſome happy Favourite, you would not expoſe the Sex, I ſhould not have
truſted you with my Nonſenſe. This concludes, therefore, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
one Favour, which is, that you would <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1173200201:32"/> burn this, and that

            <p>ON a Time, as 'tis reported, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were in Labour; when,
after a long Courſe of Pains and Inquietudes, they made a ſhift to produce
that puny Animal, a Mouſe. <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1173200201:33"/> Now that very individual
Mouſe, according to the myſterious and figurative Import of Types and
Shadows, was the perfect Image and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of this mine Epiſtle. A
groveling, ſtarveling, inſignificant Production, conceived with much
Difficulty, and tranſmitted to you with Confuſion of Face. In ſhort, you
may look upon it as the noble Booty you have taken, by baiting your
<hi>Trap</hi> ſo artfully with Praiſe and Compliment, about two or three
Months ago. True it is, that, conſidering the Politeneſs and Complaiſance
of your obliging Letter, my Behaviour ſince muſt appear the moſt
<hi>unknightly</hi> of all Proceedings, But your Packet did not arrive till
three Weeks after it was ſent; ſo you will excuſe my Silence till the Day
after I received it, and whatever was <hi>more</hi> than that, I freely
acknowledge, came of Sin. However, you will, upon Confeſſion, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me,
as you expect Pardon from your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, ſhould the Benedictines and
Friars get a Footing in this Iſland, which I find your Brother is
endeavouring to prevent.</p>
            <p>I can be no longer ludicrous on this laſt Article. I am too
ſeriouſly concerned for his <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1173200201:34"/> Safety; yet I don't fear
but the Rebels will be defeated, and, it may be, all Danger over in leſs than
a Fortnight. But General WADE's Behaviour, loitering ſo long at
<hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes me. I was at <hi>Birmingham</hi> on
<hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning, from whence I ſaw the Remains of LIGONIER's
Horſe march with vaſt Spirits and Alacrity. They wiſh to have, what they
call, the <hi>Refuſal</hi> of the <hi>Highlanders.</hi> They are Men of
experienced Bravery, and fought like Furies at the Battle of <hi>Fontenoy.</hi>
May they do ſo now, and with better Succeſs!</p>
            <p>B— told me, your Brother would borrow my Piſtols. At that
Time, ſuppoſing him in Jeſt, I ſent him no very ſerious Anſwer. I
now think it incumbent on me to ſay, that I would lend them him with all my
Heart, but that one of them is broke in the Stock, and cannot be fired with
Safety till it is ſtocked afreſh. Perhaps he might recollect it was ſo
when I was at A—.</p>
            <p>We have been beſt Part of a Week at <hi>Litchfield,</hi> where we
lived like Chickens in a Pen, confined and crammed, and where we 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1173200201:35"/> ſerved God after the Manner of Popes and
Cardinals.—I only allude to Cathedral Service. Mr. and Mrs. D—
ſeemed quite diſpoſed to entertain us agreeably. The Son and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to ſay the leaſt, appeared much more indifferent in that Particular. 
<q rend="inline">"Theſe,"</q> as SHAKESPEARE ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"are certainly better Chriſtians, or elſe, are
worſe than we."</q>
            </p>
            <p>You have eſcaped me at <hi>Birmingham,</hi> by concealing the Time
of your Viſit. Surely, you will come over to <hi>Broom,</hi> ere it be long,
and give me my Revenge.</p>
            <p>Tell Mrs. A—, my Ears make great Shoots, and ſuch as may
tempt her Hand egregiouſly: but if I <hi>am</hi> metamorphoſed into an
Aſs entirely, I will come and ſerenade her in a Morning, when ſhe has
been up late the Night before.</p>
            <p>I beg my Compliments to all Friends. I muſt not make my Letter

            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE ſeveral Times examined myſelf, to find out what can
authorize or qualify me to write to Poets and Men of Letters. Upon ſtrict
Enquiry, I am ſenſible, that nothing I am poſſeſſed of, can entitle
me to it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Vanity and Selfiſhneſs could ſpur 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1173200201:37"/> me on to this Impertinence; Vanity, in being addreſſed
by a Man of your Capacity and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the World, and Selfiſhneſs, as I
am ſure to be a Gainer by your Correſpondence. I muſt, however, tell you,
the Epithets of art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, polite, and witty, I have no Right to. In theſe
Reſpects, I am an Heroine of your own making, but I attribute all this to the
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that great and generous Mind of your own, and in whoſe
Nature it is to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you ſee in others what you really poſſeſs
yourſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble you with a Detail of the Frights, Fears, and
dreadful Apprehenſions, almoſt every body has been under, concerning the
Devil, the Pope, and the Pretender; 'tis my good Fortune to have more of that
ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Ingredient, called Hope, than that of the deſtructive one,
called Fear, in my Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which has prevented my ſuffering ſo much
upon the Occaſion, as the reſt of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. For my own Part, I had
but one Fear, which was that of my Brother's march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but I was ſoon made
eaſy in that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1173200201:38"/> when I found the
<hi>Duke</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Duke of CUMBERLAND, ſecond Son to King
GEORGE the Second, who headed the Forces againſt the Rebels.</note> had no
Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for, nor would accept of, the new-raiſed Regiments. All the
neighbouring Gentlemen, who had not Commiſſions, went Volunteers in Captain
WHITMORE's Company, but are all come Home again, and begin to think they have
been upon a Don QUIXOTE Expedition, or have done like the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and his Forty-thouſand.</p>
            <p>All the Females are turned Politicians, except myſelf. I
beſtowed two Minutes and an half in conſidering whether I ſhould affect
to appear one or not. In the firſt Minute, my Thoughts ſuggeſted to me,
that there never would be a Parliament of Women; in the ſecond, I was
convinced, if that ſhould happen, it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible I ſhould
ever have a Seat in the Houſe; and the laſt Half-minute confirmed me in my
Reſolution, not to meddle with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics, which, I imagine, was never
deſigned a Province for Women. I ſhall therefore be content till they act
in their proper Sphere, <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1173200201:39"/> and Ribbons, and Fans, (which are
better adapted to my Capacity) are again their Theme.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay, as to neighbouring Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences? Your Friend,
Mr. A—, is very well, and often talks of you. He told me, laſt Time I
was in his Company, he deſigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Pleaſure of calling on you
in his Way to <hi>B—,</hi> early in the Spring. Meeting with
<hi>bright</hi> B— the other Day, I deſired him to ſtir up his
Muſe, to <hi>whip</hi> her, and <hi>laſh</hi> her, and put forth
ſomething upon the Times. A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who ſat by, replied, 
<q rend="inline">"Perhaps he may ruin himſelf in Whip-cord, before
he rouſes her."</q> The <hi>Brobdignags</hi> go on with their Knotting, as
uſual; but I don't find that your <hi>favourite</hi> Miſs D—
deſigns you any for a Waiſtcoat.</p>
            <p>It was not in my Power to give you more Notice of my Viſit to
<hi>Birmingham</hi> than I did, as the Time was not fixed above ſix Days
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſet out, in which Time my Brother went to <hi>B—,</hi> and
deſired Mr. D— to let you know, when he ſaw you, (which he ſaid
would be in a Day or two) you would think you had <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1173200201:40"/> Revenge
enough, if you knew how I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. At laſt, <hi>I ſighed within
myſelf,</hi> and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"Surely, the Favour is more than I can
merit."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now <hi>cry aloud,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Wo unto them</hi>
that forget their Promiſe, for therein is their Fidelity called in
Queſtion!—<hi>Wo unto them</hi> that eraſe out of their Letters what
they had written, for thereby they injure the Brain of <hi>her</hi> that would
find it out!—<hi>Wo unto them</hi> that are three Months in anſwering a
Letter, for ſurely it muſt tire the Patience of <hi>her,</hi> who is, all
that Time, in Expectation!—<hi>Woful Truths!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>S— <hi>the Valiant</hi> deſires his Compliments, and thanks
you for the Offer of your Piſtols, which Favour he never aſked, as he did
not imagine they ſhould fight with Piſtols. He has been at Home this Month
recruiting. I don't doubt but the <hi>Shropſhire Fuſileers</hi> will make a
great Figure in military Hiſtory—at leaſt, in the <hi>Prints.</hi>
The tender, the wild, the grave, and the mild, all lump their Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1173200201:41"/>By the Time you come to this Place, (which,

            <p>IT can't poſſibly be otherwiſe, than that I ſhall ſoon
arrive at the Pinnacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Vanity, in full Perſuaſion of the
juſt and deſerved Encomiums on my Letters. In the Name of all that's
ſincere and honeſt, let me prevail with you to leave off Flattery, and act
the Plain-Dealer; and let it ſuffice, when I tell you, that the grand
Compliment of all is, that you think my Letters worthy an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which
alone is ſufficient to feed my Vanity.</p>
            <p>Now, leſt you ſhould not immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the fatal
Conſequences, that may attend Flattery, from a Perſon one may chance to
have a good Opinion of, imagine that you ſee me intoxicated to the greateſt
Degree that weak Woman is capable of; in order to which, <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1173200201:43"/>
you are to ſuppoſe that I have taken it into my Head, that the Houſe I
live in, is not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed with Ornaments and Decorations fit for me to
inhabit; that the Meat I eat is too coarſe for my delicate Conſtitution,
and Orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans alone fit for my Palate; that the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of my own
Family is quite deſpicable; my Neighbours not worth my Notice; that the Air
is not pure enough for me to breathe; in fine, that I am a <hi>celeſtial
Creature,</hi> far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the Race of Mortals on Earth. And, ſhould
this happen, you muſt then ſmite your Breaſt, and ſay, 
<q rend="inline">"Alas! theſe are the Effects of
Flattery!—Which ſhall deter me from the Practice of it upon Womankind
for the future."</q> I know 'tis a received Maxim with moſt Men, that no
Woman can be pleaſed without Flattery; but why might there not be an
Exception to this Rule? If my Letters are polite, 'tis what I never deſigned;
nor do I think you could poſſibly expect they ſhould be ſo, from a
little Garret, in a Corner of a Houſe, in a Corner of the World; and from one
who has nothing more to boaſt of, than the common Gifts of Nature, without
any other <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1173200201:44"/> Aſſiſtance than what proceeds from her
Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid <hi>Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to your Diſpute with Mr. B—, 'tis ſo like that between
the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> that I fancy it won't be determined
ſoon. For my own Part, tho' the Fighters have done little, I am inclined to
think the Writers have done leſs; for, as yet, I have not ſeen one Line in
the poetical Way, but what a B— may rival; and as to hiſtorical Facts,
I think they hang much upon Uncertainties. As it probably will be demanded of
every true Engliſhman, what he has done in Defence, or to the Honour of his
Country, I would fain know, if you are provided with an hundred Pages to throw

            <p>We are going to have ſome new Neighbours at <hi>W—d</hi>;
they are Siſters in Law to old Mrs. D—T; perhaps, as compleat a Pair of
old Maids as <hi>England</hi> can produce. The youngeſt is paſt Sixty, and
yet the Lungs of of the eldeſt are ſo good, that I'll be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſhe ſhall harangue ten Hours together, <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1173200201:45"/> upon the
Subject of Matrimony. She will ſcarce allow St. PAUL in the Right, when he
ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"They that marry do well;"</q> but is thoroughly
perſuaded of the Truth of his next Aſſertion, 
<q rend="inline">"They which don't marry do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter."</q> The
youngeſt is not ſo fluent with her Tongue, but ſhe, like the Welchman's
Owl, <hi>pays it off with thinking.</hi> I fancy we ſhall be able, in a
little Time, to furniſh out a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Society of old Maids, whereof
Mrs. L— (which is the Name of one of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Ladies) ſhall
be Lady-Preſident.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Amazonian Mrs.</hi> A— will not own that ſhe envies
Mrs. M—; but I have a great Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that ſhe intends to rival
JENNY CAME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RON, being equally fond of Wiſdom, to which I may add, ſome
Ambition to out-ſhine her in the Field. She has practiſed frequently on one
or other of the Family this Winter, by which Means it has been my Fate, more
than once, to lye in Honour's Truckle-bed. I believe ſhe deſigns to do
great Feats in War this Spring.</p>
            <p>I am vaſtly pleaſed with the Converſation of your Tenants, and
laughed immoderately <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1173200201:46"/> when I came to JOHN W—R's
Witticiſm. I don't intend to appear in Print, till I am well aſſured I
ſhall rival Mrs. — <hi>(A. P.)</hi> with her COPE, WADE, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Mr. PITT has reſigned his Poſt in the Army, and recommended one
of his Nephews in his Room; not Mr. B—, I believe, for I don't hear that
he intends <hi>to boil his Lobſter.</hi>—I love a genteel Phraſe.
Your Brother was here laſt Week, but I could not prevail with him to ſing
<hi>Polly Willis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That you may not think a Word of yours falls to the Ground, I muſt
tell you that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered your Meſſage to Mr. A—; at which, a
Mixture of Joy and Gratitude appeared in his Countenance; and being inclined to
believe it (and perhaps too complaiſant to call in Queſtion my Veracity)
did not inſiſt upon my Oath. He told me, he had, before this Time, done
himſelf that Pleaſure, had not Illneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him; but, if he lives,
he intends to ſee you this next enſuing Summer. I have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dreadful
Apprehenſions of his drawing near the Time of his Diſſolution, and great
Reaſon I <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1173200201:47"/> had, you'll ſay, when I tell you, that for
ſix Weeks he had not Spirits to ſqueeze <hi>his dear</hi> MOLLY by the
Hand. He has taken great Pains for upwards of thirty Years, to inſtruct and
improve his little Flock; yet (ſuch is the Perverſeneſs of the People,
and the Corruption of their Morals) that after a Sermon of half an Hour long, I
fear he had little Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had made any great Alteration in
their favourite Tenets.</p>
            <p>I hope you are convinced, that the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of having a female
Correſpondent, is to be peſtered with Nonſenſe, and the Return of a
very few Letters lets you into the Knowledge of the Materials wherewith a

but as the Joy and Pride of my Heart withers in his Grave, my Mind 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1173200201:49"/> is continually haunting thoſe Manſions of the Dead,
and is but too inattentive to what paſſes in a World, where I have ſtill
Duties and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, which I ought to be, and, I hope, I may truly ſay, I
am thankful for. I am ſure my Affection for my Lord HERTFORD, and Solicitude
for his Welfare, are ſincere; ſince, if I know my own Heart, I would not
deliberate a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lay down my Life for his Service. Lady BETTY and Sir
HUGH SMITHSON, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are juſtly dear to me; and I ſtill feel
the Bonds of tender Friendſhip: but I enjoy all theſe Bleſſings with
Trembling and Anxiety; for, after my dear BEAUCHAMP, what human Things can
appear permanent? Youth, Beauty, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Health, were not ſufficient to
ſave him from the Hand of Death! And who then can think themſelves
ſecure? Theſe are the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Conſiderations, which generally

            <p>I MUST certainly ſtand in a very bad Light, if, after ſo many
Favours and Obligations conferred on me, I ſhould be ſo idle, as not to
attempt to ſhew my Gratitude. But how can this be done? Where is the Pen that

Thanks, or that Praiſe begin, that ne'er can end?—But hold—He

Pride in following him. I ſhall only ſay, all that's agreeable is to be

            </opener>
            <p>I CAN no longer forbear telling you, that you have in your laſt,
obliged me more than by any one Action of your whole Life, and for which I
could almoſt call you Friend; (which, I aſſure you, is the higheſt
Appellation I can beſtow) for I muſt tell you, that no one yet ever
commenced a Friend of mine, till they had corrected me of ſome Fault,
Failing, or Error; and tho' I've long ſince been taught, that I ought not to
make a Friend of any but my own Sex, together with other Particulars parallel
to that, yet I cannot but think it a friendly Act, and as ſuch eſteem it.
For my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1173200201:54"/> let me ſay, that I am not ſo
obſtinate as to perſiſt in an Error for the Sake of ſupporting a wrong
Judgment; and had I diſcovered Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to diſpute Superiority with you in
any Reſpect, I ſhould have thought you little wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of my
Correſpondence; inſtead of which, I allow you to excel, much beyond
myſelf, in all Pre-eminence.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed any farther, let me clear Mrs. A— from the
<hi>Aſperſion</hi> her Judgment ſeems to lie under in this Affair,
otherwiſe I ſhall appear to be afraid of the Cenſure it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. Know
then, 'twas I choſe her Shape; and, peradventure, the better to ſerve my
own Purpoſes; for how know you, but I intended to make a Letter-Carrier of
her, (as they do in <hi>Babylon, Aleppo,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies)</hi>
and by that Means to accommodate myſelf with a ſwifter Meſſenger than
the Poſt? And as I knew her Inclination, when a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I
concluded, after Tranſmigration, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct would then as naturally incline
her to frequent VIRGIL<hi>'s Grove.</hi> How unnatural ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Shape may
appear to the Grove, I muſt tell you, I could produce ſome Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties 
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1173200201:55"/> on my Side, excluſive of thoſe you have mentioned; but
I am not about to do this, for, as you ſeem to diſallow it, I readily give
it up, and anſwer, 
<q rend="inline">"True, O King!"</q>—Nay, I think to be in the
Wrong, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in ſuch an ingenious, humane, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Manner
by you, more than equals being in the Right. I believe too, 'twill be for your
Intereſt, that ſhe remain in her own Shape, for ſome Time, as her Fingers
are employed in knotting Fringe for you, ſo you find you have no Occaſion
to buy; 'twill be ready be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Seaſon for wearing it comes.</p>
            <p>Marvel not that I don't admit your next Aſſertion, maugre all
the Forces you can raiſe, nay, tho' the whole nine Muſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
againſt me, I'll be abſolute for once. I am as tenacious of my Prerogatives
as any of my Sex, nor do I think I have been guilty of an Infringement in what
I have ſaid. I am neither ſo inſenſible of Favours as not to
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover 'em, nor am I ſo proud, or ſo prudiſh, as not to acknowledge
'em. Surely, you have dealt with none but the laſt-mentioned Sort of the Sex,
that you are ſo alarmed at what I <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1173200201:56"/> have ſaid. But no
more of this—I now enter a Caveat to the Subject.</p>
            <p>Mr. A— is much pleaſed with your kind Remembrance of him. He
made an excellent <hi>Hare-Chaſe</hi> Preachment on the
<hi>Thankſgiving-Day</hi>; for he told us all the Doublings and Turnings
<hi>the Pretender</hi> and his Party made from their firſt Effort to their
Defeat. He has got his Brother with him, a Man, whoſe Aſpect, at one View,
diſcovers to you the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility of his Mind. I do not yet know in what
Capacity he is to act, but am a little afraid 'twill prove that of a Servant,
which will be ſimilar to P—Y's Generoſity.</p>
            <p>There was a droll Scene the other Day, at <hi>W—d,</hi>
between bright B—Y, and old Mrs. D—T's Servant, who was ſent to
aſk him to Dinner. The Meſſage delivered, B—Y nodded his Head, and
replied, 
<q rend="inline">"I conno' come."</q> The Servant, not content with
this, followed, pulled him by the Sleeve, and intreated him; upon which he
reſponſed, 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>I conno' come, nor I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no' come.</hi>"</q> At
this, the Man retreated, much chagrin'd, thinking, no doubt, his Miſtreſs 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1173200201:57"/> ſlighted, that his own Pocket had loſt a
<hi>Chance,</hi> and nothing had been befriended—but the Sir-Loin. It was
great Glee to the Spectators, and, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> there was a numerous
Audience.</p>
            <p>You have certainly added Beauty as well as Gentility to the Place,
by deſtroying thoſe Hedges; for I think there can ſcarce be a Hedge near
you, that does not hide a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Beauties; and as to the Horſe-Pond, it
diſturbed me greatly when I was there. Has Monſieur <hi>Snuff-Box</hi>
ſent your Buſts, and will your Elegies ever be printed? Lord DUDLEY does us
an honour, when he mentions us, and, if drinking his Health is an Equivalent, I
aſſure you we are not behind-hand with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. I had a Letter from
Mr. D—N this Week; he ſeems as much alarmed as you at my moderate
Acknowledgment. Miſs F—Y is very glad to hear that you deſign her a

ſo fatigued, that they are not able to achieve a Line. Apprized of this, and
being by Nature diſpoſed to have Mercy on the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, 
<q>Parcere ſubjectis, &amp; debellare ſuperbos,</q> 
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1173200201:60"/> I ſeldom write a Syllable more than is requiſite to
further ſome Scheme, or aſcertain ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview; the latter being the
Purpoſe of this mine Epiſtle. I am in great Hopes I ſhall be at Liberty
to ſee you, ere many Weeks be paſt, and would beg of you to let me know by
a Line, when I am moſt likely, or when very unlikely, to meet with you at
Home. The Reaſon why I can fix no week, at preſent, is, that I am in daily
Expectations of Mr. LYTTELTON, and the HAGLEY Family. I dined there, ſome
Time ſince, with Mr. PITT, Mr. BOUHOURS, Mr. CAMPION, and all the World. Mr.
THOM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, that right friendly Bard, was expected, and I fancy may be there now.
Mr. LYT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TELTON offered me the Viſit, and I own I am pleaſed with the
Proſpect of ſhewing him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the <hi>Leaſowes</hi> beyond his
Expectations. I have made a great Improvement in VIRGIL's Grove, ſince you
were here, and have finiſhed a new Path from it to the Houſe, after the
Manner you approved. They are going to build a Rotund to terminate the Viſto
at <hi>Hagley</hi>; I think there is a little Hill joining the Park, that would
ſuit one better, tho' it will be very pretty where it is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:1173200201:61"/>If I come to your Houſe, I won't go to Mr.
M—R's. He has been, twice, as near me as the <hi>Grange,</hi> with
CHARLES LYTTELTON, but never deemed my Situation worth ſeeing. I doubt you
are a little too modeſt in praiſing it, wherever you go. Why don't you

is tumbled about the World! He was overturned in going to Town, and now again
in coming back. Is not this falling up Stairs and down

            <p>AS it has hitherto ſeemed good to you to expatiate pretty largely
on ſo diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive a Subject as a Thimble, I flatter myſelf that you may
read with Patience an Account of the Life and Converſation of your moſt
trifling humble Servant. Otherwiſe, I ſhould not have told you, that I am
extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in my preſent Situation; that, when you left the Country,
I had recourſe to another Kind of natural Beauties, namely, that which is to
be found in 
<q rend="inline">"Groves, Meads, and murmuring Streams,"</q> and ſo
long as Summer was pleaſed to continue his Favours, I looked upon your 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1173200201:64"/> Departure as what only changed my Pleaſure to
Amuſement. Now, indeed, Summer has forſaken me likewiſe; the Trees and
Groves are ſtripped of their Covering, and I am left without any Fence
againſt Spleen, Vapours, Megrim, Diſcontent, and a numerous Train of ſuch
Sort of Beings, which plague me to Death, whenever I offer to recollect your
Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and how often that happens, I leave any one to gueſs but
yourſelf, becauſe any one elſe is better acquainted with the numerous
Ways and Means you have of rendering your Company agreeable. I appeal alſo to
the ſame Perſons to gueſs how provoking you are, when you mention the
Poſſibility there was that I might have ſeen you at the
<hi>Leaſowes</hi> ſome Time ago. What need you tell one of it, ſince it
could not be effected? Why will you put me upon curſing Fortune upon more
Accounts than I have already Occaſion to do? Pray let me endeavour to conform
myſelf to my real Circumſtances, rather than give me a Glimpſe of the
Pleaſure which you was about to do me, and yet had not the Goodneſs to go
through with. I want no Inducements to come to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> ſince I
diſcovered that you lived there, <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1173200201:65"/> and that being all that
was neceſſary, tho' you have mentioned others that are attractive.</p>
            <p>I beg you would make my Compliments agreeable to Mrs. WINSMORE,
which you are beſt capable of doing, for two Reaſons; firſt, becauſe
you know the Sincerity of my Eſteem, and, ſecondly, becauſe I have no
Idea how any Thing you ſay can be diſagreeable. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that
ſhe remembers me, and that ſhe ſpoke of me in the ſame Breath with Mrs.
KNIGHT (as my Vanity interprets your Letter) makes me ſo vain, that I, with
the utmoſt Aſſurance, take the Liberty of ſubſcribing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</p>

            <p>I WAS much concerned to hear by Mr. WILLIAMS's Account, laſt
<hi>Thurſday,</hi> that your Ladyſhip has been greatly indiſpoſed. The
Particulars of your Diſorder he does not mention, but tells me, he was
deſired to give it as a Reaſon that I did not hear from you before. It is
as natural for me to make En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry concerning the Recovery of your Health, as
it is for me to wiſh it, which I very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly do; I have, therefore,
ſent an honeſt Neighbour of mine upon this Errand, who will be glad of an
Opportunity of ſeeing <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels.</hi> Poor TOM, my truſty Servant, has,
ever ſince I came from <hi>Barrels,</hi> been in a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way; and
whether he ever may regain the ſmall Share of Health he has been uſed to,
is a great Queſtion, elſe I had ſent ſomething <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1173200201:69"/>
ſooner. But I muſt requeſt your Ladyſhip not to write, if you find it
the leaſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. A verbal Meſſage will be very ſufficient,
till ſuch Time as you can write me a full Account of your Recovery.</p>
            <p>I have no Particulars that can tempt me to enlarge this Letter, and,
indeed, I hardly wiſh for any, leſt I ſhould accidentally let fall any
Thing, that might tempt you, at this Time, to write an Anſwer; which, tho'
ſo highly agreeable to me at a more favourable Seaſon, can afford me little
Satisfaction, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that you write in Pain.</p>
            <p>I hope Mr. HALL is recovered by this Time. As my rural Scenery could
not attract him hither in Summer, I have little Hopes that my Converſation
can have that Effect in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Few Perſons care to ride twelve dirty Miles

that is, <hi>thinking upon Nothing.</hi> A very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyous Circumſtance this,

            </opener>
            <p>AFTER having owned, that the Fear your Ladyſhip has been under, is
in reality to be imputed to me, I am at a Loſs for Words to expreſs my
Concern, or to alleviate my Fault. I will not, however, diſallow that the
Book came to Hand much ſooner than I could reaſonably expect it, and that
the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encloſed in it, gave me that uncommon Pleaſure, which your
Ladyſhip's never fail to do. I have nothing to ſay in my Behalf, but that I
have never had Health or Spirits ſince I received it, that might encourage me
to think I could return an Anſwer as I ought; and even to-night my Spirits
are ſo bad, and my Head ſo confuſed, that I have no Reaſon to hope
<hi>theſe few Lines</hi> can do any Thing more, than free you from your
preſent Uncertainty. But if I am honoured with a Line from your 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1173200201:72"/> Ladyſhip hereafter, I will immediately acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it
as well as I am able, let my Capacity be what it will.</p>
            <p>I do not know how far your Ladyſhip's Name may be
diſtinguiſhable by a <hi>Poſt-Woman</hi>'s Ear; but this I know, that if
I had been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon H—K, your Ladyſhip ſhould not have known from
me, that there was any Woman in the World, who could expreſs herſelf
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you with the Indecency you mention. I am aſtoniſhed at her
Behaviour, and not a little at her Forgetfulneſs. There ſeems to me to be
no ſurer Conveyance in the World than that of the Farmer, by whom I ſent my
Letter to the Poſt-Office at <hi>Henley,</hi> and by whom, I ſuppoſe, you
conveyed your Parcel. However, in Obedience to your Ladyſhip's Commands, I
have ſent this Letter to Maſter H—K, and ſhall have an additional
Preſſure on my Spirits, till I hear you have been pleaſed to forgive my
Neglect. I know extremely well, that Want of Time and Leiſure, and ſome
other Excuſes, which are often made for not writing, can be of Weight from
<hi>no one</hi> but a Cobler, who has ten or a dozen Children dependent on a
<hi>Tatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-End</hi>; <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1173200201:73"/> but I know as well, that your
Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's is no ordinary Correſpondence, and that a Perſon ought to
have a clear Head, and an unembarraſſed Chearfulneſs of Temper, when he
ſits down to anſwer any Letter of yours. For my Part, I hardly look upon
this as any Letter <hi>at all,</hi> and will infallibly write again, as ſoon
as I can recover my natural State of Mind. I have <hi>as</hi> little Reaſon
to conſider the encloſed <hi>as Poetry</hi>; but as they were
<hi>ſhort</hi> Compoſitions, I had been writing them out yeſterday, with
a Deſign to ſend them to the Poſt-Office to-night.</p>
            <p>I am afraid I have tired your Ladyſhip with Madrigal and Sonnet. I
hope, when the Weather gets finer (with which my Spirits uniformly
ſympathize) to vary my Stile a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for your Ladyſhip's Amuſement; in
the mean Time, I have ſent you a Poem, written by a Gentleman of my
Acquaintance, and ſhewn up, for a College-Exerciſe, in Print. Your
Ladyſhip will ſoon diſcover a juvenile Want of Judgment in ſeveral
Places; but I truſt that the Elegance of his Fancy you will admire. He
ſometimes comes and and ſtays <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1173200201:74"/> a Month with me at the
<hi>Leaſowes,</hi> in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the next Time he does ſo, I will be
obliged to your Ladyſhip for Leave to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him at <hi>Barrels.</hi> I
am miſtaken, if he will not be pleaſed almoſt to a Degree of
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>As to your Ladyſhip's Lameneſs, tho' it comes laſt in this
irregular Letter, I beg Leave to aſſure you, that it gave me a ſincere
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to hear that it was bad, and a very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Pleaſure to hear
it was abated. I as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh your Ladyſhip's Health and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as you do yourſelf; and as I ſolemnly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that ſuch is
always the Diſpoſition of my Mind, I <hi>will</hi> hope to be forgiven, if
I ſhould, through Ignorance, fall ſhort in my Means of expreſſing it.
This laſt Neglect is what I ſhall ſcarce again be guilty of, and can only
be excuſed by your Ladyſhip's Candour.</p>

might bid the faireſt to do ſo, yet was I not without Conviction, that your
Ladyſhip would feel ſome ſort of Complacency upon the Sight of a Scrip of
Paper, which ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you that I was alive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1173200201:81"/>Alive, indeed, I am; at leaſt, if it may be
called ſo, to exiſt among a Set of People, whoſe Employments,
Paſſions, and Sentiments, are entirely foreign to my own; and where I
ſee, and hear, and do nothing, but what I think may as well be left unſeen,
unheard, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. What can your Ladyſhip expect from a Correſpondent
ſo ſituated, beſide pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Friendſhip, and many artleſs
Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of their Reality and Continuance?</p>
            <p>Mr. O— ſtayed pretty near a Week with me. He has, I think,
ſtrict Honour, Good-nature, and good Senſe. What he wants, in my Eye, is a
little genuine <hi>Taſte</hi>; for tho' good Senſe may, by Degrees, enable
a Perſon to diſcover the Beauties of Nature or Art, yet it can never
furniſh him with any extraordinary Reliſh or Enjoyment of them, which is
the Effect of innate Taſte alone, and which differs as widely from the
former, as the Palate differs from the Brain. Your Ladyſhip has, I dare
ſay, frequently made the ſame obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1173200201:82"/>You will hear Sir THOMAS LYTTELTON,
notwithſtanding he complained always of his <hi>Head,</hi> died of a
<hi>Polypus</hi> in the <hi>great Artery</hi>; which, I do not find, was ever,
in the leaſt, ſuſpected by his Phyſicians; but which, if it had been
ever ſo apparent, they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have cured. You will imagine
that his Death muſt have thrown a Sort of Gloom round the Villages in his
Neighbourhood. A nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and faſhionable Family animates a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Place
to an inconceivable Degree. The Family at <hi>Hagley</hi> will be immediately
diſperſed. Miſs LYTTELTON goes to Lady LITCHFIELD's, to the
<hi>Colonel</hi>'s, to <hi>London,</hi> and does not think to ſettle. Miſs
WEST goes firſt to <hi>Stow,</hi> and then intends to reſide with her
Brother the <hi>Commodore.</hi> Sir GEORGE and his Lady ſet out for
<hi>London</hi> to-morrow, and as they propoſe to build, next Spring, upon
the <hi>old Foundation,</hi> it may be many Years ere they come to reſide
amongſt us, even for a ſmall Part of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>Lord DUDLEY and I dined together at <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> laſt
<hi>Wedneſday,</hi> where we found Lord AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON's <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1173200201:83"/>
Brother, and ſome other Company. Mr. MILLER unluckily aſked me at Table,
how I liked the new Situation of their Column; which threw me under a
Neceſſity of offending either againſt the Rules of Politeneſs, or (what
it more ſacred with me) the Laws of Sincerity. The Truth is, I do not like it
upon many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; and I am perſuaded, before many Years are paſt, they
will be of the ſame Mind. But leaſt of all, do I approve their Intentions
of building three new Fronts, and altering every Room by a gothic Model, and
that with an Eye to Frugality, at the ſame Time that they have not an Inch of
Gothiciſm about the Houſe, to warp their Imagination that Way. But this
Subject never fails to lead me too far; nor can I explain myſelf to the full,
unleſs I could ſhew your Ladyſhip their Plan. The fine Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation they
have, within an hundred Yards, they neglect;—in ſhort, as it appears to
me, they are going to ſacrifice an Opportunity of rendering their Place
compleat, for the Sake of an imperfect, but expenſive Specimen of gothic
Architecture; which, not having its Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either in Truth or Proportion,
will fall into <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1173200201:84"/> Diſgrace again in the Courſe of a few

            <p>Mr. S— has ſo mangled and disfigured my <hi>Grove,</hi> that

               <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HOW long ſoever your Letters are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they never fail to
aſſure their Welcome, by being more agreeable and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining, as well as
breathing more of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, than any Body's <hi>elſe</hi> have the Art
of doing. I have been here about a Month, and find ſome little Improvements,
which were ordered when we went to <hi>London,</hi> compleated; 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1173200201:86"/> and I think they are not quite unworthy of the Name. A
Piece of waſte Ground, on the lower Side of the Abbey-Walk, has been turned
into a Corn-Field, and a Turf-Walk, about eight Feet wide, round it; cloſe to
a flouriſhing Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn Hedge; on one Side, there is a thatched Seat open on
three Sides, which pretends to no Name of greater Dignity, than juſtly
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to what it repreſents, namely a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's Hut; before it there is
an irregular Piece of Turf, which was ſpared for the Sake of ſome old Oaks
and Beeches, which are ſcattered upon it; and as you are ſitting down
there, you have, under theſe Boughs, a direct View of <hi>Windſor</hi>
Caſtle. There are Sweet-Williams, Narciſſus's, Roſe-Campions, and
ſuch Flowers as the Hares will not eat, in little Borders, round the Foot of
every Tree; and I almoſt flatter myſelf, that you would not be
diſpleaſed with the rural Appearance of the whole. The Rains have given us
the ſtrongeſt Verdure I ever ſaw: our Lawns and Meadows are enamelled
with a Profuſion of Daſies and Cowſlips, and we have the greateſt
Appearance of Fruit that has been ſeen theſe many Years. I conclude you
will read Mr. <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1173200201:87"/> THOMSON's <hi>Caſtle of Indolence</hi>:
'tis after the Manner of SPENCER, but I think he does not always keep ſo
cloſe to his Stile, as the <hi>Author of the School-Miſtreſs,</hi>
whoſe Name I never knew, till you were ſo good as to inform me of it. I
think it a charming Poem; and was very much pleaſed with his Ballad of
<hi>Queen</hi> ELIZABETH's ſeeing the Milk-Maid. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears, at leaſt
in my humble Imagination, in a more natural Light, than when we hear of her
bullying foreign Powers, and cutting off the Head of an unhappy Queen, who fled
to her for Protection. But to return to <hi>the Caſtle of Indolence</hi>; I
believe it will afford you much Entertainment; there are many pretty Paintings
in it, but I think the <hi>Wizard's Song</hi> deſerves a Preference.— 
<q rend="inline">"He needs no Muſe who dictates from his
Heart."</q> Have you met with two little Volumes, which contain four
Contemplations, written by a Mr. JAMES HERVEY, a young <hi>Corniſh</hi> or
<hi>Devonſhire</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman? The Subjects are upon walking among the
Tombs, upon a Flower Garden, upon Night, and upon the ſtarry Heavens. There
is ſomething poetical and truly pious. Now I have got into the Impertinence
of recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1173200201:88"/> Books to one who is a much better Judge

               <note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                  <p>The <hi>Eſſay on Delicacy,</hi> here mentioned, was the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Dr. NATHANIEL LANCASTER, many Years Rector of <hi>Stanford
Rivers,</hi> near <hi>Ongar,</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Uncle to the Editor of
theſe Letters. He was a Man of ſtrong natural Parts, great Erudition,
refined Taſte, and maſter of a nervous, and at the ſame Time, elegant
Stile, as is very obvious to every one who has had the Happineſs to read the
Eſſay here ſpoken of. His Writings were fewer in Number than their
Author's Genius ſeemed to promiſe to his Friends, and his Publications
leſs known than their intrinſic Excellence deſerved. Had he been as
ſolicitous, as he was capable, to inſtruct and pleaſe the World, few
Proſe-Writers would have ſurpaſſed him; but in his later Years, he
lived a Recluſe, and whatever he compoſed in the Hours of retired
Leiſure, he (unhappily for the Public) ordered to be burned, which was
religiouſly (I had almoſt ſaid irreligiouſly) performed.</p> 
                  <p>He was a Native of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and, in his earlier
Years, under the Patronage and Friendſhip of the late Earl of CHOLMONDELEY,
mixed in all the more exalted Scenes of poliſhed Life, where his lively
Spirit, and brilliant Converſation, rendered him univerſally
diſtinguiſhed and eſteemed; and even, till within a few Months of his
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, (near ſeventy-five Years of Age) theſe Faculties could ſcarce
be ſaid to be impaired.</p> 
                  <p>The <hi>Eſſay on Delicacy,</hi> (of which we are now
ſpeaking) the only material Work of his, which the Editor knows to have
ſurvived him, was firſt printed in the Year 1748, and has been very
judiciouſly and meritoriouſly preſerved by the late Mr. DODSLEY, in his
Fugitive Pieces, publiſhed in two Volumes.</p>
               </note> a Subject which, if I
were not acquainted with <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1173200201:89"/> you, and one or two more, I
ſhould imagine had no longer an Exiſtence upon our Globe.</p>
            <p>I ſincerely ſympathize in the Pleaſure which you muſt feel,
Dear Madam, from the extreme good Character which every Body gives of your Son,
and which his Behaviour to you proves he deſerves. May this, with every other

               <salute>Dear Mr. GRAVES,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I FIND a very ſtrong Impulſe, prompting me to write to you this
Evening. I don't know whether I ever let you into the Secret, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an inward Satisfaction at the Time that I am ſending you a Letter, and that
this Action partakes of the Nature of all virtuous ones, in being its own
Reward. However we are taught to hope for <hi>other</hi> and more
<hi>ample</hi> Rewards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Virtue, as I am inclined to expect a more
conſiderable Pleaſure, when I receive your Anſwer. My Soul now leans
entirely on the Friendſhip of a few private Acquaintance, and if they drop
me, I ſhall be a wretched Miſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrope. Is it a great Fatigue to you to
ſit down ſome vacant Half-Hour, and ſcribble me a few Lines, relating to
the State of your Mind, <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1173200201:91"/> and your Affairs?—DICK JAGO,
who called accidentally at a Public-houſe, at <hi>Mickleton,</hi> told me,
they heard —; mentioning, at the ſame Time, his thorough Conviction,
that, <hi>whatever</hi> might prove the Event of this Affair, as <hi>you</hi>
were a Principal, it would be as it <hi>ought.</hi> Mr. SMITH, (the Deſigner)
who knew you too, was here at the ſame Time, and many civil Things, very
agreeable to me, were ſaid in your Behalf; 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Immo, Omnes omnia bona dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere.</hi>"</q> As to
—</p>
            <p>I thank you for your little Strictures on the
<hi>School-Miſtreſs.</hi> I have ſacrificed my Partiality to your
unbiaſſed Judgment; <hi>Multa gemens,</hi> have I ſacrificed it. The
Truth is, I am not quite convinced (tho' I have acted as if I were) that one
ſhould give up any Part, that appears droll in itſelf, and makes the Poem,
on the whole, more agreeable, for the Sake of rendering it a more perfect
Imitation of SPENCER. But when you have more Leiſure, and I collect my 
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1173200201:92"/> Pieces, I don't deſpair of furniſhing a more compleat
Edition yet.</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH (whom I mentioned juſt now) has taken two Views of
<hi>Hagley-Park,</hi> which, with two from other Places, compleat a Set; the
Subſcription-Price, half a Guinea; but he takes other little Views of the
cloſer Scenes, and of particular Beauties, which will form a Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Book,
and which I ſhall like beyond thoſe I have ſubſcribed for. Would you
not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſee a Draught of my VIRGIL's <hi>Grove</hi> inſerted
among the latter?—He took one, and promiſed to have it engraved, and
inſerted ſomewhere; but I had rather he ſhould ſtay a Week, and take
about four Views, and that you were here, and would give him ſome
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and it ſhould make a little Drawing-Book to ſell for a
Shilling. But, 
<q rend="inline">"Ah, me!—I fondly dream"</q>—The Days of
Fancy and dear Enthuſiaſm will never more return! Such as thoſe that flew
over our Heads when you were <hi>here,</hi> and at <hi>Harborough,</hi> on your
firſt Viſit; when the <hi>merum Rus</hi> of the <hi>Leaſowes</hi> could
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you with pleaſanter Ideas, than the nobleſt Scenes that ever

            <p>WHEN I received your Ladyſhip's Letter on <hi>Friday,</hi> I was

at that Time, or the Viſit ſhould be otherwiſe unſeaſonable, your
Ladyſhip will be ſo good as to let us know; if not, I will not fail to
ſhew Miſs DOLMAN the Way to the moſt agreeable Entertainment, and the
moſt enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Converſation, I have met with any where. Your Ladyſhip

               <hi>Entertainment</hi> in the vulgar Senſe; (tho' what I ſay is true enough
in <hi>that)</hi> my chief Pleaſures, I flatter myſelf, are Pleaſures of
the <hi>Mind</hi>; and I can ſay, with great Truth, that my Mind was never
more <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to be pleaſed any where <hi>elſe,</hi> or found
equal Opportunities to gratify that Diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Miſs DOLMAN, tho' ſhe has not ſeen much of the World, has done

Mention you make of her. All I know is, that ſhe has <hi>Taſte</hi> enough
to put the Pleaſure I have promiſed her at <hi>Barrels</hi> out of all
Diſpute.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to other Things. I have ſent your Ladyſhip the

<hi>ſend</hi> it as indeed I <hi>offered</hi> it, becauſe it bears ſome
Relation to Lady HERTFORD, on Account of the Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Lord BEAUCHAMP,
which I believe is juſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:1173200201:96"/>I have of late read the Life of Colonel
GAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINER, being induced to do ſo by a Viſion, which is deſcribed there,
and which I hear Mr. LYTTELTON countenances. I will give your Ladyſhip my
Opinion of the Story, when I come to <hi>Barrels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray don't buy the Books <hi>I</hi> talked of; you will hardly read
them twice; and I can lend you HERVEY's <hi>Meditations,</hi> the <hi>Life of
Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> GARDINER, and, in a ſhort Time, <hi>Memoirs of Mrs.</hi>
PILKINGTON, either of my own, or my Brother's. I beſeech your Ladyſhip,
that I may have leave to ſave you ſix Shillings, and three Shillings, and
three Shillings; that is, according to the old Maxim, <hi>(viz.</hi> a

but proceed to one <hi>ouvert Act</hi> in the Cauſe of Oeconomy.—I

               <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Remember Mrs. HIGGONS uſed to ſay, Lady CLARENDON had ſuch a
Power over her Underſtanding, that ſhe might perſuade her ſhe was a
Fiſh. You have pretty near the ſame Aſcendant over mine, yet cannot quite
convince me, that eight Months is not an immoderate while to keep Silence, and
make a Chaſm in a Correſpondence with a Friend, who inceſſantly
wiſhes to hear of your Health and Happineſs. I am not more eaſily
ſeduced into an aſſent to your Apology; for though I admire the beautiful
Language in which the Fiction of your Dullneſs is painted, I cannot miſtake
it for a Truth. I am ſo bad at Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I will not ſearch for an
ingenious Fable, to excuſe myſelf for troubling you with an Anſwer ſo
ſoon, though my Readineſs to obey <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1173200201:100"/> your Commands, in
ſubſcribing for the Prints you mention (if you will let me know where I
muſt ſend for a Receipt) might furniſh me with one: but honeſtly own,
that as my Lord has been in <hi>London</hi> ſince <hi>Thurſday,</hi> I did
not know how to employ the leiſure Hours his Abſence afforded me, more to
my Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>We returned hither from <hi>Bath</hi> only <hi>Friday</hi> the
Eleventh: we were there two Months, the laſt Fortnight of which we were
detained, after all our Things were gone, by my poor Lord's having a Fit of the
Gout; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we came away rather too ſoon after it, for his Limbs had
not recovered their Strength, ſo that he was terribly fatigued; however, he
has now recovered it, and is certainly upon the whole infinitely the better,
for having drank the <hi>Bath</hi> Waters. If I could envy you, dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I
ſhould be tempted to do it, for being in Reach of <hi>Hagley,</hi> for having
Mr. WEST for a Neighbour, and Mr. SHENSTONE for a Friend. He has obliged me
ſo much, in letting me ſee his charming Ode upon Autumn, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he
does Mr. THOMSON's Memory in that Poem, and in his Deſign to erect an Urn 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1173200201:101"/> for him in VIRGIL's <hi>Grove,</hi> that I am ſorry I
cannot agree with him, in his Diſlike to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.</hi> On the contrary, I
draw one Motive of my Partiality to it, from a ſimilar Cauſe to what he
partly aſcribes his Averſion: he hates it as a Seaſon which deprived him
of a Friend; I love it, becauſe the lateſt Days my Heart could boaſt of
Happineſs, in the beſt and moſt beloved of Sons, were in that Time of the
Year, till (as Dr. YOUNG ſays) 
<q> 
                  <l>—At <hi>Death</hi>'s Toll, whoſe reſtleſs, iron
Tongue</l> 
                  <l>Calls daily for his Millions at a Meal,</l> 
                  <l>Starting I woke, and found myſelf undone.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And then, 
<q> 
                  <l>The Clouds, the Winds, the Rains, the falling Leaves,</l> 
                  <l>The naked Branches, the poor ſhivering Birds—</l>
               </q>
Every Thing around me ſeemed to ſympathize in my Diſtreſs, and ſtill
at every melancholy Anniverſary of my ever-to-be-lamented Loſs, put on the
ſame friendly Appearance of ſocial Sorrow; and I may ſay with MYRA, in
her <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1173200201:102"/> Poem, before Mr. THOMSON's firſt Edition of the
Seaſons, 
<q> 
                  <l>To thee, my gently-drooping Head I bend,</l> 
                  <l>Thy Sigh my Siſter, and thy Tear my Friend.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Forgive me, dear Madam, for thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally returning to this
afflicting Subject: but two Lines of Mr. POPE's, with the Alteration only of
one Word, muſt plead my excuſe, 
<q> 
                  <l>Of all Affliction taught a <hi>Sufferer</hi> yet,</l> 
                  <l>'Tis ſure the hardeſt Science to forget.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have done—and will now tell you, that our being obliged to
go to <hi>Bath,</hi> has hindered us from undertaking any Thing here, ſo that
I have nothing to talk of that is new, and I am afraid there was Nothing here
before, that would make a tolerable Figure, either in a Print or a Drawing; a
Flat can hardly look well upon Paper, though in reality, the Variety of Woods
and Lawns, Water, Graſs, and Gravel, may produce a Contraſt not
unpleaſing to the Eye. I am ſorry you find any Defects in Mr. HERVEY; for
both the Deſign and Manner of his Writing pleaſes me extremely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1173200201:103"/>I want to know what you think of the

been very well entertained lately with the two firſt Volumes of the

            </opener>
            <p>IN the firſt Place, I return you Thanks for your very polite
Letter, which, I do aſſure you, I was proud of receiving, and ſhould have
troubled you with an Anſwer the ſame Day, could I write with as little
Difficulty as you.</p>
            <p>I admire the Counteſs's Letter, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that Part about
her Son. She ſeems ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of her great Loſs ſtill. She talks of
VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIL's <hi>Grove,</hi> as if ſhe had ſeen it. I am ſure, if ſhe had,
ſhe would have been highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the Beauties of that Place. I want
Summer to come, that I may ſee the Urn, which you intend to erect to
THOMSON's Memory, and VIRGIL's <hi>Grove</hi> in Perfection.</p>
            <p>With Careleſſneſs and Inattention, I have read Mrs.
PILKINGTON's ſecond Volume; ſhe <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1173200201:105"/> is ſtill more
entertaining; I think ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes herſelf well; I fancy too her
Poetry to be good; and I dare ſay, ſhe will think it hard not to be allowed
the Liberty of her Tongue and Pen.—But I ought to be aſhamed of giving
my Opinion, with ſo much Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to one who is ſo good a Judge of
Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as you are.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Litchfield</hi> Journey afforded me but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Amuſement; leſs even than I expected. Mrs. DOLMAN had two Viſitants, Mrs.
WHIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BY and her Daughter, who came from the ſame Town where Lord ANSON lives.
They talked much in Praiſe of his Lordſhip, and ſeemed to be intimate
Acquaintance of his.</p>
            <p>Miſs FLETCHER's ſevere Letter has never been anſwered yet: I
hope, Sir, that will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for the Shortneſs of this, becauſe I muſt

            <p>SO, you are determined, Sir, to be ſilent, till I have wrote
again!—An effectual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, indeed, to make me; for I ſhould be very
imprudent, did I not procure myſelf your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable Letters every
Opportunity I had, which are ſure to pleaſe, amuſe, and inſtruct at the
ſame Time. But I have really ſo great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for my own, that, when I
have finiſhed a Letter, I can ſcarcely perſuade myſelf to ſend it,
were I not inclined to believe, you are more my Friend, than to make any Uſe
of it to my Diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>Laſt Week I received an Epiſtle from Miſs FANNY FLETCHER. All

               <q rend="inline">"Mrs. D—T, of <hi>Worfield,</hi> is dead. Her
Son is gone to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to qualify himſelf for a Living of

            </opener>
            <p>THO' I may ſeem to have been extremely idle, I have really taken
no ſmall Pains in endeavouring to obey your Ladyſhip's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. I wiſh,
when you peruſe my Pacquet, you may not rather think me too officious; tho' I
ſhould imagine even that a Crime by no Means equal to Negligence, in any
Affair, wherein you are pleaſed to employ me. How far I have erred in that
Reſpect, I am utterly unable to judge, as your Ladyſhip's Directions were
not very <hi>explicit,</hi> and as I have not been favoured with a ſingle
Syllable from Mr. H—LL, to inform me <hi>whether,</hi> or <hi>how
far</hi> he approved of <hi>any</hi> Alterations. But what Harm do I commit? I
do not call them <hi>Alterations,</hi> which I ſend; they are only a ſmall
Cargo of different Expreſſions, which I ſincerely deſire you will apply
or <hi>reject,</hi> entirely as you think <pb n="92" facs="tcp:1173200201:110"/> proper; nor
ſhall it give me the leaſt Offence if you reject the whole, if ſo be you
pleaſe to acquit me of Preſumption. To ſpeak my <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>
Thoughts, I think the Epitaph on Mr. H—LL's Father, and, indeed, all
Epitaphs, ſhould be ſhort. What I have chiefly aimed at in Number I. and
Number II. is to expreſs his <hi>general</hi> Character in few Words.
Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, if Mr. H—LL chuſes to have a more <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
Account of his Father, I ſhould think he had better let 
<note n="*" place="bottom">A Printer then reſiding at
<hi>Birmingham.</hi>
               </note>ARIS take off about half a Score Copies (on a
ſingle Sheet) of that which your Ladyſhip has ſketched out; after you
have made what Improvements and Additions you ſhall think adviſable; I mean
to give them away amongſt a few Friends or Relations. I am not languid, in my
Wiſhes to advance the Character to as high a Pitch, as Mr. H—LL can
deſire, for I believe his Father might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve as good an one, as any
Perſon in a public Station. But you remember theſe Lines of Mr.
POPE—according to the Way of the World, 
<q> 
                  <l>'Tis from high Life, high Characters are drawn;</l> 
                  <l>A Saint in Crape is twice a Saint in Lawn,</l>

                  <l>More wiſe, more learn'd, more juſt, more ev'ry
Thing.</l>
               </q> Where, by the Way, the ſecond and third Verſes ſeem to
dwell upon the ſame Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—but the whole Paragraph, to the
beſt of my Memory, is exceedingly beautiful. What there ſeems of
<hi>Weight</hi> in this, ſo far as regards the preſent Purpoſe, is, that
the Character of a Perſon in private Life ſhould not be drawn too
pompouſly. Perhaps, I am <hi>too</hi> ſcrupulous; however, I wiſh your
Ladyſhip may be full as much ſo, in Regard to my trifling Criticiſms.
Does the Affair require Haſte, or may it be deferred till I have the Honour
of ſeeing you?—I will, however, for the preſent, take Leave of the
Subject.</p>
            <p>I lead the unhappy Life of ſeeing nothing in the Creation ſo
idle as myſelf. I am continually piddling in little Matters about my Farm.
What do you think of my publiſhing Verſes once a Week upon my Skreens, for

            <p>YOUR Ladyſhip bids me give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what Alterations we
are making at preſent, but I feel myſelf much leſs able to deſcribe the
Fabrick and Furniture of a Palace than a Hermitage, and while I am attending to

it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, than a Perſon would be with the Beauty of a Piece of
Tapeſtry, who ſaw only the wrong Side of it. My Lord will do a good Deal to
the Front of the Houſe, in order to make it appear leſs like a Priſon; he
builds a new Wing on the Right-hand Side of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which will contain a
Library, Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Dreſſing-Room, and a Waiting-Room. I think I told
you, that all the Saſhes, Doors, and Ceilings, in both Apartments, muſt be
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1173200201:115"/> new, and the Floors in my Lord's; the
Stair-caſe is very noble, but will require as large a Lanthorn to light it,
as that at <hi>Hough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> ſo much celebrated in the News-papers. The
Chimney-Pieces in both Apartments are to be all new, and ſome of them very
expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; the Draughts are mighty pretty. My Lord's Bed on the Ground-Floor
is crimſon Damaſk, with Tapeſtry Hangings; the next Room is furniſhed
with green Damaſk, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſet off his Pictures; the next with a
Set of very fine old Hangings of the Duke of NEWCASTLE's Horſemanſhip, with
his own Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, on Horſeback, as big as Life; and, now they are clean,
looking neat, as when new. The Parlour to be hung with ſome very good
Pictures; above Stairs, the great waiting Room, with <hi>Saxon</hi> green Cloth
Chairs, with gilt Nails, and green Luteſtring Window Curtains, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Table,
and large Glaſs between the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; firſt Drawing-Room, new crimſon
Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſk, with Luteſtring Window Curtains, two very fine <hi>Japan</hi>
Tables and Glaſſes between the Windows, with carv'd and gilt Frames; inner
Drawing-Room, Tapeſtry Hangings, with ſmall Figures very pretty, and as
freſh as new. <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1173200201:116"/> He lays two Rooms together in the right
Wing of the Court, on the ground Floor, in order to make a Chapel, with a
Gothic Wainſcot, Cei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and painted Windows; there is to be a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Stove in it, which is ſo contrived, as to repreſent a Tomb
with an Urn upon it. The Court is to be paved, and the Foot-Way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; and
my Lord is in Treaty for nine Houſes on the other Side the Way, in order to
pull them down and build Stables, (for there are none belonging to the Houſe)
whoſe Gates are intended to open directly over againſt thoſe of the
Court; if he can agree for this Purchaſe, he will widen the Street in that
Part about eight Feet. Now, dear Madam, I have obeyed, you in the beſt Manner
I am able: but upon looking back into my Letter, I find I have forgot my
Bed-Chamber, Dreſſing-Room and Cloſet, which one would think, ſhould
not appear leaſt intereſting to myſelf; the firſt of theſe is to have
a new Bed-Hanging, and Chairs of crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Queen's Damaſk; the
Dreſſing-Room, which has two large Saſhes, will have Tapeſtry Hangings
and green Damaſk Chairs; the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, which is ſmall, and has only one
Saſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly facing the Chimney, furniſhed with paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1173200201:117"/> Paper; the Chimney-Piece in the Dreſſing-Room, is to
be of Statuary-Marble and <hi>Giallo di Siering,</hi> and juſt in the Front
of it, the Fable of the Stork inviting the Fox to Dinner, very neatly carved;
there is another little Waiting-Room, at this End of the Apartment, for the
Groom of the Chambers to be in, in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or, when I'm not in Form, in
the Evening. To return to my <hi>Bergerie,</hi> nothing has been done in it
this Summer, nor have I the Heart to propoſe any Thing, for I'm actually
frightened with the Sum my Lord is laying out, about
<hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland-Houſe</hi>; and I find, by living long in ſtrait
Circumſtances, one contracts a Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, which makes launching
out at once into great Expence, not appear ſo deſirable, as it would be
thought by young, gay People. The cold North Winds have blighted and ruined the
Beauty of my Roſes for the Remainder of this Year, and ſtarved all the
various Flowers, which uſed to adorn our Clumps and Borders. The Time of our
going into <hi>Suſſex</hi> remains unfixed; but I fancy it will be in about
a Month: and we have taken a new Houſe in <hi>Bath,</hi> for the firſt Week
in <hi>September,</hi> ſo that inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying my peaceful Shades, as
I uſed to do, <pb n="100" facs="tcp:1173200201:118"/> I appear engaged in a tedious
Pilgrimage, and am looking (over the Charms of the Summer Month) to a reſting
Place in <hi>Northumberland-Houſe,</hi> and where, perhaps, I may never come;
the probability is much ſtronger againſt me, than it was, this Time five
Years, againſt my ever-lamented BEAUCHAMP; and indeed I am far from well at
preſent, having a moſt terrible Cough and Cold, with a continual Head-ach
and Sickneſs at my Stomach.</p>
            <p>I am glad to hear, that Mrs. W—L's ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Neglect did not
proceed from her own Heart, but the Hardneſs of another's, which is a
Stranger to all that is gentle or humane. I am perſuaded, your Improvements
will add great Beauty to your Habitation, and would make me long to ſee it,
if I were a movable Being, but you know I never was fond of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, and I
cannot take a Journey now, but as the <hi>Rhodian Coloſſus</hi> might do.
Among all my Lord's Acquiſitions, none has given me more Pleaſure than his
Chaplain, who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſixty and ſeventy, very well bred, ſtrictly
pious, and they ſay, is an admirable Scholar; has a Genius for all the polite
Arts, is a good <pb n="101" facs="tcp:1173200201:119"/> Judge of Poetry, has read a prodigious
deal, is very <hi>modeſt,</hi> and at the ſame Time conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chearful,
but naturally inclined to a ſolitary Country Life; in ſhort, we are all
fond of his Company, from my Lord to the loweſt Servant in the Houſe. I am

               <salute>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE buried a Friend, who has made me his Executor, and, of
conſequence, I have had a good deal of Fatigue. I tell you this thus
abruptly, becauſe I could not have wrote a Sentence without bluſhing, till
I had, in my Opinion, made a reaſonable Excuſe for my ſeeming Neglect of
you; you, who ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly obliged me by your laſt Favour. The Flowers
were the fineſt I have ſeen this Seaſon, though I have ſeen thoſe of
a celebrated Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt this Year—inferior in no Reſpect, and
ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in this, (which weighs much with me) that they will not fade. Such
is the Advantage of Art, the Offspring of the Mind, above the periſhable
Beauties of Nature. I am ſure they ſhall never periſh in my Hands, for I
ſhall even piouſly tranſmit them down to Poſterity, 
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1173200201:121"/> as they deſerve. You are continually finding out
ſome new Way to raviſh your Friends, and yet that ſeems needleſs,
ſince in your old one, I mean that of Wit, you ſeem to be infinite. All
this is ſo, and ſo ſuperlatively ſo, that I begin to think myſelf a
Fool to hold ſo unequal a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence. I am a Gainer in one Reſpect,
but I am certainly a Loſer in another. It is a great Proof of my Affection to
you however, for none but mean Souls would, otherwiſe, prefer their
Pleaſure to their Honour. To ſpeak in the moſt ſincere Manner, I never
am ſo ſenſible of my own Inability, as when I take one of your Letters
before me to anſwer it. Emulation immediately ceaſes, and then you cannot
wonder if I fall even below the Bathos of my own Genius.</p>
            <p>I know you are, by this Time, impatient to hear what Friend I have
loſt. It is Mr. BROOKER, of whom you have often heard me ſpeak. I have
<hi>got,</hi> indeed, by his Death, but I aſſure you, no Gain would be
ſufficient to make me unconcerned at the Loſs of a Friend—ſo far
from it, that the Acquiſition only adds <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1173200201:122"/> to the
Tenderneſs, and conſequently to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.</p>
            <p>Now I muſt return to the old Burthen. When ſhall I ſee
you?—I long to ſee you—'Tis more than GARRICK playing RICHARD to
ſee you—the next higheſt Pitch my Imagination can ſoar. I long too
to ſee your Alterations, which I look upon as ſo many of your viſible
Ideas.</p>
            <p>As for my Retreat, it is not worth deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing; or, to deſcribe
it at once, I may call it a Band-Box, <hi>viz.</hi> "The Citizen's Delight."
However, I wiſh you were in it: and now let me propoſe my Scheme. It is the
ſame I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed laſt Year. It is to meet either here, or at
<hi>London,</hi> firſt; for I ſhall be alternately at both Places, and will
order my Route at your Pleaſure. I purpoſe going ſoon; but a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from
you ſhall determine my Schemes at any Time. Though if I ſhould be at
<hi>London,</hi> and you would come thither firſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with me to
<hi>Whitchurch,</hi> it would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat my Wiſhes, for I long to be at both
Places with you. My Reſidence in <hi>London</hi> is at Mr. PEARETH's
Chambers, <hi>King's-Bench-Walks,</hi> 
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:1173200201:123"/> No. 7; but direct
to me at <hi>Whitchurch</hi> as yet.</p>
            <p>If you have any Vanity, it muſt be exquiſitely fed by the
ſmalleſt Favour from Lady LUXBO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROUGH. If you have a Taſte for
Pleaſure, refined to the higheſt Degree, (Why did I ſay, <hi>If?)</hi> by
all Accounts, her Politeneſs muſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it to the full. When I ſay
this, I don't ſpeak in the Groſs; I don't ſay, that this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or the
other ſaid ſhe was a Wonder, (tho' that I can aver too) but I go upon
better Grounds for my Aſſertion, than general Applauſe; I go upon
Particulars, from which I have formed a Character that muſt be beautiful.</p>
            <p>You complain of Mr. —. I told him of it, but don't know
whether he has made an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement. I am a good deal picqued at him myſelf.
Tho' we live next Door to each other, he has ſpent but one Evening with me
ſince he has been at —, and that was after a thouſand
Remonſtrances, and much againſt his Will. He neglects every Body for his
Wife; in ſhort, <hi>he is no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:1173200201:124"/>I hope you will favour me with a Line ſoon,
and that it may bring

you. With theſe I muſt conclude, applauding myſelf, whenever I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect

            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I look upon the Date of your Letter, it puts me both out of
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Patience with myſelf. Your Letter found me at <hi>Bath,</hi>
from whence, I thank God, my Lord is returned with his Health and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1173200201:125"/> much improved; and I hope, the good Effects of this
Journey, will continue longer than thoſe of the preceding Years. Our
Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Goods have all been removed to <hi>Northumberland-Houſe,</hi>
ſince before Michaelmas, but when we ſhall get into it ourſelves, is yet
among the Secrets of Fate. It is ſtill hid with Scaffolds towards the Street,
but by the Plan, and the little I could ſee of it when I was in
<hi>London,</hi> on the King's Birth-Day, it will be very handſome, and
indeed it ſhould, my Lord deſtined 10,000<hi>l.</hi> for the Alterations;
but I believe he has by this Time experienced, that he deceived himſelf, at
not ſetting it at above double; for though the Houſe itſelf will not
coſt, perhaps, above 14.000<hi>l.</hi> yet the Houſes he has purchaſed,
in order to widen the Street and build his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the Remainder of the
Duke of CHAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOS's grant for <hi>Scotland-Yard,</hi> which he is in Treaty for,
in order to carry down his Garden, and open a View from his Houſe to the
<hi>Thames,</hi> will coſt at leaſt as much more. Mean Time, you may
gueſs our poor <hi>Bergerie</hi> has been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and except a very
pretty and convenient Hot-Houſe for Pine-Apples, has had no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Ornament of any Kind. We paſs this <pb n="108" facs="tcp:1173200201:126"/> Winter here, which
I ſhould not regret at any other Time but as Lady BETTY<note n="*" place="bottom">The late Ducheſs of NORTHUMBERLAND.</note> is to lie in, and is
already gone a Month paſt her Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhould like to be nearer to
her. I was not eight and forty Hours in Town, when I went to be preſented, on
my Lord's new Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and to make my Appearance on the Birth-Day; for I went
from hence at Seven on the <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, and was preſented that
Day at Noon, and on the <hi>Monday,</hi> as ſoon as the Drawing-Room was
over, undreſſed and came back directly. I lay at Sir HUGH SMITHSON's, for I
could not have a Room at <hi>Northumberland-Houſe,</hi> and I have never
ſeen <hi>London</hi> ſince. We have the moſt glorious Weather that I
believe was ever ſeen in Winter: but, alas! I can only admire it from my
Windows, being under Dr. SHAW's Hands, for the ill Conſequence of a Fall,
which I had before I went to <hi>Bath,</hi> by a Servant heedleſsly taking
away a Chair, juſt as I was going to ſit down, and which I took too little
Care of at firſt, ſo I am now forbid all Sort of Exerciſe, which gives me
but a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Proſpect, as to my Health, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but God's Will
be done! and I hope I <pb n="109" facs="tcp:1173200201:127"/> ſhall chearfully ſubmit to the
Event, whatever it be.</p>
            <p>Have you ſeen a little <hi>French</hi> Book called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeils
à une Amie,</hi> ſaid to be written by Madame de POMPADOUR: the Name
of the Author will not induce you to expect any very exalted Sentiments of
Religion or Morality; but it contains good Rules for making a proper Figure in
High-Life. I have alſo had the Letters of Monſieur RACINE LE PERE, and
ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of his Life, by his Son, lent me; and they give me a greater
Eſteem for him as a Man, than as the Author of <hi>Eſter and Athaliah.</hi>
I hope you have ſeen my old Acquaintance, the Miniſter of B—'s
Anſwer to Dr. MIDDLETON's <hi>Free Enquiry about Miracles.</hi> I cannot
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how he can reply to it, without owning himſelf a Deiſt, or
explaining ſome of his Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endos in a different Way to what they appear at
firſt Sight. Mr. and Mrs. WYMONDESOLD's handſome Behaviour to you, dear
Madam, gives me a good Opinion of them both. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall never have
reaſon to alter that which I have formed of my Lord L— for ſome Years
paſt; and as to that I ſtrove to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1173200201:128"/> of him
before, 'twas the Work of Art, and a <hi>Contre-coeur.</hi> As to your Son, I
think he does not act of himſelf. I am ſorry to hear Mr. SHENSTONE has been
ſo ill, but I hope his Muſe has not left him; I am ſure yours has not; I
am confident ſhe attended you very agreeably upon his Bench. Mr. LINDSEY, my
Lord's Chaplain, (who by the Way is a very good Judge, and a pretty Sort of
Man) prefers his Ode on Autumn to almoſt every modern Performance. My Lord

            <p>I Return you a Multitude of Thanks for the Favour of your laſt
Letter to me. I think you ſeem to have had as ſolitary a Winter as we have
at <hi>Broom.</hi> This is the Seaſon a Town Life is vaſtly preferable to
that of the Country; the Country now is only fit for Poachers and Game-keepers.
Like old DARBY and JOAN, we live now upon the Thoughts of paſt Pleaſures; 
<q> 
                  <l>In fondly meditating o'er</l> 
                  <l>Paſt Pleaſures, and in hoping more.</l>
               </q> However, we have
two Amuſements which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail us, and thoſe are Reading and Muſic. In
order that we may enjoy the latter in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Degree than we have done of
late, we have got Mr. G— over ſometimes, you know, who has procured us
a new Spinnet, and he ſays, <pb n="112" facs="tcp:1173200201:130"/> he'll make us proficient
in the Art of Muſic preſently, provided we will but be diligent.</p>
            <p>I have ſent for the Pamphlet that is wrote againſt Mr.
G—'s Compoſitions. As he's my Maſter, I have a Curioſity to it. He
ſays, it pulls him all to Pieces. I can't tell what Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius he has for
compoſing Muſic, but certainly he's a very good Muſic-Maſter. As a
Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I do not much admire him: I think he's a diſagreeable Man; very
mercenary; always full of Eſteem for himſelf, and of Contempt for all
others; and does not conſider, that it is almoſt as glorious to acknowledge
Merit in other Perſons, as to have it oneſelf: but he ſets good
Leſſons, ſo I'll bear with him; as Lord FOPPINGTON tells his
Shoemaker—

               </q> I know not of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word that
would be proper here beſides Recommendation, which is greatly inferior. I

<hi>Proſe,</hi> and I dare ſay your Ladyſhip (who <pb n="115" facs="tcp:1173200201:133"/>
knows ſo well all the Beauties of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) is alſo not unacquainted
with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of it; by which Means you find yourſelf ſo well
enabled to diſguiſe the latter, at the ſame Time that you are
diſplaying the former. Notwithſtanding the ſuppoſed Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of
the GLUMS and the GAWRIES ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites one's Curioſity, the Book does not, I
think, deſerve a Place in your Ladyſhip's Library, and I would not have you
purchaſe it. It makes two Volumes in 12mo. Price 6s. It came into my Way,
ſo I read it, giving it juſt Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to let it amuſe me with
the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Scenes it deſcribes. As to what I ſaid of the
<hi>Scribbleriad,</hi> you will obſerve, I had read nothing but a few
Quotations, and am now to requeſt your Ladyſhip's Opinion, who have
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Book. Believe me, my Lady, I am not lazy in <hi>Mind.</hi> I long
for nothing ſo much as bodily Health and Spirits, to be able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
myſelf better of my Share of the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, and to deſerve the
Vivacity of yours ſomewhat more than I do. But when I ſhall be able to
exchange the Cypreſs Grove for the more agreeable Verdure of the Myrtle or
the Laurel, is a Queſtion I cannot pretend to ſolve—Very 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1173200201:134"/> pedantic truly this!—But to proceed: I wrote many
ludicrous Things at College, and in the former Part of my Life, and one or two
of theſe am I thinking to encloſe during this inſipid Seaſon; perhaps
taking, like Woodcocks, the Advantage of a Fog, they may hope at ſuch a Time
for ſomething better Quarter, though, to ſpeak the Truth, they are much too
ſilly, and your Judgment too penetrating, to give them any Room for ſuch an
Expectation. As to printing, I will not ſay that I never intend it, but I
muſt firſt be able to ſpend a few Weeks with my Friend GRAVES, who is a
Perſon of great Delicacy, and whoſe Friendſhip may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, induce him
to examine my Trifles with ſome Attention, no very agreeable Taſk to him or
any one elſe. Mean Time, the Complaint you make of your preſent Want of
Amuſement, gives me an Occaſion to pour in Floods of my <hi>written</hi>
Impertinence. The <hi>Progreſs of Taſte</hi> I meant to ſhew you long
ago. The <hi>Snuff-Box</hi> (which by interweaving another Poem or two, is now,
I ſee, a mere Piece of Patch-Work) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears before you for no other Reaſon
in the World, but that it happens to be tranſcribed in the ſame Book with
the former; and is intereſted <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1173200201:135"/> in my deſiring you not
to read a Line of it. I ſend alſo the Ode I firſt mentioned to the
Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">"<hi>Rural Elegance,</hi>" an Ode to the
late Ducheſs of SOMERSET. See SHENSTONE's Works, Vol. i, Page 105.</note> and
would aſk, in the firſt Place, whether it <hi>deſerves</hi> Correction?
If you would not chooſe I ſhould immediately deſtroy it, will you be ſo
Kind as to mark any Improprieties, or propoſe any Improvements to me? I hope
you will be in no concern about defacing the Copy, in that Caſe, for I would
write it over ever ſo often, if I could by that Means add a Syllable that was
more expreſſive of my Veneration for her Grace, or that tended to give her
a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Amuſement. I calculated the <hi>Subject</hi> as well as I could;
but I am fearful you will diſcover nothing but common-place Thoughts. I think
moſt of my Verſes ſmell of nothing but Field-Flowers, and conſidering
how I ſpend my Time, they can ſcarce do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>A Word more, in regard to the propoſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in your Room.
If your Ladyſhip does not chooſe to go to the Expence of a carved Frame,
what think you of a white oval Frame to your Glaſs in the middle, and a
Feſtoon on <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1173200201:136"/> each Side; this with the Stucco need amount
to no more than four Guineas. But the Room is mighty well as it <hi>is,</hi>
and you are yourſelf the Judge, whether the Expence of the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would
afford you an anſwerable Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I am greatly pleaſed with what your
Ladyſhip mentions of coming to the <hi>Leaſowes</hi>; for tho' you will
ſee but little new this Year, yet by allowing yourſelf ſome little Time,
you will ſee the ſame with much greater Eaſe than you could before; and
if I ſhould add, Pleaſure, I hope you will allow it to my Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for a
Place that has engroſſed my Care ſo long. You complain, Madam, of the
Want of freſh Ideas, (which I never yet obſerved in your Converſation or
Letters at any Time or Tide) gueſs, however, what muſt be <hi>my</hi>
Caſe, who ſee nothing from Day to Day but 
<q> 
                  <l>Bleak Mountains and wild ſtaring Rocks,</l> 
                  <l>The wretched Reſult of my Pains;</l> 
                  <l>The Swains, greater Brutes than their Flocks,</l>

               <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Haſten to acquaint your Ladyſhip, that my Brother is now
greatly better, and, is, we all hope, in a fair Way of Recovery.</p>
            <p>What ſmall Hopes I have entertained for moſt Part of the Time
ſince I wrote laſt to <hi>Barrels,</hi> have been rather owing to a Kind of
Self-Flattery, and an Unwillingneſs to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, than any proper
Foundation—but theſe three Days, his Diſorder is ſo much abated,
that they ſeem to receive ſome Sanction from <hi>Reaſon</hi>; not that I
am entirely free from Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. The aſthmatical Diſorder is fallen
down into his Legs, where it continues at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But what by Means of
Aſs's Milk, which agrees with him, the Advantage of a few Days, in which he
has been carried Sedan-Faſhion <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1173200201:138"/> about my Grounds, and
the moſt ſcrupulous Care, in regard to what we ſuffer him to eat or
drink, his Spirits, Pulſe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion are aſtoniſhingly recovered,
and his Strength and Stomach proportionably reſtored.</p>
            <p>I will not detain your Ladyſhip any longer on this Head, than to
acquaint you, that I have thought about writing to <hi>Barrels</hi> every Day
ſince your Servant was here; but finding all along, ſuch frequent Changes
in the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and being utterly incapable to give your Ladyſhip any
<hi>ſatisfactory</hi> Account, I had not the Spirit to ſet Pen to
Paper.</p>
            <p>This has been to me the moſt diſagreeable Seaſon, for a
Continuance, I ever ſpent in my Life; betwixt ſleepleſs Nights, painful
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, conſtant Solicitude, Confinement, and an entire Alteration
in regard to my Way of Life, I found my own Situation not a little endangered:
but as the original Cauſe begins to ceaſe, I hope the Effect will. I might
have added to the former Vexations, the Difficulty of procuring good Advice,
and the no leſs Difficulty of prevailing on my Brother to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low 
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1173200201:139"/> it. Such Perſons as he ought always to be well; I
mean, to guard more than <hi>others</hi> againſt Diſeaſes, as they have
ſo little Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in reſerve to ſubmit to the Means of Cure.</p>
            <p>But to lead your Ladyſhip from the ſick Room into the open Air a
little—I am now beginning, for the firſt Time, to bruſh up my Walks.
The Trees and Shrubs are in full Bloom all of a ſudden; I mean, ſo far as
concerns the green Leaves, for the latter have not yet flowered. The Servants
are now very buſy in cleaning my Grove, &amp;c. whither I ſtray now two or
three Times a Day, with great Complacency. I doubt the Death of poor Mr.
H—LL's Brother will occaſion him much worldly Perplexity, as well as
Concern, at preſent: I would otherwiſe preſs him to ſpend a Week with
me at the <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> as ſome Kind of Relief to him, and a great
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to us. I think a Change of Place, after ſuch an Affliction, is
very often of no ſmall Service. That Book of Mr. PEARSALL's which your
Ladyſhip ſubſcribed for, is come out, I hear, but I have had no Copies
ſent yet. Your <pb n="122" facs="tcp:1173200201:140"/> Ladyſhip, I know, intended to oblige
<hi>me</hi> by your Subſcription, and THAT Point you can never fail to
obtain—more I am not at Liberty to ſay. You will pleaſe to mention
this Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Mr. H—LL; I ſent <hi>his</hi> Name, tho' I am not
<hi>ſure</hi> that he ſubſcribed: but I know he would be the readieſt
of Men to ſerve an old Schoolfellow. Would your Ladyſhip be ſo Kind as to
lend me POMPEY <hi>the Little?</hi> I have read, as I ſaid before, nothing
but Phyſic-Books for theſe laſt ſix Weeks, and I want now to be
indulged with ſomewhat more amuſing. I won't pretend to your Ladyſhip
that I am a very great <hi>Phyſician,</hi> but I conſider myſelf as
qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to make the beſt <hi>Nurſe</hi> of any body in the three
Kingdoms. I hope ſoon to be able to adjuſt a Time, when I may have the
long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhed-for Happineſs of waiting on your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at the
<hi>Leaſowes.</hi> In the mean Time, I am to return my Brother's Thanks with
my own, for every obliging Inſtance of your Regard, and to ſubſcribe
myſelf inviolably</p>

               <p>P. S. <hi>May</hi> 25. I ſhould have ſent the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Account yeſterday, when it was wrote; but I find nothing to add hitherto,
that may <hi>diſcolour</hi> the favourable Relation I have been giving of my
Brother's Recovery. I <hi>will</hi> yet hope that there is ſome good in
reſerve for us, which may in <hi>ſome Meaſure,</hi> compenſate for the
gloomy Seaſon we have paſt—I don't know from what Quarter, but I'll
ſtill confide—I hope your Ladyſhip does.</p>
               <p>I did not propoſe to do <hi>much</hi> about my Houſe this
Year, and I now ſhall do <hi>nothing.</hi> But I know your Ladyſhip will
find ſome Pleaſure in the Conjecture, that the Money which might have been
expended upon Rooms or Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, has been ſpent with ſome Effect upon my
Brother's Recovery; without which, the <hi>Leaſowes</hi> would have afforded
no Pleaſure of one while. I hope, with this good Weather, your Ladyſhip's
wonted Spirits will return; I hope, alſo, that I ſhall henceforth be able
to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with you upon more agreeable Subjects than I could of late.
Miſs DOLMAN deſired her Compliments when ſhe was here laſt, which 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1173200201:142"/> was about a Week ago. I cannot yet write with any Sort
of Spirit; ſo I will relieve your Ladyſhip at once from ſo many inſipid
Nothings, as I ſhould probably add if I proceeded.</p>

            <p>I Return you the Collection of Poems, which you were ſo kind as to
ſend me, and can but acknowledge myſelf very much obliged to you for the
Peruſal of them.</p>
            <p>If I did not expect the Pleaſure of ſeeing them ſoon again in
print, I ſhould have parted with them into your Hands with vaſt
Reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without having taken the Liberty of tranſcribing ſome of them
for my Amuſement hereafter: but ſomething whiſpers me in my Ear, that you

and that they will no longer be concealed in the little ſecret Box, from
whence I remember I was ſo rude as to ſteal them.</p>
            <p>Sometime before my Lord DUDLEY ſets out for <hi>London,</hi> my

<hi>Broom,</hi> and we hope too, that you and your Brother will accompany them
there, whenever they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us the Honour of a Viſit.</p>
            <p>I came Home from the <hi>Grange</hi> ſo much ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with the
Concert I heard there, that the Deſire I had before of being a Performer in
ſuch a one has, if poſſible, taken a deeper Root. CLARENDON calls
Ambition a Weed, which, he ſays, is apt to grow in the beſt Soils, ſo I
will not be wholly void of it; I will be ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of attaining to ſome
Knowledge of two Things, namely, Muſic and the <hi>French</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and
in order to do the latter, I believe my Brother and I ſhall be ſo very
extravagant, as to have a <hi>French</hi> Maſter attend us at <hi>Broom,</hi>
as frequently as we have G—M to teach as Muſic now.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I HAD wrote to your Ladyſhip long before this Time, to acknowledge
the Kindneſs of your Letter and Preſent: but I have a moſt deplorable
Account to give of my Delay, and what ſo good a Friend as yourſelf will not
read without a Sigh. Alas, dear Madam, I have loſt my only Brother! A more
ſincere or truly affectionate one never bore the Name. I cannot now add more;
tho' I ſhould not want Matter to expatiate upon his Merit, if I were not at
the ſame Time to revive and lament the Loſs of it. He is gone <hi>before
me</hi> in the very Prime of his Days, and ere the Force of his
Underſtanding, or the Benevolence of his Heart has been half exerted or
known.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:1173200201:146"/>Future Letters, and other Converſations, may
afford me an Opportunity to pour out all my Soul; at preſent, I am not enough
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of myſelf. I find all my Views intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: my Schemes,
Meaſures, and even my Heart itſelf, to be well nigh broken. I have loſt
that Spirit of a Man, which alone is able to ſuſtain his Infirmities. Every
Object round me, that was once the Source of my Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, revives a Train
of Ideas that I can hardly render ſupportable. I procure a Set of low Friends
to chat around me, and call off my Attention. But the greateſt Relief I have
found, ſince the fatal Cloſe of <hi>November,</hi> is what I have drawn
from Stupefaction.</p>
            <p>Pardon me, my good Lady; I do not mean to make a Diſplay of my
Affliction. I mention it, that you may account for, and excuſe any
Omiſſions or Improprieties in your unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Correſpondent.</p>
            <p>Since this unhappy Cataſtrophe, it has been my Lot to hear of one
that muſt nearly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect your Ladyſhip. Believe me, my honoured Lady, I am
far from an unconcerned Obſerver <pb n="129" facs="tcp:1173200201:147"/> of Events, that
muſt afford you either Pleaſure or Pain. But I am not in a Condition to
<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> Relief, and how can I pretend to <hi>give</hi> it? One Thing,
however, I will ſuggeſt—I think <hi>CAESAR</hi> confeſſed at an
earlier Period of Life than what my Lord BOLINGBROKE arrived at, that he had
lived enough, either in regard to Nature or to Glory.</p>
            <p>During the Height of our Afflictions, we can ſcarce believe it
poſſible they ſhould ever wear off. In my Caſe, there are ſome
Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which render it improbable they ſhould. Yet Time, we find,
alleviates the Misfortunes of others, and it is fitting we ſhould hope
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, that it may ſome how diminiſh our own.</p>
            <p>I will excuſe your Ladyſhip from dwelling upon the Subject.
Aſſure me only of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of your Eſteem, and it will be of
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Service than whole Volumes of Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Pray be ſo good as to write or dictate a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me. I

Week, when I hear you are come down, but I have had a Kind of nervous Fever,

            </opener>
            <p>MR. GRAVES has lately ſet me right as to a Miſtake, which
otherwiſe I might have remained in much longer. As I hope to live, I had
quite forgot my Promiſe of writing to you from <hi>London,</hi> and ſo
wondered I did not hear from you. But upon his men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning it, I immediately,
to my great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, recollected my Error. I felt a great deal of
Uneaſineſs, while I imagined the Fault to lie at your Door; but I
aſſure you, much more, ſince I find it to be at my own. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude is
what I moſt abhor; and I muſt be a Monſter, to ſlight ſuch a Favour
as your laſt to me, and from ſuch a Friend. Pray believe me incapable of
it, or of poſſeſſing a ſerene Mind, while there ſhould be any
Miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding between you and me. I am like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſincerely
concerned for the Death of your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially as Mr. GRAVES ſays, it
touched <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1173200201:150"/> you ſo nearly, conſequently I ſhould
adviſe you to change the Place a little after ſo melancholy an Affair; and
I am ſure you can find in no Place, <hi>one</hi> who would be more
ſolicitous to divert you than at <hi>Whitchurch.</hi> I can't aſk that
Favour of you, becauſe I am ſo much in Debt to you already. But it would
give me a double Pleaſure, ſince I believe at preſent it might be
beneficial to you. For my own Part, I long to wait on you; but my Mother's
State of Health is ſo bad, that I muſt not think of gratifying that
Paſſion this Summer; tho' I can hardly lay that Hope aſide, or forbear
ſaying, that a ſmall Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in her for the better would make me
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it. I have got a little Chaiſe, which at preſent I am much
pleaſed with, and I aſſure you, its Wheels have a natural
<hi>Penchant</hi> to run to the <hi>Leaſowes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh'd for you much at <hi>London.</hi> Plays are well worth
ſeeing now. I reckon thoſe who can't be pleaſed with the preſent
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the Stage, are too delicate ever to be pleaſed. There are a
great many very good Actors, and ſome (GARRICK and Mrs. CIBBER) acknowledged
to exceed all that ever <pb n="133" facs="tcp:1173200201:151"/> have been. You muſt come once
more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, I mean to <hi>London</hi>; I am ſure it will do you
good: I find the Benefit of it myſelf; Change of Place gives me Spirits for
the Year, which, I find, fail me very much without—Don't let us grow old
if we can help it; and I think Variety and new Scenes are the moſt likely to
keep us young, at leaſt produce the Effects of Youth. I own Life is dull at
beſt, and therefore it is the wiſeſt Way to vary it as much as
poſſible. The moſt ſtupid Vulgar (both high and low) find their Account
in this Method. Then you muſt find a double Pleaſure in it, who know how to
vary it ſo elegantly, as to entertain others as well as yourſelf. I
aſſure you, you ſucceeded ſo well as to the firſt, when you were
here, that your Praiſes are ſtill blooming; the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Impreſſion
ſtill remains on all. I long to ſee you, and hope to hear from you. Pray
harbour no ill Thought of me, for if I have erred, it was, I aſſure you,
from Miſtake or Forgetfulneſs, and not with Intention. I never did, nor
ever can, mean Ill or Diſrepect to dear Mr. SHENSTONE, but ſhall ever be
his moſt ſincere Friend and humble Servant,</p>

            <p>MY Converſation, dear Lady LUXBOROUGH, is by no Means equal to the
Reception I find at <hi>Barrels,</hi> and if you return me Thanks upon
<hi>that</hi> Score, you make me doubly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how unable I am to make a
due Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement.</p>
            <p>The Day after I left <hi>Barrels,</hi> I had a Morning Viſit from
Admiral SMITH, Captain WHOOD, Mrs. STANLEY, and her two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who engaged
me to dine with Sir G. <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1173200201:153"/> LYTTELTON. Theſe are Ladies of
Taſte, I think; but Admiral SMITH is the Delight of Mankind! I forgot to
mention Mr. MILLER, who ſeems to recommend my Walks with great Cordiality. I
ſee they condeſcend to look upon <hi>modern</hi> Plans at <hi>Hagley,</hi>
and if they build anew, I ſuppoſe it will be in that Style.</p>
            <p>Since this I have ſeen a good deal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, more of whom
arrive to ſee my <hi>Walks</hi> than <hi>me</hi>; yet I am not jealous or
invidious: my Walks are truly more deſerving of this Favour.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday, I had the Company of Miſs LEA, and Mr. HILTON, a very
modeſt and ingenious Man, who came with Lord DUD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY from <hi>London</hi>;
beſides two other Parties of Viſitants, who engroſſed my whole Day.</p>
            <p>And now I ſit down by <hi>Five</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to anſwer
your Queries concerning the <hi>Papier-Machée.</hi> It is bought of Mr.
BROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WICH, at the <hi>Golden-Lion,</hi> upon <hi>Ludgate-Hill.</hi> What you
will want, will be an Ornament <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1173200201:154"/> for the Middle, and four
Spandrells for the Corners. I have taken down the Pine-Apple from the middle of
my Cieling, and ſend it you to ſee, together with ſome other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which were never yet fixed up. They will coſt (I mean a middle and four
corner Ornaments) ſomewhere about eight Shillings. You may ornament it
<hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> tho' as you pleaſe. As to the Cracks of your
Cieling, (which I don't remember) if they are not violently bad, they may be
mended by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maſon, and the <hi>Colour</hi> will diſguiſe them. As
for putting them up, I will ſend you over a very agreeable Neighbour of mine,
who was once an eminent Upholſterer, but now lives upon his Fortune, who
ſeems glad of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity it will give him to ſee <hi>Barrels,</hi>
and the Honour it will afford him of being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to your Ladyſhip.
They ſhould be painted with Flake White and thin Starch; but all this he will
manage to your entire Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. He is a Perſon of Taſte, has ſeen a
good deal of Life; and tho' he has had his Share of Difficulties, always
chearful. You muſt not offer him any Thing. Thus have I been as ſhort as I
can, in pointing out <pb n="137" facs="tcp:1173200201:155"/> your quickeſt Method of
embelliſhing your Cieling. The whole Cove (except the Moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) ſhould be
waſhed with Oker; but this you may defer, if you pleaſe, till Mr. PIXELL
arrives.</p>
            <p>I beg my Thanks to Mrs. WEYMONDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLD, for her kind Remembrance of
me: am a little fearful her Viſit will be too late in the Year; but 'tis in
Mrs. WEYMONDESOLD's Power to make <hi>all</hi> Seaſons pleaſing.</p>
            <p>My Lord DUDLEY will be extremely glad to wait on Mr. OUTING: but he
muſt come hither firſt, and we will adjuſt the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>I have taken the Liberty to ſend this by my Servant Girl, who is
deſirous to ſee her Siſter and <hi>Barrels</hi>; and really my Man is
ſo much Aſſiſtant in the Way of fitting up my Room (which engages me)
that I could very ill ſpare him.</p>
            <p>I hope Mr. PRICE is recovered, by the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you make of his going
again to <hi>London.</hi> I <pb n="138" facs="tcp:1173200201:156"/> did not merely aſk, but
wiſh to ſee him here. And now I muſt leave your Ladyſhip for the
Company of my Carpenters; yet am ever <hi>uniformly</hi> your Ladyſhip's

            <p>AS I promiſed to write to you ſoon, I hope you will excuſe the
Haſte and Errors of this Epiſtle. I was almoſt wet through before I
reached <hi>Birmingham</hi> laſt <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> where I eat a Mouthful
of Dinner at my Inn, and proceeded to <hi>Solihull:</hi> there I ſtopt, and
was told by the Landlady, I ſhould be too late for the Races at
<hi>Warwick,</hi> if I did not make haſte. I thanked her, and proceeded to 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1173200201:157"/> Mr. WREN's, who gave me a very friendly Reception, and
aſked me to ſtay all Night, which I immediately accepted. We walked and
talked much; he praiſed Gloom and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and I fine Proſpects: not but
that (I told him) ſometimes I could reliſh a <hi>grave</hi> Scene, and lo!
he opens a Door, and turned me into the Church-Yard, which he ſaid was full
of <hi>Graves,</hi> and deſired me to tell you the ſame. Great Alterations
might be made there, which he will never do. Next Day, after Breakfaſt, I
took my Leave, and reached <hi>Warwick,</hi> and yeſterday came hither. I
fear my Buſineſs cannot be ended before the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of next Week, as it
is Aſſize-Time, and my Brother is but in an indifferent State of Health. I
have wrote thus far, and find my Pen can ſcrawl nothing but what is as
inſipid as myſelf. Lord WILLOUGHBY DE BROOKE is dead. The Diſtemper is
amongſt the Cattle here. Lord BROOKE is at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and has locked
up the Caſtle Gardens.</p>
            <p>I have not been at <hi>Coventry</hi> yet; neither do I intend to
enter often into a Place ſo dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to thoſe ſylvan
Scenes I <pb n="140" facs="tcp:1173200201:158"/> was entertained with at the

ſpend my Life in Idleneſs, and wonder I have paſſed another Year
without ſetting up in my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Sordid wretches! whoſe only God is
Gold. How deſpicable muſt Life appear, when it has paſt away only in
collecting a Heap of ſhining Cinders! My Reſolutions are more ſtrongly
attached than ever to retire. When I come over, I purpoſe to talk with Mr.
SHAW about <hi>Palmer's-Hill,</hi> which, if not much out of the Way, I will
purchaſe. I ſhould be glad, when you meet any of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you would

               <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM extremely ſorry for the Accident which prevented my having
the Pleaſure of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from you, and ſincerely hope you have overcome all
the ill Effects of it. You are very obliging in the Concern you expreſs, for
the Scenes of Sorrow I have paſſed through. I have, indeed, ſuffered
deeply; but when I <pb n="142" facs="tcp:1173200201:160"/> conſider it is the Will of God, who
never cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſes his poor Creatures but for their Good, and reflect, at the
ſame Time, how unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy I was of theſe Bleſſings, which I now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Loſs of, I lay my Hand upon my Mouth and dare not repine; but I hope can
with Truth appeal to him in the following Words: 
<q>Queſto affano ei ſu che non ſi oppone al ſuo ſanto
voler: Chio gemo e gli affro tutti il ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miti miei Chio Rango &amp; in tanto
Benedico il ſuo Nome in Mezzo al Pianto.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You are ſo good, as to wiſh my Solitude may afford me ſome
Amuſement; and as I think it a Duty, while it pleaſes God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue us
here, not to let ourſelves ſink into a ſtupid and unthankful Melancholy,
I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to find out ſuch Entertainments, as my Retirement, and my dear
Lord's unmerited Bounty will admit of. I have built a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Lodge at my
Gate, and am now turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the long Drawing-Room into a Chapel, which will be
finiſhed in the Gothic Taſte, and have three fine painted Windows; theſe
I <pb n="143" facs="tcp:1173200201:161"/> had beſpoke for <hi>Northumberland-Houſe,</hi> but
as its preſent Owners do not intend that their Chapel ſhall be in the
ſame Place that we had propoſed, they would not have fitted there. The Room
where you were ſo good as to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with us, and my Lord's Bed-chamber,
I could not bear to go into ſince my <hi>irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Misfortune, and
therefore, with Lord NOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THUMBERLAND's Advice, have laid them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which
will make a Room of 35 by 21. I ſhall put up a very pretty Chimney-Piece in
it with Paper, on which I ſhall hang my beſt Pictures.</p>
            <p>The Seaſon for ſome little Alterations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors is now
coming on, and I intend ſome Change in my Roſary, and Openings in other
Parts of the Park. I have alſo erected a little Hermitage in one of the Woods
near the Canal, whoſe Roof is thatched, and its Walls of Straw. I read as
uſual, and have lately been much pleaſed with the new Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of SULLY's
<hi>Memoirs.</hi> Beſides this, my own Servant and myſelf have worked five
croſs-ſtitch Chairs, and intend three more for my Chapel; they are a Gothic
Moſaic, in fine Crimſon, and are to have Gothic Frames. 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1173200201:162"/> Thus, dear Madam, I have given you an Account of my
Schemes and Occupations. My Company, at preſent, conſiſts of Dr. LE
COURAYET, Mr. COWSLAD, and my Chaplain, who is a modeſt, ſenſible and
truly pious young Man. The Gentleman who travelled with poor Lord BEAUCHAMP has
been with me two Months, but left me yeſterday. What is come to Lord
LUXBOROUGH, or rather to his Son? And why is poor Mrs. WYMONDESOLD to be
treated as an Alien? I conclude ſhe did not marry without her Father's
Conſent.</p>
            <p>I hear an extreme good Character of your Nephew, Lord ST. JOHN,
which I am ſure will give you Pleaſure. I muſt do Lord EGRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONT the
Juſtice to tell you, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any one to behave in a
more kind and handſome Manner, than he has done ever ſince my dreadful
Loſs; but Mrs. O—N has never taken the leaſt Notice of me. Lord and

            </opener>
            <p>THE Letter with which you favoured me deſerves my earlieſt
Acknowledgments, and will prove not a little ſerviceable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the
Subſcription we have in Hand. The whole Account of that Affair is as
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: I had been aſſured by Perſons of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, (amongſt which I
may ſafely name Lord DUDLEY, Mr. PIXELL, and THO. COT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEREL) that you had
generouſly made an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of twenty Guineas towards the Addition of two new
Bells to our preſent Set; and that in Caſe the Pariſh would ſupply what
was wanting, it would be a Pleaſure to you, Sir, to have your Offer accepted.
Upon this Encouragement, I determined to make Trial what a Subſcription would
produce, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly drew up a Form for that Purpoſe; intending to write
you an Account of the <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1173200201:164"/> Undertaking, ſo ſoon as I
could form a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of its Succeſs. This I was upon the Point of doing,
when I had the Pleaſure of a Letter from you, which, nevertheleſs, was
extremely ſeaſonable, as it immediately removed a Doubt that began to
ſpread, in Regard to your Concurrence.</p>
            <p>There is now ſubſcribed, (excluſive of your Benefaction) the
Sum of fifty Guineas; and I make no Scruple of raiſing twenty more, by an
Application to ſuch Perſons as have not yet been ſolicited. Be our
Progreſs what it will, I purpoſe in a few Weeks to give you a farther
Account of it; in the mean Time, can aſſure you, that the Subſcription
will be puſhed forward with all poſſible Diligence, that it may give us
the earlier Chance for the Pleaſure of your Company. I have only to add, that
the Bells will never ſound more agreeably, than when they ring for your
Arrival; will be heard no where more advantageouſly than from ſome Parts of
my Farm, and that you will find no one more deſirous of making the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

            <p>YOUR two laſt Epiſtles, of the 4th and 9th Inſtant, merit
greater Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than the trifling Return of mine. I am going upon an
Expedition in a few Hours, yet muſt not neglect aſſuring you, how
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I think myſelf indebted to your Care and Informations relative to my
Tenants, and beg, if they apply to you again, to tell them, I have lately had a
Letter from Mr. I—, who has promiſed me to be down at Lady-Day, and
ſettle Affairs with them all. The Brickman's Bill is much higher than I
thought it would have been. Believe me, between Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Builders I am
almoſt wearied out of my Life, and ſincerely wiſh myſelf diſengaged
from them, eſpecially the former; I hope they may be the laſt Set of People

            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1173200201:166"/>The Malady you complain of at preſent is
not, I conjecture, ſo much owing to the Winter, as to Solitude; Cold braces
and Heat relaxes. Could you have in Winter the ſame Round of Company and
enchanting Scenes that you enjoy in Summer, your Nerves would, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
be ſtronger, and your Spirits more alert. Your Friends (more particularly
myſelf) ought to think ourſelves much obliged to you for that ſmall
Palliative you adminiſter to your languid Hours, in thinking of, or writing
to us. I could cure you much better by a Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of Madame DE

univerſal <hi>Panacea,</hi> might prove a Reſtorative. I think myſelf
very happy in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Opportunity of conveying to you, (according to
Promiſe) what ſhe ſays of you in her Letter to me, which I ſhall do in
her own Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"Pray tell the <hi>Salopian</hi> Bard, that 'tis my

that I could not declare myſelf in any one's Favour.</p>
            <p>Mr. CHEEK I have not lately ſeen. Mr. OUTING and ſelf ſet out
this Day for <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's-Green,</hi> to make a Viſit to our honeſt
Friend CHARLES WALKER, where we hope to arrive before this Letter does at
<hi>Lombard-Street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, Miſs LEA, Mrs. ROCK, and her Daughter, all join in
Compliments and good Wiſhes to you. They are in tolerable good Health,
excepting now and then catching Cold. I had the Pleaſure of the three laſt
to Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with me yeſterday Morning.</p>
            <p>Mr. O— has often been ſolicited by me to write to you, which
he ſincerely ſays he intends when we return to <hi>London</hi> next Week,
and with his Compliments, hopes you will forgive the ſeeming Neglect he has
been guilty of. His going to ſleep at the <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> and my
accompanying him therein, has been often <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1173200201:169"/> Matter of
Diſcourſe between us. He declares, he will ſoon write a Panegyric upon
Sleep, and the Benefit ariſing from the unreſtrained Occupation of one's
own Bed.</p>
            <p>I can furniſh you with few Particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mrs. W—'s
Amour. All I know is, her Huſband and other People had ocular Demonſtration
of her Guilt, by a Servant Boy's boring three Holes in the Wainſcot, which
were afterwards cut in one. I am myſelf ſorry to ſee a Perſon
poſſeſſed of amiable and noble Qualities, ſo much ſunk by one fatal
Error; and much greater is her Fall, when the <hi>leſs</hi> malicious Part of
the World condemn her, and declare her Foible of no late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement. Mr.
O— tells me, Mr. K— (though I ſhould little have thought it)
wears a <hi>triſte</hi> Viſage on this Occaſion, and whimpers that he is
much concerned.</p>
            <p>Your Glaſs is done, and I have got the gold Claſp back from the
Chaſer's. Do let me procure you ſomething, if it is but in Silver, which
perhaps you may like as well, and be Money in Pocket.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1173200201:170"/>DODSLEY's Man told me, Mr. GRAY's Poems would
come out in about three Weeks. The <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> is a fine
Tragedy; I have ſeen it, and the <hi>Rival Brothers,</hi> but do not like the
Plot of the laſt. I am now reading the <hi>Memoirs of Sir Charles
Goodville,</hi> in two Volumes; they are contained in a Series of Letters
relative to his Family, and I think ſome of them pathetic and engaging.
FRANCIS either has, or ſoon will publiſh a new Play.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Tragedy of <hi>Eugenia,</hi> replete with Delicacy,

            </p>
            <p>I have heard SOUTHWELL is now in Place, at his own Trade, and hope
he'll do well. I am really glad my poor Patient is happily married, and hope
ſhe will not relapſe any more into a bad State of Health. I ſhall be much
obliged to you, for the Verſes you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me to Mr. W. LYTTELTON, and
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall like them full as well as thoſe you deſigned for the
Colonel, becauſe more friendly than panegyrical.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHILST your Ladyſhip's Spirits appear as perennial as your Genius,
I have a deplorable Account to give you of my own. They have been, in ſhort,
but few Degrees better than they were the laſt fatal Winter: and though I was
conſcious what <hi>apparent</hi> Cauſe I gave you to be angry with my
Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, I could not bear the Thoughts of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering ſo polite a Letter as
your laſt, with an Heart dejected, and a Head equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Les Morts n'ecrivent point,</hi>"</q> ſays
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame MAINTENON, 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>&amp; je me comptois de leur

            </p>
            <p>Suffer me to thank you here, Madam, for the very ſtriking
Amuſement I received from thoſe Letters; I read them twice, and as I 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1173200201:174"/> have ſullied the Copy you were ſo good to lend me, I
will ſend another I beſpoke for myſelf, as ſoon as it arrives.</p>
            <p>The Memoirs of Lord BOLINGBROKE's Life abound too much with
Politicks for <hi>me.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>World</hi> alſo would be as
well pleaſed with the more private Anecdotes of ſo great a Man. Herein your
Ladyſhip would ſhine; and I could wiſh you to engage in ſomething of
this Kind, though ever ſo ſhort; if not for the Public, at leaſt as an
Amuſement to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Friends, and a Legacy to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Lord
BOLINGBROKE, or whom elſe you ſhould prefer.</p>
            <p>Now I have begun to mention Books, let me finiſh the Subject. The
<hi>Gameſter</hi> I have read no more of, than what I gleaned from the
Quotations in the Magazines. I never yet had any Opinion of the Genius of Mr.
MOORE, and I hardly think I ſhall alter my Sentiments, on Account of this
Performance. The <hi>Moral,</hi> however, muſt be allowed to be extremely
ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:1173200201:175"/>The <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> I have read;
the <hi>unfortunate</hi> Earl of ESSEX! whoſe Story, whatever it may
deſerve, has never yet produced a good Line, and now hardly ever will, yet I
am willing, with your Ladyſhip, to make all Allowances for the Writer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Brothers,</hi> which I have alſo read, is a noble Tragedy,
full of refined and elevated Sentiments, and, generally ſpeaking, of
ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expreſſions. I am not blind to many of its Faults—but I
have read nothing of late Years that has <hi>affected</hi> me more.</p>
            <p>Shall I beg the Favour ſome Time of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing "<hi>Manners,</hi>"
the Book you mention to have read.</p>
            <p>I don't remember to have heard you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any Thing about
VOLTAIRE's laſt Play. I therefore ſend it—and thus ends all I have to
ſay upon the Article of Books.</p>
            <p>I am truly glad to hear that you had Mrs. DAVIES ſo long at
<hi>Barrels,</hi> to counterwork the Effects of this unjoyous Seaſon. For my 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1173200201:176"/> own Part, had my Health permitted, I could gladly have
borne a Part there; but I have been little better in bodily Health than I have
been in Mind; and <hi>Home,</hi> when one is not truly well, has more
Attractions than Elyſium. Pardon this unpolite Aſſertion, which ſeems
to partake of Selfiſhneſs: and yet it is <hi>as</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite at leaſt,
to offer one's Company to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when one is not pleaſed with it
one's-ſelf. I deny that Penances can be done at <hi>Barrels.</hi> At the
<hi>Leaſowes,</hi> I have had many a Winter's Experience they may; and what
adds to their Severity is, that they are no way meritorious.</p>
            <p>The Jack was ſent to COTTEREL to be copied in Mahogany long ago.
'Tis poſſible, your Servant may find it ready to take Home.</p>
            <p>I was two or three Times in company with Captain SOMERVILLE, when he
went to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-School.</hi> I would ſend my Compliments, and an
Invitation, if there was probability enough of his remembering me, to render it
proper: though his Good-nature alone could induce him to viſit me now, when
there is <pb n="159" facs="tcp:1173200201:177"/> not a Grain of Amuſement to be expected
either from my Place or myſelf.</p>
            <p>I hear now and then of Mr. O—, by Means of my <hi>good
Friend</hi> Mr. H—. They were both going laſt Week to CHARLES WAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KER's
<hi>Villa</hi>; not his Cabbage-Garden <hi>orné,</hi> as Mr. GRAVES
calls his Place at <hi>Claverton,</hi> and for which I rebuke him, for fear the
Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque ſhould ſpread. The laſt I heard of O— was, that he
blamed Mr. H— for not travelling like an Apoſtle, as <hi>he</hi> did,
with one Coat, one Shirt, one Pair of Stockings, one Wig, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have promoted and accompliſhed the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of two new Bells to

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOthing but ill Health could have hindred me from writing to you,
and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the moſt agreeable Favour of your Letter. I have been
confined ever ſince <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> with that odious Diſtemper the
Gout. The very Name of it is abominable. What leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened my Confinement was,
that as ſoon as I was almoſt well, I fell down Stairs, hurt the 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1173200201:179"/> Part, and was again laid up; but you'll ſay, I might
have wrote for all this. Indeed I could not. For one of the malicious Imps of
the old Demon got into the Fore-finger of my right Hand at the ſame Time. I
can ſhew the Mark now—Beſides, my Mother's Health has been ſo bad,
as quite to diſpirit me, and continues to be ſo; elſe I aſſure you, I
ſhould think of ſeeing the <hi>Leaſowes</hi> this Summer. But I can't do
it, as Things are, upon any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, nor ſhould I ever forgive myſelf,
ſhould ſhe die in my Abſence. All theſe Reaſons have likewiſe
hindered my Journey to <hi>London</hi> this Year. Mr. PEARETH too, has been
exceeding ill; ſo that I may look upon this Year, as unfortunate both to
myſelf and Friends. I hope, however, you have not felt the Influence of this
evil Star. That Health and Happineſs may attend you, is the Intereſt of all
that know you; mine I am ſure in particular; and I can add, that I am
thoroughly ſenſible of it.</p>
            <p>I am an Architect at preſent. Since I have been able to hop about,
I have amuſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that Way. I have been altering the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1173200201:180"/> of my Rooms, and have made them more commodious as I
think: but I will not prejudice your Judgment before-hand. I have, like you,
been at ſome Expence this Way. But there are two Imperfections I have to
ſtruggle with at <hi>Whitchurch,</hi> which never appeared at the
<hi>Leaſowes</hi>; an indifferent Situation, and but a ſecond-hand Head for
Architecture. I long to ſee your Improvements, from thoſe I have ſeen
already. Lady LUXBOROUGH has cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated you as a Deſigner very juſtly and
very elegantly.</p>
            <p>I have got the Verſes, and wonder you did not communicate them to
me, for they pleaſe me on two Accounts, yours and Lady LUX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOROUGH's. I dare
ſay it would have given me double Pleaſure, to have received a Letter from
you by the Hand you propoſed. I am much obliged to you for your kind
Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and think myſelf unhappy I was not in <hi>London</hi> on that
Account. Now, though I cannot aſk the Favour with any Propriety, yet, give me
Leave to ſay, how glad I ſhould be to ſee you at <hi>Whitchurch</hi> this
Summer; and whenever I have that Pleaſure, I beg you <pb n="163" facs="tcp:1173200201:181"/>
will let me know before-hand, for fear of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. As for my Part, I
reſolve to wait on you at the <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> as ſoon as ever it is in
my Power to do it.</p>
            <p>I have one Piece of News to tell you, which moſt likely you have
heard by Mr. GRAVES, which is, that my Brother and Mrs. H—S are married.
I think they are very likely to be happy. I had rather have a Relation than a
Friend married, for the laſt is always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely loſt. You have the
Compliments of all this Place. But my own I ſhall always ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the

               <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>APologies between Friends appear ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, that if you
have ſtill the ſame Inclination which you have formerly ſhewn to look
upon me in that Light, you will never again treat me with the Ceremony of a
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Acquaintance; when you write to me, you give me Pleaſure; when you do
not, I love my own Peace two well to fancy you are angry with me, while I am
not conſcious of my deſerving to have you ſo. You ſee I do not regulate
my Correſpondence as poor Lady — did her Viſits; which ſhe never
was to return ſooner than her former ones had been repaid.</p>
            <p>I am not in the leaſt ſurpriſed that you were pleaſed to
return to the venerable Seat of your <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1173200201:183"/> Anceſtors, and
the Abode of your firſt and happieſt Days, and find nothing trivial or
chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh in the Satisfaction you felt, in ſeeing old Faces full of
Gratitude for Obligations long ſince paſt, and by you, perhaps, forgot; or
in recalling ſome little lively Incidents in the earlieſt and innocent
Hours of Youth. As for the Wiſe and Witty of the preſent Age, I know not
what they would ſay, and I do not deſign to hear it; they will ſcarce
viſit my Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and I ſhall not leave it to viſit <hi>them.</hi> I
hope to diſpoſe of my Houſe in <hi>Downing-Street,</hi> which I would not
do, if I ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to paſs ſix Weeks in <hi>London,</hi> for I am fond
of the Situation. But I find myſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt in the Retreat which my dear
Lord's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited Beneficence has made me Miſtreſs of, and fixed my Home
upon the Spot of Earth I would have choſe for myſelf. Every Thing both
within and without the Houſe reminds me of my Obligations to him; and I
cannot turn my Eyes upon any Object, which is not an Object of his Goodneſs
to me. The Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I take in adding either Beauty or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to my
Habitation, is greatly enhanced by the Reflection, that while I am adorning 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1173200201:184"/> it, I at the ſame Time can ſhew my Value for the
Gift, and my Gratitude to the lamented Giver.</p>
            <p>I have a regular, and, I hope, a religious Family. My Woman, though
ſhe has not lived with me quite three Years, had before lived twenty-three
betwixt Lord GRANTHAM's and Lady COWPER's; my Houſe-keeper has been a Servant
as long; the Perſon who takes in my Accounts, pays the Bills, and overlooks
the Men within Doors, has been in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nineteen Years; and the other,
who has lived ten, has the Care of the Stables, and every Thing without. I
riſe at ſeven, but do not go down till nine, when the Bell rings, and my
whole Family meet me at Chapel; after Prayers, we go to Breakfaſt; any Friend
who happens to be there, myſelf, and my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, have ours in the little
Library: the reſt in their reſpective eating Rooms. About ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if the
Weather permits, we go to walk in the Park, or take the Air in the Coach: but
if it be too bad for either, we return to our various Occupations. At three we
dine; ſit perhaps near an Hour afterwards; then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1173200201:185"/> till we meet at eight for Prayers; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we
adjourn again to the Library, where ſomebody reads aloud, unleſs ſome
Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger comes who chuſes Cards, until Half an Hour paſt nine, when we
ſup, and always part before eleven. This to the fine World would ſound a
melancholy monaſtic Life; and I cannot be ſuppoſed to have choſen it
from my Ignorance of the Splendour and Gaiety of a Court, but from a thorough
Experience that they can give no ſolid Happineſs; and I find myſelf more
calmly pleaſed in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Way of Living, and more truly contented, than
I ever was in the Bloom and Pomp of my Youth. I am no longer dubious what Point
to purſue. There is but one proper for the Decline of Life, and indeed the
only one worth the Anxiety of a rational Creature at any Age: but how do the
Fire of Youth and Flattery of the World, blind our Eyes, and miſlead our
Fancies, after a Thouſand imaginary Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which are ſure to
diſappoint us in the End!</p>
            <p>I condole with you for the Loſs of Mr. PRICE, as a faithful
Servant is always a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1173200201:186"/>Mr. SHENSTONE does me a great deal of Honour
in inſcribing his Ode upon <hi>Rural Elegance</hi> to me. I am perſuaded he
is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Subject, for I have heard from People who ſaw his Gardens
not long ago, that they are the moſt perfect Model of it.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay, Lady NORTHUMBERLAND did not know how near ſhe was to
you, or ſhe would not have paſſed by, without enquiring after you. The
News-papers will inform you, that her Lord ſupplies the Place of Lord
WALDGRAVE, in the King's Bed-Chamber. Their Children, I mean the two
youngeſt, were both here, while they made their <hi>Warwick</hi> and
<hi>Staffordſhire</hi> Tour, and alſo till they came from <hi>Bath.</hi>
The little Boy is called ALGER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOON, after his Grand-Papa; and is, though

            <p>AFTER a long Seaſon of Vanity and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Diſſipation, I
return with <hi>unfeigned</hi> Pleaſure to a Correſpondence with my
deareſt and moſt familiar Friends. So juſt is your Notion of the
Permanency of my Affection; and ſo true it is, that much greater
<hi>Civilities,</hi> than any <hi>yet</hi> ſhewn me by the Great, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
alter my Opinion of the Valuableneſs of your Friendſhip. Will you believe
my ſimple Aſſertion, or ſhall I take Pains to prove it by the very
Nature of Things? I cannot eſteem it neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Your Accounts of Mrs. WALKER's Death was new to me. I will write to
Mr. WHISTLER ſhortly, and am in Hopes, I ſhall <hi>now</hi> prevail with
him to give me ſome Weeks of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Amongſt the Strangers who
viſited my Walks this Summer, there were three or more, as their Servants
informed us, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <pb n="171" facs="tcp:1173200201:189"/> to theſe
Amuſements, on the Death of their Relations. Perhaps the Sight of an old
Friend is no leſs ſerviceable on ſuch Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Your Stream, I find, is very conſiderable; I dare ſay HORACE's
was not larger, though mentioned as 
<q rend="inline">"<note n="*" place="bottom">Fit to be called a River;

<hi>Notice</hi> taken of it, for I aſſure you I have heard it commended
here this Summer: I forget by whom. You ſhew exceſſive Delicacy in your
Diſlike of its running over Water-Creſſes as Pot-Herbs. Pray what can at
once have more Beauty and more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, ſuppoſing your Stream to paſs
through the Kitchen-Garden? But I will not quarrel with you about the
<hi>Kind</hi> of Aquatick, if you will allow me to think nothing more
pleaſing than <hi>Greens beneath tranſparent Water.</hi>

ſend you more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Ode to Sir RICH. LYTTELTON, but that it would be

               <salute>Dear Mr. H—N,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS can prove no other than an heavy, ſtupid Letter, agreeable to
the preſent Diſpoſition of my Mind. The moſt it can pretend, is to
acquaint you, in vulgar Terms, that you retain your uſual Place in my
Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Eſteem; yet this may be no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Information, now you have
accepted a Place at Court, and have left your Friends at Liberty to form
Conjectures about your future Conduct; to continue, or to diſmiſs you, as
our Electors do their Repreſentatives. Be this as it will, I confeſs that I
rechuſe you, and wiſh that every Court in <hi>Europe</hi> conſiſted of
as honeſt Men.</p>
            <p>You are in the right to decline taking M—s, if you find the
Scheme too expenſive; and as <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1173200201:193"/> he could not have come
into your Service, without purchaſing his Time out from his Maſter, I
believe it will now be his Point to continue with him till the Expiration of
his Indentures.</p>
            <p>I am now in ſome Sort of Doubt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Management of my
Snuff-Box; whether to have it repaired in the cheapeſt Way, with a figured
Tortoiſe-Shell on the Top, and a plain Tortoiſe-Shell in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; or to
exchange the Gold of it, and have a figured Tortoiſe-Shell Box with a gold
Rim, <hi>like yours with a gilt one,</hi> only in the Shape of an oblong
Square, a little rounded at the Corners. I ſhould have no Thoughts of this,
but that my own ſeems too little and unmanly. Give me your Opinion ſoon;
though, if this latter Scheme includes much Expence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with the former,
if you pleaſe, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
            <p>I deſire my gold Claſp and Rim may be directly exchanged; I
ſhall have a new gold Claſp and Rim: perhaps, may encloſe a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for
the former, before I ſeal this Letter. <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1173200201:194"/>
               <hi>Quaere,</hi> therefore, whether the Man, who makes it, will now allow
moſt in the Exchange.</p>
            <p>I believe I ſhall defer the Purchaſe of my favourite Waiſtcoat
till the Spring. My Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitants begin to fail me, (though Sir GEORGE
LYTTELTON, the Dean, and Mr. LYTTELTON, were here yeſterday) my Verdure
abandons me, and I have little elſe to do, than go to ſleep for the
Winter.</p>
            <p>Pray ſend me the Verſes on Miſs B—R, by the honourable
Perſonage. As to mine, you may give Copies, if you pleaſe; but as they are
not fully corrected, I hope whoever has thoſe Copies, will take care they be
not printed. I can ſay nothing polite at preſent, ſo muſt defer my
Acknowledgments to the Ladies at <hi>Woolſton,</hi> till I write to you
again.</p>
            <p>Your Letter to Lady LUXBOROUGH was promiſed, ſo I think you
ſhould by all Means write, though I confeſs it appears to have been rather
too long deferred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:1173200201:195"/>And now having ſpoke to the principal Parts
of your Letter, let me conſider what I have to add.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, your Tenant, old Mr. P—s, of the Hill-Top, was
carried in a Hearſe, through my Grounds, to be buried yeſterday. Mr.
I— has been two or three Days in this Country adjuſting Matters with
your Tenants. —.</p>
            <p>C—Y tells me, you may have your Place ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied at the
Expence of five Pounds <hi>per</hi> Year. If ſo, is it not your Point to come
down and live at <hi>Lappal?</hi> I do not herein ſpeak merely for my own
Sake. Sir GEORGE told me yeſterday, that he had ſecured me BLOOMER'S
Cottage. I ſaid, I was obliged to him, but did not aſk, after what Manner.
He promiſed to come and dine, and ſtay a Night with me next Year. In the
mean Time, I am beguiled of his dining with me, by <hi>your</hi> venerable
D—; for having had an Offer from him, from Mr. <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1173200201:196"/>
LYTTELTON and the Dean, to take a Dinner here this Week, the D—, through
his great Addreſs, conveyed all theſe Honours to the <hi>Grange</hi>; and
to-morrow, it ſeems, Sir GEORGE dines with Maſter PEARSALL. I
remonſtrated upon this to Mr. LYTTELTON, at the <hi>Grange,</hi> in a Manner
pretty forcible, and yet tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly decent. He excuſed for himſelf and them
in a Manner that made me quite ſatisfied with <hi>him.</hi> He is an
excellent young Man.</p>
            <p>Let theſe Things ſerve as Leſſons to you, who are a

            <p>I FIND myſelf at length enabled to obey your Grace's Commands,
after a Delay, but ill expreſſive of the Pleaſure with which I received
them. But by ſome Means or other, the Original of this Ode was miſlaid, and
it was not immediately in my Power, from ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Materials, to give it
once more the Form, in which it now appears.</p>
            <p>I fear it is no leſs requiſite to make an Apology for the
Freedom of inſcribing it to your Grace from the Beginning. In this
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I have but little to offer, beſide the flattering Imagination,
that the <hi>Subject</hi> might recommend it. It would be no ſmall Vanity in
me to preſume, that in Regard to the more elegant Amuſements of a Country
Life, I had <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1173200201:198"/> the Honour to entertain the ſame
Sentiments with your Grace; however, ſomething of this Kind I muſt of
Neceſſity confeſs, if I would give a genuine Account of the Liberty I
have taken.</p>
            <p>The additional Fragment was originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as an Epiſode to
a much larger Poem on the Subject. It was thrown into its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Form
ſoon after the Rebellion, and it is now tranſcribed, becauſe I would not
ſend a vacant Space in my Paper, wherein I had the moſt diſtant Chance of
contributing to your Grace's Amuſement.</p>
            <p>Lady LUXBOROUGH, who does me the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of communicating theſe
trifling Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to your Grace, will not fail to do me the
<hi>Juſtice</hi> of declaring the ſingular Veneration I have for your
Grace's Character. She will teſtify, with how much Diffidence I offer you
ſuch imperfect Compoſitions, written at a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from every judicious
Friend, with too much Inaccuracy, by the Side of Meadows and Streams, from
which little can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but a Group of rural Alluſions. Above

ſhe never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed your two excellent Poems to my Hand till laſt
<hi>Saturday</hi> Night, you muſt look upon <pb n="182" facs="tcp:1173200201:200"/> me as the
moſt ungrateful and taſteleſs of all Mortals. I have read them both over
more than once with Pleaſure: but will it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſtrange, if I
confeſs to you, that the Honour you have done me by the Inſcription of the
Firſt, and a Stanza or two in the Poem itſelf, has given me ſome Pain?
And I ſhall look upon it as a very great Addition to the Favour, if whenever
my Name, or that of <hi>Piercy-Lodge</hi> occurs, you will have the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to fill the Blank (which leaving out thoſe Words muſt occaſion) with
Stars, Daſhes, or any other Mark you pleaſe, without ſuſpecting me of
an affected or falſe Modeſty, ſince to either of theſe Accuſations I
can honeſtly plead not guilty. The Idea you have formed of my Character, you
have taken from a partial Friend, whoſe Good-nature may have (and in this
Caſe certainly has) warped her Judgment. The World in general, ſince they
can find no Fault in your Poem, will blame the Choice of the Perſon to whom
it is inſcribed, and draw mortifying Compariſons betwixt the ideal Lady and
the real one. But I have a more impartial Judge to produce, than either my
Friend or the World, and that is my own <pb n="183" facs="tcp:1173200201:201"/> Heart, which
though it may flatter me, I am not quite ſo faulty as the latter would
repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me, at the ſame Time loudly admoniſhes me, that I am ſtill
further from the valuable Perſon Lady LUXBOROUGH has drawn you in to
ſuppoſe me.</p>
            <p>I hope you will accept theſe Reaſons as the genuine, and moſt

            <p>I DID indeed, dear Madam, begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of having the Honour,
and (what I felt more ſenſibly) the Pleaſure of hearing from you again. I
am ſo ſubject to fall into Errors, that I was afraid ſome unguarded
Expreſſion in my laſt Letter might have given you Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and yet my
Heart bore witneſs, how far I had been from intending it.</p>
            <p>I have been extremely ill the whole Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and for ſome Weeks
believed in great Danger; but, by the Bleſſing of God upon Dr. SHAW's
Preſcriptions, I am at preſent, though lean and ill-favoured, much better;
yet ſtill obliged to be carried up and down Stairs, for Want of Strength and
Breath to carry my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but I have great Reaſon to bleſs God 
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1173200201:203"/> for the Eaſe I now enjoy. When one comes to the laſt
broken Arches of MIRZA's Bridge, Reſt from Pain muſt bound our Ambition,
for Pleaſure is not to be expected in this World; where I have no more a
Notion of laying Schemes to be executed ſix Months, than I have ſix Years
hence; which, I believe, helps to keep my Spirits in an even State of
Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to enjoy the Satisfactions which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves,
without anxious Solicitude about their Duration. We have lived to an Age that
neceſſarily ſhews us the Earth crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling under our Feet, and as our
Journey ſeems approaching towards the Verge of Life, is it not more natural
to caſt our Eyes to the Proſpect beyond it, than by a retroſpective View,
to recall the troubleſome Trifles that ever made our Road difficult or
dangerous? Methinks it would be imitating LOT's Wife, (whoſe Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is
not recorded as an Example for us to follow) to want to look back to the
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Scene we are ſo near eſcaping <hi>from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſpent the laſt three Weeks moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. The firſt
of them, the Biſhop of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and Mr. TALBOT, paſſed with us,
and <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1173200201:204"/> had the Goodneſs to leave Miſs TALBOT (whoſe
Character I think you muſt have heard) when they went away. She is
<hi>all</hi> the World has ſaid of her, as to an uncommon Share of
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: but ſhe has other Charms, which I imagine you will join
with me in giving the Preference even to that; a mild and equal Temper, an
unaffected pious Heart, and the moſt univerſal Good-will to her
Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that I ever knew. She cenſures Nobody, ſhe deſpiſes
Nobody, and whilſt her own Life is a Pattern of Goodneſs, ſhe does not
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim with Bitterneſs againſt Vice. We ſpent a good deal of our Time
in our own Rooms, except in the Mornings, but our Time is a good deal broken in
upon. Soon after nine we meet in the Chapel; as ſoon as Prayers are over, we
go to Breakfaſt, and after that we work, during which, Mr. COWSLAD, or my
Chaplain, read aloud; at eleven we go, if the Weather is tolerable, to take the
Air for two Hours at leaſt, which Dr. SHAW inſiſts upon my doing. The
Moment we get out of the Coach, we ſee no more of one another till three,
when the Dinner is punctually upon the Table. Dinner and Tea are both over 
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1173200201:205"/> by five, when we retire till eight, and then go to
Prayers; after which we adjourn into the little Library, where we work, and the
Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen read, as in the Morning, till Supper, a Quarter before ten, and it
is a Rule to be all in our Rooms a Quarter before eleven.</p>
            <p>We are at preſent very highly entertained with the <hi>Hiſtory
of Sir Charles Grandiſon,</hi> which is ſo vaſtly above <hi>Pamela</hi>
or <hi>Clariſſa,</hi> that I ſhall not be eaſy till you have read it,
and ſent me your Sentiments upon it. Miſs TAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOT received Lady GRAY's
[<hi>Somewhat omitted, perhaps ſome Remarks on Grandiſon</hi>] in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ſix Sides, wrote with the greateſt good Senſe and Vivacity imaginable.
I fancy ſhe is an excellent and agreeable young Woman.</p>
            <p>It is now more than Time to return you Thanks for the Trouble you
have taken in conveying Mr. SHENSTONE's admirable Poem<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rural Elegance,</hi> inſcribed to the Writer of this
Letter.</note> to me. I have wrote to him this Poſt, and could not do it
ſooner, becauſe his Letter was only dated <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> and I could
not find out his Poſt-Town, without ſending to Mrs. STANLEY, whom I do not
viſit, and who <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1173200201:206"/> lives twelve Miles from me. I have
expreſſed my Gratitude in the beſt Manner I am able; but am under the
Necſſity of declining the Honour he intended me, and have begged him to
fill up the Blanks with Stars, or what he pleaſes, whenever my Name, or that
of <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Lodge</hi> was deſigned, and I hope he will oblige me.</p>
            <p>You ſay, you have been in a Lethargy. Dear Madam, this muſt have
proceeded from ſome Oppreſſion upon your Spirits, for which I have known
Tar-Water to be a ſovereign Remedy, and wiſh you would try it. Poor Mrs.
W—D! but ſince we can ſay nothing to her Honour, let us not expatiate
upon her Diſgrace.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. IAGO,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM at a Loſs how to begin this Letter. I will not, however, in
the uſual Way, give you a tedious Liſt of Apologies in the Front of it.
Some Account of my Silence you will find diſperſed throughout the Letter,
and as for what is deficient, I will depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>There has not been a Perſon here ſince you left me, of whom I
could obtain the leaſt Intelligence concerning you; and as an Enquiry by the
Poſt was my only obvious Method, and as I both owed and promiſed you a
Letter at Parting, I do acknowledge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to blame, notwithſtanding all
the Excuſes I can make.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:1173200201:208"/>Amidſt all that Conflux of Viſitants whom
I received this laſt Seaſon, I was hardly once <hi>ſo</hi> happy as I was
in <hi>your</hi> Company: I was the happier in ſeeing you ſo, and if you
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I took Notice at the Time, how little your Vivacity was impaired, in
compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of mine. If I was then but a ſorry Companion, it was not
Solitude and Winter that could make me a better <hi>Correſpondent.</hi> That
Gaiety and Humour, which you was once ſo partial as to diſcover in my
Letters, will hardly appear again there, even to the Eyes of my moſt partial
Friend; at leaſt, they will not enliven any Letter that I write in Winter.
Yet Friendſhip ſtill remains; Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, like the Root of ſome
perennial Flower, perhaps even then gathers Strength in Secret, that it may
produce a better Diſplay of its Colours in the Spring.</p>
            <p>This I do not pretend to be an adequate Apology. I know, my
deareſt Friend, that you both like to ſee and to hear from me at all Times;
but it proves that you have no <hi>great</hi> Loſs, either of my Letters or
my Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1173200201:209"/>I am, as the Phraſe is, deeply penetrated by
the Civility of your Neighbour, Mr. MIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER. He took a ſhort Dinner with me
once, dropping Sir GEORGE at Mr. PEARSALL's; he could not have pleaſed me
better: he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards breakfaſted here, and in general ſeemed fond of
every Opportunity of bringing good Company to my Hole, the <hi>Leaſowes.</hi>
Do you think that <hi>Radway</hi> or that <hi>Harbury</hi> have no Attractions
for me? You know me too well to imagine it—But I truly am not well enough
to dare to be from Home. Friends will ſay, 
<q rend="inline">"You may be as free at my Houſe as at your
own,"</q> and they will mean what they ſay. But what is this to the
Purpoſe, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make yourſelf ſo?</p>
            <p>I cannot pretend to give you a Detail of what paſſed ſince I
ſaw you. Lord D— with myſelf made one Viſit to <hi>Hewell.</hi> I
will not ſay, that his Lordſhip only, for I alſo was received in the
politeſt Manner imaginable. We met Mr. and Mrs. WINNINGTON. We took a Trip to
Mr. VERNON's, where we met alſo Mr. COVENTRY, and a deal of other 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1173200201:210"/> Company. All this would afford Subject for
Converſation betwixt you and me, but I muſt not uſe ſo much of my Paper
to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Lord P—'s Piece of Water ſhould have been only a large
Serpentine Stream. I can give you many Reaſons. I think him ſuch a Sort of
Character, as may <hi>ſhine</hi> in Company upon growing older; he is, and
muſt be beloved already: he has been here once ſince, and talks of
cauſing me to come and deſign for him in his Park. The Plan for the Houſe
is right, ſuppoſing it right to continue it. His Park may have many
Beauties. I hope ſome time to meet <hi>you</hi> there.</p>
            <p>My Ode after long Delay has been ſent to the Ducheſs of
SOMERSET. It has produced me two genteel Letters from her Grace, and I am
pleaſed with the Event, for ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I could mention.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, DODSLEY aſked me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to a fourth
Volume of his Miſcellanies. I meant at firſt to do ſo pretty largely; but
I <pb n="193" facs="tcp:1173200201:211"/> afterwards changed my Mind, and determined to ſend
only little Pieces. I did ſend him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of my own, ſome of my Friends
WHIST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER, and GRAVES, and ſome accidental Pieces of yours, which lay in my
Drawer. I meant to ſend ſomething of yours of my own Accord, if I was
hurried, otherwiſe not without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying for Conſent. He wrote me word,
laſt Week, that his Publication muſt be deferred, upon Account of the
Elections, ſo that we ſhall now have Time enough to meet or write upon the
Subject. What I purpoſed was your <hi>Linnets,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"I owe, &amp;c."</q> Dick G—s ſent me the
incloſed little comical Fable; I made ſome few Alterations, and put it into
DODSLEY's Hands. Be ſo good as to return it, as I have now no other Copy.</p>
            <p>Some Correſpondence I have had this Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Mr. H—N,
about Toys and Trinkets, which he gets done for me in <hi>London.</hi> He is by
far a better Friend and Correſpondent than a Poet. Should you take a Trip to
Town, he would be quite <hi>proud</hi> to ſee you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:1173200201:212"/>I am like the reſt of the World, peruſing
<hi>Sir Charles Grandiſon.</hi> I don't know whether that World joins me in
preferring the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's <hi>Clariſſa.</hi> He wants the Art of Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in every Thing he has yet wrote.</p>
            <p>My dear Friend, pardon this flegmatic Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and cheriſh and
preſerve your own Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. If Occaſion offers, do not neglect to call

            </opener>
            <p>I WOULD ſooner have returned you my Thanks for the Favour of your
moſt truly obliging Letter, but was afraid of being too troubleſome, by
engaging ſo much of your Time, which you know ſo well how to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to
better Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The kind Offer you made me, of ſending me any Thing you
occaſionally happened to write, I look upon as the higheſt Obligation; and
you will greatly add to it, if you will permit me to ſhew them to a very
ingenious Friend of mine, whoſe Ingenuity is her leaſt Praiſe, ſince
the even Chearfulneſs of her Temper, the Candour and Integrity of her Heart,
joined with the moſt unaffected and honourable Piety, muſt claim the
Eſteem of all <pb n="196" facs="tcp:1173200201:214"/> Lovers of Virtue, who have the
Happineſs of being acquainted with her. You may poſſibly have heard of
her, as in her very young Days, ſome little Things of her writing got abroad,
which were thought worthy of Notice, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Age ſhe was then of.
She is a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter of old Biſhop TALBOT's and Niece to the Lord
Chancellor of that Name. She has lately ſpent ſix Weeks with me here, and
went away only laſt <hi>Thurſday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take the Liberty to ſend this Letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cover, as I am
conſcious that nothing I write is worth double Poſtage, ſince its only
Meaning is to expreſs the Regard with which I am,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FEW People can boaſt a greater Senſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Obligations
conferred upon them than myſelf, and few are, I believe, leſs able to repay
them: but that I may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear quite defective in both, I will endeavour to
ſend you a long, though not a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Epiſtle, in return for the many
obliging ones you have favoured me with.</p>
            <p>My Spirits, like yours, have a Tendency towards Retirement, and
whatever brings them into violent Action, is ſure to deſtroy them. No
leſs than ten or twelve Perſons in different Parts of the Town, who are
lately arrived from the Country, have I been obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to one Place or
another, which, with my own Affairs likewiſe, have often made we wiſh to
dwell where no one ſhould find me out for <pb n="198" facs="tcp:1173200201:216"/> ſeven
Years to come. Mr. B—H was one of my Viſitors, and brought great
Complaints from SAPPHO, and the Ladies at <hi>W—n,</hi> againſt me, for
not writing according to Promiſe; I have wrote her a very penitential Letter
of two Sheets, which I hope will make an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and produce an Anſwer.
Thus far have I wrote a Week ago, and by many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences have been prevented
finiſhing my Letter till this Day, when I received yours of the twelfth
Current, to which, as well as your former Epiſtles, I will ſcrawl forth
ſome Things by Way of Anſwer.</p>
            <p>I have at laſt got (after having two returned) a gold Pencil
Caſe made to my Mind for you, which with the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Pebble, and
ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of my Seals, I packed up in a Box, and carried them
myſelf to the <hi>White-Horſe,</hi> in <hi>Friday-Street,</hi> laſt
<hi>Tueſday,</hi> in Order to go by ROWLEY's Waggon, but he was gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I arrived there; which induced me to leave the Box (packed up in blue Paper,
and ſealed with my Arms) in the Hands of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Houſe, who
promiſed herſelf to deliver it to-day to old DANKS, and hope you 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1173200201:217"/> will receive it ſafe ſome-time next Week. The Pebble
I was obliged to return, for I did not think it was made concave and convex
enough; it is not quite as I would have it, however, it is as well as I can
procure it, and if it pleaſes you, it will pleaſe me of courſe. I ſaw a
beautiful Onyx at the Lapidary's, eight Inches long or more, and four broad, it
was to be cut for an Etwee. I have bought a Sheet of China Paper, pink Colour,
bigger than this, for one Shilling and Six-pence, and ſome few Prints, a new
Pair of fine ſilver Buckles, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If I could be aſtoniſhed at any Thing, it would be at the
Perplexity and Delay of the Law; and to compleat my Amazement, my Attorney has
preſented me with a Bill of Coſts of more than two hundred Pounds.
Poſitively I will leave <hi>London.</hi> My Scheme is this; to board at
<hi>L—,</hi> and ſee no Company, except yourſelf and Lord DUDLEY's
Family, on any Account whatever. Do ſtand my Friend, and adviſe me what do
in regard to ſettling there. I propoſe to ſend down my Cabinet, and
ſome other Boxes, very ſoon. If you will be ſo good <pb n="200" facs="tcp:1173200201:218"/> to make JOHN TAYLOR and SAMUEL PARKES ſet their merry Men to work
for me. I will prepare to depart from <hi>London</hi> the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of next
Month; muſt call for a few Days at <hi>Gore-Lands,</hi> as being the firſt
viſiting Place in my Rout; next, <hi>Oxford</hi> will detain me a little
while; from thence to <hi>Edge-Hills,</hi> (to ſee Mr. T—N, who I hear
has got a Living of three hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> lately fell to
him;) next to <hi>Coventry,</hi> where I muſt ſtay a Fortnight, or perhaps
a Month, then to <hi>Birmingham,</hi> and then to the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of
my Tours till next Summer, of which I can ſay nothing certain; however, I
will live <hi>in Spe melioris Aevi,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In Hope of
better Times.</note> and, with ſometimes your Company, I ſhall eſteem
myſelf happier than if I remained here. Pardon me, when I confeſs, I fear
you will think me altered in many Reſpects; that I am no very elegible
Companion is moſt certain: what with the Intricacy of my Affairs, indifferent
Health, (for my Pain in my Breaſt has troubled me much of late) and ſome
other Incidents, I am rendered ſo ſtupid and confuſed, that I ſcarce
can rank myſelf a Degree above the <pb n="201" facs="tcp:1173200201:219"/> verieſt Boor in
the Country; and when I come down, I ſhall put a quick Stop to all the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Viſits from all the <hi>Jack-a-Nokes</hi>'s and
<hi>Tom-a-Stiles</hi> of <hi>Hales-Owen,</hi> even though that double-faced
<hi>Janus</hi> you mention were at the Head of them, peeping in at both Doors
at once. I abſolutely have laughed very heartily this Afternoon, at your odd
Account of the old Cur, whom I ſhould take great Pleaſure to mortify, or
even to mar, for he can never be mended before the D—l has him.</p>
            <p>I fear your Anger againſt me is at this Hour, (paſt eight at
Night) at a Criſis; another very peſtilent Fit will ariſe, worſe than
the former on <hi>Monday,</hi> which I prognoſticate will go off at the
ſame Time, the very Inſtant you read this Part in my Letter. Am not I
<hi>very</hi> vain, to think you can ſo <hi>very</hi> eaſily forgive me; I
fear you will have more Reaſon to find Fault with me in the Country, when I
ſhall be ſo much nearer to you then than I am now. I do not fiſh for a
Compliment, when I ſay, I have many dark Spots for a few white ones: but I
flatter myſelf, you will have the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to bear with my Foibles, more
than any <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1173200201:220"/> body elſe. Be not angry at me for not
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing this to Lord D—Y. I write ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there, and ſo
ſeldom have anſwers, that I fear his Lordſhip will think I make too free
with him: I deſired a few Franks a while ago, but have heard nothing
concerning them; however, do make my reſpectful Compliments at the
<hi>Grange,</hi> when you go there. I hear that Miſs DOLMAN and Miſs
MILLWARD are in <hi>London</hi>; the former I have not ſeen, and the latter I
am unacquainted with.</p>
            <p>I lately contracted ſome Acquaintance with a Gentleman who is a
great Virtuoſo, he is a F. R. S. and has a very fine Collection both of
Medals and Foſſils, eſpecially the latter, which he is willing to
increaſe, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the former. I told him of the <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
Lime-Pitts; he ſhewed me ſome Foſſils, like thoſe you gave me from
thence; begs me to procure him all I could lay my Hands upon, and he would
exchange Medals for them. I ſhould be obliged to you, if you meet with any
more, to reſerve them till I come down, and in the next to inform me, if you
are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to procure any for me, as I have promiſed <pb n="203" facs="tcp:1173200201:221"/>
the Gentleman to viſit him again ſoon: you muſt not let the
<hi>D—y</hi> Fellow impoſe upon you, he is ignorant, though impudent.
The Gentleman's Name is B—E, of <hi>Swediſh</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: I bought
ſome ſilver Coins of him very cheap. I ſaw the famous Mr. A. POND at his
Houſe in the City, who had a Diamond on his Finger, which I think outſhone
the D— of E—'s, who I find is, as a F. R. S. an Acquaintance of
theirs. The D—n is gone to <hi>E—r.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What to ſay concerning Miſs — I know not! All has been
done, and ſaid, and thought of, by all of us that could be. I pity her for
her Mother's, as well as for her own Sake, and ſhould be ſorry to have her
Mother think her incapable of going into the World; I do aſſure you, (under
the Veil of Secrecy) ſhe is too giddy, young and thoughtleſs, as well as
proud, to know her own Intereſt, or even, knowing it, to purſue it. A young
Lady will not bear with her; and it would be ſomewhat difficult to introduce
her to one of middle Age, who would ſtrictly keep her under her Eye, and
improve her by Advice and Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="204" facs="tcp:1173200201:222"/> more than
Command; for ſhe has at School a great deal of Work to very little Book,
which I am certain makes her, at her leiſure Hours, fly to Amuſement rather
than Study. Do not mention this to Mrs. R. I will talk to Mrs. B—
concerning her.</p>

Pleaſures! I will ſay no more of this Matter to you, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every

            <p>I ſaw Mr. CRAWLEY to-day, who enquired after your Health, &amp;c.
deſiring his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <pb n="206" facs="tcp:1173200201:224"/> to you. I am by him
informed, that Miſs L— is one of Mr. W—'s Executors, and will
inherit great Part of his Fortune; tho' the Will has a Caveat lodged againſt
it, which may probably cauſe ſome Trouble before ſhe can enjoy what I
hope will render her inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the World. Pray do you know whether Lord
D— is coming to Town or not? I hear he is.</p>
            <p>My Cabinet and Boxes did not go laſt <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> it
ſeems, but will next—When I ſhall follow them I know not; my Attorney
tells me, I muſt ſtay in Town till my Cauſe comes on, and is over. I have
taken another Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, but ſhall not go to it till the Middle of next Month;
and even then would have you direct your Letters here as uſual. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhall like another Lodging ſo well as I do this.</p>
            <p>My Brother, who is my principal Witneſs, is to come up; in
ſhort, I have little Time of Relaxation, either to Body or Mind, and wiſh I
were once ſettled in the Country. Your kind Invitation to the
<hi>Leaſowes</hi> obliges me much, <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1173200201:225"/> but do not preſs
me to ſee Company, whilſt I am ſo much happier <hi>there</hi> without. By

            <p>Sir G— L— is to be Treaſurer of the Navy, as reported.
People tell me, I ſhould make an Intereſt for myſelf in his Favour. How

D—'s Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before. However, all her Relations will think
themſelves laſtingly indebted both to him and to all beſide who have
contributed their kind Endeavours to further her Recovery. We are under a
terrible Anxiety concerning her. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied as I am of the Abilities and
Vigilance of Dr. B—, and convinced of the friendly Care of her
Acquaintance that attend her, I ſhall dread to look into the Letter that I
expect by to-morrow's Poſt. God grant it may be favourable! I have Hopes
given me to-night; Mr. D— ſends me Word, that the Letter he received on
<hi>Thurſday</hi> (probably writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after yours) acquainted him, that the
Puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules began to turn; that ſhe was then better, and that they hoped the

            <p>I Really compaſſionate your Sufferings, both of Body as well as
Mind, the former (the Tooth-ach I mean) may perhaps ſoon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, the
latter, I fear, muſt be effected by Time, But it is needleſs, as well as
imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, in me to moralize to you upon this, or any other unavoidable
Misfortune, who know how to reconcile the ſeeming Contradictions in the
Decrees of Providence, and to ſubmit to them in a better Manner than People
of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Judgments than yourſelf can. Let me have the Pleaſure, my dear
Friend, to find your Spirits unbroken by this Shock, and endeavour to ſhake
off the Melancholy you are too ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to indulge, to the Prejudice of your
Health, when Accidents like this, or ſometimes leſs, befal you. I have not
ſeen Mr. C—, (nor can I till <hi>Thurſday)</hi> therefore do not
pretend to ſend <pb n="211" facs="tcp:1173200201:229"/> you any more Particulars, relating to
the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome News you have received. I beg, if you would have me think you
well, to let me hear from you immediately.</p>
            <p>I am extremely pleaſed with your Argument upon Enmity and Revenge;
it is my own Way of thinking, yet I often lament, that I am compelled to act
contrary to it, in the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of my Law-Suit againſt —, the
faithleſs Guardian of my younger Days and ſhattered Fortune. <hi>If any Man
will take my Coat, I muſt give him my Cloak alſo.</hi> This is very
ſelf-denying Doctrine, and what I ſcarce think was intended to be literally
accepted. I have been theſe three Days paſt attending on my Attorney, about
ſettling ſome diſagreeable Truths relating to my Cauſe; and greatly
wronged as I am, I would forgive the Author of my Evils, if he would reſtore
what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly detains from me, and baniſh himſelf from my Knowledge,
without calling him to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for what his Extravagancy has hitherto robbed
me of; this I fear he will not do, and Self-preſervation will compel me to
take all Advantages I can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:1173200201:230"/>I am greatly concerned to think, I ſhall not

already have had, and ſtill offer to undertake to ſerve me.</p>
            <p>As I am in great Expectations my Cauſe will be determined this

            <p>I Should not have let two Poſts ſlip away ſince I received
your laſt Letter, dated the 6th Inſtant, could I have avoided ſuch an
Omiſſion; I will give my Reaſons for ſo doing before I end my
Letter.</p>
            <p>When I reflect upon the melancholy Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind you labour
under, I think I ſhould not indulge it. It is offering an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable
Sacrifice to an irremediable Misfortune. I can ſympathize with my Friend, and
partake of his Grief, yet it is not, I believe, any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of a
compaſſionate Temper, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to remove thoſe Ideas from the Mind
(if they impair the Health of the Sufferer) which are too violent for it; even
though the Object were (if poſſible) more meritorious than the
greatly-lamented Lady who was ſo <pb n="214" facs="tcp:1173200201:232"/> ſuddenly hurried
from us: however, while this Cataſtrophe is ſo recent, I may venture to
write upon a Subject which I hope Time will draw the Veil over, though not
totally efface; you expect it from me; yet I know few Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that have
not very probably reached your Ears by other Hands. I purpoſely avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
going to Mr. C—'s, by Reaſon of the great Confuſion they were in,
till the Middle of this Week, when I called, and paid the Thanks you deſired,
both to that Family and Dr. B—, for their Care and Attendance. Mrs.
C—'s little Girl was ſent out of the Way, and is not permitted to come
Home yet; ſhe has been ſo ill herſelf, that it was feared ſhe would
have miſcarried, but is now better. Miſs M—D came into the Room while
I was there, and aſked much after you and Mr. D—, whom ſhe was glad
to hear was gone to D—'s. She deſired me to remember her Compliments
when I wrote to you, and ſhould be glad to hear how you were in Health. I
thought ſhe looked a little Wild, and was fearful of mentioning any Thing
that might diſorder her again; they tell me, ſhe is, in a Manner, quite
well, for when ſhe was at the worſt, <hi>Ophelia</hi> in <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> 
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:1173200201:233"/> Mrs. B— ſaid, could not equal her Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</p>
            <p>Mrs. B— could ſcarcely refrain her Tears when ſhe ſpoke
upon the Subject, and it gave me great Pain to hear her Detail. She told me,
the Doctor left her at half an Hour paſt ten as well as could be expected. At
three in the Morning, the Nurſe went down Stairs; Miſs M— dropt
aſleep, when Miſs S— perceived the poor Lady ſtruggling to ſpit,
and though every Aſſiſtance was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately at Hand, ſhe expired in
leſs than five Minutes. The Doctor returned, Mrs. B— ſaid, ſo
affected, that he did not recover his Spirits for two or three Days afterwards,
and wiſhed often, that he had never known her, though every body is well
ſatisfied with what he did; Miſs M—, in particular, ſpoke in
Raptures upon the Tenderneſs of Conduct, and friendly Affability that
appeared through his whole At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.</p>
            <p>I will here put an End to my Narration. I fear I have ſaid too
much, and am almoſt inclined not to ſend what I have wrote. My 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1173200201:234"/> Motives for not writing ſooner appear on the other
Side; only a diſagreeable Hurry you will find.</p>
            <p>You may, perhaps, remember me to have mentioned a Relation I had in
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> of my Name, who always was ſeemingly fond of me, and having
no Children, promiſed to make me his Heir. I was ſent for by a Gentleman, a
few days ago, who informed me, he was dead and buried; that his Will was proved
in the Country, the Contents of which he knew nothing of; but that the
Executors have ſold off all his Effects. I wrote laſt <hi>Tueſday</hi> to
an Attorney near there, to whom I gave Orders to ſeek out the Executors, and
ſend me a Copy of the Will. My Time has been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what employed in
ſeeking what Intelligence I could amongſt his Acquaintance here, who none
of them had heard of his Death. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any great Reaſon to expect any
Thing from this Gentleman; and I think it an Abuſe upon a Perſon's
Credulity, to amuſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one with unmeaning Promiſes and falſe
Hopes. If I am diſappointed, I will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to grieve me one Moment,
but forget <pb n="217" facs="tcp:1173200201:235"/> it as ſoon as poſſible; to which
Purpoſe, I will (if Mr. I— can ſpare me) come down to the
<hi>Leaſowes</hi> for a Week or two, as my Cauſe will not come on theſe
two Months, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>I do not find that Mr. COVENTRY and Mr. PYTTS are likely to have an
Oppoſition in <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire,</hi> therefore my Appearance will not
ſerve them much, but only will prove an unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Expence to myſelf.
I have been impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned, by many well-wiſhers to me, to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate Sir
G— L— on his new acquired Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Where would the Advantage be to
either? I declare I would not (contracted as my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is) willingly accept a
Place of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> to be confined to one Spot. I
wiſh I were once fixed at ſome Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the Country, and twice that
Sum ſhould not move me. I ſeemingly contradict myſelf, but you
underſtand my Meaning. <hi>I would not ſell my Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me beg you to write to me ſoon; I hope you will be more
capable of ſo doing than you were a while ago. Remember me

            </opener>
            <p>THE Arrival of your Servant gave me a retroſpective View of my own
intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Omiſſions, and oppreſſed me with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the Load
of an evil Conſcience. I muſt allow that Appearances make againſt me; and
yet I muſt and will aſſert, that there is no one has a truer Reſpect
for Mr. D—, a deeper Senſe of his Civilities, a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for
his Company, or a more lively De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to partake of thoſe Beauties which he
is daily diſtributing round his Situation. Of theſe laſt, Miſs F—
F— has ſometimes favoured me <pb n="220" facs="tcp:1173200201:238"/> with the greateſt
Encomiums: I am ſure ſhe knew how much I ſhould enjoy them, and might
alſo mean them as Inducements (which I never yet wanted) to haſten the
Viſit I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended you at <hi>W—.</hi> Alas! neither her Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in
giving me theſe Deſcriptions, nor mine in receiving them, were unmixed with
Pain; as ſhe was too often forced to adjoin but an indifferent Account of
poor Miſs D—'s Health. For this, and for the Affliction it occaſions
you and Mrs. D—, I really feel a Concern that I am not ſatisfied to
expreſs in the ordinary Forms of Condolence.</p>
            <p>I have paſſed this Summer in a Series of Diſſipation;
betwixt ſome Events diſagreeable enough, and others that wear at leaſt
the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Pleaſure. I have done (what <hi>I</hi> muſt call) a good
deal round my Place. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany produced new Operations, and new Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
produced almoſt daily Company. The Line of my Path is now almoſt
univerſally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Sides of Hedges, and, together with ſome
ſlighter Improvements, have been added two new Caſcades: of the firſt of
theſe, I believe you have heard ſome Account; it is <pb n="221" facs="tcp:1173200201:239"/>
really, if you'll pardon ſuch an Expreſſion from the Proprietor, a very
<hi>great</hi> Thing for the <hi>Size</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>My Servant has been <hi>weekly</hi> upon the Point of ſetting out
for <hi>D—</hi> Houſe, ever ſince the Time I firſt heard of your
Return to it: but as he is here much leſs of the Footman or Groom, than the
River-God, he has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually called upon to unlock and conduct
his Rivulets; for this Fortnight, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, or three Weeks laſt, he has been
leſs importuned on that Score; but then, during that Space, arrived a
Viſitant, who is now with me in the Houſe, and, till the Time of whoſe
Departure was aſcertained, I was unable to fix a Day when I could wait upon
you and Mrs. D—: I hope to do ſo about the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of next Week; and
will not fail to ſend TOM over upon <hi>Monday</hi> or <hi>Tueſday.</hi> If
he can be of any poſſible Service, in Regard to the Caſcades you
propoſed (and I think his Head a clear one) you are welcome to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him
over as often as you pleaſe. I have detained your Servant much beyond the

deſire my beſt Compliments to Mrs. D—, and aſſure her, that my
Muſe is not leſs at her Service, and beg your Acceptance of this Ode to,

            <p>I FIND it neceſſary to write to your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip this Week, not

Excuſes from the Stupidity with which it is my Fate to be <hi>viſited</hi>
in Winter. I have, indeed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times imagined, that I brightened up in your
Company, when I had before eſteemed it as impoſſible as that you ſhould
poliſh a Piece of Cinder or of Spunge.</p>
            <p>I have expected to ſee DODSLEY's Miſcellany advertiſed ſix
Weeks ago. Had he allowed me but one Half of this Time to deliberate, I could
have adjuſted the Share we have of it much more to my own Satisfaction. I
know but little what he has done, in Conſequence of that diſcretionary
Power, with which, through <pb n="225" facs="tcp:1173200201:243"/> mere Haſte, I was obliged
to intruſt him; and this poſſibly at a Time when his own Hurry was as
great as mine. But this I know, that in all I did myſelf, you may expect to
trace the Finger of Stupidity precipitated.</p>
            <p>Stupidity, however, is many an honeſt Man's Lot; Preſumption is
leſs excuſable; and it is with the utmoſt Humility, that I beg your
La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip's Pardon for the Liberty I took in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing what I thought
might be an Improvement of your Verſes. I have only this to plead, that you
write theſe lively Pieces almoſt extempore; that you lay no Streſs upon
them, and ſcarce ever reviſe them; that, on theſe Accounts only, I
thought it poſſible an Expreſſion not altogether exact might here and
there eſcape you; that finding my Propoſals diſapproved, I did all my
<hi>Time</hi> would allow, to cauſe DOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SLEY to have Recourſe to your
original Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; and if he <hi>have</hi> not done ſo univerſally, (as I
apprehend may be the Caſe) thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings may be reſtored in any future
Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I will reſume the Subject on ſome other Occaſion; at
preſent let me only mention, that DODSLEY, when he wrote to me laſt,
deſired my <pb n="226" facs="tcp:1173200201:244"/> Opinion, whether or no he ſhould be
thought impertinent if he preſented your Ladyſhip with a complete Set of
his Miſcellanies. It ſeems the three firſt Volumes are out of Print at
this Time; but will be reprinted in about a Month: the fourth he gives me
Reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect every Day.</p>
            <p>I am particularly glad to hear that your Health is tolerable, during
this rigorous Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it gives me Room to conceive the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage you may
derive from a better. How do I long for the Approach of Spring! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I
could travel Leagues to meet it, were it poſſible by ſo doing to bring it
faſter on its Way: and yet, unleſs it ſhould ſupply me with Health, as
well as with Company, with Spirits, as well as Spring-Flowers, and in one Word,
enliven both the Farmer, and the Farm, what would it avail? The two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Birds that were given me about three Weeks ago ſing whilſt I am writing;
ſing from Morn to Night, and that with all the Vigour which the Spring
itſelf could inſpire; yet I do not half enjoy them; my Mind is not in tune:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1173200201:245"/> the Commencement of my Spring muſt receive its Date at

               <salute>Dear Mr. GRAVES,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PARDON the Arrival of this one more Letter without a Frank; I have
ſent ſome Covers to my Lord of <hi>D—,</hi> who is down, and ſhall
probably enough receive them before I write again.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that I can leſs forgive the World than your Want
of Leiſure. Do not miſinterpret me, or take amiſs what I ſay. I know
you to be infinitely more happy than <pb n="228" facs="tcp:1173200201:246"/> myſelf, who am
cloyed with it: but it would add ſomething to my Happineſs, if not to your
own, that you had more vacant Spaces or Intervals of Time to employ in thoſe
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Amuſements, for which you are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely qualified.</p>
            <p>I am in doubt, whether I ſhould add Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos to my Seal, or not
rather cauſe the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which at preſent is rather of the
largeſt, to be contracted. Should you have ſtruck out any Thing ſince you
wrote to me, you will be ſo good as to let me know.</p>
            <p>As to Sun-Dials, I never much affected the Things themſelves, nor
indeed any Mottos with which I have ſeen them inſcribed; perhaps this
Indifference may ariſe from no very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Sources, a Reflection upon
my own Want of Proficiency in Mathematics, and an habitual Conſciouſneſs
of my own Waſte of Time. However, I have often had Thoughts of placing a
ſlight one ſomewhere upon my Premiſes, for the Sake of inſcribing it
with a Couple of Lines from VIRGIL: 
<q>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:1173200201:247"/> 
                  <l>Sed fugit interea fugit, irreparabile tempus,</l> 
                  <l>Singula dum capti circumvectamur amore.<note n="*" place="bottom">IMITATED. 
<q> 
                           <l>Meantime the Hours, th' irreparable Hours,</l> 
                           <l>Wing their ſwift Flight, while Streams, and rural
Bow'rs,</l> 
                           <l>And Love engage the Mind.</l>
                        </q>
                     </note>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All</hi> the Lines in VIRGIL afford me that Sort of Pleaſure
which one receives from melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Muſic; and I believe I am often ſtruck
with the Turn and Harmony of his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, where a Perſon leſs
attached to theſe can diſcover no great Beauty.</p>
            <p>I told you, how much I was vexed that DODSLEY did not ſuffer me to
avail myſelf of the Time that paſſed from the Correction of the
Proof-Sheets to the Publication of his Book. He has at laſt ſent me a Copy,
which I received laſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> Se'en-night. I wiſh the laſt
Stanza of WHISTLER's Verſes upon Flowers had remained as he himſelf wrote
it: but being ſomewhat diſſatisfied with the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Reading, and
having no Time left to improve it myſelf, I left it to D—, who I think
has made it worſe; however, in this Reſpect, and ſome others, it may be
proper to <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1173200201:248"/> fix one's Eye upon a ſubſequent
Impreſſion; and DODSLEY has acted as diſcreetly as it was poſſible
for him to do, conſidering what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were given him, and how
<hi>much</hi> was left to his Diſcretion. Our Contributions may be ſaid to
begin with Mr. SOMERVILLE's <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, &amp;c.</hi> Page 302; amongſt
which he has inſerted two Odes (Page 305 and 307) to which I am a Stranger.
The Song marked J. S. H. is my Neighbour Mr. H—'s, who has a pretty
Collection of Drawings, Petrefactions, and Coins. The <hi>Lady of Quality</hi>
you know; and as to all the Pieces that follow, you know the Authors of them as
well as I do. I will not anticipate your own Obſervations; but I cannot help
remarking that MILTON's <hi>Il Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeroſo</hi> has drove half our Poets
crazy: it has, however, produced ſome admirable Odes to <hi>Fancy,</hi>
amongſt which, that of WHARTON (not in this Volume) I think deſerves the
Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and after his, MERRICK's, PENSHURST, and the Ode on
<hi>Solitude</hi> are of the ſame Tribe, and are good. The <hi>Pleaſures of
Melancholy,</hi> and MARIOTT's Ode to <hi>Fancy,</hi> of the ſame Tribe, are
indifferent. There is nothing I am more pleaſed with, than Father FRANCIS's
Prayer, <pb n="231" facs="tcp:1173200201:249"/> MRS. BERKLEY repeated it to me in my
Root-Houſe this laſt Summer, and, I think, ſaid it was Mr. WEST's. I
could wiſh I had made you ſome Compliments in this Volume, for particular
Reaſons, and had reſolutely done ſo, had your own Diffidence permitted
me.</p>
            <p>I have now and then ſome Thoughts of printing that <hi>Ode to the
Ducheſs,</hi> together with ſomething ſufficient to make a twelve or an
eighteen-penny Pamphlet, about the Time the Parliament riſes; but not
unleſs it ſits till <hi>June</hi> as was reported, and not unleſs you
will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me the Favour of your Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Property of great Delicacy, to be often-times too
diffident; poſſibly then you may not long perſevere in that Manner of
ſpelling your Name, which you ſeem at preſent to prefer; yet is nothing
ſo clear to me, as that yourſelf and your Relations ſhould ſpell their
Name GREAVES to the End of the World—<hi>Nati Natorum &amp; qui

            <p>THE affectionate Letter I received from you ought to have been
anſwered by the next Poſt; it had been ſo, if I had purſued the
Dictates of a Heart, I will not ſay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1173200201:251"/> happy
in our Reconciliation, but more properly in the Manifeſtation of our
ever-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Friendſhip. I have had a large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Viſitants this
Summer, and the Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation they have occaſioned me, was for the moſt
Part very agreeable. But it muſt not be by any Acceſſion of
<hi>Pleaſure,</hi> that I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to excuſe my unſeaſonable Neglect of
writing; for Pleaſure I have in writing to my Friends, when my Mind is free
from Anxiety, and that Pleaſure connected with a Duty I owe to Friendſhip,
ſuperior to what is claimable by any mere Viſitant or Acquaintance; yet I
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but confeſs the Change which a very few Years have wrought in me; for
ſurely it is not long ſince I wearied you, and the reſt of my
Correſpondents, with my <hi>Aſſiduity</hi>; where I now write
<hi>one</hi> Letter, I then wrote <hi>twenty:</hi> mean while, the Warmth of my
Heart is not diminiſhed, with regard to Friendſhip; I know it from the
Pleaſure which the Receipt of your Letter gave me. Of this Kind are the only
Pleaſures which accompany us through Life; they encreaſe upon Repetition,
and grow more lively from Indulgence. 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Vient l'Appetit en mangeant,</hi>"</q> was, I
think, an Anſwer made <pb n="234" facs="tcp:1173200201:252"/> by a <hi>French</hi> Courtier to
his Sovereign, when it was objected to him by the latter, that there was no End
of his Importunities. But whatever odd Inſtances may be found of a perverted
Appetite, the Maxim is only univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, in regard to ſocial Pleaſure. The
Caſe is not the ſame, with regard to Pleaſures of Senſe; it is not ſo
even with regard to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Imagination. Accordingly, though I firſt
embelliſhed my Farm, with an Eye to the Satisfaction I ſhould receive from
its Beauty, I am now grown dependent upon the Friends it brings me, for the
principal Enjoyment it affords; I am pleaſed to find them pleaſed, and
enjoy its Beauties by Reflection. And thus the durable Part of my Pleaſure
appears to be, at the laſt, of the ſocial Kind.</p>
            <p>With much Willingneſs would I have waited upon your Friend Colonel
C— this Year, but for the perplexing Law-Suit in which I am involved with
young D—. It has made me rude to my Superiors, deaf to all inviting
Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and neglectful, at once, to my old Friends and my new. Pray make my
Compliments to him, and aſſure him how ſenſible I am of the 
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1173200201:253"/> Honour he has done me. Another Year, if I live, will, I
hope, make me ſome Amends for this, by affording me an Opportunity of
wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him and you.</p>
            <p>Pray alſo make my Compliments to Mr. and Mrs. P—, and Dr.
C—, and my Peace with the <hi>A—n</hi> Family, or any other where
you viſit, that may miſtake Neceſſity for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect. Above all,
recommend me to Mrs. B— in the beſt Manner you are able, which, I take

            <p>I AM truly glad to hear of your Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with our worthy Admiral,
to whom I will take the firſt Occaſion of conveying my Acknowledgments. It
is not quite clear from your Letter, whether you are Mate or Midſhipman; but
whatever your Poſt may be, I hope, and make no Doubt, that you will endeavour
to fill it as becomes you. Should you happen to be continued in the Admiral's
own Ship, you will have the Honour to ſerve more immediately under the moſt
generous Man alive; whoſe Penetration will not ſuffer any Degree of Merit
to eſcape his Notice, and who will allow yours the more Conſideration, on
Account of his Regard for me. As the beſt Means, therefore, of promoting your
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, you will need to concern yourſelf little further, than to
deſerve well; and this by an <pb n="237" facs="tcp:1173200201:255"/> uniform Courſe of
Diligence and Sobriety, by the ſtricteſt Attention to Honour and your
Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by a Conduct entirely free from all Artifice and Diſguiſe. You
have an honeſt, open Countenance; I do not in the leaſt queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that
you will verify it in your Behaviour; neither do I drop <hi>any</hi> of theſe
Hints, as though I miſtruſted your Conduct; I do unfeignedly believe them
to be every one ſuperfluous: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it may prove a Satisfaction for you to
reflect, that the Temper, which I truſt is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to you, is what I think

            </opener>
            <p>AFTER a Journey of above a Month, is it not very reaſonable to
allow a Man of my Age, a Month to reſt himſelf? I have been here indeed
ſo long; but Viſits, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Viſits, and Buſineſs, have
prevented moſt of it from being a Time of Reſt. I am now ſet down to
writing Letters, which I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe will take up another Month, for, on
caſting up my Accounts of that Kind, I found myſelf no leſs than
forty-ſeven in Debt; a Number, for which I am ſure you muſt pity me.</p>
            <p>I don't know how to thank you enough, for all the Pleaſure we had
during the Week we were at the <hi>Leaſowes.</hi> I have talked of it every
Day ſince, and dream of it a-nights. If you loved travelling as well as I do,
I ſhould <pb n="239" facs="tcp:1173200201:257"/> certainly beſeech you to come and ſtay a
Month or two here at <hi>Durham</hi>; and I ſhould be the more encouraged to
do ſo, becauſe our Friend Mr. DODSLEY left us quite in love with the Place;
(I don't mean the Town itſelf, but the Walks about it.) Indeed, if Wood, and
Water, and Wildneſs, are the Things that make a Place agreeable, we are as
muſt obliged to Nature here, and more, than any Town I have ever ſeen,
either at Home or abroad.</p>
            <p>My Obligations to you are not confined to <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> and
your delightful Paradiſe in it; but ſpread through all the Counties that we
paſſed; and increaſed, when we had Time to ſet down here, from your
Works of another Kind; they often gave me the greateſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not only
from their Spirit and Elegance, but from the good Heart that ſhines forth
throughout them. Whatever Excellencies a Writer poſſeſſes, and to
whatever Degree, this is the true Sun, that gives the nobleſt gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all
to his Compoſitions; and you muſt give me leave to ſay, that you are the
moſt ſun-ſhiny Writer of this Kind that ever warmed me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:1173200201:258"/>If, in the firſt Month that you can't walk
abroad, you would favour me with the natural Hiſtory, how, and why, and in
what Order, you laid out every Part of your Gardens, it would not only be a
Continuation of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you have given me ever ſince I ſaw you, but
would be, I dare ſay, of particular Uſe to me, as a Guide and
Aſſiſtant in many Things, and particularly in thoſe two great Articles
of Viſtos and Caſcades. What I wrote down, was a mere Skeleton of the
Ground, and was only intended to enable me to take all the Round of it,
whenever I ſhould want to do ſo, in my Imagination; but what I would beg of
you, is, a more lively Account of a Place, that is ſo much mine and every
Body's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</p>
            <p>I went from you to <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I fear too many People do,
with an Expectation of ſcarce ſeeing any Thing there worth ſeeing: but
after paſſing above one hundred Miles of it, through bad Roads, over
Mountains, by Cottages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Dirt, and a barren, bleak Country, we
were very agreeably ſurpriſed, on our Approach <pb n="241" facs="tcp:1173200201:259"/>
toward <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to find ourſelves in an open Country, well
cultivated, and in a noble View, that ſtruck us with double Pleaſure, from
our being uſed ſo long to ſee almoſt nothing but what was
diſpleaſing. When you have coaſted the <hi>Pentland</hi> Hills, and get
upon a Riſing, you ſee the City all at once, ſpread in a Line before you,
with the Caſtle to the right, the Palace and a Rock (the middle Part of which
is called ARTHUR's Seat) to the left; and a vaſt Baſon of Water (the Frith
of <hi>Forth)</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing from behind it; the Country near is varied with
little Swells and Riſings, and ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Villas; the Land ſpreads on
with a chearful and cultivated Look, and the whole is terminated with a long
Range of Hills, that grow dimmer and ruder, quite on to thoſe of the
Highlands. You may a little conceive of what an Extent this View muſt be,
when I aſſure you, that the Baſon of Water about the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of it does
not appear at all over-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and yet we were aſſured, that it was
ſixty Miles long, about thirty in the broadeſt Part, and fifteen in its
opening to the Sea. I could ſay much more of this ſame <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
but I have been already rather too diffuſive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:1173200201:260"/>When you ſee Mr. BASKERVILLE, I beg my
Compliments to him, and all the good Family. May you long enjoy the delicious
Spot you live in; and may you always look upon me as a faithful Friend, and one
of</p>

In my wild Abbey-Grounds, I have a Place that aſks for one loudly; but we

that Stile of Architecture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I hope you won't forget your Promiſe of a Viſit to

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEING gone for a few Days to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> I did not
receive the Favour of yours ſo ſoon as you might naturally imagine,
conſequently it was not in my Power to write to you by the returning Poſt;
and ever ſince being full of Employment, I deferred that Pleaſure till the
preſent Moment, which I fear will produce little worth your Attention;
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſuch as it is I give unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:1173200201:262"/>In going to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> I met with
lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing curious or entertaining, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mere Motion and
Horſe-Language are Subjects that afford no great Matter for Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. As to
the Place, it is a flat, but very pleaſant, and has the Advantage of being
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dry. The Palace has externally little to recommend it beſides Bulk,
and in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, it would excite the Admiration of my Friend Dr.
A—, who would call it a <hi>noble</hi> Pile. There are many grand Rooms
within, and ſome fine Paintings; but the Method of ſhewing ſuch Places
would not allow me much Time to examine them. The Gardens are all in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Taſte, with Ever-greens and ſtrait Canals, and ſome fine
Braſs Statues interſperſed; there is a Terraſs by the Side of the
<hi>Thames</hi> a great Length, with a Wall on one Side, and Iron Palliſades
on the other, which, from the Quantity of Iron and the Workmanſhip, will
deſerve the Approbation of thoſe who deal in that Manufacture, but I think
their leaſt Merit is in the Place they occupy. I took ſeveral Walks round
about, and the Number of Gentlemen's Seats and neat Villages in the
Neighbourhood make it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable Situation. Mr. GARRICK has built at 
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1173200201:263"/> 
               <hi>Hampton</hi> a Rotund Temple, in Honour of
SHAKESPEARE, but I could not have an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing the Inſide of
it. The Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was to go to <hi>London,</hi> the Stage was full, therefore
being very dry and pleaſant, I walked to Town; but taking Cold that Night
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at the Play, I was laid up for a Week. On my Return to
<hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> I found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides your Letter, a Card from Mr.
D—; I waited on him the next Morning, but had not the Pleaſure to find
him at Home; he has ſince, however, been ſo obliging as to call on me, when
I told him your Requeſt, which he promiſed to gratify. He was to have dined
with the Mr. K—s and me on <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt, but ſent us Word, he
had that Morning loſt ſome Blood. Mr. K— promiſes to write to you
ſoon; he gave me ſome of Mr. P—'s Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I make no
Doubt but I ſhall diſpoſe of as ſoon as I go abroad; for not having a
ſingle Article of Mourning by me, I am obliged to buy all new, and my Taylor
is a Man of ſuch Conſequence, that I have not been able to obtain the
Favour of mine from his Hands yet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:1173200201:264"/>I have not ſeen Mr. DODSLEY ſome Time; I
intend him a Viſit ſoon. I have not met yet with an <hi>Antinous.</hi> Mr.
K— and I ſhall ſome Morning ſcrutinize all the Shops in Town. It is
very odd, that not many Nights ago, I dreamt ſomebody had made you a
Preſent of one; if that ſhould happen to be the Caſe hereafter, I ſhall
have more Faith in Dreams than ever I had before.</p>
            <p>All public Diverſions were ſtopped for a Week on the Death of
the Prince of ORANGE; how the Town ſo long ſubſiſted without, and what
new Amuſement ſerved to kill Time, would be a Subject well worth knowing.
There has been a ſucceſsful Method thought of to tax Curioſity theſe
laſt three Weeks, with the Sight a famous <hi>Mohawk</hi> Warrior, armed with
his Scalping Knife, Battle Axe, &amp;c. and painted in the <hi>Indian</hi>
Manner for War: his Body is ſtained Mahogany, but his Face is made moſt
terrific by the Hand of ſome Sign-Poſt APPELLES; in his Cheeks, the Red is
very predominant; his Eye-Brows owe their Breadth and Colour to a thick
<hi>Stratum</hi> of Lamp-black, and his Noſe is not <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1173200201:265"/>
leſs remarkable for a large Line of ſable. He goes through his Exerciſe
with great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; performs the War Dance and Whoop, which is a Noiſe
unheard in this Part of the World before: all this is very fine, exceeding
curious, &amp;c. but will not you laugh when I tell you who this formidable
Hero is, <hi>Ecce ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Criſpinus!</hi> Mr. FOOTE, and no leſs a Man; if
'tis not him <hi>in propriâ perſonâ,</hi> it is one of his
Agents; 'tis certain it is no <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>; if it was, he could not bear
Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: another Circumſtance, Mr. FOOTE is miſſing, and has not
been ſeen ſince the Arrival of this <hi>Mohawk,</hi> which gives ſtrong
Proof to ſuſpect him; however, be who he will, he is a clever Fellow, and
has got a great deal of Money. To-morrow Night a new Farce is to be acted at
<hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> for the Benefit of Mr. S—, who has been ſome Time
confined in <hi>Luke</hi>'s Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>Mr. G— B— is juſt come from <hi>Bath,</hi> where he
left Mrs. P— in high Spirits, and Mr. and Mrs. B—; Mr. P— is
gone into <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> to attend a Law-Suit; ſomebody having laid
Claim to a Part of his Eſtate, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily <pb n="248" facs="tcp:1173200201:266"/> have
had uninterrupted Poſſeſſion of, for above fifty Years.</p>
            <p>Your State of one Day's Account is, I muſt confeſs, very
natural, and too often true, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in ſome Articles; in return for
it, I am promiſed by ſome Gentlemen of my Acquaintance, a true State of
their Expences one Day, which, from the Manner of the Men and Way of Life,
cannot fail of being extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Some Choice Spirits, to the Number of five
and twenty, agreed to dine at WHITE's; and the Orders were, Get a Dinner as
expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as you can poſſibly make it; which was punctually performed,
and, to their great Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and Mortification, found that the moſt
luxuriant Dinner amounted to no more than ten Pounds a Man! This Experiment
ſerved to convince them, that eating was a <hi>mean, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> Enjoyment,
and only fit for Cits and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, to whom they left it, becauſe it coſt
ſo <hi>little,</hi> and therefore confeſſed the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Gaming,
which they embraced as their <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> for the contrary
Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:1173200201:267"/>Mr. BURKE's Treatiſe on the <hi>Sublime and
Beautiful</hi> I read almoſt two Years ago, in his firſt Edition: the
Pleaſure I received from the Peruſal, will make me embrace the firſt
Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity I have of reading the ſecond—<hi>Quaere,</hi> whether Lady
COVENTRY correſponds with his Idea of Beautiful? The Study of Phyſic
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will produce in us Admiration; becauſe when we trace the
Mechaniſm of Nature phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically, as in the human Body, it becomes an
Object of the Sublime; every Step we take in ſuch Reſearches, fills us with
amazing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Wiſdom and Contrivance: but in the living Body,
Nature there conceals her Machinery, and preſents to our Eyes a ſmooth
Object, whoſe external Figure is moulded with ſuch inimitable Harmony,
ſuch an inſenſible and pleaſing Variation from the right Line,
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch a Delicacy and Tranſparency in the Skin, that it cannot
fail of exciting our Ideas of Beauty, which as <hi>they</hi> tend to relax the
Solids, will refine them into thoſe of Love. <hi>Quaere</hi> then, if that
Love may not receive additional Force in the Breaſt of an Anatomiſt, 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1173200201:268"/> from his previous Acquaintance with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Springs and Structure of ſuch an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and thereby the better qualified to
judge of the Beauty of the whole? In other Words, may not his Admiration,
co-operating with his Love, make him a more ſenſible and feeling
Obſerver? <hi>Argol,</hi> the Study of Phyſic may be ſaid (if not to
produce) to heighten Love. I ſubmit it to your Deciſion; for who can paint
Nature, muſt have <hi>felt,</hi> and who has <hi>felt</hi> is the beſt
Judge.</p>
            <p>I did not underſtand you literally, that you meant what you wrote:
but as I am, beyond what many may conceive, taken up every Hour of the Day, I
intended my Inſinuation of my Induſtry as a Plea for any ſeeming Neglect
I might be guilty of towards my Friends, in not writing to them ſo punctually
as I could wiſh; for I have known it a Maxim with many, that no People had
ſo much leiſure Time as thoſe who lived in <hi>London.</hi> But let it
not diſcourage the Oracle; let him deal out with as liberal a Hand as he
pleaſes, myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Truths, and they ſhall be applied to form 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1173200201:269"/> the Conduct of one who has the Happineſs to

            </opener>
            <p>I Received the Tobacco-Stopper, which my Friend Mr. PERCY bought at
MOODY's Shop, and alſo the Letter, to authenticate its being made of the Tree
he mentioned. I am alſo pretty well aſſured of the Truth thereof, having
lately ſeen Mr. HOBBS of <hi>Birmingham.</hi> who informs me, that he has a
Piece of the ſame Tree, which he brought from <hi>Stratford,</hi> in his
Poſſeſſion. I think the Wood much too ſpungy to carve neatly on it,
elſe ſhould <pb n="252" facs="tcp:1173200201:270"/> like to improve a Hint that Mr. HOBBS
gave me, of having a Cup or little Bowl, with ſome particular Scene out of
one of SHAKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPEARE's favourite Plays carved thereon; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if you will get
him to procure (but not at an extravagant Rate) any, or what he can of the
ſaid Mulberry-Tree, I will have ſomething made of it, as ſhall make it
advantageous to him for undertaking the ſame, if he pleaſes. I have Coins
of moſt Sorts, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and ſome of JAMES the
Firſt, therefore do not want what ſeems to me to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: however, if
that he mentions was really dug up near the Tree in SHAKESPEARE's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, I
ſhall be glad to give a ſmall Matter more than the Weight for it, and Mr.
HOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GETTS, will pay for the ſame.</p>
            <p>I will not apologize for applying to you on this whimſical
Occaſion, as I have no other Connections about your Part of the World, by
which I could procure ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of our diſtinguiſhed Bard. When I
am ſo happy as to be the Subject of your Pen next, be ſo good as to give me
your Thoughts on this Kind of <hi>Curioſity,</hi> (or whatſoever elſe 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1173200201:271"/> you pleaſe to call it) which induces us to pay a

            <p>I AM afraid you think me negligent: know then that I ſat down
laſt <hi>Thurſday,</hi> to write you a long Letter, about ſeven o'Clock
at Night, when I diſcovered that the Poſt went out at that very Hour I
ſat down to write. I had immediate Recourſe to ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation 
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1173200201:272"/> as the Caſe admitted; and ſuppoſed a Letter
received on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, might do near as well as one on
<hi>Saturday</hi> Night, conſidering that <hi>Sunday</hi> intervened, which
muſt be a leiſure Day, <hi>even</hi> for <hi>Printers.</hi> But in good
Earneſt now, do you <hi>think</hi> me lazy? Or have not you, under your
preſent <hi>Diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> an <hi>heavier</hi> Complaint againſt my
<hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence?</hi> You and I ſhall hardly agree about the <hi>Means</hi> of
<hi>eſtimating</hi> Letters; you, conſcious of your own Genius, are
deſirous to value them by their <hi>Weight</hi>; while I, conſcious of my
late <hi>Induſtry,</hi> would fix their Value by the Number of
<hi>Words.</hi> What Pretenſions, pray, can you ſuggeſt, for ſo very
<hi>perverſe</hi> a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reckoning? Is not <hi>Induſtry</hi> a
<hi>moral Virtue?</hi> And are not many written Words a <hi>Proof</hi> of
Induſtry? But though your <hi>Ingenuity</hi> be even a Miracle, you will
hardly prove it to be a <hi>moral Virtue,</hi> unleſs, indeed, in the <hi>Way
you manage it</hi>; and <hi>ſo, all</hi> your Faculties are moral Virtues:
however, we leſs <hi>artful,</hi> or leſs <hi>heroick</hi> Perſonages,
muſt magnify the Virtues that we <hi>have</hi>; of theſe, Induſtry is
one, though perhaps <hi>this</hi> had been ſcarce <hi>allowed</hi> me, till
within theſe three or four <pb n="255" facs="tcp:1173200201:273"/> Months paſt. I ſay,
that we, who are the <hi>Animae nil magnae Laudis egentes</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Souls little deſirous of Praiſe."</q>

<hi>we</hi> would appear conſiderable, pray what Method can we take? I know,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but two; the one of diſparaging <hi>your</hi> Abilities, which is
not quite ſo feaſible; the other, of taking all occaſion to magnify our
own good Qualities. If then, Induſtry be a Virtue, I am poſſeſſed of
it very remarkably: Not a Moment of my Time paſſes, but I am employed,
either in overſeeing Labourers; reading ROBINSON's <hi>Hiſtory of
Scotland</hi>; writing in my Paper Books, ('tis not material <hi>what,</hi> but
writing;) perplexing the <hi>Birmingham</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts with Sketches for
Improvements in their Manufactures, which they <hi>will</hi> not underſtand;
and laſtly, and finally, feeding my Poultry, my Ducks, my Pigeons, and my
Swans; which laſt give me as much Pleaſure, as what I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave me
Vexation. No inconſiderable Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick, <pb n="256" facs="tcp:1173200201:274"/> I'll
aſſure you! And ſurely this is not only <hi>Induſtry,</hi> but an
<hi>Induſtry</hi> of a <hi>better Kind</hi> than what employs the <hi>Animae
viles</hi> of a Drawing-room. And now this <hi>laſt Inſtance</hi> of my
great Induſtry puts me in Mind of aſking you a Queſtion:</p>
            <p>Pray now, you that are a Mythologiſt, what an abſurd Man you
are, not to jump at an Invitation to come directly to the <hi>Leaſowes?</hi>
Here am I, (like your Friend AESOP, before OGILBY's <hi>Fables</hi>; or like
ADAM, in our old <hi>Bibles</hi>) ſitting once or twice a Day with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
created Animal before me. Is not this the only Reſidence for a Perſon that
is writing Fables? 'Tis true, this very Perſon may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template better in a
<hi>Crowd,</hi> than <hi>another</hi> in the Depth of Solitude: <hi>you</hi>
may far ſurpaſs <hi>me,</hi> who thus <hi>converſe</hi> with
<hi>Birds,</hi> while he deſcribes a Sparrow from <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> or a
King-fiſher from <hi>Charing-Croſs:</hi> but <hi>Imagination</hi> is a
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <hi>Heightener</hi>; and unleſs he paints them from Life, may he
not <hi>attribute</hi> to a <hi>King-fiſher</hi> much finer Feathers than he
in Truth poſſeſſes? Pray take the Opinion of Mr. SPENCE—How I
bluſh, while I recollect that Name! <pb n="257" facs="tcp:1173200201:275"/> And yet, were it
not for my <hi>own</hi> Omiſſions, it muſt revive <hi>only</hi> my moſt
<hi>favourite</hi> Ideas. Surely 'tis written in the Book of Fate, that I
ſhall diſcharge my Debt within a Poſt or two; for Fate evidently enough
interferes, or I could never have been ſo long ſilent. I am almoſt
aſhamed to deſire my humble Reſpects to him, and yet it is impoſſible
for me to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my Feelings.</p>
            <p>I muſt now proceed to Buſineſs. Paſt ſix o'Clock once
more; but the Poſt now goes out at ten. If you <hi>can</hi> procure me the
quarto Cuts for MILTON, it will be a very deſirable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>Mr. BOND has made ſome Alteration in your <hi>Grove,</hi> which I
thought very pretty on its <hi>Arrival</hi>; yet, perhaps, he may be right
enough, if Mr. GRIGNION can comprehend his Meaning. The Trees he means <hi>on
the wrong Side the Water,</hi> are ſome of thoſe oppoſite to the Letter
<hi>S,</hi> which I have put upon the Back: but I am fearful of
<hi>ſpoiling</hi>; and muſt beg Mr. GRIGNION would re-compare the Print
with Mr. BOND's original Drawing, then retouch his <pb n="258" facs="tcp:1173200201:276"/>
Plate, and let me have a few more Proof-Sheets of both the Prints. Give me one
or two Lines by <hi>Return</hi> of Poſt, if poſſible.</p>
            <p>No Books ready? I want MALLET's Works, bound in <hi>Ruſſia</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is, perhaps, no uncommon Caſe for the Magnitude of a Debt to
prevent, or at leaſt retard every Step toward a Diſcharge. In Truth, the
many Favours you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon me by the Packet I have received 
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1173200201:277"/> for <hi>E—,</hi> have made me aſhamed of ſuch
a partial Payment, as my Health and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure would permit; when I complain of
Health, I mean no other than a Kind of Drowſihead and Lentor which has
ſomewhat infeſted me at this Seaſon; perhaps it were better expreſſed
by that diſreputable Name, Stupidity: be that, however, as it may, it is by
this chiefly, I have been diſqualified from thoſe refined Sorts of
Amuſement, in which your Letters and Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets required me to engage.</p>
            <p>I have been expected to paſs a Week at <hi>Shiffnal,</hi> ever
ſince the Beginning of <hi>May,</hi> where I was by particular Appointment to
meet our Friend Mr. BINNEL. The Viſit is not laid aſide, but will probably
take Place in about a Fortnight's Time or leſs. One Pleaure I expect from it,
beſide what I ſhall reap from Mr. PITT and Mr. SLANEY's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and that
turns upon the Opportunity it will afford me of peruſing your OVID in
Conjunction with Mr. BINNEL; and it has been with this View, in ſome
Meaſure, that I have deferred the Examination you deſired me to beſtow
upon it. In general, I would <pb n="260" facs="tcp:1173200201:278"/> wiſh you to make it as
juſt to the Author's Senſe, and to your own Sentiments, as you can, and
afterwards conſider me as a mere Muſic Maſter, whom you would employ to
tune your Harpſichord; in other Words, as a proper Perſon to retrench any
little Encroachments upon Simplicity, Eaſe of Style, or Harmony.</p>
            <p>I want to communicate many Things; but muſt defer moſt of them
till I ſee you. And pray let Mrs. PERCY know me for one of your peculiar

            <p>Mr. DODSLEY in his laſt Letter deſired, I would preſent you
with his new Edition of <hi>Cleone,</hi> which is the only one you ſhould

hundred Places merely, and altered in about ſix. I will either keep it till

            <p>I Finiſhed my Peregrinations the Day before you began yours; for
the Day after my Arrival at this Place, I called at your Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, and was
informed you ſet off that very Morning for Mr. SHENSTONE's. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thought you, in many Reſpects, a Man to be envied; but in your preſent
Situation, you are in Poſſeſſion of a Happineſs too great for
Mortals; enjoying in one of the hotteſt Seaſons that ever was known in
<hi>England,</hi> the Shade and Coolneſs of the fineſt Groves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in
the World, rendered ſtill more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting by the Converſation of one of
the beſt Poets, as well as one of the worthieſt Men of the Age. A certain
Monarch of old <pb n="263" facs="tcp:1173200201:281"/> broke off all Connexion and Alliance with
a Brother King in <hi>Greece,</hi> for no other Reaſon, but becauſe the
other experienced an uncommon Share of Felicity. If his Example deſerved to
be followed, you are the Man of all others, whoſe Friendſhip I would
renounce. But the Truth is, you cannot have more Happineſs than I wiſh you;
nor more, I am perſuaded, than you deſerve; and therefore, I will e'en be
contented to hold on my Amity with you, till I have a better Reaſon for
parting with it, which I am very ſure I ſhall never be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with.</p>
            <p>With Reſpect to my own Travels, I have little to ſay worth
relating. Finding my Health not equal to ſo long a Journey as to
<hi>Scarborough,</hi> and the Weather at the ſame Time proving extremely cold
and wet, I turned out of the high Road at <hi>Newark,</hi> and croſſed the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to <hi>Nottingham.</hi> As I found the Air of the Place agree with me,
and likewiſe met with an old Friend, who lives like a true <hi>Arcadian,</hi>
in a little rural Cottage, at a ſhort Diſtance from the Town, I continued
there till my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn hither. I ſaw every Thing in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood 
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1173200201:282"/> worth looking at; but what pleaſed me moſt was Lord
BYRON's Abbey upon the Foreſt, which without Doubt you have viſited. Adieu,

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHAT Apology can I make for not writing to you now for more than a
Month, after receiving ſo much Pleaſure and ſo many Civilities? However,
as you too well know how eaſy it is for ſuch Things to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, I will make
none, but leave you to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them
that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> And this would lead me to expoſtulate
with you for not coming <pb n="265" facs="tcp:1173200201:283"/> to <hi>Bath:</hi> but I forbear,
having many Things to be pardoned in myſelf, as well as many to deliver to
you, and therefore ſo much for Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen <hi>Persfield,</hi> Mr. MORRIS's Seat; and Mr. SPENCE
was juſt come from ſeeing it, when he arrived at <hi>Bath:</hi> he is much
ſtruck with it, and has attempted ſomewhat towards a Deſcription of it. I
ſhall have a Copy of his Papers ſoon, and will tranſmit it to you. The
Place is certainly of the great and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Kind; moſt of the near Views
are ſeen below you from the Top of high Precipices, conſiſting of ſteep
Rocks, hanging Woods, the Rivers <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Wye,</hi> which laſt
winds about the Feet of the Rocks below you, in a very romantic Manner,
almoſt ſurrounding a very pretty Farm, where Cattle and Sheep are feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Meadows, at ſuch a Depth below your Eye, that they ſeem very much
diminiſhed. The Rocks are bold and numerous, half co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Woods, and
riſe almoſt perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular from the Edge of the Water to a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
Height, forming, from the great Cliff, a Kind of double Amphitheatre. A Gun
fired <pb n="266" facs="tcp:1173200201:284"/> from the Top of this Cliff, creates, by the
Reverberation of the Report amongſt other Rocks, a loud Clap of Thunder, two
or three Times repeated, before it dies away: but even this Echo, conformably
to the Pride and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the Reſt of the Place, will not deign to
anſwer a ſmaller Voice than that of a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; with a Culverin, I
ſuppoſe, it would hold a noble Dialogue. The Town of <hi>Chepſtow,</hi>
and its ruined Caſtle, appear in the near View at ſomewhat more than the
Diſtance of <hi>Hales Owen</hi> from your Grove; and the romantic Windings of
the <hi>Wye</hi> are ſeen all the Way to them, except now and then that its
Stream is hid among the Rocks; and all the Way below them, till it is
ſwallowed up by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> at about two miles Diſtance, where
that River is alſo near two Miles over, and from whence it extends, enlarging
in Breadth, quite down to <hi>King-Road,</hi> below <hi>Briſtol.</hi> I can
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing finer than theſe Views would be, were the Waters of the
Rivers as clear as that of the <hi>Thames:</hi> but, alas! they are ſo muddy,
that they will ſcarce return the Images of the Rocks, Trees, and other
Objects, that riſe upon their Banks. The diſtant Views are very
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, <pb n="267" facs="tcp:1173200201:285"/> and lets the Eye into Parts of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
different Counties. The Extent of the Walks is near four Miles, which in about
five Hours Time I made ſhift to accompliſh. I went from <hi>Bath</hi> with
a polite Party of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Ladies, and our three Days Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion was
altogether exceedingly agreeable.<note n="*" place="bottom">I am this Inſtant

               <salute>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Suppoſe you have ſome Time ago received from my Brother the
Things you ordered. I deſired him to ſend them, as alſo the Poems for Mr.
WOODHOUSE, to whom I beg my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, and am ſorry he had them not
ſooner, but I had really forgot them. I have been ſuch a Rambler ſince I
came to Town, that I have not had Time to attend to any Thing. I have not
written a ſingle Fable ſince that I ſent you, and yet am ſo
unreaſonable, as to wonder you have not ſent me your half Dozen. I am
writing an Eſſay on Fable, and thinking of a Preface, both of which I
ſhall deſire you to take the Trouble of reading and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſoon
as I have done them; however, I believe I ſhall take your Advice, and not
think of printing this Winter. I was glad to hear you had ſome Hopes of
finiſhing your <pb n="272" facs="tcp:1173200201:290"/> Affairs with Mr. D—, and hope
they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated to your Satisfaction. I have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with a Letter
from Mr. WREN, which I anſwer by this Poſt. You ſaid, my Lord LYTTELTON
was to be at the Admiral's till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtmas, but I ſaw him paſs by
in his Chariot a few Days ago. You have given me Hopes of ſeeing a Survey of
your Farm; I beg you will not delay what will give me ſo much Pleaſure:
would to God you would bring it yourſelf, with all your verbal
Deſcriptions, Mottoes, &amp;c. and let them be engraved and printed. I wiſh
I could hear that you was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat. What think you of an Elegy on
the Death of General WOLFE? You know, I ſuppoſe that he was to have been
married to a Siſter of —, before he went on his laſt Expedition, but
that ſhe deſired it might be deferred till his Return. I think the Scene
might be laid in her Chamber, on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing Night for the taking of
<hi>Quebec</hi>; her Friends may be ſuppoſed to have concealed his Death
from her, and her Anxiety for his Welfare, in the Midſt of the Rejoicings,
might have a fine Effect: when ſuddenly his Ghoſt ſhould appear, inform
her of his Fate, and <pb n="273" facs="tcp:1173200201:291"/> endeavour to comfort her in her
Affliction. Here is Room for Deſcription, Reflection, and the true Pathetic.
Such a Story as this in your Hands could not fail to be fine: I wiſh you to
try, and that right ſoon.</p>
            <p>I have ſearched all the Shops in <hi>London</hi> for a
<hi>Pan</hi> proper for the Subject we talked of, but in vain. What think you
of the encloſed Sketch? I think it might be mended. Is not the left Hand
raiſed too high?</p>
            <p>I had written thus far on <hi>Saturday</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, when your
Letters and Plans arrived by the Penny-Poſt, which determined me to ſtay
till <hi>Tueſday</hi> before I finiſhed my Letter. You have now
embarraſſed me; I have ſo many Things to reply to, that I know not where
to begin: I muſt take them as they lie.</p>
            <p>Did I ever tell you of Mr. P—'s <hi>Chineſe</hi> Novel? If I
did, I have quite forgot it, and will therefore never own it. I ſhall be very
glad to ſee Mr. H—'s Picture: my Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to him, and tell him, I
ſuſpect he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it as a reconciling Preſent to Miſs S—. 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1173200201:292"/> I wiſh Mr. ALCOCK would finiſh my two Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for
the Fables; as to my Face, it is a Subject not worth conſidering; however, I
will make you an impudent Propoſal: if you will exchange Faces with me when
you come up to Town, we will both ſit to the ſame Painter.
Notwithſtanding you have taken Pains to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all Claim to Favour from Mr.
SPENCE, I am very well ſatisfied, the Letter you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe will effectually
cancel all your Offences: I ſhall go down to him in about a Month, (you ſee
I give you Time enough) encloſe it to me, and I will carry it to him, with
one of your ſmall Plans, to which I will put Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; at the ſame Time,
I will endeavour to get the <hi>Scotch</hi> Paper on Gardening. As to my Sketch
of the <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> I have not yet had Time to think of it; but as
ſoon as I have finiſhed my Eſſay, eſpecially if you make it
unneceſſary for me to write any more Fables, by ſending me your half
Dozen, I will certainly ſit down to it; you ſee I am willing to make good
Bargains. The Ducheſs of SOMERSET's Letters I have ſafe, and will ſend
them to you. I am glad Mr. GRAVES is going on; and doubt not but the Work 
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1173200201:293"/> will turn to his Advantage. I ſhall certainly not
print the Fables this Winter; and as to the Eſſay, I hope to have gone
through it in about a Fortnight. I have read Dr. HAWK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SWORTH's
<hi>Adventurer</hi> on the Subject, in which I exactly agree with you; and I
have read a bad Tranſlation of LA MOTTE's Eſſay: I know nothing elſe on
the Subject worth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. When I ſend you my Eſſay, I beg you will give
it any Improvement which you may think it wants, either in correcting
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, or in ſupplying Deficiencies. I have got ſix more new
Fables from Dr. L—.</p>
            <p>Do not think that I will tamely hear my Friend's <hi>Cuſtard</hi>
abuſed; I ſhall certainly find a Time to vindicate his Honour, and to make
your proud Foreigner own the ſuperior Merit of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Cuſtard.</p>
            <p>And now for your Plans: I am much obliged to you for ſending them;
and if I might have my Wiſh, I would engrave the ſmall coloured one, with
Figures of Reference. This ſhould be the Frontiſpiece to a Pamphlet, which
ſhould contain a Deſcription of the Places and Things referred to,
ſomewhat more at large <pb n="276" facs="tcp:1173200201:294"/> than they are in this Drawing;
together with all your Mottos, Verſes, Compliments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
alſo a verbal Deſcription of the riſing and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ground; the
Objects, Proſpects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the Way round. In the Middle of the
Title-Page, I would put the laſt Plate of VIRGIL's <hi>Grove</hi>; as a
Head-piece at the Beginning of the Pamphlet, I would have a Print of your
Houſe; and at the End, which ſhould be contrived to be almoſt a whole
Page, I think the chief Caſcade might be placed. The Plate ſhould be worked
off in Green; the Road through the Path round the Houſe, and the Water,
ſhould be afterwards coloured by Hand. Think of theſe Things; and may
Heaven give you Reſolution to put them in practice!</p>

            <p>HEALTH, Happineſs, and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments of the Seaſon, to
dear Mr. SHENSTONE! I have enquired of all the SPILS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BURY's in Town, but I
cannot find that my little Drawings are yet ſent up. This, if Mr. ALCOCK be
ſtill with you, I wiſh you would be ſo good as to tell him, with my
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments. When am I to expect an Anſwer to my laſt long Letter? And
when am I to have your half dozen Fables? I have ſent my 
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1173200201:296"/> Preface, and my Eſſay on Fable, to Mr. GRAVES, by
this Night's Poſt, with a Deſire, that he will tranſmit them to you in a
Poſt or two. When you get them, I ſhall be very glad if you will look them
carefully and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically over: they are both very ſhort; and there are blank
Pages on one Side, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Alterations or Remarks you ſhall favour me
with. I beg you will be ſo good as to let me have them back, with your
Fables, as ſoon as poſſible. I ſhall not publiſh this Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but I
want to have all my Materials to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that I may begin to think of
diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them in the Order they are to ſtand.</p>
            <p>I have Compliments to you from Mr. SPENCE, and he is much obliged to
you for the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of your Farm. He has never been able to get DALRYMPLE's
<hi>Eſſay on Garden Grounds.</hi> I encloſe a few Lines on the
<hi>Leaſowes.</hi> If you ſhould think them not totally unworthy of the
Subject, I ſhould be glad if you would pleaſe to beſtow ſuch Correction
upon them as you may think will tend to their good. I have other Matters to
communicate to you, and to adviſe with you about; but you have 
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1173200201:297"/> ſo much upon your Hands already, from my laſt Letter
and this, that I will not diſcourage you from ſitting down to write to me,

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM with you aware, that the Story of the <hi>Spaniſh Lady</hi>
is rather too ſimple, too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Matter for the Generality of People
who frequent the Galleries of a <hi>London</hi> Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; but might not ſome
Incidents of Humour be extracted from the Group of Sailors, which muſt
neceſſarily be introduced in the Piece? There are in real Life various, and
very ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Characters among our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tars. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1173200201:298"/> much Uſe has been made of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and to very
pleaſing Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, I propoſe (or rather merely <hi>allow</hi>) this
Violation of the Simplicity of the Story, as a Means to make it anſwer the
Purpoſes of Emolument to you, if you chooſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it; for, as far
as relates to my own Taſte, I think, even in Repreſentation, it could not
be preſerved too ſimple.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration that an Author is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to forego, in many
Inſtances, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Intention, renounce a Compliance with his own
Judgment, and even ſometimes abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the very Excellencies of his Genius,
to gratify the vitiated Taſte of a few noiſy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, who otherwiſe
would condemn the Work, is rather melancholy; and could not by any Species of
Reaſon be ſupported, except that which you advanced, namely, that your
Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres in <hi>London</hi> are maintained in theſe Days at a very great
Expence, and that Expence muſt be repaid; conſequently, if SHAKESPEARE
cannnot elicit a full Houſe, HARLEQUIN muſt extort it; but woe the while
for the State of <pb n="281" facs="tcp:1173200201:299"/> Letters and Genius!—Such was not
the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine End and Intention of a Theatre. I, for my own Part, look upon it
as a Temple raiſed to <hi>Moral Virtue</hi>; the Deſign of it is to
inſtruct through the Medium of Delight; to ſhew Virtue and Vice in their
reſpective Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: and the Buſineſs of the Audience is, to judge,
compare, define, to diſtinguiſh between what is given for Example, and what
for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution: ſo conducted and preſerved, a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre truly merits the
Denomination I have given it; but if <hi>Moral</hi> is to ſubmit to
<hi>Matter,</hi> if <hi>fine Sentiment</hi> is to give Way to <hi>fine
Scenery,</hi> it falls from the Purpoſes for which is was originally
inſtituted, and becomes a Place of <hi>Shew</hi> indeed, but not of
<hi>Science,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe Abſurdities and Misfortunes are owing to the Audience;
and it is much to be lamented, that the Conductor of an uſeful Place of
Amuſement cannot oppoſe and rectify them; but I clearly ſee he cannot.
Your Anecdote of Mr. GARRICK's laudable Attempt, ſome Years ago, to remove
from public View an annual Object of Indecorum and Immorality, and
ſubſtitute a Piece, which (however antique) <pb n="282" facs="tcp:1173200201:300"/>
furniſhed Matter for the moral HOGARTH to diſplay his Genius on, diverts me
much, and would (were I of any Country beſide <hi>England)</hi> moſt
probably aſtoniſh me. As an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> it does not. The Attempt
was as much to the Credit of Mr. GARRICK, as the Defeat of it was
diſreputable to the Audience.<note n="*" place="bottom">It had been a Cuſtom
at both the royal Theatres, for many Years, to perform the <hi>London
Cuckolds</hi> on the Lord-Mayor's Day; Mr. GARRICK, from Motives of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
endeavoured to ſubſtitute the old Play of <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward-Hoe</hi>; but the
Audience exploded it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This Subject might, I think, by itſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Matter for a
tolerably-ſized Eſſay; and I marvel that ſome Writer, who has rather
more Affection for the Uſe of a Pen than myſelf, does not adopt it. A
Reflection on the very ſevere Trial a dramatic Writer undergoes, when he
offers his Work to the Public, has frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called forth my Compaſſion;
the Means to procure general Approbation are ſo vague and precarious, that I
almoſt wonder when I hear of any one hardy enough to ſtand a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for
it.</p>
            <p>My Zeal in theſe Particulars has made me deviate from the
principal Object of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <pb n="283" facs="tcp:1173200201:301"/> which was to requeſt
you to make a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sketch of my favourite Story upon drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Principles,
during the Courſe of this Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and let us <hi>(Deo favente)</hi> when
next we meet at the <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> ſee how the Deſign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears. It
may be an agreeable Amuſement, if it anſwers no other Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Whether I may ever execute the Elegy which Mr. DODSLEY has
recommended, is very uncertain, though I much approve his Plan. Suppoſe you
were to attempt it—I have ſome Reaſons for thinking that Elegy would
ſuit your Diſpoſition and Abilities. The Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of DODSLEY's
Application<note n="*" place="bottom">See Letter lxviii. <hi>Dec.</hi> 1,
1759.</note> to me has procured me <hi>twelve</hi> Lines, for which I hold
myſelf indebted. You do not tell me who they were written by, ſo I
ſuppoſe I am to aſk no Queſtions.</p>
            <p>When you get any more ſuch original Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, your communicating
them will be a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. While I am thus a Winter Solitudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, while

            <p>SCARCE was I ſat down after our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Jaunt, when I was
welcomed by my dear Mr. SHENSTONE's polite Favour. You are particularly good in
conferring ſo much Honour on a poor, prattling, inſignificant Being like
me; yet, however ill I may confeſs I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in my Ability to repay it,
I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to affirm, that my Merits, if rated by the Value I ſet on it,
are equal to thoſe of any other wild Female in the Circle of your
Acquaintance. But is it come to this? And muſt I really take Pen in Hand, and
deſcribe our little Peregrinations? I muſt, for you have commanded me. If I
even wanted an Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond your Command, it is at Hand. I mean our
common Friend, Mr. HULL. I applied to him for Counſel, and he flatly ſays,
I ſhall be <hi>rude,</hi> if I decline to obey. Here then, my 
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1173200201:304"/> good Sir, take it in the beſt Manner I am able to
execute a deſcriptive Letter, and if it is badly done, you muſt be my
Advocate to yourſelf, for having drawn me into ſuch a Dilemma; in ſhort,
your own humane Heart muſt make Allowances for whatever is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy your
Judgment.</p>
            <p>Be it known unto you then, that laſt <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi>
Morning, we all four (you know our Party) got into a Coach, at ſix o'Clock,
and drove at no ſlow Rate, for we got to <hi>Briſtol</hi> at eight. There
we were met by a Gentleman and a Lady from the Hot-well, as wild and as
whimſical as ourſelves; we are all of a Spinning I can tell you. We juſt
took a Bit of Breakfaſt at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and then made the beſt of
our Way to <hi>Auſt,</hi> the old Paſſage over to <hi>Wales</hi>; there
we dined, and then, after dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long Way over the Rocks, amongſt
Sea-Weed, and I can't tell what, with ſome Difficulty we got into a
<hi>Stable,</hi> in which we were to croſs the Water—A Stable! methinks
I hear you ſay—Why yes, in Truth, good Sir; for pray what can one
better compare a Thing to, that was littered from one End to the 
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1173200201:305"/> other with dirty Straw, and filled with as many Horſes
as People? Oh, we went moſt ſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly over, Horſes, Coach, and
ourſelves, all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: this, however, was the worſt of the Bargain, all
the beſt was to come.</p>
            <p>When we arrived in <hi>Wales,</hi> we juſt took a little
Refreſhment, and then drove to <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> remarkable for the great
Height of its Bridge, the Tide riſing higher by ſome Degrees there than in
any Part of the three Kingdoms. At this Place we were to ſleep, ſo we went
to the beſt Inn to get Accommodations. Theſe ſecured, we made the beſt
of our Way to <hi>Persfield,</hi> the Seat of Mr. MORRIS; and ſuch a Place,
for the Variety and Beauty of its Proſpects, I never ſaw.</p>
            <p>The Gardens are ſeven Miles round, ſo our poor old Lady was
forced to occupy a Seat juſt by the Houſe, and the reſt of us then walked
as far as our Legs were able to carry us. We could not compaſs the whole
round, but ſaw all the principal Proſpects. To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt deſcribing them
is impoſſible, at leaſt to do it with Juſtice to their Merit, yet,
though <pb n="288" facs="tcp:1173200201:306"/> unequal to the Taſk, I muſt ſay
ſomething. The Gardens are ſituated on the <hi>Rocks,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call
them the <hi>Banks,</hi> of the River <hi>Wye,</hi> and cut into Walks, in
themſelves exceſſively beautiful, but the ſuperior Beauty of the Views
they command, ſo entirely engroſſes the Eye, that they can be very little
heeded. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we look down upon the River, from an Eminence of near four
hundred Feet, which winds itſelf round as in a Semi-circle. The oppoſite
Side is bounded by Rocks of equal Height, ſome barren, and reſembling the
Ruins of old Fortifications; others covered with the moſt pleaſing Variety
of Greens the Eye can wiſh to behold, while at the Bottom, Cattle are feeding
in the ſweet Paſtures by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's Side: Cattle, we were told the
Creatures were which we ſaw; but really our Faith had need be ſtrong to
believe it, ſince they appeared to our View more like Hens and Chickens, and
I do aſſure you, one of our Company took them for ſuch.</p>
            <p>Here too we ſaw a Place called the <hi>Lover's-Leap,</hi> it was
at the Summit of a Rock full four hundred Feet high from the River, and 
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1173200201:307"/> I believe, if uſed, would be a certain Cure for Love
or any other Kind of Trouble. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having delighted our Eyes as long as our
Feet would ſupport us, we went back to the reverend Lady; and one of our
Company being acquainted with a Lady at Mr. MORRIS's Houſe, we were invited
to eat a Bit of Cake and drink a Glaſs of Wine; this was a moſt agreeable
Repaſt after our Fatigue, and helped us on very notably. But here, methinks,
I hear you ſay, Alas, the poor old Lady! She ſaw none of theſe fine
Sights!—Yes, but ſhe did, Sir, as you ſhall hear: We had a Servant of
Mr. MORRIS's to attend our Coach, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us through various Fields
to ſome Views we had not ſeen in the Part of the Gardens we walked over,
and from theſe the reverend Dame feaſted her Eyes; ſo you ſee ſhe
came in for a Share of the Show.</p>
            <p>We now returned to <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> where, after ſpending as
laughable an Evening as could be deſired, (I have before told you, we were
all of a Spinning) we retired to reſt, a Thing not at all unpleaſing after
the Employment of the Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:1173200201:308"/>Next Morning we got into a large Boat, with
two Pair of Oars, and went up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Wye,</hi> to a Place called
<hi>Tintern-Abbey.</hi> Here we had the extreme Pleaſure of contemplating the
moſt curious Piece of Ruins I ever beheld; I do not believe your
<hi>Balbecks</hi> or <hi>Palmiras</hi> can much exceed it. It is the Remains of
a Cathedral; all the outſide Walls remain ſo far entire, as to be a Fence
to keep People out, but are in a cracked, ruinous State; moſt of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
on the Inſide are ſtanding, though robbed of the fine Carving which adorned
them; yet we had ſome Notion of their former Beauty, from many Pieces
tolerably intire, which lay ſcattered here and there on the Ground. Graſs
and Wood Strawberries here ſupply the Place of a Pavement, except in one
ſmall Part, where it has not yet been broken. Here is diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a very
pretty Kind of Tile OF Stone, the Ground yellow, flowered with black.</p>
            <p>The Top of the Church is entirely off, ſo that Birds build all
around in the Pillars and Walls. There are planted a great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Trees in
many Parts of the Edifice, <pb n="291" facs="tcp:1173200201:309"/> ſome Fruit-Trees: I
myſelf eat three Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries I gathered in the Body of the Church. This
Place, it ſeems, was dedicated to the Virgin MARY, and Part of an Image
remains, which ſtill bears ſome Reſemblance to her. There is likewiſe
one of an Earl of PEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BROKE, formerly Lord of the Place; that Earl who was
ſirnamed <hi>Strong-Bow,</hi> and as Tradition ſays, who had five Fingers
and two Thumbs on each Hand; one Hand of the monumental Figure is ſo perfect,
that we could diſtinguiſh the five Fingers and two Thumbs. In ſhort, I
never in my Life ſaw any Place ſo well worth viſiting of its Kind as this
<hi>Tintern-Abbey,</hi> and we were as loath to quit it, as I ſeem now to be
of finiſhing my wild Deſcription.</p>
            <p>Next we went to look at ſome Iron Works, and ſaw the Manner of
making Bar Iron, and Drawing of Wire. After this we got again into our Boat, to
return to <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> and as we rowed along the River, had the
Pleaſure of looking up to thoſe beautiful Rocks we had looked down from, in
Mr. MORRIS's Ground. This Reverſe of View made a ſecond Enjoyment, and we
were more ſenſible of the <pb n="292" facs="tcp:1173200201:310"/> Height of the Mountains in
this Situation, than when we were at the Summit of them. So delightful was this
Water-Scene, that we all wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Continuance of it. This put us upon
aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Maſter of the Boat, if he could ſafely ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to land us in
<hi>England</hi>; he aſſured us he could, and then it was reſolved,
<hi>nem. con.</hi> only to ſtop at <hi>Chepſtow</hi> to dine—we did
ſo, and ſending our Carriage and Horſes to the Paſſage, to be again
taken over in the before-mentioned Stable, we went on board our Boat, and rowed
till we got into the <hi>Severn,</hi> and then the Wind favouring us, we had a
moſt charming ſail to the oppoſite Shore. Here we had another Piece of
Variety; the River was not deep enough from the Rocks to bring the Boat to dry
Ground, nor ſhallow enough to let the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages come to us, ſo we were all
compelled to be carried out on Men's Shoulders.</p>
            <p>We drank Tea at the old Paſſage-Houſe, and then drove to the
Hot-well, <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but made <hi>King's-Weſton-Down</hi> in our
Way, which, for the Beauty of its Proſpects, could well vie with what we had
been ſeeing in <hi>Wales.</hi> Next Morning our firſt Route was up to
<hi>Clifton,</hi> 
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:1173200201:311"/> where we ſaw Mr. GOLDNEY's Grotto;
of its Kind, to be ſure, the moſt finiſhed Thing; all Deſcription
muſt fail to do it Juſtice, ſo let your Imagination form the moſt
regular, elegant, coſtly Arrangement of Shells it is able, and it can't go
beyond the real Beauty.</p>
            <p>From a Part of Mr. GOLDNEY's Garden, we had a Proſpect I think

               <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PRAY never think Excuſe can be neceſſary to me about
Exactneſs in anſwering my Letters; I am always glad to hear from you when
it is agreeable to you to write, but am not one of thoſe over-kind Friends
who are for ever out of Humour with thoſe whom they rather enthrall than
oblige, by giving them that Name. As a Proof I never wiſh to act ſo by my
Friends, or am afraid of being treated ſo by them, I will own to you, I am
not quite ſure, I ſhould have anſwered your laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo ſoon,
were it not that I am under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Concern to find how aukwardly I muſt
have expreſſed myſelf to Mr. SHENSTONE, if I gave him Room to believe, I
harboured a ſecret Wiſh to have ſo fine a Poem as his Ode 
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1173200201:314"/> ſuppreſſed. On the contrary, I ſhould think
myſelf guilty of a very great Crime and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to the Public, if I were
to be the Means of depriving them of ſo charming and rational an
Entertainment. I gave him the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in my Letter, for deſiring that
my own Name, nor that of my humble yet peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Dwelling, might be inſerted.
You know I always envied the Lot of 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>La Viſlette, qui ſe cache ſous
l'Herbe.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, my dear Lady LUXBOROUGH, Times are changed with us,
ſince no Walk was long enough, or Exerciſe painful enough to hurt us, as we
childiſhly imagined; yet after a Ball or Maſquerade, have we not come Home
very well contented to pull off our Ornaments and fine Cloaths, in order to go
to reſt? Such methinks is the Reception we naturally give to the Warnings of
our bodily Decays; they ſeem to undreſs us by Degrees, to prepare us for a
Reſt that will refreſh us far more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than any Night's Sleep could
do. We ſhall then find no Wearineſs from the Fatigues which either our
Bodies or our Minds have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone; but all Tears ſhall be wiped from our 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1173200201:315"/> Eyes, and Sorrow, and Crying, and Pains, ſhall be no
more; we ſhall then without Wearineſs move in our new Vehicles, tranſport
ourſelves from one Part of the Skies to another, with much more Eaſe and
Velocity, than we could have done in the Prime of our Strength, upon the
fleeteſt Horſes, the Diſtance of a Mile. This chearful Proſpect enables
us to ſee our Strength fail, and await the Tokens of our approaching
Diſſolution with a Kind of awful Pleaſure. I will ingenuouſly own to
you, dear Madam, that I experience more true Happineſs in the retired Manner
of Life that I have embraced, than I ever knew from all the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour or
Flatteries of the World. There was always a Void: they could not ſatisfy a
rational Mind: and at the moſt heedleſs Time of my Youth, I well remember,
that I always looked forward, with a Kind of Joy, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Retreat, when
the Evening of Life ſhould make it practicable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boadicea</hi> I have read—there is an intereſting Scene
or two in it; but there is ſomething wanting in the Management of the Drama
to keep up the Spirits of the Audience. <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> 
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:1173200201:316"/> I have not ſeen, nor have heard ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of
it, as to raiſe my Curioſity. If you have not read <hi>Deformity,</hi> an
Eſſay, by Mr. HAY, nor his <hi>Religio Philoſophi</hi> (I don't know how
that laſt Word ſhould end) I believe they will entertain you very well in
their different Ways. The <hi>Adventurer</hi> will ſoon be publiſhed in
Volumes, and will be very well worth buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I doubt I muſt agree with Mr.
SHEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONE, that the Stile of <hi>Sir Charles Grandiſon</hi> is too prolix,
and yet I don't know any of it I ſhould be willing to part with, except
<hi>Harriot Byron</hi>'s Converſation with the <hi>Oxonian,</hi> in the
firſt Volume, and the Preparations and Entertainments at Sir
<hi>Charles</hi>'s Wedding, in the fifth.</p>
            <p>When I came home from taking the Air on <hi>Friday,</hi> I was very
agreeably ſurpriſed to find Lady NORTHUMBERLAND ready to receive me, as I
had no Notion of her coming. She had been alarmed with a falſe Report, that I
had not been ſo well for ſome days as ſhe left me. I took the Opportunity
of ſhewing her your Letter, and ſhe deſired me to make her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
to your Ladyſhip, and tell you, ſhe <pb n="299" facs="tcp:1173200201:317"/> keeps no Servant
about Lady ELIZABETH, while ſhe is at School, and at her Return will think it
neceſſary to have a Perſon of a middle Age about her. Such a one ſhe
now has about her little Boy; a pretty Sort of Woman, who ſpeaks
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> equally well, is grave and properly
behaved, and, I believe, hopes for Lady ELIZABETH's Place, when her little
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of a Maſter goes into the Hands of the Men. His Mamma took him away
with her on <hi>Saturday,</hi> after lending him to me for a Month (though
ſhe is exceſſively fond of him) becauſe ſhe ſees he is the Joy of
my Life. He has ſome faint Reſemblance (though not a good one) of his poor
Uncle; but his Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mildneſs of Temper are the very ſame. Her
eldeſt Boy too, is a very ſenſible and good one. He and Lady GREVILLE
dine with me from <hi>Eaton</hi> every <hi>Sunday</hi>; they are here at
preſent for two or three Days, on Account of their being Hollidays. I have
hardly left my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Room to make Mr. COWSLAD's Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and

               <salute>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM very glad, that with the Return of Spring, your Strength and
Spirits begin alſo to revive. May they proceed and encreaſe with the
Seaſon, and communicate ſuch Health and Vigour to your vernal Shoots, as
will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and enable them to bud, bloſſom, and bear; for 'tis Pity,
that Fruit of ſo exquiſite a Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſhould be loſt to the Taſte of
Mankind! But your Generoſity and Benevolence lead you to cultivate and
improve the barren Soil and ſorry Shrubs of your Friends, to the Neglect of
your own rich Fields and more excellent Plantations. You will ſee in the
<hi>Critical Review</hi> a Character of my Fables ſufficient to make me
exceſſively proud, were I not inwardly checked by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how much
they owe to your Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but I ought to be proud of that, and I am ſo.
They do not, however, yet appear <pb n="301" facs="tcp:1173200201:319"/> to be much taken Notice
of; but it is early Days, and my Friends encourage me to hope, that when they
are known, they will not be neglected. I am much pleaſed with the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Honour you have done them, in getting new Head and Tail Pieces executed, and
ſhall be very impatient till I ſee your Liſt of the Subjects.</p>
            <p>As to your Picture, you may be ſure I long to receive it, as it
will at once adorn my Room, and do Honour to myſelf; and I think farther,
that as it will, probably not be much mended by Alteration, the beſt Way will
be to ſend it up without Delay: but this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I leave intirely to your
Determination.</p>
            <p>I have applied to Mr. RICH, in Behalf of Mr. HERON; but he has no
Vacancy in his Houſe, nor Room to employ him: as to Mr. GARRICK, I am not on
ſuch Terms, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as to aſk a Favour of him. I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
alſo to two or three Printers about Mr. W—, but I have not yet been
able to hear of any Thing for him—but I will not <pb n="302" facs="tcp:1173200201:320"/>
give it up: I ſhall be glad to know what Pay he will expect.</p>
            <p>Mr. JENNYNS's Book will be publiſhed in about a
Fortnight—When Mr. PERCY's will be ready is uncertain. All your Letters
are very acceptable to me, as they aſſure me of your Friendſhip;
therefore, pray write to me as often as you can, though you ſhould have
nothing more to ſay, than to give me that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE ſpoken to Mr. L— upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Dedication;
and he agrees with me, that there can be no properer Perſon to procure the
Leave we want than Mr. D—. Suppreſs, therefore, if you pleaſe, my
Letter to Mr. L—, and engage Mr. D— as ſoon as ever you can, to
do his beſt Offices in this Affair. They wait only for the Plates, and my
Lord's Anſwer, before they can order his Arms to be engraved. I blundered, in
regard to L—'s Univerſity; a Blunder ſo much the more unlucky, as
they have no Maſters of Arts at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> he was of
<hi>Aberdeen.</hi> As to the reſt, you will give Mr. D— any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Information my Letter affords you. L— does not expect a Preſent; he
will be perfectly ſatisfied if the Work entitle him to any Degree of Lord
B—'s eſteem: and this Mr. D— may <pb n="304" facs="tcp:1173200201:322"/>
               <hi>ſay,</hi> ſhould his Lordſhip give him an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Perhaps it
need not be mentioned, that L— is a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> unleſs my Lord
ſhould make particular Enquiry. Betwixt Friends, I believe, that having no
Eſtabliſhment, he means here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to aſk ſome little Matter, by Means
of a <hi>Scotch</hi> Lady, who is my Lord's Relation.</p>
            <p>The ſmaller Drawing you encloſed is really a perfect Beauty, and
muſt be executed at all Events when I return it, which I mean to do on
<hi>Saturday</hi>; I ſhall give the Engraver one or two Directions.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I could think as highly of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece. In Truth,
it does not pleaſe me; and what to do, I cannot tell. The Deſigner does not
ſeem to enter into the Spirit of the Story; and the Circumſtance of the
Shield hung upon the Pillar, (a ſingle Pillar of the Temple had been
ſufficient) with the Motto being wholly omitted, throws the whole Streſs
upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the two Figures in the fore Ground. I am ſorry to ſay,
theſe do not anſwer, MAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENAS appears with no Dignity, and HORACE's
Attitude I can't explain. If the Floor had <pb n="305" facs="tcp:1173200201:323"/> been raiſed
one Step where the Patron ſits, and his Perſon tall, or his Chair
embelliſhed a little, &amp;c. and if HORACE were ſhorter, (as his Nature
was) his Attitude no Way vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and his Head down-caſt, it would,
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, have removed ſome of my Objections. But if there were no
Poſſibility of hanging a Shield, &amp;c. on a Piece of a Temple, and ſo
making the Back-Ground important, (as the Deſigner ſurely might have done)
yet there evidently were Means of rendering it more beautiful than it appears
here. HAYMAN cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhould have been the Man! But more of this when I
write on <hi>Saturday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When ſhall I ſee <hi>Baptiſta Porta?</hi> As alſo the
Frontiſpiece only to the Ornaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Temples and Churches?
The Verſes in the <hi>London Magazine</hi> are tolerably well printed, though
my Punctuation is not obſerved. Your Brother was to ſend me alſo the

            <p>YOUR very obliging Letter gave me great Pleaſure; pardon my Delay
in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning my Thanks for that Favour ſooner; I waited to have offered
my ſmall Collection to your View at the ſame Time, which Dr. W—
gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teely excuſed himſelf from the Trouble of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing, profeſſing
he had not Leiſure or critical Skill enough to be of Service to the
Work.—<pb n="307" facs="tcp:1173200201:325"/> When my Brother received my Papers at
<hi>Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham,</hi> he ſhewed them to Dr. H—, who obligingly aſked
Leave to ſhew them to Lord LYTTELTON, which you will imagine was too
agreeable an Offer not to be accepted: the Doctor took them to <hi>Hagley,</hi>
about a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ſince, to be tranſmitted to his Lordſhip by Admiral
SMITH. As ſoon as I receive them, I ſhall immediately do myſelf the
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſending them to the <hi>Leaſowes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Mr. — I find myſelf indebted for the Publication of my
Verſes to Miſs L—, of which, and my Letter to her, ſhe had given
him Copies. I received the firſt Intimation of that Affair from you, but
ſoon after ſaw the ſame incorrect Copy, together with his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and
diſadvantageous Account of me, in two different Magazines. I wrote to him
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subject; he promiſed to retract what he had aſſerted upon
Miſinformation; but his Letters and Behaviour did not appear quite equal to
the amiable Idea I had conceived of him. I am informed by a Friend in Town,
that the ſame Perſon has ſent up a handſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, to be inſerted
in the <hi>Gentleman's Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine,</hi> 
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:1173200201:326"/> for
<hi>February,</hi> which (as if it were intended purely for the Satisfaction of
the Public, and not to do Juſtice to an injured Perſon) he did not
condeſcend to honour me with the Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of.</p>
            <p>I am extremely obliged to you for the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you took in ſending
a correct Copy of thoſe Verſes to the <hi>London Magazine,</hi> which I
ſaw with much Satisfaction. I am alſo to acknowledge the Favour of your
friendly Advice, in Regard to Mr. W—'s Papers; what you ſay on that
Head gives me great Pleaſure, as it intirely coincides with my own
Sentiments: I had no Thoughts of inſerting thoſe Papers in my Collection,
but looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as Things of a private Nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only for the

            <p>When laſt I ſaw that Gentleman, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned my adding thoſe
to the Number I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to print; had I directly objected to it, I had ſome
Reaſon to think it would diſguſt him: he mentioned referring it to you,
which I agreed to with Pleaſure, reſolving to give it a fair Chance, not
doubting but your Judgment <pb n="309" facs="tcp:1173200201:327"/> and Delicacy would
diſapprove of ſuch an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to my little Volume: (that is to be.) I

Obligations I owe you, for your moſt agreeable Letter, and for thoſe
valuable Pieces which accompanied it, and your other Favours. I am
ſenſible, that ſo late a Return to ſuch repeated Marks of Goodneſs,

Hurry of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, during the Winter Seſſions, is the only Excuſe I

writing ſo fully as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and from giving you any Remarks on thoſe
Pearls you was ſo good as to ſend me; the chief Intention of this is to
aſſure you, that I have not been unmindful of your Friend Mr. PERCY,
whoſe Deſign I much approve of, and the more eſpecially, as he has given
you a rejecting Power. Pleaſe to let him know that I have written to my
Friends every where, to pick up all the Ballads they can, while I am

that I can give them (or your <pb n="312" facs="tcp:1173200201:330"/> other Compoſitions) fall
infinitely ſhort of their real Value. The Thoughts are fine, and riſe
naturally from the Subject; the three firſt Stanzas ſhew, indeed, the Hand
of a Maſter, nor do I remember any Thing of Antiquity ſuperior to them for
Elegance and Simplicity of Verſification, Juſtneſs of Sentiment, or
Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Alluſion; nothing can be more happily imagined, than the
Oppoſition of your baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Beauty to the <hi>Paphian</hi> and
<hi>Phrygian</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, while the Choice of Words does Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the
Truth and Beauty of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſeventh is charming, and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet
<hi>Meretricious</hi> conveys ſo ſtriking a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of falſe
Taſte, and is ſo well adapted to the fulſome carving and gilding of
<hi>Chineſe</hi> Baubles, that he muſt be dull indeed who is not ſtruck
by it. It irks me, that I am obliged to defer taking Notice of the other Pieces
till another Time.</p>
            <p>I had lately the Pleaſure of a Viſit from your Friend Mr.
COOKES, whoſe Connection with you I wiſh I had known ſooner. I ſhall
take the firſt Opportunity of ſending you the Anandale Bronze Earth he
mentioned. In the <pb n="313" facs="tcp:1173200201:331"/> mean Time, I have ſent you a little
Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the beſt <hi>Preſton-Pans</hi> Snuff, both toaſted and
untoaſted, in four Bottles, with one Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Highland Sniſhon, and four
Bottle Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, all packed in a Box, along with ſome Things for our worthy
Friend Dr. ROEBUCK, at <hi>Birmingham,</hi> which I hope you will accept of, as
a ſmall Stimulus to our Friendſhip. Pleaſe to let me know, which Sort is
moſt agreeable, that I may ſend you a freſh Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in due Time.</p>
            <p>The good Lord ALEMOOR is juſt now getting the better of a tedious
Fit of the Gout; he returns you his kindeſt Reſpects, and bids me
aſſure you in the ſtrongeſt Manner, of his moſt cordial Eſteem,
that he would be happy to hear from you, but much more to ſee you in this
Corner of the World. Profeſſor SMITH, DOUGLAS, HUME, Dr. ROBERTSON, (now
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of our Univerſity here) and many other of your Friends, deſire
me to return you their Compliments centuplicated. Allow me a ſmall Share in
your Friendſhip, and believe that I am, with the utmoſt Eſteem, dear

            <opener>
               <dateline>

               <salute>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFTER I parted from you at <hi>Broomſgrove,</hi> I arrived very
ſafe and ſpeedily at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> as I hope you did at the
<hi>Leaſowes.</hi> I found Dr. D— in the ſame infirm State of Health,
in which he has lingered for ſome Years paſt; but by keeping up his Spirits
and his Appetite, by great Temperance, and by taking an Airing regularly twice
a Day in his Chaiſe, for ſix or eight Miles at a Time, he has ſo nicely
trimmed his feeble Lamp of Life, that he has prevented it from going out, and
may poſſibly preſerve it burning ſome few Years longer. I employed Mrs.
D— to get me a Pot of Lampreys, which I ſent, Carriage paid, to be left
for you at Mr. HODGETT's: I hope you received them ſafe, and that they proved
good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:1173200201:333"/>On the <hi>Monday</hi> following, I went from
<hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> in the <hi>Birmingham</hi> Stage, to <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
and the next Morning in a Poſt-Chaiſe to <hi>Bath.</hi> I found a Letter at
LEAKE's, which had lain for me eight or ten Days, and the Morning after my
Arrival received another, both ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſſing my Return; I ſet out
again, therefore, in two or three Days for <hi>London,</hi> where, without the
leaſt Fatigue, on <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt I arrived. If I can be of any
Service to the Widow, I ſhall be very glad; but I am afraid the Father is
inclined to take every Advantage which the Law will allow him.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Bath,</hi> I ſaw Mr. MELMOTH, who arrived there with his
Lady the Day before I ſet out. He laments very much his Misfortune in
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you at the <hi>Leaſowes:</hi> but hopes he ſhall have the
Pleaſure of ſeeing you ſome Time or other at <hi>Bath,</hi> where for the
future (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two or three Months in the Winter, which he will dedicate to
his Friends in <hi>London</hi>) he intends to reſide. I ſpent a Day with
Mr. W—, who is meditating an Eſſay on <hi>Simplicity,</hi> of which
he ſhewed me an imperfect Plan, and <pb n="316" facs="tcp:1173200201:334"/> ſome few
Sketches of the Work; he conſiders it in Sentiments, Language, Actions, and
Works of Art, and I fancy will make a good Performance of it. I ſpent alſo
a Day with Mr. GRAVES. Mr. ALLEN has built him a good additional Room, and a
handſome School. He is very earneſt in his Wiſhes, that you would
purſue your Subſcription without farther Delay, and deſires that I will
preſs you to it without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion; I told him, I had ſaid all I
could, and hoped you would proceed. You are in the Meridian of your Fame, he
ſays, and ſhould not let your Sun decline one Moment, before you put your
Work in Agitation.</p>

            <p>THAT the Polite muſt ever pleaſe equally in the Matter and
Manner is what I am not now to learn, having had convincing Proof of it, ever
ſince I have had the pleaſing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being known to Mr. SHENSTONE. To
comprehend in a Nut-Shell a Volume of Ideas, is the happy Talent of a
ſuperior Genius, which thoſe of the more minute, at a Diſtance, admire,
but cannot attain; at leaſt, in our dull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the Difficulties
attending ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt are almoſt inſuperable. It can't have
eſcaped ſo penetrating an Obſervation as Mr. SHENSTONE's, that bad Men
examine every Law with no other Intention than to reap the Benefits, and at the
ſame Time to evade the equal Contributions intended to be levied from all
thoſe, who, as they enjoy the Benefits, ought in Reaſon to contribute their
juſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of the Expences incurred by thoſe, <pb n="318" facs="tcp:1173200201:336"/>
to whom they are indebted for thoſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Againſt ſuch artful and
miſchievous Examiners, it is the Duty of thoſe of our dull Profeſſion
to be upon our Guard, and to protect, by all the Vigilance we are able, the
honeſt and well-meaning from the Artifices and Deſigns of the diſhoneſt
and ungenerous. Few Words, alas! however ſignificcant, are not able to effect
ſuch a Security; and though Dullneſs has been the unfortunate Cauſe of
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a Multiplicity of uſeleſs Tautology in many legal
Tranſactions, yet the neceſſary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, requiſite to protect the
undeſigning from the Dangers of Fraud, from thoſe who are the Peſts of
Society, have unhappily made ſome Repetitions neceſſary in many Caſes,
where a liberal Interpretation, and Elegance of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would point
them out as unneceſſary, and place them in a ridiculous, and, indeed,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Light, in the Judgment of a liberal and generous Obſerver,
unacquainted with the hackneyed Ways of bad and deſigning Men. But, alas!
Such Men there are—ſuch muſt be guarded againſt; and to aid me in
ſuch an <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour, to unite Force, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, at the
ſame Time, Dignity of Expreſſion <pb n="319" facs="tcp:1173200201:337"/> and Elegance,
inſtead of dull Form, I took the Liberty of requeſting the Aid of a
<hi>Pen-Shenſtonian!</hi> I return my very ſincere Thanks for the kind
Aſſiſtance you have been ſo good as to give me; and, as far as the
Cautions I am obliged to obſerve, in order to guard againſt the
Inconveniences I have before hinted at, will permit me, ſhall profit by them;
and as I foreſee many Difficulties that may be likely to ariſe before the
Benefits we wiſh for from the intended Act may be brought to Perfection, I
ſhall take the Liberty you ſo obligingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, of deſiring the
Aſſiſtance and Honour of your Advice, where I have Occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>If I was much ſuſceptible of Vanity, I ſhould have ample Food
for it in indulging the Belief you flatter me with, that a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
from — could give you any Pleaſure or Entertainment: but I am not yet
ſo vain—Plain Facts, and plain Truth and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are all that I can
aim at in a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence; nor can I think, that ſimple Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives,
unaided with any Embelliſhments of Genius, or Livelineſs of Fancy, can give
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to a Mind ſo ſtored with brilliant Ideas <pb n="320" facs="tcp:1173200201:338"/>
as Mr. SHENSTONE's; yet permit me to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, if you honour me with any
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, I ſhall take a very ſincere Pleaſure in obeying them.</p>
            <p>You have much damped the pleaſing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations I had formed of
ſeeing you in — but I yet can't help indulging an Hope, that we yet
may, by ſome happy Event that may deſerve your Attention there, be
gratified with that Pleaſure the enſuing Winter. But wherever you are,
permit me very ſincerely to wiſh you every Felicity, and to join in a
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Aſſurance, with the general Aſſurances which I am deſired
to add from all this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that they are, as I am,</p>
