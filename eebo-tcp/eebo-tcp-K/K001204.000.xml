            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I ſhall, therefore, requeſt your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to repeat the ſubſtance of what I ſubmitted to you on that occaſion, without argument or detail.

I was appointed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Sir John Clavering and Colonel Monſon to a place in the government of Bengal in conjunction with Mr. Haſtings, whom we had never ſeen. We went to India prejudiced,—paſſionately prejudiced in his favour. Almoſt inſtantly after our arrival there we found reaſons to abandon the opinion we had formed of him, and inſtead of ſupporting we attacked him. At that moment at leaſt there could be no perſonal animoſity in us towards a man, who had never perſonally offended us. From the moment we knew him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our oppoſition to him began, and was continued by each o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no man, I believe, will attribute the conduct of my honor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able colleagues to baſe, vindictive motives. This honorabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> an indignity to the venerable names of Clavering and Mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon. In the year 1780, a pacification took place between Mr Haſtings and me; the reaſons and purpoſes of which it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0099006000:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the fatal conſequence which had attended it. I meant that we ſhould ſtand in the ſame relation to each other, as if the duel and the cauſe of it had never happened. But did I tell him, that if I ſurvived, I would renounce the whole plan and principle of my public life; that I would ceaſe to oppoſe his meaſures; that I would deſert the charges, which I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready brought againſt him, or not proſecute him by public impeachment if I could? No, Sir, never; nor am I charged with it. If I had done ſo, I muſt have diſhonoured myſelf for ever, without a motive and without a compenſation. On my return to England, I found that a parliamentary inquiry into the late tranſactions in India was already begun, and I was almoſt immediately ordered to attend one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees employed upon that inquiry. Of thoſe gentlemen who think that I ought not to appear againſt Mr. Haſtings, I beg leave to aſk, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n what manner I ought to have acted? Could I, without treachery to the public, refuſe to give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or information neceſſary for the public ſervice, when it was demanded of me by the authority of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons? or, in fact, was it in my power? Will any man affirm that I had an option? If not, the ſingle queſtion is, in what form and manner did it become me to appear and act as the accuſer of Mr. Haſtings? What, in the character of evidence only? Would that have been a part to which no enmity, no malice could have been imputed. Would it have been honorable in me to ſtand aloof or hide myſelf, while in fact I ſupplied the information, while I furniſhed the materials, and prompted the proſecution? or, am I thought to have acted diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, becauſe I declared myſelf the public reſponſible accuſer of Mr. Haſtings? becauſe I avowed my principles, becauſe I ſtood forward in the charge, and hazarded all thoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of obloquy, retaliation, and revenge, which a public proſecutor muſt encounter, but, which a ſecret ſkulking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer may very eaſily avoid? Theſe are queſtions, I truſt, which anſwer themſelves in the mind of every man of honor. Sir, I do not mean to ſay, that the circumſtance of my hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had a duel with Mr. Haſtings never occurred to me as an objection, which poſſibly might have weight with others, though it appeared to me of no conſequence. It did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly occur to me as a doubt, on which I ought not to truſt entirely to my own judgement. But, the honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom I conſulted, is no more, and for that reaſon I have hitherto been tender of mentioning his name. They, who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0099006000:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knew Sir William Draper, I am ſure will acknowledge that there could not be a ſtricter and more ſcrupulous judge of points of honor than he was. If it were poſſible to produce the opinion he gave me, in approbation of the conduct I have purſued, I ſhould look no farther. But there is an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the ſame effect, which I am able to produce, and which, though negative in its form, I doubt not will be deemed equivalent to any poſitive opinion whatever. I have now been engaged above two years in conſtant intercourſe and connection with twenty gentlemen of the firſt character in this kingdom, and in conſtant converſation with them on the ſubject of this impeachment; I mean particularly the gentlemen who compoſe the preſent Committee, as well as many others. I appeal to their teſtimony, I appeal ſpecially to the honourable General Officer <note n="‖" place="bottom">General Burgoyne.</note> near me, whoſe opinion, I believe, will be allowed to be authority, not only to me, but to the world. Did any of theſe gentlemen ever, directly or indirectly, ſignify to me a doubt about the propriety of my conduct? If they did, I call upon them now to declare it. Is it a thing to be believed, that if they had felt a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in point of honor, on this ſubject, they would never have expreſſed it to me, or that they would have acted with me, if I had known and diſregarded their opinion?</p>
            <p>Thirteen years are now elapſed, ſince I firſt was connected in office with Mr. Haſtings. Six of them were waſted in India in perpetual conteſt with him. Seven years ago, I left him there in poſſeſſion of abſolute power. In all that time no charges have been produced againſt me. Yet, I think it cannot be ſaid that I have been particularly cautious not to provoke hoſtility, or that there is no diſpoſition any where to accuſe me. Surely, Sir, if accuſation is ever to come, it is high time it ſhould appear. If now, or at any other period, I ſhould be obliged to change place with Mr. Haſtings; if hereafter it ſhould be my lot to be accuſed, I ſhall aſſuredly never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his being my proſecutor; for, though by removing a powerful, a well-informed, and, in the ſenſe of the preſent argument, an inveterate accuſer, I might provide for my ſafety, my honor would be loſt. Let thoſe gentlemen, who are truſted with the care of Mr. Haſtings's honor conſider what they are doing.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0099006000:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>I beg of gentlemen to obſerve, that in the preſent queſtion I am nothing but a paſſive inſtrument at the diſpoſal of the Houſe. If they think fit to employ me, I ſhall endeavour to execute their commands with induſtry and vigour; if not, I ſhall conſider it as the happieſt period at which I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my diſmiſſion, and rejoice in the liberty, to which it will reſtore me, of turning my thoughts to ſome other object, of applying my faculties to ſome other occupation. That I ſhould ever be engaged in another ſervice, ſo vexatious, ſo laborious, ſo invidious, and ſo unprofitable, as this has been, I am ſure is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Mr. Francis left the Houſe as ſoon as he finiſhed his ſpeech.</p>
