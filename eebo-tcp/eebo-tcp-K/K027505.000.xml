            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THESE Verſes had been Printed ſoon after they were written, if they had not been deſign'd rather privately to Condole, than publickly to Lament; for it is not pretended that they are in any kind equal to the Subject. But, by ſome Accident, many Copies of 'em have been diſperſed, and one, I was informed, had been ſhewn to a Bookſeller. So that it was high time for me to prevent their appearing with more Faults than their own, which might probably have met with Encreaſe, if not from the Malice or Ignorance, at leaſt from the Careleſsneſs of an under-hand Publiſher.</p>
            <p>I have particularly Reaſon at this time to apprehend the diſingenuous Proceeding of ſome ſuch Perſon, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lately ſeen ſome Verſes Printed, and Intitled <hi>A Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr againſt Love, Reviſed and Corrected by Mr.</hi> Congreve; who does aſſure the Reader he never ſaw or heard of any ſuch Verſes before they were ſo Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> without either the Name of the Author, Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller or Printer, being Publiſh'd after the manner of a Libel.</p>

               <l>There let me fall, there, there lamenting lie,</l>
               <l>There grieving grow to Earth, deſpair, and die.</l>

               <l>Exceſs of Grief her faultring Speech ſuppreſs'd.</l>
               <l>Along the Ground her colder Limbs ſhe laid,</l>
               <l>Where late the Grave was for <hi>Amyntas</hi> made;</l>
               <l>Then from her ſwimming Eyes began to pour,</l>
               <l>Of ſoftly falling Rain a Silver Show'r;</l>
               <l>Her looſely flowing Hair, all radiant bright,</l>
               <l>O'er-ſpread the dewy Graſs like Streams of Light.</l>
               <l>As if the Sun had of his Beams been ſhorn,</l>
               <l>And caſt to Earth the Glories he had worn.</l>

A Sight ſo lovely ſad, ſuch deep Diſtreſs</l>
               <l>No Tongue can tell, no Pencil can expreſs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And now the Winds, which had ſo long been ſtill,</l>

               <l>The Water-Nymphs, who motionleſs remain'd,</l>
               <l>Like Images of Ice, while ſhe complain'd,</l>
               <l>Now loos'd their Streams; as when deſcending Rains</l>
               <l>Roll the ſteep Torrents headlong o'er the Plains.</l>
               <l>The prone Creation, who ſo long had gaz'd,</l>
               <l>Charm'd with her Cries, and at her Griefs amaz'd,</l>
               <l>Began to roar and howl with horrid Yell,</l>
               <l>Diſmal to hear, and terrible to tell;</l>
               <l>Nothing but Groans and Sighs were heard around,</l>
               <l>And Eccho multiply'd each mournful Sound.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When all at once an univerſal Pauſe</l>

               <l>The Balmy Air with fragrant Scents was fill'd,</l>

               <l>Such, if not ſweeter, was the rich Perfume</l>

               <l>Thick as the pearly Drops the Fair had ſhed,</l>
               <l>The blowing Buds advanc'd their Purple Head;</l>
               <l>From ev'ry Tear that fell, a Violet grew,</l>
