            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following productions have already experienced ſo much indulgence from the Public, that in ſending them thus collected into the world, I ſhould feel, perhaps, more of confidence than apprehenſion, were I not perfectly convinced that temporary favour is no deciſive proof of real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
            <p>Whatever the future fate of theſe performances may be, I am aware that it muſt depend upon themſelves alone; and I ſhall not trouble my reader with
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0310600101:9"/>
any vain attempt to enhance their merits, or palliate their defects.</p>
            <p>Yet concerning one claſs of poems in the collection, it may be proper to ſay a few words, as ſome critics have expected to find in them much more than their author intended—I mean the eſſays on different arts. In theſe it was by no means my deſign to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the office of a legiſlator; not only from a juſt diffidence in my own power of framing ſuch laws, but from a perſuaſion that in poetry they ſeldom prove either pleaſing or uſeful.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, I believe, of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dactic poems, that the parts of them which do not pretend to teach, are the moſt productive of pleaſure, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of utility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0310600101:10"/>
Paradoxical as this may appear, I am convinced, that in compoſitions relating to the fine arts it is ſtrictly true. A collection of precepts, tho' expreſſed in the moſt elegant verſe, can never make either a Painter or a Poet; whoſe productions, to uſe the words of a great hiſtorian, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite leſs admiration, if they could be created by the leſſons of a preceptor.</p>
            <p>Rules of art are in general ſo trite or fallacious, that they rather tend to tire and miſlead than to animate and direct.—Let us conſider, for inſtance, the Art of Poetry by Boileau, which is juſtly ſaid to be ſuperior to its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.—If we examine the mere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts contained in this admirable Poem, ſome of them are ſuch as a
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0310600101:11"/>
Poet would certainly be neglected for obſerving, and others only ſuch as muſt occur to every writer of a ſound underſtanding.—They are indeed em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed with all the graces of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and highly-poliſhed expreſſion; yet ſurely the moſt engaging and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful parts of this celebrated work, are its lively images and characters; which, by animating the compoſition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire an enthuſiaſtic eſteem for the art and its profeſſors.</p>
            <p>Concerning the real uſe of rules, opinions have been very different.—Some have even imputed the decline of art to the accumulation of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; while others have thought ſo highly of their power, as to imagine that no one can produce a good Poem,
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0310600101:12"/>
without being acquainted with the Poetics of Ariſtotle; which is, in truth, like imagining that no one can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a parent without peruſing a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of anatomy.</p>
            <p>Tho' I confeſs myſelf inclined to doubt the efficacy of precepts towards forming a great artiſt of any kind, I am far from intending to condemn the poems, that have appeared on a preceptive plan.—Many of theſe are written in a manner ſo ſprightly, and with ſuch an elegant felicity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that if they do not afford to young ſtudents that new and ſolid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which they profeſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, they are at leaſt highly pleaſing; and certainly very ſerviceable to that more numerous claſs of readers, the critics and connoiſſeurs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0310600101:13"/>
It was, however, my wiſh to render my own Poems, on different arts, more <hi>hiſtorical</hi> than <hi>preceptive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My principal deſign was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a general view of the art in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a juſt and animating cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of its moſt eminent profeſſors. There is, I believe, a ſeaſon of life, in which Poems of this nature may be read with the happieſt effect.—The firſt, and perhaps the moſt important ſtep towards forming a great Artiſt in any line, is to inſpire a youth of quick feelings with an enthuſiaſtic paſſion for ſome particular art, and with an ingenuous delight, in the glory of its Heroes.</p>
            <p>Such was the end that I propoſed to myſelf in theſe eſſays; for, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0310600101:14"/>
or inconſtant health, and the love of literary retirement, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me from ſerving the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in ſcenes of active life, I have conſidered it as particularly incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on me to endeavour at leaſt, in my poetical purſuits, to promote the intereſt of ſociety.</p>
            <p>I am aware that ſuch an idea is open to much raillery, as vain and romantic; but Poetry is an art, which conduces ſo little to the private emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument and advantage of thoſe who devote even a life to it, that they ought, I think, to be indulged in ſuch proſpects, however chimerical, as ariſe only from a benevolent vanity.</p>
            <p>In cloſing this Preface, it may be proper to ſay, that the collection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0310600101:15"/>
nothing which has not appeared before, except an Ode to that elegant and inſtructive female author the Counteſs of Genlis, with a few ſhort and occaſional compoſitions, inſerted at the end of the firſt volume.</p>

Her father, filling up the lines with clay, formed a buſt, and hardened it in the fire with the reſt of his earthen ware."</q>

                     <p>Panaeus was the brother of Phidias, the celebrated Sculptor, whom he is ſaid to have aſſiſted in his nobleſt works.

The moſt conſpicuous figures among the perſons engaged were Callimachus, and Miltiades, and a hero called Echetlus: he mentions alſo another hero, who is introduced into the picture, called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon, from whom, he ſays, the field had its name.<bibl>Pauſanias, fol. Lip. 1696. p. 37.</bibl>
                     </p>
                     <p>From Pliny's account of the ſame picture we learn that the heads of the generals were portraits—<q rend="inline">adeo jam colorum uſus percrebuerat, adeoque ars perfecta erat ut in eo Praelio ICONICOS duces pinxiſſe tradatur.</q>

Not only admirable beyond his predeceſſors in his own profeſſion of Painting, but an excellent Architect and Muſician, and of great ſkill as an Anatomiſt. Beſides all theſe talents, he was, according to Vaſari, the beſt extempore rimer of his time.—His Hiſtory and Works are well known.—The ſingular circumſtance of his dying in the arms of Francis the Firſt, king of France, is mentioned by a French poet of the preſent age,

                        </q>
And the particulars of his death are thus curiouſly recorded by Vaſari, who ſpeaks in raptures of his various and exalted talents:</p>

                     <p>Don Diego Velaſquez de Silva, the moſt accompliſhed of the Spaniſh Painters, was born at Seville, 1594, and clos'd his honourable and ſplendid life at Madrid in 1660.—His maſter was Pacheco, a Spaniard, who united the ſiſter arts of Painting and Poetry.—Velaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez was patronized by the famous Olivarez, and had the honour of painting our Charles the Firſt, during his viſit at Madrid: perhaps he contributed not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to form the taſte and paſſion for art, by which that Prince was ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed. The Spaniſh Painter roſe to great honours in his own country, and had, like Rubens, the ſingular fortune to unite the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an Ambaſſador with that of an Artiſt, being ſent on an extraordinary commiſſion, in 1648, to Pope Innocent X.</p>
                     <p>One of his moſt ſtriking hiſtorical pictures, was the expulſion of the Moors from Spain; a noble, national ſubject, which he painted for Philip the Third, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0310600101:91"/>
with three Artiſts of reputation, and obtained the preference.</p>
                     <p>But he is particularly celebrated for the ſpirit and energy of his Portraits; concerning which there are two ſingular ancedotes related by his Spaniſh Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; and the following may poſſibly amuſe the reader:</p>
                     <p>In 1639, he executed a portrait of Don Adrian Pulido Pareja, Commander in chief of an armament appointed to New Spain; and pleaſed himſelf ſo well in the execution, that he affixed his name to the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; a circumſtance not uſual with him. He had painted with pencils of uncommon length, for the ſake of working at a greater diſtance, and with peculiar force; ſo that the picture (ſays my Spaniſh author) when near, is not to be diſtinguiſhed, and at a diſtance, is a miracle. As Velaſquez, after this portrait was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, was at work in the palace, the King, as uſual, went privately to his apartment to ſee him paint; when obſerving the figure of Pareja, and taking it for the real perſon, he exclaimed with ſurprize, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What! are you ſtill here? have you not your diſpatches? and why are you not gone?"</q> But ſoon perceiving his miſtake, he turn'd to Velaſquez (who modeſtly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reality of the deception) and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I proteſt to you it deceived me."</q>—For this ſtory, ſuch as it is, I am indebted to the author whom I have quoted in the preced ng Note. The celebrated Murillo, whoſe pictures are much better known in England than thoſe of his maſter, was a diſciple of Velaſquez.</p>

                     <p>Don Bartolome Eſtevan Murillo was born in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0310600101:92"/>
of Seville, in 1613. His firſt maſter was Juan de Caſtillo; but he ſoon ſettled in Madrid, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Velaſquez, who contributed to his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the moſt generous manner. The Spaniards boaſt that Murillo became a great Painter, without ever travelling out of Spain. He is ſaid to have refuſed the offer of an eſtabliſhment in England from Charles the Second, and to have pleaded his age as an excuſe for not quitting his own country; where he died, and was buried with great marks of honour, in 1685.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who wiſh for more information on the Artiſts of Spain, may be amply gratified by the amuſing work which Mr. Cumberland has lately publiſhed on the Painters of that country:—they will find in it a very ſpirited account of the famous Mengs, who died in the ſervice of the Spaniſh court, at the age of fifty-one, in 1779.—If we could truſt to the praiſes beſtowed on this celebrated Artiſt, by his friend and biographer Azara, we might revere him as the reſtorer of perfect art; but the elegant writer of our country, who has ſurveyed his capital productions with an impartial eye, gives us to underſtand, that they all betray a great poverty of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. Indeed the perſonal hiſtory of Mengs may tend to confirm this idea. He was originally made a painter and a drudge, by the tyranny of a cruel father; and though he applied himſelf intenſely through life to the practice and theory of his art, he ſeems never to have attained that felicity of performance, which can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps belong only to thoſe, who devote themſelves to a favorite art in the happy ardour of unconſtrained af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The profeſſional writings of Mengs will

                     <p>George Vaſari, to whom we are indebted for a moſt valuable hiſtory of Italian Painters, was born at Arezzo in Tuſcany, 1511.—Though the fame of the author ſeems to have eclipſed that of the artiſt, he roſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable eminence as a painter, and has left us a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and entertaining account of himſelf and his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the cloſe of his great work—it is introduced with an apology, in which he ſpeaks of his own talents, and extreme paſſion for his art, in the moſt modeſt and engaging manner.—His generous deſire of doing juſtice to the merit of others, is moſt happily rewarded in the following Elogy, by the great Thuanus:</p>

                     <p>There is no article of taſte, on which different writers have run more warmly into the oppoſite extremes of admiration and contempt, than in eſtimating the Painters of Holland. Thoſe who are enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſublime conceptions of the Roman ſchool, are too apt precipitately to condemn every effort of the Dutch pencil as a contemptible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; while thoſe, who are ſatisfied with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and faithful delineations of nature, find ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection in the very pictures, which are

treated by others with the moſt ſupercilious neglect.—But ſound and impartial judgment ſeems equally to diſclaim this haſty cenſure, and this inordinate praiſe;—and ranking the moſt eminent Dutch artiſts below the great Italian maſters, yet allows them conſiderable and peculiar merit.—A French author ſays, I think not unhappily, of the Dutch painters, that they are <q rend="inline">"dans la peinture, ce que le comique &amp; le plaiſant ſonte dans la poeſie."</q> In deſign their forte is certainly humour, and they have frequently carried it to great perfection.</p>

                     <p>Sir Peter Paul Rubens, who is happily ſtyled by Mr. Walpole, <q rend="inline">"The Popular Painter,"</q> was born at Cologne 1577, and died of the gout at Antwerp 1640. The hiſtory of his life furniſhes a moſt ſtriking incentive to the young painter's ambition.—The many accompliſhments which he poſſeſſed, the infinitude of works which he produced, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and eſteem, the various honours and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fortune which he ſo juſtly acquired, preſent to the mind an animating idea of what may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a happy cultivation of talents in a courſe of conſtant and ſpirited application. Though he viſited the court of Charles the Firſt in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick character of an ambaſſador, it does not appear how long he reſided here;—Mr. Walpole conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures about a year.—His pictures in the ceiling at
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0310600101:97"/>
Whitehall were not painted in England; which perhaps is the reaſon he has been at the pains of finiſhing them ſo neatly, that they will bear the neareſt inſpection; for he muſt have well known how greatly the reputation of any work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on its firſt happy impreſſion on the publick, and concluded his pictures would be viewed by the king and court inſtantly on their arrival, and that the critics would not be candid enough to delay their remarks on them till they were elevated to their intended height. This noble work was falling into decay, from which ſtate it has been lately reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued by that excellent artiſt Mr. Cipriani, to whoſe care it has been moſt judiciouſly committed to be cleaned and repaired.—Rubens received for this work £.3000.</p>

On his firſt viſit to England he received no encouragement from the Court, but Charles, becoming ſoon afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his merit, ſent him an invitation to return.

This honour however has been brought into queſtion—Germany made a ſtrong, but unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effort to rob Holland of the glory which ſhe derives from the firſt invention of Printing: and Painting in oil (it has been ſaid) was known in Italy before the time of John Van Eyck, or John of Bruges, as he is commonly called; to whom that diſcovery is generally aſcribed, about the year 1410.—But Vaſari, in his Life of Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello da Meſſina, relates very particularly the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Van Eyck's invention, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent introduction of the ſecret into Italy. A moſt learned antiquarian and entertaining writer of our own time has ſuppoſed that Van Eyck might poſſibly <q rend="inline">"learn the ſecret of uſing oil in England, and take the honour of the invention to himſelf, as we were then a country little known to the world of arts, nor at leiſure, from the confuſion of the times, to claim the diſcovery of ſuch a ſecret."</q>—

                     <p>Since the preceding part of this Note was written, the reputation both of Van Eyck, and his encomiaſt Vaſari, has been very forcibly attacked in an Eſſay on Oil-painting, by Mr. Raſpe; an Eſſay which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers ſuch a zealous attachment to the arts, and ſuch an active purſuit of knowledge, as do great credit to its ingenious author. But, though I have peruſed it with the attention it deſerves, it does not lead me to retract what I had ſaid; becauſe, after all his reſearches on this ſubject, it appears that although Oil-painting was not abſolutely the invention of Van Eyck, it was yet indebted to him for thoſe improvements which made it of real value to his profeſſion.—The ingenious Fleming ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore to be ſtill entitled to thoſe honours that have been laviſhed on his name, as improvement in ſuch caſes is often more uſeful and more meritorious than invention itſelf, which is frequently the effect of chance, while the former ariſes from well-directed ſtudy.</p>

An ape is introduced applying to a painter, and begging to learn his profeſſion, as Nature he ſays has given him a genius for the mimetic arts.—The painter complies—but his diſciple, after an apprenticeſhip of ten years, bids his maſter adieu, with many humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous execrations againſt the art of Painting.—Other parts of the poem contain many ſenſible and ſerious remarks on the abuſes of the pencil; and as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has given us a portrait of himſelf in his poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal character, I ſhall preſent it to the reader as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of his ſtyle.<q>

Godfrey Kneller, born at Lubec 1646, ſettled in England 1674, was knighted by King William, created a Baronet by George the Firſt, and died 1723.—No Painter was ever more flattered by the Muſes; who gave him credit for talents which he never diſplayed. Dryden ſays, in his enchanting Epiſtle to Kneller:
<q>
                           <l>Thy genius, bounded by the times, like mine,</l>
                           <l>Drudges on petty draughts, nor dares deſign</l>

                        </q>
But the drudgery of the Poet aroſe from the moſt cruel neceſſity; that of the Painter, from avarice, the bane of excellence in every profeſſion!—If Sir Godfrey had any talents for hiſtory, which is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very doubtful, we have, as Mr. Walpole well obſerves, no reaſon to regret that he was confined to portraits, as his pencil has faithfully tranſmitted to us <q rend="inline">"<hi>ſo many ornaments of an illuſtrious age.</hi>"</q>

Fugitive co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring ſeems indeed to be the chief defect among our preſent painters in oil; and it muſt be the moſt ardent wiſh of every lover of art, that ſo great an evil may be effectually remedied. As the Royal Academy is a ſociety of enlightened artiſts, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0310600101:110"/>
for the improvement of every branch of Painting, it may be hoped that they will pay atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this mechanical point, as well as to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler acquirements of art, and employ ſome perſon, who has patience and abilities for ſuch an office, to diſcover, by a courſe of experiments, to what cauſe this important evil is owing. If it be found to ariſe from the adulteration of colours, oils, and varniſhes, might it not be eligible for the Academy to follow the example of another profeſſion, who, where health and life are concerned, obviate the difficulty of getting their articles genuine from the individual trader, by opening a ſhop at the expence of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to prepare and ſell the various ingredients, free from thoſe adulterations which private intereſt might otherwiſe produce?</p>
                     <p>But there may be no juſt ground of complaint againſt the integrity of the colourman, and this failure may perhaps ariſe from the artiſt's mixing his colours, and their vehicles, in improper propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to each other; that is, inſtead of painting with oil properly thickened with colour, uſing oil only fully ſtained with it, to which a proper conſiſtence (or body, as the painters call it) is given by ſtrong gum varniſhes; in ſhort, uſing more vehicle than colour; by which, although moſt brilliant and tranſparent effects may be produced, yet the particles of colour are too much attenuated, and divided from each other, and conſequently leſs able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the deſtructive action of light. If the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0310600101:111"/>
complained of originates from this ſource, the Academy, by a careful courſe of experiments, may be able clearly to aſcertain what preparations of the more delicate colours are moſt durable; what oils and varniſhes will beſt preſerve the original brilliancy of the paint; what are the beſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for this purpoſe in which they can be uſed; and how far glazing (that almoſt irreſiſtible temptation to oil-painters) may or may not be depended on. All theſe points are at preſent ſo far from being known with certainty, that perhaps there are not two Painters, who think perfectly alike on any one of them. The author hopes, that the gentlemen of the pencil will pardon his preſuming to offer a hint on this delicate ſubject, with which he does not pretend to be intimately acquainted. The ideas, which he has thus ventured to addreſs to them, ariſe only from the moſt ardent wiſh, that future ages may have a juſt and adequate ſenſe of the flouriſhing ſtate of Painting in England in the reign of George the Third, and that our preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent artiſts may not be reduced to depend on the uncertain hand of the engraver for the eſteem of poſterity.</p>

and ſhort-lived brilliancy, that they ſink very ſoon into no colour at all. He did not mean to touch on thoſe changes in Painting, where the colours all grow darker, the lights become brown, and the ſhadows one maſs of black. This is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a great evil, and calls aloud for redreſs.

We may juſtly apply to him the compliment which a lively Italian addreſſed to a great man of his own country, but of far inferior expreſſion:<q>

                     <p>While we are delighted with the increaſing ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of theſe annual entertainments, it is but juſt to remember, that we are indebted to the Society of Arts and Sciences for our firſt public exhibition of Paintings. The different ſocieties of artiſts ſoon followed ſo excellent an example; and our rapid and various improvements in this lovely art reflect the higheſt honour on this happy inſtitution. Our exhibitions at once afford both the beſt nurſery for the protection of infant genius, and the nobleſt field for the diſplay of accompliſhed merit: nor do they only adminiſter to the benefit of the artiſt, and the pleaſure of the public: they have ſtill a more exalted tendency; and when national ſubjects are painted with dignity and force, our exhibitions may
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0310600101:114"/>
juſtly be regarded as ſchools of public virtue. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the young ſoldier can never be more warmly animated to the ſervice of his country, than by gazing, with the delighted public, on a ſublime picture of the expiring hero, who died with glory in her defence. But, not to dwell on their power of inſpiring martial enthuſiaſm, our exhibitions may be ſaid to have a happy influence on the manners and morals of thoſe, who fill the different depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of more tranquil life. In ſupport of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, I beg leave to tranſcribe the following judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious remark from an author, who has lately obliged the public with two little volumes of elegant and ſpirited Eſſays. <q rend="inline">"They, whoſe natural feelings have been properly improved by culture, nor have yet become callous by attrition with the world, know from experience, how the heart is mollified, the manners poliſhed, and the temper ſweetened, by a well-directed ſtudy of the arts of imitation. The ſame ſenſibility of artificial excellence, extends it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the perception of natural and moral beauty; and the ſtudent returns from the artiſt's gallery to his ſtation in ſociety, with a breaſt more diſpoſed to feel and to reverberate the endearments of ſocial life, and of reciprocal benevolence."</q>

                     <p>William Hogarth was born in London, 1698, and put apprentice to

an engraver of the moſt ordinary claſs; but his comic talents, which are ſaid to have appeared firſt in the prints to Hudibras, ſoon raiſed him to fame and fortune.—He married a daughter of Sir James Thornhill, and died 1764.—The peculiar merits of his pencil are unqueſtionable. His Analyſis of Beauty has been found more open to diſpute; but however the greater adepts in the ſcience may differ on its principles, it may certainly be called an honourable monument of his genius and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

                     <p>Richardſon has fallen into a miſtake concerning the famous Danaë, and other pictures of Titian, which he ſays (in quoting a letter of Titian's without conſidering its addreſs) were painted for Henry the VIIIth of England; a tyrant, indeed, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous and cruel, but ſtill leſs deteſtable than the ſullen and unnatural Philip the IId of Spain, who filled up the meaſure of his ſuperior guilt by the horrid aſſaſſination of his ſon. Philip, on his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Mary, aſſumed the title of King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and to him Titian addreſſed the letter, which ſpeaks of the pictures in queſtion: the painter frequently mentions his attachment to his unworthy patron.</p>
                     <p>His ſolicitude to enſure his protection and favour, is ſtrongly marked in the following ſhort paſſage of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0310600101:116"/>
a letter which he addreſſed to one of Philip's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. <q rend="inline">"Mando ora la poeſia di Venere e Adone, nella quale V. S. vedrà, quanto ſpirito e amore ſo mettere nell' opere di ſua Maeſtà."</q>

                     <p>How poorly this great artiſt was rewarded for his ill-directed labour, appears very forcibly in a long letter of complaint, which he had ſpirit enough to addreſs to the king, on the many hardſhips he ſuffered in being unable to obtain the payment of the penſion which had been granted to him by the emperor Charles the Vth. <bibl>Raccolta, tom. ii. p. 379.</bibl>

whoſe glory has of late received new luſtre from the pen of Robertſon and the pencil of Weſt. The ſtriking ſcene here alluded to, which preceded the death of Sidney, has not yet, I believe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon canvaſs, but is forcibly deſcribed by the noble and enthuſiaſtic friend of Sidney, the Lord Brooke.—See Biograph. Britan. Art. SIDNEY.</p>
                     <p>The particulars alſo are minutely deſcribed, and with great feeling, in a letter from his uncle Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter to Sir Thomas Heneage, quoted in Collins's Memoirs of the Sidneys. The tide of national ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration flowed very ſtrong in favour of Sidney, when Mr. Walpole, in ſpeaking of Lord Brooke, appeared to check the current; but the merits of Sidney are ſufficient to bear down all oppoſition.—Inſtead of joining the elegant author I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in conſidering Sir Philip Sidney as <q rend="inline">"an aſtoniſhing object of temporary admiration,"</q> I am ſurpriſed that ſo judicious an author ſhould ever queſtion ſo fair a title to univerſal regard. The learning and munificence, the courage and courteſy, of Sidney endeared him to every rank; and he juſtly challenges the laſting affection of his country from the cloſing ſcene of his life, in which heroiſm and humanity are ſo beautifully blended. I never can think this accompliſhed character any ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by his having written a tedious romance (in which however there are many touches of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite beauty and ſpirit) to amuſe a moſt amiable ſiſter, whom he tenderly loved; or by his having
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0310600101:118"/>
threatened an unworthy ſervant of his father's with death in a haſty billet, merely to intimidate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him from the future commiſſion of an infamous breach of truſt, in opening his letters.</p>

                     <p>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet, eldeſt daughter of the celebrated Sir Thomas More. The ſcene which I have propoſed for the ſubject of a picture, is taken from the following paſſage in Ballard:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline">"After Sir Thomas More was beheaded, ſhe took care for the burial of his body in the chapel of St. Peter's ad Vincula, within the precincts of the Tower; and afterwards ſhe procured his corpſe to be removed, and buried in the chancel of the church at Chelſea, as Sir Thomas More, in his life-time, had appointed. His head having remained about fourteen days upon London Bridge, and being to be caſt into the Thames to make room for others, ſhe bought it. For this ſhe was ſummoned before the council, as the ſame author relates, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with the greateſt firmneſs, juſtifying her conduct upon principles of humanity and filial piety. She was, however, impriſoned, but ſoon releaſed; and dying nine years after her father, at the age of thirty-ſix, was buried at St. Dunſtan's, in Canterbury. The head of her father, which ſhe had preſerved, with religious veneration, in a box of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0310600101:119"/>
lead, was, at her particular requeſt, committed with her to the grave. It was ſeen ſtanding on her coffin in the year 1715, when the vault of the Roper (her huſband's family) was opened."</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>The character of this amiable woman is happily drawn both by Addiſon and Walpole.—She mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, at the age of twenty, William Roper, Eſquire, of Kent, to the infinite ſatisfaction of her father; for ſhe ſeems to have been the deareſt object of his parental affection, which is very ſtrongly marked in his letters addreſſed to her. She was indeed moſt eminently diſtinguiſhed by her learning, in an age when the graces of the mind were regarded as an eſſential article in female education: but the beauty and force of her filial piety reflects a ſtill ſuperior luſtre on this accompliſhed woman.—There is more than one paſſage in her life, which would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh an admirable ſubject for the pencil. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviw with her father, on his return to the Tower, is mentioned as ſuch by Mr. Walpole.</p>

                     <p>In recommending this ſubject to the pencil, it may be proper to obſerve, that it is not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult, but even attended with danger, if we credit the following curious anecdote, in a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writer of great reputation:—<q rend="inline">"Spinello, fameux Peintre Toſcan, ayant peint la chute des anges rebelles, donna des traits ſi terribles à Lucifer, qu'il en fut lui-meme ſaiſi d'horreur, &amp; tout le reſte de ſa vie il crut voir continuellement ce Demon lui repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher de l'avoir repreſenté ſous une figure ſi hidieuſe.</q>

               <l>AN Engliſh Sparrow, pert and free,</l>

               <l>Hearing the Roman Eagle's near,</l>

                  <l>"They ſlight the clear dictates of Reaſon and Truth;</l>
                  <l>"They worſhip Ambition, to Pleaſure they bend,</l>

                  <l>"And hence their vain hopes are eternally croſt,</l>
                  <l>"Their life in a tempeſt of wiſhes is loſt;</l>
                  <l>"Still deſtin'd to toil, and of toil to repent,</l>
                  <l>"For neglect of juſt vows to the Goddeſs Content;</l>
                  <l>"That Goddeſs from whom all felicity flows,</l>
                  <l>"Who unites every good in the gift ſhe beſtows;</l>
                  <l>"So free of her bounty to all who confeſs it,</l>
                  <l>"To ſolicit her ſmile is almoſt to poſſeſs it."</l>
                  <l>When I heard this fine ſpeech, my fond paſſion was rais'd,</l>
                  <l>And I ſet forth in queſt of the Being ſo prais'd;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0310600101:200"/>
At the manſion of Grandeur my ſearch I begin,</l>
                  <l>And aſk if the Goddeſs Content is within:</l>
                  <l>But Pride, who as centinel guarded the door,</l>
                  <l>Said bluntly he ne'er heard her title before;</l>
                  <l>He told me I wanted a poor ruſtic ſlut,</l>
                  <l>And bade me go look in ſome little thatch'd hut.</l>
                  <l>I march'd to the Villager's lowly abode,</l>
                  <l>'Twas a ſnug pretty cottage, and ſtood near the road:</l>
                  <l>And here a good woman, poſſeſſing, tho' humble,</l>
                  <l>A face that could frown, and a tongue that would grumble,</l>
                  <l>Said—the perſon I aſk'd for had lodg'd in her cot,</l>
                  <l>But, alas! ſuch good luck was no longer her lot;</l>
                  <l>For ſhe quitted her roof, where ſhe oft had repos'd,</l>
                  <l>When yon great houſe was built, and the common inclos'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I conceiv'd, as I now bade the village farewell,</l>
                  <l>With the mild ſons of Science this Goddeſs muſt dwell;</l>
                  <l>But thoſe, where I ſought ſome obliging inſtructor,</l>
                  <l>Were ſquabbling about an electric conductor.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0310600101:201"/>
Some cry'd up the point; ſome commended the ball;</l>
                  <l>The ſoft breath of Science was turn'd to a ſquall:</l>
                  <l>The Sages no mental conductor could find</l>
                  <l>To draw off the flame that now flaſh'd on their mind.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>In haſte I exclaim'd, to the Learned adieu!</l>
                  <l>For e'en Science offends, when ſhe talks like a ſhrew.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Having wander'd ſo wide of the object I ſought,</l>
                  <l>I was now led to think, and rejoic'd at the thought,</l>
                  <l>This Goddeſs (herſelf for her charms ſo renown'd)</l>
                  <l>With the daughters of Beauty muſt ſurely be found:</l>
                  <l>With this hope I approach'd (unperceiv'd by them all)</l>
                  <l>Three lovely young girls juſt array'd for the ball;</l>
                  <l>In each, whoſe bright eyes on a mirror were bent,</l>
                  <l>I thought I diſcover'd a ſpark of Content;</l>
                  <l>But watching them more, in their beautiful faces,</l>
                  <l>Of the goddeſs I ſought I no more ſaw the traces;</l>
                  <l>For as they ſurvey'd, with a critical glance,</l>
                  <l>The elegant MONTAGU move in the dance,</l>
                  <l>In her exquiſite figure ſuch graces were ſhewn,</l>
                  <l>That viewing her charms they diſtruſted their own.</l>

Thou gentleſt of nymphs! while thy triumphs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</l>
                  <l>Unconſcious of beauty, ſo fatal to peace!</l>
                  <l>Tho' the ſparks of Content in one ſex thou may'ſt ſmother,</l>
                  <l>Bright Ecſtaſy's flame thou wilt raiſe in the other.</l>
                  <l>If in boſom parental Content could reſide,</l>
                  <l>The heart of thy parent this treaſure muſt hide;</l>
                  <l>But, alas! 'tis a truth which all parents lament,</l>
                  <l>Their tender anxiety ſtifles Content.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>O tell me, while vainly to find thee I pant,</l>
                  <l>Dear latent Divinity! where is thy haunt?</l>

                  <l>With thy Myrtle, kind MILLER! O let me be crown'd,</l>
                  <l>Then my ſearch is repaid, and the Goddeſs is found:</l>
                  <l>Nay, if to another your wreath you aſſign,</l>
                  <l>And give it to verſe far ſuperior to mine,</l>
                  <l>My ſearch's dear object I ſtill muſt attain,</l>
                  <l>And the proof of this wonder's exceedingly plain,</l>

                  <l>My claim to this bleſſing thus made very clear,</l>
                  <l>If I've nothing to hope, I have nothing to fear;</l>
                  <l>For MILLER can pleaſe while the mind ſhe amuſes,</l>
                  <l>Both when ſhe beſtows, and e'en when ſhe refuſes;</l>
                  <l>In truth I ſuſpect, from her ſingular aim,</l>
                  <l>The Goddeſs I ſeek is conceal'd by her name:</l>
                  <l>She herſelf is Content, and her houſe is the fane,</l>
