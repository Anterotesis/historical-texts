            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM, LORD MARQUISS Of HARTINGTON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>EVery Body is now ſo full of Buſineſs, that things of this kind, which are generally taken for the Entertainment of leiſure Hours only, look like Impertinence and Interruption. I am ſure it is a Reaſon why I ought to beg your Lordſhip's Pardon, for troubling you with this Tragedy; Not but that Poetry has always been, and will ſtill be the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of all wiſe Men, that have any Delicacy in their Knowledge; Yet at ſo Critical a Juncture as this is, I muſt confeſs I think your Lordſhip ought to give intirely into thoſe Publick Affairs, which at this time ſeem to Demand you. It is that happy Turn which your Lordſhip has to Buſineſs, that right Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Country's Intereſt, and that conſtant Zeal to purſue it, that juſt Thinking, that ſtrong and per
<pb facs="tcp:1114700100:4"/>
ſuaſive Elocution, that firm and generous Reſolution, which upon all Occaſions you have ſhewn in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and to add, that which is the crowning good Quality, your Lordſhip's continual Adherence and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken Loyalty to His preſent Majeſty, which make you at this time ſo neceſſary to the Publick. I muſt confeſs, (tho' there is no part in your Lordſhip's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but what the World ſhould be fond of) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help Diſtinguiſhing the laſt Inſtance very particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: It is doing (methinks) ſuch a Juſtice to Goodneſs, to Greatneſs, and to Right Reaſon, that Poſterity will believe there could be no Man of good Senſe, but what muſt have agreed with your Lordſhip in it. When the next Age ſhall Read the Hiſtory of this, What Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe can they make for thoſe who did not Admire a Prince whoſe Life has been a Series of good Offices done to Mankind? When they ſhall reckon up his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours from the Battle of <hi>Seneff,</hi> to ſome Glorious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhall be his Laſt, (and which I therefore hope is very far remov'd from the Preſent Time?) Will they ever believe that he could have been too well lov'd, or too faithfully ſerv'd and defended? The Great Things which he did before we had that immediate Intereſt in him, which we now happily have, is a noble and juſt Subject for Panegyrick; but as Benefits done to Others, can never touch us ſo ſenſibly as thoſe we receive our ſelves, tho' the Actions may be equally great; ſo, methinks, I can hardly have patience to run back to his having ſav'd his own Country, when I conſider he has ſince done the ſame for Us; Let that be ſufficient to Us, for all we can ſay of him or do for him. What Dangers and
<pb facs="tcp:1114700100:5"/>
Difficulties has he not ſtruggled through, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Safety of theſe Kingdoms? 'Tis a common Praiſe, and what every one ſpeaks, to ſay, He has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expos'd his Life for his People; But there are ſome things more particular in his Character, ſome things rarely found amongſt the Policies of Princes; a Zeal for Religion, moderated by Reaſon, without the Rage and Fire of Perſecution; a charitable Compaſſion for thoſe who cannot be convinc'd, and an unalterable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in thoſe Principles of whoſe Truth he is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd; a deſire of War for the ſake of Peace; and of Peace for the Good and Honour of his Subjects equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his own; a pious Care for compoſing Factions, tho' to foment them might make him Arbitrary; and a generous Ambition that only aims at Pow'r, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to do good to all the reſt of the World. I might add here, that Inviolable and Religious Obſervance of his Royal Word, which the beſt part of the Pow'rs of <hi>Europe,</hi> have ſo frequently and ſo happily, for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, depended upon in the greateſt Emergencies. But as this Virtue is generally reckon'd as no more than that common Honeſty, which the meaneſt Man would bluſh to be without, ſo it can hardly claim a Place amongſt the more particular Excellencies of a Great Prince. It were to be wiſh'd, indeed, that the World were honeſt to ſuch a degree, and that there were not that ſcandalous defect of common Morality. Certainly nothing can be more ſhocking to Humanity, to the Peace and Order of the World; nothing can approach nearer to that Savage ſtate of Nature, in which every Man is to eat
<pb facs="tcp:1114700100:6"/>
his fellow if he can maſter him, than an avow'd Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of breaking thro' all the moſt ſolemn Engagements of publick Faith. 'Tis ſomething that brands a Man with an Infamy, which nothing can extenuate or wipe out; he may proteſt and pretend to explain his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the World has generally too much indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Affront, to bear it at that eaſie rate. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Secretaries of State, may diſplay their own Parts in Memorials, with as much Pomp and Flouriſh as they pleaſe: I fancy the common anſwer upon ſuch Occaſions will always be, You have deceiv'd us groſly, and we neither can nor will truſt you any more. When this Vice comes amongſt Men of the firſt Rank, it is the more ſhocking, and I could wiſh there were none ſuch, to whoſe charge it might be laid.</p>
            <p>Some People (who do me a very great Honour in it) have fancy'd, that in the Perſon of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> I have alluded to the greateſt Character of the preſent Age, I don't know, whether I ought not to apprehend a great deal of Danger from avowing a Deſign like that. It may be a Task indeed worthy the greateſt Genius, which this, or any other Time has produc'd: But therefore I ought not to ſtand the ſhock of a Parallel, leaſt it ſhould be ſeen, to my Diſadvantage, how far the <hi>Hero</hi> has <hi>tranſcended the Poet's Thought.</hi> There are many Features, 'tis true, in that Great Man's Life, not unlike His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: His Courage, his Piety, his Moderation, his Juſtice, and his Fatherly Love of his People, but above all, his Hate of Tyranny and Oppreſſion, and his zea lous Care for the Common Good of Mankind, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

large Reſemblance of Him: Several Incidents are alike in their Stories; and there wants nothing to his Majeſty but ſuch a deciding Victory, as that by which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> gave Peace to the World. That is yet to come: But I hope we may reaſonably expect it from the unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the preſent Parliament, and ſo formidable a Force as that Unanimity will give Life and Vigour to.</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhip can find any thing in this Poem like a Prince, who is ſo juſtly the Object of your Lordſhip's, and indeed of the World's Veneration, I perſuade my ſelf it will prevail with you to forgive every thing elſe that you find amiſs. You will excuſe the Faults in Writing, for the goodneſs of the Intention. I hope too, your Lordſhip will not be diſpleas'd, that I take this opportunity of renewing the Honour which I formerly had, to be known to your Lordſhip, and which gives me at once the Pleaſure of expreſſing thoſe Juſt and Dutiful Sentiments I have for his Majeſty, and that ſtrong Inclination which I have always had to be thought,</p>
