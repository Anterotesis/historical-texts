            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE this moment receiv'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of yours of the 8th inſtant; and will make you a true excuſe, (tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no very good one) that I defer'd the troubling you with a letter, when I ſent back your Papers, in hopes of ſeeing you at <hi>Binfield</hi> before this time. If I had met with any fault in your performance, I ſhould freely now (as I have done too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly in converſation with you) tell
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0096900402:3"/>
you my opinion; which I have frequently ventur'd to give you, rather in compliance with your deſires than that I could think it reaſonable. For I am not yet ſatisfied upon what grounds I can pretend to judge of Poetry, who never have been practic'd in the Art. There may poſſibly be ſome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py genius's, who may judge of ſome of the natural beauties of a Poem, as a man may of the proportions of a building, without having read <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> or knowing any thing of the rules of architecture: But this, tho' it may ſometimes be in the right, muſt be ſubject to many miſtakes, and is certainly but a ſuperficial knowledge; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring into the art, the methods, and the particular excellencies of the whole compoſure, in all the parts of it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides my want of skill I have another reaſon why I ought to ſuſpect my ſelf, by reaſon of the great affection I have for you, which might give too much biaſs, to be kind to every thing that comes from you; but after all, I muſt ſay (and I do it with an old-faſhion'd ſincerity) that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely approve of your Tranſlation of thoſe Pieces of <hi>Homer,</hi> both as to the verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the true ſenſe that ſhines thro' the whole; nay I am confirmed in my former application to you, and give me leave to renew it upon this occaſion, that you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0096900402:4"/>
wou'd proceed in tranſlating that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Poet, to make him ſpeak good <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> to dreſs his admirable characters in your proper, ſignificant, and expreſſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and to make his works as uſeful and inſtructive to this degenerate age, as he was to our friend <hi>Horace,</hi> when he read him at <hi>Praeneſte, Qui, quid ſit pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</hi> &amp;c. I break off with that <hi>quid non?</hi> with which I confeſs I am charm'd.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole matter I intreat you to ſend this preſently to be added to the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanies, and I hope it will come time enough for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing to ſay of my Nephew <hi>B.</hi>'s obſervations, for he ſent them to me ſo late, that I had not time to conſider them; I dare ſay he endeavour'd very faithfully (tho' he told me very haſtily) to execute your commands.</p>
                  <p>All I can add is, that if your exceſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty ſhou'd hinder you from publiſhing this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> I ſhall only be ſorry that I have no more credit with you, to perſuade you to oblige the publick, and very particularly, dear Sir,</p>

                  <p>I Send you <hi>Dennis</hi>'s remarks on the <note n="*" place="bottom">On Criticiſm.</note>
                     <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> which equally abound in juſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms and fine Railleries: The few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in my hand in the margins, are what a mornings leiſure permitted me to make, purely for your peruſal. For I am of opinion that ſuch a Critic as you will find him by the latter part of his book, is but one way to be properly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, and that way I wou'd not take after what he informs me in his preface, that he is at this time perſecuted by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. This I knew not before; if I had, his name had been ſpar'd in the Eſſay, for that only reaſon. I can't conceive what ground he has for ſo exceſſive a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; nor imagine how thoſe <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <q>
                           <l>But <hi>Appius</hi> reddens at each word you ſpeak,</l>
                           <l>And ſtares tremendous with a threatning eye,</l>
                           <l>Like ſome fierce Tyrant in old Tapeſtry.</l>
                        </q>
                     </note> three lines can be call'd a reflection on his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which only deſcribe him ſubject a little to Anger on ſome occaſions. I have heard of combatants ſo very furious, as to fall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0096900402:6"/>
down themſelves with that very blow which they deſign'd to lay heavy on their anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts. But if Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s rage proceeds only from a zeal to diſcourage young and unexperienc'd writers from ſcribling, he ſhou'd frighten us with his Verſe not Proſe: for I have often known, that when all the precepts in the world would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a ſinner, ſome very ſad example has done the buſineſs<note n="*" place="bottom">This Thought we find afterwards put into Verſe in the <hi>Dunciad, Book</hi> 1.</note>. Yet to give this man his due, he has objected to one or two lines with reaſon, and I will alter 'em in eaſe of another edition; I will make my enemy do me a kindneſs where he meant an injury, and ſo ſerve inſtead of a friend. What he obſerves at the bottom of page 20th of his reflections, was objected to by your ſelf, and had been mended but for the haſte of the preſs: 'Tis right <hi>Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> and I confeſs it what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> call a <hi>Bull</hi> in the expreſſion, tho' the ſenſe be manifeſt enough: Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Bulls are ſeldom in the expreſſion, they are always in the ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall certainly never make the leaſt reply to him, not only becauſe you adviſe me, but becauſe I have ever been of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that if a book can't anſwer for itſelf
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0096900402:7"/>
to the publick, 'tis to no ſort of purpoſe for its author to do it. If I am wrong in any ſentiment of that Eſſay, I proteſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, I don't deſire all the world ſhould be deceiv'd (which wou'd be of very ill conſequence) meerly that I my ſelf may be thought right, (which is of very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence). I'd be the firſt to recant, for the benefit of others, and the glory of my ſelf; for (as I take it) when a man owns himſelf to have been in an error, he does but tell you in other words, that he is wiſer than he was. But I have had an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the publiſhing that book of <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>_…</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi>'s which otherwiſe I ſhould never have known: It has been the occaſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me friends, and open abetters, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral gentlemen of known ſenſe and wit; and of proving to me what I have till now doubted, that my writings are taken ſome notice of by the world in general, or I ſhould never be attack'd thus in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. I have read that 'twas a cuſtom among the <hi>Romans,</hi> while a General rode in triumph, to have common ſoldiers in the ſtreets that rail'd at him and reproach'd him; to put him in mind, that tho' his ſervices were in the main approved and rewarded, yet he had faults enough to keep him humble.</p>

                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0096900402:8"/>
You will ſee by this, that whoever ſets up for wit in theſe days ought to have the conſtancy of a primitive chriſtian, and be prepar'd to ſuffer martyrdom in the cauſe of it. But ſure this is the firſt time that a Wit was attack'd for his <hi>Religion,</hi> as you'll find I am moſt zealouſly in this treatiſe: and you know Sir, what alarms I have had from the <note n="*" place="bottom">See the enſuing Letters.</note> oppoſite ſide on this account. Have I not reaſon to cry out with the poor fellow in <hi>Virgil,</hi>

                  <p>The manner in which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> takes to pieces ſeveral particular lines, detach'd from their natural places, may ſhew how eaſy it is to a caviller to give a new ſenſe, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0096900402:9"/>
a new nonſence to any thing. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his conſtructions are not more wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the genuine meaning, than theirs who objected to the heterodox parts, as they call'd 'em.</p>
                  <p>Our friend the <hi>Abbè</hi> is not of that ſort, who with the utmoſt candour and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, has modeſtly told me what others thought, and ſhewn himſelf one (as he very well expreſſes it) rather of a <hi>Number</hi> than a <hi>Party.</hi> The only difference between us in relation to the Monks, is, that he thinks moſt ſorts of learning flouriſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 'em, and I am of opinion that only ſome ſort of learning was barely kept alive by 'em: he believes, that in the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and obvious ſenſe, that line <hi>(A ſecond deluge Learning over-run)</hi> will be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Learning in general; and I fancy 'twill be underſtood only (as 'tis meant) of polite Learning, Criticiſm, Poetry, &amp;c. which is the only learning concern'd in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Eſſay. It is true, that the <hi>Monks</hi> did preſerve what learning there was, about <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth's time; but thoſe who ſucceeded fell into the depth of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, or at leaſt ſtood at a ſtay while others roſe from thence, inſomuch that even <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Reuchlin</hi> could hardly laugh them out of it. I am highly oblig'd to the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be</hi>'s zeal in my commendation, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0096900402:10"/>
in not concealing what he thinks my error. And his teſtifying ſome eſteem for the book, juſt at a time when his brethren rais'd a clamour againſt it, is an inſtance of great generoſity and candor, which I ſhall ever acknowledge.</p>

                  <p>IN your laſt you inform'd me of the miſtaken zeal of ſome people, who ſeem to make it no leſs their buſineſs to perſuade men they are erroneous, than Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do that they are ſick; only that they may magnify their own cure, and triumph over an imaginary diſtemper. The Simile objected to in my Eſſay,

                        <l>(Thus wit, like faith, by each man is apply'd</l>
                        <l>To one ſmall Sect, and all are damn'd beſide.)</l>
                     </q>
plainly concludes at this ſecond line, where ſtands a full ſtop: and what follows <hi>(Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſeek,</hi> &amp;c.) ſpeaks only of <hi>Wit,</hi> (which is meant by <hi>that bleſſing,</hi> and <hi>that ſun)</hi> for how can the ſun of <hi>faith</hi> be ſaid
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0096900402:11"/>
to <hi>ſublime the ſouthern wits,</hi> and to <hi>ripen the genius's of northern climates?</hi> I fear theſe gentlemen underſtand grammar as little as they do criticiſm; and perhaps out of good nature to the Monks, are willing to take from 'em the cenſure of ignorance, and to have it to themſelves. The word <hi>They</hi> refers (as I am ſure I meant, and as I thought every one muſt have known) to thoſe critics there ſpoken of, who are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to ſome particular ſett of writers, to the prejudice of all others. And the very ſimile it ſelf, if twice read, may convince them, that the cenſure here of damning, lies not on our Church at all, unleſs they call our Church <hi>one ſmall Sect:</hi> and the cautious words, <hi>(by each man)</hi> manifeſtly ſhow it a general reflection on all ſuch (whoever they are) who entertain thoſe narrow and limited notions of the mercy of the Almighty; which the Reform'd mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Presbyterians are as guilty of as any people living.</p>
                  <p>Yet after all, I promiſe you Sir, if the alteration of a word or two will gratify any man of ſound faith tho' weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will (tho' it were from no other principle than that of common good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) comply with it. And if you pleaſe but to particularize the ſpot where their objection lies, (for it is in a very narrow
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0096900402:12"/>
compaſs) that ſtumbling-block tho' it be but a little pebble, ſhall be removed out of their way. If the heat of theſe good diſputants (who I am afraid being bred up to wrangle in the ſchools, cannot get rid of the humor all their lives) ſhou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo far as to perſonal reflections upon me, I aſſure you notwithſtanding I will do, or ſay nothing, however provok'd (for ſome people can no more provoke than oblige) that is unbecoming the character of a true Catholick. I will ſet before me the example of that great man, and great Saint <hi>Eraſmus;</hi> who in the midſt of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny proceeded with all the calmneſs of innocence, and the unrevenging ſpirit of primitive chriſtianity. However I wou'd adviſe them to ſuffer the mention of <hi>him</hi> to paſs unregarded, leſt I ſhou'd be forc'd to do that for his reputation which I wou'd never do for my own; I mean, to vindicate ſo great a light of our Church from the malice of paſt times, and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the preſent, in a language which may extend farther than that in which the Trifle about Criticiſm is written. I wiſh theſe gentlemen wou'd be contented with finding fault with me only, who will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to 'em right or wrong, as far as I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am concern'd; I have a greater regard to the quiet of mankind than to diſturb it

                  <p>THE concern which you more than ſeem to be affected with for my reputation, by the ſeveral accounts you have ſo obligingly given of what reports and cenſures the holy Vandals have thought fit to paſs upon me, makes me deſirous of telling ſo good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter; and of ſetting before you in a clear light the true ſtate of it.</p>
                  <p>I have ever believ'd the beſt piece of ſervice one cou'd do to our religion, was openly to expreſs our deteſtation and ſcorn of all thoſe mean artifices and <hi>Piae fraudes,</hi> which it ſtands ſo little in need of, and which have laid it under ſo great a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal among its enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0096900402:14"/>
Nothing has been ſo much a ſcarecrow to them, as that too peremptory and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly-uncharitable aſſertion of an utter <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> to all but our ſelves; <hi>invincible</hi> ignorance excepted, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome people define under ſo great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations and with ſuch excluſions, that it ſeems as if that word were rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented as a ſalvo, or expedient, not to be thought too bold with the thunder-bolts of God (which are hurl'd about ſo freely on almoſt all mankind by the hands of eccleſiaſticks) than as a real exception to almoſt-univerſal damnation. For beſides the ſmall number of the truly faithful in our Church, we muſt again ſubdivide; the <hi>Janſeniſt</hi> is damn'd by the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> by the <hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> the <hi>Scotiſt</hi> by the <hi>Thomiſt,</hi> and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p>There may be Errors I grant, but I can't think 'em of ſuch conſequence as to deſtroy utterly the charity of mankind; the very greateſt bond in which we are ingag'd by God to one another. Therefore I own to you, I was glad of any opportnnity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my diſlike of ſo ſhocking a ſentiment as thoſe of the religion I profeſs are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly charg'd with; and I hop'd, a ſlight inſinuation, introduc'd ſo eaſily by a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ſimilitude only, cou'd never have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven offence; but on the contrary muſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0096900402:15"/>
needs have done good; in a nation and time, wherein we are the ſmaller party, and conſequently moſt miſrepreſented, and moſt in need of vindication.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame reaſon, I took occaſion to mention the <hi>Superſtition</hi> of ſome ages after the ſubverſion of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which is too manifeſt a truth to be deny'd, and does in no ſort reflect upon the preſent profeſſors of our faith who are free from it. Our ſilence in theſe points may with ſome reaſon make our adverſaries think we allow and perſiſt in thoſe biggotries; which yet in reality all good and ſenſible Men deſpiſe, tho' they are perſuaded not to ſpeak againſt 'em; I can't tell why, ſince now, 'tis no way the intereſt even of the worſt of our Prieſthood (as it might have been then) to have them ſmother'd in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: For as the oppoſite Sects are now prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our church from being ſlander'd; 'tis our buſineſs now to ſhow it is ſlander'd unjuſtly, and to vindicate our ſelves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with. This can't ſo well be brought about with ſerious faces; we muſt laugh with them at what deſerves it; and then we need not doubt of being clear'd, ev'n in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>

As to particulars: you cannot but have obſerv'd that at firſt the whole objection againſt the ſimile of wit and faith lay to the word <hi>They</hi>: When that was beyond contradiction removed (the very Grammar ſerving to confute 'em) then the objection lies againſt the <hi>Simile itſelf;</hi> or if that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile will not be objected to (ſenſe and common reaſon being indeed a little ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and not apt to give way to every body) next the mention of <hi>Superſtition</hi> muſt become a crime (as if <hi>Religion</hi> and ſhe were ſiſters, or that ſcandal upon the family of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſay a word againſt the Devil's baſtard.) Afterwards, more miſchief is diſcover'd in a place that ſeem'd innocent at firſt, the two lines about <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,</hi> at the bottom of page 24. An or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man would imagine the author plainly declar'd againſt thoſe ſchiſmatics, for quitting the true faith out of contempt of the underſtanding of ſome ſew of its believers: But theſe believers are call'd <hi>Dull,</hi> and becauſe I ſay that <hi>thoſe ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics</hi> think <hi>ſome</hi> believers <hi>dull,</hi> therefore theſe charitable interpreters of my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will have it, that <hi>I</hi> think <hi>all</hi> believers dull. I was telling lately Mr. <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> theſe objections: who aſſur'd me I had ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which a Catholick need to diſown,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0096900402:17"/>
and I have cauſe to know that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's fault (if he has any) is not want of zeal: He put a notion into my head which I confeſs I can't but perfectly acquieſce in; that when a ſett of people are piqu'd at any truth which they think to their own diſadvantage, their method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on the truth-ſpeaker is to attack his reputation a By-way, and not openly to object to the place they are really gall'd by: What theſe therefore (in his opinion) are in earneſt angry at, is, that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> whom their tribe oppreſs'd and perſecuted ſhou'd be vindicated after an age of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy by one of their own people, willing to utter an honeſt truth in behalf of the dead, whom no man ſure will flatter, and to whom few will do juſtice. Others, you know were as angry that I mention'd Mr. <hi>Walſh</hi> with honour; who as he never refus'd to any one of merit of any party the praiſe due to him, ſo honeſtly deſerv'd it from all others, tho' of ever ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent intereſts or ſentiments. May I be ever guilty of this ſort of liberty, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of principle! which gives us the hardineſs of ſpeaking well of thoſe whom envy oppreſſes ev'n after death. As I wou'd always ſpeak well of my living friends when they are abſent, nay becauſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0096900402:18"/>
they are abſent; ſo would I much more of the dead, in that eternal abſence; and the rather becauſe I expect no thanks for it.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, you ſee I do in my conſcience perſiſt in what I have written; yet in my friendſhip I will recant and alter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you pleaſe, in caſe of a ſecond edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which I think the book will not ſo ſoon arrive at, for <hi>Tonſon</hi>'s printer told me he drew off a thouſand copies in this firſt impreſſion, and I fancy a treatiſe of this nature, which not one gentleman in three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore even of a liberal education can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, can hardly exceed the vent of that number.)

                  <p>YOU have oblig'd me with a very kind letter, by which I find you ſhift the ſcene of your life from the town to the country, and enjoy that mix'd ſtate which wiſe men both delight in, and are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd for. Methinks the Moraliſts and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have generally run too much into extremes in commending intirely either ſolitude, or publick life. In the former, men for the moſt part grow uſeleſs by too much reſt, and in the latter are deſtroy'd by too much precipitation; as waters lying ſtill, putrify and are good for nothing, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0096900402:27"/>
running violently on do but the more miſchief in their paſſage to others, and are ſwallow'd up and loſt the ſooner themſelves. Thoſe indeed who can be uſeful to all ſtates, ſhould be like gentle ſtreams, that not only glide thro' lonely valleys and foreſts amidſt the flocks and the ſhepherds, but viſit populous towns in their courſe, and are at once of ornament and ſervice to them. But there are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſort of people who ſeem deſign'd for ſolitude, ſuch I mean as have more to hide than to ſhow: As for my own part, I am one of thoſe of whom <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Tam umbratiles ſunt, ut putent in turbido eſſe quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid in luce eſt.</hi> Some men like ſome pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are fitter for a corner than a full light; and I believe ſuch as have a natural bent to ſolitude (to carry on the former ſimilitude) are like waters which may be forc'd into fountains and exalted into a great height, may make a noble figure and a louder noiſe, but after all they would run more ſmoothly, quietly and plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in their own natural courſe upon the ground. The conſideration of this would <note place="bottom">The foregoing Similitudes our Author had put into Verſe ſome years before and inſerted into Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s Poem on <hi>Mixt Life.</hi> We find him apparently in the Verſification of them, as they are ſince printed in <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s poſthumous Works, 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                  <p>YOU formerly obſerv'd to me, that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the diſparity we often find in him ſick and well: Thus one of an unfortunate conſtitution is perpetually exhibiting a miſerable example of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mind, and of his body, in their turns. I have had frequent opportunities of late to conſider my ſelf in theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent views, and I hope have receiv'd ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0096900402:29"/>
advantage by it, if what Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> ſays be true, that
<q>
                        <l>The ſoul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</l>
                        <l>Lets in new light thro' chinks that time has made.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then ſurely ſickneſs, contributing no leſs than old age to the ſhaking down this ſcaffolding of the body, may diſcover the inward ſtructure more plainly. Sickneſs is a ſort of early old age; it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly ſtate, and inſpires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thouſand volumes of philoſophers and divines. It gives ſo warning a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion to thoſe props of our vanity, our ſtrength and youth, that we think of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying our ſelves within, when there is ſo little dependance upon our out-works. Youth at the very beſt is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and ſmoother manner than age: 'Tis like a ſtream that nouriſhes a plant upon a bank, and cauſes it to flouriſh and bloſſom to the ſight, but at the ſame time is undermining it at the root in ſecret. My youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me, it has afforded ſeveral Proſpects of my danger, and given me an advantage not very common to young men, that the attractions of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0096900402:30"/>
world have not dazzled me very much; and I begin where moſt people end, with a full conviction of the emptineſs of all ſorts of ambition, and the unſatisfactory nature of all human pleaſures. When a ſmart fit of ſickneſs tells me this ſcurvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that honeſt <hi>Hibernian,</hi> who being in bed in the great ſtorm ſome years ago, and told the houſe would tumble over his head, made anſwer, What care I for the houſe? I am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the beſt time to die when one is in the beſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſo exceſſively weak as I now am I may ſay with conſcience, that I am not at all uneaſy at the thought that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men whom I never had any eſteem for, are likely to enjoy this world after me. When I reflect what an inconſiderable little attom every ſingle man is, with reſpect to the whole creation, methinks 'tis a ſhame to be concern'd at the removal of ſuch a trivial animal as I am. The morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Exit, the ſun will riſe as bright as ever, the flowers ſmell as ſweet, the plants ſpring as green, the world will proceed in its old courſe, people will laugh as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and marry as faſt as they were us'd to do. The memory of man, (as it is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly expreſs'd in the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon)</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0096900402:31"/>

                  <p>I Was the other day in company with five or ſix men of ſome learning; where chancing to mention the famous verſes which the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> ſpoke on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, they were all agreed that 'twas a piece of Gaiety unworthy of that Prince in thoſe circumſtances. I could not but differ from this opinion: Methinks it was by no means a gay, but a very ſerious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquy to his ſoul at the point of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; in which ſenſe I naturally took
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0096900402:32"/>
the verſes at my firſt reading them when I was very young, and before I knew what interpretation the world generally put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.<q>

                  <p>YOU have at length comply'd with the requeſt I have often made you, for you have ſhown me, I muſt confeſs, ſeveral of my faults in the ſight of thoſe letters. Upon a review of them, I find
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0096900402:38"/>
many things that would give me ſhame, if I were not more deſirous to be thought honeſt than prudent: ſo many things freely thrown out, ſuch lengths of unreſerv'd friendſhip, thoughts juſt warm from the brain, without any poliſhing or dreſs, the very diſhabille of the underſtanding. You have prov'd your ſelf more tender of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's embryo's than the fondeſt mothers are of their own, for you have preſerv'd every thing that I miſcarry'd of. Since I know this, I ſhall in one reſpect be more afraid of writing to you than ever, at this careleſs rate, becauſe I ſee my evil works may again riſe in judgment againſt me: Yet in another reſpect I ſhall be leſs afraid, ſince this has given me ſuch a proof of the extreme indulgence you afford to my ſlighteſt thoughts. The reviſal of theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters has been a kind of examination of conſcience to me; ſo fairly and faithfully have I ſet down in 'em from time to time the true and undiſtinguiſh'd ſtate of my mind. But I find that theſe, which were intended as sketches of my friendſhip, give as imperfect images of it, as the little landſcapes we commonly ſee in black and white, do of a beautiful country; they can repreſent but a very ſmall part of it, and that depriv'd of the life and luſtre of nature. I perceive that the more I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0096900402:39"/>
to render manifeſt the real affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and value I ever had for you, I did but injure it by repreſenting leſs and leſs of it: as glaſſes which are deſign'd to make an object very clear, generally contract it. Yet as when people have a full idea of a thing, firſt, upon their own knowledge, the leaſt traces of it ſerve to refreſh the remembrance, and are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing on that ſcore: So I hope the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge you had of my eſteem for you, is the reaſon that you do not diſlike my letters.</p>
                  <p>They will not be of any great ſervice (I find) in the deſign I mentioned to you: I believe I had better ſteal from a richer man, and plunder your letters, (which I have kept as carefully as I would Letters Patents, ſince they intitle me to what I more value than titles of honour.) You have ſome cauſe to apprehend this uſage from me, if what ſome ſay be true, that I am a great Borrower; however I have hitherto had the luck that none of my creditors have challeng'd me for it: and thoſe who ſay it are ſuch, whoſe writings no man ever borrow'd from, ſo have the leaſt reaſon to complain: Their works are granted on all hands to be but too much their own.—Another has been pleas'd to declare, that my Verſes are corrected by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0096900402:40"/>
other men: I verily believe theirs were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver corrected by any man: But indeed if mine have not, 'twas not my fault, I have endeavour'd my utmoſt that they ſhould. But theſe things are only whiſper'd, and I will not encroach upon <hi>Bays</hi>'s province and <hi>Pen Whiſpers,</hi> ſo haſten to conclude</p>

                  <p>THough any thing you write is ſure to be a pleaſure to me, yet I muſt own your laſt letter made me uneaſy: You really uſe a ſtyle of compliment, which I expect as little as I deſerve it. I know 'tis a common opinion that a young ſcribler is as ill pleas'd to hear truth as a young Lady. From the moment one ſets up for an author, one muſt be treated as ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly, that is as unfaithfully,
<q>
                        <l>As a King's Favourite, or as a King.</l>
                     </q>
This proceeding, join'd to that natural va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which firſt makes a man an author, is certainly enough to render him a cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb for life. But I muſt grant it is but a juſt judgment upon Poets, that they whoſe chief pretence is Wit, ſhou'd be treated juſt as they themſelves treat Fools, that is, be cajoll'd with praiſes. And I believe, Poets are the only poor fellows in the world whom any body will flatter.</p>

I would not be thought to ſay this as if the obliging letter you ſent me deſerv'd this imputation, only it put me in mind of it; and I fancy one may apply to one's friend what <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid of his Wife. <hi>It was not ſufficient that he knew her to be chaſt, himſelf, but ſhe ſhou'd not be ſo much as ſuſpected by others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the wonderful diſcoveries, and all the good news you are pleas'd to tell me of my ſelf; I treat it as you who are in the Secret treat common news, groundleſs reports of things at a diſtance, which I who look into the true ſprings of the affair at home, in my own breaſt, know to have no foundation at all. For <hi>Fame</hi> tho' it be as <hi>Milton</hi> finely calls it, <hi>The laſt Infirmity of noble Minds,</hi> is ſcarce ſo ſtrong a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as to warrant our loſs of time here: It can never make us lie down contentedly on a death-bed (as ſome of the ancients are ſaid to have done with that thought). You Sir have your ſelf taught me, that an eaſy ſituation at that hour, can proceed from no ambition leſs noble than that of an eternal felicity, which is unattainable by the ſtrongeſt endeavours of the Wit, but may be gain'd by the ſincere intentions of the Heart only. As in the next world, ſo in this, the only ſolid bleſſings are owing to the goodneſs of the mind, not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0096900402:44"/>
of the capacity: Friendſhip here is an emanation from the ſame ſource as Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude there: the ſame benevolence and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition that qualifies us for the one, if extended farther, makes us partakers of the other. The utmoſt point of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in my preſent ſtate terminates in the ſociety and good-will of worthy men, which I look upon as no ill earneſt and fore-taſte of the ſociety and alliance of happy ſouls hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The continuance of your favours to me is what not only makes me happy, but cauſes me to ſet ſome value upon my ſelf as a part of your care.

                  <p>The numerous and violent claps of the Whig-party on the one-ſide of the theatre, were eccho'd back by the Tories on the other; while the Author ſweated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ſcenes with concern, to find their applauſe proceeding more from the hand than the head. This was the caſe too of the Prologue-writer, who was clapp'd into a ſtanch Whig, at almoſt ev'ry two lines.

                  <p>YOUR laſt is the more obliging, as it hints at ſome little niceties in my conduct, which your candor and affection prompt you to recommend to me, and which (ſo trivial as things of this nature ſeem) are yet of no ſlight conſequence, to people whom every body talks of, and every body as he pleaſes. 'Tis a ſort of Tax that attends an eſtate in <hi>Parnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the ſmall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion an author holds. For indeed an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who is once come upon the town, is enjoy'd without being thank'd for the pleaſure, and ſometimes ill-treated by thoſe very perſons that firſt debauch'd him. Yet to tell you the bottom of my heart, I am no way diſpleas'd that I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the violent of all Parties already; and at the ſame time I aſſure you conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, I feel not the leaſt malevolence or reſentment againſt any of thoſe who miſrepreſent me, or are diſſatisfied with me. This frame of mind is ſo eaſy, that I am perfectly content with my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

As I hope and would flatter my ſelf, that you know me and my thoughts ſo entirely as never to be miſtaken in either, ſo 'tis a pleaſure to me that you gueſs'd ſo right in regard to the Author of that <hi>Guardian</hi> you mention'd. But I am ſorry to find it has taken air that I have ſome hand in thoſe Papers, becauſe I write ſo very few as neither to deſerve the credit of ſuch a report with ſome people, nor the diſrepute of it with others. An honeſt <hi>Jacobite</hi> ſpoke to me the ſenſe or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe of the weak part of his Party ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fairly, that the good people took it ill of me, that I writ with <hi>Steele,</hi> tho' upon never ſo indifferent ſubjects—This I know you will laugh at as well as I do: yet I doubt not but many little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators and perſons of ſower diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will take occaſion hence to beſpatter me. I confeſs I ſcorn narrow ſouls, of all parties, and if I renounce my reaſon in religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any other.</p>
                  <p>I can't imagine whence it comes to paſs that the few <hi>Guardians</hi> I have written are ſo generally known for mine: that in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which you mention I never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to any man but the publiſher, till ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately: yet almoſt every body I met told me of it.</p>

                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0096900402:53"/>
The true reaſon that Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> laid down the Paper, was a quarrel between him and <hi>Jacob Tonſon.</hi> He ſtood engag'd to his bookſeller, in articles of penalty, for all the <hi>Cuardians:</hi> and by deſiſting two days and altering the title of the paper to that of the <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> was quit of his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: theſe papers being printed by <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lcy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to his taking a more Politick turn, I cannot any way enter into that ſecret, nor have I been let into it, any more than into the reſt of his politicks. Tho 'tis ſaid, he will take into theſe papers alſo ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the politer kind, as before: But I aſſure you as to my ſelf, I have quite done with 'em, for the future. The little I have done, and the great reſpect I bear Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> as a Man of Wit, has render'd me a ſuſpected Whig to ſome of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but (as old <hi>Dryden</hi> ſaid before me) 'Tis not the Violent I deſign to pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>I generally employ the mornings in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Mr. <hi>Jervas</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Epiſtle to him in Verſe, writ about this time.</note>; and the evenings in the converſation of ſuch, as I think can moſt improve my mind, of whatever Party or Denomination they are.

The beſt way I know of overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Calumny and Miſconſtruction, is by a vigorous perſeverance in every thing we know to be right, and a total neglect of all that can enſue from it. 'Tis partly from this maxim that I depend upon your friendſhip, becauſe I believe it will do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to my intention in every thing; and give me leave to tell you, that (as the world goes) this is no ſmall aſſurance I repoſe in you.

                  <p>I Have been lying in wait for my own imagination, this week and more, and watching what thoughts came up in the whirl of the fancy, that were worth communicating to you in a letter. But I am at length convinc'd that my rambling head can produce nothing of that ſort; ſo I muſt e'en be contented with telling you the old ſtory, that I love you heartily. I have often found by experience, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0096900402:55"/>
and truth, tho' never ſo low or vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, are yet pleaſing when openly and artleſsly repreſented; it would be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, to read the very letters of an infant, could it write its innocent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies and tautologies juſt as it thought 'em. This makes me hope a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from me will not be unwelcome to you, when I am conſcious I write with more unreſervedneſs than ever man wrote, or perhaps talk'd to another. I truſt your good nature with the whole range of my follies, and really love you ſo well, that I would rather you ſhould pardon me than eſteem me, ſince one is an act of goodneſs and benevolence, the other a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd deference.</p>
                  <p>You can't wonder my thoughts are ſcarce conſiſtent, when I tell you how they are diſtracted. Ev'ry hour of my life, my mind is ſtrangely divided; this minute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I am above the ſtars, with a thouſand ſyſtems round about me, looking forward into a vaſt Abyſs, and loſing my whole comprehenſion in the boundleſs ſpace of creation, in dialogues with <hi>W<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Sickneſs and Pain is the lot of one half of us; Doubt and Fear the portion of the other! What a buſtle we make about paſſing our time, when all our ſpace is but a point? What aims and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions are crowded into this little inſtant of our life, which (as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> finely words it) is <hi>Rounded with a Sleep?</hi> Our whole extent of Being no more, in the eyes of him who gave it, than a ſcarce perceptible moment of duration. Thoſe animals whoſe circle of living is limited to three or four hours, as the Naturaliſts aſſure us, are yet as long-lived and poſſeſs as wide a ſcene of action as man, if we conſider him with an eye to all Space, and all Eternity.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0096900402:58"/>
and a few others, by writing. 'Tis no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable proſpect to be reflecting, that ſo long a ſiege as that of <hi>Troy</hi> lies upon my hands, and the campagne above half over, before I have made any progreſs. Indeed the <hi>Greek</hi> fortification upon a nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach does not appear ſo formidable as it did, and I am almoſt apt to flatter my ſelf, that <hi>Homer</hi> ſecretly ſeems inclined to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with me, in letting me into a good part of his intentions. There are indeed, a ſort of underling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work, call'd Commentators and Critics, who wou'd frighten many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by their number and bulk, and perplex our progreſs under pretence of fortifying their author. Theſe lie very low in the trenches and ditches they themſelves have digg'd, encompaſs'd with dirt of their own heaping up, but I think there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more ſpeedy and gallant way than by mining under ground, that is, by uſing the Poetical Engines, Wings, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their heads.</p>
                  <p>While I am engag'd in the fight, I find you are concern'd how I ſhall be paid, and are ſollicitous that I may not have the ill fate of many diſcarded Generals, to be firſt envy'd and malign'd, then perhaps prais'd, and laſtly neglected. The former (the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0096900402:59"/>
conſtant attendant upon all great and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enterprizes) I have already experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd. Some have ſaid I am not a Maſter in the <hi>Greek,</hi> who either are ſo themſelves or are not: If they are not, they can't tell; and if they are, they can't without having catechiz'd me. But if they can read (for I know ſome Critics can, and others cannot) there are fairly lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſome ſpecimens of my tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation from this Author in the <hi>Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,</hi> which they are heartily welcome to. I have met with as much malignity another way, ſome calling me a Tory, becauſe the heads of that party have been diſtinguiſhingly favourable to me; ſome a Whig becauſe I have been favour'd with yours, Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> his friendſhip, and of late with my Lord <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax</hi>'s Patronage. How much more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a concluſion might be form'd, by any good-natur'd man, that a perſon who has been well us'd by all ſides, has been offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to none. This miſerable age is ſo ſunk between animoſities of Party and thoſe of Religion, that I begin to fear, moſt men have politicks enough to make (thro' vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) the beſt Scheme of Government a bad one; and faith enough to hinder their own Salvation. I hope for my own part, never to have more of either than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0096900402:60"/>
with common juſtice and charity, and always as much as becomes a chriſtian and honeſt man. Tho' I find it an unfortunate thing to be bred a <hi>Papiſt</hi> here, where one is obnoxious to four parts in five as being ſo too much, and to the fifth part as being ſo too little; I ſhall yet be eaſy under both their miſtakes, and be what I more than ſeem to be, for I ſuffer for it. God is my witneſs that I no more envy you Proteſtants your places and poſſeſſions, than I do our Prieſts their charity or learning.

you my thanks for a very agreeable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment you juſt now gave me. I have accidentally met with your <hi>Rape of the Lock</hi> here, having never ſeen it before.

Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> came to me a night or two after <hi>Philips</hi> had talk'd in this idle manner, and aſſur'd me of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of what had been ſaid, of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip we ſhou'd always maintain, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd I would ſay nothing further of it.

However <hi>Philips</hi> did all

he could, ſecretly to continue the report with the <hi>Hanover</hi> Club, and kept in his hands the Subſcriptions paid for me to him, as Secretary to that Club.

This is the whole matter; but as to the ſecret grounds of <hi>Philips</hi>'s malignity, they will make a very pleaſant Hiſtory when we meet. Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> and ſome others have been much diverted with it, and moſt of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Club have made it the ſubject of their ridicule on their Secretary.

                  <p>YOU mention the account I gave you ſome time ago of the things which <hi>Philips</hi> ſaid in his fooliſhneſs; but I can't tell from any thing in your Letter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you receiv'd a long one from me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a fortnight ſince. It was principally intended to thank you for the laſt obliging favour you did me; and perhaps for that reaſon you paſs it in ſilence. I there launch'd into ſome account of my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs, and intend now to give you ſome hints of my ſpiritual. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your Letter draws this upon you, where you tell me, you <hi>pray'd</hi> for me: Your proceeding, Sir, is contrary to that of moſt other Friends, who never talk of praying for a Man after they have done
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0096900402:66"/>
him a ſervice, but only when they will do him none. Nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human Sciences, which I aſſure you I am daily more and more convinc'd of; and indeed I have for ſome years paſt, look'd upon all of 'em no better than amuſements. To make them the ultimate end of our purſuit, is a miſerable and ſhort ambition, which will drop from us at ev'ry little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment here, and even in caſe of no diſappointments here, will infallibly deſert us hereafter. The utmoſt fame they are capable of beſtowing, is never worth the pains they coſt us, and the time they loſe us. If you attain the top of your deſires that way, all thoſe who envy you will do you harm; and of thoſe who admire you, few will do you good. The unſucceſsful writers are your declared enemies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the ſucceſsful your ſecret ones: For thoſe hate not more to be excell'd, than theſe to be rivall'd. And at the upſhot, after a life of perpetual application, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that you have been doing nothing for your ſelf, and that the ſame or leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry might have gain'd you a Friendſhip that can never deceive or end, a ſatisfaction which praiſe cannot beſtow, nor vanity feel, and a glory which (tho' in one reſpect like fame, not to be had 'till after death,) yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0096900402:67"/>
ſhall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. Theſe, dear Sir, are unfeignedly my ſentiments, whenever I think at all; for half the things that employ our heads deſerve not the name of thoughts, they are only ſtronger dreams or impreſſions upon the imagination: Our ſchemes of government, our ſyſtems of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, our golden worlds of poetry, are all but ſo many ſhadowy images, and airy proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, which ariſe to us but ſo much the livelier and more frequent, as we are more o'ercaſt with the darkneſs, and diſturb'd with the fumes of human vanity.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing that makes old men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave this world, makes me willing to leave poetry, long-habit, and wearineſs of the ſame track. <hi>Homer</hi> will work a cure upon me; fifteen thouſand verſes are equivalent to fourſcore years, to make one old in Rhime: And I ſhou'd be ſorry and aſhamed, to go on jingling to the laſt ſtep, like a waggoner's horſe, in the ſame road, and ſo leave my <hi>Bells</hi> to the next ſilly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal that will be proud of 'em. That man makes a mean figure in the eyes of reaſon, who is meaſuring ſyllables and coupling rhimes, when he ſhou'd be mending his own Soul, and ſecuring his own immortality.

                  <p>I find by dear experience, we live in an age, where it is criminal to be moderate; and where no one man can be allowed to be juſt to all men. The notions of right and wrong are ſo far ſtrain'd, that perhaps to be in the right ſo very violently, may be of worſe conſequence than to be eaſily and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in the wrong. I really wiſh all men ſo well, that I am ſatisfied but few can wiſh me ſo; but if thoſe few are ſuch as tell me they do, I am content, for they are the beſt people I know: While you believe me what I profeſs as to Religion, I can bear any thing the bigotted may ſay; while Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> likes my poetry, I can endure <hi>Dennis</hi> and a thouſand more like him; while the moſt honeſt and moral of each party think me no ill man, I can eaſily ſupport it, tho' the moſt violent and mad of all parties roſe up to throw dirt at me.</p>
                  <p>I muſt expect an hundred attacks upon the publication of my <hi>Homer.</hi> Whoever in our times would be a profeſſor of learning above his fellows, ought at the very firſt to enter the world with the conſtancy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of a primitive Chriſtian, and be prepared to ſuffer all ſort of publick Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.

It is certainly to be lamented, that if any man does but endeavour to diſtinguiſh himſelf, or gratify others by his ſtudies, he is immediately treated as a common enemy, inſtead of being look'd upon as a common friend; and aſſaulted as generally, as if his whole deſign were to prejudice the State, and ruin the publick. I will venture to ſay, no man ever roſe to any degree of perfection in writing, but through obſtinacy and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate reſolution againſt the ſtream of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: So that if the world has receiv'd any benefit from the labours of the Learned, it was in its own deſpite. For when firſt they eſſay their parts, all people in general are prejudiced againſt new beginners; and when they have got a little above contempt, then ſome particular perſons who were before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in their own attempts, are ſworn foes to them only becauſe they ſucceed.—Upon the whole, one may ſay of the beſt writers, that they pay a ſevere fine for their fame, which it is always in the power of the moſt worthleſs part of mankind to levy upon them when they pleaſe.</p>

I fancy no friendſhip is ſo likely to prove laſting as ours, becauſe I am pretty ſure there never was a friendſhip of ſo eaſie a nature. We neither of us demand any mighty things from each other; what Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we have expects its gratification from other people. It is not I, that am to tell you what an Artiſt you are, nor is it you that are to tell me what a Poet I am; but 'tis from the world abroad we hope, (piouſly hope) to hear theſe things. At home we follow our buſineſs, when we have any; and think and talk moſt of each other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike the happy friendſhip of a ſtay'd man and his wife, who are ſeldom ſo fond as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the buſineſs of the houſe from going on all day, or ſo indolent as not to find conſolation in each other every evening. Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity to the laſt, by not expecting too much from human nature; while romantick friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, like violent loves, begin with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, proceed to jealouſies, and conclude in animoſities. I have liv'd to ſee the fierce advancement, the ſudden turn, and the abrupt period, of three or four of theſe enormous friendſhips, and am perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the truth of a Maxim we once agreed in, That nothing hinders the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant agreement of people who live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

but meer vanity; a ſecret inſiſting upon what they think their dignity or merit, and an inward expectation of ſuch an Over-meaſure of deference and regard, as anſwers to their own extravagant falſe ſcale; and which no body can pay, becauſe none but themſelves can tell, exactly, to what pitch it amounts?</p>

well as I love them both; or at leaſt hurt each other as little as I would either; and that our own people may live as quietly as we ſhall certainly let theirs; that is to ſay, that want of <hi>power</hi> it ſelf in us may not be a ſurer prevention of harm, than want of <hi>will</hi> in them.

He aſſured me that he wou'd make uſe not only of his intereſt, but of his art to do you ſome ſervice; he did not mean his Art of Poetry, but his Art at Court; and he is ſenſible that nothing can have a better air for himſelf, than moving in your favour, eſpecially ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations were ſpread that he did not care you ſhou'd proſper too much as a Poet. He proteſts that it ſhall not be his fault if there is not the beſt intelligence in the world, and the moſt hearty friendſhip, &amp;c. He owns, he was afraid Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> might have carry'd you too far among the enemy during the heat of the animoſity, but now
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0096900402:80"/>
all is ſafe, and you are eſcap'd even in his opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I promis'd in your name, like a good Godfather, not that you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the devil and all his works, but that you would be delighted to find him your friend merely for his own ſake; therefore prepare your ſelf for ſome civilities.</p>
                  <p>I have done <hi>Homer</hi>'s head, ſhadow'd and heighten'd carefully; and I incloſe the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line of the ſame ſize, that you may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether you wou'd have it ſo large, or reduc'd to make room for feuillage or laurel round the oval, or about the ſquare of the Buſto? Perhaps there is ſomething more ſolemn in the Image itſelf, if I can get it well perform'd.</p>
                  <p>If I have been inſtrumental in bringing you and Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> together with all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, I value my ſelf upon it as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable piece of ſervice to ſuch a one as I know you to be.</p>

the Queen's death. No panegyricks ready yet for the King.</p>
                  <p>I admire your <hi>Whig-principles</hi> of Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance exceedingly, in the ſpirit of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celonians.</hi> I joyn in your wiſh for them.

                  <p>What you mention'd of the friendly office you endeavour'd to do betwixt Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> and me, deſerves acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on my part. You thoroughly know my regard to his character, and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to teſtify it by all ways in my power. You as thoroughly know the ſcandalous meanneſs of that proceeding which was uſed by <hi>Philips,</hi> to make a man I ſo highly value, ſuſpect my diſpoſitions toward him. But as, after all, Mr. <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> muſt be the judge in what regards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and has ſeem'd to be no very juſt one to me; ſo I muſt own to you I expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but civility from him, how much ſoever I wiſh for his friendſhip: And as for any offices of real kindneſs or ſervice which it is in his power to do me, I ſhould be aſham'd to receive 'em from any man who had no better opinion of my morals, than to think me a party-man; nor of my temper, than to believe me capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligning,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0096900402:82"/>
or envying another's reputation as a Poet. So I leave it to time to convince him as to both, to ſhew him the ſhallow depths of thoſe half-witted creatures who miſ-inform'd him, and to prove that I am incapable of endeavouring to leſſen a perſon whom I would be proud to imitate, and therefore aſham'd to flatter. In a word, Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> is ſure of my reſpect at all times, and of my real friendſhip when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhall think fit to know me for what I am.</p>
                  <p>For all that paſs'd betwixt Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> and me, you know the whole (without reſerve) of our correſpondence: The engagements I had to him were ſuch as the actual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he had done me, in relation to the ſubſcription for <hi>Homer,</hi> obliged me to. I muſt have leave to be grateful to him, and to any one who ſerves me, let him be never ſo obnoxious to any party: nor did the <hi>Tory-party</hi> ever put me to the hardſhip of aſking this leave, which is the greateſt obligation I owe to it; and I expect no greater from the <hi>Whig-party</hi> than the ſame liberty.—A curſe on the word <hi>Party,</hi> which I have been forc'd to uſe ſo often in this period! I wiſh the preſent Reign may put an end to the diſtinction, that there may be no other for the future than that of honeſt and knave, fool and man of ſenſe;

                  <p>I Have been acquainted by one of my friends who omits no opportunities of gratifying me, that you have lately been pleas'd to ſpeak of me in a manner which nothing but the real reſpect I have for you can deſerve. May I hope that ſome late malevolencies have loſt their effect? Indeed it is neither for me, nor my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to pretend to tell you whether I am your friend or not; but if you would judge by probabilities, I beg to know which of your poetical acquaintance has ſo little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in pretending to be ſo? Methinks no man ſhould queſtion the real friendſhip of one who deſires no real ſervice: I am only to get as much from the <hi>Whigs,</hi> as I got by the <hi>Tories,</hi> that is to ſay, Civility; being neither ſo proud as to be inſenſible of any good office, nor ſo humble, as not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0096900402:84"/>
to dare heartily to deſpiſe any man who does me an injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>I will not value my ſelf upon having ever guarded all the degrees of reſpect for you; for (to ſay the truth) all the world ſpeaks well of you, and I ſhould be under a neceſſity of doing the ſame, whether I car'd for you or not.</p>
                  <p>As to what you have ſaid of me, I ſhall never believe that the Author of <hi>Cato</hi> can ſpeak one thing and think another. As a proof that I account you ſincere, I beg a favour of you: It is, that you would look over the two firſt books of my tranſlation of <hi>Homer,</hi> which are now in the hands of my Lord <hi>Halifax.</hi> I am ſenſible how much the reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you give it: 'tis therefore ſome evidence of the truſt I repoſe in your good will, when I give you this opportunity of ſpeaking ill of me with juſtice, and yet expect you will tell me your trueſt thoughts, at the ſame time that you tell others your moſt favourable ones.</p>
                  <p>I have a farther requeſt, which I muſt preſs with earneſtneſs. My Bookſeller is reprinting the <hi>Eſſay on Criticiſm,</hi> to which you have done too much honour in your <hi>Spectator</hi> of N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 253. The period in that paper, where you ſay, <q rend="inline">"I have admitted ſome ſtrokes of ill nature into that Eſſay,"</q>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0096900402:85"/>
is the only one I could wiſh omitted of all you have written: but I wou'd not deſire it ſhould be ſo, unleſs I had the merit of removing your objection: I beg you but to point out thoſe ſtrokes to me, and you may be aſſured they ſhall be treated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy.</p>
                  <p>Since we are upon proofs of ſincerity (which I am pretty confident will turn to the advantage of us both in each others opinion) give me leave to name another paſſage in the ſame <hi>Spectator,</hi> which I wiſh you would alter. It is where you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an obſervation upon <hi>Homer</hi>'s Verſes of <hi>Syſiphus</hi>'s Stone, as <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe Words are ſince left out in Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi>'s Edition, but were extant in all during Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s Life.</note>

                  <p>THE Farce of the <hi>What-d'ye-call-it,</hi> has occaſioned many different ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in the town.

vociferous kind of criticks, went with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to hiſs, and confeſt they were forced to laugh ſo much, that they forgot the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign they came with. The Court in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral has in a very particular manner come into the jeſt, and the three firſt Nights, (notwithſtanding two of them were court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights) were diſtinguiſh'd by very full audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the firſt quality. The common people of the pit and gallery, receiv'd it at firſt with great gravity and ſedateneſs, ſome few with tears; but after the third day they alſo took the hint, and have ever ſince been very loud in their claps. There are ſtill ſome ſober men who cannot be of the general opinion, but the laughers are ſo much the majority, that one or two criticks ſeem determined to undeceive the town at their proper coſt, by writing grave diſſertations againſt it: To encourage them in which laudable deſign, it is reſolv'd a <hi>Preface</hi> ſhall be prefixt to the <hi>Farce,</hi> in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writing.</p>

                  <p>IF your Mare could ſpeak, ſhe would give you an account of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary company ſhe had on the road; which ſince ſhe cannot do, I will.</p>
                  <p>It was the enterprizing Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> the redoubtable rival of Mr. <hi>Tonſon,</hi> who mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a ſtonehorſe, (no diſagreeable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to your Lordſhips mare) overtook me in <hi>Windſor-foreſt.</hi> He ſaid, he heard I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for <hi>Oxford,</hi> the ſeat of the muſes, and would, as my bookſeller, by all means, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me thither.</p>
                  <p>I aſk'd him where he got his horſe? He anſwer'd, he got it of his publiſher: <q rend="inline">"For that rogue, my printer, (ſaid he) diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me: I hoped to put him in good humour by a treat at the tavern, of a brown fricaſſee of rabbits which coſt two ſhillings, with two quarts of wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides my converſation. I thought my ſelf cockſure of his horſe, which he readily promis'd me, but ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Tonſon</hi> had juſt ſuch another deſign of going to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> expecting there the copy of <hi>a Comment upon the Revelations;</hi> and if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0096900402:96"/>
Mr. <hi>Tonſon</hi> went, he was preingaged to attend him, being to have the printing of the ſaid copy."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in ſhort, I borrow'd this ſtonehorſe of my publiſher, which he had of Mr. <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixon</hi> for a debt; he lent me too the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty boy you ſee after me; he was a ſmutty dog yeſterday, and coſt me near two hours to waſh the ink off his face: but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is a fair-condition'd Devil, and very forward in his catechiſe: if you have any more baggs, he ſhall carry them.</p>
                  <p>I thought Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi>'s civility not to be neglected, ſo gave the boy a ſmall bagg, containing three ſhirts and an Elzevir <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil;</hi> and mounting in an inſtant proceeded on the road, with my man before, my courteous ſtationer beſide, and the aforeſaid Devil behind.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> began in this manner. <q rend="inline">"Now damn them! what if they ſhould put it into the news-paper, how you and I went together to <hi>Oxford?</hi> why what would I care? If I ſhould go down into <hi>Suſſex,</hi> they would ſay I was gone to the Speaker.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon I enquir'd of his ſon. <q rend="inline">"The lad (ſays he) has fine parts, but is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

                  </p>
                  <p>Don't you deſign to let him paſs a year at <hi>Oxford?</hi>
                     <q rend="inline">"To what purpoſe? (ſaid he) the Univerſities do but make Pedants, and I intend to breed him a man of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> was talking, I obſerv'd he ſate uneaſy on his ſaddle, for which I expreſs'd ſome ſollicitude: Nothing ſays he, I can bear it well enough; but ſince we have the day before us, methinks it would be very pleaſant for you to reſt a-while under the Woods. When were alighted, <q rend="inline">"See here, what a mighty pretty <hi>Horace</hi> I have in my pocket? what if you amus'd your ſelf in turning an Ode, till we mount again?

                  <p>Silence enſu'd for a full hour; after which <hi>Mr. Lintott</hi> lug'd the reins, ſtopt

                  <p>Pray Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> (ſaid I) now you talk of Tranſlators, what is your method of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging them? <q rend="inline">"Sir (reply'd he) thoſe are the ſaddeſt pack of rogues in the world: In a hungry fit, they'll ſwear they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all the languages in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: I have known one of them take down a <hi>Greek</hi> book upon my counter and cry, Ay this is <hi>Hebrew,</hi> I muſt read it from the latter end.

                  <p>—I congratulate you upon Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi>'s firſt Book. It does not indeed want its merit; but I was ſtrangely diſappointed in my expectation of a Tranſlation nicely true to the original; whereas in thoſe parts where the greateſt exactneſs ſeems to be demanded, he has been the leaſt careful, I mean the Hiſtory of <hi>ancient Ceremonies and Rites,</hi> &amp;c. in which you have with great judgment been exact.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0096900402:107"/>
aſſure you of the continuance of that eſteem and affection I have long born you, and the memory of ſo many agreeable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations as we have paſs'd together. I wiſh it were a compliment to ſay ſuch conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations as are not to be found on this ſide of the Water: for the Spirit of Diſſention is gone forth among us; nor is it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Button</hi>'s is no longer <hi>Button</hi>'s, when <hi>Old England</hi> is no longer <hi>Old England,</hi> that region of hoſpitality, ſociety, and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Party affects us all, even the wits, tho' they gain as little by politicks as they do by their wit. We talk much of fine ſenſe, refin'd ſenſe, and exalted ſenſe; but for uſe and happineſs give me a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe. I ſay this in regard to ſome gentlemen, profeſs'd wits of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who fancy they can make Poetry of conſequence at this time of day, in the midſt of this raging fit of Politicks. For they tell me, the buſy part of the nation are not more divided about <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> than theſe idle fellows of the Feather about Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi>'s and my Tranſlation. I (like the <hi>Tories)</hi> have the town in general, that is the mob, on my ſide; but 'tis uſual with the ſmaller Party to make up in induſtry what they want in number, and that's the caſe with the little Senate of <hi>Cato.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if our Principles be well conſider'd, I

muſt appear a brave <hi>Whig,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi> a rank <hi>Tory;</hi> I tranſlated <hi>Homer</hi> for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in general, he to gratify the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſires of One man only. We have it ſeems, a great <hi>Turk</hi> in Poetry, who can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bear a Brother on the throne; and has his Mutes too, a ſett of Nodders, Winkers, and Whiſperers, whoſe buſineſs is to ſtrangle all other offsprings of wit in their birth. The new Tranſlator of <hi>Homer</hi> is the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ſlave he has, that is to ſay, his firſt Miniſter; let him receive the honours he gives him, but receive them with fear and trembling: let him be proud of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his abſolute Lord; I appeal to the People, as my rightful judges and maſters; and if they are not inclin'd to condemn me, I fear no arbitrary high-flying proceedings from the ſmall Court-faction at <hi>Button</hi>'s. But after all I have ſaid of this great Man, there is no rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: We are each of us ſo civil and obliging, that neither thinks he is obliged. And I for my part treat with him, as we do with the <hi>Grand Monarch;</hi> who has too many great qualities not to be reſpected, tho' we know he watches any occaſion to oppreſs us.</p>
                  <p>When I talk of <hi>Homer,</hi> I muſt not forget the early Preſent you made me of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de la Motte</hi>'s Book. And I can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

However it be, either of theſe precepts is extreamly proper to be followed at this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and I cannot but applaud your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of continuing in what you call your Cave in the foreſt, this winter; and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the noiſe of breaking Ice to that of breaking Stateſmen, the rage of Storms to that of Parties, and fury and ravage of Floods and Tempeſts, to the precipitancy of ſome, and the ruin of others, which I fear will be our daily proſpect in <hi>London.</hi>

                  <p>I ſincerely wiſh my ſelf with you, to contemplate the wonders of God in the firmament, rather than the madneſs of man on the earth. But I never had ſo much cauſe as now to complain of my poetical ſtar, that fixes me at this tumultuous time, to attend the gingling of rymes and the meaſuring of ſyllables: To be almoſt the only trifler in the nation; and as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as the Poet in <hi>Petronius,</hi> who while all the reſt in the ſhip were either labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or praying for life, was ſcratching his head in a little room, to write a fine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the tempeſt.</p>
                  <p>You tell me you like the ſound of no arms but thoſe of <hi>Achilles:</hi> for my part I like them as little as the others.

I heartily joyn with you in wiſhing Quiet to our native country: Quiet in the ſtate, which like charity in religion, is too much the perfection and happineſs of either, to be broken or violated on any pretence or proſpect whatſoever: Fire and ſword, and fire and faggot are equally my averſion. I can pray for oppoſite parties, and for oppoſite religions, with great ſincerity. I think to be a lover of one's Country is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Elogy, but I do not think it ſo great an one as to be a lover of Mankind.</p>

                  <p>THAT you have not heard from me of late, aſcribe not to the uſual lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Correſpondent, but to a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where your name is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd with honour, even in a land flowing with Tories. I had the good fortune there to be often in the converſation of Doctor <hi>Clarke:</hi> He entertain'd me with ſeveral Drawings, and particularly with the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſigns of <hi>Inigo Jones</hi>'s <hi>Whitehall.</hi> I there ſaw and reverenced ſome of your firſt Pieces; which future Painters are to look upon as we Poets do on the <hi>Culex</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Batrachom.</hi> of <hi>Homer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having named this latter piece, give me leave to aſk what is become of Dr. <hi>Parnelle</hi> and his Frogs? <hi>Oblitusque meorum, obliviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendus &amp; illis,</hi> might be <hi>Horace</hi>'s wiſh, but will never be mine, while I have ſuch <hi>meo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums</hi> as Dr. <hi>Parnelle</hi> and Dr. <hi>Swift.</hi> I hope the ſpring will reſtore you to us, and with you all the beauties and colours of nature. Not but I congratulate you on the pleaſure you muſt take in being admir'd in your own Country, which ſo ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to Prophets and Poets. But in this you
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0096900402:120"/>
have the Advantage of Poets; you are Maſter of an Art that muſt proſper and grow rich, as long as people love, or are proud of themſelves, or their own perſons. However, you have ſtay'd long enough, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, to have painted all the numberleſs Hiſtories of old <hi>Ogygiae.</hi> If you have begun to be Hiſtorical, I recommend to your hand the ſtory which every pious <hi>Iriſhman</hi> ought to begin with, that of St. <hi>Patrick:</hi> To the end you may be obliged (as Dr. <hi>P.</hi> was, when he tranſlated the <hi>Batrachomuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machia)</hi> to come into <hi>England</hi> to copy the Frogs, and ſuch other Vermine as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen in that land ſince the time of that Confeſſor.</p>
                  <p>I long to ſee you a Hiſtory Painter. You have already done enough for the Private, do ſomething for the Publick; and be not confined, like the reſt, to draw only ſuch ſilly ſtories as our own faces tell of us. The Ancients too expect you ſhould do them right; thoſe Statues from which you learn'd your beautiful and noble Ideas, demand it as a piece of Gratitude from you, to make them truly known to all nations, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you intend to write of their <hi>Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> I hope you think more warmly than ever of that noble deſign.</p>
                  <p>As to your enquiry about your Houſe, when I come within the walls, they put
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0096900402:121"/>
me in mind of thoſe of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where your Friend, like the wandring <hi>Trojan,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Animum Pictura paſcit inani.</l>
                     </q>
For the ſpacious Manſion, like a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Caravanſerah, entertains the Vagabond with only bare Lodging. I rule the Family very ill, keep bad Hours, and lend out your Pictures about the Town. See what it is to have a Poet in your Houſe! <hi>Frank</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does all he can in ſuch a Circumſtance, for conſidering he has a wild Beaſt in it, he conſtantly keeps the Door chain'd. Every time it is open'd, the Links rattle, the ruſty Hinges roar, the Houſe ſeems ſo ſenſible that you are its ſupport, that it is ready to drop in your Abſence; but I ſtill truſt myſelf under its Roof, as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Providence will preſerve ſo many <hi>Raphaels, Titian's</hi> and <hi>Guido's,</hi> as are lodg'd in your Cabinet. Surely the Sins of one Poet can hardly be ſo heavy, as to bring an old Houſe over the Heads of ſo many Painters. In a word, your Houſe is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but what of that? I am only a Lodger.</p>

                  <p>LAST poſt brought me the favour of your letter of the 10th <hi>Aug. O. S.</hi> It would be taking too much upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, that 'twas a Witty one; I never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to more judgment than to know what pleaſes me, and can aſſure you, it was a very Agreeable one. The proof I can give you of my ſincerity in this Opinion, is, that I hope and deſire you would not ſtop at this, but continue more of them.</p>
                  <p>I am in a place where Pleaſure is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually flowing. The Princes ſet the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the Subjects follow at a diſtance. The Ladies are of all parties, by which means the converſation of the Men is very much ſoftened and faſhioned from thoſe blunt diſputes on Politicks, and rough Jeſts, we are ſo guilty of; while the Freedom of the Women takes away all Formality and Conſtraint. I muſt own, at the ſame time, theſe Beauties are a little too artificial for my Taſte; you have ſeen a <hi>French</hi> Picture, the Original is more painted, and ſuch a cruſt of Powder and eſſence in their Hair, that you can ſee no difference between
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0096900402:123"/>
black and red. By diſuſing Stays, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging themſelves at Table, they are run out of all Shape; but as to that, they may give a good reaſon, they prefer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to Parade, and are by this means as ready, as they are generally willing to be Charitable.</p>
                  <p>I am ſurpriz'd to find I have wrote ſo much Scandal; I fancy I am either ſetting up for a Wit, or imagine I muſt Write in this Style to a Wit; I hope you'll prove a good natured one, and not only let me hear from you ſometimes, but forgive the ſmall Encouragement you meet with.

                  <p>I Have long had it in my thoughts to trouble you with a Letter, but was diſcouraged for want of ſomething that I could think worth ſending fifteen hundred Miles. <hi>Italy</hi> is ſuch an exhauſted Subject, that, I dare ſay, you'd eaſily forgive my ſaying nothing of it; and the imagination of a Poet, is a thing ſo nice and delicate, that it is no eaſy matter to find out Images capable of giving Pleaſure to one of the few, who (in any Age) have come up to that Character. I am nevertheleſs lately return'd from an Iſland, where I paſſed three or four Months, which, were it ſet out in its true Colours, might methinks amuſe you agreeably enough for a minute or two. The Iſland <hi>Inarime,</hi> is an Epitome of the whole Earth, containing within the compaſs of eighteen Miles, a wonderful variety of Hills, Vales, ragged Rocks, fruitful Plains, and barren Mountains, all thrown together in a moſt romantic Confuſion. The Air is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0096900402:125"/>
in the hotteſt Seaſon, conſtantly refreſhed by cool breezes from the Sea. The Vales produce excellent Wheat and <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, but are moſtly covered with Vineyards, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt with Fruit-trees. Beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon kinds, as Cherries, Apricots, Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp;c. they produce Oranges, Limes, Almonds, Pomegranates, Figs, Water Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and many other Fruits unknown to our Climates, which lie every where open to the Paſſenger. The Hills are the greater part covered to the top with Vines, ſome with Cheſnut Groves, and others with thickets of Myrtle and Lentiſcus. The Fields in the Northern ſide are divided by hedge-rows of Myrtle. Several Fountains and Rivulets add to the Beauty of this Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, which is likewiſe ſet off by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſome barren Spots, and naked Rocks. But that which crowns the Scene, is a large Mountain, riſing out of the middle of the Iſland (once a terrible <hi>Volcano,</hi> by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called <hi>Mons Epomeus)</hi> its lower parts are adorned with Vines, and other Fruits, the middle affords Paſture to flocks of Goats and Sheep, and the top is a ſandy pointed Rock, from which you have the fineſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in the World, ſurveying at one view, beſides ſeveral pleaſant Iſlands lying at your Feet, a tract of <hi>Italy</hi> about three hundred Miles in length, from the Promontory of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0096900402:126"/>
                     <hi>Antium,</hi> to the Cape of <hi>Palinurus.</hi> The greater part of which, hath been ſung by <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> as making a conſiderable part of the Travels and Adventures of their two Heroes. The Iſlands <hi>Caprea, Prochyta,</hi> and <hi>Parthenope,</hi> together with <hi>Cajeta, Cumae, Monte Miſeno,</hi> the Habitations of <hi>Circe,</hi> the <hi>Syrens,</hi> and the <hi>Leſtrygones,</hi> the Bay of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Promontory of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and the whole <hi>Campagnia felice,</hi> make but a part of this noble Landſcape; which would demand an Imagination as warm, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as flowing as your own, to deſcribe it. The Inhabitants of this delicious Iſle, as they are without Riches and Honours, ſo are they without the Vices and Follies that attend them; and were they but as much ſtrangers to Revenge, as they are to Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice or Ambition, they might in fact anſwer the poetical Notions of the Golden Age. But they have got, as an alloy to their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, an ill habit of murdering one another on ſlight Offences. We had an Inſtance of this the ſecond Night after our Arrival; a Youth of eighteen, being ſhot dead by our Door: And yet by the ſole ſecret of minding our own Buſineſs, we found a means of living ſecurely among theſe dangerous People. Would you know how we paſs the time at <hi>Naples?</hi> Our chief En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment is the Devotion of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0096900402:127"/>
Beſides the gayety of their Churches (where Folks go to ſee what they call <hi>una bella Devotione</hi> (i. e.) a ſort of Religious Opera) they make Fireworks almoſt every Week, out of Devotion; the Streets are often hung with Arras, out of Devotion; and (what is ſtill more ſtrange) the Ladies invite Gentlemen to their Houſes, and treat them with Muſick and Sweetmeats, out of Devotion; in a word, were it not for this Devotion of its Inhabitants, <hi>Naples</hi> would have little elſe to recommend it, beſide the Air and Situation. Learning is in no very thriving ſtate here, as indeed no where elſe in <hi>Italy.</hi> However, among many pretenders, ſome Men of taſte are to be met with. A Friend of mine told me not long ſince, that being to viſit <hi>Salvini</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> he found him reading your <hi>Homer.</hi> He liked the Notes extreamly, and could find no other fault with the Verſion, but that he thought it approached too near a Paraphraſe; which ſhews him not to be ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our Language. I wiſh you Health to go on with that noble Work, and when you have that, I need not wiſh your Succeſs.

One that had been a Poet, was degraded to a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and at laſt thro' meer dulneſs is turn'd an Architect. You know <hi>Martial</hi>'s Cenſure—<hi>Praeconem facito, vel Architectum.</hi> However I have one way left, to plan, to <hi>elevate,</hi> and

                     <hi>to ſurprize</hi> (as <hi>Bays</hi> ſays.) The next you may expect to hear, is that I am in Debt.</p>
                  <p>The Hiſtory of my Tranſplantation and Settlement which you deſire, would require a Volume, were I to enumerate the many projects, difficulties, viciſſitudes, and various fates attending that important part of my Life: Much more, ſhould I deſcribe the many Draughts, Elevations, Profiles, Perſpectives, &amp;c. of every Palace and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den propos'd, intended, and happily raiſed, by the ſtrength of that Faculty wherein all great Genius's excel, Imagination. At laſt, the Gods and Fate have fix'd me on the borders of the <hi>Thames,</hi> in the Diſtricts of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Twickenham.</hi> It is here I have paſt an entire Year of my life, without any fix'd abode in <hi>London,</hi> or more than caſting a tranſitory glance (for a day or two at moſt in a Month) on the pomps of the Town. It is here I hope to receive you, Sir, return'd in triumph from Eternizing the <hi>Ireland</hi> of <hi>this Age.</hi> For you my Structures riſe; for you my Colonades extend their Wings; for you my Groves aſpire, and Roſes bloom. And to ſay truth, I hope Poſterity (which no doubt will be made acquainted with all theſe things) will look upon it as one of the principal Motives of my Architecture, that it was a Manſion prepar'd to receive you, againſt your own

ſhould fall to duſt, which is deſtin'd to be the Tomb of poor—and—and the immortal Monument of the Fidelity of two ſuch Servants, who have excell'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy the very Rats of your Family.</p>
                  <p>What more can I tell you of myſelf? ſo much, and yet all put together ſo little, that I ſcarce care, or know, how to do it. But the very reaſons that are againſt putting it upon Paper, are as ſtrong for telling it you in Perſon; and I am uneaſy to be ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd the ſatisfaction of it.</p>

whoſe Memory I am erecting the beſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument I can.

                  <p>I Had pleas'd myſelf ſooner in writing to you, but that I have been your Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in a Fit of Sickneſs, and am not yet ſo much recovered, but that I have thoughts of uſing your <note n="*" place="bottom">Aſſes.</note>Phyſicians. They are as grave Perſons as any of the Faculty, and (like the Antients) carry their own Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments about with them. But indeed the Moderns are ſuch lovers of Raillery, that nothing is grave enough to eſcape them. Let 'em laugh, but People will ſtill have their Opinions: As they think our Doctors Aſſes to them, we'll think them Aſſes to our Doctors.</p>

I am glad you are ſo much in a better ſtate of Health, as to allow me to jeſt about it. My concern, when I heard of your Danger, was ſo very ſerious, that I almoſt take it ill Dr. <hi>Evans</hi> ſhould tell you of it, or you mention it. I tell you fairly, if you and a few more ſuch people were to leave the World, I would not give ſix-pence to ſtay in it.</p>
                  <p>I am not ſo much concern'd as to the point, whether you are to live fat or lean: Moſt Men of Wit or Honeſty are uſually decreed to live very lean; ſo I am inclined to the opinion that 'tis decreed you ſhall: However be comforted, and reflect that you'll make the better Buſto for it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſomething particular in you, not to be ſatisfied with ſending me your own Books, but to make your Acquaintance continue the frolick. Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> forc'd me to take <hi>Gorboduc,</hi> which has ſince done me great credit with ſeveral people, as it has done <hi>Dryden</hi> and <hi>Oldham</hi> ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, in ſhewing there is as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between their <hi>Gorbuduc,</hi> and this, as between Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and King <hi>George.</hi> It is truly a ſcandal, that Men ſhould write with contempt of a Piece which they never once ſaw, as thoſe two Poets did, who were ignorant even of the Sex, as well as Senſe, of <hi>Gorboduc.</hi>

                  <p>TO convince you how little pain I give myſelf, in correſponding with Men of good Nature, and good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you ſee I omit to anſwer your Letters till a time, when another man would be aſhamed to own he had received them. If
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0096900402:136"/>
therefore you are ever moved on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by that Spirit, which I take to be as familiar to you as a Quotidian Ague, I mean the Spirit of Goodneſs, pray never ſtint it, in any fear of obliging me to a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility beyond my natural Inclination: I dare truſt you, Sir, not only with my Folly when I write, but with my Negligence when I do not; and expect equally your pardon for either.</p>
                  <p>If I knew how to entertain you thro' the reſt of this Paper, it ſhould be ſpotted and diverſified with Conceits all over; you ſhould be put out of breath with Laughter at each Sentence, and pauſe at each Period, to look back over how much Wit you had paſs'd. But I have found by experience, that people now-adays regard Writing as little as they do Preaching: The moſt we can hope is to be heard, juſt with Decency and Patience, once a week, by Folks in the Country: Here in Town we hum over a piece of fine Writing, and we whiſtle at a Sermon. The Stage is the only place we ſeem alive at; there indeed we ſtare, and roar, and clap hands for K. <hi>George</hi> and the Government. As for all other Virtues but this Loyalty, they are an obſolete Train, ſo ill-dreſs'd, that Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hiſs 'em out of all good Company. Humility knocks ſo ſneakingly at the door,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0096900402:137"/>
that every Footman out-raps it, and makes it give way to the free Entrance of Pride, Prodigality, and Vain-glory.</p>
                  <p>My Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> from having ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in your Company too long, really behaves herſelf ſcandalouſly among us: She pretends to open her eyes for the ſake of ſeeing the Sun, and to ſleep becauſe it is Night; drinks Tea at nine in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is thought to have ſaid her Prayers before; talks without any manner of ſhame of good Books, and has not ſeen <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Play of the <hi>Non-juror.</hi> I rejoyced the other day to ſee a Libel on her Toilette, which gives me ſome hope that you have at leaſt a Taſte of Scandal left you, in defect of all other Vices.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole matter, I heartily wiſh you well; but as I cannot entirely deſire the ruin of all the Joys of this City, ſo all that remains is to wiſh you wou'd keep your Happineſs to yourſelves, that the happieſt here may not die with Envy at a Bliſs which they cannot attain to.</p>

                  <p>YOU'LL think me very full of my ſelf, when after a long Silence (which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0096900402:138"/>
however to ſay truth has rather been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to contemplate of you, than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you I begin to talk of my own Works. I find it is in the Finiſhing a Book, as in concluding a Seſſion of Parliament, one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thinks it will be very ſoon, and finds it very late. There are many unlook'd-for Incidents to retard the Clearing <hi>any publick Account,</hi> and ſo I ſee it is in mine. I have plagued my ſelf, like great Miniſters, with undertaking too much for one Man, and with a Deſire of doing more than was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me, have done leſs than I ought.</p>
                  <p>For having deſign'd Four very laborious and uncommon ſorts of Indexes to <hi>Homer,</hi> I'm forc'd, for want of time, to publiſh two only; the deſign of which you will own to be pretty, tho' far from being fully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. I've alſo been oblig'd to leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſh'd in my desk the Heads of two Eſſays, one on the <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> and another on the <hi>Oratory</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> So they muſt wait for future Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or periſh; and (one way or other, no great matter which) <hi>dabit Deus his quoque finem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think of you every day, I aſſure you, even without ſuch good Memorials of you as your Siſters, with whom I ſometimes talk of you, and find it one of the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of all ſubjects to them. My Lord

                     <hi>Digby</hi> muſt be perpetually remember'd by all who ever knew him, or knew his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. There needs no more than an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with your Family, to make all Elder Sons wiſh they had Fathers to their lives end.</p>
                  <p>I can't touch upon the ſubject of filial Love, without putting you in mind of an old Woman, who has a ſincere, hearty, old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhion'd reſpect for you, and conſtantly blames her Son for not having writ to you oftner, to tell you ſo.</p>
                  <p>I very much wiſh (but what ſignifies my wiſhing? my Lady <hi>Scudamore</hi> wiſhes, your Siſters wiſh) that you were with us, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the beautiful Contraſte this Seaſon affords us, of the Town and the Country. No Ideas you could form in the Winter can make you imagine what <hi>Twickenham</hi> is (and what your Friend Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> of <hi>Twickenham</hi> is) in this warmer Seaſon. Our River glitters beneath an unclouded Sun, at the ſame time that its Banks retain the Verdure of Showers: Our Gardens are offering their firſt Noſegays; our Trees, like new Acquaintance brought happily together, are ſtretching their Arms to meet each other, and growing nearer and nearer every hour: The Birds are paying their thankſgiving Songs for the new Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations I have made 'em: My Building riſes high enough to attract the eye and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0096900402:140"/>
curioſity of the Paſſenger from the River, where, upon beholding a mixture of Beauty and Ruin, he enquires what houſe is falling, or what Church is riſing? So little taſte have our common Tritons of <hi>Vitruvius;</hi> whatever delight the true, unſeen, poetical Gods of the River may take, in reflecting on their Streams my <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Porticos, or <hi>Ionic</hi> Pilaſters.</p>
                  <p>But (to deſcend from all this Pomp of Style) the beſt account I can give of what I am building, is, that it will afford me a few pleaſant Rooms for ſuch a Friend as yourſelf, or a cool ſituation for an hour or two for Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> when ſhe will do me the honour (at this Publick Houſe on the Road) to drink her own Cyder.</p>
                  <p>The moment I am writing this, I am ſurprized with the account of the Death of a Friend of mine; which makes all I have here been talking of, a meer Jeſt!

                  <p>YOUR Doctor is going to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and ſtays a Fortnight or more: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you would be comforted to have a Sight of him, whether you need him or not. I think him as good a Doctor as any for one that is ill, and a better Doctor than any for one that is well. He would do admirably for Mrs. <hi>Mary Digby:</hi> She needed only to follow his Hints, to be in eternal buſineſs and amuſement of mind, and even as active as ſhe could deſire. But indeed I fear ſhe would out-walk him: For (as Dean <hi>Swift</hi> obſerv'd to me the very firſt time I ſaw the Doctor) <hi>He is a Man that can do every thing, but walk.</hi> His Brother, who is lately come into <hi>England,</hi> goes alſo to the <hi>Bath;</hi> and is a more extraordinary Man than he, worth your going thither on purpoſe to know him. The Spirit of <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> ſo long dead to our World, is reviv'd in him: He is a Philoſopher all of fire; ſo warmly, nay ſo wildly in the right, that he forces all others about him to be ſo too, and draws them into his own <hi>Vortex.</hi> He is a Star that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0096900402:144"/>
looks as if it were all Fire, but is all Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, all gentle and beneficial Influence. If there be other men in the world that would ſerve a Friend, yet He is the only one I believe that could make even an Enemy ſerve a Friend.</p>
                  <p>As all human Life is chequer'd and mixed with Acquiſitions and Loſſes (tho' the latter are more certain and irremediable, than the former laſting or ſatisfactory) ſo at the time I have gain'd the acquaintance of one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Man I have loſt another, a very eaſy, humane, and gentlemanly Neighbour, Mr. <hi>Stonor.</hi> It's certain the Loſs of one of this Character puts us naturally upon ſetting a greater Value on the few that are left, tho' the degree of our Eſteem may be different. Nothing, ſays <hi>Seneca,</hi> is ſo melancholy a circumſtance in human life, or ſo ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles us to the thought of our own death, as the reflection and proſpect of one Friend after another dropping round us!

                  <p>YOUR making a ſort of Apology for your not writing, is a very genteel reproof to me. I know I was to blame, but I know I did not intend to be ſo, and (what is the happieſt Knowledge in the World) I know you will forgive me: For ſure nothing is more ſatisfactory than to be certain of ſuch a Friend as will overlook one's failings, ſince every ſuch inſtance is a Conviction of his Kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>If I am all my life to dwell in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and never to riſe to Actions, I have but too much need of that gentle diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I experience in you. But I hope better things of myſelf, and fully purpoſe to make you a viſit this Summer at <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn.</hi> I'm told you are all upon removal very ſpeedily, and that Mrs. <hi>Mary Digby</hi> talks in a Letter to Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> of ſeeing my Lord <hi>Bathurſt</hi>'s Wood in her way. How much I wiſh to be her Guide thro' that enchanted Foreſt, is not to be expreſt: I look upon myſelf as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian appropriated to the place, without whom no mortal can penetrate into the Receſſes of thoſe ſacred Shades. I could paſs whole Days, in only deſcribing to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0096900402:148"/>
her the future, and as yet viſionary Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that are to riſe in thoſe Scenes: The Palace that is to be built, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villions that are to glitter, the Colonnades that are to adorn them: Nay more, the meeting of the <hi>Thames</hi> and the <hi>Severn,</hi> which (when the noble Owner has finer Dreams than ordinary) are to be led into each other's Embraces thro' ſecret Caverns of not above twelve or fifteen Miles, till they riſe and openly celebrate their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the midſt of an immenſe Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre, which is to be the Admiration of Poſterity a hundred Years hence. But till the deſtin'd time ſhall arrive that is to manifeſt theſe Wonders, Mrs. <hi>Digby</hi> muſt content herſelf with ſeeing what is at preſent no more than the fineſt Wood in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Objects that attract this part of the world, are of a quite different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Women of Quality are all turn'd Followers of the <hi>Camp</hi> in <hi>Hyde-Park</hi> this Year, whither all the Town reſort to magnificent Entertainments given by the Officers, &amp;c. The <hi>Scythian</hi> Ladies that dwelt in the Waggons of War, were not more cloſely attached to the Luggage. The Matrons, like thoſe of <hi>Sparta,</hi> attend their Sons to the Field, to be the Witneſſes of their glorious Deeds; and the Maidens
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0096900402:149"/>
with all their Charms diſplay'd, provoke the Spirit of the Soldiers: Tea and Coffee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> black Broth. This Camp ſeems crowned with perpetual Victory, for every Sun that riſes in the Thunder of Cannon, ſets in the Muſick of Violins. Nothing is yet wanting but the conſtant preſence of the <hi>Princeſs,</hi> to repreſent the <hi>Mater Exercitûs.</hi>

                  <p>At <hi>Twickenham</hi> the World goes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. There are certain old People who take up all my time, and will hardly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to keep any other Company. They were introduced here by a Man of their own ſort, who has made me perfectly rude to all my Contemporaries, and won't ſo much as ſuffer me to look upon 'em. The Perſon I complain of is the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> Yet he allows me (from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he has heard of your Character and that of your Family, as if you were of the old Sect of Moraliſts) to write three or four ſides of Paper to you, and to tell you (what theſe ſort of People never tell but with Truth, and religious Sincerity) that I am, and ever will be,</p>

                  <p>THE ſame reaſon that hinder'd your writing, hinder'd mine, the pleaſing Expectation to ſee you in Town. Indeed ſince the willing Confinement I have lain under here with my Mother, (whom it is natural and reaſonable I ſhould rejoice with as well as grieve) I could the better bear your Abſence from <hi>London,</hi> for I could hardly have ſeen you there; and it would not have been quite reaſonable to have drawn you to a ſick Room hither from the firſt Embraces of your Friends. My Mother is now (I thank God) wonderfully recovered, tho' not ſo much as yet to venture out of her Chamber, yet enough to enjoy a few particular Friends, when they have the good Nature to look upon her. I may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you the Room we ſit in, upon one (and that a favourite) Account, that it is the very <hi>warmeſt</hi> in the Houſe: We and our Fires will equally ſmile upon your Face. There is a <hi>Perſian</hi> Proverb that ſays, I think very prettily, <hi>The Converſation of a Friend brightens the Eyes.</hi> This I take to be a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0096900402:151"/>
Splendor ſtill more agreeable than the Fires you ſo delightfully deſcribe.</p>
                  <p>That you may long enjoy your own Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, in the metaphorical Senſe, that is, all thoſe of your Family who make it pleaſing to ſit and ſpend whole wintry Months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, (a far more rational Delight, and better felt by an honeſt Heart, than all the glaring Entertainments, numerous Lights, and falſe Splendors, of an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of empty Heads, aking Hearts, and falſe Faces) This is my ſincere Wiſh to you and yours.</p>
                  <p>You ſay you propoſe much Pleaſure in ſeeing ſome few <hi>Faces</hi> about Town of my Acquaintance, I gueſs you mean Mrs. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>'s and Mrs. <hi>Blount</hi>'s.

                  <p>A Fever carry'd me on the high Gallop towards it for ſix or ſeven days—But here you have me now, and that's all I ſhall ſay of it: Since which time an impertinent Lameneſs kept me at home twice as long; as if Fate ſhould ſay (after the other danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Illneſs) <q rend="inline">"You ſhall neither go into the other World, nor any where you like in this."</q> Elſe who knows but I had been at <hi>Hom-lacy?</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0096900402:160"/>
a Life as you have been long accuſtomed to lead. As for Good Works, they are things I dare not name, either to thoſe that do them, or to thoſe that do them not; the firſt are too modeſt, and the latter too ſelfiſh, to bear the mention of what are become either too old-faſhion'd, or too private, to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute any Part of the Vanity or Reputation of the preſent Age. However, it were to be wiſh'd People would now and then look upon Good Works as they do upon old Wardrobes, meerly in caſe any of'em ſhould by chance come into Faſhion again; as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fardingales revive in modern Hoop'd Petticoats, (which may be properly compar'd to Charities, as they cover a multitude of Sins.)</p>
                  <p>They tell me that at—certain anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Charities, and obſolete Devotions are yet ſubſiſting: That a thing called Chriſtian Chearfulneſs, (not incompatible with <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Pyes and Plum-broth) whereof frequent is the mention in old Sermons and Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks, is really kept alive and in Practiſe: That feeding the Hungry, and giving Alms to the Poor, do yet make a Part of good Houſe-keeping, in a Latitude not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from <hi>London</hi> than fourſcore Miles: And laſtly, that Prayers and Roaſt-beef actually make ſome People as happy, as a Whore and a Bottle. But here in Town
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0096900402:161"/>
I aſſure you, Men, Women, and Children have done with theſe things. Charity not only begins, but ends, at home. Inſtead of the four Cardinal Virtues, now reign four Princely ones: We have Cunning for Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Rapine for Juſtice, Time-ſerving for Fortitude, and Luxury for Temperance.

                  <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  <p>I Know of nothing that will be ſo Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſing to you at preſent, as ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the laſt Act of that eminent Comick Poet, and our Friend, <hi>Wycherley.</hi> He had often told me, as I doubt not he did all his Acquaintance, that he would Marry as ſoon as his life was deſpair'd of. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly a few days before his Death he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the Ceremony; and join'd together thoſe two Sacraments which wiſe Men ſay ſhould be the laſt we receive; For if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Matrimony is plac'd after Extreme
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0096900402:164"/>
Unction in our Catechiſm, as a kind of Hint of the Order of Time in which they are to be taken. The old Man then lay down, ſatisfy'd in the Conſcience of having, by this one Act paid his juſt Debts, obliged a Woman who (he was told had) Merit, and ſhewn an heroick reſentment of the ill uſage of his next Heir. Some hundred pounds which he had with the Lady, diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Debts; a Jointure of four hundred a year made her a Recompenſe; and the Nephew he left to comfort himſelf as well as he could, with the miſerable Remains of a mortgaged Eſtate. I ſaw our Friend twice after this was done, leſs peeviſh in his Sickneſs than he uſed to be in his Health; neither much afraid of Dying, nor (which in him had been more likely) much aſhamed of Marrying. The Evening before he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he called his young Wife to the bed ſide, and earneſtly entreated her not to deny him one requeſt, the laſt he ſhould make. Upon her Aſſurances of conſenting to it, he told her, <hi>My Dear, it is only this; that you will never marry an old Man again.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help remarking, that Sickneſs which often deſtroys both Wit and Wiſdom, yet ſeldom has power to remove that Talent which we call <hi>Humour:</hi> Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> ſhew'd his, even in this laſt Compliment; tho' I think his requeſt a little hard; for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0096900402:165"/>
why ſhould he bar her from doubling her Jointure on the ſame eaſy Terms?</p>
                  <p>So trivial as theſe Circumſtances are, I ſhould not be diſpleas'd my ſelf to know ſuch Trifles, when they concern or charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſe any eminent Perſon. The wiſeſt and wittieſt of Men are ſeldom wiſer or wittier than others in theſe ſober Moments. At leaſt, our Friend ended much in the Character he had lived in: And <hi>Horace</hi>'s Rule for a Play, may as well be apply'd to him as a Playwright,

                  <p>I Am juſt return'd from the Country, whither Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> accompanied me, and paſs'd a Week in the Foreſt. I need not tell you how much a Man of his Turn entertain'd me; but I muſt acquaint you there is a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity and Gaiety of Diſpoſition almoſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to him, which make it impoſſible to part from him without that uneaſineſs which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0096900402:166"/>
generally ſucceeds all our pleaſures. I have been juſt taking a ſolitary walk by Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, full of reflections on the tranſitory na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all human delights; and giving my Thoughts a looſe in the contemplation of thoſe Satisfactions which probably we may hereafter taſte in the Company of ſeparate Spirits, when we ſhall range the Walks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and perhaps gaze on this World at as vaſt a diſtance as we now do on thoſe Worlds. The pleaſures we are to enjoy in that Converſation muſt undoubtedly be of a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Diſcoveries each ſhall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to another, of God and of Nature; for the Happineſs of Minds can ſurely be nothing but Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The higheſt Gratification we receive here from Company is <hi>Mirth,</hi> which at the beſt is but a fluttering unquiet Motion, that beats about the breaſt for a few moments, and after leaves it void and empty.</p>
                  <p>Keeping good Company, even the beſt, is but a leſs ſhameful Art of loſing Time.</p>
                  <p>What we here call <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Study,</hi> are little better: The greater number of Arts to which we apply ourſelves are mere Grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Dark; and even the ſearch of our moſt important Concerns in a future being, is but a needleſs, anxious, and uncertain haſte to be knowing, ſooner than we can,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0096900402:167"/>
what without all this ſollicitude we ſhall know a little later. We are but <hi>Curious Impertinents</hi> in the caſe of Futurity. 'Tis not our buſineſs to be gueſſing what the State of Souls ſhall be, but to be doing what may make our own State happy; We cannot be Knowing, but we can be Virtuous.</p>
                  <p>If this be my Notion of a great part of that high Science, Divinity; you will be ſo civil as to imagine I lay no mighty Streſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reſt. Even of my darling Poetry I really make no other uſe, than Horſes of the Bells that gingle about their ears (tho' now and then they toſs their Heads as if they were proud of 'em) only to Jogg on a little more merrily.</p>
                  <p>Your Obſervations on the narrow concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mankind in the point of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, confirm me in what I was ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as at my firſt knowledge of you to hope, and ſince ſo amply to experience. Let me take ſo much decent Pride and Dignity upon me, as to tell you, that but for Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons like theſe, which I diſcover'd in your Mind, I had never made the Trial I have done; which has ſucceeded ſo much to mine, and I believe not leſs to your Satisfaction: For if I know you right, your Pleaſure is greater in obliging me, than I can feel on my part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</p>

Your Remark, that the Variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Politicks or Religion is often rather a Gratification, than Objection, to people who have Senſe enough to conſider the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful order of Nature in her Variations; makes me think you have not conſtrued <hi>Joannes Secundus</hi> wrong, in the Verſe which precedes that which you quote: <hi>Bene nota Fides,</hi> as I take it, does no way ſignify the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Religion, tho' <hi>Secundus</hi> was of it. I think it was a generous thought, and one that flow'd from an exalted mind, that it was not improbable but God might be delighted with the various methods of worſhipping him, which divided the whole World. I am pretty ſure You and I ſhould no more make good <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Tyrants in Faith, than we could have been qualify'd for <hi>Lictors</hi> to <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> when he converted refractory Members with the Rack. In a word, I can only repeat to you what I think I have formerly ſaid; that I as little fear God will damn a Man who has Charity, as I hope that any Prieſt can ſave him without it.</p>

                  <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  <p>I Find that a real concern is not only a Hindrance to Speaking, but to Writing too: The more time we give our ſelves to think over one's own, or a Friends unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the more unable we grow to expreſs the grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural to delay a Letter, at ſuch a Seaſon as this, as to retard a melancholy Viſit to a Perſon one cannot relieve. One is aſhamed in that Circumſtance, to pretend to entertain people with trifling, inſignificant affectations of Sorrow on the one hand, or unſeaſonable and forced Gayeties on the other. 'Tis a kind of profanation of things ſacred; to treat ſo ſolemn a matter as a generous vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Suffering, with Compliments or Heroic Gallantries. Such a Mind as your's has no need of being Spirited up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Honour, or like a weak Woman, Praiſed into an opinion of its own Virtue. 'Tis enough to do and ſuffer what we ought; and Men ſhould know, that the noble pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Suffering bravely is as far above that of Enterprizing greatly, as an unblemiſh'd Conſcience and inflexible Reſolution are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0096900402:170"/>
an accidental Flow of Spirits, or a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Tide of Blood. If the whole Religious Buſineſs of Mankind be included in Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Maker, and Charity to our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Creatures; there are now ſome People who give us the Opportunity of affording as bright an Example in practiſing the one, as themſelves have given an infamous Inſtance of the Violation of the other. Whoever is really brave, has always this Comfort when he is oppreſt, that he knows himſelf to be ſuperior to thoſe who injure him: For the greateſt Power on Earth can no ſooner do him that Injury, but the brave Man can make himſelf greater by forgiving it.</p>
                  <p>If it were generous to ſeek for allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Conſolations in a Calamity of ſo much Glory, one might ſay that to be ruin'd thus in the Groſs, with a whole People, is but like periſhing in the General Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where nothing we can value is leſt behind us.</p>
                  <p>Methinks in our preſent Condition, the moſt heroic thing we are left capable of doing, is to endeavour to lighten each others Load, and (oppreſt as we are) to ſuccour ſuch as are yet more oppreſt. If there are too many who cannot be aſſiſted but by what we cannot give, our Money, there are yet others who may be relieved by our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, by our Countenance, and even by our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0096900402:171"/>
Chearfulneſs. The Misfortunes of private Families, the Miſunderſtandings of People whom Diſtreſſes make ſuſpicious, the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Relations whom Change of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may diſ-unite, or the Neceſſities of half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruin'd Eſtates render unkind to each other; theſe at leaſt may be ſoften'd in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by a general well-manag'd Humanity among ourſelves, if all thoſe who have your Principles of Belief, had alſo your Senſe and Conduct. But indeed moſt of 'em have given lamentable <note n="†" place="bottom">This was written in the Year of the Affair of <hi>Preſton.</hi>
                     </note> proofs of the contrary; and 'tis to be apprehended that they who want Senſe, are only religious thro' weakneſs, and good-natur'd thro' Shame: Theſe are narrow-minded Creatures that never deal in Eſſentials; their Faith never looks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Ceremonials, nor their Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Relations. As poor as I am, I would gladly relieve any diſtreſſed, conſcientious <hi>French</hi> Refugee at this inſtant: what muſt my Concern then be, when I perceive ſo many Anxieties now tearing thoſe Hearts which I have deſired a place in, and Clouds of Melancholy riſing on thoſe Faces which I have long look'd upon with Affection? I begin already to feel both what ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and what others are yet too ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0096900402:172"/>
to apprehend. I grieve with the Old, for ſo many additional Inconveniencies, and Chagrins, more than their ſmall Remain of Life ſeem'd deſtin'd to undergo; andwith the Young, for ſo many of thoſe Gayeties and Pleaſures (the Portion of Youth) which they will by this means be depriv'd of. This brings into my mind one or other of thoſe I love beſt, and among them the Widow and Fatherleſs, late of—As I am certain no People living had an earlier and truer Senſe of others Misfortunes, or a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſignation as to what might be their own; ſo I earneſtly wiſh, that whatever part they muſt bear may be render'd as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to them as it is in the power of any Friend to make it.</p>
                  <p>But I know you have prevented me in this Thought, as you always will in any thing that's good, or generous: I find by a a Letter of your Lady's (which I have ſeen) that their Eaſe and Tranquility is part of your Care. I believe there's ſome Fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in it, that you ſhould always, from time to time, be doing thoſe particular things that make me enamour'd of you.</p>
                  <p>I write this from <hi>Windſor</hi> Foreſt, of which I am come to take my laſt look. We here bid our Neighbours adieu, much as thoſe who go to be hang'd do their Fellow-Priſoners, who are condemn'd to follow

                  <p>IF a Regard both to Publick and Private Affairs may plead a lawful Excuſe in behalf of a negligent Correſpondent, I have really a very good Title to it: I cannot ſay
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0096900402:174"/>
whether 'tis a Felicity or Unhappineſs, tha I am obliged at this time to give up my whole Application to <hi>Homer;</hi> when without that Employment, my Thoughts muſt turn upon what is leſs agreeable, the Violence, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Reſentment of modern War-makers, which are likely to prove (to ſome People at leaſt) more fatal, than the ſame Qualities in <hi>Achilles</hi> did to his unfortunate Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the change of my Scene of Life, from <hi>Windſor</hi> Foreſt to the Side of the <hi>Thames,</hi> be one of the grand <hi>Aera's</hi> of my days, and may be called a notable Period in ſo inconſiderable a Hiſtory; yet you can ſcarce imagine any Hero paſſing from one Stage of Life to another, with ſo much Tranquillity, ſo eaſy a Tranſition, and ſo laudable a Behaviour. I am become ſo truly a Citizen of the World (according to <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s Expreſſion) that I look with equal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference on what I have loſt, and on what I have gained. The Times and Amuſements paſt are not more like a Dream to me, than thoſe which are preſent: I lie in a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind of Inaction, and have one Comfort at leaſt from Obſcurity, that the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> helps me to <hi>ſleep</hi> the better. I now and then reflect upon the Enjoyment of my Friends, whom I fancy I remember much as ſeparate Spirits do us, at tender Intervals,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0096900402:175"/>
neither interrupting their own Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor altogether careleſs of ours: but in general conſtantly wiſhing us well, and hoping to have us one day in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>To grow indifferent to the World is to grow Philoſophical, or Religious; (which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of thoſe Turns we chance to take) and indeed the World is ſuch a thing as one that thinks pretty much, muſt either laugh at, or be angry with: But if we laugh at it, they ſay we are proud; and if we are angry with it, they ſay we are ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd. So the moſt politic Way is to ſeem always better pleas'd than one can be, greater Admirers, greater Lovers, and in ſhort greater Fools, than we really are: So ſhall we live comfortably with our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, quietly with our Neighbours, favour'd by our Maſters, and happy with our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0096900402:176"/>
well in it: And I hope you have received your Reward, in being happy where you are.

                  <p>But I had a melancholy hint the other day, as if you were yet a Martyr to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue your Virtue made you undergo on this ſide the Water. I beg if your health be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to you, not to deny me the Joy of knowing it: Your endeavours of Service and good Advices to the poor Papiſts, put me in mind of <hi>Noah</hi>'s preaching forty years to thoſe folks that were to be drowned at laſt.

                  <p>I have very lately read <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> (to whom your <hi>Cornwall</hi> is not a little beholden) in the Tranſlation of a Clergyman
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0096900402:177"/>
in my neighbourhood. The poor Man is highly concerned to vindicate <hi>Jeffery</hi>'s vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as an Hiſtorian; and told me he was perfectly aſtoniſhed, we of the <hi>Roman</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion could doubt of the Legends of his Giants, while we believ'd thoſe of our Saints? I am forced to make a fair Compoſition with him; and, by crediting ſome of the wonders of <hi>Corinaeus</hi> and <hi>Gogmagog,</hi> have brought him ſo far already, that he ſpeaks reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s carrying Chriſt, and the Reſuſcitation of St. <hi>Nicholas Tolentine</hi>'s Chickens. Thus we proceed apace in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting each other from all manner of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> are no more; compared to <hi>Corinaeus</hi> and <hi>Arthur,</hi> than the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Ghibellines</hi> were to the <hi>Mohocks</hi> of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreadful memory.

He had liv'd in ſuch a Courſe of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance as was enough to make the longeſt Life agreeable to him, and in ſuch a Courſe of Piety as ſuffic'd to make the moſt ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Death ſo alſo. Sudden indeed it was: However, I heartily beg of God to give me ſuch an one, provided I can lead ſuch a Life. I leave him to the Mercy of God, and to the Piety of a Religion that extends beyond the Grave: <hi>Si qua eſt ea cura,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He has left me to the tickliſh Management of a narrow Fortune, where every falſe Step is dangerous. My Mother is in that diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited State of Reſignation, which is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of long Life, and the Loſs of what is dear to us.

                  <p>YOUR kind Letter has overtaken me here, for I have been in and about this Country ever ſince your departure. I am pleas'd to date this from a place ſo well known to Mrs. <hi>Blount,</hi> where I write as if I were dictated by her Anceſtors, whoſe faces are all upon me. I fear none ſo much as Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Guiſe,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Shirt, ſeems as ready to combate me, as her own Sir <hi>John</hi> was to demoliſh Duke <hi>Lancaſtere.</hi> I dare ſay your Lady will recollect his Figure. I look'd upon the Manſion, Walls, and Terraces; the Plantations, and Slopes, which Nature has made to command a variety of Vallies and riſing Woods; with a Veneration mixt with a Pleaſure, that repreſented her to me in thoſe puerile Amuſements, which engaged her ſo many Years ago in this place: I fancy'd I ſaw her ſober over a Sampler, or gay over a joynted Baby. I dare ſay ſhe did one thing more, even in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0096900402:181"/>
thoſe early times; <hi>remember'd her Creator in the Days of her Youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You deſcribe ſo well your Heremitical ſtate of life, that none of the ancient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorites could go beyond you, for a Cave in a Rock, with a fine Spring, or any of the Accommodations that befit a Solitary. Only I don't remember to have read, that any of thoſe venerable and holy Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges took with them a Lady, and begat Sons and Daughters. You muſt modeſtly be content to be accounted a Patriarch. But were you a little younger, I ſhould rather rank you with Sir <hi>Amadis,</hi> and his fellows. If Piety be ſo Romantick, I ſhall turn Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in good earneſt; for I ſee one may go ſo far as to be Poetical, and hope to ſave one's Soul at the ſame time. I really wiſh myſelf ſomething more, that is, a Prophet; for I wiſh I were as <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> to be taken by the Hair of the Head, and viſit <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Den. You are very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging in ſaying, I have now a whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily upon my hands, to whom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the part of a Friend: I aſſure you I like 'em all ſo well, that I will never quit my Hereditary Right to them; you have made me yours, and conſequently them mine. I ſtill ſee them walking on my Green at <hi>Twickenham,</hi> and gratefully remember (not

only their green Gowns) but the Inſtructions they gave me how to ſlide down, and trip up the ſteepeſt Slopes of my Mount.</p>

                  <p>YOUR very kind and obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of enquiring after me, among the firſt concerns of Life, at your Reſuſcitation, ſhould have been ſooner anſwer'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd. I ſincerely rejoice at your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from an Illneſs which gave me leſs pain than it did you, only from my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it. I ſhould have elſe been ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and deeply affected, in the thought of your danger by a Fever. I think it a fine and a natural thought, which I lately read in a private Letter of <hi>Montaigne,</hi> giving an account of the laſt words of an intimate Friend of his: <q rend="inline">'Adieu my Friend! the pain I feel will ſoon be over, but I grieve for
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0096900402:183"/>
that you are to feel, which is to laſt you for life.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I joyn with your Family in giving God thanks for lending us a worthy Man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer. The Comforts you receive from their Attendance put me in mind of what old <hi>Fletcher</hi> of <hi>Saltoune</hi> ſaid one day to me. <q rend="inline">'Alas, I have nothing to do but to dye; I am a poor Individual; no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to wiſh, or to fear, for my life or death: 'Tis the only reaſon I have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent being a ſingle Man; now I grow old, I am like a Tree without a Prop, and without young Trees of my own ſhedding, to grow round me, for Company and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope the Gout will ſoon go after the Fever, and all evil things remove far from you. But pray tell me, when will you move towards us? If you had an Interval to get hither, I care not what fixes you afterwards, except the Gout. Pray come, and never ſtir from us again. Do away your dirty Acres, caſt 'em to dirty People, ſuch as in the Scripture Phraſe <hi>poſſeſs the Land.</hi> Shake off your Earth like the noble Animal in <hi>Milton,</hi>

ſeriouſly (and of late I have met with ſo many Occaſions of thinking ſeriouſly, that I begin never to think otherwiſe) I cannot but think theſe things very idle; as idle, as if a Beaſt of Burden ſhou'd go on jingling his Bells, without bearing any thing valuable about him, or ever ſerving his Maſter.<q>

Temple, wholly compos'd of Shells in the Ruſtic Manner; and from that diſtance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Temple you look down thro' a ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arcade of Trees, and ſee the Sails on the River paſſing ſuddenly and vaniſhing, as thro' a Perſpective Glaſs. When you ſhut the Doors of this Grotto, it becomes on the inſtant, from a luminous Room, a <hi>Camera obſcura;</hi> on the Walls of which all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the River, Hills, Woods, and Boats, are forming a moving Picture in their viſible Radiations: And when you have a mind to light it up, it affords you a very different Scene: it is finiſhed with Shells interſperſed with Pieces of Looking-glaſs in angular forms; and in the Cieling is a Star of the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, at which when a Lamp (of an orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Figure of thin Alabaſter) is hung in the Middle, a thouſand pointed Rays glitter and are reflected over the Place. There are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected to this Grotto by a narrower Paſſage two Porches, with Niches and Seats; one toward the River, of ſmooth Stones, full of light and open; the other toward the Arch of Trees, rough with Shells, Flints and Iron Ore. The Bottom is paved with ſimple Pebble, as the adjoining Walk up the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to the Temple, is to be Cockle-ſhells, in the natural Taſte, agreeing not ill with the little dripping Murmur, and the Aquatic Idea of the whole Place.

                  <p>I Should be aſham'd to own the receipt of a very kind Letter from you, two whole Months from the date of this; if I were not

                  <p>I have had a Fever, a ſhort one, but a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent: I am now well. So it ſhall take up no more of this Paper.</p>
                  <p>I begin now to expect you in Town, to make the Winter to come more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us both. The Summer is a kind of Heaven, when we wander in a Paradiſaical Scene of Nature among Groves and Gardens; but at this Seaſon, we are like our poor firſt Parents turn'd out of that agreeable tho' ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, and forc'd to look about for more people to help to bear our labours, to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to warmer Houſes, and hive together in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>I hope you are long ſince perfectly reſtor'd and riſen from your Gout, happy in the delights of a contented Family, ſmiling at
 <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0096900402:191"/>
Storms, laughing at Greatneſs, and merry over a Chriſtmas-fire, exerciſing all the Functions of an old Patriarch in Charity and Hoſpitality. I will not tell Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> what I think ſhe is doing; for I conclude it is her opinion, that he only ought to know it for whom it is done: and ſhe will allow herſelf to be far enough advanc'd above a fine Lady, not to deſire to ſhine before Men.</p>
                  <p>Your Daughters perhaps may have ſome other thoughts, which even their Mother muſt excuſe them for, becauſe ſhe is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I will not however ſuppoſe thoſe thoughts get the better of their Devotions, but rather excite 'em, and aſſiſt the warmth of them; while their Prayer may be, that they may raiſe up and breed as irreproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a young Family as their Parents have done. In a Word, I fancy you all well, eaſy, and happy, juſt as I wiſh you; and next to that I wiſh you all with me.</p>
                  <p>Next to God, is a good Man: Next in dignity, and next in value. <hi>Minuiſti eum paullo minus ab Angelis.</hi> If therefore I wiſh well to the good and the deſerving, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire They only ſhould be my companions and Correſpondents; I muſt very ſoon, and very much think of you. I want your Company, and your Example. Pray make haſte to Town, ſo as not again to leave us: Diſcharge the Load of Earth that lies on you,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0096900402:192"/>
like one of the Mountains under which the Poets ſay the Giants (that is, the <hi>Men of the Earth)</hi> are whelmed: Leave Earth to the Sons of Earth; your Converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Which that it may be accompliſh'd in us all, is the Prayer of him who maketh this ſhort Sermon, Value (to you) Three Pence.</p>

                  <p>YOU writ me a very kind Letter ſome months ago, and told me you were then upon the point of taking a journey into <hi>Devonſhire.</hi> That hindered my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering you, and I have ſince ſeveral times inquir'd of you, without any ſatisfaction; for ſo I call the knowledge of your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, or of any thing that concerns you.

Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> too has been ſilent all this year; I believe he has been diſpleas'd at ſome or other of my Freedoms; which I very innocently take, and moſt with thoſe I think moſt my friends. But this I know nothing of, perhaps he may have open'd to you: And, if I know you right, you are of a Temper to cement Friendſhips, and not to divide them. I really much love Mr. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and have a true affection for your ſelf, which if I had any Intereſt in the world, or Power with thoſe who have, I ſhou'd not be long without manifeſting to you. I deſire you will not, either out of Modeſty, or a vicious Diſtruſt of another's value for you, (thoſe two Eternal Foes to Merit) imagine that your Letters and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation are not always welcome to me. There's no man more intirely fond of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature or ingenuity than myſelf, and I have ſeen too much of thoſe qualities in Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> to be any thing leſs than his</p>

                  <p>IT has been my good fortune within this Month paſt, to hear more things that have pleas'd me than (I think) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all my time beſide. But nothing upon my word has been ſo Home-felt a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as the News you tell me of your ſelf: and you are not in the leaſt miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when you congratulate me upon your own good Succeſs, for I have more People to be happy out of, than any ill-natur'd man can boaſt. I may with honeſty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to you, that notwithſtanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inconveniencies and Diſadvantages they commonly talk of in the <hi>Res anguſti domi,</hi> I have never found any other, than the inability of giving people of Merit the only certain proof of our value for them, in doing 'em ſome real ſervice.

                  <p>JUST as I receiv'd yours, I was ſet down to write to you with ſome ſhame that I had ſo long defer'd it. But I can hardly repent my neglect, when it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0096900402:198"/>

Every Corner of an Eye, or Turn of a Noſe or Ear, the ſmalleſt degree of Light or Shade on a Cheek, or in a dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have charms to diſtract me. I no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger look upon Lord <hi>Plauſible</hi> as ridiculous, for admiring a Lady's fine Tip of an Ear and pretty Elbow (as the <hi>Plain-dealer</hi> has it) but am in ſome danger even from the Ugly and Diſagreeable, ſince they may have their retired beauties, in one Trait or other about 'em. You may gueſs in how uneaſy a ſtate I am, when every day the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of others appear more beautiful and excellent, and my own more deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I have thrown away three Dr. <hi>Swift</hi>'s, each of which was once my Vanity, two Lady <hi>Bridgwaters,</hi> a Dutcheſs of <hi>Montague,</hi> beſides half a dozen Earls, and one Knight of the Garter. I have crucify'd <hi>Chriſt</hi> over-again in effigie, and made a <hi>Madona</hi> as old as her mother St. <hi>Anne.</hi> Nay, what is yet more miraculous, I have rival'd St. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf in Painting, and as 'tis ſaid

an Angel came and finiſh'd his Piece, ſo you would ſwear a Devil put the laſt hand to mine, 'tis ſo begrim'd and ſmut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. However I comfort my ſelf with a chriſtian Reflection, that, I have not broken the Commandment, for my Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are not the likeneſs of any thing in heaven above, or in earth below, or in the waters under the earth. Neither will any body adore or worſhip them, except the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould have a ſight of 'em, who they tell us, worſhip certain Pagods or Idols purely for their Uglineſs.</p>

I am glad your <hi>Fan</hi> is mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſoon, but I wou'd have you varniſh and glaze it at your leiſure, and poliſh the Sticks as much as you can.

to a few people who endeavour'd to ſerve you, and whoſe Politicks were never your Concern. If you are a <hi>Whig,</hi> as I rather hope, and as I think your Principles and mine (as Brother Poets) had ever a Byaſs to the Side of Liberty, I know you will be an honeſt man and an inoffenſive one. Upon the whole, I know you are incapable of being ſo much of either Party as to be good for nothing. Therefore once more, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are, or in whatever ſtate you are, all hail!</p>
                  <p>One or two of your old Friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd they had heard nothing from you ſince the <hi>Queen</hi>'s death; I told 'em, no man living loved Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> better than I, yet I had not once written to him in all his Voyage. This I thought a convincing proof, how truly one may be a friend to another without telling him ſo every month. But they had reaſons too themſelves to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in your excuſe, as men who really value one another will never want ſuch as make their friends and themſelves eaſy. The late univerſal Concern in publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, threw us all into a hurry of Spirits; even I who am more a Philoſopher than to expect any thing from any Reign, was born away with the current, and full of the expectation of the Succeſſor: During your Journeys I knew not whither to aim
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0096900402:206"/>
a letter after you, that was a ſort of ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flying: add to this the demand <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> had upon me, to write fifty Verſes a day, beſides learned Notes, all which are at a concluſion for this year. Rejoice with me, O my Friend, that my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is over; come and make merry with me in much Feaſting, for I to thee and thou to me. We will feed among the Lillies. By the Lillies I mean the Ladies, with whom I hope you have fed to ſatiety: Haſt thou paſſed through many Countries, and not taſted the delights thereof? Haſt thou not left of thy Iſſue in divers Lands, that <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Gays</hi> and <hi>Dutch Gays</hi> may ariſe, to write Paſtorals and ſing their Songs in ſtrange Countries?

                  <p>I AM extremely glad to find by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of yours to Mr. <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> that you have receiv'd one from me; and I beg you to keep, as the greateſt of Curioſities, that Letter of mine which you receiv'd and I never writ.</p>
                  <p>But the Truth is, that we were made here to expect you in a ſhort time, that I was upon the Ramble moſt part of the Summer, and have concluded the Seaſon in Grief, for the death of my poor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

I ſhall not enter into a detail of my Concerns and Troubles, for two reaſons; becauſe I am really afflicted and need no Airs of grief, and becauſe they are not the concerns and troubles of any but my ſelf. But I think you (without too great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment) enough my friend, to be pleas'd to know he died eaſily, without a groan, or the ſickneſs of two minutes; in a word, as ſilently and peacefully as he lived.<q>
                        <l>Sic mihi contingat vivere, ſicque mori!</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not in the humour to ſay gay things, nor in the affectation of avoiding them. I can't pretend to entertain either Mr. <hi>Pulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> or you, as you have done both my Lord <hi>Burlington</hi> and me, by your letter to Mr. <hi>Lowndes.</hi> I am only ſorry you have no greater quarrel to Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi> and wiſh you paid ſome hundreds a year to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax. That Gentleman is lately become an inoffenſive perſon to me too; ſo that we may join heartily in our addreſſes to him, and (like true Patriots) rejoice in all that Good done to the Nation and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which we contribute nothing our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not forget to acknowledge your letter ſent from <hi>Aix;</hi> you told me then that writing was not good with the Waters,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0096900402:209"/>
and I find ſince you are of my opinion, that 'tis as bad without the Waters. But I fancy, it is not writing but thinking, that is ſo bad with the Waters; and then you might write without any manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, if you writ like our Brother-poets of theſe days.</p>
                  <p>I have no ſtory to tell that is worth your hearing; you know I am no man of Intrigue; but the Ducheſs of <hi>Hamilton</hi> has one which ſhe ſays is worth my hearing, that relates to Mr. <hi>Pulteney</hi> and your ſelf; and which ſhe promiſes, if you won't tell me, ſhe will. Her Grace has won in a Raffle a very fine Tweezercaſe; at the ſight of which, my Tweezercaſe, and all other Tweezercaſes on the globe, <hi>Hide their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd Heads.</hi>

I would ſend my ſervices to Mr. <hi>Pulteney,</hi> but that he is out of favour at Court; and make ſome compliment to Mrs. <hi>Pulteney,</hi> if ſhe were not a Whig. My Lord <hi>Burlington</hi> tells me ſhe has as much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhin'd all the <hi>French</hi> Ladies, as ſhe did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> before: I am ſorry for it, becauſe it will be detrimental to our holy Religion, if heretical Women ſhould eclypſe thoſe

                  <p>I Think it obliging in you to deſire an account of my health. The truth is, I have never been in a worſe ſtate in my life, and find whatever I have try'd as a remedy ſo ineffectual, that I give myſelf entirely over. I wiſh your health may be ſet perfectly right by the Waters, and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd I not only wiſh that, and every thing elſe for you, as common friends wiſh, but with a Zeal not uſual among thoſe we call ſo. I am always glad to hear of, and from you; always glad to ſee you, whatever accidents or amuſements have interven'd to make me do either leſs than uſual. I not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently think of you, but conſtantly do my beſt to make others do it, by mentioning

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0096900402:212"/>
I find your Idea is ſo cloſely connected to me, that I muſt forget both together, or neither. I'm ſorry, I could not have a glympſe either of you, or of the Sun (your Father) before you went for <hi>Bath.</hi> But now it pleaſes me to ſee him, and hear of you. Pray put Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> in mind that he has one on this ſide of the World who loves him; and that there are more Men and Women in the Univerſe, than Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> and my Lady Dutcheſs of <hi>M.</hi> There are Ladies in and about <hi>Richmond</hi> that pretend to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue him and yourſelf; and one of 'em at leaſt may be thought to do it without Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, namely Mrs. <hi>Howard.</hi> As for Mrs. <hi>Blounts</hi> (whom you mercifully make mention of) they are gone, or going to <hi>Suſſex.</hi> I hope Mrs. <hi>Pulteney</hi> is the better for the Bath, tho' I have little Charity and few good Wiſhes for the Ladies, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of their beſt friends the Men. Pray tell her ſhe has forgot the firſt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I ever troubled her with, and therefore it ſhall be the laſt (the very thing I fear ſhe deſires.) Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> is a ſtrange creature; he goes out of town, and leaves his Baſtards at other folks doors. I have long been ſo far miſtaken in him as to think him a Man of Morals as well as of Politicks. Pray let him know I made a very unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable enquiry t'other day of the welfare

Pray tell Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> that even Pigeon-pyes and Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puddings are thought dangerous by our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors; for thoſe that have been ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> are open'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely pry'd into at the <hi>Tower:</hi> 'Tis the firſt time dead Pigeons have been ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of carrying Intelligence. To be ſerious, you, and Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> (nay and the Doctor if he has not dined) will be ſenſible of my concern and ſurprize at the commitment of that Gentleman, whoſe welfare is as much my concern as any Friend's I have. I think my ſelf a moſt unfortunate wretch; I no ſooner love, and, upon knowledge, fix my eſteem to any man; but he either dies like Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> or is ſent to Impriſonment like the Biſhop. God ſend him as well as I wiſh him, manifeſt him to be as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as I believe him, and make all his Enemies know him as well as I do, that

they may love him and think of him as well!</p>

was not, and is not leſſen'd, by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate apprehenſion I have now every day lain under of loſing my Mother. Be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, no Duty leſs than that, ſhould have kept me one day from attending your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: I would come and take a room by you at <hi>Hampſtead,</hi> to be with you daily, were ſhe not ſtill in danger of death. I have conſtantly had particular accounts of you from the Doctor, which have not ceas'd to alarm me yet. God preſerve your life, and reſtore your health. I really beg it for my own ſake, for I feel I love you more than I thought, in health, tho' I always lov'd you a great deal. If I am ſo unfortunate as to bury my poor Mother, and yet have the good fortune to have my prayers heard for you, I hope we may live moſt of our remaining days together. If, as I believe, the air of a better clime as the Southern Part of <hi>France</hi> may be thought uſeful for your recovery, thither I would go with you infallibly; and it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we might get the Dean with us, who is in that abandon'd ſtate already in which I ſhall ſhortly be, as to other Cares and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Dear <hi>Gay,</hi> be as chearful as your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings will permit: God is a better friend than a Court: Even any honeſt man is a better. I promiſe you my entire friendſhip

                  <p>I AM glad to hear of the progreſs of your recovery, and the oftner I hear it the better, when it becomes eaſy to you to give it me. I ſo well remember the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation you were to me in my Mother's former Illneſs, that it doubles my Concern at this time not to be able to be with you, or you able to be with me. Had I loſt her, I wou'd have been no where elſe but with you during your confinement. I have now paſt five weeks without once going from home, and without any company but ſor three or four of the days. Friends rarely ſtretch their kindneſs ſo far as ten miles. My Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> have not forgotten to viſit me: the reſt (except Mrs. <hi>Blount</hi> once) were contented to ſend meſſages. I never paſs'd ſo melancholy a time, and now Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s death touches me nearly. It is twenty years that I have known him. Every year carries away ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <p>IF my friendſhip were as effectual as it is ſincere, you would be one of thoſe people who would be vaſtly advantag'd and enrich'd by it. I ever honour'd thoſe Popes who were moſt famous for Nepotiſm, 'tis a ſign that the old fellows <hi>loved Somebody,</hi> which is not uſual in ſuch advanced years. And I now honour Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> for his extenſive Bounty and Goodneſs to his private Friends and Relations. But it vexes me to the heart when I reflect, that my friendſhip is ſo much leſs effectual than theirs; nay ſo utterly uſeleſs that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give you any thing, not even a Dinner, at this diſtance, nor help the General whom I greatly love to catch one fiſh. My on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſolation is to think you happier than myſelf, and to begin to envy you, which is next to hating (an excellent remedy for Love.) How comes it that Providence has been ſo unkind to me, (who am a greater object of compaſſion than any fat man alive) that I am forc'd to drink wine, while you

                  <p>I AM ſomething like the Sun at this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, withdrawing from the World, but meaning it mighty well, and reſolving to ſhine whenever I can again. But I fear the Clouds of a long Winter will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me to ſuch a degree, that any body will take a farthing candle for a better Guide, and more ſerviceable companion. My Friends may remember my brighter days, but will think (like the <hi>Iriſhman)</hi> that the <hi>Moon</hi> is a better thing when once I am gone. I don't ſay this with any alluſion to my Poetical capacity as a Son of <hi>Apollo,</hi> but in my Companionable one, (if you'll ſuffer me to uſe a phraſe of the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s) For I ſhall ſee or be ſeen of few of you, this Winter. I am grown too faint to do any good, or to give any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I not only, as <hi>Dryden</hi> fairly ſays, <hi>Feel my notes decay</hi> as a Poet, but feel my Spirits flag as a Companion, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to where I firſt began, my Books. I have been putting my Library in order, and enlarging the Chimney in it, with equal intention to warm my Mind and Body (if I can) to ſome Life. A Friend,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0096900402:231"/>
(a Woman-friend, God help me!) with whom I have ſpent three or four hours a day theſe fifteen years, adviſed me to paſs more time in my ſtudies: I reflected, ſhe muſt have found ſome Reaſon for this admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and concluded ſhe wou'd compleat all her kindneſſes to me by returning me to the Employment I am fitteſt for; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the dead, the old, and the worm-eaten.</p>
                  <p>Judge therefore if I might not treat you as a Beatify'd Spirit, comparing your life with my ſtupid ſtate. For as to my living at <hi>Windſor</hi> with Ladies, &amp;c. it is all a dream; I was there but two nights, and all the day out of that company. I ſhall certainly make as little Court to others, as they do to me; and that will be none at all. My Fair-Weather-Friends of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are going away for <hi>London,</hi> and I ſhall ſee Them and the Butterflies together, if I live till next year; which I would not deſire to do, if it were only for their ſakes. But we that are Writers, ought to love Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, that Poſterity may love us; and I would willingly live to ſee the Children of the preſent Race, meerly in hope they may be a little wiſer than their Parents.</p>

                  <p>I Am aſtoniſhed at the Complaints occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by a late <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Burlington;</hi> and I ſhould be afflicted were there the leaſt juſt Ground for 'em. Had the Writer attack'd <hi>Vice,</hi> at a Time when it is not only tolerated but triumphant, and ſo far from being conceal'd as a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> that it is proclaimed with Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a <hi>Merit;</hi> I ſhould have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the Conſequence: Had he ſatirized Gameſters of a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and pounds Fortune, acquired by ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as are in daily practice, and almoſt univerſally encouraged: Had he overwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended the <hi>Religion of his Country,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Books as come from every Preſs, are publickly vended in every Shop, and greedily bought by almoſt every Rank of Men; or had he called our excellent <hi>Weekly Writers</hi> by the ſame Names which they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly beſtow on the greateſt Men <hi>in</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and <hi>out</hi> of the Miniſtry, for which they are all unpuniſhed, and moſt rewarded:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0096900402:233"/>
In any of theſe Caſes, indeed, I might have judged him too preſumptuous, and perhaps have trembled for his Raſhneſs.</p>
                  <p>I could not but hope better for this ſmall and modeſt Epiſtle, which attacks <hi>no one Vice</hi> whatſoever; which deals only in <hi>Folly,</hi> and not Folly in general, but a ſingle Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of it; that only Branch, for the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Excellency to which, the Noble Lord to whom it is written muſt neceſſarily be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. I fancied it might eſcape Cenſure, eſpecially ſeeing how tenderly theſe Follies are treated, and really leſs accuſed, than Apologized for.<q>
                        <l>Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed,</l>
                        <l>Health to himſelf, and to his Infants Bread</l>
                        <l>The Lab'rer bears.</l>
                     </q> Is this ſuch a <hi>Crime,</hi> that to impute it to a Man muſt be a grievous Offence? 'Tis an <hi>Innocent Folly,</hi> and much more <hi>Beneficent</hi> than the Want of it; for <hi>Ill Taſte</hi> employs more hands, and diffuſes Expence more than a <hi>Good</hi> one. Is it a <hi>Moral</hi> Defect? No, it is but a <hi>Natural</hi> one; a <hi>Want of Taſte.</hi> It is what the beſt good Man living may be liable to: The worthieſt Peer may live ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily in an ill-favour'd Houſe, and the beſt reputed Citizen be pleaſed with a vile Garden. I thought (I ſay) the Author had
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0096900402:234"/>
the common Liberty to obſerve a Defect, and to compliment a Friend for a Quality that diſtinguiſhes him: which I know not how any Quality ſhould do, if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay the Satire is <hi>Perſonal.</hi> I thought it could not be ſo, becauſe all its Reflexions are on <hi>Things.</hi> His Reflexions are not on the <hi>Man,</hi> but his Houſe, Garden, &amp;c. Nay, he reſpects (as one may ſay) the <hi>Perſons</hi> of the Gladiator, Amphitheatre, the Nile, and the Triton: He is only ſorry to ſee them (as he might be to ſee any of his <hi>Friends)</hi> ridiculous, by being in the wrong Place, and in bad Company. Some fancy, that to ſay a Thing is <hi>Perſonal,</hi> is the ſame as to ſay it is <hi>Injuſt,</hi> not conſidering, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be <hi>Juſt</hi> that is not <hi>Perſonal.</hi> I am afraid that <q rend="inline">"all ſuch Writings and Diſcourſes as <hi>touch no Man,</hi> will <hi>mend no Man.</hi>"</q> The Good Natured, indeed, are apt to be alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at any thing like Satire; and the <hi>Guilty</hi> readily concur with the <hi>Weak</hi> for a plain Reaſon, becauſe the Vicious look upon Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as their <hi>Frontier:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>—J am proximus ar det</l>
                        <l>Ucalegon—</l>
                     </q>
No wonder thoſe who know Ridicule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, find an inward Conſolation
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0096900402:235"/>
in removing it from themſelves as far as they can; and it is never ſo far, as when they can get it fixed on the <hi>beſt Characters.</hi> No wonder thoſe who are Food for Satiriſts ſhould rail at them as Creatures of Prey; every Beaſt born for our Uſe would be ready to call a Man ſo.</p>
                  <p>I know no Remedy, unleſs people in our Age would as little frequent the Theatres, as they begin to do the Churches; unleſs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy were forſaken, Satire ſilent, and every man left to do what ſeems good in his own Eyes, as if there were no King, no Prieſt, no Poet, in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I find myſelf obliged to touch a Point, on which I muſt be more ſerious; it well deſerves I ſhould: I mean the malicious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Character of <hi>Timon,</hi> which I will boldly ſay, they would impute to the Perſon the moſt different in the World from a <hi>Man-hater,</hi> and the Perſon whoſe <hi>Taſte</hi> and <hi>Encouragement</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> have often been ſhewn in the <hi>righteſt Place.</hi> The Author of that Epiſtle muſt certainly think ſo, if he has the ſame Opinion of his own Merit as Authors generally have; for he has been favoured by this very Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Why, in God's Name, muſt a <hi>Portrait,</hi> apparently collected from twenty different Men, be apply'd to one only? Has it his <hi>Eye?</hi> No, it is very unlike. Has it his <hi>Noſe</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0096900402:236"/>
or <hi>Mouth?</hi> No, they are totally differing. What then, I beſeech you? Why, it has the <hi>Mole on his Chin.</hi> Very well; but muſt the Picture therefore be his, and has no other man that Blemiſh?</p>
                  <p>Could there be a more melancholy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance how much the Taſte of the Publick is vitiated, and turns the moſt ſalutary and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Phyſick into Poiſon, than if amidſt the Blaze of a thouſand bright Qualities in a Great Man, they ſhould only remark there is a <hi>Shadow</hi> about him, as what Eminence is without? I am confident the Author was incapable of imputing any ſuch to One, whoſe whole Life (to uſe his own Expreſſion in Print of him) is <hi>a continued Series</hi> of good and generous Actions.</p>
                  <p>I know no man who would be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, if he gave the leaſt Pain or Offence to any innocent perſon; and none who would be leſs concerned, if the Satire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it. If ever that happens, I dare engage he will own it, with all the Freedom of one whoſe <hi>Cenſures</hi> are <hi>juſt,</hi> and who ſets his <hi>Name</hi> to them.</p>

                  <p>THE Clamour rais'd about my Epiſtle to you, could not give me ſo much pain, as I receiv'd pleaſure in ſeeing the general Zeal of the world in the cauſe of a great Man who is Beneficent, and the particular Warmth of your Lordſhip in that of a private Man who is innocent.</p>
                  <p>It was not the <hi>Poem</hi> that deſerv'd this from you; for as I had the Honour to be your Friend, I cou'd not treat you quite like a Poet: but ſure the <hi>Writer</hi> deſerv'd more Candor, even from thoſe who knew him not, than to promote a Report, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that Noble Perſon was <hi>Impertinent;</hi> in regard to me, <hi>Villainous.</hi> Yet I had no great cauſe to wonder, that a Character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>twenty</hi> ſhou'd be applied to <hi>one;</hi> ſince, by that means, <hi>nineteen</hi> wou'd eſcape the Ridicule.</p>
                  <p>I was too well content with my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that Noble Perſon's Opinion in this Affair, to trouble the publick about it. But

ſince Malice and Miſtake are ſo long a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have taken the opportunity of a third Edition to declare <hi>His Belief,</hi> not only of <hi>My Innocence,</hi> but of <hi>Their Malignity,</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of which my own Heart is as conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as I fear ſome of theirs muſt be of the latter. His Humanity feels a Concern for the Injury done to <hi>Me,</hi> while His Greatneſs of Mind can bear with Indifference the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult offer'd to <hi>Himſelf.</hi>

This way of Satire is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as long as Slander rais'd by Fools of the loweſt Rank can find any countenance from thoſe of a Higher.

                  <p>I Little doubt of your kind Concern for me, nor of that of the Lady you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have nothing to repay my Friends with at preſent, but prayers and good wiſhes. I have the ſatisfaction to find that I am as officiouſly ſerv'd by my Friends, as he that has thouſands to leave in Legacies; beſides the Aſſurance of their Sincerity.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0096900402:240"/>
God Almighty has made my bodily diſtreſs as eaſy as a thing of that nature can be: I have found ſome relief, at leaſt ſometimes, from the Air of this Place. My Nights are bad, but many poor Creatures have worſe.</p>
                  <p>As for you, my good Friend, I think ſince our firſt acquaintance there has not been any of thoſe little Suſpicions or Jealouſies that often affect the ſincereſt Friendſhips; I am ſure not on my ſide. I muſt be ſo ſincere as to own, that tho' I could not help valuing you for thoſe Talents which the World prizes, yet they were not the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my Friendſhip: They were quite of another ſort; nor ſhall I at preſent offend you by enumerating them: And I make it my Laſt Requeſt, that you continue that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Diſdain</hi> and <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of Vice, which you ſeem naturally endu'd with, but ſtill with a due regard to your own Safety; and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more to reform than chaſtiſe, tho' the one often cannot be effected without the other.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Bathurſt</hi> I have always honour'd for every good Quality, that a Perſon of his Rank ought to have: Pray give my Reſpects and kindeſt Wiſhes to the Family.
