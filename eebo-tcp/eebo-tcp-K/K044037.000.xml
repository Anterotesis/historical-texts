            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ON THE EXTRACT OF LEAD.</head>
            <p>IT is not my intention here to deſcant on the praiſes of Mr. Goulard's remedy.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Goulard's work, ſold by P. Elmſly ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to Mr. Vaillant, Bookſeller in the Strand.</note> That is already too well known throughout Europe, to want any aſſiſtance from my pen. My views coincide entirely with thoſe of the author, in endeavouring to bring it to ſtill greater perfection, by conſidering it with more preciſeneſs both as to it's compoſition and uſe. To be ignorant of theſe would be a fault, willingly to conceal it's ſuperior virtues, would be an injury to ſociety, and a mannes of proceeding very different from the author's, who has publiſhed all his knowledge on the ſubject without reſerve.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0218201200:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>This medicament, juſtly looked upon by thoſe of the faculty, who are free from prejudice, as the beſt and moſt univerſal topic in ſurgery, may very properly be ſubſtituted in the place of all others generally preſcribed: it will frequently prove efficacious when the reſt have failed, and will repair the diſorders they have brought upon the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>I don't pretend to mention this medicine as a new diſcovered one, on the contrary, we have received it from antiquity, known by the name of <hi>Acetum Lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>argiri;</hi> but by its having been ill made, <hi>mal-a-propos</hi> applied, and preſcribed in improper quantities, it was for ſome time out of repute, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance and the vigilance of Mr. Goulard's ſpeculative turn, who has had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution enough to ſtem the torrent of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this remedy, like many others, by having been improperly made and as improperly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, would have fallen into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion only of the quacks. For want of proper vinegar the baſis of this medicine it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived the practitioners, who, from not knowing its properties and the real method of compoſing it, entirely laid it aſide. But it has of late been too minutely conſidered to be any longer neglected, and is now looked upon, by the impartial part of mankind, to be one of the greateſt ornaments of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſatories, as well as the moſt efficacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in ſurgery. It is then to Mr. Goulard, a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0218201200:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſkilful ſurgeon of Montpellier, we owe its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival; which could never have been effected, but by a man of his eminence, and like him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from vulgar prejudice, which has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to laid to the charge of this ſalutary remedy faults, from which the experiments of many famous in their profeſſion are now endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to clear it in favour of mankind.</p>
            <p>When this extract is made with natural vinegar, and the ſtrongeſt which can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the ſouth of France, where nature in favourable years, and in particular can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, furniſhes this vegetable liquor with more virtues, than any art of the vinegar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers can poſſibly endow it with, it poſſeſſes all the diſperſing, cooling, and reſolving qualities proper for dividing the glutinous ſtagnated matter in the obſtructed veſſels; it relaxes them when too much contracted, and reſtores to the ſolids and fluids the proportion of circulation neceſſary for preſerving the animal oeconomy in a ſtate of health. The common vinegars, owing their ſtrength to ſal armoniac, to pepper, and the dung of the feathered kind, which can't fail of robbing this extract of the qualities ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its perfection, as do likewiſe other factitious vegetable acids, ſuch for example, as are brewed in England, and in the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern countries, under the appearance of vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. The latter, 'tis true, tho' not capable of injuring the conſtitution, act as ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the ſtomach; but this property is not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0218201200:5"/>ſufficient to perfectly diſſolve the lead, or to impregnate theſe metallic particles with the particular qualities they acquire by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of tartar natural to thoſe vinegars, which are made with the ſtrongeſt wines.<note n="†" place="bottom">Such as are well verſed in the art of chymiſtry, know, that natural vinegar contains an eſſential oil which entirely diſſolves lead, while its acid only divides it's parts. Mr. Goulard has diſcovered that it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of ſome particular vinegars only of the province he lives in, to perfectly diſſolve this metal, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more eſſential oil than the reſt; conſequently natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vinegars, when adulterated, or factitious one, which receive their power of action from the acrid ingredients only mixed with them, are not only rendered incapable of perfectly diſſolving the lead, but likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate an inflammatory quality to the extract, very different from the cooling and calming one natural to it, when made with the beſt vinegar. The healing quality of lead is evident, from its happy effects, when applied in its natural ſtate even to ulcerated cancers; how much more efficaciouſly muſt it then act, when its ſaline particles are ſo far divided as to be capable of being introduced into the ſmalleſt veſſels, and there circulate with the juices? theſe they attenuate and divide, ſo as to return into their proper channel; it is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary then, that the vinegar; made uſe of for the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lead, ſhould be natural, well choſen, and by no means factitious. A chymical analyſis will eaſily diſcover the defects of vinegar; but, as every one is not in a ſituation of making theſe experiments, it's merits may be aſcertained by the taſte only. Good vinegar, when touched with the tongue, has a pleaſing acid taſte, and leaves a freſhneſs in the mouth, but when factitious rather appears to inflame the mouth, and throat, which ſenſation continues for ſome time.</note> I ſhall not here enter upon the bad qualities which may be conveyed to lead by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0218201200:6"/>made uſe of in the compoſition of factitious vinegars, which are brewed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every one's particular <hi>recipe.</hi> The beſt argument in favor of the extract of Saturn, made in particular parts of the ſouth of France, and againſt any other extract made with common vinegars, is, that the tartar of Languedoc has the preference in chymical proceſſes, ſome of which are in vain attempted without it. Another argument ſtill more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborative is that, at Montpellier alone good verdigreaſe can be procured, on account of the ſingular property of its vinegar, and for ſome other concurrent and unknown reaſons, which help to diſſolve the copper the baſis of the above drug. For the ſame reaſon we may be induced to think that the tartarous particles of the wine of that country, being refined by its change into vinegar, may contribute more efficaciouſly to diſſolve the lead, which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence daily proves. Common vinegars help only to divide it in parts, ſome of Languedoc pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly elected diſſolve it ſo thoroughly, that without any ſediment it preſerves its weight, a certain proof that it incorporates itſelf more with this ſpecies of vinegar, which no doubt muſt render it's effects more efficacious. It is certainly owing to this, that the medicine we ſpeak of poſſeſſes cooling, diſperſing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving qualities, and by no means a repelling one, as has been hinted by certain people. This requires an explanation, which will be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0218201200:7"/>eaſily underſtood by the meaneſt capacity, as I ſhall endeavour to expreſs myſelf in the plaineſt terms.</p>
            <p>When the lead is divided only, it's parts are too groſs and ponderous to remain ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the vegetable liquid its vehicle; this cauſes it to ſubſide: on ſhaking the bottle, they again incorporate with the liquid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering a diminution of their volume; this volume by preventing them from penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the veſſels tho' the pores of the ſkin cauſes them to remain in the tiſſue of thoſe parts, and, by ſtopping up the paſſages of perſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gives riſe to what is generally termed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion. But, when the metal is ſo far diſſolved, as always to remain ſuſpended in the vegetable liquid, its parts are ſo fine and ſo far attenuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as not to be diſcernable thro' the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect microſcope; they then eaſily penetrate the pores of the ſkin, follow the courſe of the perſpiratory veſſels, and put in motion the inſpiſſated and ſtagnated fluids, which they again return to the road of circulation. When the metallic particles act thus, the aquatic vehicles, with which they are combined, looſen the ſkin, which was before in a ſtate of too great tenſion, whilſt the ſpiritous ones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to the veſſels that elaſticity of which they had been deprived. Thus a reſolution of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours is effected by means of tranſpiration and circulation: but a wiſe and cautious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner muſt always attend to the progreſs of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0218201200:8"/>the complaint, when either putrefaction or a degree of malignity is apprehended; and care ſhould be always taken to mix this with digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, for critical diſcharges, as by abating their heat it will prevent the neighbouring parts from being affected, and ſecure the patient againſt a too copious diſcharge which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attends theſe caſes.</p>
            <p>The compariſon made between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Saturn, and its ſalt, commonly called the ſugar of lead, will be found unjuſt, when we conſider, that the latter is made with vinegars of all ſorts of wines, and that thoſe of Switzerland, which produce the greateſt quantity of this ſugar, are made of wines very little impregnated with tartar, and that too of an inferior quality. But after all, this very ſugar of lead, which is quoted as a proof of the repelling quality to be found in our medicine, is it not made uſe of by the ableſt practitioners, both as an internal and external medicine? if ſo, with how much more confidence may we make uſe of Mr. Goulard's extract, properly made, in the above circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? A practice of fifty years, has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently convinced me of its ſuperiority over the ſugar of lead, which I have known fail, when the other has always anſwered my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
            <p>Such, as are thus diſpoſed to criticiſe the moſt approved remedies, won't give themſelves time to reflect, that an accidental failure of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0218201200:9"/>ſucceſs might be owing to this extract not having been properly made in its commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſucceeding proceſſes, to its having been given in too great a quantity, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied cold, as indeed the author ſometimes recommends with a view only to the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate climate he writes in: thus have theſe people been induced, without having any regard for themſelves, to confirm the opinion of the vulgar, who generally attribute the death of the patient to the laſt remedy, and thus ſhamefully take advantage of this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious argument to cry down the good effects of the extract of Saturn, and to extol reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at beſt uncertain, often fallacious, and which cuſtom alone, the tyrant of the mind, authoriſes the uſe of both againſt reaſon and experience. Many examples might be brought to refute what perſons, otherwiſe reſpectable, have thought proper to advance to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of this remedy; but I will refer the reader, to many obſervations given by the author in his treatiſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Already mentioned in the note p. 3.</note>, and to take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration here the firſt paragraph of the third Formula, page 208, on the inefficacy of the poultices generally preſcribed.</p>
            <p>The proofs I have given of the neceſſity of procuring the beſt vinegar, and the rules I ſhall lay down in the ſequel, for the better making and uſing this extract, having been
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0218201200:10"/>approved of by men of knowledge and rank in this country, ever intent on means to aſſiſt the poorer part of mankind, have induced me to procure a quantity of it from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain head itſelf. I have applied to Mr. Goulard for this purpoſe, to whom I have likewiſe communicated my thoughts on the farther improvement and uſe of this remedy, which I have the ſatisfaction to know entirely coincide with his. This concurrence of Ideas, which originally ſprung from a fifty years ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, having been fellow-ſtudents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, has induced me to imitate him on other occaſions,<note n="*" place="bottom">See pages 8 and 201 of my treatiſe of diſorders of the urethra and bladder, ſold by P. Elmſly, bookſeller in the Strand, in 12mo. the third edition.</note> and has been the means of his allowing me to be the ſole vender in this country of the extract he himſelf made<note n="†" place="bottom">See the end of theſe remarks.</note>.</p>
            <p>This topic, which properly ſpeaking is an univerſal chirurgical medicine and eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, has this triple advantage over others. Firſt, it coſts but little; ſecondly, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in an inſtant; and thirdly, it may eaſily be conveyed from place to place.</p>
            <p>Whoever is provided with it may prevent the bad conſequences of bruiſes occaſioned either by a fall or blow; it prevents an echymoſis, or extravaſation of blood, the general attendant of fractures and diſlocations,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0218201200:11"/>till proper aſſiſtance can be procured to dreſs the patient <hi>ſecundum artem;</hi> in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it ſhould be made uſe of in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as it is a known remedy againſt inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and mortifications, the general atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of theſe complaints. I ſhall not enter into a detail of the other diſorders it will relieve, but ſhall refer the reader to Mr. Goulard's treatiſe; I ſhall only lay down here ſome few rules for its uſe, drawn from experience, which have met with Mr. Goulard's appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, both as to that and its compoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Every one is ſufficiently acquainted with the powerful effects of vegetable acids, and particularly thoſe of vinegar in regard to braſs, to deter him from making this extract in veſſels of that metal. No precaution is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent the vinegar from imbibing ſome of the copper; it is therefore much more adviſeable to make uſe of veſſels made either of glaſs, earth, or pewter. I ſhould have been much more uneaſy about a gentleman's ſervant, who had ſwallowed by chance, the 8th of December laſt, a certain quantity of the vegeto-mineral water, had not I been very ſure that the extract had not been made in a braſs kettle. I aſſured the maſter in anſwer to his letter, that no bad conſequences would enſue, but that it would be adviſeable to order the patient to drink ſome warm water.</p>

                  <p>I have the pleaſure to inform you, that my ſervant is perfectly well to day: he felt laſt night ſome pains in his ſtomach, which the warm water removed, but no ſtitches, no cholicks. I am &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="2">II. The external qualities, which charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terize the true original extract of Saturn, conſiſt in its colour, its ſmell, its weight, its conſiſtence, and its taſte: its colour is that of orange, its conſiſtence a little ſirupy, its ſmell empyreumatical, or of burnt ſugar, its weight a third part more than that of the vinegar; ſo that a phial, which holds three ounces of vinegar, ought to weigh at leaſt four ounces when filled with the extract; the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0218201200:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>thickneſs of this medicine may be as great a defect as its lightneſs: for, if it weighs more or leſs than it ought, it cannot but deceive in regard to the proportions made uſe of, and not anſwer to the directions given. See p. 8.</p>
            <p n="3">III. When bad vinegar has imbibed as much lead as it can poſſibly diſſolve, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous metallic particles are obſerved to ſink to the bottom of the bottle, ſuch extract, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly called ſo, is but an imperfect diviſion of the lead, which muſt be rejected for the reaſons mentioned in page 8.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. From this mixture of lead and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is produced a water called by the author vegeto-mineral; and this water is endowed with excellent virtues, when made uſe of in lotions, fomentations, injections, and baths, and in the different formulae deſcribed by Mr. Goulard, in his cerate, poultices, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matums, liniments, plaiſters, &amp;c. but the water, of which the vegeto-mineral is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ought to be particularly conſidered in its own natural ſtate, before it is made uſe of to form this medicated water. Every ſpecies of water is not proper for this uſe. Rain water, when purged and filtered, and that of rivers, whoſe bottoms conſiſt of either ſand or gravel free from mud, are to have the preference, eſpecially after having been purified either by ſtanding ſome time, or filtering through proper paper; ſpring and pump water being impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0218201200:14"/>with gypſous or ſelenitous particles, give riſe to a new change of the metallic ones of the lead; and thus a white precipitate is formed, which will by no means incorporate with the water. "Theſe effects, ſays a clebrated chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt<note n="*" place="margin">BEAUME'.</note>, are owing to a ſeparation of the vitriolic acid of the ſelenites from the earth, to which it was joined, which now mixes with the lead of the extract of Saturn, and thus forms a vitriol of lead. In that inſtant the vinegar mixes with the earth of the ſelenites, and they form together an acetoſe-calcarious ſalt; ſo that at the ſame time a new diſſolution and a new combination are effected. Thus the medicine is by no means that of the vegeto-mineral water, but a mixture of vitriol of lead, acetoſe ſalt, and brandy. On this occaſion the vitriol of lead ſeems to deſcend in form of a white powder, tho' it is in reality a ſaline matter diſſoluble in water; the reaſon is, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſſolved without difficulty, and that there is not a ſufficiency of water to diſſolve the whole quantity collected: the remainder of the water contains in diſſolution a ſmall quantity of this vitriol of lead. In fine, if you add to the precipitate a large quantity of boiling water, the diſſolution is perfect; which proves, that this precipitate is a ſaline ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance." From this argument, founded on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0218201200:15"/>natural philoſophy, and confirmed by the experiments of all who make uſe of water not properly purified, may we not conclude that we have no reaſon to be ſurpriſed that this remedy has ſometimes baffled our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? is it not, on the contrary, a ſubject of aſtoniſhment, that notwithſtanding this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental defect in its compoſition it has ſo frequently been crowned with the greateſt ſucceſs? In fine, the water, which diſſolves ſoap the moſt effectually, is to be preferred, tho' it will be proper firſt to purify it well. When the extract is thrown into improper water, it whitens it only for a time, and then falls to the bottom, without being able to mix per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly with it afreſh; this water becomes curdled, and like ſour milk; and in this ſtate it is by no means to be made uſe of, as not at all likely to anſwer our expectations. To this we may aſcribe the want of ſucceſs, which ſerves to prejudice many againſt the remedy, and to pleaſe others, who are by no means its friends for want of being better acquainted with it. When proper water cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, care muſt be taken to diſtil others, if opportunity ſerves. This may be eaſily done with the common alembic, taking care to throw away ſome pints of the firſt diſtilled, as it is frequently liable to be foul, by the uncleaneſs of the head of the ſtill: you muſt likewiſe take care to leave about a quarter of it in the ſtill, before you have finiſhed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0218201200:16"/>your proceſs, to prevent the riſing of any of its heterogeneous particles. But in caſe of neceſſity, where proper water is not to be had, any kind of water may be uſed, taking care to boil and filter it thro' paper which is not ſtiffened, till ſome of the beſt water can be procured<note n="*" place="margin">It is adviſeable, that all thoſe, who make uſe of water in common as their drink, would carefully abſtain from all that are hard, earthy, and ſelenitous, which, are apt to diſorder the ſtomach, and give riſe to ſtrong concretions in the kidneys and other urinary paſſages, eſpecially if they meet with any ſlimy matter. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means of preventing this is by diſtillation, which will ſeparate, even from the pureſt water, ſome hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous ſubſtances; but this muſt be effected in <hi>bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o mariae,</hi> with alembics either of earth or glaſs, taking care always to throw away the two or three firſt pints, that paſs into the receiver, to avoid certain heterogeneous and volatile ſubſtances, which riſe by diſtillation, with the firſt portions of water. You muſt likewiſe finiſh your operation as ſoon as two thirds of your water is diſtilled, becauſe what remains in the ſtill muſt be impregnated more or leſs with noxious particles, which the water might imbibe, was you to continue your proceſs any longer. The water thus diſtilled muſt be put into bottles well waſhed and rinſed with the above diſtilled water. Theſe bottles muſt be ſtopped with a glaſs ſtopple. If the water has been well diſtilled, it will preſerve its limpidity, after you have poured into it ſome drops of the ſolution of mercury by ſpirit of nitre. This experiment muſt be made upon a ſmall quantity of the diſtilled water.</note>.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Nothing is of greater conſequence in preſcriptions, than the aſcertaining the juſt proportion remedies of this kind bear to each
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0218201200:17"/>other: I think the author has rather neglected in regard to his. Looking upon it himſelf as a topical one only, he has been little anxious about the quantities uſed in lotions, poultices, &amp;c. for common caſes; nor is it indeed very material, but when particular caſes occur; ſuch as inflammations of the eyes, ears, throat, and of other parts endued with no leſs a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſenſibility. The author ſeems to have miſtaken the quantity of extract proper for the occaſion, ſee page 204. where he ſays, <q>"For example, (ſpeaking of the eyes) put at firſt ten or twelve drops of it (extract of Saturn) to a common glaſs of water, and increaſe them gradually, as the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſeen to diſperſe—<hi>and after,</hi> againſt the defluxions of the tympanum of the ear and occaſional deafneſs, taking care in theſe caſes, to add to the drops of the extract, double the number of drops of campho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated brandy, though common brandy may be uſed, as for opthalmies."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The indefinite meaſure of a glaſs of water gives here an equivocal ſenſe. It is always improper to preſcribe a remedy by meaſure, when it is to be uſed with circumſpection. Nothing can be aſcertained by <hi>a glaſs of water, a coffee ſpoonfull,</hi> or <hi>drops.</hi> Theſe meaſures contain more or leſs according to the different places they are uſed in, and drops may vary according to the conſiſtence of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.

in the ſame country, care muſt be taken, where it is poſſible, to make uſe of weights, and to reduce foreign ones to thoſe of the country we live in. The author himſelf has followed the weights and meaſures of the country he does inhabit; I will follow the Engliſh one, called <hi>Troy,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Called in French <hi>poids de marc,</hi> or ſilver ſmith's weight. The ſame is uſed in Paris.</note> as it has more affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the Montpellier weight, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided like that into ounces, drachms, ſcruples, and grains. The Troy pound indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains only twelve ounces, and the Montpellier ſixteen, but in the ounce, there is only a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of ſeven grains and an half, the <hi>Troy</hi> ounce being ſo much heavier than the Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier. In the drachm, the difference is leſs than a grain, in the ſcruple, not a third of one. The grain differs more in proportion, as the Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier ſcruple is divided into twenty four grains, and the <hi>Troy</hi> ſcruple into only twenty; but for the ſatisfaction of thoſe, who may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to know the exact difference between the Engliſh and Montpellier weights, I have added a table, in which is expreſſed the value of the Montpellier pound, half pound, ounce, drachm, and grains, both in <hi>Troy</hi> and <hi>Avoir-du-Pois</hi> weight, as likewiſe the ſeveral values of theſe ſorts of weights, compared with the Montpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and with each other; and this I imagine will be the more welcome, as moſt of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who treat of the compariſon of Engliſh
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0218201200:20"/>and French weights, are more likely to miſlead than to inform their readers. I cannot help remarking here, that the origin of different weights, aroſe from the ancient cuſtom of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating them by that of a barley corn, which ſerved as a ſtandard for all the reſt, by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying them into carats, ſcruples, drachms, ounces, pounds,  but, as it neceſſarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that the barley corns, made uſe of in different countries, weighed more or leſs on account of their ſize, moiſture, or dryneſs, it gave riſe to the difference of weights, and made it difficult to aſcertain preciſely thoſe of different countries. It is much to be wiſhed that the different powers of Europe would come to a general regulation of weights, it would be a change of much greater import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to trade than that of the old ſtile, which all nations have not adopted, though there are none who would not find their account in having a general or univerſal ſtandard for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and weight. This, which was always looked on as an impoſſibility, would be the moſt eaſy to be executed, without any expence to governments, and with the eaſieſt one for every individual.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0218201200:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>preſcribed quantity of extract to a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of pure water,<note n="*" place="bottom">This ought to weigh 29 or 30 ounces.</note> is two drachms (five penny weight) if the extract is well made, which quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity will make about a hundred and ten drops. Now, if we ſuppoſe the bottle ought to weigh twenty-nine <hi>Troy</hi> ounces, and a glaſs of water to weigh about three ounces, the quantity of extract, according to the proportion given by Mr. Goulard, would exceed, or at leaſt be equal to that of the vegeto-mineral water preſcribed by him for common uſes, when, on the contrary, the quantity ought to be diminiſhed conſiderably. So that I would recommend, in inflammations of the eyes, to put only two drops of the extract to every ounce of water, and the ſame proportion to be obſerved in all caſes, where the ſenſibility of the part is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delicate, eſpecially ſince Mr. Goulard has brought his extract to ſo great a degree of perfection.</p>
            <p>The method of counting the drops is to have a cork bored from end to end, through which paſs a tube about the ſize of a ſmall quill commonly called a pinion; this quill muſt be cut off at both ends, like the obtuſe end of a tooth-pick; and of the two extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the tube thus cut, one enters into the bottle, and the other remains on the outſide of the cork. By inclining the bottle down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and putting the end of the fore-finger
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0218201200:22"/>upon the aperture of the tube you may let the drops fall at pleaſure, one after the other.</p>
            <p>Mr. Goulard does not recommend his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum in opthalmies, and I think with great reaſon; greaſy and oleagenous ſubſtances are always dangerous in inflammations of the eyes, and eriſipelatous complaints, though they are equally adviſeable for thoſe of the ears: he ought to have recommended the frequent waſhing the eyes, externally with the vegeto-mineral water, and keeping a bolſter conſtantly on them, well wetted with that water. This I have conſtantly practiſed with ſucceſs, but you muſt be careful always to add ſome brandy, and even that which is camphorated. This omiſſion, on the part of the author in his firſt preſcription, gives an air of obſcurity to the laſt part of his ſecond paragraph, by putting you in mind there of the neceſſity of making uſe of brandy in the ſecond preſcription, as well as in the firſt; a circumſtance he has entirely omitted. Let it be remarked, that camphorated brandy on all occaſions is to be preferred to the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camphorated, as I ſhall endeavour to prove in the following article.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. It is my opinion, that in the caſes, in which the author recommends the uſe of camphire, one of the moſt antiphlogiſtic, and antiſpaſmodic medicines in phyſic or ſurgery, he does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it in large quantities enough. Camphire is one of thoſe medicines we uſe too ſparingly,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0218201200:23"/>not being ſufficiently converſant in its effects, which are always wonderful, whether made uſe of externally or internally. I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a work of Mr. Pouteau, intitled, <hi>Melanges de Chirurgie,</hi> which would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any one of the good qualities of this drug. I know an Engliſh gentleman, who not only preſerves himſelf from, but cures himſelf of many complaints by the uſe of camphire, of which he takes inwardly a large quantity; and always carries about him a box of it. When I make uſe of this with the extract of Saturn, it is in large quantities, and with ſome precautions different from thoſe of Mr. Goulard. If it is given in ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, it has no effect; when mixed with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matums, cerates, liniments, it is obliged to undergo the heat of fire, by which means the volatile parts of it are evaporated; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of them, inſenſibly paſſes away, ſo that in a few days none is left. Whenever the vegeto-mineral water is made uſe of, I would recommend the ſame quantity of campho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated brandy, as the author preſcribes of that which is not camphorated. This campho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated brandy ſhould be kept in a bottle well corked; you muſt be careful likewiſe to fill it up now and then, and ſee that the camphire you make uſe of for this purpoſe is not too airy, but that it is freſh, oily, and of a ſtrong perfume.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0218201200:24"/>
            <p n="7">VII. Mr. Goulard recommends the vegeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineral water to be warmed only during the winter, and to make uſe of it in ſummer in its natural ſtate. This diſtinction may be a very juſt one at Montpellier, and in other warm climates; but in England and other cold countries it is abſolutely neceſſary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to warm it, otherwiſe the metallic particles are not ſo thoroughly divided; and by the water's being impregnated with the vegetable parts only the repelling proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with which it is reproach'd, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; the ſame may be ſaid of all cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they act as repellents, by cauſing too great a tenſion in the fibres they ought to relax, and the colder they are the greater is their repelling power; but when warmed, they are of a moiſtening, relaxing, ſoftening and reſolving quality. But particular care muſt be taken not to exceed the doſe above pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in inflammatory caſes; Mr. Coſmond a celebrated ſurgeon has well obſerved that the leaden particles, when introduced into the veſſels in too large a quantity, irritate and force them ſo conſiderably, as frequently to add to the complaint, inſtead of relieving it. This is a fault that many, who are ignorant of the effects of this remedy, frequently fall into; and often blame the medicine, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are only in fault.</p>
            <p>In caſes, where the lymph only is affected, the ſame precaution is not neceſſary, as a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0218201200:25"/>drachm or two of extract more may be ſafely added to each bottle of water.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Such, as are little verſed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the medicinal virtues of metals, are very apt to make coſmetic pomatums with the vegeto-mineral water. Theſe have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the errors handed down to us by our anceſtors, who have made uſe of lead under various forms; others did uſe ſuch as magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of pewter and biſmuth, &amp;c. which have rather ſerved to deſtroy the beauty of the ſkin, than to preſerve it; the reaſon is evident: theſe metals, by infinuating themſelves into the pores, there depoſe ſome of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles the moſt divided, and by firſt opening, and then filling up theſe pores ſpoil the fineſt features.</p>
            <p>Theſe metallic particles become of a black dye, and plainly ſhew a leaden colour, which can be concealed only from the eye, by the application of a white waſh compoſed of the ſame drug, which by plaiſtering over the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the ſkin add to its deformity. The author of theſe remarks begs leave to caution the fair ſex from truſting to theſe pomatums, the compoſition of which is a ſecret, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to conceal the known poiſon they are fraught with, which for a ſhort time appears to anſwer their intentions, only to give the deeper wound afterwards. Time only can re-eſtabliſh nature, and the uſe of the poma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums deſcribed by the author in his Treatiſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0218201200:26"/>on Ruptures, p. 138, by leaving out the gold and the ſaffron, the firſt making the ſkin black, the other yellow. This pomatum, without altering the ſkin, ſoftens, and nouriſhes it, preſerves its tranſparency, deſtroys tetters and redneſs, fills up wrinkles, and repairs all da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages done to it, either by the uſe of other pomatums or paint. This pomatum is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſuperior to that of Saturn, or the cerate for removing the piles, for the ſcalding of the ſkin, and to remove the ſpots, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after the ſmall pox, if applied to it ſome time after the eruption.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. I muſt here add, that the pure liquid extract of Saturn,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is the liquid extract only, which is mentioned it this Treatiſe.</note> mixed with double the quantity of oil of turpentine is the moſt ſovereign remedy known againſt a ſprain in a horſe, by rubbing him with this liniment, as ſoon as the accident happens, taking care to keep the part well covered, till you have got him home to the ſtable; if he ſhould ſtill continue lame, or appear in pain, you muſt rub him again, before he grows cold, and repeat this every four hours, keep him well cloathed, and allow him but half his uſual quantity of food, and give him warm water with ſome bran in it to promote perſpiration: it ſeldom happens, if theſe rules are attended to, but that the cure is compleated in four-and-twenty hours.</p>
