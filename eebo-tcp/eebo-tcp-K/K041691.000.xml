            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE always obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that, in Addreſſes of
this Nature, the general
Taſte of the World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
ingenious Turns of Wit, and
<pb facs="tcp:0496900100:5"/>
diſguiſed artful Periods, inſtead of
an open Sincerity of Sentiment flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a plain Expreſſion. From
what ſecret Impatience of the juſteſt
Praiſe, when beſtowed on Others,
this often proceeds, rather than a
pretended Delicacy, is beyond my
Purpoſe here to enquire. But as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more foreign to the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of a Soul ſincerely pleaſed
with the Contemplation of what is
beautiful, and excellent, than Wit and
Turn; I have too much Reſpect for
your Ladyſhip's Character, either to
touch it in that gay, trifling Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or venture on a particular Detail
<pb facs="tcp:0496900100:6"/>
of thoſe truly amiable Qualities of
which it is compoſed. A Mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,
pure, and elegant, a Heart
overflowing with Humanity, and the
whole Train of Virtues thence deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that give a pleaſing Spirit to
Converſation, an engaging Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the Manners, and form the Life
to Harmony, are rather to be felt,
and ſilently admired, than expreſſed.
I have attempted, in the following
Poem, to paint ſome of the moſt
tender Beauties, and delicate Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of Nature; how much in vain,
your Ladyſhip's Taſte will, I am
afraid, but too ſoon diſcover: Yet
<pb facs="tcp:0496900100:7"/>
would it ſtill be a much eaſier Task
to find Expreſſion for all that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Colour, Form, and Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance,
which enrich the Seaſon I
deſcribe, than to ſpeak the many
nameleſs Graces, and Native Riches
of a Mind capable ſo much at once
to reliſh Solitude, and adorn So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
To whom then could theſe
Sheets be more properly inſcribed
than to You, MADAM, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
in the World can give them
the Protection they want, while
your fine Imagination, and intimate
Acquaintance with <hi>Rural Nature,</hi> will
recommend them with the greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:0496900100:8"/>
Advantage to your favourable No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice?
Happy! if I have hit any
of thoſe Images, and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Sentiments, your calm Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Walks, in the moſt delightful
Retirement, have oft inſpired. I
could add too, that as this Poem
grew up under your Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it has therefore a natural
Claim to your Patronage. Should
You read it with Approbation, it's
Muſick ſhall not droop; and ſhould
it have the good Fortune to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
your Smiles, it's Roſes ſhall
not wither. But, where the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is ſo tempting, leſt I begin
<pb facs="tcp:0496900100:9"/>
my Poem before the Dedication is
ended, I here break ſhort, and beg

            <p>THAT the following Poem appears at preſent

the Propoſals I lately Publiſhed for Printing the
<hi>FOUR SEASONS, &amp;c.</hi> by Subſcription, but
at the Solicitation of ſome of my Friends who
had ſeen it in Manuſcript, and the better to
carry on a Work I ſtand engaged to finiſh.
For <hi>Subſcription</hi> is now at its laſt Gaſp,
and the World ſeems to have got the better of
that many-headed Monſter. However, thoſe
Gentlemen and Ladies who have been, or
may hereafter be ſo good as to honour me
with their Names, ſhall have the Book next
Winter according to my Propoſals: And if
it ſhould, in any Degree, be judged worthy their
Encouragement, I have my beſt Reward.</p>
