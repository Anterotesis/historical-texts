            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>COULD ſome gentlemen of approved ability have been prevailed
upon to do juſtice to the ſubject of the following Ode, the preſent
apology would have been unneceſſary;—but as it was requiſite to
produce ſomething of this kind upon the occaſion, and the lot
having unluckily fallen on the perſon perhaps the leaſt qualified to
ſucceed in the attempt, it is hoped the candour of the public will
eſteem the performance rather as an act of duty, than vanity in the
author.</p>
            <p>As ſome news-paper writers have illiberally endeavoured to ſhake
the poetic character of our immortal bard (too deeply indeed rooted
in the heart to be affected by them) it is recommended to thoſe
who are not ſufficiently eſtabliſhed in their dramatic faith, to peruſe
a work lately publiſhed, called, <hi>An Eſſay on the Writings and Genius
of</hi> SHAKESPEARE, by which they will with much ſatisfaction be
convinced, that <hi>England</hi> may juſtly boaſt the honour of producing
the greateſt dramatic poet in the world.</p>
            <p>To ſtrengthen and juſtify the general admiration of this aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Genius, it has been thought proper to ſubjoin to the Ode ſome
undeniable Teſtimonies (both in proſe and verſe) of his unequalled
original talents.</p>
            <p>If it ſhall be found, that <hi>ſpeaking</hi> that part of the Ode, which
has uſually been conveyed in recitative, produces a better effect,
the Author flatters himſelf he may lay claim to ſome little merit on
that account: As to the Ode itſelf, he preſents it to the public as
an object of their good-nature,—to his friends as an exerciſe of
their partiality,—to his enemies, as a lucky opportunity of venting
their wit, humour, criticiſm, ſpleen, or whatever elſe they pleaſe,
ſhould they think it worthy of their notice.</p>

Though there are many, many more poets who have ſpoken of
<hi>SHAKESPEARE</hi> with equal praiſe and admiration, yet theſe, which
firſt occurred, were thought ſufficient.—Leſt any of our readers
ſhould think with a certain gentleman, who, upon hearing <hi>Milton</hi>'s
verſes in praiſe of <hi>SHAKESPEARE,</hi> ſaid, He never regarded what
was ſaid in poetry,—that the very nature of it was fiction, and
had no value without it,—there is added ſome undeniable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in proſe, of <hi>SHAKESPEARE</hi>'s unparalleled genius.</p>
            <q>
               <p>—SHAKESPEARE was a man, who, of all modern, and
perhaps ancient poets, had the largeſt and moſt comprehenſive
ſoul. All the images of Nature were ſtill preſent to him, and he
drew them not labouriouſly, but luckily: when he deſcribes any
thing, you more than ſee it, you feel it too. Thoſe who accuſe
him to have wanted learning, give him the greater commendation:
he was naturally learned: he needed not the ſpectacles of books to
read Nature; he looked inwards, and found her there. I cannot
ſay he is every where alike; where he ſo, I ſhould do him injury
to compare him with the greateſt of mankind. But he is always
great, where ſome great occaſion is preſented to him: No man
can ſay he ever had a fit ſubject for his wit, and did not then raiſe
himſelf as high above the reſt of poets,

               <p>Among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> SHAKESPEARE has incomparably excelled
all others. That noble extravagance of fancy, which he had in
ſo great perfection, thoroughly qualified him to touch this weak
ſuperſtitious part of his reader's imagination; and made him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ſucceeding, when he had nothing to ſupport him beſides
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0154100200:28"/>
the ſtrength of his own genius. There is ſomething ſo wild, and
yet ſo ſolemn, in the ſpeeches of his ghoſts, fairies, witches, and
the like imaginary perſons, that we cannot forbear thinking them
natural, though we have no rule by which to judge of them, and
muſt confeſs, if there are ſuch beings in the world, it looks highly
probable they ſhould talk and act as he has repreſented them.</p>
               <p>—Our inimitable SHAKSPEARE is a ſtumbling-block to the
whole tribe of theſe rigid criticks: who would not rather read one
of his plays, when there is not a ſingle rule of the ſtage obſerved,
than any production of a modern critic, where there is not one of
them violated? SHAKESPEARE was indeed born with all the ſeeds
of poetry, and may be compared to the ſtone of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s ring,
which, as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, had the figure of Apollo and the nine
muſes in the viens of it, produced by the ſpontaneous hand of
Nature without any help from art.</p>

            </q>
            <q>
               <p>But certainly the greatneſs of this Author's genius does no where
ſo much appear, as where he gives his imagination an entire looſe,
and raiſes his fancy to a flight above mankind, and the limits of the
viſible world.</p>

            <q>
               <p>If ever any author deſerved the name of an original it was
SHAKESPEARE. Homer himſelf drew not his art ſo immediately
from the fountains of Nature, it proceeded through Egyptian
ſtainers and channels, and came to him not without ſome tincture
of the learning, or ſome caſt of the models of thoſe before him.
The poetry of SHAKESPEARE was inſpiration indeed: he is not ſo
much an imitator, as an inſtrument of Nature; and it is not ſo juſt
to ſay that he ſpeaks from her, as that ſhe ſpeaks through him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0154100200:29"/>
His characters are ſo much Nature herſelf, that it is a ſort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to call them by ſo diſtant a name as copies of her. Thoſe of
other poets have a conſtant reſemblance, which ſhews that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them from one another, and were but multipliers of the
ſame image: each picture, like a mock rainbow, is but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
of a reflection. But every ſingle character in SHAKESPEARE
is as much an individual, as thoſe in life itſelf; it is as impoſſible to
find any two alike; and ſuch as from their relation or affinity in any
reſpect appear moſt to be twins, will, upon compariſon, be found
remarkably diſtinct. To this life and variety of character, we muſt
add the wonderful preſervation of it; which is ſuch throughout
his plays, that had all the ſpeeches been printed without the very
names of the perſons, I believe one might have applied them with
certainty to every ſpeaker.</p>
               <p>The power over our paſſions was never poſſeſſed in a more eminent
degree, or diſplayed in ſo different inſtances. Yet all along, there is
ſeen no labour, no pains to raiſe them; no preparation to guide
our gueſs to the effect, or to be perceived to lead toward it: but
the heart ſwells, and the tears burſt out, juſt at the proper places:
we are ſurprized the moment we weep; and yet upon reflection
find the paſſion ſo juſt, that we ſhould be ſurprized if we had not
wept, and wept at that very moment.</p>
               <p>How aſtoniſhing is it again, that the paſſions directly oppoſite to
theſe, Laughter and Spleen, are no leſs at his command! That he
is not more a maſter of the great, than of the ridiculous, in human
nature; of our nobleſt tenderneſſes, than of our vaineſt foibles;
of our ſtrongeſt emotions, than of our idleſt ſenſations!</p>
               <p>Nor does he only excel in the paſſions; in the coolneſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
and reaſoning, he is full as admirable. His ſentiments are
not only in general the moſt pertinent and judicious upon every
ſubject, but by a talent very peculiar, ſomething between pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0154100200:30"/>
and felicity, he hits upon that particular point on which the
bent of each argument turns, or the force of each moment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.
This is perfectly amazing, from a man of no education
or experience in thoſe great and public ſcenes of life, which are
uſually the ſubject of his thoughts: ſo that he ſeems to have known
the world by intuition, to have looked through human nature at one
glance, and to be the only author that gives ground for a very new
opinion, That the philoſopher, and even the man of the world,
may be born as well as the poet.</p>

that his ſcenes are beautiful and noble, though ſometimes dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:

               <p>In how many points of light muſt we be obliged to gaze at
this great poet! In how many branches of excellence to conſider
and admire him! Whether we view him on the ſide of art or
nature, he ought equally to engage our attention: whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the force and greatneſs of his genius, the extent of his
knowledge and reading, the power and addreſs with which he
throws out and applies either Nature, or Learning, there is ample
ſcope both for our wonder and pleaſure. If his diction, and the
cloathing of his thoughts attract us, how much more muſt we be
charmed with the richneſs and variety of his images and ideas! If his
images and ideas ſteal into our ſouls, and ſtrike upon our fancy,
how much are they improved in price, when we come to reflect with
what propriety and juſtneſs they are applied to character! If we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0154100200:31"/>
look into his characters, and how they are furniſhed and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the employment he cuts out for them, how are we taken
up with the maſtery of his portraits! What draughts of Nature!
What variety of originals, and how differing from each other! How
are they dreſſed from the ſtores of his own luxurious imagination,
without being the apes of mode, or borrowing from any foreign
wardrobe!</p>

<q>
                     <l>To gild refined gold, or paint the lily,</l>
                     <l>To throw a perfume on the violet,</l>
                     <l>To ſmooth the ice, or add another hue</l>
                     <l>Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light</l>

                  </q>And waſteful and ridiculous indeed it would be, to ſay any thing
in his praiſe, when preſenting the world with ſuch a collection of
beauties, as perhaps is no where to be met with; and, I may very
ſafely affirm, cannot be paralleled from the productions of any
other ſingle author, ancient or modern.</p>

               <p>—If ſuch another poet could ariſe, ſhould I very vehemently
reproach him, that his firſt act paſſed at <hi>Venice,</hi> and his next at
<hi>Cyprus.</hi> Such violations of rules merely paſſive, becomes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
Genius of SHAKESPEARE, and ſuch cenſures are ſuitable
to the minute and ſlender criticiſm of Voltaire:
<q>
                     <l>Non uſque adeo permiſcuit imis</l>
                     <l>Longus ſumma dies, ut non, ſi voce Metelli</l>

This therefore is the praiſe of SHAKESPEARE, that his drama is
the mirrour of life; that he who has mazed his imagination, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the phantoms which other writers raiſe up before him, may
here be cured of his delirious extaſies, by reading human ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

incubation, the dull work of putting them correctly upon paper,
and afterwards publiſhig, is a taſk they cannot away with. If the

could be inquired into and known, they would yield proof
in abundance of the juſtneſs of what is here aſſerted: but the author

            <q>
               <p>SHAKESPEARE is a kind of eſtabliſhed religion in poetry, and
his bays will always flouriſh with undiminiſhed verdure. When
I ſay this, I am not for maintaining that he is not guilty of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
but for every tranſgreſſion he recompences his auditors
with beauties which no art will ever equal. That the notes
eſtabliſhed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> are agreeable to nature, I am
ready to allow, and that inferior geniuſes may avail themſelves by
a ſkilful conformity to them, I as freely aſſent to. But fable is but
a ſecondary beauty; the exhibition of character, and the excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the paſſions, juſtly claim the precedence in dramatic
poetry. It is in writing as in gardening, where nature does not
afford ſpontaneous beauties, recourſe muſt be had to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſlow and endeavouring art, to the regularity of uniform
viſtas, the intricacy of elaborate mazes, and a ſtudied inſertion of
ever-greens; but when the courſe of the country of itſelf preſents
attractive ſcenes on every ſide, when the trees branch out with a
free expanſion, and the bold proſpect ſurprizes with the heath, the
lawn, the hill, and valley in wild variety, the littleneſs of tedious
culture is unneceſſary, and trifling ornaments are unlooked for.</p>

               <p>Such is SHAKESPEARE's merit, that the more juſt and refined the

He was approved by his own age, admired by the next,
and is revered, and almoſt adored by the preſent. His merit is
diſputed by little wits, and his errors are the jeſts of little critics;
but there has not been a great poet, or great critic, ſince his time,
who has not ſpoken of him with the higheſt veneration, Mr. <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire</hi>
excepted. His tranſlations often, his criticiſms ſtill oftener,
prove he did not perfectly underſtand the words of the author: and
therefore it is certain he could not enter into his meaning. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
enough to perceive he was unobſervant of ſome eſtabliſhed
rules of compoſition; the felicity with which he performs what no
rules can teach, eſcapes him. Will not an intelligent ſpectator ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the prodigious ſtructures of <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> becauſe he does not
know by what law of mechanics they were raiſed? Like them our
author's works will remain for ever the greateſt monuments of the

prodigies, with an attention to, and admiration of their ſtupendous
parts, and proud irregularity of greatneſs.</p>
