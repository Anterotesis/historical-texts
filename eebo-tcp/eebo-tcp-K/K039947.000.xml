            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Reaſon of my undertaking the following Analyſis, will be plainly enough ſeen in the Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but whether I have ſucceeded or fail'd in my Account of the <hi>Diabetes</hi> and it's Cure, as it ariſes from the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Waters, is left entirely to your Determination.</p>
            <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0202900900:3"/>
            <p>It has never once enter'd into my Imagination, that thoſe Waters will more effectually cure a <hi>Diabetes</hi> and <hi>Hectic</hi> now than heretofore, or any great Advantage accrue to Mankind from this Account; yet it has ever been agreeable to find the Theory of any Science, correſponding to the Facts ariſing from the Practice of it.</p>
            <p>You will excuſe me, if thro' this Account of the <hi>Diabetes, &amp;c.</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to my Profeſſion. Every Man has ſome Bias, and the Buſineſs in which he is moſt engag'd is naturally moſt apt to draw him.</p>
            <p>There was a time you perfectly well know, when almoſt every thing in Phyſic was accounted for from Chemical Principles. There was alſo, when every Diſeaſe and the Cure of
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0202900900:4"/>it, was reduced to Mathematical and Hydroſtatical Accounts: And all theſe in their different Turns have diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, and Obſervation and the Hiſtory of Diſeaſes have again ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>But methinks there is a Degree of Truth annex'd to every Manner of accounting for Diſorders, tho' not an abſolute one, and they ſeem to be moſtly falſe, only when they deny a Truth to each other. Anatomy will diſcover to us, that the Arteries and Veins contain what we call Blood, but what that Fluid is, and what Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations ariſe in it from different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Heat, and the Addition of different Medicines, Chemiſtry alone can inform us. It informs us alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally, whether our Secretions, ſome of them, are perfectly ſecern'd
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0202900900:5"/>or not. And tho' we cannot venture to aſcertain, that becauſe ſuch and ſuch Phaenomena ariſe from the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of different Medicines with the Animal Fluids, apart from the Body, that they will be ſimilar there to, when within the Laws of Circulation; yet we muſt not altogether diſpiſe the <hi>Experimental</hi> and <hi>Analogical</hi> Manner of reaſoning; ſince we very often ſee that very fatal Conſequences are brought on by Medicine, and very probably too in the ſame Manner within us, as without, in the Experiments. It would be as ridiculous, juſt, as if we ſhould contemn the Advantages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing from Numbers becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain to Infinity.</p>
            <p>Whatever has been ſaid here in the Chemical Hypotheſis, may be ſaid with equal Truth in another View of
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0202900900:6"/>the Mathematical and Hydroſtatical Account.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps ſeem at firſt Sight that the Situation of the Well is too poetically deſcribed, for any thing in which Phyſic is concern'd; but I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine when it is conſider'd that it was deſign'd as a Picture, and as it relieves the Mind from the Dryneſs of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, ſuch a Liberty may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd me; eſpecially ſince when the Deſcription ends, that kind of Stile is no longer continued.</p>
            <p>If this Eſſay ſhould have the good Fortune of being liked by you, it will amply reward the Care I took in the Experimental Part; where to be juſt was my ſtricteſt Endeavour, as it ſhall always be in preparing thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which may come under your
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0202900900:7"/>Adminiſtration: And for thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that every Phyſician may receive the due Honour of a juſt Preſcription, and every Patient the true Effect of a good Medicine.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is more than a Year ſince I began a Courſe of Experiments on the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Waters; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knowing that Dr <hi>Keir</hi> had undertaken the Analyſis, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtopt my Enquiry, and awaited his Publication, in Expectation of ſomething quite accurate and ſatisfactory. Upon peruſal of his Book I found my ſelf diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and continu'd my Experiments for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe I ſee no Account for the Heat and other Phaenomena of the Waters.</p>
            <p>Next, I apprehend the Concluſions drawn from his Experiments are not juſt.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0202900900:9"/>
            <p>And laſtly, If the Waters do contain what the Doctor affirms, they will ever be irreconcilable with the Cure of a <hi>Diabetes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think then, there needs no Apology for an Enquiry of this Kind. It rather becomes neceſſary that ſome other ſhould be made which may bring the Rationale and Practice of thoſe Waters to coincide, and ſatisfy the Patient of the Truth of ſome Principles, upon which he may ground his Expectation of a Cure. Now let us ſuppoſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Limeſtone Powder</hi> with an exceeding ſubtle Spirit. Is there in this City any Phyſician that would heartily preſcribe theſe Waters: Or any diſtant Phyſician that would ſend a Patient to a Mineral either trifling, inefficacious, or of a Nature quite oppoſite the Cure? If then this ſhould be the Event, which is not unlikely, it will be fatal to the Health, if not Lives, of great Numbers.</p>
            <p>As the following Experiments are of my own making, I can the better anſwer for the Truth of the Facts. There has been no Accuracy wanting in diſcovering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Waters, and aſcertaining them from Phaenomena quite definitive. I have produced alſo analogous Appearances by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Experiments, with Conjectures of their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0202900900:10"/>Cauſes; then having conſider'd the Source of a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> I ſhew the Effects of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents on animal Solids and Fluids as they produce the Cure.</p>
            <p>Whatever Contradictions may be found in this Analyſis to that of Dr <hi>Keir,</hi> they muſt not be underſtood to ariſe from any Inclination I have to contradict, but from the Truth of the Examination. And where that is the Suppoſition every Man will be ſatisfied with it, however contrary to his Sentiments.</p>

            <head>THE SITUATION OF THE HOT-WELL.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Situation of the <hi>Hot-Well</hi> is as pictureſque perhaps as can be imagin'd; it lies on the Side of the River <hi>Avon,</hi> about a Mile and half diſtant from the City of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> The Stream iſſues from a very high Clift of Lime Rock, perhaps two hundred Feet below the Summit, and ten above the Level of Low Water, but as the Water riſes here in the loweſt Tides thirty Feet, and in the Spring much more, it was of Neceſſity ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd inacceſſible ſome hours every Day, till Mr <hi>Padmore,</hi> (a Man well known for his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0202900900:12"/>Genius in Mechanics) inclos'd it with a Ciſtern, and affixed Pumps to the Spring, by means of theſe the Stream is elevated almoſt thirty Feet in all its native Heat, Purity, and Perfection: Notwithſtanding this Care the River Water, when it riſes above the Spring, mixes with the Medicinal and renders it unfit for Uſe; this is perfectly well known by thoſe that pump at the Well, and conſequently as ſoon as perceived they abſtain till it recovers its former Purity.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Avon</hi> flows here till it falls int othe <hi>Severn</hi> Sea, between two Cliffs, in ſome Places vaſtly high, craggy and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanging, in others perpendicular or gently ſloping; here cover'd with Woods and flowering Shrubs, of all the different Shades of Green, fill'd with Muſic of our Singing Birds; There gloomy and obſcure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted by ſtrong Lights, and various Colours of the Marble Rocks, which are as variega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the foreign, and admit as beautiful a Poliſh. Add to this the flowing of the Tide which enhanſes the Beauty, by bringing Veſſels of every Kind cloſe to the Windows of the <hi>Water-Room,</hi> and compleats as agreeable Landſcape as can be ſeen any where. And as the Mind and Body reciprocally affect each other, how proper an Entertainment is it for the Imaginations of Men indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0202900900:13"/>and how Salutary an Avocation to thoſe Thoughts which every <hi>Valetudinarian</hi> is too apt to indulge? Hence it is in ſome greater degree conducive to Health, than Places altogether void of theſe Amuſements.</p>
            <p>On the Summit of the Rocks there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſtood a Chapel, dedicated to St <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> it is equally uncertain whether he was canonized for the Diſcovery of the Medicinal Spring, and the Cures thence reſulting to Mankind, or from clearing the River of huge Rocks that diſtreſs'd the Sailors in their Navigation near this Place. Whatever was the Cauſe, he conſtantly received their Vows for fafety as their tutelar Saint, and was of no ſmall Diſtinction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Downs</hi> which are on a Level with the Cliffs are of a dry healthy Soil, and much frequented by Company; they are open to the reviving Breezes of the Sea, which refreſh them every Summer's Day. Here too you may adapt your Proſpects and Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every Humour, whither you chuſe to be conceal'd beneath the Shade of Rocks and Woods, reclin'd beſide ſome murmuring Rivulet, which naturally return our Thoughts upon ourſelves; or whether you prefer the exalted Situation, where the Mind widens with the View into Benevolence and good
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0202900900:14"/>Wiſhes. That Proſpects have a kind of Moral Effect on the Thought I preſume no one will deny, ſince Light and Colours are to the Eye, what Sound and Harmony is to the Ear. Hence too it was that the Temples of the ancient Deities were ſituated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Attributes: That of <hi>Pluto</hi> in a Cavern all ſad and gloomy, by the Side of rumbling Waters; whilſt that of the Muſes was placed on the Point of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> all gay and enlivening; perhaps the moſt elevated Eminence of this Cliff was made the Seat of St <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Chapel, becauſe his Beneficence was more extenſive than that of other Men.</p>
            <p>The eſſential Difference of the Air in this Place, from moſt other dry and elevated Situations is, that it has but little, if any, of that <hi>vague Acid,</hi> ſo generally diſperſed thro' the Earth, which in ſome Places is even deadly, as at the Grotto <hi>Dei Cani</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> We may be aſſured of this from the Nature of the Waters and Foſſils in both, which, an Alcaleſcence prevails. Now every thing offenſive in the Atmoſphere muſt ariſe from Exhalation, but it is ſcarce probable that there are any acid Effluvia here, becauſe if the acid was in any Quantity there muſt be more Salts found in the Water, ſince it is evident there is no want of Limeſtone: Now Limeſtone and a mineral Acid for ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0202900900:15"/>Alum, and conſequently as there is little Alum found here, the Air muſt be void of acid Effluvia: Notwithſtanding this this great Advantage, it muſt not be thought that this Air is agreeable to every Indiſpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it can be of Service to none but thoſe of a cold pituitous nervous Habit, and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to all whoſe Juices tend to Alcaleſcence and Putrefaction from a ſanguine Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Lodging-Houſes are neat and well ſituated, having a pleaſant Proſpect, and as they are near a large City 'tis eaſy to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with every Neceſſary: Here are Baths too, both private and well contriv'd, and a <hi>Long Room</hi> with the uſual Diverſions attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Places.</p>
            <p>It ſeems but of little Significancy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Quantity of Water diſcharged in any certain Time, becauſe it conduces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards an Account of it's Properties, and ſince there is more waſted than uſed, notwithſtanding the great Demand for it. But ſhould there be any one curious enough to enquire, he may be ſatisfied by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Experiment: it has been experimentally found by Monſieur <hi>Mariotte,</hi> that Water flowing from the Surface of a Pool thro' a Hole an Inch ſquare, and always full, runs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0202900900:16"/>off thirty Cubic Feet in an Hour, <hi>Paris</hi> Meaſure. Upon this Experiment having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the mean Proportion of the Depth of the Stream, where it runs out over the Rock, it may be nearly known how many ſquare Inches it contains, and conſequently what Aperture it would paſs through naturally; then conſidering that the Contents of Circles are to each other as the Squares of their Diameters, the whole Diſcharge in one Hour may be pretty juſtly known.</p>
            <p>How long this Medicinal Water has been preſcribed by Phyſicians, for thoſe Maladies it is now ſo deſervedly eſteem'd to cure, is uncertain. We know however, that they have been adminiſter'd with great Succeſs, and their Character much heighten'd by the preſent Phyſicians of <hi>Briſtol.</hi>

               <hi>Conjectures on the Cauſe of the Heat of the</hi> HOT-WELL <hi>Water.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEFORE I begin, I foreſee the moſt material Objection, which is, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally there is no Limeſtone calcin'd, and conſequently the Heat muſt ariſe from ſome other Cauſe; and as that Acid which is every where floating thro' the Earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles Oil of Vitriol, it will, like that Oil meeting with Water, produce Heat; this may be granted, but then the Stream would taſte acid, and turn Syrup of Violets red, and the Alum muſt be in greater Proportion, ſince here is more alcaline Earth than the Acid can ſate: Which is demonſtrated by the alcaline Qualities predominating at the Well. Neither can the Warmth ariſe from the Solution of the Salts, for all foſſile Salts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0202900900:27"/>produce Cold in Diſſolution, much leſs can it come from the Attrition of the Water, becauſe that is experimentally known not to affect Water. If in the poliſhing two Marble Stones you rub one againſt the other dry, they will conceive an intenſe Heat, but add the leaſt Water and it is impoſſible to produce it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Objections then being got over, I beg leave to take back my own Sentiments wherever I find them, and endeavour to prove, that it is probable, at ſome diſtant Time this Lime Rock was partially cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd by a ſubterraneous Fire, and has ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Stream with Warmth ever ſince.</p>
            <p>It muſt be conſider'd at the ſame Time, that this Subject will admit of no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Proof, and whether I ſucceed or not in the Account of the Cauſe of the Heat, it has already been definitively proved to be a Lime Water, in which is diſſolved Alum and Sea-Salt; but as Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is in great Part but Analogy, and as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability is equal to Demonſtration in all Caſes where a down-right Negative with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Support is the Oppoſition, it may be allow'd me here. To inſtance, ſuppoſe yourſelf in any Country in which there was not the leaſt Trace of any human Preſence
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0202900900:28"/>but ſome very antique and ruin'd Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, what would you conclude? Why that as thoſe Structures were as far as ever you had obſerv'd, the Effects of Men, this muſt be ſo likewiſe, the Parallel will hold, for it is as certain that ſubterraneous Fires have broke Hills aſunder, and alter'd the Courſe of Rivers; and that Fire will burn Limeſtone according to its Degree and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as that Ruins are the Proofs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Means: Eſpecially when it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by all the collateral Phaenomena left after ſuch Convulſions.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee whether we have Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the preſent Caſe to ſupport us. Whoever conſiders the Situation of the Hot-Well, that it lies between two Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, between which alſo the River runs, will directly imagine that in the Place of this River there was once a continu'd Hill, and that the Chaſm was cauſed by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preternatural and violent. Add the correſponding Inequalities of the Cliffs on each Side, and that the Heat ariſes from Lime in the Act of ſlaking, and that naturally there is no Lime without Fire. The Inclination of the River is moſt evidently thro' the Valley of <hi>Long Aſhton,</hi> which leads to the <hi>Severn</hi> Sea, and there is a faint Tradition that it once ran that Way, till
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0202900900:29"/>St <hi>Vincent</hi> by cleaving the Rocks form'd the Channel through which it now runs. Thoſe Traditions however Fabulous they may appear, have generally ſome real Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tho' traced with Difficulty fond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the numerous Years that cover them, and obſcur'd by the Imaginations of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind too apt to run into the marvellous.

               <p>EVERY Diſeaſe to which we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected muſt neceſſarily ariſe from ſome Alteration in the Solids or Fluids, a <hi>Diabetes</hi> may ariſe from either; but I believe the moſt frequent and moſt fatal ariſes from the want of Digeſtion in the <hi>Primae Viae,</hi> or from what may be ſafely enough call'd the Secondary Digeſtion in the minuter Veſſels. My Meaning will be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by what follows. Digeſtion, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, is nothing more than preparing the Aliments for a Separation to be made by the Lacteals: Now when this Separation is perform'd, and the ſecreted Chyle brought into the Blood, there remains another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Nature; which is to aſſimilate the nutritious and throw off the detrimental Particles by the Kidnies and cuticular Glands. For unleſs the Urinous Salts <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted, it is no more <hi>Nutriment</hi> in the Blood than it was <hi>Chyle</hi> before it was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted from the <hi>Faeces,</hi> and this is what is meant by the Secondary Digeſtion.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0202900900:31"/>
               <p>It follows now, that a Fault in either of theſe Functions may be the Source of many Diſtempers, and as it is univerſally allow'd that the weakeſt Part ſuffers in every Aſſault, there may be various Diſeaſes from one and the ſame Cauſe, according as Conſtitutions are differently diſpoſed to receive Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Particularly ſuppoſe any one has ſpent a Life gay enough, <q>
                     <hi>"Bottle and Friend too much indulging."</hi>
                  </q> Upon any Fault in either of the Functions, a Diſeaſe will likely enough fall on the Kidnies, as thoſe have been the Glands moſtly diſtended and weakned by frequent uſe.</p>
               <p>It is notorious alſo, that the continu'd uſe of ſpirituous Liquors indurates all Aliments, and ſtiffens the Fibres of the Stomach. Nay that Spirit of Wine injected into the Arteries of a living Animal, immediately congeals the Serum, impedes Circulation, and Death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues. This is in ſome Degree the Caſe, whenever we indulge too freely in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Liquors, and at laſt totally deprives us of Appetite and Digeſtion. If Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion then is but illy perform'd in the <hi>Primae Viae,</hi> inſtead of Chyle the Secretion will be crude and imperfect, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Fault will never be amended when it gets within the Laws of Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor will the <hi>Vis Naturae</hi> of itſelf avail
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0202900900:32"/>to ſeparate thoſe Salts by the Kidnies; thence it will reſult, that thro' want of this Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there be will no Nutriment aſſimilated, and an Accumulation of Fluids ſupervening, the Veſſels and Glands are diſtended, and the Serum, with all the Nutritious Juice, paſſes off by the Kidnies.</p>

                  </note> was a too profuſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0202900900:33"/>Diſcharge of Urine. But there cannot be a greater Miſtake, the Diſorder is not from too great a Diſcharge of Urine, but quite contrary, becauſe there is no Urine at all diſcharged, but Serum or Chyle in it's Room: For it is ſcarce poſſible to ſecrete too much Urine, or any natural Secretion, but the Danger ever is, when ſomething that is not the true Secretion is carried off. This holds equally true in <hi>Hectic</hi> Fevers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Sweats, and I ſhall endeavour to ſhew that <hi>Hectic</hi> Sweats are thro' the Cuticular Glands, what a <hi>Diabetes</hi> is by the Kidnies.</p>
               <p>That what has already been ſaid is the true Cauſe of a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the Hiſtory of that Malady, as laid down by our beſt Phyſicians, and every Symptom is eaſily deduced from that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. Whoever will take the leaſt trouble to review the above Quotations, will eaſily deduce every Symptom from the Cauſe which has been aſſign'd before; and muſt obſerve that the Cure wholly depends upon bringing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0202900900:34"/>back the true Secretion of Urine, which is no more than ſeparating the animal Salts from the Fluids, and reſtoring the Strength and Elaſticity of the over-diſtended Fibres.</p>
               <p>There remains now that we examine, if Lime in the Act of ſlaking will ſeparate thoſe urinous Salts, and whether Alum will reſtore the Tone of the weaken'd Fibres. What the Effects of Lime will be cannot be better ſeen than by the XCVIIth Experiment of the learned <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> with his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it's Uſe.</p>
               <p>Hence are plainly diſcover'd the Effects of Lime on animal Fluids, and that it exactly executes what a Medicine muſt do to cure a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> which is to extricate, and prepare an eaſy Secretion for the more fixed muriatic Salts ſticking in the Blood. Let us now ſuppoſe that this Separation of the Salts is brought about, what muſt be added to finiſh the Cure? It muſt be ſome Medicine which may bring the Fibres into a contractile State, and recover that Elaſticy they had loſt from too great Diſtention; that Alum will anſwer in all this Part is notorious; from it's Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency it will bring the Stomach into ſtronger Contractions, and improve Digeſtion; in the Glands it will leſſen the Diameters of the ſecreting Veſſels; in the Arteries it will
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0202900900:35"/>ſhorten their Fibres, improve their Spring, and accelerate the Circulation; and as, according to the Laws of Hydroſtatics, Fluids circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in Tubes have their lighteſt Parts dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Sides, whilſt the more heavy are propell'd, the emulgent Arteries lying at right Angles muſt receive the lighteſt Parts of the Fluid, and bring it to the Kidnies, which from the aluminous Particles are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to let nothing thro' but theſe Salts diſſolved in the aqueous Menſtrum, which the Lime had before diſengaged.</p>
               <p>We can now aſſign a good Reaſon for the drinking thoſe Waters warm at the Spring, without being obliged to a Ficton for their Virtues. Since it is demonſtrated, that all the ſalutary Effects ariſe from the <hi>ſlaking</hi> Lime, and that after that Action ceaſes by cooling, it produces no Alteration on animal Solids and Fluids, but as a mere alcaline Earth. The aluminous Part indeed, tho' the ſame at a Diſtance as when on the Spot, avails no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the previous Separation of the Salts, which can be effected by the <hi>ſlaking</hi> Lime only.</p>
               <p>Let us now examine what would have been the Conſequences in the foregoing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, if the Contents of the Hot-Well
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0202900900:36"/>had been a ſubtle Spirit, Nitre, and Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone Powder; if that had been a Spirit it muſt be a Mineral one, if a Mineral Spirit an Acid one, now all Mineral Acids coagulate the Blood, and hinder Secretions ariſing from Alcaleſcence

               <p>It may be objected here, that, inſtead of proceeding on <hi>Boerhave</hi>'s Experiment on Urine, I ſhould have tried whether it would have anſwer'd with the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Waters, and if it would not, my Concluſions are all falſe and ſuppoſititious only. Suppoſe this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection true, it has a plauſible Appearance, yet upon Examination does not ſtand the Teſt.</p>
               <p>It is certain we can conceive no Alteration by our Senſes in any thing, unleſs it be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0202900900:37"/>ſtrong enough to create a diſtinct Perception. The Atmoſphere differs in Preſſure from the heavieſt to the lighteſt many Degrees, yet I believe no one will ſay that he feels any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution or Increaſe of Weight in the Alteration, the Reaſon is becauſe this Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not a ſufficient Avocation to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Attention we muſt allow the general At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. Now with Reſpect to the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Water, were it ten times as ſtrongly impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Lime, it would create a very viſible Effect in the foregoing Experiment, but tho' it ſhould not as it is, yet it muſt not be concluded from thence that it is quite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficacious, we muſt ſay notwithſtanding that it has every proportional Appearance with the other. Another Inſtance will better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my Meaning. You have a Bundle of Straw under your Arm, I take one ſecretly from you, yet by the ſtricteſt Scrutiny of your Eye and Hand you neither perceive the Weight nor Number much leſſen'd; but it is leſſen'd in both reſpects, or the Weight is compounded from an aggregate of no Weights, and the Number of no Numbers, which is impoſſible. Well then, ſhould I repeat the Theft it will at laſt appear very plain in both Senſes, and you were hinder'd from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it in the firſt, by what was ſaid of the Atmoſphere, the Difference was not great enough to create a diſtinct Perception,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0202900900:38"/>and call off your Attention from the greater Weight of the Bundle. The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Waters, that tho' it ſhould create no perceivable Alteration at any one time taken ſingly, yet often repeated it would have the ſame Effects with the other, but in a ſlower Way.</p>
               <p>From the ſlight Impregnation of Lime, we may eaſily deduce it's moſt ſalutary Effects, as it's Alterations are ſilently and mildly carried on, without producing thoſe violent Symptoms which would follow from a larger Quantity, as Fevers, Deliriums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the very ſame is true as to the Quantity of the Alum.</p>

                  <hi>Of a</hi> HECTIC FEVER.</head>
               <p>IT has already been mention'd, that the Sweats of a <hi>Hectic</hi> were thro' the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary Glands, what a <hi>Diabetes</hi> is thro' the Kidnies; and if we attend diligently, we ſhall find that, like the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a <hi>Hectic</hi> Fever does not ariſe from too profuſe a Secretion of Sweat, but from the nutritious Particles paſſing off this way:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0202900900:39"/>For there is no Inſtance of a too large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge by Sweat, provided it is really that Secretion. Now what has been ſaid with reſpect to a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> that there can be no Nutriment aſſimilated, unleſs the excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Fluids are ſecern'd, holds true here, for this Reaſon, all attempts are vain which endeavour to check thoſe <hi>Hectic</hi> Sweats, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering the Juices, and generating the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Diſcharge. Is it not always obſerv'd as often as you endeavour to ſtop thoſe Sweats, if you ſucceed in that particular, a <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> conſtantly ſucceeds, equally fatal as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Symptom? It has been obſerv'd by the ingenious Dr <hi>Allen,</hi> that a <hi>Diabetes</hi> and <hi>Ptyaliſmus</hi> have alternately ſucceeded the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of each other, and that the Cure of one was the Cure of the other: It is the ſame in a <hi>Hectic,</hi> if you <hi>cure</hi> the Sweats you ſuppreſs the <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> but if you only <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive</hi> it from the Glands of the Skin to thoſe of the Inteſtines, you have not proceded one Step towards the Patient's Recovery; nor can he poſſibly recover till he produce the natural Diſcharges, that the nutritious Particles may be laid aſide for the Support of Life, and this ſeems likely to be effected by the ſlaking Lime, as in the <hi>Diabetes;</hi> for the Salts of the animal Fluids are the ſame in every Secretion, and the State of the Fluids
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0202900900:40"/>the ſame in each Diſorder, only the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſſes thro' different Emunctories, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Conſtitution is diſpoſed from a particular Texture of the Glands. I need not apply the uſe of the Alum, becauſe every one will ſee it's uſe as plainly here as in the <hi>Diabetes.</hi> There can no Objection ariſe from the Lime, as if it ſhould produce a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefact State of the Blood, becauſe then the Salts in the
<note n="*" place="bottom">BOER. <hi>Proceſſ.</hi> XCVII.</note> Experiment on the Urine would have been Volatile Alkalies, whereas it is neither Acid nor Alcali, but quite a-kin to the Human.</p>
               <p>What Advantage may not ariſe from the Uſe of this <hi>Briſtol</hi> Water, if the Patient would apply to them before he is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of Medicine? Nay, even in the laſt State of a Pulmonary Conſumption I cannot ſee but it muſt be ſerviceable, for it is certain Human Nature cannot be ſuſtain'd without Nutrition, and no Nutrition can be form'd without the previous Separation of the excrementitious Salts: Nor can the Ulcers of the Lungs incarne, unleſs the true Balſam be brought to them, which I apprehend to be no more than true Nutriment.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0202900900:41"/>
               <p>There may be many other Diſeaſes in which it may be beneficial, as in the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantiaſis</hi> from a cold Cauſe, <hi>Chloroſis,</hi> and all <hi>Cachexies,</hi> where the Fluids are too viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous and the Fibres too much relax'd.</p>

            <head>OF THE EFFECTS OF THE WATERS IN NEPHRITIC DISORDERS.</head>
            <p>IT has of late been an Objection to the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Waters, that upon the Uſe of them they have increaſed the Gravel in thoſe Subjects liable to that Complaint, and for that Reaſon not to be drank ſafely by ſuch Perſons. A ſtricter Attention, and a fair State of the Caſe will ſet the Matter in a quite oppoſite Light.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0202900900:43"/>
            <p>It has been found by ſome ſubject to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phritic Complaints, that at their firſt coming to the Well and drinking the Waters, the Paroxyſms have oftner ſucceeded each other, and with more Violence than before, and thence they have concluded that the Waters increaſe theſe Diſorders: But how unjuſt is this when we conſider that the Pain is not the Diſeaſe, but a Conſequence of it's paſſing off by Means of Medicine, or the Efforts of Nature throwing off the already generated Concretions. Suppoſe any Quantity of Gravel lodg'd in the Baſon of the Kidnies, is it not manifeſt that Pains muſt ſucceed upon it's removal from thence thro' the Ureters into the Bladder? And is it not equally certain, that whatever promotes the diſlodging this Gravel from the Kidnies is a ſalutary Medicine? And the more efficacious it is, the oftner the Paroxyſms will follow each other, till the whole is brought away? This is directly the Caſe in the Hot Well Water, and ſeen in this true Light removes the Objection.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee whether our Theory will not vindicate this Fact. Every one allows that Nephitic Diſeaſes ariſe from ſome Fault in the Urinary Secretion; it has been already experimentally obſerv'd, that <hi>ſlaking Lime</hi> produces that true Secretion; hence it follows that no Alterative can be more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0202900900:44"/>purſued than this Medicinal Water, ſince it waſhes off the already concreted Gravel, and hinders it from being generated a-new, by producing the genuine Diſcharge.</p>
            <p>It does not belong to me to ſay what Medicine or Diet is beſt adapted in each Caſe with theſe Waters, whatever Phyſician ſhall have the Care of thoſe that drink this Medicinal Water, will inform them in theſe and many other things, altogether beyond any thing that can be ſaid by me.</p>
