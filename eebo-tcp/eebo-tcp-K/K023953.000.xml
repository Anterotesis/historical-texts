            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON SOME OF THE ARTICLES OF DIET AND REGIMEN, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT muſt he obvious to every perſon converſant in the ſcience of medicine, that the dietetic part of it, or that which reſpects our regimen and way of life, has not been improved in equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0682000400:4"/>with that which regards the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of medicines. This was obſerved ſeveral years ago by an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced and learned<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Huxham. Vide his Eſſay on Fevers.</note> practitioner, and I believe there is no reaſon to think that the caſe is altered ſince his time. This inattention has ariſen from ſeveral cauſes. Few of the modern writers on the Materia Medica conſider ſubſtances merely nutritive, or ſuch as are uſed in diet, however they may differ from each other in their nature, as coming within their ſphere, ſo that this ſubject is ſcarcely directly treated of under any of the branches into which the ſtudy of medicine is at preſent divided. Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed itſelf, and the ſubſtances that conduce to it, are conſidered as a part of phyſiology; but this is more with reference to the mode of its being performed, and the effects of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0682000400:5"/>employed in it upon a healthy body, than with reſpect to the proper choice of them in various diſorders. Few likewiſe of the modern practical writers are very explicit on this ſubject, and their directions relative to it are more commonly drawn from reaſoning and theory, or the authority of former writers, than any actual experience of the effects of the ſubſtances recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended or forbidden. In reſpect of attention to this point, we are far inferior to the ancients.</p>
            <p>Hippocrates hardly deſcribes a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe without recommending a regimen of life adapted to its cure; and this circumſtance, which in reality is greatly to his credit, has been, I am perſuaded, one of the grounds of the objections made againſt his practice, as being in many caſes frivolous and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0682000400:6"/>which would have been in a great meaſure obviated, had many of the ſubſtances he adviſes been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as articles of diet rather than of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
            <p>His commentator Galen, and his follower Celſus, have both imitated his example in this reſpect, as there is ſcarce a diſorder treated of by them, wherein there is not a very diffuſe and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of the regimen, and way of life which they conceive to be beſt ſuited to its cure.</p>
            <p>Aretaeus likewiſe, perhaps the moſt judicious of any of the ancient writers, has laid ſo much ſtreſs on this article in many diſorders, that he has declared the whole of the cure depends on an attention to the regulation of the diet and way of life; and this not in chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0682000400:7"/>cauſes only, but in acute ones alſo.</p>
            <p>The ſame obſervation holds good with reſpect to the other moſt approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed writers of antiquity on the ſubject of medicine, and I am apt to think that the diſregard of thoſe which has been of late ſo ſtudiouſly inculcated by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the modern profeſſors of that ſcience, and which ſucceeded to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant veneration formerly paid to them, has diminiſhed the attention of the faculty to this branch; and in that reſpect, as well as many others, has been of no ſervice to medicine, either as a ſcience or a practical art. Another circumſtance ſeemingly trivial, that has cauſed this part of medicine to be leſs conſidered, is, that the directions for the medicines only are accuſtomed to be given in writing; whereas thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0682000400:8"/>which regard diet and regimen, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in caſes which require medical attendance, only delivered verbally, which has in ſome meaſure cauſed them to be leſs attended to, and even held as inferior in their nature and conſequence to thoſe which concern the apothecary.</p>
            <p>The difficulty likewiſe of procuring a compliance with rules of regimen and diet, has alſo proved a great obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to any improvement that might have been produced by practice and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Theſe cauſes, among many others, have contributed to produce that rotin of practice ſo conſpicuous in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age with regard to this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. To correct this in general, and lay down rules of diet and regimen adapted to the various diſorders incident
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0682000400:9"/>to human life, would be a highly uſeful, though extremely arduous undertaking. Such a one, however, would much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the limits of the preſent pamphlet, which is not meant to treat of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in general, but to endeavour to amend ſome errors into which many practitioners have fallen, from indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately following great names in the profeſſion.</p>
            <p>And here I would obſerve, that in every caſe wherein we wiſh to preſerve the ſtrength as entire as poſſible, as in moſt chronical complaints, we ſhould be extremely cautious in preſcribing a rigid regimen with reſpect to diet, eſpecially if ſuch regimen is intended to be long continued.</p>
            <p>This circumſtance deſerves particular attention on ſeveral accounts. Few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0682000400:10"/>even of the beſt health, can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſguſt, bear to be confined to a peculiar food or way of living for any length of time (which is a ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that variety of food is natural to mankind); and if ſo, the debilitated ſtomach of Valetudinarians cannot be expected to be leſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Hippocrates cautions againſt this very properly in chronic diſeaſes—Quapropter hoc admoneo ut dicentibus quidem attendant, facientibus autem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbant &amp; contractam victus rationem non diu preſcribant. Aegrotantis enim diuturnam, concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcentiam erigit indulgentia etlam in morbo diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnoa. —Hippocrates Praeceptiones, Cap. XI.</note> affected.</p>
            <p>Now in the human body the taſte ſeems to be the index or ſign of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being agreeable to the ſtomach, or fit for digeſtion; at least it may be ſaid that things diſagreeable to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſeldom digeſt well, or contribute
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0682000400:11"/>towards the nouriſhment of the body; a circumſtance of the moſt eſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. A rigid regimen of diet I have alſo obſerved frequently to have an ill effect on the ſpirits, by continually reminding the patients of their valetudinary ſtate, by a compariſon of their ſituation with that of others who enjoy greater liberty in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>Another ill effect of a regimen of diet is, that it tends to diminiſh the quantity of food taken in, which conduces greatly to weaken the body, not only on account of the defect of quantity of nouriſhment, though that is of no ſmall importance, but alſo by other means.</p>
            <p>The filling of the ſtomach at ſtated intervals to a certain degree with food, ſeems neceſſary to the health of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0682000400:12"/>human frame, not on account only of the nouriſhment it ſupplies, but alſo of the tenſion thereby produced on the fibres of the ſtomach, which is from thence communicated to the ſyſtem, and ſerves alſo to excite ſuch a degree of reaction in the ſtomach itſelf, and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary canal, as to enable it to digeſt the food, and diſtribute the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly through the Syſtem. It is therefore probable then, that when a quantity of the food is ſubſtracted, the body ſuffers not only from defect of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, but alſo from want of its accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed ſtimulus and firmneſs of fibre, which were uſed to be imparted to it at certain periods.</p>
            <p>It is probable alſo, that when the food is taken in an under proportion, that for the reaſons above given, it would neither be itſelf ſo well digeſted,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0682000400:13"/>nor the chyle it affords ſo perfectly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilated. A healthy ſtomach is indeed enabled to accommodate itſelf without much inconvenience to conſiderable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties in this reſpect, but where its powers are debilitated, the ſmalleſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may be of the utmoſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>I imagine alſo, that a diminution of the quantity of food has another effect, which is a very common attendant on an impaired digeſtion, viz. that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a coſtive habit. When the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of the ſtomach is inconſiderable, little tenſion is communicated to the inteſtines, and of conſequence their propulſive power is much weakened, eſpecially as the bulk of the food is too ſmall to prove any conſiderable ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the bowels themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0682000400:14"/>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances duly conſidered, ought to make phyſicians very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in limiting the mode of living, and particularly the quantity of food under ſuch circumſtances.</p>
            <p>I would here alſo particularly object againſt ſome of thoſe prepoſterous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to combine together food and medicine, which I have frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Thus I have many times ſeen infuſions of bitter and foeted herbs; ſuch as the carduus benedictus, flowers of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maemel, and the marſh trefoil, commonly called buckbean, directed to be taken at breakfaſt, in place either of nutritive ſubſtances, or ſuch as by their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able flavour promoted the taking in of nouriſhment. I have alſo ſeen the ſame recommended in ſome meaſure at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and I hardly need add, that in all ſuch caſes I have obſerved the appetite
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0682000400:15"/>and ſtrength to be impaired, and all the bad ſymptoms ſucceed that ariſe from a defect of nouriſhment. But this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as it may be, is not the only inconvenience. It frequently cauſes medicinal courſes of this kind to be longer continued than is conſiſtent either with the intentions of the phyſician, or the health of the patient. Beſides moſt of the ſubſtances recommended on theſe occaſions, are of the bitter kind, and it is well known that the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued uſe of bitters is very hazardous to the health and conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The famous Portland Powder for the gout was nothing more than a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſtrong bitters, which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the effect of preventing the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful returns of that complaint in inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the extremities, but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always attended with the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0682000400:16"/>conſequence to health and life. Nor are the ill effects of the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued uſe of bitters to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe only who are ſubject to the gout, ſince they act by injuring the tone of the ſtomach, and if long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in, will entirely deſtroy its villous coat. This will ſhew the danger of employing them for a long period to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whatever the circumſtances of the health may be.</p>
            <p>Another piece of advice which I have known ſometimes given to thoſe whoſe ſtomach and digeſtion is weak, is, to take their food as dry as poſſible, or to drink as little as they can of any liquid with their meat.</p>
            <p>This is among other things adviſed by Dr. Cadogan, in his treatiſe on the gout and other chronical diſeaſes. How
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0682000400:17"/>this came to be made an article of regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in general, I am at a loſs to ſay, or how the thirſt came to be thought a leſs certain ſign than hunger, of the proper degree of indulging a natural appetite<note n="*" place="bottom">Fidi autem (ſitis &amp; fames) naturae duces ſunt.—Haller.
<p>Cum porro eaedem cauſae fitim faciant quae faciunt neceſſitatem bibendi, aequum eſt eadem menſurâ &amp; finem obtineri ob quem bibitur, &amp; terminum facere deſiderii.—Adeo fidelis eſt horum deſideriorum vox, ut etiam ſpeciem cibi potuſque, omnino aptiſſimé diſtinguant.

               </note>. Exceſs in either is obviouſly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, but of the two, provided ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors be not the object, it is leſs dangerous to exceed in quantity of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid than of ſolid food<note n="†" place="bottom">Magis in cibo minus in potu peccatur cujus major portio poſſit quaſi infundi, quia ventriculo non retinetur. Haller. Phyſiol. vol. 6. p. 254.</note>. I have my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf frequently ſeen this reſtriction put
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0682000400:18"/>in practice, but never with any good effect; and generally the conſequence of it was, to produce or increaſe a coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive habit, which is itſelf a frequent and troubleſome ſymptom in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>
            <p>To avoid all vegetable food, fruit, and even bread, and to uſe animal food for the ſolid part of our diet, has been, and ſtill is ſometimes recommended in caſes of bad digeſtion, attended with flatulence, acidity, and other ſymptoms that uſually accompany ſuch complaints. This has been, no doubt, adviſed upon the ſuppoſition that animal food will not run either into the vinous or ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous fermentation, and of conſequence produce neither flatulence nor acidity either in the ſtomach or inteſtines. But the truth of this theory is very much to be doubted.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0682000400:19"/>
            <p>It has been found impracticable for any perſon to ſubſiſt on animal food alone for even a few days, as a putrid diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the body ſoon begins to take place, as is manifeſted by the nauſea and thirſt which almoſt conſtantly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur.</p>
            <p>Some mixture of vegetable food then is neceſſary to the ſupport of life. But a compoſition of animal and vegetable ſubſtances is ſubject to both the vinous and acetous fermentations, as appears by Sir John Pringle's experiments on animal and vegetable decoctions, all of which became in time aceſcent. Nay, he even found that an admixture of animal matter both accelerated and heightened the acetous fermentation to a great degree.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0682000400:20"/>
            <p>Animal diet then alone is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of obviating theſe ſymptoms, and I greatly ſuſpect that in many inſtances it aggravates them conſiderably. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and vegetable ſubſtances generate air during the putrefactive fermentation, as well as during the vinous or acetous, and this is obſervable in putrid fevers, wherein foetid eructations are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and troubleſome; and for the cure of which vegetable ſubſtances are highly efficacious.</p>
            <p>This is alſo further exemplified in the ſcurvy; a high degree of which is very apt to be produced by a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued uſe of this diet. I have never obſerved myſelf flatulence to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the moderate proportion of vegetables, provided they were dreſſed, and either of the root kind, as pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0682000400:21"/>&amp;c. Or farinaceous feeds, as rice, barley &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Bread likewiſe, and perhaps with ſtill leſs reaſon than any of the other vegetable ſubſtances, is often included in the general prohibition. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is the moſt miſtaken as well as dangerous piece of advice that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be given. The uſe of bread is as ancient as the hiſtory of mankind, and at the ſame time ſo univerſal, that without ſomething of this nature no people ſeem to live. Even the dreary Laplander, though from the aſperity of his climate unable to raiſe corn, makes a ſubſtitute for bread of the inner rind of the pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree mixed with dried fiſhes, which does not appear to be uſed ſo much with a view to the nouriſhment it anords, as that it ſupplies a food of a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. For this mankind have an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0682000400:22"/>univerſal appetite, which is not difficult to account for. The digeſtion of our food depends in a great degree on the mixture of the animal fluids in every ſtage of it; one of the firſt and perhaps the principal of theſe is the ſaliva, which is conſtantly preſent in all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, even in inſects. To draw this fluid forth from the glands that ſecretes it, a ſolid food is neceſſary as a ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, and to afford a ſufficient preſſure; and it is likewiſe requiſite that it ſhould be dry as well as ſolid, in order to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorb the fluid thus preſſed out. Mild, ſlippery, and fluid aliments, are too inert to act as a ſtimulus, too ſoft to impart a preſſure, and make too ſhort a ſtay in the mouth to exert any effect in this way, and are moreover not fitted to abſorb the glandular liquor.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0682000400:23"/>
            <p>Bread likewiſe being neceſſary to be chewed before it be ſwallowed, has another ſuperiority over fluid aliment, as the action of the mouth, in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that operation, tends to preſs out the ſalivary glands, while the ſaliva it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by means of the action of the teeth, is mixed properly with the food. It is likewiſe of the utmoſt ſervice in uniting the oily and watery parts of our food, for which nothing is better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted than bread, aſſiſted by a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manducation. As a ſolid body, bread alſo, when received into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, ſtimulates and preſſes out the glands, and produces a proper ſupply of the gaſtric liquor, which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a purpoſe not to be attained by mere fluid aliment. Nor is bread thus prepared much liable to the objections generally made to it and other vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble food, viz. of generating flatulence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0682000400:24"/>and acidity. If has already paſſed in a great meaſure through the ſtage of the vinous fermentation, and therefore can undergo it only imperfectly a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and its intimate mixture with the animal fluids, the ſaliva par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, prevents the acetous fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation going to any great length; which laſt indeed, when it takes place, cauſes the bread to become in a degree purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and of conſequence to be ſooner evacuated.</p>
            <p>But in reality the acetous fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which bread is capable, is ſcarce ever increaſed to any great degree, and the ſour or leavened cakes<note n="*" place="bottom">This is probably owing to the heat uſed in the baking, which acts very powerfully in ſtopping fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</note>, in which this fermentation is purpoſely promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do not appear by experience to give
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0682000400:25"/>any uneaſineſs by their acidity, and are found by many a great preventative of flatulence, as having already compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vinous fermentation, they no longer give out air.</p>
            <p>Such then are ſome of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages attending the uſe of bread in our diet. Let us now ſee how theſe can be compenſated by ſubſtituting animal food in the room of it.</p>
            <p>Animal food as being in itſelf ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and of a ſolid conſiſtence, may have the ſame effects as bread, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſalival glands, and thoſe alſo of the ſtomach; but as its pores are already filled with a fluid, it does not ſo well abſorb the ſaliva, or mix ſo intimately with it. It is likewiſe deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a proper intermedium for unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oily and watery parts, in both
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0682000400:26"/>of which animal ſubſtances abound ſo largely. They are therefore very apt to ſeparate, and the oily part as the lighteſt to ſwim at top, which cauſes thoſe oily eructations which flame in the fire, which people of weak digeſtion are liable to, and which I have myſelf obſerved to be much more frequent with thoſe to whom bread is prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and which ſymptom I have ſeen manifeſtly relieved by returning to the uſe of that ſubſtance. The leaving off bread has alſo another ill effect in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the taking in of ſufficient nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, animal food itſelf being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely apt to pall and nauſeate the ſtomach, and of conſequence to be taken in leſs quantity than if a proportion of vegetable food was join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. But the moſt material in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience this kind of diet produces, is, by the putrid tendency of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0682000400:27"/>fluids, which it brings on if long continued, and which the uſe of bread alone is ſufficient in a great meaſure to obviate.</p>
            <p>Butter likewiſe has been generally adviſed to be abſtained from by thoſe whoſe digeſtion is weak and ſtomach flatulent. The uſe of butter, or ſome ſubſtitute for it, as oil, is, as far as we can learn, equally ancient, and nearly as univerſal as that of bread. It is deſcribed in the earlieſt hiſtories as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a part of the food of mankind, and ſeems to have been particularly uſed in thoſe countries in which a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable diet was the moſt general.</p>
            <p>The propriety of the uſe of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this kind in food, ſeems to be eſtabliſhed from the general practice, nor is it difficult to be accounted for.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0682000400:28"/>
            <p>Vegetable ſubſtances, and even ſome animal ones, when dreſſed by fire, ſeem to require ſome oily ſubſtance to be taken with them, in order to render them acceptable to the taſte. Thus butter or oil is univerſally deſired with boiled vegetables, and with fiſh, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the more inſipid kind, and which themſelves contain little oily matter. This ſeems to be from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inſtinct implanted probably for the purpoſe of rendering ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more eaſy of digeſtion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>Oily ſubſtances themſelves are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely nutritious, as is evidenced by the effects of thoſe foods which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moſt oil, as animal food, oily ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, and milk, which are well known to have a great tendency to fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0682000400:29"/>thoſe animals that are fed upon them.</p>
            <p>Oily ſubſtances beſides are not only directly nutritive, but likewiſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards ſupplying the oil neceſſary in the animal oeconomy, as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana adipoſa, the marrow, the oily part of the bones, &amp;c. of which there is a conſtant waſte, and which requires to be frequently renewed.</p>
            <p>Nor is oil uſeful in the ſyſtem for the above purpoſes only, as it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to produce the gelatinous and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, as well as the oily parts, ſuch as the ſynovia of the joints, the mucus of the bowels, &amp;c. which as Haller ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, are ſecreted from the matter contained in the adipoſe membrane.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0682000400:30"/>
            <p>It is likewiſe probable, as Haller ſuggeſts, that oil is neceſſary in our diet to provide a ſupply of bile, which is moſtly compoſed of an oily matter, and to the generation of which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſupply of that kind muſt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>Such are ſome of the uſes of oily food relative to the ſyſtem, or when abſorbed by the lacteal or lymphatic veſſels; but it is alſo of conſiderable importance in the article of digeſtion, and for other purpoſes in the ſtomach and inteſtines.</p>
            <p>Oily ſubſtances are of great efficacy in checking the vinous fermentation, as we ſee by experience, that a very ſmall quantity of oil will ſtop, or at leaſt conſiderably retard the fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a large bulk of any liquor in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0682000400:31"/>that ſtate, and perhaps its effects in ſtopping the ebullition of ſugar, for which purpoſe it is uſed by thoſe who prepare this commodity, may be owing to a ſimilar cauſe.</p>
            <p>Tis probable that our fondneſs for butter with vegetables, and for cream with ſome raw fruits, may be owing to a natural appetite ſuggeſted to us or the above account.</p>
            <p>The preſence of oil in the ſtomach and bowels, ſeems alſo to be neceſſary for covering or moderating the acrimony of ſeveral parts of our food, as the pungency or ſtimulus of ſeveral vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, particularly of the ſpice kind, or the ſiliquoſe plants, with which oil indeed is generally combined, as in ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0682000400:32"/>
            <p>A proportion of oil in our aliment appears alſo to be requiſite to keep the alvine evacuations in a regular ſtate. Whether this effect be produced by its lubricating the bowels, and thus faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litating the paſſage of the food through them, or by its aſſiſting to generate bile, or to form the natural mucus of the inteſtines, I cannot determine; but from repeated experience, I have good reaſon to think the fact ſufficiently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained.</p>
            <p>Such, among many others, are the purpoſes which an admixture of oil in our food ſerves in the animal oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. Some inconveniencies it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſometimes produces, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the action of the ſtomach and digeſtion is impaired. In theſe caſes it is apt to ſeparate from the other parts of the food, and ſwim on the top,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0682000400:33"/>and thus produce thoſe oily eructation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> before ſpoken of, which are generally eſteemed to be among the moſt certain marks of an impaired digeſtion. It is likewiſe, when thus ſeparated, apt to become rancid, and then produces that ſenſation about the pit of the ſtomach, reſembling the heartburn, which is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially obſervable whenever the butter or oil has been expoſed to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree of heat.</p>
            <p>But the former of theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, I am ſatisfied is generally ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt in a great meaſure, to the regimen of life uſually adviſed in ſuch caſes, and particularly to the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bread, one of the principal uſes of which is to promote the due mixture of the oily parts with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the food; and as to the latter, it in a great degree depends on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0682000400:34"/>the other, and may often be in a great meaſure remedied by care in the choice of our food, and caution in dreſſing, that it be not expoſed to too vehement a heat, as in ſuch caſes it is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a diſagreeable ſtimulus, and is alſo hot nearly ſo miſcible with, the animal fluids, as if none, or a moderate heat only had been employed.</p>
            <p>On a review of theſe arguments I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help being of opinion, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of butter and oily ſubſtances to perſons in a valetudinary ſtate, is by much too indiſcriminate. In caſes where the habit is corpulent, and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies obviouſly ariſe from thence, ſuch a reſtriction is highly proper and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but theſe ſcarce ever occur where the ſtomach and appetite are impaired, in which caſes the indications in general are of a contrary kind; to ſupport the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0682000400:35"/>ſtrength, and of conſequence the bulk of the body as much as poſſible.</p>
            <p>Moſt hypochondriacal caſes are of this kind: the ſubjects of which are commonly of a lean and ſpare habit of body, which is indeed a ſymptom of the complaint, of the recovery from which there is no ſign more certain than the regaining or acquiring a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of fleſh and plumpneſs.</p>
            <p>I think I have been able to obſerve ſeveral inconveniencies of the kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, to ariſe from a reſtraint in this article of diet, and this without any alleviation of the ſymptoms it was intended to relieve; and have ſeveral times ſeen ſuch perſons return to their former diet, and a moderate uſe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind in their food, not only without any aggravation, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0682000400:36"/>often with a manifeſt abatement of their troubleſome ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible indeed that if we were to attend to the accounts given by many valetudinary perſons, we might be apt to conceive the moſt dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences liable to occur in many caſes from the uſe of butter or oily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. But the caprice of valetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians, eſpecially hypochondriacal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who form a large proportion of them, is ſuch as to diſable them from much candour of obſervation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to render their accounts very ſuſpicious.</p>
            <p>From a habit of ill health they are led naturally enough to a conſideration of the ſubject, but being in general deſtitute of the fundamental principles of medical knowledge, they are very
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0682000400:37"/>partial in obſervation, and ſtill more prejudiced in their concluſions. Add to this an impetuoſity and obſtinacy of temper, which frequently attends ſuch people, and which is very different from that diſpoſition which is the moſt likely to devellop philoſophical truths by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, accurate, and repeated obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Several of theſe I have myſelf met with, who being prepoſſeſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its uſe, have given the moſt dreadful accounts of the ill effects of a ſmall quantity of butter or other oily ſubſtance, yet I have prevailed with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the moſt prejudiced of theſe that I have met with, to make the trial of its uſe a ſecond time, and can ſafely ſay, that I have never obſerved any ill effects there from, provided the cautions before mentioned were attended to; but have always found it grateful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0682000400:38"/>to the ſtomach, rather aſſiſtant than injurious to digeſtion, and where its nutritious properties were deſired, highly ſerviceable, not only by its own proper qualities, but alſo by its render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other food more agreeable, and of conſequence liable to be taken in greater quantity.</p>
            <p>The above remarks are applicable not to butter only, but alſo in a great meaſure to the fat of animals. There is indeed ſome difference; butter is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mixed with a proportion of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal mucilage; which renders it more miſcible with the juices of the body, but at the ſame time more apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ranceſcent. Vegetable oils are free from this, but at the ſame time by long keeping are capable of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rancid alſo, and as all thoſe we uſe in this country internally, come
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0682000400:39"/>from abroad, and of conſequence muſt have been long kept, they are ſeldom if ever free from a taint of this kind.</p>
            <p>Animal fats are alſo liable to ranceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and alſo to a higher degree of putrefaction; but as they are always eaten (except in ſalted meat) before this has time to take place it is of little conſequence, and indeed the difference between theſe and butter, with reſpect to their effects on the human body, is not ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed to render it of conſequence ſufficient to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly noticed.</p>
            <p>Another of the forbidden articles is ſugar, and the ſubſtances prepared with it. This is probably on account of its aceſcency to which it is undoubtedly, under ſome circumſtances, liable in a conſiderable degree. But I much doubt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0682000400:40"/>if it often exerts this quality in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, ſo as to be injurious. The repeated boilings that ſugar, at leaſt the better kinds of it uſed in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have undergone, check in a great meaſure its fermentative quality, and as it is alſo with us moſtly uſed under cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances wherein it has been expoſed to a heat ſtill more conſiderable, as in preſerved fruits, pies, puddings, &amp;c. this tendency is ſtill farther corrected. Van Swieten mentions ſeveral examples of perſons who have taken ſugar in ſuch quantities, as not to be eſteemed ſo much a condiment as an article of food, and this without experiencing any of the ill effects that might be ſuppoſed to ariſe from ſuch a diet, but on the contrary found it an innocent, nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and healthy ſubſtance. I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, from experience, that even crude ſugar is ſo far from adding to the aceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0682000400:41"/>of vegetables, that it checks it conſiderably; and I believe it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon remark, that ſeveral fruits, which eaten alone, create flatulence in many ſtomachs, have no ſuch effects when taken with ſugar; and what is a great confirmation of this, it is well known that thoſe fruits which contain the moſt ſugar, eſpecially if they approach to a farinaceous conſiſtence, may be eaten with the greateſt ſafety of any.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances being conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it appears that ſugar, at leaſt in the quantity it is uſually taken, is far from being injurious, even to perſons of a weak ſtomach and digeſtion, nor indeed do I recollect ever to have heard any complaint on that account. It is now found to be not only an innocent but even a neceſſary part of the aliment
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0682000400:42"/>of<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Armſtrong on the diſeaſes moſt fatal to infants, p. 137.</note> young children, to whom a food of an aceſcent nature would be ill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted, as their ſtomachs are ſo ſubject to acidity; and moreover the fondneſe of children ſor this ſubſtance, is a great evidence of its ſalubrity, at leaſt to them, and ſuch a one likewiſe as we cannot ſuſpect of being feigned or miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or of being any other than a natural inſtinct.</p>
            <p>But in my opinion ſugar is ſo far from exerting any ill effects in caſes of weak digeſtion, that it is highly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. In order to render digeſtion perfect, it is neceſſary that the oily and watery parts of our aliment ſhould be intimately combined, and the ſeparation of theſe, as I have before remarked, is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0682000400:43"/>one of the ſtrongeſt marks of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of this proceſs. But nothing contributes more to the union of theſe ſubſtances than ſugar, as is well known in many<note n="*" place="bottom">Van Swieten relates a ſtory of a phyſician, who after enjoining a lady, as ſhe valued the life of her child, not to ſuffer him to taſte the ſmalleſt particle of ſugar, immediately preſcribed a mixture of a few ounces only in quantity, into which he directed an ounce of ſyrup to be put. He did not recollect that in all the officinal ſyrups, two thirds are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſugar. Van Swieten Comm. vol. v. p. 586.</note> pharmaceutical proceſſes, and the idea of this has been carried ſo far by ſome medical writers, as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that ſugar by rendering the<note n="†" place="bottom">Olea nimis ſolvendo macilentiam inducere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Boerhaave Elem, Chem. vol. ii. p. 160.</note> oily parts of our bodies more apt to paſs off by the excretories on account of their intimate union with the watery fluids, was apt to induce leanneſs, or a

General experience, however, has not ſhewn that ſugar produces any of theſe effects in any remarkable degree. Its moderate uſe appears to be at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and perhaps of all that have been yet diſcovered, it is the moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally innocent and inoffenſive, as well as the moſt ſimple ſweet.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0682000400:45"/>
            <p>The laſt I ſhall mention, and as I think the moſt exceptionable direction with reſpect to diet, is that of ſubſtituting brandy, or rum and water for common drink, in place of malt liquours, or other uſual liquid drank at meals, and to quench thirſt.</p>
            <p>This, I am ſorry to be obliged to obſerve, is now become too common a practice, and from being adviſed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſes, as a temporary expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient by ſome eminent practitioners, is now commonly directed in almoſt all caſes of weakneſs of the ſtomach and digeſtive organs by every apothecary, and that not as a thing of temporary neceſſity, but as a perpetual article of diet. I queſtion, however, if any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ever occurred in medicine more injurious to the ſcience, or fatal to mankind, than this unfortunate piece
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0682000400:46"/>of advice. Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ller<note n="*" place="bottom">Haller Phyſiolog. vol.vi. p. 251.</note> makes it a ſerious queſtion, if ſpirituous liquors are to be counted among the poiſonous or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal liquids, and laments the increaſe of their uſe throughout Europe, as a circumſtance highly prejudicial to the health of mankind. And it ſeems par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unfortunate, that at a period when the wiſdom and humanity of the legiſlature reſtrained the uſe of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors among the common people of this country, and alſo prevented the diſtribution of the ſame poiſon among the American Indians, on the fulleſt proofs and conviction of its miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous conſequenee, that the ſame prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in effect ſhould be adviſed by thoſe whoſe duty and profeſſion led them to ſtudy the health of their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0682000400:47"/>
            <p>Some may perhaps be of opinion that I have here expreſſed myſelf with greater warmth than the ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, but the melancholy events, to which I have myſelf been a witneſs, produced by this odious and inſidious practice, prompt me to expreſs my diſapprobation of it in the ſtrongeſt terms; but as I do not mean to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any practice without endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt to give ſome reaſons for ſo doing, I ſhall next examine the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that may be brought in favour of, or urged in objection to it.</p>
            <p>And firſt, it has been, alledged, that brandy, or rum and water may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly proportioned in point of ſtrength to malt drink, or any other liquour to which we have been accuſtomed, and of conſequence with reſpect to that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance muſt be equally innocent.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0682000400:48"/>
            <p>That it may be every where procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in tolerable perfection, and is hot liable to vary with the ſeaſon of the year, and other circumſtances which affect malt liquours, and inſtead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating improves by age.</p>
            <p>That it is itſelf incapable of either the vinous or acetous fermentation, and alſo checks it in other ſubſtances; whence it muſt be highly ſerviceable in ſtomachs wherein theſe fermentations are apt to be carried too far.</p>
            <p>That it is drank commonly in the Weſt Indies without any ill effects on the health or conſtitution.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the firſt of theſe I would obſerve, that though it be true that brandy or rum and water may be adjuſted in point of ſtrength (or its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0682000400:49"/>a proportionable quantity of alcohol or rectified ſpirit) to any other fermented liquour, that it is not on that account equally innocent, or indeed ſimilar in other reſpects. The fixible air is<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Hales found little or no fixible air in bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and it is a known fact, that vinous ſpirits will not precipitate lime water.</note> diſſipated in the diſtillation, the acid part evaporated, and the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſpirit and the water, when they are mixed for drinking, is much leſs uniform and perfect than in a regularly fermented liquor. On this account probably it is found to be leſs efficacious in exciting the ſecretions, to be leſs diuretic and aperient, and at the ſame time to poſſeſs a greater degree of inflammatory ſtimulus. Theſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are likely to be the cauſe of another effect of vinous ſpirits, viz. that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0682000400:50"/>much more apt to produce diſorders of the liver than wine or malt liquours.</p>
            <p>Another inconvenience of little appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſequence, but in reality very important, is, that the uſe of vinous ſpirits with water is exceedingly deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>Thoſe to whom this is recommended, begin with great care and caution to mix, with their own hands, the two liquours in proper proportion to each other. This preciſion, however, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in time tedious, and the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the proportion is intruſted to ſervants, who at firſt do it by meaſure, and ſoon after by gueſs, and quickly enlarge the proportion of ſpirit, which as it is done gradually is not perceived by the perſon who takes it, and they frequently proceed in this manner until
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0682000400:51"/>the<note n="*" place="bottom">This is ſo far the caſe, that I have myſelf more than once known ſix or ſeven quarts of brandy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in the ſpace of a week for many months, and even years together; and this by perſons who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined at the ſame time that they were ſtrictly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate; and what is more extraordinary, this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, frequently, though not always without any ſigns of intoxication.</note> ſpirit exceeds the water in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
            <p>The momentary relief, likewiſe, which this practice affords (as indeed all drams do) is an additional temptation to the continuation of it, and even to induce the unhappy ſufferer to take it at various periods through the day, and even in the morning, when ſuch liquors are peculiarly injurious; and this rather as a mode of relief, than as ſupplying a fluid for the purpoſes of drink. This is frequently the caſe with thoſe afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hypochondriacal or hyſterical
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0682000400:52"/>complaints, to whom they indeed afford a temporary relief in the dejections of ſpirits, to which they are ſubject, but who, on the contrary, the ſooneſt feel the ill effects ariſing from their habitual uſe.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond circumſtance men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in defence of this liquour, it is here of little conſequence, as malt drink or cyder may, almoſt in every part of this country, be procured in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable perfection.</p>
            <p>The next argument, that ſpirituous liquors are incapable both of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and acetous fermentations, and on that account are eligible for perſons of weak digeſtive faculties, is more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and deſerves greater attention.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0682000400:53"/>
            <p>Many of thoſe who give advice on this ſubject, and ſome writers ſeem to have conſidered the preſence of air in the inteſtines as being always a noxious circumſtance; but although this may ſometimes be the caſe when it is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated in too great quantities, it is far from being always ſo, as it ſerves ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral important purpoſes in the animal oeconomy.</p>
            <p>Air is probably the principal agent in exciting the periſtaltic motion of the inteſtines, by which the proceſs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and nutrition is carried on, and the food diſcharged. This motion is generally aſcribed to the ſtimulus of the food paſſing through them, and diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by its bulk, and by that irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation urging them to contraction.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0682000400:54"/>
            <p>But I apprehend, conſidering the length of the inteſtines, that the bulk of the food would be inſufficient were it not aſſiſted by air, with which the inteſtines of all animals newly killed are obſerved to be nearly filled.</p>
            <p>This affords a cauſe of irritation to the whole canal of the inteſtines, and keeps up the periſtaltic motion through them all. The air likewiſe thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, ſerves the purpoſe of a ſolid body in expelling, and alſo in collecting the faecal matter, ſo that it may be evacuated at proper intervals. Nor is air uſeful in the inteſtines merely on account of its mechanical properties; it is itſelf a powerful ſtimulus to the fibres of the tubes of a living animal.</p>
            <p>Haller found air equally powerful with the ſtrongeſt ſtimulants in excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0682000400:55"/>the motion of the heart and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and on that account concludes that it exerts a ſimilar power on the the ſtomach<note n="*" place="bottom">It is extraordinary that the proceſs of digeſtion ſhould have the effect of changing the air taken into the bowels or diſcharged from the food, into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable air, which is the caſe with the air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the inteſtines of animals.</note> and inteſtines.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that we may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be too anxious to guard againſt flatulence in our food, which caution is, I believe, often carried to a noxious length, and may, I conjecture, be not infrequently the cauſe of the coſtive habit which generally aggravates the diſorder, and which brandy and water is ſo apt to occaſion.</p>
            <p>The ſtomachs indeed of hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal perſons ſeem often to be oppreſſed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0682000400:56"/>with flatulence, as appears from their frequent eructations. But I have never ſeen theſe relieved by the uſe of brandy and water, as a liquour uſed for the purpoſe of drink; and indeed I believe they are often a convulſive ſpaſm of the ſtomach and oeſophagus, which from the cuſtom of its being encouraged on the idea of diſcharging what is noxious, becomes habitual. I have often ſeen this almoſt inſtantaneouſly produced by affections of the mind, and alſo relieved by cordials, without any diſcharge of wind; the former of which could have no effect in generating air, or the latter in abſorbing it.</p>
            <p>From the above account it ſeems probable, that the taking of ſpirituous liquours in this way is not likely to produce the good effects intended by it, and it is certainly often at leaſt lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0682000400:57"/>to the bad effects in a great meaſure of habitual dram drinking. This cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is well known to be generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, yet it may not be here impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to mention ſome of its effects that have been more particularly remarked.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Haller Phyſiol. Lib. XIX. §iii.</note> It contracts the ſtomach itſelf and the paſſage from the ſtomach into the inteſtines. It alſo renders the fibres of the ſtomach callous and fragile, and inſenſible to every ſtimulus, even that of hunger. It contracts the diameter of the vaſcular ſyſtem in general. It narrows the air veſſels of the lungs even to a third of their former ſize. It tends to coagulate all the humours of the body, the aqueous excepted. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces oſſifications of the tendons and arteries, and in ſome inſtances of the pleura itſelf, and often brings on
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0682000400:58"/>ſchirrhus of the whole viſcera and glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular ſyſtem. It induces alſo tremors, convulſions, and palſy of the nervous ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Theſe effect of the abuſe of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors, are delivered by a<note n="*" place="bottom">Haller.</note> writer of eminence and candour, and are far from appearing to be exaggerated, as undoubtedly many more might be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be objected that all the foregoing bad conſequences have been produced by the abuſe of ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liquours in general, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that an exceſs in the latter is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo habitual, or ſo frequently repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the former from it's conſtant uſe is likely to be. That the conſtitutions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0682000400:59"/>of thoſe who indulge in the uſe of wine or malt liquours are in general more robuſt than thoſe who uſe brandy or rum and water. That the uſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, even diluted to a proportionable ſtrength, is not, as has been before obſerved, equally innocent with wine or malt liquours, but more inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and in every reſpect more apt to occaſion the diſorders above recited, thoſe of the liver particularly.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That the uſe of ſpirits in this way is more dangerous, as being more deluſive and apt to be indulged in, as being often adviſed by the faculty, and the conſequences of an exceſs are not ſo immediately aſcribed to their true cauſe, as in the other inſtance, and of courſe not ſo likely to be guarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0682000400:60"/>
            <p>As to the laſt mentioned plea in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of this kind of liquour, that it is taken without any inconvenience by the natives of the Weſt India iſlands as their uſual drink, I would obſerve, that though the fact be as repreſented, yet that the circumſtances are by no means ſimilar. The inhabitants of the Weſt India iſlands uſe this liquour in a great meaſure from neceſſity; malt drink not being procurable, and ſcarce any wine, Madeira excepted, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being kept to a proper age with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out turning sour.</p>
            <p>Next, They are very cautious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the quality of their liquour, and alſo as to the ſtrength of their uſual drink, which is always very weak in reſpect of the proportion of ſpirit, which is regularly obſerved, and alſo it is always joined with a conſiderable
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0682000400:61"/>portion of the juice of ſome acid fruit, as limes, lemons, oranges, &amp;c. and with ſugar, which not only correct the heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualities of the ſpirit, but diſpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the liquour to paſs off by the proper ſecretions.</p>
            <p>Rum and water thus corrected is alſo adapted to theſe climates on another account, as being a thin liquour, and free of all viſcidity or tenacity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently better ſuited to paſs off by the thinner ſecretions, as urine and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration (the latter of which is very copious, and neceſſary to be conſtantly kept up) than malt liquour, or the more viſcid wines, even though they could be had in perfection.</p>
            <p>The vegetable diet alſo upon which the inhabitants of theſe iſlands, from the heat of the climate in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0682000400:62"/>live, is alſo a conſiderable preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the ill effects of ſpirituous liquours.</p>
            <p>The diſorders which the latter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce are generally of the bilious or liver kind, or at leaſt firſt appear in that form; and for the cure of theſe, the juices of freſh vegetables are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially adapted, which probably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents many of the ill conſequences which would otherwiſe probably accrue from the conſtant uſe of this liquour. But the perſons in England to whom the taking of ſpirits with water is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, are in general prohibited from touching any vegetable food: a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſuch caſes doubly injurious, and I make no doubt that this reſtraint often greatly enhances the ill effects of the uſe of the ſpirits; and I think I have almoſt always obſerved, that thoſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0682000400:63"/>who live in this way, ſoon acquire a yellow bilious complexion, which is often attributed to the complaint, but I doubt not is much more frequently owing to the manner of life.</p>
            <p>Such are ſeveral of the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies which frequently occur from the abuſe of this article of diet, to which catalogue, though many more might be added, yet the above are, I truſt, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to put us on our guard againſt its being raſhly adopted.</p>
            <p>I hope indeed that the practice will daily decreeſe, and with its diminution, I doubt not the health of the people will improve, or as Haller expreſſes himſelf on an occaſion not very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <q>"In Anglia certe, poſtquam pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum de ſuo furore plebs remiſit, ipſi
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0682000400:64"/>mores, &amp; valetudo civium in melius revertuntur."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have thus finiſhed my remarks on ſeveral articles of diet uſually recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to valetudinarians. But at the ſame time that I condemn many of the directions on account of their being incautiouſly adviſed, I do not deny that ſeveral of the above reſtrictions, even the laſt, which I think the moſt exceptionable, may be <hi>ſometimes</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: but I believe that ſuch neceſſity very ſeldom occurs, and that we ought to be fully ſatisfied of its exiſtence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a practice be recommended. It is not every trifling complaint of the ſtomach that will juſtify ſuch advice, which indeed, in my opinion, ſhould never be given but on the fulleſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, not only that the common mode of living diſagreed, but alſo that ſome
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0682000400:65"/>relief was gained by the change, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an aſſurance of which it ought not to be continued; nor ſhould ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen be at all commenced without the matureſt conſideration and advice of the moſt experienced of the faculty, who will always think it an unfortunate circumſtance to be obliged to preſcribe ſuch rules which they will only recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend for a limited period, and will as ſoon as poſſible adviſe to be diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and the uſual and natural courſe of life to be reſumed.</p>
