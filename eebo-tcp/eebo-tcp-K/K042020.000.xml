            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Almoſt within the Frigid Zone of fate.</l>
            <l>Can ſhiv'ring fancy fondly hope to riſe,</l>

            <l>'Tis madneſs to attempt—yet REASON, proud,</l>
            <l>With God-like energy thus cries aloud:</l>
            <l>' Let fools the deity of FORTUNE own;</l>
            <l>' I view alike a cottage or a throne.</l>
            <l>' Intrinſic worth, alone, has charms for me;</l>
            <l>' The worth of virtue, and of liberty.</l>
            <l>' Rouze, then, nor let an apathy of ſoul,</l>
            <l>' Thy active free-born faculties controul:</l>
            <l>' Behold aright the attributes of ſtate;</l>
            <l>' They are not always happy, who are great.</l>
            <l>' Invoke CONTENT to ſoothe thy troubled mind,</l>
            <l>' CONTENT, the opulence of human kind,</l>
            <l>' That like the tuneful herald of the morn,</l>
            <l>' When roſy-tinctur'd beams the Eaſt adorn,</l>
            <l>' From his graſs pallat mounts on cow'ring wings,</l>

            <p>THOUGH the Prologue ſhews the motive of this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may not be improper to mention, that it was firſt hinted to the Author by a Noble Perſonage, who has eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the literary world; and who recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to have heard Mr. SOUTHERNE declare, in his latter days, that he moſt heartily regretted his complying with licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious taſte, by writing any thing ſo offenſive to modeſty, as the comic part of his works; eſpecially that which was ſo unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally joined to the tragedy of this play.</p>
            <p>The Author thinks himſelf obliged, in gratitude, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the very candid reception <hi>his</hi> part of it met with from the polite and judicious audience of EDINBURGH, without one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to recommend it, as he choſe to lie concealed; and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is the more extraordinary, as the piece laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome lamentable deficiencies in the repreſentation.</p>
