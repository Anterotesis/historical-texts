            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it is to be noted, that Tar already uſed is of a

the latter being thinner, mixeth eaſier with

Difference between old Tar or new Tar, or
which of all the various Tars, produced from
different Trees, or in different Parts of the

ſuch foul Caſes, which I have tried with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,

For inveterate Caſes of that Kind, Tar Water

applied Outwardly, and warm, by bathing,
fomenting, and ſteeping, to heal and dry up

               <p>My Experiments have been made in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Caſes, and on many Perſons; and I make
no doubt its Virtues will ſoon be more fully
diſcovered, as Tar-water is now growing into
general Uſe, tho' not without that Oppoſition
which uſually attends upon Novelty. The
great Objection I find made to this Medicine is,
that it promiſes too much. What, ſay the
Objectors, do you pretend to a Panacea, a thing
ſtrange, chimerical, and contrary to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Experience of all Mankind. Now to
ſpeak out, and, give this Objection or Queſtion
a direct Anſwer, I freely own that I ſuſpect
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0440900900:8"/>
Tar-water is a Panacea. I may be miſtaken,
but it is worth trial; for the Chance of ſo great
and general a Benefit, I am willing to ſtand
the Ridicule of propoſing it. And as the old
Philoſopher cried aloud, from the Houſe-top,
to his Fellow Citizens, <hi>educate your Children</hi>;
ſo, I confeſs, if I had a Situation high enough,
and a Voice loud enough, I would cry out, to
all the Valetudinarians upon Earth, <hi>drink Tar

               <p>Having thus frankly owned the Charge,
I muſt explain to you, that by a Panacea is
not meant a Medicine which cures all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals,
(this conſiſts not with Mortality)
but a Medicine that cures or relieves all the
different Species of Diſtempers. And if God
hath given us ſo great a Bleſſing, and made a
Medicine ſo cheap and plentiful as Tar, to
be withal ſo univerſal in its Effects, to eaſe
the Miſeries of human Life, ſhall Men be

Putrefaction; that it hath the Virtues
of Turpentine, which in Medicine are known
to be very great and manifold; but I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
withal, that Turpentines or Balſams
are very offenſive in the taking: I therefore
conſidered diſtinctly the ſeveral conſtituent
Parts of Balſams; which were thoſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the medicinal Virtues reſided and which
were to be regarded, rather as a Viſcous
Matrix to receive, arreſt, and retain the
more volatile and active Particles. And if
theſe laſt could be ſo ſeparated and diſengaged
from the groſſer Parts, as to impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
a clear and potable Liquor, I concluded
that ſuch Liquor muſt prove a Medicine of
great Force, and general Uſe. I conſidered,
that Nature was the beſt Chemiſt and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parer

and Flavour of Tar argued very active Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities

To do Juſtice to Tar Water, as well as
to thoſe who drink it, Regard muſt be had
to the particular Strength and Caſe of the
Patients. Grievous or inveterate Maladies
muſt not be treated as common Caſes. I
cured a horrible Caſe, a Gangrene in the
Blood, which had broke out in ſeveral Sores,
and threatened ſpeedy Death, by obliging the
Perſon to drink nothing but this Liquor for
ſeveral Weeks, as much and as often as his
Stomach would bear. Common Senſe will
direct a proportionable Conduct in other
Caſes. But this muſt be left to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

ANSWER
TO
A
LETTER
To the Right Reverend
The BISHOP of CLOYNE. Occaſioned by
His Treatiſe of TAR-WATER.</head>
               <p>WHEN a Gentleman had propoſed a
Medicine to the World, which from
repeated Experience he had found to be of
ſingular Efficacy, one would think he had a
Right to be heard with Candour, if not with
Applauſe. But the Author of a Letter to the
Biſhop of <hi>Cloyne,</hi> has attack'd him in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as much below the Character of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to offer, as a Biſhop to receive. It is,
to ſay the leaſt of it, what the Author profeſſes
it to be, with the UTMOST FREEDOM. He
compares him to a <hi>Quack, a boaſting Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0440900900:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Dr. <hi>Salmon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Rock,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">'There is, my Lord, another Being (whom I have have more Reverence than' to name in your Lordſhip's Company, and whoſe Actions, nothing but the <hi>perfect Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equality</hi> of the <hi>Alluſion</hi> can attone for my mentioning with your Lordſhip's) who can cite Scripture for his Purpoſe.' <hi>Letter,</hi> p. 27.</note>.
Himſelf the World will probably gueſs to be a
Phyſician. A <hi>thorough bread Man,</hi> no doubt;
and, I ſuppoſe, the great Point be has in view
is to lie half diſcovered, half concealed, ready
to be called forth from his preſent Obſcurity
into Practice, when he has raiſed a Character
by demoliſhing a Writer of Eminence.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Phyſician</hi> as he ſuppoſes the World will
take him to be, I much doubt whether it may
mot give to the Biſhop, even in <hi>that Reſpect,</hi>
the Preference. To make a Science a <hi>Noſtrum,</hi>
is as <hi>quackiſh</hi> as to make a Medicine one.
Knowledge is open to every Man of Senſe and
Application; and has the Biſhop ſhewn his
Want of either in his Study of Phyſic, tho' it
is not more immediately his Profeſſion? How
frequently have Phyſicians turn'd Divines?
where is the Abſurdity for a Divine to become
a Phyſician? Is the Pale of Phyſic only ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
that it admits of no Interlopers? What
then does this <hi>Gentleman</hi> mean, when he tells
us<note n="b" place="bottom">Page 36.</note>, <hi>the principal Points of Knowledge neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to a Phyſician, are</hi> NATURALLY <hi>wanting</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0440900900:20"/>
                  <hi>in a Divine</hi>? Alas! it is not the Degree, or
the Robe, the tye Wig, or the Gold-headed
Cane, that makes the Phyſician, anymore than.
Prunella the Parſon. But the Knowledge of
either may be concealed under every Habit,
and the ſeven Sciences contained without a
College Title.</p>
               <p>Need I produce Authority or Example for
this? the two great Names of <hi>Bacon</hi> and <hi>Boyle</hi>
will be laſting Monuments, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Phyſic is not confined to thoſe of the
Profeſſion only.</p>
               <p>But the Letter-Writer ſays<note n="c" place="bottom">Page 36.</note>, He cannot
<hi>gueſs,</hi> from any Part of the Biſhop's Treatiſe,
<hi>that he ever made Phyſic his Study.</hi> Many
others ſay, he talks as rationally of it as thoſe
that have. This Author himſelf obſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ves<note n="d" place="bottom">Page 37.</note>,
That he has <hi>ſearched the Books of Phyſicians
for Hiſtories of Diſeaſes,</hi> and to find out <hi>the
peculiar</hi> Properties <hi>of Medicines</hi>; no ſmall Part
of a Phyſician's Learning, as much, I believe,
as many an one ſets up on. But becauſe the
Biſhop has applied it to the magnifying his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
Medicine, this Author will not allow
him to have made any Improvement from his
Reſearches.</p>
               <p>Will it be ſaid, that Phyſic has eluded his
Labours, becauſe the Theory of it is more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0440900900:21"/>
extenſive than any other? The World has ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
judged very differently. And, if we
conſider how ſacredly the Avenues to this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
are guarded, by myſteriouſly preſcribbing
Things unknown in an unknown Tongue, how
it is converſant with Mankind in its weakeſt
State, when the Mind is drooping, and catches
at any Thing that promiſes Relief, the whole
Faculty ought with <hi>Humility and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
to acknowledge the Reputation the World
has given them. Nay, I would appeal to this
very Writer, whether he is not perſuaded, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a regular Phyſician's Practice does not depend
more on his Addreſs to the Whims and Foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of his Patients, than his real Skill in his
profeſſion. I ask this, when he has compar'd
his own Merit with his Practice. I know his
<hi>natural</hi> Pride will extort from him what his
<hi>artificial</hi> Pride would tempt him to conceal.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Study</hi> has not the Biſhop
join'd <hi>Experience</hi>? Experience founded on
his own unbounded Generoſity to the Poor,
itself an Hoſpital without adventitious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.
And is he not to be believ'd, when
he tells us, without Fee or Reward, he has
known, frequently known, after repeated Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
upon various Conſtitutions, his Medicine
prove ſucceſsful? The Letter-Writer ſays the
Facts were all<note n="d" place="bottom">Page 36.</note> 
                  <hi>miſunderſtood,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

                  <hi>Water is no Medicine, ſomething</hi> HARDLY
<hi>worth the Name of one, and that it can care
no one Diſeaſe.</hi> Nay, to make ſure Work, and
to be as far in one Extreme as the Biſhop in
the, other, That it can do no Good<note n="f" place="bottom">Page 20.</note>, but
may do Harm. He aſſures us <hi>Cold Water
oured on Tar can take none, not the leaſt of
its Medicinal Virtues</hi>: That, <hi>if we ask the
Chemiſt, he will tell us,</hi> "Oil cannot be mix'd with, or drawn forth by Cold Water." Now
in Obedience to this Gentleman I have <hi>ask'd</hi>
the Chemiſt, and he tells me, that ſome of
<hi>the Virtues of the Oil of Tar may be drawn
forth by Cold Water.</hi> And I have actually
taſted Water, wherein the Oil of Tar was
waſhed (two Ounces to a Pint) ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued
with its Virtues, and which had much
the ſame Taſte with Water wherein the Oil
of <hi>Benzoin</hi> was waſhed. In Analyzing Tar
there are found to come over ſome fine Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
ſo quick with the Oil that they cannot be
ſeparated, which may be communicated to
Water. And it is well known, all Acids will
imbibe ſome Part of the Flowers, or fineſt
Part of the Oil of all Reſinous Subſtances.
As it may afford ſome Satisfaction to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Writer,
and enable others to determine
more particularly the Virtues of Tar, I ſhall

So that, we ſee, after all this mighty Parade

afterwards for its Seaſon, before this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's

The reſt of his Letter is chiefly taken

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0440900900:27"/>
ſhall only obſerve almoſt as odd an one in this
Writer's Letter. As an Inſtance how the Senſe
of Words may be perverted, he tells us a Story
of great Effects<note n="a" place="bottom">Page 28.</note> produced by a trifling Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Pointing. "Inſtead of <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſaying,
<hi>I have killed a Man</hi> with a Colon at the
End, which makes it a Confeſſion of Guilt,
only write it thus, <hi>I have killed a Man.</hi>"
Where is the Difference? This Story, it
ſeems made him <hi>wonder,</hi> when he heard it,
and it makes the Reader <hi>ſtare,</hi> when he reads it.
It ſhould be, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Have I killed a Man.</hi>
But when he tells us how the fame Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
came to ſtand in his ſecond Edition, as well
as in his firſt, we may find out perhaps how
<hi>Tar and Honey</hi> came to be in the <hi>Index</hi> only.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop having illuſtrated how Acid
are ſheathed by Alkalies from a Simile of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
and Faucets, this Author's Modeſty I
much offended at it. Hail! <hi>Woodward</hi> lives
I cannot but admire, ſaies he, <hi>the perfect
Decency of your Lordſhip's Manner, your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Cleaneſs as well as Delicacy in</hi> Sm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lles.
Which reminds me of the Lady that
could not bear a Chapter of hard Names
for Fear there ſhould be ſome what immodeſ
in them.</p>
               <p>But it is not enough that he cut down the
Biſhop in Phyſic, unleſs he makes Repriſals
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0440900900:28"/>
upon him in Divinity. He charges him
with making the Scriptures ſerve the Turn
of his Philoſophy <hi>by new Tranſlaitions, and
even where there was no need of it.</hi> This, I
ſuppoſe, alludes to §. 179. where the Biſhop
obſerves that the Paſſage in the Pſalms, <hi>who
maketh his Miniſters a flaming Fire,</hi> might as
well be rendered, and more agreeably to the
Context, <hi>who maketh flaming Fire his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
If it is more agreeable to the Context,
why will this Author ſay, <hi>There was no need
of the Alteration</hi>? And, as to the Charge of
Novelty, there is ſcarce a Commentator but
gives the Paſſage the ſame Conſtruction, tho'
they have nothing to do with the Biſhiop's
Hypotheſis. Without a Pomp of Quotations,
I recommend only to this Author's Polite
Taſte, <hi>Buchanan's</hi> Verſion; or, if that is more
ſuitable to it, <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Apparent accinctae <hi>AURAE FLAMMAEQUE</hi>
miniſtrae.</q>
               <p>In the ſame Place he ſaies, <hi>I ſhall only
commemorate to your Lordſhip's Honour as a
Biſhop, that you can ſoften Atheiſm into Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction.</hi>
Ay, and this very Lordſhip he
<hi>honours and reſpects,</hi> As A Bishop, <hi>whom as a
Physician he deſpiſes.</hi> It is plain, his <hi>perſonal
Charity</hi> is as great as his <hi>publick Zeal,</hi> which
could prompt him to conſute an Author, half
dead as he was with the Fatigues of Practice
which that very Author had helped him to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0440900900:29"/>
But how has his Lordſhip been guilty of
leſſening Atheiſm? Why he has vindicated,
it ſeems, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and ſome other Philoſophers
from that Imputation, by ſhewing how their
Principles have been miſtaken. Atheiſm the
Biſhop leaves juſt what it was; but ſhews thoſe
Venerable Sages did not come within the Verge
of it. Where is the Harm? If we will not
take them as Partners of our Natural Creed,
another Sett of Men will be proud of them.
Here our Author's Zeal gets the better of his
Charity, and he betrays a little of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable
Temper by which he excluded the Clergy from the
College of Phyſicians, ſome
of whom, I am perſuaded, cure more than
many a Licentiate. From the ſame Turn of
Mind he ſeems proud to characteriſe himſelf
at parting, when he lets the Biſhop know
what he ſhould have done to have prevented
the Attacks of ſo formidable an Adverſary:
Then, ſaies he,<note n="b" place="bottom">Page 37.</note> 
                  <hi>No carping Wit or ſour
Pbiloſopher would have dared to have blamed you.</hi>
