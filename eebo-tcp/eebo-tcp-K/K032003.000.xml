            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Intention of the following Pages, with Difference to your illuſtrious Body, is with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion laid at your Feet, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other Views along with it, than to promote, the further Knowledge of <hi>medicine,</hi> the exact and artful Compoſition of which is ſo highly Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and conducive to the Welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the Utility of the Publick.</p>
            <p>I REST aſſured of a candid Reception from the Nature of the Deſign, which I have the vanity to think you will favour, becauſe it is only level'd at a Reformation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0198001400:3"/>ſome of the Errors in Compoſition that have crept into former, and are ſtill retain'd in your laſt Edition of the <hi>London Diſpenſatory,</hi> and a further Recommendation of the many excellent Preſcriptions, which you have with Juſtice to the <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> continued and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd to the World, all which I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſupport by Authority, Reaſon and Experience; hence, I flatter myſelf with every thing that can be expected from a <hi>Society</hi> ſo diſtinguiſh'd for univerſal Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, as well as their particular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Medicine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a meer Trifle which I offer, only as an Eſſay to what I have ready for the Preſs, and to which I doubt not of your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Approbation; for as 'the Study of your Lives is devoted to do Good, ſo you will certainly promote every Thing that tends to that great End; and what is of more Importance than to preſerve Life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to Man that valuable Bleſſing of Health?</p>
            <p>THIS Collection of <hi>Antidotes,</hi> altho', no <hi>Epidemical Diſeaſe</hi> ſhould happen (which God in his Mercy avert) is of univerſal Tendency, and ſpeaks for itſelf: The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were all Phyſicians of great Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſome of whom liv'd thro' five or ſix <hi>Plagues,</hi> in which they had been ſingularly ſucceſsful; and after that devouring Flame was Extinguiſh'd, they had in all their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Practice, ſtill a mighty Eſteem for ſuch Antidotes and Alexipharmicks as had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0198001400:4"/>been Serviceable to them, when they ſtood ſo much in need of their Aſſiſtance, on which Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion they invented and introduced a whole Set or Collection of 'em, into Practice among which you have the various Preſcriptions of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh's</hi> great Cordial, that of Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby's</hi> Diaphoretick, Gaſcoyne Powder, with the Goa-Stone, and a great Variety of the <hi>Lapis Contrayerva,</hi> with many others; all which are very valuable in their Kinds, and conſequently, I doubt not but the Publication of this will meet with a Reception equal to the Merits of thoſe learned Gentlemen, who were the Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the ſeveral Recipe's and Preſcriptions therein contain'd, which were certainly Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and found Uſeful for the publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>NOW, let, me beg leave of your learned <hi>Society</hi> to make ſome decent and modeſt Remarks upon your laſt Edition, of your <hi>Pharmacopeia</hi> that from the Juſtneſs of thoſe Obſervations, you yourſelves may Judge of the Neceſſity there is for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſame, and from the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens I ſhall give, make the World ſenſible of the Uſefulneſs of ſuch an Undertaking, which, with the laſt Regards due to your venerable Body, I ſubmit to impartial Judgment. And in the firſt Place, I ſhall not waſt Time, either upon the Method, or Materials you have made Choice of in the Simples conducive to your <hi>Diſpenſatory,</hi> whether Roots, Barks, Woods, Herbs, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0198001400:5"/>Fruits, Seeds or the like, but do think it wou'd have been a Juſtice due to the Publick, as well as an Advantage to the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> to have inform'd them, which of thoſe Simples moſt conſtantly are in Uſe, which are ſeldom uſed, and which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed at all; which Things are very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, that Time and Money may not be thrown away upon what is perfectly Uſeleſs; as the Roots of Anthorae an Exotick, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Counter-poiſon to Monkſhood, not Traffick'd in, and of no Virtues that are recommended by the Experience of the Faculty. 2dly. Arundinis Saccharina; the common Reed and Sugar-Cane Roots of no Medicinal uſe. The Roots of Kings Spear or Aſphodel, Male and Female, not Us'd or even Sold in the Druggiſt, or Apothecaries Shops, and many more.</p>
            <p>THE next are thoſe which, are ſeldom, or very rarely uſed, ſuch as the <hi>Hermodactyls,</hi> Woad, Fullers Thiſtle, Hog-Fennel, Stinking Gladon, and an hundred others mention'd to little or no Purpoſe, which had been better left out, both for the eaſe of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, and the Preſcriber, who is at firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs'd in ſo large a Field of Materials, loaded by ſome Authors with great Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums of the Feats they have done in Phyſick, which are too apt to flatter and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſappoint the Preſumptions of a young Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioner.</p>
            <p>I SHALL paſs by the reſt of the Simples in this ſhort Account, and leave 'em to a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0198001400:6"/>ſtricter Enquiry, when I come to publiſh the <hi>Pharmacopeia Reformata,</hi> and ſo proceed to ſome more material Obſervations, among which, I ſhall firſt take Notice of, the Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel ſcilliticum, which you have Preſcrib'd juſt in the ſame manner as formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> Three <hi>Pounds of Clarified Honey, to two Pounds of Vinegar of Squills;</hi> whereas in Juſtneſs to the Operation, and Effects of this <hi>Medicine,</hi> here ſhould be three Pounds of Vinegar of <hi>Squills,</hi> to two Pounds of Honey, otherwiſe the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine</hi> is ſo clogg'd with the Honey, that the Efficacy thereof is loſt, and the <hi>Acetum</hi> hath not power to aſſiſt the Digeſtion, cut the viſcous Flegm, diſcharge Wind and ſour Belchings from the Stomach, and ſtrengthen the Appetite; for which it is a noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, was it not ſo very Nauſeous; but it may be excellently adapted by a skillful and judicious Phyſician, who by mixing equal parts of the <hi>Acetum ſcilliticum</hi> and Oxymel will gain his Intentions.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT be ſurpriz'd that you have overlook'd this among ſo many other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which are ſo Faulty, that they are not capable of being made up or if they could, wou'd be of no Uſe, ſince you are pleas'd to perſiſt in your daily Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to preſcribe Galbanum along with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum, in order to be diſſolv'd, in black Cherry-water, or other the like Vehicle, and are angry with the Apothecary, when he tells you plain, that he knows not how to diſſolve <hi>Galbanum</hi> in an aqueous Body,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0198001400:7"/>tho' <hi>Ammoniacum</hi> will familiarly do it; if this Point had been clear'd up in your laſt Edition, of the <hi>London Diſpenſatory,</hi> and new Rules given to the Apothecary, how to make his Diſſolution of <hi>Galbanum,</hi> this wou'd have been a great Improvement, and given a New turn to the Diſpenſations of Medicines, but till then, we ſhall believe it was not ſo artfully Corrected, as we had Reaſon to expect from Perſons ſo well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd; otherwiſe the <hi>Spiritus Lavendulae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitus</hi> would hardly have remain'd in the Condition it ſtands, conſidering it is ſuch a <hi>Farrago</hi> of inconſiſtences unskilfully blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Produce of which, is nothing at all; when at the ſame time the ſimple Spirit of Lavender, is ſo excellently uſeful, and may be enrich'd at the Phyſician's pleaſure, with all the Volatile Aromaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Nature of the Caſe, becoming by this Means a <hi>Spiritus Lavendulae Extemporaneo Compoſitus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOUR <hi>Aqua Paeoniae Compoſita,</hi> or Peony-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Compound, is an excellent Preſcription, but wants much of what it was from <hi>Langius,</hi> who calls it his <hi>Epileptick Water,</hi> which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt I ſhall give you (as it was Originally) in the <hi>Pharmacopeia Reformata;</hi> in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim it is high time to expunge <hi>Gilbert's Water,</hi> leaſt ſome evil minded People ſhou'd deceive themſelves, and others, in putting their Truſt therein.</p>
            <p>As to the Treacle of <hi>Audromachus,</hi> and <hi>Mithridate,</hi> of which I can find no Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in your laſt Edition; it is one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0198001400:8"/>grand Medley of a multitude of Simples jumbl'd together without Order or Deſign; the greateſt Part of which are either uſeleſs, or ineffectual. I ſhall ſatisfie my own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion only to declare that as generally us'd, and apply'd, they are both dangerous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines ill prepar'd, very Hot and of diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Qualities to the Intentions they are adminiſtred. The grand Reaſon that has induc'd all Sorts of People to the Uſe of them, have been drawn from the Authority and Experience of the Antients; <hi>Galen</hi> ſays they, hath ſpoken in Praiſe of <hi>Treacle</hi> in two Pieces of his, directed to <hi>Piſo,</hi> and <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus.</hi> To which I anſwer, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity cited, is of no force, becauſe they do not appear to be <hi>Galen's</hi> Writings, but falſly attributed to him, which is the more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Stile and Manner of Writing, which is foreign from that of <hi>Galen's,</hi> beſides there are ſeveral Terms, and Words made Uſe of not elſewhere to be found in the ſaid Author's Works, according to the learn'd <hi>Mercurialis,</hi> who ſays, <hi>in eo plurima verba a Galeno nuſquam uſurpata, fabuloſae aliqua &amp; ſtylus totus pene diverſus reperiuntur.</hi> The ſame Author ſays, there ought not to be the leaſt Fault in any of the Simples, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Compoſition, ſpeaking of <hi>Treacle Vitium enim unius Medicamenti totum Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem evertit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY Body knows the great Abuſe in the Choice of Vipers, and that of the <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathrum,</hi> which not one in an hundred makes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0198001400:9"/>a right Uſe of; beſides this, the <hi>Myrrh</hi> we uſe, ſetting aſide the ſmell, is nothing like that deſcrib'd by <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> but rather <hi>Bdelliams,</hi> whereas the Troglotick is the fame, and we have no <hi>Opo-Balſamum,</hi> true <hi>Coſtus, Schaenanth, Dictamny</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> or <hi>Falernian Wine.</hi> The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the <hi>Opium</hi> us'd at this Day, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near ſo fine, or good as <hi>Mathiolus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and ſcarce ſeems to be like what <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> deſcribes: For it is a perfect <hi>Meconium</hi> at this Day, as may be evidently Proved,</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Mithridate</hi> commonly met with in the Shops, is in the ſame Condition, having the ſame Faults and Imperfections, and therefore ought to be rejected, being too hot and acrid for the Intentions it is generally Preſcrib'd, conſequently it wants a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Reformation, or elſe ought to be expung'd the <hi>Diſpenſatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Confection of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> altho' ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prudently diveſted of its Perfumes now a-days, is a Compoſition very unartfully Invented and Deſcrib'd by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and very little Reform'd and Amended by the Moderns, who ſtill cloſely purſue the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the <hi>Arabian Phyſicians:</hi> Indeed the <hi>Lapis Laruli</hi> has been long ſince thrown out, and there remains little behind in this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which bears a high Name, but what we may expect from the Juice or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of the <hi>Chermes-Berry</hi> with better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; for as to the <hi>Aloes Wood,</hi> we know little or nothing of it, and the Leaf-Gold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0198001400:10"/>is a meer Amuſement to Deceive the Credulous. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> inſtead of ſpeaking in its Praiſe gives a ſevere Caution againſt the Uſe of it, which is Back'd by Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> who blames Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians for the too plentiful Preſcribing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: See the <hi>Annotations</hi> and <hi>Obſervations</hi> of Mr. <hi>Guillemeau.</hi> The Confect of <hi>Hyacinth</hi> bears a great Reſemblance to this, only that the laſt ſeems to be endowed with no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Virtue at all: Notwithanding the great Boaſts made of it, from the Fragments of Precious-Stones, that enter the Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the ſplendid ſhew of which, together, with the Leaf-Gold, many are induced to believe it is capable of performing Wonders.</p>
            <p>AS I was treating of <hi>Mithridate,</hi> I muſt take the Liberty to return to the Subject, to ſhew that when <hi>Pompey</hi> found the Receipt thereof written in <hi>Mithridates</hi> own Hand, after the Defeat of that Prince, which he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd as a vaulable Secret; it was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded but of very few Simples, and thoſe very common ones according to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Diſtick.</hi>

            <p>THIS Compoſition then conſiſted, only of two Walnuts, two Figs, Twenty leaves of <hi>Rue</hi> ſtamp'd together, with a little Salt; and this was reckon'd a ſovereign Antidote againſt any maglignant Air for 24 Hours together, it being ſufficient for three or four Morning Doſes, drinking after it a Glaſs of white Wine</p>
            <p>THE next thing to be enquir'd into, is to know the Reaſon, why you ſtill admit Leaf-Gold into ſeveral Preparations, ſince you very well know it is neither Cordial, Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borative, Alterative, or does it any wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Nutrition of the Parts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Galen,</hi> in his Commentary on the firſt Book of <hi>Hippocrates, de ratione Victus in Acutis.</hi> It can by no Means be call'd an Alterative, in that the natural Diſpoſition of the Body cannot be affected by Reaſon of the Solidity of its Parts, ſo that it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heat or cool, dry or moiſten the ſolid, or fluid Parts, and how it becomes Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive I cannot imagine; all which makes good what <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaliger,</hi> ſays in his Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations againſt <hi>Cardan</hi> Exerc. 272. There ought to be ſome Reſemblance, ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Configuration of Parts; between what gives the Nutriment, and the Body that receives it. Metals are proper to unite with, and feed Metals, but are imcompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and foreign to the ſubſiſtence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Animals. If Gold is good in any Diſeaſe, it muſt certainly be ſo in the <hi>Hypochondriack, Melancholy,</hi> eſpecially when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0198001400:12"/>it is adminiſtred, not as the <hi>Arabians,</hi> in Pills or Powders, or as the Chymiſts in Potions like their <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> but plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in Specie, or Golden Showers; nay, if the Phyſician cou'd but preſcribe <hi>Bank</hi> Bills, his preſcriptions would infallibly Cure all the Vapours in Town. This is a Specifick, even againſt <hi>South-Sea</hi> Head-Ach, which, is otherwiſe an incurable Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>AND here I cannot forbear to hint at the preſent uſe of <hi>Ivory,</hi> that is ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and recommended in many good Medicines, when every Body knows, and is thoroughly perſwaded that <hi>Harts-Horn,</hi> has an hundred times the Virtue, ſince the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neither diſcovers Smell or Taſte, or any Quality to recommend it for an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious Medicine; ſeveral Phyſicians have long ſince exploded it, as <hi>Durel Hantin, Mercurialis, Baccius, Sylvaticus Eraſtus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus, Sebizius,</hi> and others; but <hi>Ambroſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> by dint of Reaſon and Experience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes, all the pretended and imaginary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities aſſign'd to this uſeleſs and inſignificant Drug.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE it becomes more my Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that Gentlemen who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and weigh'd all theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Balance of Reaſon, ſhould ſtill continue the Uſe of many uſeleſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Drugs, which are now directed in the ſeveral Compoſitions of your <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> many of which are rarely, or not to be got at all, and others at a very dear Rate,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0198001400:13"/>and good for little or nothing; the firſt of which I mean is, the Bone of a Stags Heart, the others are Ambergreeſe, Musk, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar ſo frequently preſcribed on all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the laſt of which there are ſo many vile Cheats practic'd, that it is a pity it ſhould lye in the power of avaritious, and deſigning Men to Cozen and Deceive the World, with ſuch vile Frauds.</p>
            <p>TWO Parts in three of the Bezoar, of which is ſold and made Uſe of in the Shops is, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious, and the other that is Natural, is only fit to Deceive ſuch as are willing to be Deceiv'd, and take a Pleaſure to be carry'd down with the Stream of popular Errors. As to the Factitious, it is generally made up of <hi>Gall-Stones,</hi> found in the Gall-Bladders of Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Lemnian Earth</hi> findly ground with a little <hi>Ambergreeſe,</hi> and ſo form'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Stones of various Sizes and Figures; and thus the ſubtle Artiſt cheats the Apothecary with his Counterfeit Stone, and the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an comes into the Confederacy, by preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Bezoartick Bolus, or Powder to pick the Patient's Pocket: This fallacy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credulous Sick, will in a little time become as deſpicable, as the vain Pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Alchymiſts,</hi> with their <hi>Aurum Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> their <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> and <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Projection,</hi> with which they Bubble the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and blind the Eyes of the more diſcerning part of Mankind.</p>
            <p>I HOPE to God, that you Gentlemen, who have both Honour, Juſtice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0198001400:14"/>will put a ſtop to theſe Deceits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the People are Cheated with falſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which under the pompous Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of curing more Effectually, are made a Handle of, to extract Gold and Silver from the Patients Purſe: A Reformation of theſe things would be a great Advantage to all Parties, and who can we expect it from, but your learned Body, who by your Example, and Authority have Power to Reform, and at the ſame time inform the World what your Opinions are in relation to ſuch coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Drugs, as <hi>Bezoar,</hi> and whether the good Effects and Virtues thereof are anſwerable to the Phyſicians Expectation, and that of the Patient; if not, that you wou'd ingeniouſly declare this Stone naturally, as brought from <hi>India,</hi> and unſophiſtieated hath no more Virtue than ſome of our Foreign Earths, or Domeſtick Chalks.</p>
            <p>IT is pretended by the Advocates for this Stone, that it is a moſt noble <hi>Alexipharmick,</hi> and is both <hi>Cordial</hi> and <hi>Sudorifick,</hi> tho' it does not appear from the Compoſition of its Parts, being Groſs and Earthy, how it can encreaſe or otherwiſe alter the Motion of the Blood, or exhilerate the Spirits, which it ſeems not to have power to fortifie, and ſupport. If this be ſo then, let us ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the force of Truth, which we find publiſh'd in the Writings of ſome of the beſt Phyſicians of <hi>Europe,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> hath accurately quoted; let us ſubmit Opinion, I ſay to Truth, which is one and

               <hi>MARTIANUS</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Phyſician in his Commentaries upon <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Bezoar Stone</hi> is nothing elſe, but a

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0198001400:17"/>that have been told either by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> or the Moderns; for I have try'd it ſeveral Times in ſeveral Diſeaſes, without finding any Relief or Advantage from it. <hi>Aloiſius Mundella,</hi> in his Experiments on <hi>ſimple Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> confirms what all the reſt have ſaid, whom I have quoted before.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me, moſt excellent and learned Collegues, to ſay a Word or two about the Drug <hi>Sena,</hi> which enters ſo many of your well choſen Compoſitions, and which I have the Vanity to think you have not all met with in the common Treatiſes of <hi>ſimple Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> tho' the Subject fell in my way, when I conſulted all the Authors I could then come at in compiling my <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Drugs,</hi> from <hi>Pomet, Lemery Tournefort,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Sena,</hi> which <hi>Meſue</hi> from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> calls <hi>Abal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zemer,</hi> is a Plant or Shrub, the Leaves whereof Reſemble thoſe of Liquorice, it ſhoots up and ſpreads with many ſmall Branches, which are very pliant, the Flowers are yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, with certain Threads or red Streaks underneath, after which ſhoot forth certain Follicula or Buds cloſely folded, which hang upon the Plant, by a ſlender Tail, which is very fine, and naturally flat; theſe Buds when Ripe eaſily fall by the force of the Wind, and contain in them a Seed which is of a greeniſh black Colour, and ſo like the Stone of a Raiſin, that it is hard to know the difference; <hi>Serapion</hi> in his Book of <hi>Simples</hi> ſays, theſe Buds are longiſh, and in form of a Croſs, in which the Seed is lodg'd.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0198001400:18"/>They are much Deceived, who think that the Tree which <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> calls <hi>Colutea</hi> to be our <hi>Sena;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Colutea</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Baguenaudier</hi> bears large <hi>Follicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> or <hi>Buds,</hi> which the Shepherds and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants gather to feed their Cattle with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is a vaſt difference, in that the <hi>Sena</hi> is an Herb or Plant that laſts but a few Months, and the <hi>Bagnenaudier</hi> is a Tree that continues many Years; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the ſame Virtues have been aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the laſt, as to that of <hi>Sena,</hi> and the Merchant impos'd upon as well as the Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt in buying the one for the other. <hi>Meſue</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Sena</hi> hath much more Virtue and Efficacy in the Bud than the Leaf, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if of the Dark green Colour a little bitteriſh, ſtiptick and aſtringent in Taſt, and gather'd when freſh, for otherwiſe the Virtue is loſt. The white Buds are good for nothing, the green Leaves, better than the white, and the thick ones than the thin, but the Stalks of no Uſe at all; and this agrees very well with what <hi>Matthiolus</hi> writes in his learned Commentaries on <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> he ſays indeed, there are two Sorts of theſe Buds, the one of which is gather'd when dry and fallen from the Plant, which have no Virtue in them, and the other is gathered upon the Plant before it is dry and wither'd, and theſe are thick Leaves, and full of Sap, being afterwards skillfully dry'd in the Shade.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Manardus,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Ferrara</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that the Leaves of the <hi>Sena</hi> have a greater Purgative Quality than the Buds, but then he takes 'em for ſuch as dropt from the Tree ready dry'd; but <hi>Fernelius</hi> who was undoubtedly a more knowing Judge of Medicine, follows <hi>Meſue</hi> and <hi>Matthiolus</hi> in preferring the <hi>Buds</hi> to the <hi>Leaves,</hi> and <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> ſubſcribes to the ſame Opinion, in his Commentaries upon <hi>Meſue,</hi> Whoever hath a Mind to Uſe the Buds, muſt obſerve this Deſcription, but ſuch as like the Leaves better, muſt chuſe thoſe of the brighteſt Colour, large and freſh, and free from all Smell, rejecting the pale and dead Colour'd as uſeleſs. Our Druggiſts are often very negligent in mixing all together, without Choice or Diſtinction. With ſubmiſſion to the more learned, I think we generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Doſe this Medicine in our Compoſitions, and Preſeriptions. <hi>Serapion</hi> orders from a Dram, to two Drams in Powder, and half an Ounce to five Drams in Decoction, <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius</hi> only one Dram, and in Decoction half an Ounce; <hi>Fernelius</hi> directs two Drams in Powder, and ſix in Decoction, but half an Ounce in the Infuſion. Your <hi>London Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſatory</hi> preſcribes only a Scruple of <hi>Sena</hi> in Powder, and half a Scruple of <hi>Rhubarb</hi> and <hi>Polypody</hi> in ſeven Drams of <hi>Electuarium Catholicum,</hi> and two Drams only in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of <hi>Gereon,</hi> and in the <hi>Lenitive E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary,</hi> to one Ounce a Dram of <hi>Sena,</hi> with a Scruple of that and <hi>Polypody</hi> in Decoction, in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0198001400:20"/>the larger compound Powder of <hi>Sena,</hi> half a Dram, and in the leſs 24 Grains. The Magiſterial Syrup of Apples hath a Dram of <hi>Sena</hi> to an Ounce, but the Purging Syrup only a Scruple infus'd to ſix Drams. Syrup of Roſes with <hi>Sena</hi> hath indeed a Dram to ſix Drams of the Syrup. I ſhall conclude this Head, with the form of a Purging Potion of <hi>Sena,</hi> from an eminent Phyſician of our own, who Practiced upwards of ſixty Years.</p>
            <p>TAKE of fine <hi>Sena,</hi> cut ſmall ſix Drams, <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> two Drams, Juice of <hi>Lemons</hi> one Ounce, white Wine four Ounces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſix or ſeven Hours, in a Glaſs Veſſel, then ſtrain, and infuſe therein all Night <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary</hi> of <hi>Carthamum</hi> three Drams, the Juice of Apples one Ounce: In the Morning cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie this with the white of an Egg, and to the ſtrain'd Liquor, add Syrup of <hi>Roſes,</hi> with <hi>Agarick</hi> ſix Drams, <hi>Cinamon-Water</hi> two Drams, the zeſt of half an Orange Peel. Notwithſtanding the large Quantity of <hi>Sena;</hi> this is a Medicine of a nice and delicate O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, without giving Gripes or Colick, and yet moves Ten or Twelve times.</p>
