            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT having been inſinuated, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpool Prize was written in the ſpirit of party, the author takes this opportunity of publicly declaring, that nothing could be further from his intention than ſuch an idea. If the maritime phraſes ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated on a late public occaſion, be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſatire in diſguiſe, he confeſſes himſelf too dull to find it out; it was impoſſible to avoid uſing them, in painting a ſailor like Teneriffe: but admitting they were ſelected in conſequence of their being temporary, the writer of the Liverpool Prize has done no more in uſing them, than the beſt dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic writers have done before him, and, indeed, ought to continue to do, if the ſtage be the mirror of the times. Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed

as Shakeſpeare was, and above the neceſſity of ſtooping to temporary alluſions, yet would he ſometimes ſacrifice to them, in order to gratify the public; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which has contributed not a little to that obſcurity in his writings which has ſo long amuſed and perplexed the critics. As to the liberty the author took in mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Admiral Keppel's name, he hopes no man is ſo great an enemy to his country as to aſcribe it to party; it was the tribute of his heart; an echo to the voice of a whole nation, loud in praiſe of a man who had ſo often fought the battles of Old England with ſucceſs, and in whoſe hands the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Britiſh flag can never tarniſh.</p>

               <stage>Looking round with ſurprize.</stage>
               <l>'Sdeath! where am I? What! ſtumbled on the ſtage?</l>
               <l>No wonder that, in this ſatyric age;</l>
               <l>Here markſman Wit ſhoots at all game that flies,</l>
               <l>One night a Nabob—next a Moleſworth dies.</l>
               <l>Why even this I could ſuppoſe Guildhall,</l>

                     <p>The third day we were out, we took a Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux-man, laden with claret, and ſent her into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford in Ireland.</p>

                     <p>Yeſterday morning, we fell in with this here Indiaman, now coming into the harbour, which Captain Wilmot, and every hand aboard, ſays, is worth half a million.</p>

                     <p>It ſhe's worth half that, Breeze, ſhe's a noble prize. Now, my old boy, what do you ſay? Sure you are not diſſatisfied, though you have got but the one Indiaman.</p>

                     <speaker>Breeze.</speaker>
                     <p>But I have a another meſſage for you, Sir. There are ſome great folks taken a-board the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which Captain Wilmot deſires you'll provide lodgings for.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Deben.</speaker>
                     <p>They ſhall lodge at my own houſe till they are better provided for. But tell me their names and quality, that I may know how to conduct myſelf, and make ſuitable preparations.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Breeze.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, in the firſt place, there's a Dutch merchant, who has ſent a power of money over to Europe; he muſt have a good birth, for Captain Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot is very fond of him, I ſuppoſe, becauſe he ſpeaks Engliſh.</p>

                     <speaker>Breeze.</speaker>
                     <p>Then there's a French general and his cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per coloured wife.</p>

                     <p>Oh, zounds! I'll get them private lodgings. Any more?</p>
