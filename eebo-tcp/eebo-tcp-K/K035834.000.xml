            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>There now‚Äîounce and hundred weight! Can't you contrive to think, and talk a little like a Man of Fashion? When you quitted busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, you shou'd have dispos'd of your vulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with your stock in trade. Copy me. Do you find any thing vulgar about me?</p>

                     <p>My good friend, if we are not to attempt cajoling each other, the less you say about your honesty the better.</p>

                     <speaker>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</speaker>
                     <p>Nothing, I am too well bred: beside, I was your partner in trade for twenty-five years.‚ÄîI reap'd half the profits of your ingenuity, and had you been honester, I might be poorer. But, my dear friend, let us settle our business a little quietly, if you will be so kind. Your son, you say, is come to town:‚Äîgood. You insist he may be introduc'd to our ward, Miss Hartley:‚Äîhe shall.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>SIR SIMON FLOURISH.</speaker>
                     <p>I thought you'd say so; because 'tis very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to my own son, who being absent from England, ought not to have a rival introduc'd to the Lady I wish to be his wife. But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as she cannot marry without our joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, we must agree, that which ever she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers shall have our mutual approbation.</p>

                     <p>Leave your growling, good Mr. Bear, and look after your own unlick'd cub. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try breeding will render him vastly pleasing to a young lady!</p>

No, no‚Äîplague take it, that won't do; for if you kill him, they will keep

us there. I should like to see you fight amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but then to pay three hundred pounds for it, it is very dear: I only paid a guinea to see Johnson and Big Ben, and their way of fighting is quite as fashionable now-a days!</p>

                     <p>Now really, Lady Flourish, you are too fond before company, indeed you are. 'Tis your only fault, my dear.

                     <p>Old Testy's stupid bumpkin of a son is to be introduced to you this morning: but there is no fear of his rivalling my boy Jack. How I long to see the rogue again! Where is he now, I wonder? May be, eating macaroni with the Grand Duke, or having the honour of kissing the toe of his Holinesss the Pope. Oh! what high fellows my son is living with!</p>

                     <p>I must not blab, I find. She'd lay an inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and destroy my renown. Were I a Principal instead of a Second, I shou'd be vastly oblig'd to her. <stage>(Aside.)</stage> I wonder how many Duels Jack has fought abroad‚Äîthat is, fought, or been Second in? 'Tis just the same thing. The credit is the same, and so is the danger pretty nearly; for the Principals are often so cursedly frighten'd, that it is an even chance whether they hit their antagonist, or their own Second.</p>

                     <p>No, not I; but I don't live at father's; I've got a place of my own, do as I like, live in the Temple. I am to be a Counsellor, father says, and a plaguy good one I shall make; for it is all done by eating, and I have a fine appetite, if the London air don't spoil it.

                     <p>She wou'd not go. Poll said she wou'd do any thing but cross the water with me. And I could not find in my heart to go abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her. So I touch'd father's cash, and resolv'd to finish my education in my own country.</p>

                     <speaker>YOUNG FLOURISH.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, father went to Bath‚ÄîI staid in town‚Äîthe money flew‚ÄîPoll knew how to dash it. When all was gone, it was natural enough to come here, you know.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>HARCOURT.</speaker>
                     <p>But how were you able to leave Poll?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>YOUNG FLOURISH.</speaker>
                     <p>She did not trouble me to think about that: when the money was gone, Poll left me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>HARCOURT.</speaker>
                     <p>So Poll wou'd not follow your fortunes to the King's Bench!‚ÄîHow unkind!</p>

                     <speaker>YOUNG FLOURISH.</speaker>
                     <p>So I told her‚Äî"Ah, Poll!" said I, "'tis damn'd ill-natur'd to leave me."</p>

                     <p>And what did she say?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>YOUNG FLOURISH.</speaker>
                     <p>She only laugh'd and said,‚Äî"She told me at first, she'd do any thing but cross the water with me."</p>

                     <p>Every thing now is in a state of forwardness unknown to our ancestors. London may be termed an immense hot house, where every thing is forc'd. You eat your fruit before it is in season. You run through your constitution before it is matured. You spend your estate before you are in possession, and get divorced from your wife before you ought to have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. 'Tis a lively system‚ÄîIs it not?</p>

                     <p>Yes, a little; and when I had lost all my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it was vastly friendly of you to lend me the 200l. but I lost them too.</p>

                     <p>My dear friend, I could as soon give you a million. My father does not allowance me in such a grand stile as that comes to. I must catch him in a devilish good humour, aye, and in a great many of them, before I get 200l. of him.</p>

Of the two, 'tis better to marry than go to jail; but at whose suit I shall be obliged to surrender myself, my Wife's, or my Tradesmen's, depends entirely on whether the Bailiff, or the Parson does his business quickest. <stage>[Exit.</stage>

guilty of a dishonourable action," said I, "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil a word wou'd O'Neil offer in his behalf; but as he has been a dupe to the villainy of others, restore him to your favour, and launch him into the world again, with experience for his Pilot."‚ÄîSo the old gentleman shook hands with me, and swore he was ready to do the same with you as soon as you pleased.</p>

                     <p>Nobleness of soul! for walking a few steps out of my common road, for the pleasure of reconciling a discarded Nephew to a rich old Uncle.
