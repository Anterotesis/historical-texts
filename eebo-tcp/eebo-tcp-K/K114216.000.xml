            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>A SINCERE wiſh to benefit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, by furniſhing its moſt ancient, moſt conſtitutional, and moſt uſeful officer with a compendious ſyſtem or manual of his duty and powers, carefully extracted from, and upon an actual peruſal of the beſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, has produced the following ſheets,—a mere epitome, in fact, of the original com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation. But the utility of the meaſure ſeemed, upon ſecond thoughts, to be more favoured by a pamphlet, affording the fulleſt information in the narroweſt compaſs, than by a volume, which the verboſe prolixity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ſtatutes, vying, as it were, with each other in conveying the ſimpleſt regulation in the moſt embarraſſing manner, and greateſt poſſible number of words, would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a ſize and price little calculated to invite the claſs of readers for whom it was principally intended. The deciſion, therefor, was in favour of the briefeſt ſummary; ſuch a one as men who have little money, leiſure, or capacity (one or other, or, indeed, all of
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0637201200:9"/>which are, unfortunately, too often met with in the compoſition of a modern conſtable) might buy, read, and, if poſſible, underſtand<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſmall tract publiſhed under the direction of "the ſociety (as it is called) for carrying into effect the kings proclamation," ſince the following pages were prepared for the preſs, has not appeared to ſuperſede the preſent attempt. Of former publications on the ſubject it may be ſufficient to obſerve, that all or moſt of them have been looked into.</note>. The language, however, is generally that of the authority quoted; and the books referred to (which it may be occaſionally neceſſary to conſult) are to be found in many bookſellers ſhops, and in the libraries of the four law ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties: few barriſters, at the ſame time, are without all or moſt of them; and ſome juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of peace, it is preſumed, may poſſeſs "The Statutes at Large." It is undoubtedly a ſerious conſideration, that the perſons and property of almoſt all but profeſſional men ſhould be ſubjected to laws which they are totally ignorant of, and do not even know where to find, or how, unleſs by dear-bought and fatal experience, to get acquainted with; and of which the mere ſtudy is ſufficient em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for the beſt part, if not the whole, of a long life. Theſe "Statutes at Large," which, while they preſerve many acts that are
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0637201200:10"/>not, and many more that ought not to be, in force, do not contain above half the number that are actually ſo<note n="*" place="bottom">The private and local acts, every where in force and no where to be met with, are at leaſt as numerous. "How is this?" exclaimed a lawyer one day, "why all theſe proceedings of yours are manifeſtly illegal; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> to the Bill of Rights, to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſubject, to —." "Sir," ſays his client, who was a churchwarden, "we have got an act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament." And thus it is; every little dirty pariſh in the environs of London muſt have a law for itſelf. The churchwardens or overſeers can provide the money, the attorney wants a job, the juſtice looks forward to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and the <hi>gemmen of the weſtry</hi> like authority; an act of parliament is accordingly obtained, and, being an admirable compound of ignorance and knavery, cannot fail of proving exceedingly beneficial to the community. To the ſtatutes which <hi>are not</hi> and <hi>ought not to be in force</hi> may be added thoſe which are altogether doubtful, and, till they come in queſtion, cannot be poſitively ſaid either to be in force or not. The drawer of a modern act of parliament ſeldom troubles himſelf about former laws on the ſame ſubject; he erects the new houſe and leaves the old one ſtanding. It is a well-known obſervation of a grave and learned ſerjeant, that an act of parliament was much wanted to repeal all the laws made for thirty years paſt. This, to be ſure, would be pretty well; but a retroſpect of two or three hundred would be infinitely better. Lord Coke complains bitterly of the injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious penners of acts of parliament in his time, "over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden," as he ſays, " with proviſoes and additions, and many times on a ſudden penned or corrected by men of none or very little judgment in law." Thoſe acts, however, which gave ſuch juſt offence to this truly learned and eminent lawyer, will appear perſpicuous as light, and "brief as womans love," when compared with the endleſs and inextricable parliamentary labyrinths of the preſent century. See alſo 1 Black. Com. 10.</note>, are compriſed in no leſs
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0637201200:11"/>than <hi>ſixteen cloſely printed quarto volumes;</hi> the Common Law is diſperſed through near <hi>two hundred folios,</hi> excluſive of every other ſize, many of which exiſt only in a barbarous gibberiſh peculiar to the profeſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">It was long ſince objected as a fault to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the law, that they wrote their reports and books of the law in a ſtrange and unknown tongue, which none could underſtand but themſelves, to the end that people being kept in ignorance of the law, might the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire their ſkill and knowlege, and eſteem and value it at a higher price. Preface to Sir John Davis's Reports, publiſhed in 1628.</note>: even a very imperfect <hi>abridgement</hi> of it filling no leſs than <hi>twenty-four.</hi> This, however, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which has been ſo frequently and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectually made<note n="†" place="bottom">Biſhop Burnet, near a century ago, pronounced the law "the greateſt grievance of the nation." And the great lord Bacon, who complains that the laws were then "ſubject to great incertainties, and variety of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, delays, and evaſions," delivered a formal propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to king James I. for their amendment; and this at a time when the ſtatutes were in <hi>two</hi> volumes, and, beſide the year books, there were but <hi>four reporters</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</note>, that one muſt have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0637201200:12"/>till the miſchief, every day increaſing, ſhall remedy itſelf; till, in ſhort, "there is A DROP TOO MUCH."</p>
                  <p>Sir William Blackſtone obſerves that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what manner of men are for the moſt part out into the office of conſtable, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps very well that they are generally kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Com. 356.</note>; an obſervation to which it may be readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the compiler of the following Digeſt does not ſubſcribe. In fact, he has ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded it as equally ſarcaſtic, illiberal, and unbecoming; and only to be accounted for by the profeſſional character and habits of the writer; who, doubtleſs, thought that <hi>law,</hi> like <hi>religion,</hi> being a <hi>myſtery,</hi> the <hi>ſcriptures</hi> ſhould in both caſes be locked up in an <hi>unknown lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> or <hi>unintelligible jargon</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">3 Com. 322. and Benthams Fragment of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Preface, p. xxxv.</note>; that the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi> ought to know no more than the <hi>initiated</hi> may think fit to communicate; and that, in ſhort, the moſt ignorant are the moſt trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and conſequently the fitteſt for good Chriſtians and good ſubjects. If the powers which the law has veſted in the conſtable be ſo large, that it is even dangerous he ſhould know them, why were they given him? why
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0637201200:13"/>are they not taken away? why is he to be puniſhed for neglecting duties of which it is beſt he ſhould be ignorant? Would it not be full as well, conſidering what manner of men are for the moſt part put into the office of juſtice of peace, if they too were to be kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers? This, indeed, it may be, is already the caſe; though they do not on that account ſeem the leſs inclined to abuſe them. But wherefor is it that ſuch "manner of men" are put into the Office of Conſtable? Becauſe upward of a hundred acts of parliament, which few ever ſee, and ſtill fewer comprehend<note n="*" place="bottom">The emperor Caligula, it is ſaid, cauſed his laws to be written ſo ſmall, and placed ſo high, that, though all might clearly ſee, none could poſſibly read. The Engliſh law is thought by ſome to bear in many inſtances a great reſemblance to the Roman. And it ſeems a maxim in both, that <hi>ignorantia legis non excuſat.</hi> Others have not heſitated to ſay that Britiſh ſtatutes reſemble cobwebs, placed in darkneſs and obſcurity, for the purpoſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapping the ſmaller flies, in order to glut the <hi>bottled-ſpiders</hi> of Weſtminſter Hall with their blood. But theſe, no doubt, are the ravings of beggered ſuitors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not to be regarded.</note>, added to the arbitrary and capricious deciſions of ſome courts, and the ignorance and innovation of others, have redered it ſo burthenſome, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, vexatious, and expenſive, that they who poſſeſs or uſurp the power of filling it, ſelect
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0637201200:14"/>thoſe who have nothing to recommend them but the willingneſs with which they receive the yoke, and the patience with which they bear it. The reaſon given for this partiality is, that <hi>no</hi> GENTLEMAN can accept <hi>ſuch an office;</hi> poverty, both in purſe and in ſpirit, being looked upon as the proper qualification for a conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Theſe ſame GENTLEMEN, it ſhould ſeem, are <hi>high-mettled horſes,</hi> who would kick and wince, and play the devil, in ſhort, if you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to put them in the ſhafts; the VUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAR are <hi>aſſes,</hi> who tamely ſubmit to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity. But, gentleman or no gentleman, he who can beſt afford to loſe his time and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, who has ſpirit and ability to ſuſtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and reſolution to oppoſe inſult and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, is the fitteſt perſon to diſcharge the Office of Conſtable. To confer it, from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever motive, upon people of baſe or inferior condition, was long ago reprobated by lord Bacon as "a mere abuſe or degenerating from the firſt inſtitution<note n="*" place="bottom">Law Tracts, 183.</note>." And, certainly, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a man who depends upon his daily employment for the daily bread of himſelf and his family, and whoſe time is of courſe the moſt precious, ought to be a ſufficient excuſe in any court of juſtice why he ſhould not be
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0637201200:15"/>compelled to ſerve this office; only it would probably coſt him more to obtain the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination than he can value his time at. It is, doubtleſs, a very ſcandalous inſinuation that juſtices of peace, who have ſome how or other acquired the power of making conſtables, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the meaneſt and moſt ignorant by way of magnifying their own wiſdom and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; gems, it is well known, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no foil to increaſe their luſtre.</p>
                  <p>It is, by no means, a leſs abuſe, when a perſon every way fit for the office is pitched upon, to admit in his ſtead any worthleſs fellow that he can procure, baſe enough to ſerve the duty for a few guineas. What integrity or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of conduct can be expected from one whoſe neceſſity renders every ſhilling that is offered him an irreſiſtible temptation? The great Shakſpeare has ſatiriſed this practice with admirable pleaſantry, in his play of <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for Meaſure,</hi> where he introduces the character of a fooliſh ſubſtitute bringing a charge before one of the dukes deputies:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſcalus.</hi> Come hither to me, maſter Elbow; come hither, maſter conſtable. How long have you been in this place of conſtable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elbow.</hi> Seven years and a half, ſir.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſca.</hi> I thought, by your readineſs in the office, you
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0637201200:16"/>had continued in it ſome time.—Alas! it hath been great pains to you! they do you wrong to put you ſo oft upon it. Are there not men in your ward ſufficient to ſerve it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elbow.</hi> Faith, ſir, few of any wit in ſuch matters: as they are choſen, they are glad to chooſe me for them; I do it for ſome piece of money, and go through with all<note n="*" place="bottom">There is another not over-wiſe conſtable in the Comedy of <hi>Much ado about Nothing;</hi> and again in that of <hi>Loves Labour Loſt.</hi> It is to be hoped ſuch a character is not ſo very common now a days.</note>.</p>
                  <p>If the preſervation of peace and good order be the intereſt of ſociety, the legiſlature would eſſentially contribute to that end in extending more effectual protection and encouragement to the conſtable. This would be done by cauſing all the laws which authoriſe or oblige him to do particular acts, or any way concern the execution of his office, to be reduced into a ſingle ſtatute, conceived in plain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible language<note n="†" place="bottom">A reſolution of all the judges would anſwer the ſame purpoſe. Something of this kind, it is true, was formerly attempted by a chief juſtice, but being haſtily, careleſsly, and every way badly done, was deſervedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by his brethren.</note>; and by requiring every court, at the election of a conſtable, to put a
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0637201200:17"/>copy of it into his hands: in order that, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his power and duty conſtantly under his eye, he might be without excuſe in neglecting the one, and without danger in exerciſing the other. If it be true that every man who ſerves the public ought to be paid by the public, it is moſt unreaſonable and unjuſt that a duty ſhould be impoſed upon any one, which, if attended to as it ought to be, would demand the greateſt part of his time, not only without making him the ſlighteſt recompence, but even obliging him to be at (what is to him) a conſiderable expence; for even the mere "conſumption of time, to him who lives by the ſale of his time, is equivalent to expence." Suppoſe, therefor, that every perſon duly elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſtable were, during his continuance in office, not exceeding one year, exempt from all taxes and impoſitions; parliamentary, or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and, in caſe of actions againſt him touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his office (the dread of which is one great obſtacle to its due execution) ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to defend, not <hi>in forma pauperis,</hi> but ſome really unexpenſive mode<note n="*" place="bottom">The defence of actions by an <hi>innocent man</hi> requires the fortune of a <hi>rich one.</hi> Even a <hi>pauper,</hi> who is to ſwear himſelf not worth <hi>five pounds</hi> in the world, will have to provide <hi>ten,</hi> or poſſibly <hi>fifty</hi> times that ſum, to proſecute or defend his ſuit.</note> This, if not an
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0637201200:18"/>adequate compenſation, would be a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and in ſome caſes, at leaſt, an indemnity, to perſons ſerving the office, would induce them to accept it with cheerfulneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute it with ſpirit, conſcious that in ſo doing they were benefiting ſociety without injuring themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">In ſome parts of the north, the conſtable is intitled to an ancient <hi>ceſs</hi> charged upon certain lands, which has formerly amounted to a pretty conſiderable ſum.</note>. One cannot, however, have the ſatisfaction to think, that a ſuggeſtion ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous both to the community and to the individual, ſtands the leaſt chance of ever paſſing into a law. If, indeed, the propoſal were for a productive tax upon conſtables, or for the purpoſe of making bad worſe, or of heaping oppreſſion upon the oppreſſed, there would be little fear of its being adopted.

<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0637201200:19"/>the better,) the compiler will have reaſon to flatter himſelf that his efforts, though humble, have not been uſeleſs,</p>

                  <p>§ 1. THE origin of the word CONSTABLE, which ſome etymologiſts have errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ſought for in the Saxon language<note n="(1)" place="bottom">See Lambard, Sir T. Smith, and others.</note>, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to be found in the <hi>Comes Stabuli</hi> of the Eaſtern empire: hence the <hi>conſtabularius, conſtabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> &amp;c. of barbarous Latinity; the <hi>conneſtable</hi> of the French; the <hi>coneſtabile</hi> of the Italians, &amp;<note n="(2)" place="bottom">See Spelmans Gloſſary, <hi>voce</hi> CONSTABULARIU<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> This <hi>comes ſtabuli</hi> was at firſt, as his title imports, no more than prefect or ſuperintendant of the imperial ſtables, or, in other words, the emperors maſter of the horſe; but having, in proceſs of time, obtained the command of the army, his name, corrupted into <hi>conſtabulus</hi> and <hi>conſtabularius,</hi> began to ſignify a commander; and, with this ſignification, appears to have been introduced into England at the Norman Conqueſt, or, perhaps, ſooner; ſince, in fact, ſome ſuch officer ſeems to have been already known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of <hi>Stallarius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 2. THE CONSTABLE (or LORD HIGH CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STABLE) OF ENGLAND was an officer of the higheſt dignity and importance in the realm. He was the leader of the kings armies; and had the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of all contracts and other matters touching
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0637201200:21"/>arms or war<note n="(3)" place="bottom">13 R. z. ſt. 1. c. 2. See alſo. Madox's Hiſtory of the Exchequer, p. 27, &amp;c.</note>. This office, which appears to have been granted by William the Conqueror to Walter earl of Glouceſter, or, according to others, to William Fitzoſbern, or Roger de Mortimer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, afterward, hereditary in two different families, as annexed to the earldom of Hereford; and, in that right, after a lapſe of near two centuries, (ſeveral perſons enjoying the title and authority in the mean time) was revived, by judgement of law, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Edward Stafford duke of Buckingham; but Henry VIII. thinking the office too high and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for the hands of a ſubject, took the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of putting an end to it by cutting off his head. Since this period, there has been no lord high conſtable, except <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> as Robert earl of Lindſey was appointed in 1631 to determine the appeal of lord Rea againſt Ramſey, and as ſome perſon or other is created at the coronation of a king or queen.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. We had alſo CONSTABLES OF CASTLES, that is, keepers or governors, ſo called, of the caſtles of the king or great barons, whom the French term <hi>châtellains,</hi> from the Latin <hi>caſtellani,</hi> and who were frequently hereditary, and by feudal tenure; ſuch were the conſtable of the tower, the conſtable of London, or Baynards-caſtle, the conſtables of the caſtles of Dover, Windſor, Cheſter, Flint, &amp;c. ſome of which offices, though not now hereditary, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to this day. Theſe are the conſtables in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> cc. 17. 20. and who, in the ſtatute of Weſtminſter the firſt (3 E. 1. c. 15.)
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0637201200:22"/>are called conſtables of ſees, and there conſidered as keepers of priſons; a conſtituent part, indeed, of all ancient caſtles. Lord Coke obſerves that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Magna Charta</hi> theſe conſtables of caſtles had the like authority within their precincts as the ſheriff had within his bailiwick, and commonly ſealed with their portraiture on horſeback <note n="(4)" place="bottom">2 Inſt. 31. See alſo W. 1. c. 17.</note>. The ſtatute of 5 H. 4. c. 10. which recites that, by colour of their commiſſions as juſtices of the peace, they took peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom they bore evil will, and impriſoned them in their caſtles till they made fine and ranſom for their deliverance, and ordains that none be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned but in the common jail, ſeems to have put an end to a race of tyrants ſo odious to the people as to be uſually repreſented in romances under the character of monſtrous giants, who, not content with the property, would eat the fleſh, drink the blood, and grind the bones of the unwary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate traveler.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. There was likewiſe formerly a CONSTABLE OF THE EXCHEQUER; of whom we may read in the <hi>Dialogus Scaccarii,</hi> l. 1. c. 5. in the ſtatute <hi>De Diſtrictione Scaccarii</hi> (51 H. 3. ſt. 5.) in Fleta, l. 2. c. 31. and in Madox's Hiſtory of that Court, p. 724, &amp;c. We alſo find mention made in ſome old ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of THE CONSTABLE OF THE STAPLE. See 27 E. 3. c. 8. 15 R. 2. c. 9. 23 H. 8. c. 6.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. We now come to THE CONSTABLE OF THE HUNDRED, OR HIGH, CHIEF, OR HEAD CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STABLE (as he is otherwiſe called) of whom we ſhall have a little more to ſay. By the ſtatute of
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0637201200:23"/>Wynton, or Wincheſter (13 E. 1.) c. 6. it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that in every hundred or franchiſe there ſhall be choſen two conſtables to make the view of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as directed in the preceding part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that the conſtables aforeſaid ſhall preſent before the juſtices aſſigned the defaults of armour and of the ſuits of towns and of highways; and ſhall alſo preſent thoſe who harbour ſtrangers in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land towns for whom they will not anſwer. They are likewiſe to preſent ſheriffs or bailiffs who do not follow the cry of the county.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed by Mr. Lamberd<note n="(5)" place="bottom">On Conſtables, 3.</note>, by ſir Edward Coke<note n="(6)" place="bottom">4 Inſt. 267.</note>, and by ſir Matthew Hale<note n="(7)" place="bottom">2 P. C. 96.</note>, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables of the hundred were firſt introduced by this ſtatute. And though Fitzherbert<note n="(8)" place="bottom">J. P. 156, b.</note>, and Crompton after him<note n="(9)" place="bottom">J. P. 201, b.</note>, have aſſerted that they were conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators of the peace at the Common Law; and though it is ſaid in other books that "notwithſtanding the opinions to the contrary," the high conſtable was an officer at the Common Law, and that the ſtatute of Wynton only enlarged his authority<note n="(10)" place="bottom">3 Keble, 231. Salk. 175. 381. 11 Mod. 215. L. Rav. 1193. 1195.</note>, yet no one has hitherto produced the leaſt evidence in ſupport of ſuch aſſertion. On the other hand, beſide the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Coke and Hale, it has been expreſsly held from the Bench, that a high conſtable is not ſuch an officer, nor conſervator of the peace, whereof the
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0637201200:24"/>Common Law takes any notice; that he is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in any book; and that, in fine, he is only by cuſtom and for conformity<note n="(11)" place="bottom">Cro. Eliz. 375. where it is ſaid that in the North they had no high conſtables, which appears from Nordens <hi>Deſcription,</hi> p. 30. to be the caſe in Cornwall.</note>. It muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the firſt mention made of the high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable in any ſtatute ſubſequent to that already cited, is by 4 E. 4. c. 1.<note n="(12)" place="bottom">He afterwards occurs in 19 H. 7. c. 11. 22 H. 8. c. 23. 24 H. 8. c. 10, &amp;c.</note> And though ſir William Blackſtone has, in one place, attempted to carry up his antiquity as high as king Henry II.<note n="(13)" place="bottom">4 Com. 211. The <hi>praepoſitus hundredi,</hi> whom the learned author has miſtaken for the high conſtable, ſeems to have been the bailiff of the hundred, as <hi>praepoſitus comitatus</hi> is the ſheriff, and <hi>praepoſitus manerii</hi> the bailiff or reve of the manor. <hi>Vide</hi> Spelman, <hi>in voce.</hi> The <hi>praepoſitus hundredi</hi> is frequently mentioned in Domeſday Book.</note> he, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, expreſsly mentions him to have been firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the ſtatute of Wincheſter<note n="(14)" place="bottom">1 Com. 355.</note>. After all, however, nothing can be more certain than that the conſtable of the hundred, or high conſtable, whether he be allowed an officer at the Common Law or not, was inſtituted long before that ſtatute. This curious fact is aſcertained by a writ or mandate of the 36th year of king Henry III. preſerved in the <hi>Adverſaria</hi> to Wats's edition of Matthew Paris, and from which chapters 4. and 6. of the ſtatute of Wynton are evidently taken, though it has hitherto eſcaped the notice of every writer or ſpeaker upon the ſubject. By this writ it is provided, that in every hundred there ſhould be conſtituted a CHIEF
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0637201200:25"/>CONSTABLE, at whoſe mandate all thoſe of his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſworn to arms [<hi>i. e.</hi> to have ſuch arms, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quantity of their lands or chattels, as there directed] ſhould aſſemble and be obſervant to him for the doing of thoſe things which belong to the conſervation of the kings peace<note n="(15)" place="bottom">In ſingulis vero hundredis conſtituatur <hi>UNUS CAPITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIS CONSTABULARIUS,</hi> ad cujus mandatum omnet jurati ad arma de hundredis ſuis conveniant, &amp; cis ſint intendentes ad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum ea quae ſpectant ad conſervationem pacis noſtrae.</note>. No men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is believed, of this officer can be any where found prior to the date of this inſtrument; which, however, it may be contended, no more determines the queſtion as to his original creation, than the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Wynton appeared to do; the language in both caſes being imperative, and the only difference conſiſting in the word <hi>eleus</hi> (choſen) for <hi>conſtituatur</hi> (conſtituted). Be this as it will, the diſcovery ought at leaſt to teach not antiquaries alone, but even lawyers and judges to look a little into matter of record, and truſt leſs to opinion, which ought no more to be law upon the Bench than it is off it.</p>
                  <p>§ 6. The CONSTABLE OF THE VILL (or PETTY CONSTABLE, as, to diſtinguiſh him from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of the hundred, he is frequently called) has been repeatedly acknowleged by the law to be "one of the moſt ancient officers in the realm for the conſervation of the peace<note n="(16)" place="bottom">Popham, 13. and below, p. 1.</note>," and is declared by lord Coke to be as ancient as torns or leets be, and not to have begun about the beginning of E. 3. as ſome have ſuppoſed<note n="(17)" place="bottom">4 Inſt. 265. His lordſhip here alludes to the opinion of Mr. Lambard, who ſays, "About the beginning of the reign of K. Ed. 3. petty conſtables were deviſed in towns and pariſhes for the aid of the conſtables of the hundred." An opinion which certainly detracts from the character of Mr. Lambard as an induſtrious or judicious antiquary. Lord Bacon, on the contrary, who allows the great antiquity of (petty) conſtables, doubts that the high conſtable was not <hi>ab origine,</hi> and only introduced for conveniency ſake "when the authority of the juſtices of the peace [who did not exiſt before the firſt year of Edw. 3.] was enlarged by divers ſtatutes." Law Tracts, 181. An idea equally erroneous.</note>. It muſt be confeſſed,
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0637201200:26"/>however, that no mention of him, by this identical name, is any where found to occur anterior to the writ or mandate, already mentioned, of king Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry III. whereby it is provided, that in every villate or townſhip there ſhould be conſtituted a conſtable or two, according to the number of the inhabitants<note n="(18)" place="bottom">In ſingulis verò villatis aliis conſtituatur <hi>UNUS CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STABULARIUS</hi> vel duo, ſecundùm numerum inhabitantium &amp; proviſionem praedictorum.</note>. It is, nevertheleſs, pretty certain, that lord Cokes idea is right, and that this officer is actually owing to the inſtitution of the frankpledge, uſually attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to king Alfred, and was in fact originally the ſenior or chief pledge of the tithing or <hi>decenna.</hi> In ſupport of this poſition we may obſerve, that the conſtable (or an officer reſembling him) is, in many places, at this very day, called the <hi>headborough, tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingman,</hi> or <hi>borſholder;</hi> all names belonging to the chief pledge, and to be found in numerous ſtatutes in company with and as ſynonimous to <hi>conſtable</hi>
                     <note n="(19)" place="bottom">See 28 H. c. 10. now repealed, in which we have likewiſe a <hi>thirdborough.</hi> See alſo Sir T. Smith, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of England, 174, and Lambard on Conſtables <hi>paſſim.</hi>
                     </note>;
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0637201200:27"/>that the ſtatute of 2 E. 3. c. 3. in which the name of <hi>this</hi> conſtable firſt occurs, the words are "BURGH-ALDRES, CONESTABLES, <hi>et gardeins de la pees;</hi>" and, laſtly, that in the ſtat. of 20 H. 6. c. 14. the "CONSTABLES, TITHINGMEN, and CHIEF PLEDGES of every town, are required to aid the venders of goods in diſputes with the kings purveyors." It was therefor rightly adjudged in <hi>B. R.</hi> 23 <hi>C.</hi> 2. that "<hi>decennarius, prima facie,</hi> is the ſame with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and differed little in the execution of that office;" though Hale (who has elſewhere told us all he knew about the matter) ſaid he was not the ſame officer<note n="(20)" place="bottom">1 Ven. 170. It ſhould ſeem, indeed, from Lambard and others, that where there is a conſtable as well as a tyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingman, headborough, or thirdborough in one and the ſame place, the office of the latter is inferior to that of conſtable. In Shakſpeares comedy of <hi>Much ado about Nothing,</hi> two of the characters are a "conſtable" and a "headborough;" but, though it is ſufficiently evident that Maſter Dogherry, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, takes a great deal more upon him than his "comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner." yet as he ſuppoſes himſelf by much the wiſer man, it is not perfectly clear that he was inveſted with any greater degree of authority. It is allowed, however, that where there is only a headborough, thirdborough or tythingman, his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice does not at all differ from that of conſtable. One is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, at a loſs to conceive why the court (Gould J.) ſhould, on the trial of Power for murder (O. B. Sep. 1789), aſk one of the witneſſes, "What are you, a <hi>conſtable</hi> or a <hi>headborough? —A.</hi> I am <hi>headborough</hi> of Aldgate." "Was there <hi>any conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in the paſſage at that time?—<hi>A.</hi> There was not." Since, the arreſt being illegal for want of a <hi>warrant,</hi> it could make no difference what he was, nor whether any conſtable (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Aldgate had <hi>both</hi> conſtable and headborough) were preſent or not. Sly, the drunken tinker, in the <hi>Taming of the Shrow,</hi> is threatened by his hoſteſs with the <hi>"third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough;"</hi> and, the term not being familiar to the London edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, got corrupted into <hi>headborough,</hi> which is evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous and abſurd; "<hi>Third, or fourth,</hi> or <hi>fifth</hi> borough," ſays he, "I'll anſwer him by law." In <hi>Loves Labour Loſt,</hi> Goodman Dall ſays, he reprehends the duke own perſon, and calls himſelf "his grace's <hi>tharborough.</hi>"
Norden, in his <hi>Deſcription of Cornwell,</hi> p. 30, tells us, that "tythinges have <hi>therdbarows,</hi> in ſome places <hi>hedborows,</hi> in ſome <hi>borrowſheds,</hi> and in the weſte partes a tything man." And Ben Jonſon, in his <hi>Tale of a Tub,</hi> introduces the "high conſtable of Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh-town," the "headborough" of Iſlington, the "petty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable" of Hamſtead, the "thirdborough" of Belſiſe, and "the high conſtables man."

<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0637201200:31"/>mentioned, for the firſt time, and in thoſe of 4.

                  </q>
                  <p>This paſſage is the rather curious, as we do not elſewhere find that the conſtable had any power to put people in irons, much leſs to detain them for ſo conſiderable a length of time. Poſſibly, however, it is to be underſtood of the conſtable or keeper of a caſtle, before mentioned; although in muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the expreſſion would in this caſe have been more accurately THE <hi>conſtable,</hi> ſince there could not well be more than <hi>one</hi> ſuch officer attending the court.</p>
                  <p>§ 7. Notwithſtanding any thing that has been ſaid or omitted in the courſe of this enquiry, it ſeems highly probable that, at the Common Law, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mandate of Henry III. the conſtable of the hundred, and the conſtable of the manor, were offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the ſame nature and authority, originating at the ſame time, and differing only as to the extent of their ſeveral diſtricts: In ſhort, that they bore to each other the ſame analogy as ſubſiſted between the
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0637201200:32"/>bailiff of the hundred and the bailiff of the manor; and, conſequently, that the local juriſdiction of the conſtable of the hundred was commenſurate with that of the torn or leet at which he was elected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch part of the diviſion only as was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the juriſdiction of any other leet. It follows, therefor, that the conſtable of the hundred neither poſſeſſed nor could have exerciſed any more authority within the precinct of the leet, than the conſtable of one manor poſſeſſed or could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in another; the manor being, to all intents and purpoſes, exempt from and excluded out of the hundred<note n="(30)" place="bottom">See 4 Inſt. 261. It ſhould hence ſeem that at this day a warrant directed to all conſtables generally, cannot be legally executed by the high conſtable within the limits of any petty conſtablery.</note>. The preeminence, therefor, which the conſtable of the hundred is ſuppoſed to have, or may think proper to aſſume, over the conſtables of manors or townſhips within the hundred, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfounded and imaginary, and might, with equal juſtice or propriety, be claimed by the bailiff of the hundred or ſheriff of the county over the bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff of the manor, or, in ſhort, by any one conſtable over another whoſe diſtrict was more circumſcribed; for though, as lord Bacon obſerves, the high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables authority hath the more ample circuit, "yet I do not find," ſays he, "that the petty conſtable is ſubordinate to the high conſtable, or to be ordered or commanded by him<note n="(31)" place="bottom">Law Tracts, 181.187.</note>." Thoſe caſes, therefor, wherein it has been adjudged, that the being ſubject to a particular leet ſhall not excuſe a man from ſerving the office of conſtable of the hundred, ſeem
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:0637201200:33"/>to have been decided upon a wrong principle, and (to uſe an expreſſion of ſir Edward Coke) "for want of the knowlege of antiquity<note n="(32)" place="bottom">3 Keble, 197.230, 231. Freeman, 348.11 Mod. 215.</note>."</p>
                  <p>All this, however, is ſpoken with an exception not of acts of parliament only, which, tinker-like, for one flaw they pretend to remedy, make a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note n="(33)" place="bottom">To offer advice to the legiſlature may be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous but is certainly a uſeleſs meaſure. It would, however, leſſen the miſchief which almoſt every act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament unintentionally does, if a general ſaving or proviſo were introduced, as is uſual in private acts, whereby every right, law, or cuſtom, not expreſsly taken away or altered by ſuch act, ſhould continue in force.</note>, but alſo of the powers and pretenſions, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed or aſſerted by the quarter ſeſſions, which being generally compoſed of men who neither know nor care what the law is, and who, therefor, conſider themſelves as a ſort of legiſlative body, and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do whatever they pleaſe,—finding it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, much eaſier to make new laws than to become acquainted with thoſe already made,—has, in direct oppoſition to a poſitive rule of law<note n="(34)" place="bottom">That a court created by act of parliament cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, nor exerciſe any authority which is not thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly given to them. "How," ſays Holt, "can juſtices of peace make a conſtable, who is an officer at Common Law, and they only by ſtatute?" 12 Mod. 180. See alſo 4 Inſt. 267.</note>, uſurped ſo much, and ſo long, with reſpect to the election and controul both of the conſtable of the hundred and of the conſtable of the vill, that it is become difficult, if not impoſſible, to determine, with any degree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the actual rights of either.</p>

The grand inqueſt for the county of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, previous to their ſitting, and before they are ſworn, iſſue a warrant, under their hands and ſeals, to the high conſtable, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to ſummon the petty conſtables, who, on making default are preſented by the inqueſt and compelled to <hi>appear</hi> to the preſentment in the crown office and take a copy of it, which is attended with an expence of between 20 and 30 ſhillings, and <hi>here</hi> the proceedings uniformly ſtop. And, this is done every term, but ſurely without the privity of the Court of Kings Bench, which can never ſanction ſo illegal and oppreſſive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. No grand jury has the leaſt power by law to require the attendance of a ſingle perſon for any purpoſe whatever, even after it is ſworn, and yet here is one which aſſumes that power even before it exiſts. The warrant is ſent to the high conſtable, who is no officer of the Court of the Kings Bench, and has no buſineſs to obey it. And yet if any one thus irregularly called upon does not appear he will be ſubject to the above <hi>fine</hi> in the crown-office. For though the court would doubtleſs quaſh the preſentment, yet the getting it quaſhed would coſt him a great deal more: he is therefor obliged to ſubmit to an unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and oppreſſive meaſure, becauſe the remedy is worſe than the diſeaſe.

The conſtable of St. Margarets pariſh in Weſtminſter, having a ſearch warrant directed to the conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of that pariſh, came into the pariſh of St. Paul, Covent-Garden, and took a woman in the ſtreet near the theatre, and carried her to the round-houſe; where he was aſſaulted and killed by ſome who wanted to reſcue her; and this killing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged only manſlaughter: 1. Becauſe it was a ſudden action without precedent malice. 2. Becauſe the conſtable had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at all in Covent-Garden; nor, ſuppoſing he had any, was the woman guilty of any diſorderly act; and it is not a conſtables ſuſpecting that will juſtify his taking up any perſon, but it muſt be juſt grounds of ſuſpicion; and it would be hard that the liberty of the ſubject ſhould depend on the will of the conſtable, or his not liking a womans looks be any cauſe of ſuſpicion. 3. The priſoners had a ſufficient provocation; for it one be impriſoned upon an unlawful authority, it is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient provocation to all people out of compaſſion, much more when it is done under a colour of juſtice; and WHERE THE LIBERTY OF THE SUBJECT IS INVADED, IT IS A PROVOCATION TO ALL THE SUBJECTS IN ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND.

                           <p>There are other inſtances of a conſtable, or his aſſiſtant, being killed, where he has been too officiously or imprudently, becauſe ignorantly acting as ſuch, and exerciſing an authority not given him by law; which of courſe will in ſuch caſe afford him no more protection than a common man. See the trial of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Power for the wilful murder of John Wilkinſon, Seſſions paper, 1788-9. p. 820, where Gould, J. having conſulted two of his brethren, in directing the jury, ſaid, <q>the thing being over, it was unwarrantable in theſe people to ſeize this man thus quiet, without having an authority from a juſtice of peace; he was therefore illegally aſſaulted and arreſted by theſe men: when a man therefore is deprived of his liberty, and does an act that cauſes the death of the aſſailant in any manner whatever, certainly by law it reduces the offence to manſlaughter:</q> and ſo of courſe the jury found. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed had ſent for the conſtable, and given him charge of the priſoner, for having drawn a knife on him twice, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life, and in helping the conſtable to force him away, was unfortunately ſtabbed. See alſo Leaches Caſes in Crown Law, 211. Theſe little accidents ſhould operate to make every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable more familiar with his actual powers, which, wherever there may be danger, he ought always, for his greater ſecurity, to execute with ſufficient aſſiſtance or properly armed; ſince the hanging of his <hi>murderer</hi> (though it be all the law can do) will hardly reſtore him to life, or recompence his family for his loſs; let him therefor learn to protect himſelf; and let others, alſo, when he is uſurping an illegal authority, be taught to protect themſelves againſt him.</p>

                           <p>Note, The above act extends only to actions of tort: and therefor where an action for money had and received was brought againſt an officer who had levyed money on a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a juſtice of the peace, the conviction having been quaſhed, it was holden, that a demand of a copy of the warrant was not neceſſary. Bullers N. P. 24. And although this act may afford the conſtable protection in a civil ſuit, yet if the warrant be plainly illegal, as, for inſtance, to apprehend a man for <hi>adultery</hi> or <hi>inceſt,</hi> it ſeems the party may legally reſiſt, and if in defence of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty he kill the conſtable, ſuch killing is not murder; but if on the other hand the conſtable ſhould kill him, he ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged guilty of murder.</p>
                           <p>☞ Of the above deſcription, perhaps, are the warrants put into the hands of an uninformed conſtable, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes every thing to be legal which comes from a juſtice of peace, who may poſſibly at the ſame time be as ignorant as himſelf, for the ſearching after and IMPRESSING OF SEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN; a practice in direct violation of every conſtitutional princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and certainly unſupported by any poſitive law. Let the conſtable therefor who too officiously engages in a buſineſs ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly unpopular, ſeriously reflect of the riſk he runs; let him dread the conſequences of a ſpirited reſiſtance. He murders if he kill; it is juſtifiable homicide, or at moſt manſlaughter, if he be killed. The law, very properly, encourages and invites all men to repreſs an act of illegality and violence, and the rather, as we have juſt ſeen, if it be done under colour of juſtice. See the caſe already cited in Lord Raymonds Reports; and that of Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins Hugget, in Sir John Kelyngs: Caſes of much greater conſequence and authority than the flimſy reaſoning uſed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of preſs-warrants.

                  <p>TO the conciſe view attempted in the following pages of the juriſdiction of the Court Leet it may not be improper to prefix a few words upon the name, antiquity, nature, and preſent ſtate of this ancient and venerable tribunal.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The name or ſtile of this court,<note place="margin">NAME.</note> as formally entered in its own proceedings, is the "Court Leet and View of Frankpledge." The word <hi>Leet,</hi>—which, it is very remarkable, is to be found neither in the Saxon law, nor in Glanvil, Bracton, Britton, Fleta, or the Mirror, our moſt ancient law writers, nor in any ſtatute prior to the 27th year of King Ed. III.<note n="(1)" place="bottom">C. 28. After which it does not appear again till the 4 E. 4. c. 1. See alſo 12 E. 4. c. 9.</note> though it is allowed to occur in the Conquerors charter for the foundation of Battle Abbey, and not unfrequently in Domeſday book<note n="(2)" place="bottom">Spelmans Gloſſary, <hi>v. Leta.</hi>
                     </note>,—ſeems to be derived from the Saxon leoð <hi>plebs;</hi> and to mean the <hi>populi curia,</hi> or folk mote, as the Sheriffs tourn or Leet of the county (at leaſt) appears to have been once actually called<note n="(3)" place="bottom">Spelman, <hi>v.</hi> Folkeſmote. Kennets Parochial Antiquities, Gloſ. <hi>v.</hi> Falmote.</note>; in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction, perhaps, to the Halmote or Court Baron,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0637201200:90"/>which conſiſted of the free tenants only, who, being few in number, might conveniently aſſemble in the Lords Hall; whereas the Leet, which required the attendance of all the refiants, and concerned the adminiſtration of public juſtice, was, as there will be hereafter occaſion to mention, uſually held in the open air. The "view of Frankpledge," <hi>viſus franciplegii,</hi> means the examination or ſurvey of the freepledges, of which every man, not particularly privileged, was anciently obliged to have nine, who were bound that he ſhould be always forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming to anſwer any complaint. The better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this we are to be informed that the kingdom being divided into countys or ſhires, and each county into hundreds, and each hundred into tithings, each tithing containing ten families or houſeholds, the heads of theſe families were reciprocally bound and reſponſible for each other; ſo that, in fact, of every ten houſeholders through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdom each man had nine pledges or ſureties for his good behaviour<note n="(4)" place="bottom">Of theſe pledges the eldeſt, or moſt reſpectable, and firſt ſworn, was called the headborough or chief pledge, and had a degree of authority over the reſt, not now exactly aſcertained. It was, however, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, much the ſame with that of the conſtable, who was formerly a character of great conſequence, and is to this day in many places called the <hi>headborough,</hi> a word, which, according to Sir William Blackſtone, (too implicitly following Sir Thomas Smith) beſpeaks its own etymology, and means "the diſcreeteſt perſon in the <hi>borough.</hi>" Great lawyers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are ſometimes indifferent etymologiſts: the word, in fact, implys nothing more or leſs than the chief pledge, from borg, borh, or borhoe, <hi>fidejuſſor,</hi> a pledge or ſurety. He was alſo called the <hi>borſalder</hi> (borges <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>alder) (<hi>i. e.</hi> the eldeſt of the pledges, and the <hi>tithing man.</hi>) Both <hi>tithing man</hi> and <hi>borſholder</hi> are to be found in modern ſtatutes as ſynonimous with <hi>conſtable</hi> and <hi>headborough.</hi> But at what period the conſtable became a diſtinct officer, and the chief pledges were metamorphoſed into a grand jury, is a point which muſt be left to a more ſucceſsful enquirer.</note>. This is the famous ſyſtem of King Alfred, ſo much applauded by both ancient and
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0637201200:91"/>modern writers; which produced ſuch ſingular effects among a barbarous and diſorderly people, that a man might have hung his purſe by the ſide of a public road, and found it untouched a month after; or might have ridden, with much treaſure, and no other weapon than a white wand, from one end of the kingdom to the other<note n="(5)" place="bottom">Ingulphus.

Since, however, this ſo excellent and admirable inſtitution is, from whatever cauſe, ſunk into total diſuſe, there not having been any freepledges in the kingdom for two or three centuries, the words "View of Frankpledge" in the ſtile of the court ſeem now altogether unneceſſary and improper.

That the Leet is "the moſt ancient court in the land" (for criminal matters, that is, the Court Baron being of no leſs antiquity in civil) has been pronounced by the higheſt legal authority<note n="(7)" place="bottom">7 H, 6. 12, b. 1 Roll.

For though we do not meet with the <hi>word</hi> among the Saxons, there can be no doubt of the exiſtence of the <hi>thing.</hi> The venerable chief juſtice who lately retired from the elevated ſituation
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0637201200:92"/>in which he had ſo long preſided found this court "coeval with the eſtabliſhment of the Saxons here," and its activity "marked very viſibly both amongſt the Saxons and the Danes<note n="(8)" place="bottom">3 Bur. 1860.</note>." In thoſe times whoever poſſeſſed a vill or territory, with the liberties of <hi>ſoc, ſac,</hi> &amp;c. (a long ſtring of barbarous words) was the lord of a manor, had a court leet, court baron, and, in a word, every privilege which it ſeems to have been poſſible for the monarch to beſtow, or for the ſubject to acquire<note n="(9)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Vide</hi> Spelman <hi>v. Manerium.</hi> The poſition uſed by Fineux in 12 H. 7. 15. that the Leet is derived out of the Sheriffs Tourn is not intitled to any particular notice, being a mere unſupported <hi>dictum;</hi> to which neither Lord Cokes adoption (2 Inſt. 71.) nor that of Lord Mansfield, (3 Bur. 1860.) can add any weight. Much matter and many authorities muſt be ſacrificed throughout this little enquiry for the ſake of brevity. As to the reſt, the word Leet, though generally appropriated to the court of a manor, has in fact nothing eſſentially diſtinct from the Tourn, but the being upon a ſmaller ſcale. (See, however, Britton. c. 29. 44 E. 3. 9. 1 E. 4. c. 2.) Thoſe writers therefor who ſuppoſe the Leet of a hundred or manor inferior to or ſubject to the controul of the Tourn or Leet of the County are egregiously miſtaken: the juriſdiction of the latter being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſo much of the county or hundred as is not compriſed within the precinct of the manor. See 4 Inſt. 261: It is indeed repeatedly ſaid in our old books that things of which the Leet (of a manor, that is) omits to enquire ſhall be enquired of in the Tourn: which may well be; and the reaſon is that the lord has forfeited his leet for the time, <hi>quoad</hi> the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular object: it being very clear that, when the Leet of a manor is by any means loſt the reſiants owe ſuit to the tourn, and that although they ſhould be within a hundred in the hands of a private perſon.</note>.</p>

This venerable monument, which was even then ancient (Pat. 4 E. 2. pl. 2. m. 15. d.) is mentioned by Stow as ſtanding headleſs in 1598.

<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0637201200:98"/>extant of the criminal part of the conſtitution. Before the conqueſt, and probably for ſome time after, this court of the Leet was, if not the ſole, at leaſt the moſt uſual diſpenſary of criminal juſtice in the kingdom. No crime, in thoſe remote ages, appears to have been puniſhed by death, unleſs it were that of open theft, where the offender was taken with the <hi>mainour,</hi> that is, with the thing ſtolen upon him;—and of this crime, and this only, the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance did not belong to the Leet<note n="(36)" place="bottom">The elucidation of this circumſtance would form a curious if not an intereſting article; but could not be eaſily compreſſed within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a note; and, in fact, belongs more properly to a different work.</note> All other offences, of what nature or degree ſoever, ſubjected the party to a mulct or pecuniary fine, which was, in many caſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate and fixed. "For two hundred ſhillings," obſerves an ingenious writer, "you might have killed a peaſant; for ſix times as much a nobleman: for ſix-and-thirty times as much you might have killed the king.

In ſhort, it is very well known that both Sheriff and Coroner have held pleas of the crown ever ſince the granting of the great charter, and do ſo at this day.

In any caſe it is nothing to the Leet.</note>, "the
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0637201200:101"/>juriſdiction of the Leet was abridged, its power to hear and determine taken away;" but it has been ſaid and repeated without due attention either to the nature and conſtitution of the Court, or to the law of the time. No offence, it is well known, is at this day, or, for aught that appears, ever was, heard and determined in the Leet,—nor, before the period refered to, by any other criminal court in the kingdom,—otherwiſe than upon the preſentment of twelve men,—or what we now, in moſt courts, call the Grand Jury. This preſentment, as has been already obſerved, found and eſtabliſhed the fact; and judgement, whether of <hi>miſericordia,</hi> mutilation or death, followed as an incident or matter of courſe, preciſely, indeed, as the puniſhment does at this day on the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict for the king of the petty jury. In fact, therefor, the juriſdiction of the Leet was not in the leaſt abridged or affected by that charter; nor is it at all probable that the Barons would either ſeek or ſuffer the diminution of their own privileges, of which, on the contrary, there is an expreſs ſaving.</p>
                  <p>That this court has no power to enquire of the death of a man, or of rape<note n="(43)" place="bottom">Lete &amp; Hundr. 10 Br.

The contrary is moſt directly and expreſsly held in the <hi>Statutum Walliae,</hi> in Britton, Fleta, the Mirror, and the ſtatute (or whatever it is) of 18 Ed. 2. all much older and better authorities than the book of Aſſiſes<note n="(44)" place="bottom">41 E. 3. pl. 30. A doubt is ſuggeſted in 9 H. 6. 44. whether the Leet can enquire of high treaſon, and an opinion given in Br.

It is a no leſs extraordinary <hi>dictum</hi> in Dyer, 233, b. that an indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of aſſault and battery found in the Leet, <hi>without blood ſhed,</hi> is void; the principal caſe being a <hi>fine</hi> for an aſſault, <hi>in diſturbance and contempt of the Court.</hi> He might poſſibly allude to the book caſe of 8 E. 4. 5. which by no means ſupports his doctrine; as the plaintiff, whoſe counſel makes that allegation, took nothing by his writ.</note>, in which that opinion firſt appears. If, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0637201200:102"/>the reaſon of the exception be that the enquiry of theſe two crimes belonged properly to the Coroner, it may be readily admitted without impeaching the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Leet.

It follows, therefor, that in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, either where he could not, or did not, act, the enquiry muſt be in the Leet, otherwiſe the offender ſhould have eſcaped without puniſhment, which would be abſurd.

On the contrary, there is no offence which it ever did or could enquire of and
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0637201200:104"/>puniſh, which it may not equally enquire of and puniſh at this day. That the tourn and the leet have been ſo long in a declining way is not, however, at all owing to the cauſe refered to by a learned writer<note n="(53)" place="bottom">4 Black. Com. 274.</note>, <hi>i. e.</hi> the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge granted by the ſtatute of Marlbridge (in which, by the way, the Leet is not mentioned) to all prelates, peers, and clergymen, from their attendance on theſe courts; ſince the county court and court baron, which they are ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to attend (at leaſt by attorney), are ſcarcely in a more flouriſhing condition. Neither is it perfectly clear that "experience has ſhewn the wiſdom of widening the circle of both civil and criminal juriſdiction"<note n="(54)" place="bottom">3 Burr. 1864.</note>. Changes may be for the worſe as well as for the better. True it is that the buſineſs of the Leet hath for the moſt part gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually devolved upon the quarter ſeſſions<note n="(55)" place="bottom">4 Black. Com. 274.</note>; but many reaſons may be given for this circumſtance much more plauſible than thoſe already mentioned. In the firſt place the increaſed population, and more commercial turn of the country, and the conſequent increaſe of offenders and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, required the diſpenſaries of juſtice to be, if not always, at leaſt frequently, open: whereas the Leet is ſeldom held more than twice, and ſometimes but once, in the year; though it may certainly be kept open by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment from month to month, from week to week, or even from day to day. Secondly, the juriſdiction of this court is, upon whatever principle, confined to offences at the common law, which are become leſs numerous than thoſe created by act of parliament. A third reaſon may be, the Steward of a Leet ſeldom reſides upon the ſpot; juſtices of peace, on the contrary, are every where to be
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0637201200:105"/>met with, and by keeping, in a manner, open ſhop, make their profeſſion and powers familiar to the people, who love to buy law, one would think, as they do any other commodity. The learned commentator is therefor in the right where he reckons "the almoſt entire diſuſe and contempt of the court-leet, and ſheriffs-tourn, the kings ancient courts of common law; formerly," he obſerves, "much revered and reſpected," among the miſchievous effects of the change in the adminiſtration of juſtice, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>The difference between a fine and amerciament is, that the former is the ſole act of the court; the latter muſt be grounded upon the preſentments of the jury, and muſt likewiſe be affeered, <hi>i. e.</hi> aſcertained or reduced to certainty, by indifferent perſons ſworn for that purpoſe, and who are generally, but not neceſſarily, taken out of the jury (See E. C. 1754 and 1772, inſtances of the affeerers not being jurymen). It ſeems requiſite however that they ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature of the offence in reſpect whereof the amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is impoſed. A fine on the contrary needs no affeerment, being impoſed by the ſteward as judge, for offences committed within his own view, or the defaults of the officers of the court. A fine on an officer is likewiſe called an amerciament or amerciament royal, but does not on that account require any affeering. Unleſs, therefor, John Aſhley was in office, this fine was illegal.</p>
                              <p>Till the year 1787, (M. C.) the amerciaments were always ſet by the jury in their preſentments, at an expreſs ſum, which was afterward affeered. But this practice, being thought irregular, was then altered, upon due deliberation and good advice; ſo that then and thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the amerciament was and has been ſet by the court indefinitely, "and therefor he is amerced," anſwering to the <hi>Ideo ipſe in miſericordia</hi> of the old precedents; and afterward affeered at a preciſe ſum. It ſhould be noticed, however, that ſome inſtances have been ſince diſcovered where an amerciament is ſet upon the preſentments of the aleconners, &amp;c. in the very language now adopted, "and therefore he is amerced;" which may induce one to believe that it is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of the ancient practice.

                           <p>This inquiſition is, in many reſpects, an admirable record, and the plan very accurately and neatly delineated.

Whether there were any blame in not enquiring more minutely into a matter ſo important as evey this is which men have to deliver upon oath as a guide to poſterity, and upon whom it ought to fall, we cannot well ſay. But the reaſon and cauſe of this ſerious miſtake was in truth as follows: Soon after the 44th Eliz. which was the year 1602, being the laſt of her reign, the ancient lane called Ivy Lane or Ivy Bridge Lane, was by virtue of a grant under the Duchy ſeal and of a writ of <hi>ad quod dumnam,</hi> and an inquiſition thereon, taken away or blocked up by Sir Robert Cecil, afterward Earl of Saliſbury, who, in lieu thereof, opened a new lane or paſſage from the Strand to the river on the weſt ſide of his houſe, which retained the old name of Ivy Lane, as a bridge at the bottom of it did that of Ivy Bridge<note n="*" place="bottom">The ancient bridge was of a very different nature.
