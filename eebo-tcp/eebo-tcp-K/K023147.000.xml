            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IN the Reign of Queen ANNE,
(which notwithſtanding thoſe
happy Times which ſucceeded,
every Engliſhman may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
thou may'ſt poſſibly, gentle
Reader, have ſeen a certain Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Perſon who frequented
the Outſide of the Palace of St.
James's, and who by the Gravity
of his Deportment and Habit,
was generally taken for a decay'd
Gentleman of Spain. His ſtature
was tall, his viſage long, his
complexion olive, his brows were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0063300200:3"/>
black and even, his eyes hollow
yet piercing, his noſe inclin'd to
Aquiline, his beard neglected and
mix'd with grey: All this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to ſpread a ſolemn Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
over his countenance.
Pythagoras was not more ſilent,
Pyrrho more motionleſs, nor
Zeno more auſtere. His Wig
was as black and ſmooth as the
plumes of a Raven, and hung
as ſtrait as the hair of a River-God
riſing from the water. His
Cloak ſo compleatly covered his
whole perſon, that whether or
no he had any other cloaths
(much leſs any linnen) under it,
I ſhall not ſay; but his ſword
appear'd a full yard behind him,
and his manner of wearing it
was ſo ſtiff, that it ſeem'd grown
to his Thigh. his whole figure
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0063300200:4"/>
was ſo utterly unlike any thing of
this world, that it was not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for any man to ask him a
queſtion without bleſſing himſelf
firſt, Thoſe who never ſaw a
<hi>Jeſuit,</hi> took him for one, and
others believed him ſome <hi>High
Prieſt of the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But under this macerated form
was conceal'd a Mind replete
with Science, burning with a
Zeal of benefiting his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures,
and filled with an
honeſt conſcious Pride, mix'd
with a ſcorn of doing or ſuffering
the leaſt thing beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a Philoſopher. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he had a ſoul that would
not let him accept of any offers
of Charity, at the ſame time
that his body ſeem'd but too
much to require it. His lodging
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0063300200:5"/>
was in a ſmall chamber up four
pair of ſtairs, where he regularly
payed for what he had when he
eat or drank, and he was often
obſerved wholly to abſtain from
both. He declin'd ſpeaking to
any one, except the Queen, or
her firſt Miniſter, to whom he
attempted to make ſome appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;
but his real buſineſs or
intentions were utterly unknown
to all men. Thus much is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that he was obnoxious to
the Queen's Miniſtry; who either
out of Jealouſy or Envy, had
him ſpirited away, and carried
abroad as a dangerous perſon,
without any regard to the known
Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>One day, as this Gentleman
was walking about dinner-time
alone in the Mall, it happen'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0063300200:6"/>
that a Manuſcript dropt from
under his cloak, which my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
pick'd up, and brought to
me. It was written in the Latin
tongue, and contain'd many
moſt profound Secrets, in an
unuſual turn of reaſoning and
ſtyle. The firſt leaf was inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with theſe words, <hi>Codicillus,
ſeú Liber Memorialis, Martini
Scribleri.</hi> The Book was of ſo
wonderful a nature, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
what a deſire I conceiv'd
that moment to be acquainted
with the Author, who I clearly
perceiv'd was ſome great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
in diſguiſe. I ſeveral times
endeavour'd to ſpeak to him,
which he as often induſtriouſly
avoided. At length I found an
opportunity (as he ſtood under
the Piazza by the Dancing-room
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0063300200:7"/>
in St. James's) to acquaint him
in the Latin tongue, that his
Manuſcript was fallen into my
hands: and ſaying this, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it to him, with great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums
on the learned Author.
Hereupon he took me aſide,
ſurvey'd me over with a fix'd
attention, and opening the claſps
of the Parchment cover, ſpoke
(to my great ſurprize) in Engliſh,
as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">" Courteous ſtranger, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou art, I embrace thee
as my beſt friend; for either
the Stars and my Art are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,
or the deſtin'd time
is come which is to manifeſt
Martinus Scriblerus to the
world, and thou the perſon
choſen by fate for this task.
What thou ſeeſt in me is a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0063300200:8"/>
body exhauſted by the labours
of the mind. I have found
in Dame Nature not indeed an
unkind, but a very coy Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs:
Watchful nights, anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
days, ſlender meals, and
endleſs labours, muſt be the
lot of all who purſue her,
through her labyrinths and
meanders. My firſt vital air
I drew in this Iſland (a ſoil
fruitful of Philoſophers) but
my complexion is become
aduſt, and my body arid, by
viſiting lands (as the Poet has
it) <hi>alio ſub ſole calentes.</hi> I
have, through my whole life,
paſſed under ſeveral diſguiſes
and unknown names, to ſkreen
my ſelf from the envy and
malice which mankind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
againſt thoſe who are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0063300200:9"/>
poſſeſſed of the <hi>Arcanum
Magnum.</hi> But at preſent I
am forc'd to take Sanctuary
in the Britiſh Court, to avoid
the Revenge of a cruel Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
who has purſued me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
through the whole ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous
globe. Being about
four years ago in the City of
Madrid in queſt of natural
knowledge, I was informed
of a Lady who was marked
with a Pomegranate upon the
inſide of her right Thigh,
which bloſſom'd, and, as it
were, ſeem'd to ripen in the
due ſeaſon. Forthwith was
I poſſeſſed with an inſatiable
curioſity to view this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Phaenomenon. I felt the
ardour of my paſſion encreaſe
as the ſeaſon advanced, till in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0063300200:10"/>
the month of July I could no
longer contain. I bribed her
Duenna, was admitted to the
Bath, ſaw her undreſs'd, and
the wonder diſplay'd. This
was ſoon after diſcovered by
the huſband, who finding
ſome letters I had writ to the
Duenna, containing expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of a doubtful meaning,
ſuſpected me of a crime moſt
alien from the Purity of my
Thoughts. Incontinently I
left Madrid by the advice of
friends, have been purſued,
dogg'd, and way-laid through
ſeveral Nations, and even now
ſcarce think my ſelf ſecure
within the ſacred walls of this
Palace. It has been my good
fortune to have ſeen all the
grand Phaenomena of Nature,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0063300200:11"/>
excepting an Earthquake, which
I waited for in Naples three
years in vain; and now by
means of ſome Britiſh Ship
(whoſe Colours no Spaniard
dares approach) I impatiently
expect, a ſafe paſſage to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,
for that benefit. To
thee my Friend, whom Fate
has marked for my Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher,
I leave theſe my
Commentaries, and others of
my works, No more—be
faithful and impartial."</q>
            </p>
            <p>He ſoon after performed his
promiſe, and left me the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
giving me alſo further
lights by many Conferences; when
he was unfortunately ſnatch'd
away (as I before related) by the
jealouſy of the Queen's Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0063300200:12"/>
Tho' I was thus to my eternal
grief depriv'd of his converſation,
he for ſome years continued his
Correſpondence, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to me many of his Projects
for the benefit of mankind. He
ſent me ſome of his Writings, and
recommended to my care the
recovery of others, ſtraggling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the world, and aſſumed by
other men. The laſt time I heard
from him was on occaſion of his
Strictures on the Dunciad: ſince
when, ſeveral years being elaps'd,
I have reaſon to believe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Perſon is either dead, or
carry'd by his vehement thirſt of
knowledge into ſome remote, or
perhaps undiſcover'd Region of
the world. In either caſe, I think
it a debt no longer to be delay'd,
to reveal what I know of this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0063300200:13"/>
Prodigy of Science, and to give
the Hiſtory of his life, and of his
extenſive merits to mankind; in
which I dare promiſe the Reader,
that whenever he begins to think
any one Chapter dull, the ſtyle
will be immediately changed in
the next.</p>

how he was begot, what Care was

what Prodigies attended his Birth.</head>
            <p>IN the City of Munſter in Germany,
lived a grave and learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
by Profeſſion an Antiquary; who
among all his invaluable Curioſities,
eſteemed none more highly, than a Skin
of the true Pergamenian Parchment,
which hung at the upper-end of his
hall. On this was curiouſly traced the
ancient Pedigree of the <hi>Scribleri,</hi> with
all their Alliances and collateral Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0063300200:15"/>
(among which were reckon'd Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Magnus, Paracelſus Bombaſtus, and
the famous Scaligers in old time Princes
of Verona) and deduced even from the
Times of the Elder Pliny to Cornelius
Scriblerus: For ſuch was the name of
this venerable Perſonage; whoſe glory
it was, that by the ſingular Virtue of
the Women, not one had a Head of a
different Caſt from his family.</p>
            <p>His wife was a Lady of ſingular
beauty, whom not for that reaſon only
he eſpouſed, but becauſe ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
daughter either of the great
Scriverius, or of Gaſpar Barthius. It
happen'd on a time, the ſaid Gaſpar
made a viſit to Scriverius at Harlem,
taking with him a comely Lady of his
acquaintance who was ſkilful in the
Greek Tongue, of whom the learned
Scriverius became ſo enamour'd, as to
inebriate his friend, and be familiar
with his Miſtreſs. I am not ignorant
of what  <note n="*" place="bottom">Columeſius relates this from Iſaac Voſſius, in his Opuſcul. p. 102.</note>Columeſius affirms, that the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0063300200:16"/>
learned Barthius was not ſo overtaken
but he perceiv'd it; and in Revenge
ſuffer'd this unfortunate Gentlewoman
to be drowned in the Rhine at her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
But Mrs. Scriblerus (the iſſue
of that Amour) was a living proof of
the falſehood of this Report. Dr. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
was further induced to his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
from the certain information that
the aforeſaid Lady, the mother of his
wife, was related to Cardan on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
ſide, and to Aldrovandus on the
mother's: Beſides which, her Anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
had been profeſſors of Phyſick,
Aſtrology, or Chymiſtry, in German
Univerſities, from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>With this fair Gentlewoman had our
Doctor lived in a comfortable Union
for about ten years: But this our ſober
and orderly pair, without any natural
infirmity, and with a conſtant and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
compliance to the chief duty of
conjugal life, were yet unhappy, in that
Heaven had not bleſſed them with any
iſſue. This was the utmoſt grief to
the good man; eſpecially conſidering
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0063300200:17"/>
what exact Precautions and Methods
he had uſed to procure that Bleſſing:
for he never had cohabitation with his
ſpouſe, but he ponder'd on the Rules of
the Ancients, for the generation of
Children of Wit. He ordered his diet
according to the preſcription of Galen,
confining himſelf and his wife for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
the whole firſt year to  <note n="†" place="bottom">Galen Lib. de Cibis boni &amp; mali ſucci. cap. 3.</note>Goat's
Milk and Honey. It unfortunately
befel her, when ſhe was about four
months gone with child, to long for
ſomewhat which that author inveighs
againſt, as prejudicial to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Infant: This her huſband
thought fit to deny her, affirming, it
was better to be childleſs, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Parent of a Fool. His Wife
miſcarried; but as the Abortion proved
only a female Faetus, he comforted
himſelf, that had it arrived to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it would not have anſwer'd his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
his heart being wholly fixed
upon the learned Sex. However he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0063300200:18"/>
diſdained not to treaſure up the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo
in a Vial, among the curioſities of
his family.</p>
            <p>Having diſcovered that Galen's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
could not determine the ſex,
he forthwith betook himſelf to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.
Accordingly he with-held the
nuptial embrace when the wind was
in any point of the South; this <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ariſt. 14. Sect. Prob. 5.</note> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
aſſerting that the groſſneſs and
moiſture of the ſoutherly winds occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the procreation of females, and not
of males. But he redoubled his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
when the wind was at Weſt, a
wind on which that great Philoſopher
beſtowed the Encomiums of Fatner of
the earth, Breath of the Elyſian Fields,
and other glorious Elogies. For our
learned man was clearly of opinion, that
the Semina out of which Animals are
produced, are Animalcula ready form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

ſecond time; and, (what was no ſmall
addition to his happineſs) he juſt then
came to the poſſeſſion of a conſiderable
Eſtate by the death of her Uncle, a
wealthy Jew who reſided at London.
This made it neceſſary for him to take
a journey to England; nor would the
care of his poſterity let him ſuffer his
Wife to remain behind him. During
the voyage, he was perpetually taken
up on the one hand, how to employ his
great Riches; and on the other, how
to educate his Child. He had already
determin'd to ſet apart ſeveral annual
Sums, for the recovery of <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi>
the effoſſon of <hi>Coins,</hi> the procuring of
<hi>Mummies</hi>; and for all thoſe curious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
by which he hoped to become
(as himſelf was wont to ſay) a ſecond
<hi>Peireſkius.</hi> He had already chalked
out all poſſible ſchemes for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a male child, yet was ſo far
prepar'd for the worſt that could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
that before the nine months were
expired, he had compoſed two Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes
of Education; the one he called
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0063300200:20"/>
               <hi>A Daughter's Mirrour,</hi> and the other
<hi>A Son's Monitor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all we can find relating to
Martinus, while he was in his Mother's
womb, excepting that he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
there with a Conſort of Muſick
once in twenty four hours, according to
the Cuſtom of the Magi: and that on
a <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ramſey's Cyrus.</note> particular day, he was obſerved to
leap and kick exceedingly, which was
on the firſt of April, the birth-day of
the great <hi>Baſilius Valentinus.</hi>

            <p>The Truth of this, and every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Fact, may be depended upon,
being taken literally from the Memoirs.
But I muſt be ſo ingenuous as to own,
that the Accounts are not ſo certain of
the exact time and place of his birth.
As to the firſt, he had the common
frailty of old men, to conceal his age:
as to the ſecond, I only remember to
have heard him ſay, that he firſt ſaw
the light in St. Giles's Pariſh. But in
the inveſtigation of this point, Fortune
hath favoured our diligence. For one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0063300200:21"/>
day as I was paſſing by the <hi>Seven Dials,</hi>
I overheard a diſpute concerning the
place of Nativity of a great Aſtrologer,
which each man alledged to have been
in his own ſtreet. The circumſtances
of the time, and the deſcription of the
perſon, made me imagine it might be
that univerſal Genius whoſe life I am
writing. I returned home, and having
maturely conſidered their ſeveral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which I found to be of equal
weight, I quieted my curioſity with
this natural concluſion, that he was born
in ſome point common to all the ſeven
ſtreets; which muſt be that on which
the Column is now erected. And it is
with infinite pleaſure that I ſince find
my Conjecture confirmed, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
paſſage in the Codicil to Mr.

            <p>Nor was the Birth of this great man
unattended with Prodigies: He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
has often told me, that on the night
before he was born, Mrs. Scriblerus
dream'd ſhe was brought to bed of a
huge <hi>Ink-horn,</hi> out of which iſſued
ſeveral large ſtreams of Ink, as it had
been a fountain. This dream was by
her huſband thought to ſignify, that the
child ſhould prove a very voluminous
Writer. Likewiſe a <note n="*" place="bottom">Virgil's Laurel Donat.</note>
               <hi>Crab-tree</hi> that
had been hitherto barren, appeared on
a ſudden laden with a vaſt quantity of
Crabs: This ſign alſo the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
imagined to be a prognoſtic of the
acuteneſs of his Wit. A great ſwarm
of <note n="†" place="bottom">Plato, Lucan, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>Waſps</hi> play'd round his Cradle
without hurting him, but were very
troubleſome to all in the room beſides:
This ſeemed a certain preſage of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his Satire. A Dunghill was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0063300200:23"/>
ſeen within the ſpace of one night to be
covered all over with <hi>Muſhroom:</hi> This
ſome interpreted to promiſe the infant
great fertility of fancy, but no long
duration to his works: but the Father
was of another opinion.</p>
            <p>But what was of all moſt wonderful,
was a thing that ſeemed a monſtrous
<hi>Fowl,</hi> which juſt then dropt through
the ſky-light, near his wife's apartment.
It had a large body, two little diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
wings, a prodigious tail, but
no head. As its colour was white, he
took it at firſt ſight for a Swan, and
was concluding his ſon would be a
Poet: but on a nearer view, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it to be ſpeckled with black, in
the form of letters; and that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a Paper kite which had broke its
leaſh by the impetuoſity of the wind.
His back was armed with the Art
Military, his belly was filled with Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
his wings were the wings of Quarles
and Withers, the ſeveral Nodes of his
voluminous tail were diverſify'd with
ſeveral branches of Science; where the
Doctor beheld with great joy a knot of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0063300200:24"/>
Logick, a knot of Metaphyſick, a knot
of Caſuiſtry, a knot of Polemical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and a knot of Common Law, with
a <hi>Lanthorn</hi> of <hi>Jacob Behmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There went a Report in the family,
that as ſoon as he was born he uttered
the voice of nine ſeveral animals: he
cry'd like a Calf, bleated like a Sheep,
chattered like a Mag-pye, grunted like
a Hog, neighed like a Foal, croaked
like a Raven, mewed like a Cat, gab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
like a Gooſe, and bray'd like an
Aſs. And the next morning he was
found playing in his bed with two
Owls, which came down the chimney.
His Father greatly rejoyced at all theſe
ſigns, which betokened the variety of
his Eloquence, and the extent of his
Learning; but he was more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
pleaſed with the laſt, as it nearly

            <p>NO ſooner was the cry of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant

ruſhed into the Room, and ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in his arms, examin'd every limb
with attention. He was infinitely
pleas'd to find, that the Child had the
Wart of Cicero, the wry Neck of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,
knots upon his legs like Marius,
and one of them ſhorter than the other
like Ageſilaus. The good Cornelius
alſo hoped he would come to ſtammer
like Demoſthenes, in order to be as elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
and in time arrive at many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Defects of famous men. He held
the child ſo long, that the Midwife

how to paſs this day more agreeably
to his Character; that is to ſay, not
without ſome <hi>Profitable Conference,</hi> nor
wholly without obſervance of ſome
<hi>Ancient Cuſtom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He remembred to have read in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocritus,
that the Cradle of Hercules was
a Shield; and being poſſeſs'd of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
<hi>Buckler</hi> which he held as a moſt
ineſtimable Relick, he determined to
have the infant laid therein, and in
that manner brought into the Study,
to be ſhown to certain learned men of
his acquaintance.</p>
            <p>The regard he had for this Shield,
had cauſed him formerly to compile a
Diſſertation concerning it, proving
from the ſeveral properties, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the colour of the Ruſt, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
chronology thereof.</p>
            <p>With this Treatiſe, and a moderate
ſupper, he propoſed to entertain his
Gueſts; tho' he had alſo another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
to have their aſſiſtance in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of his Son's <hi>Nativity.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0063300200:31"/>
He therefore took the Buckler out
of a Caſe (in which he always kept it
leaſt it might contract any modern
ruſt), and entruſted it to his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
with orders, that when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was come ſhe ſhould lay the
Child carefully in it, cover'd with a
mantle of blue Sattin.</p>
            <p>The Gueſts were no ſooner ſeated,
but they entered into a warm Debate
about the <hi>Triclinium</hi> and the manner
of <hi>Decubitus</hi> of the Ancients, which
Cornelius broke off in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This day, my Friends, I purpoſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
my ſon before you; a Child not
wholly unworthy of Inſpection, as he is
deſcended from a Race of Virtuoſi. Let
the Phiſiognomiſts examine his features;
let the Chirographiſts behold his Palm;
but above all let us conſult for the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of his Nativity. To this end,
as the child is not vulgar, I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
him unto you in a vulgar manner.
He ſhall be cradled in my Ancient Shield,
ſo famous through the Univerſities of
Europe. You all know how I purchas'd

inexpreſſible grief of all Germany. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in every circumſtance, but that it broke
the heart of the great Melchior Inſipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he ſtopp'd his Speech, upon
ſight of the Maid, who enter'd the
room with the Child: He took it in
his arms and proceeded:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold then my Child, but firſt behold
the Shield: Behold this Ruſt,—or
rather let me call it this precious Aerugo,—behold
this beautiful Varniſh of
Time,—this venerable Verdure of
ſo many Ages—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking theſe words, he ſlowly
lifted up the Mantle, which cover'd it,
inch by inch; but at every inch he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
his cheeks grew paler, his hand
trembled, his nerves failed, till on ſight
of the whole the Tremor became uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal:
The Shield and the Infant both
dropt to the ground, and he had only
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0063300200:33"/>
ſtrength enough to cry out, <hi>O God!
my Shield, my Shield!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth was, the Maid (extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern'd for the reputation of her
own cleanlineſs, and her young maſter's
honour) had ſcoured it as clean as her
Andirons.</p>
            <p>Cornelius ſunk back on a chair, the
Gueſts ſtood aſtoniſhed, the infant
ſquawl'd, the maid ran in, ſnatch'd it
up again in her arms, flew into her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes

ſeparately, but conſtantly mingles them
together. Thus at the ſame time hath
Heav'n bleſs'd me with the birth of a
Son, and afflicted me with the ſcouring
of my Shield. Yet let us not repine at
his Diſpenſations, who gives and who
takes away; but rather join in prayer,
that the Ruſt of Antiquity which he hath
been pleas'd to take from my Shield, may
be added to my Son; and that ſo much

remov'd for ever from his eyes. It
was not long after purchas'd by Dr.
Woodward, who, by the aſſiſtance of
Mr. Kemp incruſted it with a new
Ruſt, and is the ſame whereof a Cut
hath been engraved, and exhibited to
the great Contentation of the learned.</p>
            <p>Cornelius now began to regulate the

paſs a day without diſputes between

concerning the nature of Aliment.
The poor woman never dined but he
denied her ſome diſh or other, which
he judg'd prejudicial to her milk. One
day ſhe had a longing deſire to a piece
of beef, and as ſhe ſtretch'd her hand
towards it, the old gentleman drew it
away, and ſpoke to this effect. <hi>Had'ſt

Beef, it is true, may confer a Robuſtneſs
on the limbs of my ſon, but will hebetate
and clogg his Intellectuals.</hi> While he
ſpoke this, the Nurſe look'd upon him
with much anger, and now and then
caſt a wiſhful eye upon the Beef—<hi>Paſſion (continu'd the Doctor, ſtill hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the diſh) throws the mind into too
violent a fermentation; it is a kind of
Fever of the ſoul, or, as Horace expreſſes
it, a</hi> Short Madneſs. <hi>Conſider Woman,
that this day's Suction of my ſon may
cauſe him to imbibe many ungovernable
Paſſions, and in a manner ſpoil him for
the temper of a Philoſopher. Romulus</hi>

ſavage diſpoſition; and were I to breed
ſome Ottoman Emperor or Founder of a
Military Commonwealth, perhaps I might
indulge thee in this carnivorous Appetite.</hi>—What,
interrupted the Nurſe, Beef
ſpoil the underſtanding? that's fine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed—how
then could our Parſon
preach as he does upon Beef, and Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
too, if you go to that? Don't tell
me of your Ancients, had not you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
kill'd the poor babe with a diſh
of Daemonial black Broth?—<hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian
black Broth, thou would'ſt ſay,
(reply'd Cornelius) but I cannot allow
the ſurfeit to have been occaſioned by that
diet, ſince it was recommended by the
Divine Lycurgus. No, Nurſe, thou
muſt certainly have eaten ſome meats of
ill digeſtion the day before, and that was
the real cauſe of his diſorder. Conſider
Woman, the different Temperaments of
different Nations: What makes the
Engliſh Phlegmatick and melancholy but
Beef? what renders the Welch ſo hot
and cholerick, but cheeſe and leeks? the
French derive their levity from their</hi>

               <hi>Soups, Frogs, and Muſhrooms: I would
not let my Son dine like an Italian, leſt
like an Italian he ſhould be jealous and
revengeful: The warm and ſolid diet of
Spain may be more beneficial, as it might
indue him with a profound Gravity, but
at the ſame time he might ſuck in with
their food their intolerable Vice of Pride.
Therefore Nurſe, in ſhort, I hold it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to deny you at preſent, not only Beef,
but likewiſe whatſoever any of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
eat.</hi> During this ſpeech, the
Nurſe remain'd pouting and marking
her plate with the knife, nor would
ſhe touch a bit during the whole din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
This the old Gentleman obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
order'd that the Child, to avoid
the riſque of imbibing ill humours,
ſhould be kept from her breaſt all that
day, and be fed with Butter mix'd
with Honey, according to a Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had met with ſomewhere in
Euſtathius upon Homer. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
gave the Child a great looſeneſs,
but he was not concern'd at it, in the
opinion that whatever harm it might
do his body, would be amply recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0063300200:40"/>
by the improvements of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
But from thenceforth
he inſiſted every day upon a particular
Diet to be obſerved by the Nurſe; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which having been long uneaſy,
ſhe at laſt parted from the family, on
his ordering her for dinner the <hi>Paps</hi> of
a <hi>Sow</hi> with Pig; taking it as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
indignity, and a direct Inſult upon
her Sex and Calling.</p>
            <p>Four years of young Martin's life
paſs'd away in ſquabbles of this nature.
Mrs. Scriblerus conſider'd it was now
time to inſtruct him in the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Religion, and to that end took
no ſmall pains in teaching him his <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm:</hi>
But Cornelius look'd upon this
as a tedious way of Inſtruction, and
therefore employ'd his head to find out
more pleaſing methods, the better to
induce him to be fond of learning.
He would frequently carry him to the
<hi>Puppet-ſhow,</hi> of the Creation of the
world, where the Child with exceeding
delight gain'd a notion of the Hiſtory
of the Bible. His firſt rudiments in
profane hiſtory were acquired by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0063300200:41"/>
of <hi>Raree-ſhows,</hi> where he was
brought acquainted with all the Princes
of Europe. In ſhort the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſo contriv'd it, to make every
thing contribute to the improvement
of his knowledge, even to his very
Dreſs. He invented for him a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical
ſuit of cloaths, which might
give him ſome hints of that Science,
and likewiſe ſome knowledge of the
Commerce of different Nations. He
had a French Hat with an African
Feather, Holland Shirts and Flanders
Lace, Engliſh Cloth lin'd with Indian
Silk, his Gloves were Italian, and his
Shoes were Spaniſh: He was made to
obſerve this, and daily catechis'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
which his Father was wont to
call <hi>Travelling at home.</hi> He never
gave him a Fig or an Orange but he
obliged him to give an account from
what Country it came. In Natural
hiſtory he was much aſſiſted by his
Curioſity in <hi>Sign-Poſts,</hi> inſomuch that
he hath often confeſs'd he owed to
them the knowledge of many Creatures
which he never found ſince in any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0063300200:42"/>
ſuch as White Lions, Golden
Dragons, &amp;c. He once thought the
ſame of Green Men, but had ſince
found them mention'd by Kercherus,
and verify'd in the Hiſtory of William
of Newbury.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gul. Neubrig. Book i. Ch. 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>His diſpoſition to the Mathematicks
was diſcover'd very early, by his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
 <note n="†" place="bottom">Paſcal's Life. Locke of Educ. &amp;c.</note> parallel lines on his bread and
butter, and interſecting them at equal
Angles, ſo as to form the whole Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
into ſquares. But in the midſt
of all theſe Improvements, a ſtop was
put to his learning the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> nor
would he let him proceed to Letter D,
till he could truly and diſtinctly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
C in the ancient manner, at
which the Child unhappily boggled for
near three months. He was alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
to delay his learning to <hi>write,</hi>
having turn'd away the Writing Maſter
becauſe he knew nothing of Fabius's
Waxen Tables.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0063300200:43"/>
Cornelius having read, and ſeriouſly
weigh'd the methods by which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Montaigne was educated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
in ſome degree to exceed them,
reſolv'd he ſhould ſpeak and learn no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the learned Languages, and
eſpecially the Greek; in which he
conſtantly eat and drank, according to
Homer. But what moſt conduced to
his eaſy attainment of this Language,
was his love of Ginger-bread; which
his Father obſerving, cauſed it to be
ſtampt with the Letters of the Greek
Alphabet; and the child the very firſt
day eat as far as Iota. By this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
application to this language above
the reſt, he attain'd ſo great a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience
therein, that Gronovius inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
confeſſes he durſt not confer
with this child in Greek at eight years
old; and at fourteen he compoſed a
Tragedy in the ſame language, as the
younger <note n="*" place="bottom">Plin. Epiſt. Lib. 7.</note>Pliny had done before him.</p>
            <p>He learn'd the Oriental Languages
of Erpenius who reſided ſome time
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0063300200:44"/>
with his father for that purpoſe. He
had ſo early a Reliſh for the Eaſtern
way of writing, that even at this time
he compoſed (in imitation of it) the
<hi>Thouſand and One Arabian Tales,</hi> and
alſo the <hi>Perſian Tales,</hi> which have been
ſince tranſlated into ſeveral languages,
and lately into our own with particular
elegance, by Mr. Ambroſe Philips. In
this work of his Childhood, he was
not a little aſſiſted by the hiſtorical
Traditions of his <hi>Nurſe.</hi>

            <head>A Diſſertation upon Play-things.</head>
            <p>HERE follow the Inſtructions
of Cornelius Scriblerus concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Plays and Play-things to be
uſed by his ſon Martin.</p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>' <hi>Play</hi> was invented by the <hi>Lydians</hi>
as a remedy againſt <hi>Hunger.</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles
ſays of Palamedes, that he
invented <hi>Dice</hi> to ſerve ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a dinner. It is therefore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0063300200:45"/>
wiſely contrived by Nature, that
Children, as they have the keeneſt
<hi>Appetites,</hi> are moſt addicted to <hi>Plays.</hi>
From the ſame cauſe, and from the
unprejudic'd and incorrupt ſimplicity
of their minds it proceeds, that the
Plays of the Ancient Children are
preſerv'd more entire than any other
of their Cuſtoms. In this matter I
would recommend to all who have
any concern in my Son's Education,
that they deviate not in the leaſt from
the primitive and ſimple Antiquity.</p>
               <p>' To ſpeak firſt of the <hi>Whiſtle,</hi> as it
is the firſt of all Play-things. I will
have it exactly to correſpond with the
ancient <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and accordingly to
be compos'd, <hi>ſeptem paribus disjuncta
cicutis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' I heartily wiſh a diligent ſearch
may be made after the true <hi>Crepita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi>
or <hi>Rattle</hi> of the Ancients, for
that (as <hi>Archytas Tarentinus</hi> was of
opinion) kept the children from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Earthen Ware. The <hi>China</hi> Cups
in theſe days are not at all the ſafer
for the modern <hi>Rattles</hi>; which is an
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0063300200:46"/>
evident proof how far their <hi>Crepita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi>
exceeded ours.</p>
               <p>' I would not have Martin as yet to
ſcourge a <hi>Top,</hi> till I am better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
whether the <hi>Trochus</hi> which
was recommended by <hi>Cato</hi> be really
our preſent <hi>Top,</hi> or rather the <hi>Hoop</hi>
which the boys drive with a ſtick.
Neither <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Pile,</hi> nor <hi>Ducks</hi>
and <hi>Drakes</hi> are quite ſo ancient as
<hi>Handy-dandy,</hi> tho' Marcobius and St.
Auguſtine take notice of the firſt, and
Minutius Foelix deſcribes the latter;
but <hi>Handy-dandy</hi> is mention'd by
Ariſtotle, Plato, and Ariſtophanes.</p>
               <p>' The Play which the Italians call
<hi>Cinque,</hi> and the French <hi>Mourre,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ancient; it was play'd at by
<hi>Hymen</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> at the Marriage of
<hi>Pſyche,</hi> and term'd by the Latins,
<hi>digitis micare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' Julius Pollux deſcribes the <hi>Omilla</hi>
or <hi>Chuck farthing:</hi> tho' ſome will
have our modern <hi>Chuck-farthing</hi> to
be nearer the <hi>Aphetinda</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.
He alſo mentions the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilinda,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0063300200:47"/>
or <hi>King I am</hi>; and <hi>Myinda,</hi>
or <hi>Hoopers-Hide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' But the <hi>Chytindra</hi> deſcribed by the
ſame Author is certainly not our
<hi>Hot-cockle</hi>; for that was by pinching
and not by ſtriking; tho' there are
good authors who affirm the <hi>Ratha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pygiſmus</hi>
to be yet nearer the modern
<hi>Hot-cockle.</hi> My ſon Martin may
uſe either of them indifferently, they
being equally antique.</p>
               <p>' <hi>Building of Houſes,</hi> and <hi>Riding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sticks</hi> have been uſed by children
in all ages, <hi>Aedificare caſas, equitare
in arundine longa.</hi> Yet I muſt doubt
whether the Riding upon Sticks did
not come into uſe after the age of
the <hi>Centaurs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' There is one Play which ſhews the
gravity of ancient Education, call'd
the <hi>Acinetinda,</hi> in which children
contended who could longeſt <hi>ſtand
ſtill.</hi> This we have ſuffer'd to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
entirely; and if I might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to gueſs, it was certainly firſt
loſt among the <hi>French.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>' Julius Pollux in his ninth book
ſpeaks of the <hi>Melolouthe</hi> or the <hi>Kite</hi>;

is what is moſt taken notice
of, they had doubtleſs <hi>Cock-matches</hi>
alſo, as is evident from certain ancient
Gems and Relievo's.</p>
               <p>' In a word, let my ſon Martin diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
himſelf at any Game truly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
except one, which was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a people among the Thracians,
who hung up one of their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in a Rope, and gave him a Knife
to cut himſelf down; which if he
fail'd in, he was ſuffer'd to hang till
he was dead; and this was only
reckon'd a ſort of joke. I am ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
againſt this, as barbarous and
cruel.</p>
               <p>' I cannot conclude, without taking
notice of the beauty of the <hi>Greek</hi>
names, whoſe Etymologies acquaint
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0063300200:49"/>
us with the nature of the ſports; and
how infinitely, both in ſenſe and
ſound, they excel our barbarous names
of Plays.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the foregoing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
of Dr. Cornelius, he yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
to allow the Child the uſe of
ſome few modern Play-things; ſuch
as might prove of any benefit to his
mind, by inſtilling an early notion of
the ſciences. For example, he found
that <hi>Marbles</hi> taught him <hi>Percuſſion</hi> and
the <hi>Laws of Motion</hi>; <hi>Nut-crackers</hi> the
uſe of the <hi>Leaver</hi>; <hi>Swinging</hi> on the
ends of a Board, the <hi>Balance</hi>; <hi>Bottle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrews,</hi>
the <hi>Vice</hi>; <hi>Whirligigs</hi> the <hi>Axis</hi>
and <hi>Peritrochia</hi>; <hi>Bird-cages,</hi> the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>;
and <hi>Tops</hi> the <hi>Centrifugal</hi> motion.</p>
            <p>Others of his ſports were farther
carry'd to improve his tender ſoul even
in Virtue and Morality. We ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtance one of the moſt uſeful and
inſtructive, <hi>Bob-cherry,</hi> which teaches
at once two noble Virtues, Patience
and Conſtancy; the firſt in adhering
to the purſuit of one end, the latter in
bearing a diſappointment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0063300200:50"/>
Beſides all theſe, he taught him as
a diverſion, an odd and ſecret manner
of <hi>Stealing,</hi> according to the Cuſtom
of the Lacedaemonians; wherein he
ſucceeded ſo well, that he practiſed it
to the day of his death.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It was about this time, he heard to

out into his Balcony, his Lyra in hand,
in his ſlippers, with his breeches hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down to his ankles, a ſtocking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his head, and a waiſtcoat of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey-colour'd
ſattin upon his body: He
touch'd his Lyra with a very unuſual
ſort of an Harpegiatura, nor were his
hopes fruſtrated. The odd Equipage,
the uncouth Inſtrument, the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Man and of the Muſick,
drew the ears and eyes of the whole
Mob that were got about the two fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Champions, and at laſt of the
Combatants themſelves. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
the Balcony, in as cloſe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as Orpheus's firſt Audience of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or that of an Italian Opera when
ſome favourite Air is juſt awaken'd.
This ſudden effect of his Muſick en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
him mightily, and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
he never touch'd his Lyre in ſuch
a truly chromatick and enharmonick
manner as upon that occaſion. The
mob laugh'd, ſung, jump'd, danc'd, and
us'd many odd geſtures, all which he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0063300200:61"/>
judg'd to be cauſed by his various ſtrains
and modulations. <hi>Mark (quoth he) in

withdrew, but with the greateſt air of

            <p>COrnelius having (as hath been
ſaid) many ways been diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his attempts of improving the
bodily Forces of his ſon, thought it now
high time to apply to the Culture of
his Internal faculties. He judg'd it
proper in the firſt place to inſtruct him
in <hi>Rhetorick.</hi> But herein we ſhall not
need to give the Reader any account of
his wonderful progreſs, ſince it is already
known to the learned world by his
Treatiſe on this ſubject: I mean the
admirable Diſcourſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which he
wrote at this time but conceal'd from
his Father, knowing his extreme par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
for the Ancients. It lay by him
conceal'd, and perhaps forgot among
the great multiplicity of other Writings,
till about the year 1727, he ſent it us
to be printed, with many additional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
drawn from the excellent live
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0063300200:63"/>
Poets of this preſent age. We proceed
therefore to <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wiſe Cornelius was convinced,
that theſe being <hi>Polemical</hi> Arts, could
no more be learned alone, than Fencing
or Cudgel-playing. He thought it
therefore neceſſary to look out for ſome
Youth of pregnant parts, to be a ſort of
humble Companion to his ſon in thoſe
ſtudies. His good fortune directed him
to one of moſt ſingular endowments,
whoſe name was Conradus Crambe,
who by the father's ſide was related to
the <hi>Crouches</hi> of Cambridge, and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was Couſin to Mr. <hi>Swan,</hi> Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and Punſter of the City of London.
So that from both parents he drew a
natural diſpoſition to ſport himſelf with
<hi>Words,</hi> which as they are ſaid to be
the counters of wiſe Men, and ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money
of Fools, Crambe had great
ſtore of caſh of the latter ſort. Happy
Martin in ſuch a Parent, and ſuch a
Companion! What might not he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
in Arts and Sciences.</p>
            <p>Here I muſt premiſe a general obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of great benefit to mankind.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0063300200:64"/>
That there are many people who have
the uſe only of one Operation of the
Intellect, tho' like ſhort-ſighted men
they can hardly diſcover it themſelves:
They can form <hi>ſingle apprehenſions,</hi> but
have neither of the other two faculties,
the <hi>judicium</hi> or <hi>diſcurſus.</hi> Now as it
is wiſely order'd, that people depriv'd
of one ſenſe have the others in more
perfection, ſuch people will form ſingle
Ideas with a great deal of vivacity; and
happy were it indeed if they would
confine themſelves to ſuch, without
forming <hi>judicia,</hi> much leſs <hi>argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cornelius quickly diſcover'd, that
theſe two laſt operations of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
were very weak in Martin, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
totally extinguiſh'd in Crambe;
however he uſed to ſay that Rules of
Logick are Spectacles to a purblind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and therefore he reſolv'd
to proceed with his two Pupils.</p>
            <p>Martin's underſtanding was ſo total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
immers'd in <hi>ſenſible objects,</hi> that he
demanded examples from Material
things of the abſtracted Ideas of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0063300200:65"/>
As for Crambe, he contented
himſelf with the Words, and when he
could but form ſome conceit upon
them, was fully ſatisfy'd. Thus Crambe
would tell his Inſtructor, that All
men were not <hi>ſingular</hi>; that Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
could hardly be praedicated of
any man, for it was commonly ſaid that
a man <hi>is</hi> not the ſame he <hi>was,</hi> that
madmen are <hi>beſide themſelves,</hi> and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
men <hi>come to themſelves</hi>; which
ſhows, that few men have that moſt
valuable logical endowment, Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.
Cornelius told Martin that a
ſhoulder of mutton was an individual,
which Crambe deny'd, for he had ſeen
it cut into commons: That's true
(quoth the Tutor) but you never ſaw
it cut into ſhoulders of mutton: If it
could (quoth Crambe) it would be the
moſt lovely individual of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
When he was told, a <hi>ſubſtance</hi>
was that which was <hi>ſubject to accidents</hi>;
then Soldiers (quoth Crambe) are the
moſt ſubſtantial people in the World.
Neither would he allow it to be a good
definition of <hi>accident,</hi> that it could be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0063300200:66"/>
               <hi>preſent or abſent without the deſtruction
of the ſubject</hi>; ſince there are a great
many accidents that deſtroy the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as burning does a houſe, and death
a man. But as to that, Cornelius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him, that there was a <hi>natural
death,</hi> and <hi>a logical death</hi>; that though
a man after his natural death was not
capable of the leaſt pariſh-office, yet
he might ſtill keep his Stall amongſt
the logical praedicaments.</p>
            <p>Cornelius was forc'd to give Martin
ſenſible images; thus calling up the
Coachman he aſk'd him what he had
ſeen at the Bear-garden? the man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
he ſaw two men fight a prize;
one was a fair man, a Sergeant in the
Guards, the other black, a Butcher;
the Sergeant had red breeches, the
Butcher blue; they fought upon a Stage
about four o'clock, and the Sergeant
wounded the Butcher in the leg. <hi>Mark
(quoth Cornelius) how the fellow runs
through the praedicaments. Men,</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia;
<hi>two,</hi> quantitas; <hi>fair and black,</hi>
qualitas; <hi>Sergeant and Butcher,</hi> relatio;
<hi>wounded the other,</hi> actio &amp; paſſio; <hi>fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0063300200:67"/>
ſitus; <hi>Stage,</hi> ubi; <hi>two a Clock,</hi>
quando; <hi>blue and red Breeches,</hi> habitus.
At the ſame time he warn'd Martin,
that what he now <hi>learn'd</hi> as a Logician,
he muſt <hi>forget</hi> as a natural Philoſopher;
that tho' he now taught them that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
inher'd in the ſubject, they
would find in time there was no ſuch
thing; and that colour, taſte, ſmell,
heat, and cold, were not in the things
but only phantaſms of our brains. He
was forc'd to let them into this ſecret,
for Martin could not conceive how a
habit of dancing inher'd in a dancing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
when he did not dance; nay,
he would demand the Characteriſticks
of Relations: Crambe us'd to help him
out by telling him, a Cuckold, a loſing
gameſter, a man that had not din'd, a
young heir that was kept ſhort by his
father, might be all known by their
countenance; that, in this laſt caſe,
the Paternity and Filiation leave very
ſenſible impreſſions in the <hi>relatum</hi> and
<hi>correlatum.</hi> The greateſt difficulty was,
when they came to the Tenth Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament:
Crambe affirmed, that his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0063300200:68"/>
               <hi>Habitus</hi> was more a ſubſtance than he
was; for his cloaths could better ſubſiſt
without him, than he without his
cloaths.</p>
            <p>Martin ſuppos'd an <hi>Univerſal Man</hi>
to be like a Knight of a Shire or a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs
of a Corporation, that repreſented
a great many Individuals. His Father
aſk'd him, if he could not frame the
Idea of an Univerſal Lord Mayor?
Martin told him, that never having ſeen
but one Lord Mayor, the Idea of that
Lord Mayor always return'd to his
mind; that he had great difficulty to
abſtract a Lord Mayor from his Fur,
Gown, and Gold Chain; nay, that the
horſe he ſaw the Lord Mayor ride up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not a little diſturb'd his imagination.
On the other hand Crambe, to ſhow
himſelf of a more penetrating genius,
ſwore that he could frame a conception
of a Lord Mayor not only without his
Horſe, Gown, and Gold Chain, but
even without Stature, Feature, Colour,
Hands, Head, Feet, or any Body;
which he ſuppos'd was the abſtract of
a Lord Mayor. Cornelius told him
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0063300200:69"/>
that he was a lying Raſcal; that an
<hi>Univerſale</hi> was not the object of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and that there was no ſuch
thing in reality, or <hi>a parte Rei.</hi> But I
can prove (quoth Crambe) that there
are <hi>Clyſters a parte Rei,</hi> but <hi>clyſters</hi> are
<hi>univerſales</hi>; <hi>ergo.</hi> Thus I prove my
Minor. <hi>Quod aptum eſt ineſſe multis,</hi>
is an <hi>univerſale</hi> by definition: but every
clyſter before it is adminiſtred has that
quality; therefore every clyſter is an
<hi>univerſale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo found fault with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements,
that they were not ſtrict
logical <hi>definitions:</hi> In an advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Dog ſtol'n or ſtray'd, he ſaid
it ought to begin thus, <hi>An irrational a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal</hi>
of the <hi>Genus caninum,</hi> &amp;c. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
told them, that though thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements
were not fram'd according
to the exact rules of logical definitions,
being only <hi>deſcriptions</hi> of things <hi>numero
differentibus,</hi> yet they contain'd a faint
image of the <hi>praedicabilia,</hi> and were
highly ſubſervient to the common pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of life; often diſcovering things
that were loſt, both animate and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate.

cannot help taking notice of one thing
more extraordinary than any yet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
which was Crambe's <hi>Treatiſe
of Syllogiſms.</hi> He ſuppos'd that a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher's
brain was like a great Foreſt,
where Ideas rang'd like animals of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
kinds; that thoſe Ideas copulated,
and engender'd Concluſions; that
when thoſe of different Species copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
they bring forth monſters or abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities;
that the <hi>Major</hi> is the male, the
<hi>Minor</hi> the female, which copulate by
the Middle Term, and engender the
Concluſion. Hence they are call'd the
<hi>praemiſſa,</hi> or <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;
and it is properly ſaid by Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
<hi>quod pariunt ſcientiam, opinionem,</hi>
they <hi>beget</hi> ſcience, opinion, &amp;c. Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0063300200:71"/>
Propoſitions are Perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and therefore in Logick they are
ſaid to be of the firſt <hi>Figure.</hi> Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Propoſitions are Private perſons, and
therefore plac'd in the third or laſt
figure, or rank. From thoſe principles
all the rules of Syllogiſms naturally
follow.<list>
                  <item>I. That there are only three Terms,
neither more nor leſs; for to a child
there can be only one father and one
mother.</item>
                  <item>II. From univerſal premiſſes there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
an univerſal concluſion, as if
one ſhould ſay that perſons of quality
always beget perſons of quality.</item>
                  <item>III. From ſingular premiſſes follows
only a ſingular concluſion, that is, if
the parents be only private people,
the iſſue muſt be ſo likewiſe.</item>
                  <item>IV. From particular propoſitions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be concluded, becauſe the
<hi>Individua vaga</hi> are (like whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters
and common ſtrumpets)
barren.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0063300200:72"/>
V. There cannot be more in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
than was in the premiſſes,
that is, children can only inherit
from their parents.</item>
                  <item>VI. The concluſion follows the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part, that is, children inherit the
diſeaſes of their parents.</item>
                  <item>VII. From two negatives nothing can
be concluded, for from divorce or
ſeparation there can come no iſſue.</item>
                  <item>VIII. The medium cannot enter the
concluſion, that being logical inceſt.</item>
                  <item>IX. An hypothetical propoſition is only
a contract, or a promiſe of marriage;
from ſuch therefore there can ſpring
no real iſſue.</item>
                  <item>X. When the premiſſes or parents
are neceſſarily join'd (or in lawful
wedlock) they beget lawful iſſue;
but contingently join'd, they beget
baſtards.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the Affirmative propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions;
the Negative muſt be defer'd
to another occaſion.</p>
            <p>Crambe us'd to value himſelf upon
this Syſtem, from whence he ſaid one
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0063300200:73"/>
might ſee the propriety of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>ſuch a one has a barren imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>;
and how common it is for ſuch
people to <hi>adopt</hi> concluſions that are not
the iſſue of their premiſſes? therefore
as an Abſurdity is a <hi>Monſter,</hi> a Falſity
is a <hi>Baſtard</hi>; and a true concluſion that
followeth not from the premiſſes, may
properly be ſaid to be <hi>adopted.</hi> But
then what is an Enthymem? (quoth
Cornelius.) Why, an Enthymem (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
Crambe) is when the Major is
indeed married to the Minor, but the
Marriage <hi>kept ſecret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>METAPHYSICKS were a large field
in which to exerciſe the Weapons <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>
had put into their hands. Here
Martin and Crambe us'd to engage like
any prize fighters, before their Father,
and his other Learned companions of
the Sympoſiacks. And as Prize fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
will agree to lay aſide a buckler or
ſome ſuch defenſive weapon, ſo would
Crambe promiſe not to uſe <hi>ſimpliciter
&amp; ſecundum quid,</hi> provided Martin
would part with <hi>materialiter &amp; forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter:</hi>
But it was found, that without
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0063300200:74"/>
the help of the defenſive armour of
thoſe Diſtinctions, the arguments cut
ſo deep, that they fetch'd blood at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

out of Suarez, Thomas Aquinas, and

                  </item>
               </list> There were ſeveral others of which
in the courſe of the life of this
learned perſon we may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

that remains undecided to this
day; it was taken from the learned
Suarez.<list>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0063300200:76"/>

            <p>This brings into my mind a Project
to baniſh Metaphyſicks out of Spain,
which was ſuppos'd might be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
by this method: That no-body
ſhould uſe any Compound or Decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
of the Subſtantial Verbs but as
they are read in the common conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
for every body will allow, that
if you debar a Metaphyſician from <hi>ens,</hi>
               <hi>eſſentia, entitas, ſubſiſtentia,</hi> &amp;c. there
is an end of him.</p>
            <p>Crambe regretted extremely, that
<hi>Subſtantial Forms,</hi> a race of harmleſs
beings which had laſted for many years,
and afforded a comfortable ſubſiſtance
to many poor Philoſophers, ſhould be
now hunted down like ſo many Wolves,
without the poſſibility of a retreat.
He conſider'd that it had gone much
harder with them than with <hi>Eſſences,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0063300200:77"/>
which had retir'd from the <hi>Schools</hi> into
the <hi>Apothecaries Shops,</hi> where ſome of
them had been advanc'd into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Quinteſſences.</hi> He thought there
ſhould be a retreat for poor <hi>ſubſtantial
Forms,</hi> amongſt the Gentle-uſhers at
court; and that there were indeed <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
forms,</hi> ſuch as <hi>forms of Prayer,</hi>
and <hi>forms of Government,</hi> without which,
the things themſelves could neyer long
ſubſiſt. He alſo us'd to wonder that
there was not a reward for ſuch as could

            <head>ANATOMY.</head>
            <p>COrnelius, it is certain, had a moſt
ſuperſtitious veneration for the
Ancients; and if they contradicted each
other, his Reaſon was ſo pliant and
ductile, that he was always of the
opinion of the laſt he read. But
he reckon'd it a point of honour never
to be vanquiſh'd in a diſpute; from

which quality he acquir'd the title of
the <hi>Invincible Doctor.</hi> While the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
of Anatomy was demonſtrating
to his ſon the ſeveral kinds of <hi>Inteſtines,</hi>
Cornelius affirm'd that there were only
two, the <hi>Colon</hi> and the <hi>Aichos,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Hippocrates, who it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
could ever be miſtaken. It was
in vain to aſſure him this error proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from want of accuracy in dividing
the whole Canal of the Guts: Say
what you pleaſe (he reply'd) this is
both mine and Hippocrates's opinion.
You may with equal reaſon (anſwer'd
the Profeſſor) affirm that a man's Liver
hath five Lobes, and deny the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the blood. Ocular demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(ſaid Cornelius) ſeems to be on
your ſide, yet I ſhall not give it up:
Show me any viſcus of a human body,
and I will bring you a Monſter that
differs from the common rule in the
ſtructure of it. If Nature ſhews ſuch
variety in the ſame age, why may ſhe
not have extended it further in ſeveral
ages? Produce me a man now of the
age of an Antidiluvian; of the ſtrength
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0063300200:79"/>
of Sampſon, or the ſize of the Giants.
If in the whole, why not in parts of
the body, may it not be poſſible the
preſent generation of men may differ
from the Ancients? The Moderns
have perhaps lengthen'd the channel
of the guts by Gluttony, and diminiſh'd
the liver by hard drinking. Though
it ſhall be demonſtrated that modern
blood circulates, yet I will ſtill believe
with Hippocrates, that the blood of
the Ancients had a flux and reflux from
the heart, like a Tide. Conſider how
Luxury hath introduced new diſeaſes,
and with them not improbably alter'd
the whole Courſe of the Fluids. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how the current of mighty Rivers,
nay the very channels of the Ocean are
changed from what they were in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
days; and can we be ſo vain to
imagine, that the Microcoſm of the
human body alone is exempted from
the fate of all things? I queſtion not
but plauſible Conjectures may be made
even as to the Time when the blood
firſt began to circulate.—Such diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
as theſe frequently perplex'd the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0063300200:80"/>
Profeſſor to that degree, that he would
now and then in a paſſion leave him in

this time.</p>
            <p>There unfortunately happen'd ſoon
after, an unuſual accident, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded
the proſecution of the ſtudies of
Martin. Having purchaſed the body
of a Malefactor, he hir'd a Room for
its diſſection near the Peſt-fields in St.
Giles's, at a little diſtance from Tyburn
Road. Crambe (to whoſe care this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was committed) carry'd it thither
about twelve a clock at night in a Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-coach,
few Houſe-keepers being
very willing to let their lodgings to ſuch
kind of Operators. As he was ſoftly
ſtalking up ſtairs in the dark, with the
dead man in his arms, his burthen had
like to have ſlipp'd from him, which
he (to ſave from falling) graſp'd ſo hard
about the belly that it forced the wind
through the <hi>Anus,</hi> with a noiſe exactly
like the <hi>Crepitus</hi> of a living man.
Crambe (who did not comprehend how
this part of the Animal Oeconomy could
remain in a dead man) was ſo terrify'd,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0063300200:81"/>
that he threw down the body, ran up
to his maſter, and had ſcarce breath to
tell him what had happen'd. Martin
with all his Philoſophy could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon him to return to his poſt.
You may ſay what you pleaſe (quoth
Crambe) no man alive ever broke wind
more naturally; nay, he ſeemed to be
mightily relieved by it. The rolling
of the corps down ſtairs made ſuch a
noiſe that it awak'd the whole houſe.
The maid ſhriek'd, the landlady cry'd
out Thieves; but the Landlord, in his
ſhirt as he was, taking a candle in one
hand and a drawn ſword in the other,
ventur'd out of the Room. The maid
with only a ſingle petticoat ran up ſtairs,
but ſpurning at the dead body, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it in a ſwoon. Now the Landlord
ſtood ſtill and liſt'ned, then he look'd
behind him, and ventur'd down in this
manner one ſtair after another, 'till he
came where lay his maid, as dead, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another corps unknown. The wife
ran into the ſtreet and cry'd out Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der!
the Watch ran in, while Martin
and Crambe, hearing all this uproar,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0063300200:82"/>
were coming down ſtairs. The Watch
imagin'd they were making their eſcape,
ſeiz'd them immediately, and carried
them to a neighbouring Juſtice; where,
upon ſearching them, ſeveral kind of
knives and dreadful weapons were found
upon them. The Juſtice firſt examin'd
Crambe. What is your Name? ſays
the Juſtice. I have acquir'd (quoth
Crambe) no great Name as yet; they
call me Crambe or Crambo, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, as to my ſelf; though it
may be ſome diſpute to poſterity.—What
is yours and your Maſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion?<hi>—It is our buſineſs to imbrue
our hands in blood; we cut off the heads,
and pull out the hearts of thoſe that never
injur'd us; we rip up big-belly'd women,
and tear children limb from limb.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
endeavour'd to interrupt him; but
the Juſtice being ſtrangely aſtoniſh'd
with the frankneſs of Crambe's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
order'd him to proceed; upon
which he made the following Speech.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your Worſhip, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the body of this man, I can anſwer
each head that my accuſers alledge againſt</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0063300200:83"/>
               <hi>me, to a hair. They have hitherto talk'd
like num-ſculls without brains; but if
your Worſhip will not only give ear, but
regard me with a favourable eye, I will
not be brow-beaten by the ſupercilious
looks of my adverſaries, who now ſtand
cheek by jowl by your Worſhip. I will
prove to their faces, that their foul mouths
have not open'd their lips without a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;
though they have ſhewed their teeth
as if they would bite off my noſe. Now,
Sir, that I may fairly ſlip my Neck out
of the collar, I beg this matter may not
be ſlightly ſkin'd over. Tho' I have no
man here to back me, I will un-boſom
my ſelf, ſince Truth is on my ſide, and
ſhall give them their bellies full, though
they think they have me upon the hip.
Whereas they ſay I came into their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with arms, and murder'd this man
without their Privity, I declare I had
not the leaſt Finger in it; and ſince
I am to ſtand upon my own legs, nothing
of this matter ſhall be left till I ſet it
upon a right foot. In the vein I am in,
I cannot for my heart's blood and guts
bear this uſage: I ſhall not ſpare my</hi>

I have the bowels of compaſſion. I aſk

Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Juſtice ſtared, the Landlord and
Landlady lifted up their eyes, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
fretted, while Crambe talk'd in this
rambling incoherent manner; till at
length Martin begg'd to be heard. It
was with great difficulty that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
was convinc'd, till they ſent for
the Finiſher of human laws, of whom
the Corps had been purchas'd; who
looking near the left ear, knew his own
work, and gave Oath accordingly.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was Martin got home,
but he fell into a paſſion at Crambe.

Crambe) this is your Day for <hi>Uns.</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0063300200:86"/>
Martin could bear no longer—however
compoſing his Countenance, Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—he cry'd, there are five pounds,
ſeventeen ſhillings and nine pence: thou
haſt been with me eight months, three
weeks, two days, and four hours. Poor
Crambe upon the receipt of his Salary,
fell into tears, flung the money upon

words: <hi>O Cicero, Cicero! if to pun be
a crime, 'tis a crime I have learned from
thee: O Bias, Bias! if to pun be a

Whereupon Martin, (conſidering that

            <p>To this purpoſe he directed, in the

He conſider'd <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi>
as certain Habits which proceed from
the natural Formation and Structure of
particular parts of the body. A Bird
flies becauſe it has Wings, a Duck
ſwims becauſe it is web-footed: and
there can be no queſtion but the Adun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the pounces, and beaks of the
Hawks, as well as the length of the
fangs, the ſharpneſs of the teeth, and
the ſtrength of the crural and Maſſeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſcles

               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0063300200:91"/>
Iſt, He obſerv'd that the Soul and
Body mutually operate upon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore if you deprive the
Mind of the outward Inſtruments
whereby ſhe uſually expreſſeth that
Paſſion, you will in time abate the
Paſſion itſelf, in like manner as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
abates Luſt.</p>
            <p>2dly, That the Soul in mankind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
every Paſſion by the Motion of
ſome particular <hi>Muſcles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3dly, That all Muſcles grow ſtronger
and thicker by being <hi>much us'd</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the habitual Paſſions may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in particular perſons by the
<hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>bigneſs</hi> of the Muſcles us'd
in the expreſſion of that Paſſion.</p>
            <p>4thly, That a Muſcle may be
ſtrengthen'd or weakn'd by weakning
or ſtrength'ning the force of its Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt.
Theſe things premis'd, he
took notice,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Complaiſance, humility, aſſent,</hi>
               <hi>approbation,</hi> and <hi>civility,</hi> were expreſs'd
by nodding the head and bowing the
body forward: on the contrary, <hi>diſſent,</hi>
               <hi>diſlike, refuſal, pride,</hi> and <hi>arrogance,</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0063300200:92"/>
were mark'd by toſſing the head, and
bending the body backwards: which
two Paſſions of <hi>aſſent,</hi> and <hi>diſſent</hi> the
Latins rightly expreſs'd by the words
<hi>adnuere</hi> and <hi>abnuere.</hi> Now he obſerv'd
that complaiſant and civil people had
the Flexors of the head very ſtrong;
but in the proud and inſolent there was
a great over-balance of ſtrength in the
Extenſors of the Neck and the Muſcles
of the Back, from whence they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
with great facility the motion of
<hi>toſſing,</hi> but with great difficulty that of
<hi>bowing,</hi> and therefore have juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
the Title of <hi>ſtiff-neck'd:</hi> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to reduce ſuch perſons to a juſt
balance, he judg'd that the pair of
Muſcles call'd <hi>Recti interni,</hi> the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toidal,
with other flexors of the head,
neck, and body muſt be ſtrengthen'd;
their Antagoniſts, the <hi>Splenii Complexi,</hi>
and the Extenſors of the Spine, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd;
For which purpoſe Nature her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſeems to have directed mankind to
correct this Muſcular Immorality by
tying ſuch fellows <hi>Neck-and-heels.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0063300200:93"/>
Contrary to this, is the pernicious
Cuſtom of Mothers who aboliſh the
natural Signature of Modeſty in their
Daughters by teaching them <hi>toſſing</hi> and
<hi>bridling,</hi> rather than the baſhful poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>ſtooping,</hi> and <hi>hanging down the
head.</hi> Martinus charg'd all huſbands
to take notice of the <hi>Poſture of the
Head</hi> of ſuch as they courted to Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
as that upon which their future
happineſs did much depend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flatterers,</hi> who have the flexor Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
ſo ſtrong that they are always bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and cringing, he ſuppos'd might in
ſome meaſure be corrected by being
ty'd down upon a Tree by the back,
like the children of the Indians; which
doctrine was ſtrongly confirm'd by his
obſerving the ſtrength of the <hi>levatores
Scapulae:</hi> This Muſcle is call'd the
Muſcle of <hi>patience,</hi> becauſe in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Mind people ſhrug and raiſe
up the ſhoulder to the tip of the ear.
This Muſcle alſo he obſerved to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
ſtrong and large in <hi>Henpeck'd
Huſbands,</hi> in <hi>Italians,</hi> and in <hi>Engliſh
Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0063300200:94"/>
In purſuance of his Theory, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
the <hi>Conſtrictors</hi> of the <hi>Eye-lids,</hi>
muſt be ſtrengthen'd in the ſupercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the <hi>abductors</hi> in drunkards and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
men, who have the ſame
ſteddy and grave motion of the eye.
That the <hi>buccinatores</hi> or blowers up of
the <hi>cheeks,</hi> and the <hi>dilators</hi> of the <hi>Noſe,</hi>
were too ſtrong in Cholerick people;
and therefore Nature here again direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us to a remedy, which was to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
ſuch extraordinary dilatation by
<hi>pulling by the Noſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rolling amorous Eye, in the
Paſſion of Love, might be corrected by
frequently looking thro' glaſſes. Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
fellows that jump upon Tables,
and cut capers, might be cur'd by relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
medicines apply'd to the <hi>Calves</hi> of
their <hi>legs,</hi> which in ſuch people are too
ſtrong.</p>
            <p>But there were two Caſes which he
reckon'd extremely difficult. Firſt,
<hi>Affectation,</hi> in which there were ſo
many Muſcles of the bum, thighs, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
neck, back, and the whole body, all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0063300200:95"/>
in a falſe tone, that it requir'd an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
multiplicity of applications.</p>
            <p>The ſecond caſe was immoderate
<hi>Laughter:</hi> When any of that riſible
ſpecies were brought to the Doctor, and
when he conſider'd what an infinity of
Muſcles theſe laughing Raſcals threw
into a convulſive motion at the ſame
time; whether we regard the ſpaſms
of the Diaphragm and all the muſcles
of reſpiration, the horrible <hi>rictus</hi> of the
mouth, the diſtortion of the lower jaw,
the criſping of the noſe, twinkling of
the eyes, or ſphaerical convexity of the
cheeks, with the tremulous ſuccuſſion
of the whole human body: when he
conſider'd, I ſay, all this, he uſed to cry

            <head>The Caſe of a young Nobleman at Court,
with the Doctor's Preſcription for
the ſame.</head>
            <p>AN eminent Inſtance of Martinus's
Sagacity in diſcovering the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers
of the Mind, appear'd in the
caſe of a young Nobleman at Court,
who was obſerv'd to grow extremely
affected in his ſpeech, and whimſical in
all his behaviour. He began to aſk
odd queſtions, talk in verſe to himſelf,
ſhut himſelf up from his friends, and be
acceſſible to none, but Flatterers, Poets,
and Pickpockets; till his Relations and
old Acquaintance judged him to be ſo
far gone, as to be a fit Patient for the
Doctor.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had heard and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all the ſymptoms, he pronounced
his diſtemper to be <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His friends aſſured him that they had
with great care obſerv'd all his motions,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0063300200:97"/>
and were perfectly ſatisfy'd there was
no Woman in the caſe. Scriblerus
was as poſitive that he was deſperately
in love with ſome perſon or other.
<hi>How can that be? (ſaid his Aunt, who
came to aſk the advice) when he converſes
almoſt with none but himſelf?</hi> Say you
ſo? he replied, why then he is in love
with Himſelf, one of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
caſes in the world. I am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
people do not enough attend this
Diſeaſe, which has the ſame cauſes and
ſymptoms, and admits of the ſame cure,
with the other: eſpecially ſince here
the caſe of the Patient is the more help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and deplorable of the two, as this
unfortunate paſſion is more blind than
the other. There are people who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
from their very youth a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
inclination to themſelves;
which is unhappily nurs'd by ſuch
Mothers, as with their good will, wou'd
never ſuffer their children to be <hi>croſs'd
in love.</hi> Eaſe, luxury, and idleneſs,
blow up this flame as well as the other:
Conſtant opportunities of converſation
with the perſon beloved, (the greateſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0063300200:98"/>
of incentives) are here impoſſible to be
prevented. Bawds and Pimps in the
other love, will be perpetually doing
kind offices, ſpeaking a good word for
the party, and carry about Billet doux.
Therefore I aſk you, Madam, if this
Gentleman has not been much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Flatterers, and a ſort of people
who bring him dedications and verſes?
<hi>O Lord! Sir, (quoth the Aunt) the
houſe is haunted with them.</hi> There it
is, (reply'd Scriblerus) thoſe are the
bawds and pimps that go between a
man and himſelf. Are there no civil
Ladies, that tell him he dreſſes well,
has a gentlemanly air, and the like?
<hi>Why truly Sir, my Nephew is not auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>—Look you Madam, this is
a misfortune to him: In former days
theſe ſort of lovers were happy in one
reſpect, that they never had any Rivals,
but of late they have all the Ladies ſo—Be pleaſed to anſwer a few queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
more. Whom does he generally
talk of? Himſelf, quoth the Aunt.
Whoſe wit and breeding does he moſt
commend? His own, quoth the Aunt.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0063300200:99"/>
Whom does he write letters to? Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Whom does he dream of? All
the dreams I ever heard were of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Whom is he ogling yonder?
Himſelf in his looking-glaſs. Why
does he throw back his head in that
languiſhing poſture? Only to be bleſt
with a ſmile of himſelf as he paſſes by,
Does he ever ſteal a kiſs from himſelf,
by biting his lips? <hi>Oh continually, till
they are perfect vermilion.</hi> Have you
obſerv'd him to uſe Familiarities with
any body? <hi>With none but himſelf: he
often embraces himſelf with folded arms,
he claps his hand often upon his hip, nay
ſometimes thruſts it into—his breaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid the Doctor, all theſe
are ſtrong ſymptoms, but there remain
a few more. Has this amorous gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
preſented himſelf with any Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toys;
ſuch as gold Snuff-boxes, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Watches, or Tweezer-caſes? thoſe
are things that in time will ſoften the
moſt obdurate heart. <hi>Not only ſo, (ſaid
the Aunt) but he bought the other day a
very fine brilliant diamond Ring for his
own wearing.—</hi>Nay, if he has accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0063300200:100"/>
of this Ring, the intrigue is very
forward indeed, and it is high time for
friends to interpoſe. Pray Madam, a
word or two more—Is he jealous that
his acquaintance do not behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with reſpect enough? will he
bear jokes and innocent freedoms?
<hi>By no means; a familiar appellation
makes him angry; if you ſhake him a
little roughly by the hand, he is in a rage;
but if you chuck him under the chin he
will return you a box on the ear.</hi>—Then
the caſe is plain: he has the true
Pathognomick ſign of Love, <hi>Jealouſly</hi>;
for no body will ſuffer his miſtreſs to
be treated at that rate. Madam, upon
the whole this Caſe is extreamly dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
There are ſome people who are
far gone in this paſſion of ſelf-love, but
then they keep a <hi>very ſecret Intrigue</hi>
with themſelves, and hide it from all
the world beſides. But this Patient
has not the leaſt care of the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Beloved, he is downright ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
in his behaviour with himſelf;
he is enchanted, bewitch'd, and almoſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0063300200:101"/>
paſt cure. However let the following
methods be try'd upon him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let him *** <hi>Hiatus.</hi> ***
Secondly, let him wear a Bob-wig.
Thirdly, ſhun the Company of flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
nay of ceremonious people, and of
all Frenchmen in general. It would
not be a miſs if he travel'd over Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
in a Stage-coach, and made the
Tour of Holland in a Track-ſcoute.
Let him return the Snuff-boxes, Twee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer-caſes,
(and particularly the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
Ring) which he has receiv'd
from himſelf. Let ſome knowing
friend repreſent to him the many vile
Qualities of this Miſtreſs of his: let
him be ſhewn that her Extravagance,
Pride, and Prodigality will infallibly
bring him to a morſel of bread: Let it
be prov'd, that he has been Falſe to
himſelf, and if Treachery is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
cauſe to diſcard a Miſtreſs, what
is? In ſhort let him be made to ſee
that no mortal beſides himſelf either
loves or can ſuffer this Creature. Let
all Looking-glaſſes, poliſh'd Toys, and
even clean Plates beremoved from him,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0063300200:102"/>
for fear of bringing back the admired
object. Let him be taught to put off
all thoſe tender airs, affected ſmiles,
languiſhing looks, wanton toſſes of the
head, coy motions of the body, that
mincing gait, ſoft tone of voice, and all
that enchanting woman-like behaviour,
that has made him the charm of his
own eyes, and the object of his own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration.
Let him ſurprize the Beauty
he adores at a diſadvantage, ſurvey him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
naked, diveſted of artificial charms,
and he will find himſelf a forked ſtrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Animal, with bandy legs, a ſhort
neck, a dun hide, and a pot-belly. It
would be yet better if he took a ſtrong
purge once a week, in order to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
himſelf in that condition: at
which time it will be convenient to
make uſe of the Letters, Dedications,
&amp;c. aboveſaid. Something like this
has been obſerv'd by Lucretius and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be a powerful remedy in the
caſe of Women. If all this will not
do, I muſt e'en leave the poor man to
his deſtiny. Let him <hi>marry himſelf,</hi>
and when he is condemn'd eternally to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0063300200:103"/>
himſelf, perhaps he may run to the
next pond to get rid of himſelf, the
Fate of moſt violent Self-lovers.</p>

            <head>How <hi>Martinus</hi> endeavoured to find out
the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and of his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with the <hi>Free-Thinkers.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN this Deſign of Martin to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Diſeaſes of the Mind, he
thought nothing ſo neceſſary as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi>; in
which at firſt he labour'd under great
uncertainties. Sometimes he was of
opinion that it lodg'd in the Brain,
ſometimes in the Stomach, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Heart. Afterwards he
thought it abſurd to confine that ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Lady to one apartment, which
made him infer that ſhe ſhifted it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſeveral functions of life:
The Brain was her Study, the Heart
her State-room, and the Stomach her
Kitchen. But as he ſaw ſeveral Offices
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0063300200:104"/>
of life went on at the ſame time, he
was forc'd to give up this Hypotheſis
alſo. He now conjectured it was more
for the dignity of the Soul to perform
ſeveral operations by her little Miniſters,
the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> from whence it was
natural to conclude, that ſhe reſides in
different parts according to different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
Sexes, Ages, and Profeſſions.
Thus in Epicures he ſeated her in the
mouth of the Stomach, Philoſophers
have her in the Brain, Soldiers in their
Heart, Women in their Tongues, Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in their Fingers, and Rope-dancers
in their Toes. At length he grew fond
of the <hi>Glandula Pinealis,</hi> diſſecting
many Subjects to find out the different
Figure of this Gland, from whence he
might diſcover the cauſe of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Tempers in mankind. He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
that in factious and reſtleſs-ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people he ſhould find it ſharp and
pointed, allowing no room for the Soul
to repoſe herſelf; that in quiet Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
it was flat, ſmooth, and ſoft, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
to the Soul as it were an eaſy
cuſhion. He was confirm'd in this by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0063300200:105"/>
obſerving, that Calves and Philoſophers,
Tygers and Stateſmen, Foxes and Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
Peacocks and Fops, Cock-Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and Coquets, Monkeys and Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Courtiers and Spaniels, Moles and
Miſers, exactly reſemble one another
in the conformation of the <hi>Pineal
Gland.</hi> He did not doubt likewiſe to
find the ſame reſemblance in Highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Conquerors: In order to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
himſelf in which, it was, that
he purchaſed the body of one of the
firſt Species (as hath been before rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
at Tyburn, hoping in time to have
the happineſs of one of the latter too,
under his Anatomical knife.</p>
            <p>We muſt not omit taking notice here
that theſe Enquiries into the <hi>Seat</hi> of
the <hi>Soul</hi> gave occaſion to his firſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with the ſociety of <hi>Free-Thinkers,</hi>
who were then in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in England, and ſo much taken with
the promiſing endowments of Martin,
that they order'd their Secretary to
write him the following Letter.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                  <head>To the learned Inquiſitor into Nature,
MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS: The
Society of <hi>Free-Thinkers</hi> greeting.</head>

                  </opener>
                  <p>IT is with unſpeakable joy we have
heard of your Inquiſitive Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
and we think it great pity that it
ſhould not be better employed, than in
looking after that Theological Non-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
commonly call'd the <hi>Soul:</hi> Since
after all your enquiries, it will appear
you have loſt your labour in ſeeking
the Reſidence of ſuch a Chimera, that
never had being but in the brains of
ſome dreaming Philoſophers. Is it not
<hi>Demonſtration</hi> to a perſon of your Senſe,
that ſince <hi>you cannot find it,</hi> there is <hi>no
ſuch thing?</hi> In order to ſet ſo hopeful
a Genius right in this matter, we have
ſent you an anſwer to the ill-grounded
Sophiſms of thoſe crack-brain'd fellows,
and likewiſe an eaſy <hi>mechanical Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of <hi>Perception</hi> or <hi>Thinking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of their chief Arguments is,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0063300200:107"/>
that <hi>Self-conſciouſneſs</hi> cannot inhere in
any ſyſtem of Matter, becauſe all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is made up of ſeveral diſtinct beings,
which never can make up one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
thinking being.</p>
                  <p>This is eaſily anſwer'd by a familiar
inſtance. In every <hi>Jack</hi> there is a <hi>meat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaſting</hi>
Quality, which neither reſides
in the Fly, nor in the Weight, nor in
any particular wheel of the Jack, but
is the reſult of the whole compoſition:
So in an Animal, the Self-conſciouſneſs
is not a real Quality inherent in one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(any more than meat-roaſting in
a Jack) but the reſult of ſeveral Modes
or qualities in the ſame ſubject. As
the fly, the wheels, the chain, the
weight, the cords, &amp;c. make one Jack,
ſo the ſeveral parts of the body make
one Animal. As perception or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
is ſaid to be inherent in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal,
ſo is meat-roaſting ſaid to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in the Jack. As ſenſation, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
volition, memory, &amp;c. are the
ſeveral Modes of thinking; ſo roaſting
of beef, roaſting of mutton, roaſting
of pullets, geeſe, turkeys, &amp;c. are the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0063300200:108"/>
ſeveral modes of meat-roaſting. And
as the general Quality of meat-roaſting,
with its ſeveral modifications as to beef,
mutton, pullets, &amp;c. does not inhere
in any one part of the Jack; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does conſciouſneſs, with its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
modes of ſenſation, intellection,
volition, &amp;c. inhere in any one, but is
the reſult from the mechanical compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the whole Animal.</p>
                  <p>Juſt ſo, the Quality or diſpoſition in
a Fiddle to play tunes, with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
modifications of this <hi>tune-playing</hi>
quality in playing of Preludes, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
Jigs, and Gavotts, are as much
real qualities in the Inſtrument, as the
thought or the imagination is in the
mind of the Perſon that compoſes them.</p>
                  <p>The Parts (ſay they) of an animal
body are perpetually chang'd, and the
fluids which ſeem to be ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs,
are in a perpetual circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſo that the ſame individual parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
do not remain in the Brain; from
whence it will follow, that the idea of
Individual Conſciouſneſs muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
tranſlated from one particle of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0063300200:109"/>
matter to another, whereby the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
A, for example, muſt not only be
conſcious, but conſcious that it is the
ſame being with the particle B that
went before.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, this is only a fallacy of
the imagination, and is to be underſtood
in no other ſenſe than that maxim of
the Engliſh Law, that the <hi>King never
dies.</hi> This power of thinking, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving,
and governing the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
is communicated from every
Particle to its immediate Succeſſor;
who, as ſoon as he is gone, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
takes upon him the Government,
which ſtill preſerves the Unity of the
whole Syſtem.</p>
                  <p>They make a great noiſe about this
Individuality: how a man is conſcious
to himſelf that he is the ſame Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
he was twenty years ago; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the flux ſtate of the Particles
of matter that compoſe his body. We
think this is capable of a very plain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and may be eaſily illuſtrated by a
familiar example.</p>
                  <p>Sir John Cutler had a pair of black
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0063300200:110"/>
worſted ſtockings, which his maid darn'd
ſo often with ſilk, that they became
at laſt a pair of ſilk, ſtockings. Now
ſuppoſing thoſe ſtockings of Sir John's
endued with ſome degree of Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
at every particular darning, they
would have been ſenſible, that they
were the ſame individual pair of ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
both before and after the darning;
and this ſenſation would have continued
in them through all the ſucceſſion of
darnings; and yet after the laſt of all,
there was not perhaps one thread left
of the firſt pair of ſtockings, but they
were grown to be ſilk ſtockings, as was
ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is affirm'd, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
animal is conſcious of ſome indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
ſelf-moving, ſelf-determining prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
it is anſwer'd, that as in a Houſe
of Commons all things are determin'd
by a <hi>Majority,</hi> ſo it is in every Animal
ſyſtem. As that which determines the
Houſe is ſaid to be the reaſon of the
whole aſſembly; it is no otherwiſe with
thinking Beings, who are determin'd
by the greater force of ſeveral particles;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0063300200:111"/>
which, like ſo many unthinking Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
compoſe one thinking Syſtem.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is likewiſe objected,
that Puniſhments cannot be juſt that
are not inflicted upon the ſame indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,
which cannot ſubſiſt without the
notion of a ſpiritual ſubſtance. We
reply, that this is no greater difficulty
to conceive, than that a Corporation,
which is likewiſe a flux body, may be
puniſhed for the faults, and liable to
the debts, of their Predeceſſors.</p>
                  <p>We proceed now to explain, by the
ſtructure of the Brain, the ſeveral
Modes of thinking. It is well known
to Anatomiſts that the Brain is a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries</hi>
of Glands, that ſeparate the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
parts of the blood, call'd Animal
Spirits; that a Gland is nothing but a
canal of a great length, variouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
and wound up together. From
the Arietadion and Motion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in thoſe Canals, proceed all the
different ſorts of Thoughts: Simple I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
are produced by the motion of the
Spirits in one ſimple Canal: when two
of theſe Canals diſembogue themſelves
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0063300200:112"/>
into one, they make what we call a
Propoſition; and when two of theſe
propoſitional Chanels empty themſelves
into a third, they form a Syllogiſm, or
a Ratiocination. Memory is perform'd
in a diſtinct apartment of the brain,
made up of veſſels ſimilar, and like ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
to the ideal, propoſitional, and
ſyllogiſtical veſſels, in the primary parts
of the brain. After the ſame manner
it is eaſy to explain the other modes of
thinking; as alſo why ſome people
think ſo wrong and perverſely, which
proceeds from the bad configuration of
thoſe Glands. Some for example, are
born without the propoſitional or ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſtical
Canals; in others that reaſon
ill, they are of unequal capacities; in
dull fellows, of too great a length,
whereby the motion of the ſpirits is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded;
in trifling genius's, weak and
ſmall: in the over-refining ſpirits, too
much intorted and winding; and ſo of
the reſt.</p>
                  <p>We are ſo much perſuaded of the
truth of this our Hypotheſis, that we
have employ'd one of our Members, a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0063300200:113"/>
great Virtuoſo at Nuremberg, to make
a ſort of an Hydraulick Engine, in
which a chimical liquor reſembling
Blood, is driven through Elaſtick cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
reſembling Arteries and veins, by
the force of an Embolus like the heart,
and wrought by a pneumatick Machine
of the nature of the lungs, with ropes
and pullies, like the nerves, tendons and
muſcles: And we are perſwaded that
this our artificial Man will not only
walk, and ſpeak, and perform moſt of
the outward actions of the animal life,
but (being wound up once a week)
will perhaps reaſon as well as moſt of
your Country Parſons.</p>
                  <p>We wait with the utmoſt impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for the honour of having you a
Member of our Society, and beg leave
to aſſure you that we are, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>What return Martin made to this

occaſion: let it ſuffice at preſent

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0063300200:114"/>
doing him the honour ſo much as
to mention him. He advis'd his

ſufficient ſecurity, to bear him harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
from any thing that might happen
after this preſent life.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> The ſtyle of this Chapter in the
<hi>Original Memoirs</hi> is ſo ſingularly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the reſt, that it is hard to
conceive by whom it was penn'd. But
if we conſider the particular Regard
which our Philoſopher had for it,
who expreſly directed that <hi>not one
Word of this Chapter ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,</hi>
it will be natural to ſuſpect that
it was written by himſelf, at the Time
when <hi>Love</hi> (ever delighting in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi>)
had ſomewhat tinctur'd his
Style; and that the Remains of his
firſt and ſrongeſt Paſſion gave him a
Partiality to this Memorial of it.
Thus it begins.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUT now the ſucceſsful Courſe of
the Studies of Martin was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by <hi>Love:</hi> Love, that unnerves
the Vigour of the Hero, and ſoftens
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0063300200:116"/>
the Severity of the Philoſopher. It
chanced, that as Martin was walking
forth to inhale the freſh breeze of the
Evening, after the long and ſevere
Studies of the day, and paſſing through
the Weſtern Confines of the famous
Metropolis of Albion, not far from the
proud Battlements of the Palace of
Whitehall, whoſe walls are embraced
by the ſilver Thames; his eyes were
drawn upwards by a large ſquare piece
of Canvas, which hung forth to the view
of the paſſing Citizens. Upon it was
pourtrayed by ſome accurate pencil, the
Lybian Leopard more fierce than in his
native Deſart; the mighty Lion, who
boaſted thrice the bulk of the Nemaean
monſter; before whom ſtood the little
Jackall, the faithful ſpy of the King of
beaſts: Near theſe was placed, of two
Cubits high, the black Prince of Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motapa;
by whoſe ſide were ſeen the
glaring Cat-a-mountain, the quill-dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Porcupine, and the Man-mimick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Manteger. Cloſe adjoining to this,
hung another piece of Canvas on which
was diſplay'd the pourtrait of two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0063300200:117"/>
Damſels, whom Nature had as
cloſely united as the ancient Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus
and Salmacis; and whom it
was as impoſſible to divide, as the
mingled waters of the gentle Thames
and the amorous Iſis. While Martin
ſtood in a meditating poſture, feaſting
his eyes on this Picture, he heard on a
ſudden the ſonorous notes of a Clarion,
which ſeem'd of the pureſt cryſtal: In
an inſtant the paſſing multitude flock'd
to the ſound, as when a Drum ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
the ſtraggling ſoldiers to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Battle. The youthful Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo,
who was in daily purſuit of the
Curioſities of Nature, was immediately
ſurrounded by the gazing throng. The
doors, for ever barr'd to the pennyleſs
populace, ſeem'd to open themſelves at
his producing a ſilver Six-pence, which
(like Aeneas's golden bough) gain'd
him admiſſion into that Scene of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
He no ſooner enter'd the firſt
apartment, but his noſtrils were ſtruck
with the ſcent of Carnage; broken
Bones and naked Carcaſſes beſtrow'd
the floor. The majeſtick Lion rouz'd
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0063300200:118"/>
from his bed, and ſhook his brindled
Mane; the ſpotted Leopard gnaſh'd
his angry teeth, and walking to and fro,
in indignation rattled his chains. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
with infinite pleaſure heard the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the ſeveral Monſters, which
was courteouſly open'd to him by a
Perſon of a grave and earneſt mien;
whoſe frank behaviour and ready an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
diſcover'd him to have been long
converſant with different Nations, and
to have journey'd through diſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
By him he was informed, that
the Lion was hunted on the hills of
Lebanon, by the Baſha of Jeruſalem;
that the Leopard was nurs'd in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited
woods of Lybia; the Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
came from the kingdom of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-John,
and the Manteger was a true
deſcendant of the celebrated Hanniman
the Magnificent. Sir, ſaid Mr. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
(for that was the name of the
Maſter of the Show) the whole World
cannot match theſe prodigies: twice
have I ſail'd round the Globe; theſe
feet have travers'd the moſt remote and
barbarous nations; and I can with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0063300200:119"/>
conſcience affirm, that not all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts
of the four Quarters of the Earth
furniſh out a more compleat ſett of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
than what are contain'd within
theſe walls. Friend, (anſwer'd Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin)
bold is thy Aſſertion, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is the knowledge of a Traveller.
But did'ſt thou ever riſque thy ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <note n="*" place="bottom">Pliny lib. 7. cap. 2.</note>Scythian Canibals, or thoſe
wild men of Abarimon, who walk
with their feet backwards? haſt thou
ever ſeen the Sciopi, ſo called becauſe
when laid ſupine, they ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Sun-beams with the
ſhadow of their feet? canſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
me a Troglodyte footman, who
can catch a Roe at his full ſpeed? haſt
thou ever beheld thoſe Illyrian damſels
who have two ſights in one eye, whoſe
looks are poiſonous to males that are
adult? haſt thou ever meaſur'd the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantick
Ethiopian, whoſe ſtature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
eight cubits high, or the ſeſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedalian
Pigmey? haſt thou ever ſeen
any of the Cynocephali, who have the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0063300200:120"/>
head and voice of a Dog, and whoſe

all theſe have I beheld, upon my
honour, and many more which are ſet

men, they are no other than what
ſtands before you; that is naturally the
fierceſt, but by art the tameſt Mante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

Martin) is a corruption of the <note n="†" place="bottom">Aelian. lib. 4. cap. 2. Pliny lib. 11. cap 51. Pliny lib. 8. cap. 30. lib. 8. cap. 25. Aelian lib. 3. cap. 42. Aelian. lib. 1. cap. 49. Aelian. lib 1. cap. 2.</note>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichora
of the Ancients, the moſt nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
Animal that ever infeſted the earth;
who had a Sting above a cubit long,
and would attack a rank of armed men
at once, flinging his poiſonous darts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
miles around him. Canſt thou
inform me whether the Boars grunt in
Macedonia? Canſt thou give me a
Certificate that the Lions in Africa
are afraid of the ſcolding of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?
haſt thou ever heard the ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Hyaena counterfeit the voice of a
ſhepherd, imitate the vomiting of a

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0063300200:121"/>
man to draw the dogs together, and
ev'n call a ſhepherd by his proper name?
Your Crocodile is but a ſmall one, but
you ought to have brought with him
the bird Trochilos that picks his teeth
after dinner, at which the ſilly animal
is ſo pleaſed, that he gapes wide enough
to give the Ichneumon, his mortal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
an entrance into his belly.
Your modern Oſtriches are dwindled to
meer Larks in compariſon with thoſe
of the Ancients; theirs were equal in
ſtature to a man on horſeback. Alas!
we have loſt the chaſte bird Porphyrion!
the whole Race was deſtroy'd by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
becauſe they diſcover'd the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of wives to their huſbands. The
Merops too is now no where to be found,
the only bird that flew backward by
the tail. But ſay, canſt thou inform
me, what Dialect of the Greek is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the birds of Diomedes'iſland?
for it is from them only we can learn
the true pronunciation of that ancient
language.—Mr. Randal made no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
anſwer to theſe demands, but
harangued chiefly upon modern Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0063300200:122"/>
and ſeem'd willing to confine his
inſtances to the Animals of his own col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
pointing to each of them in
order with his Rod.</p>
            <p>After Martin had ſatisfy'd his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
here, he was conducted into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apartment. Juſt at the entrance
of the door appear'd a Negroe Prince.
His habiliments beſpoke him royal;
his head was crown'd with the feather
of an Oſtrich, his ſable feet and legs
were interlaced with Purple and Gold,
ſpangled with the Diamonds of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,
and the precious ſtones of Briſtol.
Though his ſtature was of the loweſt,
yet he behav'd himſelf with ſuch an
Air of Grandeur, as gave evident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of his Regal Birth and Education.
He was mounted upon the leſt Palfrey
in the Univerſe; a Palfrey whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Beauty ſtood not in need of thoſe
various colour'd Ribbons which braided
his Mane, and were interwoven with
his Tail. Again the chryſtal Clarion
founded, and after ſeveral courteous
ſpeeches between the black Prince and
Martin, our youthful Philoſopher
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0063300200:123"/>
walk'd into the midſt of the room, to
bleſs his ſight with the moſt beautiful
Curioſity of Nature. On a ſudden en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
at another door the two Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Siſters, whoſe common parts of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
had ſo cloſely ally'd them,
that Nature ſeem'd here to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
with Fortune, that their lives
ſhould run in an eternal Parallel.</p>
            <p>The Sun had twice eight times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
his annual courſe, ſince their
Mother brought them into the world
with double pangs. Lindamira's eyes
were of a lively blue; Indamora's were
black and piercing. Lindamira's cheeks
might rival the bluſh of the morning;
in Indamora the Lilly overcame the
Roſe. Lindamira's treſſes were of the
paler Gold, while the locks of Inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora
were black and gloſſy as the
Plumes of a Raven.</p>
            <p>How great is the power of Love in
human breaſts! In vain has the Wiſe
man recourſe to his Reaſon, when the
inſinuating Arrow touches his heart,
and the pleaſing poiſon is diffuſed
through his veins. But then how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0063300200:124"/>
how tranſporting muſt that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
prove, where not only the Fire of
Youth, but the unquenchable Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Philoſopher, pitch'd upon the
ſame object! For how much ſoever
our Martin was enamour'd on her as a
beautiful Woman, he was infinitely
more raviſh'd with her as a charming
Monſter. What wonder then, if his
gentle Spirit, already humaniz'd by a
polite Education to receive all ſoft im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
and fired by the ſight of
thoſe beauties ſo laviſhly expos'd to his
view, ſhould prove unable to reſiſt at
once ſo pleaſing a Paſſion, and ſo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Phaenomenon?</p>
            <p>Martin, who felt the true emotions
of Love, bluſh'd that the Object of
his flame ſhould be ſo openly proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to vulgar eyes. And though he
had been permitted to peruſe her moſt
ſecret charms, yet his honourable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was ſo ſtrong, that it ran into the
extreme of baſhfulneſs; ſo that at the
firſt interview he made no Overtures of
his Love. Penſive he return'd, and
flinging himſelf on his Couch, paſs'd
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0063300200:125"/>
away the tedious hours of the night in
the utmoſt Inquietude. The ruſhy
Taper afforded a glimm'ring light, by
which he contemplated the tender lines
of Ovid; but alas! his Remedy of Love
was no cure for our unhappy Lover's
Anxiety! He cloſed the amorous vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
ſigh'd, and caſting his eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
on the Books that adorned his
room, broke forth in this pathetic Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe.</p>
            <p>O ye Spirits of Antiquity, who yet
live in thoſe ſacred leaves! why do I
make you conſcious of my ſhame? Yet
why ſhould I depreciate the noble Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Love, and call it Shame? your
Heroes have felt it, your Poets and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
have prais'd it. Were I ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
on ſome gaudy Virgin, did I
doat on vulgar Perfection, the Luſtre
of an Eye, or the Roſe of a Cheek;
with reaſon might I bluſh before you,
moſt learned Inquiſitors into Nature!
moſt reverend Pliny, Aelian, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus!
Yet ſure you cannot diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of this, which is no wanton Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but excited by ſo unparallel'd a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0063300200:126"/>
Production; a flame, that may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
juſtify itſelf to the Severity of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
but even to the Avarice of a
Parent; ſince ſhe who cauſes it carries
a moſt plentiful Fortune in the ſole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of her perſon. Heavens!
how I wonder at the Stupidity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who can affix the opprobrious
Name of Monſtroſity to what is only
Variety of Beauty, and a Profuſion of
generous Nature? If there are charms
in one face, one mouth, one body; if
there are charms in two eyes, two
breaſts, two arms; are they not all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
in the Object of my Paſſion?
What tho'ſhe be the common Gaze of
the multitude, and is follow'd about by
the ſtupid and ignorant; does ſhe not
herein reſemble the greateſt Princes,
and the greateſt Beauties? only with
this difference, that her Admirers are
more numerous, and more laſting.</p>
            <p>Thus ſigh'd he away the melancholy
Night; but no ſooner had Aurora,
with bluſhes in her cheeks (as conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that ſhe was juſt riſen from the
embraces of Tithon) advanc'd through
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0063300200:127"/>
the purple gates of the eaſt, but Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
roſe: He roſe indeed, but Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
the companion of his ſlumbers,
roſe and wak'd with him. This was
the firſt day that he amuſed himſelf
with the gaudy Ornaments of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
that with ſecret pleaſure he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated
his Face, and the ſymmetry
of his limbs in a looking-glaſs. And
now forſaking his ſolitary apartment,
he walked directly to the habitation
that confined the Object of his deſires.
But as it is obſerv'd that the Curious
never wander into the City to indulge
their thirſt of knowledge'till about the
hours of eleven or twelve; the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
has ever been the ſeaſon of Repoſe
for all thoſe Animals, who (trapann'd
by the frauds of Men) have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
to change their Woods and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes
for Lodgings in Cities at the
rate of four ſhillings a week. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Martin at this early hour was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaluted by the ſound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
nor were his eyes feaſted as before
with the pleaſing picture of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs;
but he walked to and fro before
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0063300200:128"/>
the door with folded arms, from the
hour of five to eleven, humming in a
low and melancholy tune.</p>
            <p>The Trumpet no ſooner ſounded,
but his heart leapt for joy, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſix-pence gain'd him a ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
into her apartment. Yet this
day alſo, he only own'd his Paſſion in
the language of his Eyes: But alas!
this language is only underſtood by thoſe
that love, and Lindamira remain'd ſtill
ignorant of his Paſſion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it was no ſmall
cauſe of wonder to Mr. Randal, that
this Gentleman ſhould come every day
to behold the ſame ſhow. He, no leſs
covetous than the Guardian of a rich
Heireſs, entertain'd a ſuſpicion that
Martin had a deſign of ſtealing the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
He thereupon iſſued out ſtrict
Orders, not to admit our Lover on any
pretence whatſoever. What Torments
muſt this occaſion in the raging feaver
of Love! Martin had now recourſe to
Stratagem, and by a Bribe (which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
even the Ermine and Scarlet Robe
cannot reſiſt) gain'd the Dwarf who
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0063300200:129"/>
kept the gates of the Show-room, to
promote his Amour. He promis'd to
convey a Letter to Lindamira the ſame
evening, if he would bring it him
when darkneſs favour'd his deſign, at
the apartment next the Monſters. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
overjoy'd, haſted home, and after
having conſulted all the Authors that
treat of Love, compoſed his Billet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doux,
and at the time appointed went
to entruſt it to the hands of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
Softly he ſtole up ſtairs, approach'd
the door, and gave a gentle rap; when
on a ſudden a ſmall hand was thruſt
through a little hole at the bottom of
the door, whence iſſued an unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
ſqueaking voice. Martin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
it to be the Signal, delivered
his Epiſtle, and made his retreat unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.
He was no ſooner retir'd, but
Mr. Randal enter'd, and (as it was his
uſual cuſtom before he went to bed)
took a view if all were ſafe in the
Show-room. At his coming in, he
ſaw his Monkey exceedingly buſy in
picking the Seal-wax by little bits from
a Letter, which he turn'd over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0063300200:130"/>
with infinite ſatisfaction. Mr.
Randal, not thinking it a breach of
honour to pry into the ſecrets of his
own family, took the Letter from him,
and read as follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <head>To the moſt amiable LINDAMIRA,</head>
                  <p>WHile others, O darling of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
look upon thee with the
eyes of Curioſity, I behold thee with
thoſe of Love. Since I have been
ſtruck with thy moſt aſtoniſhing
Charms, how have I call'd upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to make a new head, new arms,
and a new body to ſprout from this
ſingle Trunk of mine, and to double
every member, ſo to render me a
proper Mate for ſo lovely a Pair!
but think to how little purpoſe it will
be for thee to ſtay till Nature ſhall
form another of thy kind! In ſuch
beauties ſhe exhauſts her whole art,
and cannot afford to be prodigal. Ages
muſt be numbred, nay perhaps ſome
Comet may vitrify this Globe on which
we tread, before we behold a Caſtor
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0063300200:131"/>
and a Pollux reſembling the beauteous
Lindamira and Indamora. Nature
forms her wonders for the Wiſe, and
ſuch a Maſter-piece ſhe could deſign
for none but a Philoſopher. Ceaſe
then to diſplay thoſe beauties to the
prophane Vulgar, which were created
to crown the deſires of</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>Your Paſſionate Admirer,
MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS.</signed>
                  </closer>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>The Dwarf enter'd as he was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Letter, and perceiving his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
mov'd with paſſion, immediately
fell on his knees and confeſs'd the
whole affair. Mr. Randal bent on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
cauſed him to haſten to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's
houſe, with aſſurances that Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damira
had read his Letter with infinite
ſatisfaction, and conjured him that he
would immediately favour her eſcape.
Martin overjoy'd at the news, flew thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the Wings of Love. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
Dwarf conducted him up ſtairs
in the dark, gently open'd the door,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0063300200:132"/>
and bad him enter. How happy was
Martin in that inſtant, who thought
of nothing but leaping into the four
ſoft arms of his Miſtreſs! when lo, on
a ſudden he ſaw at the further end of
the Room two glitt'ring balls of Fire,
which roll'd to and fro in a moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner. Immediately his ears were
invaded with horrid hiſſings and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
the balls of Fire drew nearer
him, and the noiſe redoubled as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd.
Our Philoſopher bold and
reſolute with love, ventur'd towards it;
when all at once he perceiv'd ſomething
graſp him hard by the throat, and fix
as it were ſharp lances in his cheek, ſo
that blood trickled amain down his chin.
Thrice Martin eſſay'd to free himſelf,
but vain were all his endeavours: till
at length, to ſave his life, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to betray his Intrigue, and alarm
the houſe with reiterated cries of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
The apartment of the Bohemian
Beauties being the adjoining Room,
they were the firſt that enter'd with a
light to his aſſiſtance. Martin all bloody
as he was, a moſt fierce Cat-a-moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0063300200:133"/>
hanging at his chin, (which Mr.
Randal had maliciouſly placed there on
purpoſe) at the ſight of Lindamira
forgot his diſtreſs. Ah, my Love! (he
cry'd) how like is thy fate to that of
Thiſbe! who ſtaying but a moment too
late, found, as ſhe thought, her miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Lover torn in pieces by a Savage
beaſt! The affrighted Damſels ſkriek'd
aloud, Mr. Randal with all his Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
ruſh'd into the room, and now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
hand conſpired to free his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaw
from the ſharp teeth of the enraged-Monſter.
But the Lady, whoſe heart
melted at the piteous Spectacle, was ſo
zealous in this office of Humanity, that
the Cat-a-mountain, provok'd at her
good-natur'd diligence, leap'd furiouſly
on her, and wounded three of her hands
and her two noſes, to ſuch a barbarous
degree that ſhe was not fit to be ſhown
publickly for the ſpace of three weeks.
The generous Lover, more wounded
at this Spectacle than at all the ſcratches
he had himſelf receiv'd, charg'd the
monſter again with the utmoſt Intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
and reſcued his mangled Miſtreſs.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0063300200:134"/>
Then (having taken her by the hand,
and given it a gentle graſp) he retreated
with his eye fixed upon her, and juſt
as he left the room (in a low and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Accent) thus breath'd forth his
Soul. <hi>Behold, all this have I ſuffered
for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such, and ſo modeſt was the firſt
Declaration of Love, made on this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
occaſion by our youthful Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.
Nor was it ungently receiv'd by
the ſimple and innocent Lindamira;
who hitherto unus'd to the ſoft Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of adoring Slaves, had rather
been wonder'd at than belov'd; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
but imperfect notions of that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
language, from the Addreſſes only
of the black Prince or the Dwarf.</p>
            <p>Martin, notwithſtanding this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
adventure, ſtill purſued his
wiſhes. His Letters were now no
more intercepted. Lindamira read
them, and behav'd like other courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dames when they receive thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Teſtimonials; conceal'd them
from her Guardian, and return'd the
moſt engaging anſwers. In ſhort, ſhe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0063300200:135"/>
was ſo far captivated, as to reſolve no
longer to be gaz'd at like a publick
Beauty in her own Aſſembly; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from the world, and become the
virtuous Miſtreſs of a Family.</p>
            <p>But Fate had ſo ordain'd, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
was not more enamoured on Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damira,
than Indamora was on Martin.
She, jealous that her Siſter had the
greateſt ſhare in this conqueſt, reſented
that an equal application had not been
made to herſelf. She teiz'd Lindami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
to ſuch a degree on this ſubject, as
made her promiſe to ſee Martin no
more. But then again might Indamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
be deem'd the unhappieſt of Women,
whom her Paſſion and Imprudence had
robb'd of the ſight of her Lover. Yet
ſhame cauſed her to conceal thoſe anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
from her Siſter. And let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
judge how unhappy the Nymph
muſt be, who was even depriv'd the
univerſal Relief of a <hi>Soliloquy.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
thus ſhe thought, without being
allow'd to tell it to any Grove or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Stream.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0063300200:136"/>
Wretched Indamora! if Lindamira
muſt never more ſee Martin, Martin
ſhall never again bleſs the eyes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damora:
Yet why do I ſay wretched?
ſince my Rival can never poſſeſs my
Lover without me. The pangs that
others feel in Abſence, from the thought
of thoſe Joys that bleſs their Rivals,
can never ſting thy boſom; nor can
they mortify thee by making thee a
Witneſs, without giving thee at the
ſame time a ſhare of their Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Change then thy proceeding,
Indamora; thy Jealouſy muſt act a new
and unheard-of part, and promote the
intereſt of thy Rival, as the only way
to the enjoyment of thy Lover.</p>
            <p>From that moment ſhe ſtudied by all
methods to advance her Siſter's Amour,
and in that her own. And thus there
appeared in theſe three Lovers as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
a Conjunction of Paſſions
as of Perſons: Love had reconcil'd
himſelf to his mortal foes, to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
in Martin, and to Jealouſy in Inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0063300200:137"/>
And now flouriſh'd the Amour of
Martin; Succeſs even prevented his
wiſhes; the Marriage was agreed on,
and the day appointed. Sunday was
the time when Mr. Randal's Abſence
favour'd their hopes, who never on that
day, omitted taking the freſh air in the
fields: The key of the door he always
took with him. <hi>Crambe</hi> was ready
laid at a convenient diſtance, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
them with a ladder of
ropes. The ladder was thrown up, and
the Signal given at the window. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damira
haſten'd to the Alarm of Love,
when behold a new Diſaſter! As ſhe
was getting out of the window, the
weight of her body on one ſide, and
that of Indamora's on the other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
cauſed them to ſtick in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
Lindamira hung with her coats
ſtript up to the navel without, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damora
in no leſs immodeſt poſture
within. The <hi>Manteger,</hi> who for his
gentleneſs was allowed to walk at large
in the houſe, was ſo heighten'd at this
ſight, that he ruſh'd upon Indamora
like a barborous Raviſher. Indamora
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0063300200:138"/>
cry'd aloud for help. Martin flew to
revenge this inſolent attempt, of a Rape
on his wedding-day. The luſtful Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
driv'n from our double Lucrece,
fled into the middle of the room, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
by the valorous and indignant
Martin. Three times the hot Mante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
frighted at the furious menaces of
his Antagoniſt, made a circle round the
chamber, and three times the ſwift-footed
Martin purſued him. He caught
up the <hi>Horn</hi> of a <hi>Unicorn,</hi> which lay
ready for the entertainment of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſpectator, and brandiſhing it over
his head in airy circles, hurl'd it againſt
the hairy ſon of Hanniman; who
wrinkling his brown forehead, and
gnaſhing his teeth in indignation,
ſtoop'd low: The horny Lance juſt
raz'd his left ſhoulder, and ſtuck into
the tapeſtry hangings. Provok'd at this
the grinning Offspring of Hanniman
caught up the pointed <hi>Horn</hi> of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telope,</hi>
and aim'd a blow againſt his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſmay'd
Adverſary. Our heroic Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who held his hat before him like
a ſhield, receiv'd the weapon full on
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0063300200:139"/>
the Crown; it pierc'd the beaver, and
gave a ſmall rent to his breeches. Then
the human Champion flung with mighty
violence the hinder <hi>foot</hi> of an <hi>Elk,</hi>
which hit the beſtial Combatant full
on the nether jaw. He reel'd, but
ſoon recovering, and his ſkill in war
lying rather in the cloſe fight than in
projectile weapons, he endeavour'd to
cloſe with him: Forthwith aſſailing
him behind unawares, he clamber'd
up his back, and pluck'd up by the
roots a mighty graſp of hair—but
Martin ſoon diſmounted him, and kept
him at a diſtance. Love not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
his breaſt with Courage, but gave
double ſtrength to his ſinews; he heav'd
up the <hi>hand</hi> of a prodigious <hi>Sea-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>;
which when the chatt'ring Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
beheld, he no leſs furious, wielded
the pond'rous <hi>Thigh-bone</hi> of a <hi>Giant.</hi>
And now they ſtood oppos'd to each
other, like the dread Captain of the
ſevenfold Shield and the redoubted
Hector. The Thigh-bone miſs'd its
aim; but the hand of the Sea-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
deſcended directly on the head of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0063300200:140"/>
the Sylvian Raviſher. The Monſter
chatter'd horribly; he ſtretch'd his
quiv'ring limbs on the floor; and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſleep lock'd faſt his eyelids.</p>
            <p>The Lady from the window, like
another Helen from the Trojan wall,
was witneſs of the Combat cauſed by
her own beauty. She ſaw with what
gracefulneſs her Hero enter'd the Liſts,
admir'd his activity and courage in the
combat, and was a joyful witneſs of
his Triumph: She gave a ſpring from
the window, and with open arms and
legs embraced the neck and ſhoulders
of her Champion. Our Philoſopher
receiv'd her with his face turn'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
from her, and in that manner
convey'd her into the ſtreet. He call'd
a Chair with all haſte, but no chairman
would take her; which oblig'd him
to bear his extraordinary burden till he
found a Coach, in which he carried
her off, and was happily united to her
that very evening, by a Reverend Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman
in the Fleet, in the holy Bands
of Matrimony.</p>

No ſooner had the Maſter of the Show

ſeiz'd on the Bohemian Ladies by a
<hi>Warrant</hi>; and not content with having

to open all the Sluices of the

went to Council to adviſe upon all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
methods of revenge.</p>
            <p>The firſt point he proceeded on was
the <hi>Property</hi> of his Monſter, and the
queſtion propounded was, <note n="1" place="bottom">
                  <hi>An Servi poſſint invitis Dominis Matrimonium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahere?</hi>

the Marriage did not exempt them

            </p>
            <p>This put him in no ſmall hopes of

acquiring a property in his <hi>Bodily iſſue</hi>

            <p>At length Mr. Randal, being vext at

left no Artifice or Addreſs untry'd to

perplex the unhappy Philoſopher: He
even contriv'd with infinite cunning, to
alienate Indamora's affections from him;
and debauch'd her into an Intrigue with
a Creature, of his own, the black
Prince; whom he ſecretly caus'd to
marry her, while her Siſter was <hi>aſleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon Martin was reduc'd to turn
<hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and commenc'd a Suit in the

for Cohabitation with his ſaid wife.
He was advis'd to inſiſt upon a new
Point, (viz.) <q rend="inline">" That Lindamira and

            </p>
            <p>The Monſter-maſter, further to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
Martin, forc'd Lindamira to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition

            </p>
            <p>Martin now began to repent that he

being impannel'd, declar'd, that as to

               <p>Dr. PENNY-FEATHER.</p>
               <p>" I appear before your Honour in
behalf of Martinus Scriblerus, Batch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elor
of Phyſick, in a Complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the black Prince of
Monopotapa; Inaſmuch as the ſaid
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, hath malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
forcibly, and unlawfully ſeiz'd,
raviſh'd, and detain'd Lindamira-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damora,
the wife of the ſaid Martin,
and the body of the ſaid Lindamira-Indamora,
from time to time ever
ſince, hath wickedly, leudly, and
indecently us'd, handled, and evil
entreated. And in order to make
this his Villainy more laſting, hath
preſum'd to marry this our Wife,
pretending to give his wickedneſs the
Sanction of a Law. And foraſmuch
as the Adulterer doth not deny the
fact, but inſiſts upon his ſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
as lawful, we cannot open the
Caſe more plainly to your Honour,
than by anſwering his Reaſons,
which indeed, to mention, is to
confute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0063300200:148"/>
" He maintains no leſs an abſurdity
than this, that <hi>One</hi> is <hi>Two</hi>; and that
Lindamira-Indamora, the individual
wife of the Plaintiff, is not one, but
two Perſons: And that the ſaid Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw
is not marry'd to
Lindamira, the wife of the ſaid
Martin, but to his own lawful wife
Indamora, another individual Perſon
diſtinct from the ſaid Lindamira,
tho' join'd to her by a ſtrong Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Nature."</p>
               <p>In anſwer whereunto, we ſhall prove
three things: " <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the ſaid
Lindamira-Indamora, now our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
wife, makes but one individual
perſon." </p>
               <p>" Secondly, that if they made two
individual perſons, yet they conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
but one wife." </p>
               <p>" <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that ſuppoſing they made
two individual perſons, and two
wives, each lawfully marry'd to her
own huſband, yet Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw
hath no right to detain
Lindamira our lawfully wedded wife,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0063300200:149"/>
on pretence of being marry'd to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damora." </p>
               <p>As to the firſt point: " It will be
neceſſary to determine the <hi>conſtituent
Principle</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Individuality,</hi>
which in reſpect of mankind, we take
to be one ſimple identical ſoul, in
one ſimple identical body. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuality,
ſameneſs, or identity of
the body, is not determin'd (as ſome
vainly imagine) by one head, and a
certain number of arms, legs, and
other members; but in one ſimple,
ſingle <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or member of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration."</p>
               <p>" Let us ſearch Profane Hiſtory,
and we ſhall find Geryon with three
heads, and Briareus with an hundred
hands. Let us ſearch Sacred Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and we meet with one of the
ſons of the Giants with ſix Fingers
to each Hand, and ſix Toes to each
Foot; yet none never accounted
Geryon or Briareus more than one
Perſon: and give us leave to ſay, the
wife of the ſaid Geryon would have
had a good action againſt any women
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0063300200:150"/>
who ſhould have eſpous'd themſelves
to the two other heads of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.
The Reaſon is plain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
each of theſe having but one
ſimple <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or one member of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
could be look'd upon but
as one ſingle perſon."</p>
               <p>" In conformity to this, when we
behold this one member, we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the Sex, and pronounce it a
<hi>Man,</hi> or a <hi>Woman</hi>; or, as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins
expreſs it, <hi>unus Vir, una Mulier,
une Homme, une Femme, One Man,
One Woman.</hi> For the ſame Reaſon
Man and Wife are ſaid to be one
Fleſh, becauſe united in that part
which conſtitutes the Sameneſs and
Individuality of each ſex."</p>
               <p>" And as where there is but one
Member of Generation, there is but
one Body, ſo there can be but one
Soul; becauſe the ſaid Organ of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is the Seat of the Soul; and
conſequently where there is but one
ſuch Organ, there can be but one
Soul. Let me here ſay without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to truth, that no Philoſopher,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0063300200:151"/>
either of the paſt or preſent age,
hath taken more pains to diſcover
where the Soul keeps her reſidence,
than the Plaintiff, the learned Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus
Scriblerus: And after his moſt
diligent enquiries and experiments,
he hath been verily perſuaded, that
the Organ of Generation is the true
and only <hi>Seat of the Soul.</hi> That this
part is ſeated in the middle, and near
the Center of the whole Body, is
obvious to your Honour's view.
From thence, like the Sun in the
Center of the world, the Soul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes
her warmth and vital influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
Let the Brain glory in the
Wiſdom of the aged, the Science of
the learned, the Policy of the ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and the Invention of the witty;
the accidental Amuſements and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations
of the Soul, and mortal
as the Poſſeſſors of them! It is to
the Organs of Generation that we
owe Man himſelf; there the Soul is
employ'd in works ſuitable to the
Dignity of her Nature, and (as we
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0063300200:152"/>
may ſay) ſits brooding over ages ye
unborn."</p>
               <p>" We need not tell your Honour,
that it has been the opinion of many
moſt learned Divines and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
that the Soul, as well as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
is produc'd <hi>Ex Traduce.</hi> This
doctrine has been defended by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
irrefragable, and accounts for
difficulties, without it, inexplicable.
All which arguments conclude with
equal ſtrength, for the Soul's being
ſeated in the Organs of Generation.
For ſince the whole man, both Soul
and Body, is <hi>there</hi> form'd, and ſince
nothing can operate but where it <hi>is,</hi>
it follows that the Soul muſt reſide
in that individual place, where ſhe
exerts her generative and plaſtick
Powers."</p>
               <p>" This our Doctrine is confirm'd by
all thoſe Experiments, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to prove the abſolute Dominion
which that part hath over the whole
Body. We ſee how many Women,
who are deaf to the perſwaſions of
the Eloquent, the inſinuations of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0063300200:153"/>
Crafty, and the threats of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious,
are eaſily govern'd by ſome
poor Logger-head, unfurniſh'd with
the leaſt art, but that of making
immediate application to this <hi>Seat
of the Soul.</hi> The impreſſions made
by the Ear are ſo diſtant, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thro' ſo many windings, that
they loſe their Energy: But your
Honour, by immediately applying
to the Organ of Generation, acts like
a bold and wife Petitioner, who goes
ſtrait to the <hi>very Throne</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat</hi>
of the Monarch."</p>
               <p>" And whereas it is objected, that
here are <hi>two Wills,</hi> and therefore <hi>two</hi>
different <hi>Perſons</hi>; we anſwer, if
Multiplicity of Wills imply'd mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of Perſons, there are few
Huſbands but what are guilty of
<hi>Poligamy,</hi> there being in the ſame
Woman great and notorious diverſity
of Wills: A Point which we ſhall
not need to inſiſt upon before any
marry'd perſon, much leſs of your
Honour's Experience."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0063300200:154"/>
" Thus have we made good our firſt
and principal Point; That if the wife
of the Plaintiff, Lindamira-Indamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
hath but <hi>one</hi> Organ of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhe is but <hi>one individual Perſon,</hi>
in the trueſt and moſt proper ſenſe of
Individuality. And that the matter
of Fact is ſo, we are willing to put
upon a fair Trial by a Jury of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
whom your Honour ſhall
think fit to nominate and appoint,
to inſpect the body of the ſaid Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damira-Indamora."</p>
               <p>" <hi>Secondly,</hi> we are to prove, that
though Lindamira-Indamora were
<hi>two</hi> individual Perſons, conſiſting
each of a Soul and Body, yet if they
have but one Organ of Generation,
they can conſtitute but one Wife.
For, from whence can the <hi>Unity</hi> of
any thing be denominated, but from
that which <hi>conſtitutes</hi> the <hi>Eſſence</hi> or
principal <hi>Uſe</hi> of it? Thus, if a Knife
or Hatchet have but one blade,
though two handles, it will properly
be denominated but one Knife, or
one Hatchet; inaſmuch as it hath
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0063300200:155"/>
but one of that which conſtitutes
the Eſſence or principal Uſe of a
Knife or Hatchet. So if there were
not only one, but twenty <hi>Suppoſita
Rationalia</hi> with one common Organ
of Generation, that one Syſtem
would only make one Wife. Upon
the whole, let not a few Heads,
Legs, or Arms extraordinary, biaſs
your Honour's Judgment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
the Plaintiff of his legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty:
In which right our Client is
ſo ſtrongly fortify'd, that allowing
both the former Propoſitions to be
falſe, and that there were two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
two Bodies, two Rational Souls,
yea, and two Organs of Generation,
yet would it ſtill be plain in the
third place," </p>
               <p>" That the Defendant, Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
can have no Right
to detain from the Plaintiff, his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
wedded <hi>Wife,</hi> Lindamira.
For, abſtracting from the <hi>Priority</hi>
of the marriage of our Client, by
which it would ſeem he acquir'd a
property in his Wife and <hi>all other</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0063300200:156"/>
                  <hi>Matter inſeparably annex'd unto her,</hi>
it is evident Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
by his marriage to Indamora,
could never acquire any property in
Lindamira; nor can produce any
Cauſe why both of them ſhould live
with himſelf, rather than with the
other? Therefore, we humbly hope
your Honour will order the body of
Our ſaid Wife to be reſtor'd to us,
and due Cenſure paſt on the ſaid
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw."</p>

               <p>" <hi>Secondly,</hi> That although there were

that it will ſubject the Plaintiff to the

               <p>" <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We doubt not to prove
that the ſaid Lindamira-Indamora
hath two diſtinct parts of Generation." </p>
               <p>" And <hi>Firſt</hi> we will ſhow, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the individual Eſſence of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
nor the Seat of the Soul, doth
reſide in the Organ of Generation;
and this firſt from Reaſon. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
indeed muſt it be, to
make that the Seat of the Rational
Soul, which alone ſets us on a level
with beaſts: or to conceive, that the
Eſſence of Unity and Individuality
ſhould conſiſt in that which is the
Source of Diſcord and Diviſion. In
a word, what can be a greater ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity,
than to affirm Beſtiality to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0063300200:158"/>
be the Eſſence of Humanity, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the Center of Light, and Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
the Seat of Purity?"</p>
               <p>" We could from the authority of
the moſ eminent Philoſophers of all
ages, confirm this our Aſſertion; few
of whom ever had the impudence to
degrade this Queen, the Rational
Soul, to the very loweſt and vileſt
Apartment, or rather Sink of her
whole Palace. But we ſhall produce
fill a greater Authority than theſe,
to manifeſt that perſonal Individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
did ſubſiſt, when there was no
ſuch generative Carnality."</p>
               <p>" It hath been ſtrenuouſly maintain'd
by many holy Divines (and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
by Thomas Aquinas) that our
firſt Parents, in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
did in no wife propagate their
ſpecies after the preſent common
manner of men and beaſts: but that
the propagation at that time muſt
have been by Intuition, Coalition of
Ideas, or ſome pure and ſpiritual
manner, ſuitable to the dignity of
their ſtation. And though the Sexes
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0063300200:159"/>
were diſtinguiſh'd in that State, yet
it is plain it was not by parts, ſuch
as we have at preſent; ſince, if our
Firſt Parents had any ſuch, they
muſt have known it; And it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that they diſcover'd them not
till after the Fall; when it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
thoſe parts were the immediate
Excreſcence of Sin, and only grew
forth to render them fitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
for thoſe a Beaſts among
which they were driven."</p>
               <p>" It is a Maxim in Philoſophy, that
<hi>Generatio unius eſt Corruptio alterius:</hi>
whence it is apparent that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſaical
Generation was of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature from ours, free from all
Corruption and Imbecility. This
is further corroborated by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of thoſe Doctors of the
Church who have aſſerted, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fall, Adam was endow'd
with a continual uninterrupted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Generation; which can be
explain'd of no other than of that
<hi>Intuitive Generation</hi> above ſaid: Since
it is well known to all, the leaſt

ſkill'd in Anatomy, that the preſent

incapable of this continual Faculty."</p>
               <p>" We come now to our <hi>ſecond</hi> point,
wherein the Advocate for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
aſſerteth, that if there were two
perſons, and one Organ of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this Syſtem would conſtitute but
one Wife. This will put the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
ſtill in a worſe condition, and
render him plainly guilty of Bigamy,
Rape, or Inceſt. For if there be
but one ſuch Organ of Generation,
then both the perſons of Lindamira
and Indamora have an equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
in it; and what is Indamora's
property cannot be diſpos'd of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
her conſent. We therefore
bring the whole to this ſhort iſſue;
whether the Plaintiff <hi>Martinus
Scriblerus</hi> had the <hi>Conſent</hi> of Inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora,
or <hi>not?</hi> If he hath <hi>had</hi> her

               <p>" The Defendant, Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,

of this his wife Indamora. Yet
make we no doubt, that it will upon
inſpection appear, that the ſaid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
is diſtinct from that of Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira:
Whereupon we crave to hear
the Report of the Jury of Matrons,
appointed to inſpect the body of the
ſaid gentlewoman."</p>
               <p>" And if the Matter of Fact be thus,
give me your Honour's permiſſion
to repeat what hath been ſaid by
the Advocate for the Plaintiff; to
wit, that <hi>Martinus Scriblerus,</hi>
Batchelor in Phyſick, by this his
Marriage with <hi>Lindamira,</hi> could, in
no wiſe, acquire any property in the
body of Indamora; not ſhew any
Cauſe why this duplicated Wife
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0063300200:162"/>
Lindamira-Indamora, ſhould abide
with him, rather than with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw
of Monomotapa."</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Jury of Matrons having made
their Report, and it appearing from
thence that the Parts of Generation in
Lindamira and Indamora were diſtinct;
the Judge took time to deliberate, and
the next Court-Day he ſpoke to this
effect.</p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
               <p>" I am of opinion that Lindamira
and Indamora are diſtinct perſons,
and that both the Marriages are
good and valid: Therefore I order
you Martinus Scriblerus, Batchelor
in Phyſick, and you Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
Prince of Monomotapa, to
cohabit with your wives, and to lie
in bed each on the ſide of his own
wife. I hope, Gentlemen, you will
ſeriouſly conſider, that you are under
a ſtricter Tye than common Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers-in-law;
that being, as it were,
Joint Proprietors of one common
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0063300200:163"/>
Tenement, you will ſo behave as
good fellow-lodgers ought to do,
and with great modeſty each to his
reſpective ſiſter-in-law, abſtaining
from all further Familiarities than
what Conjugal Duties do naturally
oblige you to. Conſider alſo by
how ſmall limits the Duty and the
Treſpaſs is divided, leſt, while ye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the duty of Matrimony, <hi>ye</hi>
heedleſsly ſlide into the ſin of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery."</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Sentence pleas'd neither Party;
and Martin appeal'd from the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Arches</hi>; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
the Sentence of the Conſiſtory.</p>
            <p>It was at laſt brought before a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
of <hi>Delegates</hi>; who, having
weigh'd the Caſe, revers'd the Sentence
of the inferior Courts, and diſannull'd
the marriage, upon the following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
<q rend="inline">" That allowing the manner of
Cohabitation enjoin'd to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
(though highly inconvenient)
yet the <hi>Jus petendi &amp; reddendi De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum
conjugale</hi> being at all times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0063300200:164"/>
in both huſbands and both wives,
and at the ſame time impoſſible
in more than one; Two perſons
could not have a Right to the entire
poſſeſſion of the ſame thing, at the
ſame time; nor could one ſo enjoy
his property, as to debar another from
the uſe of his, who has an equal
right. So much as to the <hi>Debitum
petendi,</hi> and as to the <hi>Debitum red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi,</hi>
                  <hi>nemo tenetur ad impoſſibile.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the Lords, with great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

            </head>
            <p>THIS affair being thus unhappily

unable to ſupport the Affliction, as well
as to avoid the many diſagreeable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0063300200:165"/>
reſolv'd to quit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>But we muſt not here neglect to
mention, that during the whole Courſe
of this Proceſs, his continual Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the Courts in his own Cauſe,
and his invincible Curioſity for all that
paſt in the Cauſes of others, gave him
a wonderful inſight into this Branch
of Learning, which muſt be confeſt to
have been ſo improved by the Moderns,
as beyond all compariſon to exceed the
Ancients. From the day his firſt Bill
was filed, he began to collect <hi>Reports</hi>;
and before his Suit was ended, he had
time abundantly ſufficient to compile a
very conſiderable Volume. His Anger
at his ill ſucceſs caus'd him to deſtroy
the greateſt part of theſe <hi>Reports</hi>; and
only to preſerve ſuch, as diſcover'd moſt
of the Chicanery and Futility of the
practice. Theſe we have ſome hopes
to recover, if they were only miſlaid at
his Removal; if not, the world will be
enough inſtructed to lament the loſs,
by the only one now publick, viz.
The <hi>Caſe of</hi> Stradling <hi>and</hi> Stiles, <hi>in an</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0063300200:166"/>
               <hi>Action concerning certain</hi> black <hi>and</hi>
white Horſes.</p>
            <p>We cannot wonder that he contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a violent Averſion to the <hi>Law,</hi> as
is evident from a whole Chapter of his
Travels. And perhaps his Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
gave him alſo a Diſ-inclination to
the <hi>Fair Sex,</hi> for whom on ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
he does not expreſs all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and Admiration poſſible. This
doubtleſs muſt be the Reaſon, that in
no part of his <hi>Travels</hi> we find him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
by any <hi>ſtrange Princeſs</hi>; nor
have we the leaſt account that he ever
relaps'd into this Paſſion, except what
is mention'd in the Introduction, of the
<hi>Spaniſh Lady's Phenomenon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in the year 1699 that Martin
ſet out on his <hi>Travels.</hi> Thou wilt
certainly be very curious to know what
they were? It is not yet time to inform
thee. But what hints I am at liberty
to give, I will.</p>
            <p>Thou ſhalt know then, that in his
firſt Voyage he was carry'd by a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
Storm, to a Diſcovery of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0063300200:167"/>
Remains of the ancient <hi>Pygmaean</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>That in his ſecond, he was as happily
ſhipwreck'd on the Land of the <hi>Giants,</hi>
now the moſt humane people in the
world.</p>
            <p>That in his third Voyage, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
a whole Kingdom of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
who govern by the <hi>Mathematicks</hi>;
with whoſe admirable Schemes and
Projects he return'd to benefit his own
dear Country, but had the misfortune
to find them rejected by the envious
Miniſters of <hi>Queen Anne,</hi> and himſelf
ſent treacherouſly away.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that in his fourth
Voyage he diſcovers a Vein of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
proceeding almoſt to a Diſguſt of
his Species; but above all, a mortal
Deteſtation to the whole flagitious Race
of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and a final Reſolution
not to give in any <hi>Memorial</hi> to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State,</hi> in order to ſubject the
Lands he diſcover'd to the <hi>Crown</hi> of
<hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if, by theſe hints, the Reader
can help himſelf to a further diſcovery
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0063300200:168"/>
of the Nature and Contents of theſe
Travels, he is welcome to as much light
as they afford him; I am oblig'd by all
the tyes of honour not to ſpeak more
openly.</p>
            <p>But if any man ſhall ever ſee ſuch
very extraordinary Voyages, into ſuch
very extraordinary Nations, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
the moſt diſtinguiſhing marks of

            <p>AND here it ſeems but natural, to
lament the unfortunate End of
the Amour of our Philoſopher. But
the Hiſtorian of theſe Memoirs on the
contrary cries out, <q rend="inline">" Happy, thrice

            <p>Here therefore, at this great Period,
we end our firſt Book. And here, O Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
we entreat thee utterly to forget
all thou haſt hitherto read, and to caſt

            <p>In the mean time, know what thou
oweſt, and what thou yet may'ſt owe,
to this excellent Perſon, this Prodigy of
our Age; who may well be called <hi>The

a Sagacity peculiar to himſelf, he hath
diſcover'd Effects in their very Cauſe;
and without the trivial helps of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or Obſervations, hath been the
Inventor of moſt of the modern Syſtems

            <p>He hath enrich'd Mathematicks

            </p>
            <p>To him we owe all the obſervations

            </p>

            <p>I ſhall mention only a few of his
Philoſophical and Mathematical Works.<list>
                  <item>1. A compleat Digeſt of the Laws
of Nature, with a Review of thoſe that
are obſolete or repealed, and of thoſe

that are ready to be renew'd and put in

Formation of the Univerſe, according
to the Epicurean Hypotheſis.</item>
                  <item>3. An Inveſtigation of the Quantity
of real Matter in the Univerſe, with the

ſolid Matter to that of fluid.</item>
                  <item>4. Microſcopical Obſervations of the
Figure and Bulk of the conſtituent
Parts of all fluids. A Calculation of
the proportion in which the Fluids of
the earth decreaſe, and of the period in
which they will be totally exhauſted.</item>
                  <item>5. A Computation of the Duration
of the Sun, and how long it will laſt
before it be burn'd out.</item>
                  <item>6. A Method to apply the Force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
from the immenſe Velocity of

                  <item>7. An anſwer to the queſtion of a

to the Inhabitants of our earth?
To which is ſubjoin'd a Calculation,

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0063300200:173"/>
eat for Supper, conſidering that they
paſs a Night equal to fifteen of our
natural days.</item>
                  <item>8. A Demonſtration of the natural
Dominion of the Inhabitants of the
Earth over thoſe of the Moon, if ever
an intercourſe ſhould be open'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. With a Propoſal of a
<hi>Partition-Treaty,</hi> among the earthly
Potentates, in caſe of ſuch diſcovery.</item>
                  <item>9. Tide-Tables, for a Comet, that is
to approximate towards the Earth.</item>
                  <item>10. The Number of the Inhabitants
of London determin'd by the Reports
of the Gold-finders, and the Tonnage
of their Carriages; with allowance for
the extraordinary quantity of the <hi>Ingeſta</hi>
and <hi>Egeſta</hi> of the people of England,
and a deduction of what is left under
dead walls, and dry ditches.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It will from hence be evident, how
much all his Studies were directed to
the univerſal Benefit of Mankind.
Numerous have been his Projects to this
end, of which <hi>Two</hi> alone will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to ſhow the amazing Grandeur
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0063300200:174"/>
of his Genius. The firſt was a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
by a general contribution of all
Princes, to pierce the firſt cruſt or <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleus</hi>
of this our <hi>Earth,</hi> quite through,
to the next concentrical Sphere: The
advantage he propos'd from it was, to
find the <hi>Parallax</hi> of the <hi>Fixt Stars</hi>;
but chiefly to refute Sir Iſaac Newton's
Theory of <hi>Gravity,</hi> and Mr. Halley's
of the <hi>Variations.</hi> The ſecond was, to
build <hi>Two Poles</hi> to the <hi>Meridian,</hi> with
immenſe Light-houſes on the top of
them; to ſupply the defect of Nature,
and to make the Longitude as eaſy to
be calculated as the Latitude. Both
theſe he could not but think very prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable,
by the Power of all the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of the World.</p>
            <p>May we preſume after theſe to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how he deſcended from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime
to the beneficial parts of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and particularly his extraordinary
practice of <hi>Phyſick.</hi> From the Age;
Complexion, or Weight of the perſon
given, he contrived to preſcribe at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance,
as well as at a Patient's bed-ſide.
He taught the way to many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0063300200:175"/>
Phyſicians, to cure their Patients
by <hi>Intuition,</hi> and to others to cure <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
looking on them at all.</hi> He projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Menſtruum to diſſolve the Stone,
made of Dr. Woodward's <hi>Univerſal
Deluge-water.</hi> His alſo was the device
to relieve Conſumptive or Aſthmatick
perſons by bringing freſh Air out of
the Country to Town, by pipes of the
nature of the Recipients of Air-pumps:
And to introduce the Native air of a
man's country into any other in which
he ſhould travel, with a ſeaſonable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromiſſion
of ſuch Steams as were moſt
familiar to him; to the inexpreſſible
comfort of many Scotſmen, Laplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and white Bears.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Phyſiognomy,</hi> his penetration is
ſuch, that from the <hi>Picture</hi> only of any
perſon, he can write his <hi>Life</hi>; and
from the features of the Parents, draw
the Portrait of any Child that is to be
born.</p>
            <p>Nor hath he been ſo enrapt in theſe
Studies, as to neglect the Polite Arts
of Painting, Architecture, Muſick,
Poetry, &amp;c. It was he that gave the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0063300200:176"/>
firſt hint to our modern <hi>Painters,</hi> to
improve the <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of their Portraits
by the uſe of ſuch <hi>Colours</hi> as would
faithfully and conſtantly accompany the
<hi>Life,</hi> not only in its preſent ſtate, but
in all its alterations, decays, age, and
death itſelf.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Architecture,</hi> he builds not with
ſo much regard to preſent ſymmetry or
conveniency, as with a Thought well
worthy a true lover of Antiquity, to
wit, the noble effect the Building will
have to poſterity, when it ſhall fall and
become a Ruin.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Muſick,</hi> I think Heidegger has
not the face to deny that he has been
much beholden to his Scores.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Poetry,</hi> he hath appear'd under a
hundred different names, of which we
may one day give a Catalogue.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Politicks,</hi> his Writings are of a
peculiar Caſt, for the moſt part Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
and the Drift of them often ſo
delicate and refin'd as to be miſtaken
by the vulgar. He once went ſo far
as to write a Perſuaſive to people to
eat their own Children, which was ſo
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0063300200:177"/>
little underſtood as to be taken in ill
part. He has often written againſt
<hi>Liberty</hi> in the name of <hi>Freemen</hi> and
<hi>Algernoon Sydney,</hi> in vindication of the
Meaſures of <hi>Spain</hi> under that of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi>
and in praiſe of <hi>Corruption</hi> under
thoſe of <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Publicola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that at his laſt departure
from England, in the Reign of Queen
<hi>Anne,</hi> apprehending leſt any of theſe
might be perverted to the Scandal of
the weak, or Encouragement of the
flagitious, he caſt them all, without
mercy, into a Bog-houſe near <hi>St.
James</hi>'s. Some however have been
with great diligence recover'd, and
fiſh'd up with a hook and line by the
Miniſterial Writers, which make at
preſent the great Ornaments of their
works.</p>
            <p>Whatever he judg'd beneficial to
Mankind, he conſtantly communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(not only during his ſtay among us,
but ever ſince his abſence) by ſome
method or other in which Oſtentation
had no part. With what incredible
Modeſty he conceal'd himſelf, is known
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0063300200:178"/>
to numbers of thoſe to whom he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd
ſometimes Epiſtles, ſometimes
Hints, ſometimes whole Treatiſes, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to Friends, Projects to Firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
Letters to Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Accounts to the Royal Society,
and innumerable others.</p>
            <p>All theſe will be vindicated to the
true Author, in the Courſe of theſe
Memoirs. I may venture to ſay they
cannot be unacceptable to any, but to
thoſe, who will appear too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
as <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> to be admitted as
<hi>Judges.</hi> Wherefore we warn the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
to take particular notice of all
ſuch as manifeſt any indecent Paſſion
at the appearance of this Work, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
moſt certainly involved in the
Guilt.</p>
