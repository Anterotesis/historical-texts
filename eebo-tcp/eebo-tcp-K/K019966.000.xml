            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
LETTER
TO THE
PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>WHEN I preſumed to write to
my countrymen laſt year, to
rouſe their ſpirit againſt Mr. <hi>Fox's
Eaſt-India bill,</hi> I had the happineſs
to find my letter received not only
with indulgence, but with a generous
warmth of heart which I can never
forget, but to the lateſt moment of
my life ſhall moſt gratefully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
The fire of loyalty was kindled.
It flew through our counties and our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0586200600:6"/>
boroughs. The King was addreſſed:
the conſtitution was ſaved. I was
proud to have been able thus <hi>ciere
viros;</hi> prouder ſtill than of receiving
the applauſe of the <hi>miniſter of the</hi>
CROWN, which he was pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
to me in a very handſome letter;
upon which, however, I ſet a high
value, conſidering not only the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
but the man; and accordingly
it ſhall be preſerved in the archives
of my family.</p>
            <p>I now feel myſelf called upon to
to write to them again, upon a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of leſs magnitude indeed, but of
moſt intereſting concern. The crown
is not in danger every day: GOD for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
it ſhould.</p>
            <q>
               <l>As if Misfortune made the throne her ſeat,</l>
               <l>And none could be unhappy but the great.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0586200600:7"/>
But what is the crown without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?
and what are ſubjects without
a good adminiſtration of juſtice? A
rage for <hi>innovation</hi> has gone forth;
and that rage, ſeconded by avarice
and inordinate love of power, in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
parties, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
intereſts, hath lately threatened,
and ſtill threatens, us with a violent
ſhock to our civil judicature, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the number of the lords of
ſeſſion from fifteen to ten, that ten
may have larger ſalaries. This "comes
home to our buſineſs and boſoms." It
is a very ſerious alarm indeed. As to
the barons of Exchequer, I ſhall ſay
nothing: It is but a modern court;
and we are told a perſon of high of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the law ſaid, they were not ſo
much judges as revenue officers.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0586200600:8"/>
But the <hi>Court of Seſſion</hi> has a vaſt juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
It was formed by James V.
of Scotland, <hi>anno</hi> 1532, after the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of the <hi>Parliament of Paris.</hi> It
conſiſted originally of ſeven church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ſeven laymen, and a prelate as
preſident. This was altered. They
are now all laymen; and none can
be appointed but who have been five
years advocates or principal clerks of
court, or ten years clerks to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
ſignet; but advocates are almoſt
always appointed. Their gowns are
of purple cloth and crimſon velvet,
very gracefully diſpoſed, and they ſtill
retain the ſacerdotal badge of a cawl
or pouch, which hangs on their
ſhoulders, as a part of the gown, like
that of the capuchins. Its juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not only ſupreme, in Scotland,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0586200600:9"/>
over all cauſes civil and conſiſtorial,
(that is to ſay, cauſes of the nature of
the eccleſiaſtical cauſes in England,
with this amazing difference, that
they have a power to give a ſentence
of divorce equivalent to an act of
parliament) but has alſo a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
extent in criminal caſes. And
let me add, that it has acquired a
kind of undefined arbitrary juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
called its <hi>nobile officium,</hi> for a
full and bold account of which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
you to Dr. <hi>Gilbert Stuart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but complain of the ſecret
and ſudden mode of framing and
bringing forward this momentous
bill.—What! ſhall the ſupreme civil
court of a country be diminiſhed one
third?—Shall an eſtabliſhment, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0586200600:10"/>
by the acquieſcence of ages, be
pulled to pieces without any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
whatever with the ſubjects of
that country, high or low; nay,
without ever conſulting the bar, the
<hi>faculty</hi> of <hi>advocates,</hi> that learned body
who are guardians of the law—<hi>antiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
juſtitiae.</hi> But <hi>ſcandal</hi> ſays, Mr.
<hi>Henry Dundas</hi> has been applied to
by ſome of the judges, who, after
feaſting at <hi>Bayll's</hi> French tavern, and
raiſing their ſpirits high with wine,
have formed the lofty wiſh of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
paying their court to <hi>Regina
Pecunia;</hi>—and Mr. <hi>Henry Dundas</hi>
(ſometimes called <hi>Harry the Ninth</hi>)
very willing to oblige thoſe ſenators,
and make them his devoted humble
ſervants, has nodded aſſent. <hi>Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam
ſane loudem, et ſpolia ampla re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertis.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0586200600:11"/>
But Mr. Dundas, not being
<hi>ſure</hi> that the people of Scotland are
yet <hi>entirely tame,</hi> has been too wiſe
to commit <hi>himſelf</hi> in this deſperate
buſineſs, but has only given inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and then Mr. <hi>Ilay Campbell,</hi>
the preſent lord advocate of Scotland,
whom his brethren did the honour to
elect their vice dean, riſes in the houſe
of commons with this ſame pretty
little bill, cut and dry, and thinks
he may at once kill his five men, and
in triumph call out, "Off with their
heads!"—So much for <hi>Lords of
Seſſion.</hi> But let him beware! he will
find them "riſe with gaſhes on their
crowns, to puſh him, and others too,
perhaps, from their ſtools." Like the
viſion in Mr. <hi>Glover's</hi> celebrated bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad
of <hi>Hoſier's Ghoſt,</hi> "A ſad troop
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0586200600:12"/>
will appear, all ſhrowded in dreary
robes, as winding ſheets, and frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a hoſtile band."</p>
            <p>But indeed, indeed, our country is
at a miſerable ebb, when its great and
good families are totally indifferent
about every public concern, and have
ſo little ſpirit, even as to their private
concerns, that they never advance,
like men, to the fountain head of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but indolently or timidly
ſuffer all to be done by ſome perſon or
other who for the time is brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
or who puts himſelf forward,
as a <hi>miniſter for Scotland.</hi> They are
afraid to let their <hi>natural voice</hi> be
heard by adminiſtration, but muſt
convey their wiſhes through a ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trumpet, which, I will tell them,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0586200600:13"/>
may be pointed high or low, as he
who holds it may think proper. But
if the Stuarts, the Hamiltons, the
Erſkines, the Craufurds, the Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomeries,
the Douglaſes, the Grahams,
the Somervilles, the Cathcarts, the
Kennedies, in ſhort, all the men of
blood and of property, who ought to
be men of conſequence, hang back,
are we to be ſurprized that admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
appoints a <hi>locum tenens,</hi> an
agent, or by whatever name he may
be called; or that ſome able and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
politician takes their place. I
remember <hi>Archibald</hi> duke of <hi>Argyll</hi>
—I remember <hi>Stuart Mackenzie</hi>—I
remember <hi>Gilmour,</hi> all in their turn,
<hi>bowed</hi> to, and bringing the people
of Scotland to St. James's and the
Treaſury, as a ſaleſman drives black
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0586200600:14"/>
cattle to Smithfield. Poor dumb
beaſts! why ſhould they not walk up
themſelves, and bellow as they may
incline?</p>
            <q>
               <l>I'll bellow out for Rome, and for my country,</l>
               <l>And mouth at Caeſar till I ſhake the Senate.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Then came Mr. <hi>Henry Dundas,</hi>
who has made a diſtinguiſhed figure
at more markets than one—whether
at <hi>Oxford</hi> market with Lord <hi>North,</hi>
or <hi>Leadenhall</hi> market with Mr. <hi>Pitt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a time when we were
flattered there was to be no monopoly
—when that TITUS, that <hi>Deliciae hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani
generis,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Portland</hi>
(I give his Grace as Mr. Burke gave
him me, not having the good fortune
to be known to him) when <hi>He</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided.
—O, then! all was to go well
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0586200600:15"/>
with Scotland!—There was to be no
go-between—nobody to keep back
the individuals of that diſtant part of
the iſland from fairly aſſerting their
pretenſions, whether from birth,
wealth, or merit. But, alas! we ſoon
found there was only a <hi>change of
Dundaſes.</hi> Inſtead of Mr. <hi>Henry
Dundas,</hi> we got Sir <hi>Thomas Dundas;</hi>
and now we have Mr. <hi>Henry Dundas</hi>
again.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dundas is of a great law race.
The family of <hi>Arniſton</hi> has for four
ſucceſſive generations been judges in
our ſupreme civil court, and for theſe
two laſt been at the head of it as
Preſident.—A very extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
in modern times, where it can
be ſaid, <hi>per faſces numerat avos.</hi>
Why then, O why! Mr. Dundas,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0586200600:16"/>
ſhould <hi>you</hi> attempt to injure this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
inſtitution? Are you not afraid
that the ſhades of your anceſtors may
diſturb your pillow? "Be not too
bold," I intreat you! There are
ſome things which we will bear, and
ſome things which we will <hi>not</hi> bear.
Think, O think of
<q>"Vaulting Ambition, which o'erleaps itſelf!"</q>
Beſides, Sir, you are the Dean of the
Faculty of Advocates. We have placed
you in the chair where LOCKHART
ſat: we expect you will not betray
us.</p>
            <p>But, that I may now ſpeak to my
countrymen in plain, and, I flatter
myſelf, convincing argument, let us
conſider the peculiar form and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Court of Seſſion. It
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0586200600:17"/>
will hardly be believed, in <hi>England,</hi>
that we have no juries in civil cauſes;
ſtill more ſtrange will it ſeem, that
we once had that ineſtimable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
and loſt it—nobody can tell how.
But Lord <hi>Kames</hi> has proved it.—That
a country ſhould, in the progreſs of
civilization in every other reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more barbarous in its executive
juriſprudence, is a wonderful and a
diſgraceful phaenomenon. Nay, we
have no grand jury in Scotland. There
is no ſuch thing as finding a bill by
the country: all criminal proſecutions
are by <hi>information</hi> of the firſt crown
lawyer, or by immediate indictment
at the ſuit of private perſons, with his
concurrence; ſo that there is neither
the ſecurity againſt unjuſt proſecutions
which the verdict of our peers would
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0586200600:18"/>
afford, nor is there a certainty that
crimes which <hi>ought</hi> to be proſecuted
<hi>will</hi> be proſecuted. All is left to the
will and pleaſure of <hi>His Majeſty's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi>
the Attorney-General of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that anomalous perſonage whoſe
<hi>ſtatus</hi> puzzles the Houſe of Commons;
who is a <hi>lord,</hi> but yet not <hi>noble,</hi> and
to-morrow may deſcend to be only
the honourable, or aſcend to be the
right honourable, <hi>gentleman.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Plac'd on this iſthmus of a middle ſtate,</l>
               <l>A being darkly wiſe, and rudely great.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Lord Advocate of Scotland
has the whole power of a grand jury
in his perſon. The fat Mr. <hi>Edward
Bright,</hi> of Malden, whoſe print is in
all our inns to amuſe the weary tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
is nothing to the <hi>learned lord.</hi>
—<hi>He</hi> could button ſeven men in his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0586200600:19"/>
waiſtcoat; but the learned lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
hundreds: the grand juries
of thirty counties are packed within
his little circumference.</p>
            <p>The Court of Seſſion then is not
only a body of <hi>judges,</hi> but, like the
Parliament of Paris, it is a ſtanding
<hi>jury</hi> for all Scotland. And will it
be ſeriouſly maintained, that <hi>fifteen</hi> is
too large a number, when that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered?
My amiable and honourable
friend <hi>Dempſter,</hi> that <hi>rara avis</hi> of
the Scottiſh breed, who has ſat in
parliament almoſt as long as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
moſt gracious Sovereign has ſat
upon the throne, and has ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
uniformly independent, uniformly
benevolent, when I talked to him
upon this ſubject, exclaimed, <q>Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0586200600:20"/>
too few! I would rather have
fifty. They talk of there being
only twelve judges in England: I
ſay there are twenty thouſand—the
juries—by whom almoſt every
thing is decided; and our fifteen
Lords of Seſſion are all we have
for a jury in civil cauſes.</q>—Nobly
ſaid! There <hi>are</hi> twenty thouſand
judges in England—<hi>judges of law as
well as of fact</hi>—and I hope in GOD
there ever ſhall be, notwithſtanding
all that the old Conjuror or any of
his pupils can do. While a <hi>Loft</hi> and
a <hi>Towers</hi> can write, and a <hi>Lee</hi> and
an <hi>Erſkine</hi> plead, that ſacred palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
will be preſerved.</p>
            <p>If the Britiſh Parliament will give
us a grand jury, and juries in civil
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0586200600:21"/>
cauſes (for both of which, if I am
ever thought worthy of being ſent
into the Houſe of Commons as an
independent gentleman, I ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
move for leave to bring in a
bill) I will anſwer for it that the
people of Scotland (when deliberately
conſulted—as they ought to be, in
juſtice, in propriety, and in common
decency) will cheerfully agree to have
the number of the Lords of Seſſion
diminiſhed, becauſe they would <hi>then</hi>
have ſomething better than their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ariſtocratical court. And with
exultation I can tell, that, ſo far as
the people of Scotland <hi>can</hi>—in the
limited privilege of Juries which they
have—they do now exerciſe their
conſtitutional right in its full extent.
We have a <hi>Smellie,</hi> who has, with a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0586200600:22"/>
calm but an undaunted ſpirit, pointed
it out to his fellow citizens in a well
written diſcourſe; and a few months
ago <hi>William Spence,</hi> a young matroſs,
for whom I was counſel, was indicted
by the Lord Advocate for felonious
<hi>fire-raiſing.</hi> He was proſecuted by
his lordſhip in perſon, with all his
addreſs; and the Lord Juſtice Clerk,
the Vice Preſident, of the High
Court of Juſticiary, gave a charge,
with all his his ability, to find him
guilty. But a reſpectable jury ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
him; and, <hi>as I hope for
mercy from the Judge of all the earth,</hi>
had I been one of their number, I
ſhould have been clear to join in the
verdict. I will give up my own
opinion to no human authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0586200600:23"/>
In the preſent form and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Court of Seſſion, there
is occaſion for at leaſt the full number
of judges which were at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and which has remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diminiſhed
now for <hi>two hundred and
fifty three years.</hi> It is remarkable
that when James V. inſtituted the
court, the number of the judges was
thought ſmall. Take the words of
<bibl>
                  <hi>Buchanan Hiſt.</hi> lib. 14. cap. 32.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Joannes Dux Albinus, a pontifice
Romano impetravit, ut ſumma pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniae
annua quanta ſatis eſſet ad</hi>
paucorum <hi>judicum ſalarium ſolven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
imperaretur eccleſiaſtico ordini
univerſo, a ſinguliſque pro modò,
cenſus exigeretur.</hi>
               </q> He tells us, it
was difficult to obtain money for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries
even to thoſe <hi>few;</hi> ſo much
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0586200600:24"/>
ſtronger <hi>then</hi> too was the love of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
than the love of juſtice—and he
ſternly delivers his opinion that the
inſtitution did not produce the good
that was expected from it: <q>
                  <hi>Omnium
civium bona</hi> quindecim <hi>hominum
arbitrio ſunt commiſſa, quibus et
perpetua eſt poteſtas, et imperium
plane tyrannicum.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>perpetua poteſtas</hi> is the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a <hi>ſtanding jury;</hi> and the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium
plane tyrannicum</hi> muſt, in the
nature of things, reſide in a body of
men who poſſeſs at once the province
of judge and of jury; nay of common
law judges and equity judges; who
are both King's Bench and Chancery,
and whoſe deciſions therefore may be a
compound of law and of fact and of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0586200600:25"/>
equity, as its members may be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
moved.</p>
            <p>It is this which makes it of infinite
conſequence to us to preſerve all the
judges we have, as long as the court
retains the ſame conſtitution; for it
has been found in practice, that,
notwithſtanding the ſtaggering objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to it in theory, this ſame court
of fifteen has been ſo balanced and
mixed, and tempered and mellowed,
by the workings of various qualities,
in the courſe of time, that upon the
whole it has done very well.</p>
            <p>There may, to be ſure, come a
DOUGLAS CAUSE, which is too vaſt an
object for the throw of ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
die. <hi>Non noſtrum eſt tantas
componere lites.</hi> That is not much;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0586200600:26"/>
becauſe for great cauſes we have an
appeal to that auguſt tribunal, the
Houſe of Lords. But, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of an appeal is more than the
value of almoſt every cauſe that the
court of ſeſſion decides, the right of
appeal is nothing to the greateſt
number of our ſuitors.—We are
therefore concerned that <hi>Innovation</hi>
ſhould be prevented, as we may fear,
but cannot foreſee its effects, and as
the <hi>imperium</hi> of the court would be
ſtill more <hi>tyrannicum</hi> in ten than in
fifteen, as ſpirits have more force as
they are more compreſſed by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Our anceſtors took care to have it
ſolemnly ſtipulated in the 19<hi>th article
of the Union,</hi> 
               <q>That the <hi>Court of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0586200600:27"/>
Seſſion,</hi> or College of Juſtice, do,
after the Union, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, <hi>remain in all time
coming,</hi> within Scotland, <hi>as it is
now conſtituted</hi> by the laws of that
kingdom, and with the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and privileges as before the
Union, ſubject nevertheleſs to ſuch
<hi>regulations, for the better admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Juſtice,</hi> as ſhall be made
by the Parliament of Great-Britain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, think you, by any
artifice of words, by any little quirk
of any ſort, to explain away this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and to maintain that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
power to <hi>make regulations for
the better adminiſtration of juſtice,</hi> in a
<hi>court</hi> which is to <hi>remain in all time
coming as now conſtituted,</hi> ſhall be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0586200600:28"/>
underſtood to give a licence to deſtroy
that very court itſelf, by <hi>changing</hi> its
<hi>conſtitution?</hi> Is a court of <hi>ten</hi> the
ſame with a court of <hi>fifteen?</hi> Is a <hi>two-legged</hi>
animal the ſame with a <hi>four-legged</hi>
animal? I know nobody who
will gravely defend that propoſition,
except one groteſque 'philoſopher,
whom ludicrous <hi>fable</hi> repreſents as
going about avowing his hunger, and
wagging his tail, fain to become can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,
and eat his deceaſed brethren.
It is <hi>clear,</hi> that the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> muſt be
preſerved, though the <hi>accidents</hi> may
be varied. The <hi>Court of Seſſion,</hi> the
<hi>Quindecem Homines,</hi> muſt remain,
unleſs <hi>by conſent of the people of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
themſelves,</hi> though the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the court, the modes of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrating
juſtice by thoſe <hi>fifteen,</hi> may
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0586200600:29"/>
be regulated occaſionally, as the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Parliament, in its great wiſdom,
ſhall ſee fit. If any man can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a doubt of <hi>this,</hi> if he is capable
of having his underſtanding ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
I cannot argue with him.</p>
            <p>Is it a light matter then to infringe
the <hi>Articles of the Union?</hi>—My coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,
hear me! I accoſt you with a
warning voice.—Have a care!—I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
do fairly acknowledge that I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
and love the ancient Hierarchy,
though, like <hi>Whitefield,</hi> of whoſe
pious and animated ſociety I had ſome
ſhare, I can communicate with all
ſincere Chriſtians. But you in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
think differently, and your <hi>kirk,</hi>
your Preſbyterian eſtabliſhment, ſtands
juſt upon the ſame ground of ſecurity
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0586200600:30"/>
that the Court of Seſſion does. No
doubt it may be aboliſhed by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
conſent, or by conſent of a majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>the people of Scotland;</hi> for that
is my firm opinion of the import of
the articles of the Union. But the
<hi>Britiſh Parliament</hi> cannot aboliſh it;
for the Britiſh Parliament <hi>ſits under
thoſe very articles,</hi> and is limited by
them. But, once yield the <hi>principle,</hi>
were it in the ſmalleſt iota, and there
is an end of your ſecurity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take leave to preſs upon you
the apprehenſion of what I believe we
ſhall all agree in reſiſting; I mean
that, if the articles of Union ſhould
be infringed, there might then moſt
probably be a prodigious <hi>innovation</hi>
in our <hi>land-tax.</hi> And this concerns
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0586200600:31"/>
not <hi>Scotland</hi> alone.—My lords and
gentlemen of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> counties,
where the land-tax is low, <hi>on you I
call.</hi> If Innovation is thus to ſtride
at large, the <hi>equalizing ſyſtem</hi> may be
extended: and let me tell you, it is
not <hi>you</hi> that can prevent it. You are
too few. It is to <hi>Scotland</hi> you owe
your ſafety. Government at preſent
<hi>dare</hi> not equalize the land-tax. <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
would riſe to a man, and aſſert
the articles of the Union. But the
<hi>praefervidum ingenium Scotorum</hi> may
be ſubdued.—There is a melancholy
gradation in the old ſong of <hi>Waly,
waly, up the bank:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>I leaned my back unto an oak,</l>
               <l>I thought it had been a truſty tree;</l>
               <l>But firſt it <hi>bowed,</hi> and then it <hi>brake,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And ſo did my true love to me.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0586200600:32"/>
Let not the Scottiſh ſpirit be bowed.
Let LOWTHER come forth, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
us! We are his neighbours.
<hi>Paries proximus ardet.</hi> We all know
what HE can do: HE upon whom
the thouſands of <hi>Whitehaven</hi> depend
for three of the elements: HE whoſe
ſoul is all great—whoſe reſentment is
terrible; but whoſe liberality is
boundleſs. I know that he is digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
by having hoſts of enemies.
But I have fixed his character in my
mind upon no ſlight inquiry. I have
traverſed <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
I have ſojourned at <hi>Carliſle</hi> and
at <hi>Kendal:</hi> I know of the LONSDALE

               <hi>Innovation</hi> is, in my mind, a very
perilous experiment. I reſpect the
ancient Barons for their <hi>Nolumus leges
Angliae mutari;</hi> and now that <hi>Dr.
Johnſon</hi> is gone to a bettr world, I
bow the intellectual knee to <hi>Lord
Thurlow,</hi> who, with inflexible wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſtops the tide of faſhionable
reform. It was <hi>Johnſon</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
me in my opinion of that
mighty Sage of the law and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
Before his promotion to
the high office, for which he ſeems to
have been formed on purpoſe, the
Doctor ſaid of him, <q>I honour <hi>Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
Sir.—<hi>Thurlow</hi> is a fine fellow!
He fairly puts his mind to your's.</q>—
Long, long may he put his mind
againſt thoſe who would take even
one ſtone out of that venerable

fabrick, which is the wonder of the
world!</p>
            <p>Miſtake me not, my countrymen,
as if I had changed my opinion
againſt the <hi>nominal and fictitious votes</hi>
in our counties! <hi>Theſe</hi> are no part

Theſe will, I hope—theſe <hi>ſhall</hi> be

guard the conſtitution, I would ſweep
from it the cobwebs, with all their

            <p>
               <hi>Innovation</hi> frightens me, becauſe I
never can be ſure what will come
next. <q>Hitherto ſhalt thou come,
but no further; and here ſhall thy
proud waves be ſtayed!</q> is not for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0586200600:35"/>
mortals to ſay. My Lord <hi>March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
did me the honour of a viſit a
few years ago, and made a remark,
which ſtill vibrates in my ear: <q>Sir,
this country has been governed by
wiſe men; and we have had no
notion what miſchief fools could
do.</q>—At another time, talking of
this very ſubject of leſſening the
number of judges in Scotland, which
has been formerly mooted, his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſaid, <q>No. It muſt not be.
Scotland is far from the ſun of
government, and muſt be lighted
by many luſtres!</q>—
<q>
                  <l>"There the bright flame was ſhot through Marchmont's foul!"</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent attempt puts me in
mind of one of the many good ſtories
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0586200600:36"/>
which I have heard my father tell.—
An Earl of <hi>Seaforth</hi> took it into his
head that he would pull down <hi>Bran</hi>
caſtle, the ancient ſeat of his family.
The <hi>clan</hi> was alarmed. The <hi>caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fey</hi>
(the deer's head, the creſt of the
Mackenzie's) was diſplayed. The
brave <hi>Mackenzies</hi> took fire, aſſembled,
and came to him in a body. <q>My
lord, this ſhall not be! Wiſer men
than you built this caſtle! You
ſhall not demoliſh it!</q>—<hi>There</hi> was
the true ſpirit of clanſhip: not a
ſlaviſh ſubjection to an individual;
but a voluntary attachment to their
patriarchal father and lord—to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
—to the throne.</p>
            <p>I abhor annihilation—and five of
our judges ſhall not periſh, if I can
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0586200600:37"/>
prevent it.—What, in the name of
goodneſs, is the motive to this violent
meaſure? Does the country com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that there are too many judges?
No.—Do the judges themſelves
complain? I truſt, No.—For what,
I pray you, is the Court of Seſſion?
Why, it is an aggregate of <hi>fourteen</hi>
ſeparate and diſtinct ſubordinate
courts, and one Court of Appeal.
There are fourteen <hi>ordinary lords:</hi>
Each of theſe has his own roll of
cauſes, in one half of which his
judgement is allowed to be final.
The Court of Appeal is the whole
body of thoſe <hi>Lord Ordinaries,</hi> with
the Lord Preſident at their head;
and this Court of Appeal ſits five
days in the week to review judgments
of the <hi>Ordinaries.</hi>—Now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0586200600:38"/>
how buſineſs is done in this
court, or, more properly ſpeaking,
in theſe courts. It is done chiefly in
writing, and moſt voluminous writing
it is: there are <hi>minutes, repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
anſwers, replies, duplies, triplies,
memorials hinc inde—cum multis aliis,
que nunc</hi> perſcribere <hi>longum eſt;</hi> ſo
that each <hi>proceſs</hi> (as the papers in a
ſuit are called) makes a thick bundle,
which is carried to the judge's houſe;
and this he muſt peruſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
put his <hi>interlocutor</hi> upon it in
writing, and authenticate it by his
ſubſcription. Now I <hi>know,</hi> and every
man acquainted with the court knows,
and <hi>it can be proved by all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the College of Juſtice,</hi> that it
is with the utmoſt difficulty that even
the fourteen judges whom we have,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0586200600:39"/>
can get through the buſineſs with
reaſonable diſpatch. How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
then that it can be done by a
third fewer people, be they ever ſo
laborious? Nine Dukes of <hi>Richmond</hi>
could not do it.</p>
            <p>I could ſee ſome meaning in dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
the <hi>Court of Review,</hi> and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
only the <hi>ten</hi> ſenior judges, or
perhaps the <hi>five</hi> ſenior judges, ſit in
the <hi>Inner Houſe,</hi> that the Court of
Review might move quicker, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leſs unwieldy, and the other
judges might have more time to ripen
and decide cauſes in the firſt inſtance,
which is the moſt laborious part of
the buſineſs. <hi>That</hi> I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
as coming within the power
conceded, in the articles of Union, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0586200600:40"/>
make <hi>regulations.</hi> But to make <q>the
labourers few, when the harveſt
truly is great,</q> ſeems to me to be
very ſtrange policy.</p>
            <p>And here I have an <hi>argumentum
ad homines.</hi> I <hi>will not believe</hi> that
the Lords of Seſſion themſelves are ſo
unconſcientious as to approve of this
meaſure, though <hi>Rumour,</hi> with all
her tongues, has wantonly ſaid they
are for it. My argument is this:—
There is not one of them who has
not, again and again, ſaid, what I
have juſt now ſtated, that the duty
of his office is very great, and that in
ſeſſion-time he is quite harraſſed, he
has ſo much to do.—Will they then
undertake to do more, that they may
get a little more money? I hope not.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0586200600:41"/>
As it muſt be <hi>ſure</hi> that they are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
innocent</hi> of ſo heavy a charge, I
may put it in ſtrong words—<q>Either
they <hi>have</hi> been <hi>liars;</hi> or, They
<hi>mean</hi> to be <hi>cheats.</hi>
               </q> That is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
charge which their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of leſſening their number, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leſſening or ſhortening the buſineſs
of the court, would involve.—I beg
ten thouſand pardons for even utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch coarſe epithets; but my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
is rouſed, that any creature
whatever ſhould have the audacity
to impute to the judges of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſo abominable an alternative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quid non mortalia pectora cogis auri
ſacra fames?</hi> is an exclamation which
keeps pace with mankind, from age
to age. But, ſurely, we ought to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0586200600:42"/>
ſuppoſe judges have learnt better
things, and have extirpated from
their hallowed breaſts, <q>
                  <hi>the root of
all evil.</hi>
               </q>—How injurious is it to
imagine they will be like ſome impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ſluts, who, for more wages,
will undertake to be both cookmaid
and chambermaid—<hi>Delicate coalition!</hi>
—The Lords of Seſſion are, or ſhould
be, Gentlemen. Shall we make them
a parcel of <hi>Scrubs?</hi>—<q>Of a Monday I
drive the coach; of a Tueſday I drive
the plough; on a Wedneſday I follow
the hounds; a Thurſday I dun the
tenants; on Friday I go to market;
on Saturday I draw warrants; and
a Sunday I draw beer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe it ſhould be thought right
to increaſe the ſalaries of the Lords of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0586200600:43"/>
Seſſion; is there no way of doing it
but making two-thirds of them devour
the reſt, like Pharaoh's lean and fat
kine? Is the ſtate ſo poor, that we
muſt adopt a meaſure ſimilar to the
barbarous permiſſion in China and
Otaheite, to murder their children,
leſt they ſhould not have food
enough? Six thouſand pounds a
year would make them up £1000
each; and cannot that miſerable ſum
be ſpared off ſome corner of the ſine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
eſtabliſhment? I perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that the people of Scotland them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
would ſubmit to a <hi>cenſus,</hi> in
order to ranſom their court. If the
Judges are poor, let them hold out
<hi>the Mendicant pouch,</hi> and receive our
<hi>benevolence!</hi> I, for one, would cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
pay my <hi>quota,</hi> rather than ſuffer
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0586200600:44"/>
ſo dangerous an amputation to be
botchingly performed upon our old
judicial body.</p>
            <p>But is it quite clear that there
ſhould be an augmentation of their
ſalaries? The Lord Preſident has
already £1400 a year: every Ordinary
Lord has better than <hi>ſix hundred gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas;</hi>
and ſix of their number are alſo
Lords of Juſticiary, of whom the
Lord Juſtice Clerk has £400 a year,
and each of the other five has £200
a year. Beſides, every one of thoſe
ſix is allowed £300 a year for circuit
expences; and now that they have
obtained an act of Parliament, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to ſtay only three days at
each aſſize-town inſtead of ſix, as they
were formerly obliged to do (<hi>while the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0586200600:45"/>
ſame allowance for expences is quietly
continued)</hi> they have, upon my word,
very comfortable proviſions. The
Juſticiary gown is an excellent object
of ambition, and an encouragement
for laudable exertion to the Ordinary
Lords. But even without that, they
have a very decent premium from the
ſtate, and may live very well in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as judges ſhould live; <q>not in
rioting and drunkenneſs,</q> indeed,
but in grave abſtraction, as becomes
their office. Dr. <hi>South's</hi> pulpit joke,
upon the wages of ſin being death—
<q>Poor wages, that a man cannot live
by</q>—will not, in my opinion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to <hi>all</hi> offices. The ſtate, in many
caſes, is only to help a man to live;
not wholly to ſupport him. The
ſtate ſhould enable him fully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0586200600:46"/>
the additional expence occaſioned
by the office which he holds: but he
is a hungry hound indeed, who comes
into an office of reſpect and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ſuch as that of a judge, with
nothing at all of his own, neither fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
eſtate, nor fortune acquired by
practice. I own I ſhould think a
man in ſuch circumſtances ought not
to be made a judge: either his birth
muſt be mean—his abilities ſmall—
or his conduct imprudent.</p>
            <p>Were there a difficulty to find men
of merit willing to be made Lords of
Seſſion, by reaſon of the ſalary being
too ſmall, I could underſtand this
<hi>procruſtian</hi> expedient: but let us at
leaſt wait till that is the caſe, which,
well Mr. <hi>Dundas</hi> knows, it is not as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0586200600:47"/>
yet, by any means. Will he tell me
that the ſalary of that office is not
ſufficiently conſiderable, for which
Mr. <hi>Alexander Gordon,</hi> brother to the
Earl of Aberdeen, uncle to the Duke
of Gordon, and a man of good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
experience, and integrity,
ſolicited for years, and—<hi>pudet haec
opprobria!</hi> might perhaps have been
ſoliciting ſtill, had not a political
wave, in the tempeſt of laſt year,
thrown him into port.—An office de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
by Mr. <hi>John Maclaurin (filius
Colini fama ſuper</hi> aethera <hi>noti,</hi> and a
ſon of no common talents).—An office
which would be accepted by Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Nairne,</hi> our Vice-Dean, whoſe
character truly exhibits a heaven-born
judge.—An office which would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
which would ſatisfy, Mr. <hi>George
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0586200600:48"/>
Wallace,</hi> whoſe knowledge, applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and honeſty, none will deny;
whom Lord <hi>Mansfield</hi> has praiſed,
but not promoted. <hi>Laudatur et
alget.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could with pleaſure give a long
liſt of my deſerving brethren. To us,
it is <hi>not fair.</hi> It is <hi>unjuſt</hi> to leſſen the
number of prizes after the lottery has
begun drawing; after we, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive
education, and much time
and labour, have purchaſed our tickets,
in the faith that our chance for a prize
is to be what it ever has been. As
for myſelf, I do moſt certainly believe
that I am now writing from pure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
becauſe I have at preſent no wiſh
for the ſerious and important office of
a Lord of Seſſion. I have a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0586200600:49"/>
(perhaps too great a confidence)
in my abilities; and therefore will try
my fortune, for ſome time at leaſt, in
a wider ſphere. But this I declare,
that though the ſituation ſeems to me
too confined, I never thought the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
too ſmall.</p>
            <p>Let us be cautious of augmenting
the ſalaries of our judges. Judges,
like men of genius and learning,
<hi>nutriendi ſunt non ſaginandi.</hi>—A <hi>gown</hi>
in Scotland ſhould not be too good a
<hi>place,</hi> leſt it become altogether an
object of political preferment. We
have already ſeveral noble lords who
are of the Faculty of Advocates, and
who might perhaps condeſcend to
take ſuch a loaf. Lord <hi>Salton</hi> might
think it a <hi>ſnug thing.</hi> My couſin,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0586200600:50"/>
Lord <hi>Cathcart,</hi> might ſee it to be
<hi>better than a regiment.</hi> Lord <hi>Stair</hi>
might <hi>add</hi> it to his <hi>finances.</hi> Lord
<hi>Caſſillis</hi> might chuſe it by way of
<hi>otium cum dignitate.</hi>—And the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
whom I have mentioned, with
an <hi>Erſkine,</hi> a <hi>Blair,</hi> an <hi>Abercrombie,</hi>
a <hi>Grant,</hi> a <hi>Cullen,</hi> and all the reſt
who have honourably borne the heat
of the day, might languiſh and die,
without ever obtaining that rank to
which they will in juſtice be entitled.</p>
            <p>Take the Scottiſh Bench as it is
now endowed—take it in a pecuniary
view: It is a <hi>tontine</hi> for our ſons. In
no country in Europe, but Scotland,
is the profeſſion of the law an <hi>etat,</hi> a
rank. Many a gentleman with us
enters advocate merely to have a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0586200600:51"/>
in his cap. The prime ſociety
of Edinburgh, is lawyers. <hi>They</hi>
give the tone, as, <hi>arbitri elegantiarum,
they</hi> rule the theatre. <hi>They</hi> make
balls for the ladies; and once (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to ſhew the prodigious extent of
their power) they let the nation know
that they could proſcribe even a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Ducheſs, the very ſoul of gay feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.
<hi>Black, law black,</hi> is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
dreſs of the gentlemen of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
by choice, as at Geneva and
Lucca, by an oeconomical regulation
of the ſtate, a ſumptuary law: and
hence, when <hi>Foote</hi> was amongſt us, he
uſed to call <hi>black</hi> the <hi>Edinburgh hunt.</hi>
It exalts our gentlemen to think they
may be judges, as, by calculation, it
has been found that there are two
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0586200600:52"/>
vacancies for every three years. They
are continually looking upwards.</p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>I muſt ſpeak plain, and ſay, that
I fear this crude ſcheme of diminiſhing
the number of the Lords of Seſſion
has ſomething in it more dangerous
than you are aware of. <q>More is
meant than meets the ear.</q> A
politician's luſt of power is exorbitant.
If he can but have the ſupreme tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of Scotland of his own forming,
what may he not do? To ſay nothing
of our <hi>property,</hi> it is now very well
underſtood that the whole <hi>political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
of Scotland is in the hands of
the Lords of Seſſion; for they aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the validity of all the votes,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0586200600:53"/>
whether in our counties or in our
boroughs: and when we afterwards
bring our conteſted elections before a
committee of the Houſe of Commons,
we have the mortification to find that
Mr. <hi>Grenville's</hi> bill is to us, on the
north of the Tweed, as if it were not.
In vain do we plead, in vain do we
preſs upon the committee, the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the groſs iniquity, of an <hi>interlocutor.</hi>
A reſolute <hi>Caledonian Nominee</hi> tells
them the caſe has been decided by
the <hi>only competent court,</hi> which ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
have inveſted with the excluſive
power of trying votes;—and honeſt
<hi>John Bull</hi> believes this, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſces,
never conſidering that the great
law of parliament, the inherent right
of the Houſe of Commons to judge
of the qualifications of its own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0586200600:54"/>
muſt ever be paramount to the
juriſdiction of particular ſubordinate
courts.—I am ſorry, Mr. <hi>George Byng,</hi>
that I cannot appeal to you, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as a Member of Parliament, for
the truth of what I am maintaining:
For though I differ from you, in my
political creed, as far as the eaſt is
from the weſt, I think you an uſeful
and active watchman of the ſtate.
And I am never unmindful of your
civility to me, as a counſel, when you
ſat Chairman of the Ayrſhire Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.
But you may tell your friends
who are in parliament; and Meſſieurs
<hi>Dudley Long, Praed, Bankes, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe,</hi>
and ſeveral more who were of
that committee, will remember the
piteous tale.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0586200600:55"/>
I ſhould oppoſe any diminution
whatever of the number of the Lords
of Seſſion, becauſe it would make "the
law's delay" be more grievouſly felt:
but, above all, I diſlike this particular
plot, to revive the <hi>Decemviri.</hi> It is
<hi>ominous.</hi> In the words of <hi>Livy</hi> I will
ſay, <q>
                  <hi>Non placere nomen; periculoſum

               <hi>Who</hi> ſeconded the King's Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate's
motion for leave to bring in
this bill—this odious bill of pains
and penalties?—It was Sir <hi>Adam Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſſon;</hi>
a man who has vexed me
not a little, by his political ſucceſs in
our county, againſt my wiſhes. He is
one whom Mr. Dundas has ſelected to

               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0586200600:56"/>
Do any of you want to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of Mr. Henry Dundas's
power? I dare ſay not. Care is
taken that its full extent ſhall be
proclaimed as far as <hi>Orkney.</hi> Yet
let us contemplate a ſtriking inſtance;
it would make a picture for the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
or a ſcene at <hi>Aſtley's.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
him in your Metropolis, which
the death of Sir <hi>Lawrence Dundas</hi>
left open to him.—With his <hi>right</hi>
hand he has moved the LORD PROVOST,
<hi>Hunter Blair</hi> (gold chain and all)
from his political baſe.—With his <hi>left,</hi>
he has thruſt in as <hi>repreſentative of the
citizens of Edinburgh</hi>—Whom?—a
reſpectable merchant? No.—A proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
tradeſman? No.—A <hi>Coutts,</hi>
the father of the great eſtabliſhment
in the Strand, London? No.—A <hi>Kerr,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0586200600:57"/>
whom <hi>Pelham</hi> loved? No.—A citizen
of any ſort, good, bad, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent?
No. No. No.—Whom then?
Why Sir <hi>Adam Ferguſſon, advocate,</hi>
the <hi>late</hi> member for the <hi>county of
Ayr!</hi> Sir Adam Ferguſſon wrote a
circular letter againſt peers interfering
in our county election, and ſeveral
very worthy gentlemen joined the
ſtandard of <hi>independency,</hi> as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
which he erected. Carrying
them along with him, and yet
"having his peers as well as we,"
he contrived to poſſeſs, for two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
the repreſentation of Ayr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
by means of <hi>thoſe ſuperiority
votes,</hi> which that county has declared
to be <hi>nominal and fictitious,</hi> while
the REAL INTEREST was unrepreſented.
Sir Adam Ferguſſon laſt year, <hi>as we
are told,</hi> made overtures to the <hi>Earl
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0586200600:58"/>
of Eglintoune,</hi> and formed a <hi>coalition</hi>
with his lordſhip. That he was <hi>not
elected,</hi> we <hi>know;</hi> that he <hi>voted for
his former opponent,</hi> we <hi>know;</hi> and <hi>it
is ſaid</hi> he ſupports the earl's friend
for one parliament, and the earl is to
make him member next parliament<note n="*" place="bottom">When the report of this curious agreement burſt upon the county, like a bomb, and ſtunned men of all parties, I made the following Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's rhimes, to uſher in my friend Colonel Hugh Montgomerie as our repreſentative:
<lg>
                     <l>Adam, too long you've kept your ſeat,</l>
                     <l>With little for your pains;</l>
                     <l>Truſt me, <hi>you'll</hi> never make ends meet,</l>
                     <l>Computing loſs and gains.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Surrender then to gallant Hugh;</l>
                     <l>It truly will be beſt!</l>
                     <l>Bring your mock votes along with you,</l>
                     <l>And laugh at all the reſt.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Thus Ayrſhire yet may proſperous be,</l>
                     <l>With ſuch a brave Commander:</l>
                     <l>And if <hi>you're</hi> pleaſed <hi>our</hi> joy to ſee,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>That</hi> will, <hi>indeed,</hi> be <hi>candour.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </lg>
THE REAL INTEREST.</note>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0586200600:59"/>
—<hi>if he can.</hi> I have never heard his
lordſhip ſay that this report is true:
but if it is, the noble earl muſt not
take it amiſs, if ſome of the beſt
friends of his family ſhould diſdain
what they think degrading to him, and
feel obnoxious to themſelves. Amongſt
thoſe friends, I myſelf am one of the
warmeſt, both as an enthuſiaſt for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
feudal attachments, and as having
the honour and happineſs to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to his lordſhip's relation, a true
<hi>Montgomerie,</hi> whom I eſteem, whom
I love, after fifteen years, as on the
day when ſhe gave me her hand.—
But I have an objection to Sir Adam
Ferguſſon, on account of a paltry
money queſtion, which being now
under the arbitration of three of our
Lords of Seſſion, I forbear to exhibit
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0586200600:60"/>
it, till the reſult is known.—Mr. <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adam,</hi>
of <hi>Craigengillan,</hi> as able and
as ſpirited a man as any in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
dominions, and Sir <hi>John
Whitefoord,</hi> who is honour itſelf,
both gentlemen of extenſive intereſt
in Ayrſhire, have alſo objections to
him, which they have ſtated to me,
and will tell any body who thinks it
worth while to aſk them.—In theſe
circumſtances, the Houſe of Eglin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toune
can hardly expect that the
great county of Ayr, the Yorkſhire of
Scotland, will be brought implicitly
to wheel, and vote for ſir Adam Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſſon,
merely that a bargain, which
ſhould never have been made, may be
fulfilled. I myſelf have reaſon to
hope, that many of the real free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
of Ayrſhire will ſupport me
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0586200600:61"/>
at the election for next parliament,
againſt which I have declared myſelf
a candidate. Colonel <hi>Montgomerie</hi>
has had the great honour of being
choſen by the real Freeholders. May
I not have it in my turn? <hi>Ed anche
Io ſon pittore.</hi> By the time this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is over, he may be content to
be <q>
                  <hi>Vejanius, armis Herculis ad poſtem
fixis.</hi>
               </q>—I ſhall certainly ſtand, upon
the ſubſtantial intereſt of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of landed property; and if, upon
a fair trial, I ſhould not ſucceed in
<q>that object of ambition, which I
have moſt ardently at heart,</q> I have
reſources enough to prevent me from
being diſcontented or fretful. Perhaps
Sir Adam Ferguſſon may ſupport me.
Why ſhould he not? I know of no
objection the honourable baronet can
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0586200600:62"/>
have to me, though I am ſorry that
I have an objection to the honourable
baronet. I have aſked his vote and
intereſt by a letter. His anſwer has
neither granted nor refuſed my appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
He waves it on the common
civil ground, that it is too ſoon to
decide. In the mean time, I ſhall
endeavour to deſerve the ſupport of
the real freeholders, by exerting my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as much as I poſſibly can, to ſerve
either the county in general, or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
of it; and when a man does
the beſt, he can, he may perhaps,
have his reward. But this country-city
member has led me off from
Edinburgh, to which I now return;
and I do ſay, that, if iſſuing an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<hi>congé d'elire,</hi> by which Sir Adam
Ferguſſon is made member for the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0586200600:63"/>
capital of Scotland, be not power with
a witneſs, I am at a loſs to conceive
what power is.</p>
            <p>As to all this power aſſumed by
Mr. Dundas, I muſt ſay <hi>miror!</hi> But
I certainly do not blame <hi>him.</hi> As <hi>Cato</hi>
ſays, when his gallant ſon <hi>Marcus</hi> is
brought in <hi>dead,</hi> 
               <q>Who would not
be that youth?</q>—The proverb ſays,
<q>A living dog is better than a dead
lion.</q> What then muſt a living lion
be? But under what <hi>genus,</hi> under
what <hi>ſpecies,</hi> are they to be ranked,
whoſe puſillanimity is the cauſe that
this lion alone domineers in the foreſt?
Our late and preſent ſituation brings
to my remembrance ſome verſes in an
old poem, which I have heard my
father repeat: they are a kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0586200600:64"/>
applicable to a <hi>coalition</hi>
which in the laſt age took place in
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">May alſo theſe men of many wiles. <hi>Ambages.</hi>
                  </note> May eke thae men o' mony wimples,</l>
               <l>Sir James and Sir John Dalrymples,</l>

            </q>
            <p>Yet I will do Mr. Dundas the
juſtice to declare, that, large as his
power is, he has not much abuſed it.
He has, indeed, taken very good care
of his relations! And why ſhould he
not? Though, to be ſure, fleſh and
blood muſt feel his having put his
young nephew over the heads of I
know not how many of us, as Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor
General. But I do not believe
that he has been cruel, oppreſſive, or
vindictive. I know but of two wrong
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0586200600:65"/>
things that he has done. One was
attacking Sir Lawrence Dundas in the
county of Orkney, <q>in his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
where he was a father to the
people;</q> as that hoſpitable, that
ſplendid, that imperial baronet, ſaid
to me, with tears in his eyes. The
other was perſuading my honoured
father, a venerable judge, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
of his life, to embark in county
politicks, from which he had ceaſed
for twenty years, and make a parcel of
unſubſtantial votes, which he abhorred,
in order to ſupport Sir Adam Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſſon
in Ayrſhire, againſt the old
and the real intereſt of the county.
But both theſe inſtances were the
effects of <hi>politicks</hi> which I ſee to be
<hi>poiſon to the mind.</hi> I have therefore
no more objection to Mr. Dundas's
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0586200600:66"/>
being ſole <hi>Protector</hi> of Scotland, than
any other man, if we <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo ruled.
Nay, I have an <hi>intereſt</hi> that <hi>he</hi> ſhould
be the perſon. For there is an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
friendſhip between our families.
We were at college together. We
have oft enjoyed
<q>
                  <l>—The "happier hour</l>
                  <l>"Of ſocial pleaſure.—"</l>
               </q>
And I truſt to the generoſity of his
feelings, that, as he <hi>knows</hi> he once did
me a ſevere injury, which I have from
my heart forgiven, he will be anxious
to make me full amends, if ever it
ſhall be in his power. The deſire of
elevation is as keen in me as in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
though I am not ſo well fitted
for party exploits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0586200600:67"/>
As <hi>Nero</hi> wiſhed that the people of
Rome had but one neck, that he
might, if he pleaſed, cut them off at
a ſingle ſtroke.—So a deep, an artful
politician, will be deſirous to contract
the body which he wiſhes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
It is eaſier driving four horſes
in hand than ſix. Beſides, while there
are <hi>fifteen</hi> judges, the danger that they
may not be all tractable is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
multiplied, when compared
with the number <hi>ten.</hi> There may
be a proud, an eloquent <hi>Alemoor,</hi>
who will watch like a dragon;—a
ſturdy <hi>Elliock,</hi> who will not bend;—
a firm <hi>Stonefield,</hi> who not only has
a will of his own, but if one in high
place, truſting that he is ſheltered
in his ſituation, preſumes to be
coarſely inſolent, can tell it him in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0586200600:68"/>
his ear, aye, and to his beard;
—an honourable <hi>Rockville,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of higher rank than any of them,
before he became a judge, will not
ſtoop—will not truckle—will not
be led—but will deliver his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
good ſenſe with the mild dignity
that becomes him.</p>
            <p>It is very agreeable to conſider,
that one bad judge cannot contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
a number who are good, yet,
when we take the converſe of the
propoſition, we ſhall find one good
judge can prevent the evil of many
bad ones. He can hold up truth and
juſtice ſo conſpicuouſly, that bad
judges have not hardineſs enough to
turn aſide from them; and, if they
ſhould, he can alarm the country.

When a man of probity and ſpirit, a
Lord <hi>Newhall,</hi> whoſe character is
ably drawn in proſe by the late Lord
Preſident <hi>Arniſton,</hi> father of the
Treaſurer of the Navy, and elegantly
in verſe by Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Bangour</hi>
—when ſuch a man ſits among our
judges, ſhould they be diſpoſed to do
wrong, he can make them hear and
tremble. My honoured father told
me, that Sir <hi>Walter Pringle</hi> "ſpoke
as one having authority," even when
he was at the bar. "He would cram
a "deciſion down their throats."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Duncan Forbes</hi> of <hi>Culloden,</hi> when
Lord Preſident of the Court, gave
every day as a toaſt, at his table,
<q>Here's to every Lord of Seſſion
who does not deſerve to be hangedl</q>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0586200600:70"/>
Lord <hi>Auchinleck</hi> and Lord <hi>Monboddo,</hi>
both judges, but <hi>ſince his time,</hi> are
my authority for this. I do not ſay
that the toaſt was very delicate, or
even quite decent; but it may give
ſome notion what ſort of judges there
<hi>may</hi> be. It is well known that <hi>Forbes,</hi>
by the ſingle weight of his character,
aſſiduouſly and boldly urged, made a
very great alteration to the better
upon the court, and ſhewed <hi>Unum
Hominem pluris valuiſſe quam Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A number of judges, taken from
different parts of the country, diffuſes
and divides that private and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
influence which muſt ever be
in a narrow country. One prejudice
is checked and counterbalanced by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0586200600:71"/>
another. A judge from the north of
the Tay is corrected by a judge from
the ſouth of the Tay, and is again cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by him, in his turn.—I ſolemnly
declare, I mean no reflection againſt
the Lords of Seſſion, farther than that
they are not exempted from the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
incident to man—that human
nature is human nature every where,
and in a narrow country is more liable
than in a great country, to what I
ſhall call—honeſt bias.</p>
            <p>With a plauſible appearance, it has
been propagated from company to
company, that, were there fewer
Lords of Seſſion, there would be more
ſecurity from their reſponſibility; as
diſgrace, which is light when ſhared
amongſt a number, falls heavy upon
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0586200600:72"/>
a few.—But againſt this you ſhall
have an unanſwerable argument.—
<q>If they are honeſt and honourable
men, they will not be the leſs ſo
that they are <hi>fifteen.</hi> If they are
not, and mean to do wrong, a junto
of <hi>ten</hi> can do it with more facility.</q>
               <hi>Non meus hic ſermo eſt:</hi> I owe it to
Lord <hi>Palmerſton,</hi> from whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
there is always ſomething to
be borrowed. I humbly thank his
lordſhip for it, and beg he may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my imperfect report of it. He
gave it me at Lord <hi>Oſſory's.</hi> I cannot
refrain from mentioning the <hi>place;</hi>
becauſe I am very vain to fit at the
table of <hi>FITZPATRICK:</hi> the reſpect
for whoſe ancient and noble blood is
not leſſened, but increaſed, by the
character of its preſent repreſentative;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0586200600:73"/>
which, as I feel, is ſaying a great deal.
I flatter myſelf FITZPATRICK was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.
If he was—I'll anſwer for
it, all the world ſhall not make him
flinch.</p>
            <p>And now, my countrymen, let me
intreat you to aſſemble again in your
counties, and boroughs, and corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and publick bodies of every
kind, and <hi>petition Parliament</hi> againſt
diminiſhing the number of the Lords
of Seſſion; unleſs Parliament will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
alter the judicial procedure of
Scotland, upon ſome wiſe plan, <hi>after
it has received your approbation.</hi> I
would alſo have you to addreſs the
KING againſt ſo alarming a meaſure.
It is the glory of the reign of
GEORGE III. that he has given inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0586200600:74"/>
to his judges. His Majeſty
will graciouſly liſten to what you
humbly and honeſtly tell him, relative
to what he has much at heart—the
good adminiſtration of juſtice in his
dominions.</p>
            <p>Do not deſpond, and imagine that
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Members of Parliament will
be totally inattentive to what ſo much
concerns you. My old claſſical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
<hi>Wilkes,</hi> (with whom I pray
you to excuſe my keeping company,
he is ſo pleaſant) did indeed once tell
me, when I aſked him to attend a
Scottiſh conteſt in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<q>No, no! Damn it! Not I!
I'll have nothing to do with it! I
care not which prevails! It is only
<hi>Goth</hi> againſt <hi>Goth!</hi>
               </q>—But he is now
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0586200600:75"/>
an older member of the great council
of the nation, and I hope will not
grudge to take a little trouble for you,
by way of <hi>doing penance</hi> for his <hi>biting</hi>
and <hi>ſcratching</hi> in the <hi>North Briton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may hope for aid from the
Lord Rector of the univerſity of Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,
Mr. <hi>Burke,</hi> who diſlikes and
dreads reform in parliament; who
ſpoke this very ſeſſion againſt it like
an angel, and whoſe benignant heart
will feel for your juſt anxiety. To
Mr. Burke I was much obliged when
he was in power; and it grieved me
that he embraced, what in all ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
I thought ſuch a meaſure as juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
his removal from office;—for
his intereſt is dear to me as my own.
By his removal, the King's admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0586200600:76"/>
was deprived of the aſſiſtance
of that affluent mind, which is ſo
univerſally rich, that, as long as Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
literature and Britiſh politicks
ſhall endure, it will be ſaid of <hi>Edmund
Burke, "Regum equabat opes animis.</hi>"</p>
            <p>You will be liſtened to by my gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Colonel <hi>James Wortley Stuart,</hi>
who, for ſterling good ſenſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
diſcernment, honour and
honeſty, and ſpirit, is not exceeded
by any of them. As diminiſhing the
number of our judges would diminiſh
the influence of the Crown, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
will not like it.</p>
            <p>You will be liſtened to by that brave

               <note n="*" place="bottom">I have always ſtood up for the Iriſh, in whoſe fine country I have been hoſpitably and jovially entertained, and with whom I feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be much congenial.

Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> with whom my intimacy has
been chiefly formed ſince I made him
dangle at the end of a rope, as Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

—(What liberality of mind muſt he

of any ſort, in which we
exactly agree. But the general maſs
of ſenſe and ſociality, literature and
religion, in each of us, produces two
given quantities, which unite and
efferveſce wonderfully well. To his
great reputation, as a barriſter, my

The application of this illuſtrious

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0586200600:92"/>
19 of the Treaty of Union, is <hi>not
imaginary.</hi> For, in corrobaration of
the paſſage which I have already tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
I beg leave to add, that,
after ſpecifying the qualifications then
requiſite for Lords of Seſſion, that
ſame article of the Treaty ſays, <q>yet
ſo as the <hi>qualifications</hi> made, or to
be made, for capacitating perſons to
be named Ordinary Lords of Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>may be altered by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Great-Britain.</hi>
               </q> Does not
this make it perfectly clear that the
<hi>conſtitution of</hi> the court may <hi>not</hi> be
altered? <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam, in
caſibus non exceptis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a former part of this letter I
ſuggeſted, as a <hi>regulation</hi> of <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
upon the adminiſtration of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0586200600:93"/>
juſtice in our <hi>unalterable Court of
Seſſion,</hi> that the <hi>ten</hi> ſenior judges, or
only the <hi>five</hi> ſenior judges, ſhould ſit
in the <hi>inner houſe</hi> as the Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.
But it now occurs to me, that
it is not always certain that the oldeſt
judges will be the wiſeſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I would rather have them to ſit
<hi>ſeven</hi> and <hi>ſeven</hi> alternately, with the
Preſident (four with him, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding
judge in his room, to make a
quorum) to review the ſeparate deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Ordinary Lords. Let the
ſuitors have time to make their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of either of thoſe Courts of Seven.
Let the Preſident deliver his opinion,
but have no vote, unleſs where there
happens to be an equality of voices.
And as at preſent no decree is final,
till after two conſecutive judgements
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0586200600:94"/>
of the <hi>inner houſe,</hi> let there, for the
ſecond judgement, be a privilege to
obtain a new trial before the whole
<hi>fifteen,</hi> as at preſent, upon cauſe
ſhewn; and let the whole fifteen ſit
one week in each month for rejecting
or receiving ſuch applications, and
deciding upon them. My ſuggeſtions
are offered with great diffidence: but
they are all <hi>legal:</hi> they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe
the ſacred conſtitution of the
College of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>I have one other circumſtance to
communicate; but it is of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
value. I communicate it with a
mixture of awe and fondneſs.—That
Great Perſonage, who is allowed by
all to have the beſt <hi>memory</hi> of any man
<hi>born a Briton,</hi> and is known, by thoſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0586200600:95"/>
who know him beſt, to have a very
ſound underſtanding, and a very hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
heart, may probably <hi>recollect,</hi>
that, in a converſation with <hi>one of
the moſt zealous Royaliſts of the age,</hi>
he was graciouſly pleaſed to give Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Paoli</hi> the juſt praiſe of <q>putting
law into a people who were lawleſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What barbarous oppreſſion, what
political guilt would it be, in part to
extinguiſh law amongſt a brave peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who have long enjoyed it, and
who agreed to the abolition of their
own government upon the faith of
unalterable articles of Union, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of which they are now at a
great diſtance from the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to which it is not eaſy for their
voice to extend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0586200600:96"/>
This letter, haſtily written upon
the ſpur of the occaſion, is already
too long. Yet allow me, my friends
and countrymen, while I with honeſt
zeal maintain <hi>your</hi> cauſe—allow me
to indulge a little more my <hi>own
egotiſm</hi> and <hi>vanity.</hi> They are the
indigenous plants of my mind: they
diſtinguiſh it. I may prune their
luxuriancy; but I muſt not entirely
clear it of them; For then I ſhould
be no longer "as I am;" and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
there might be ſomething not ſo
good. <hi>Virtus laudata creſcit.—Sume
ſuperbiam queſitam meritis.</hi> I laſt
year claimed the credit of being no
<hi>time-ſerver;</hi> I think I am giving
pretty good proof that I am not ſo
this year neither. Though ambitious,
I am uncorrupted; and I envy not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0586200600:97"/>
high ſituations which are attained by
the want of publick virtue, in men
born without it; or by the proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of publick virtue, in men born
with it. Though power and wealth,
and magnificence, may at firſt dazzle,
and are, I think, moſt deſireable; no
wiſe man will, upon ſober reflection,
envy a ſituation which he feels he
could not enjoy. My Friend (my
<hi>Maecenas Atavis edite regibus</hi>) Lord
<hi>Mountſtuart,</hi> flattered me once very
highly, without intending it.—<q>I
would do any thing for you (ſaid he)
but bring you into parliament; for
I could not be ſure but you might
oppoſe me in ſomething the very
next day.</q>—His lordſhip judged
well. Though I ſhould conſider, with
much attention, the opinion of ſuch
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0586200600:98"/>
a friend—before taking my reſolution;
—moſt certainly I ſhould oppoſe him,
in any meaſure which I was ſatisfied
ought to be oppoſed. I cannot exiſt
with pleaſure, if I have not an honeſt
independence of mind and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
for though no man loves good
eating and drinking, ſimply conſidered,
better than I do—I prefer the broiled
blade-bone of mutton and humble
port of "down-right <hi>Shippen,</hi>" to all
the luxury of all the ſtateſmen who
play the political game all through.</p>
            <p>It is my ſyſtem to regard, in a
publick capacity—meaſures, and not
men; in a private capacity—men,
and not meaſures. I can diſcuſs
topicks of literature, or any other
topicks, with mitred <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0586200600:99"/>
with <hi>Wyndham</hi> of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> with <hi>Capel
Loft,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Kippis,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Price,</hi>
with the Reverend Mr. <hi>John Palmer;</hi>
yet there are points of government in
ſome of them, and points of faith in
others, as to which, had I any
thing to do in the adminiſtration of
this country, I ſhould <q>withſtand
them to the face.</q> I can drink,
I can laugh, I can converſe in, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
good humour, with Whigs, with
Republicans, with Diſſenters, with
Independents, with Quakers, with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravians,
with Jews. They can do me
no harm. My mind is made up.
My principles are fixed. But I would
vote with Tories, and pray with a
Dean and Chapter.</p>
            <p>While I arraign what ſtrikes me as
very wrong in Mr. Henry Dundas,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0586200600:100"/>
and the Lord Advocate, in their
publick conduct, I am ready to meet
them on friendly, but equal terms,
in private. To the Lord Advocate I
am moſt willing to allow all his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
He has riſen to the head of our
bar. No man, with us, ever puſhed
the buſineſs of a lawyer to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that he has done. He has made
it a Peruvian profeſſion: yet he is
free from the ſordidneſs which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
attends thoſe who get a great
deal of money by laborious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
upon every occaſion that I
have known him tried, he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
And he is a very friendly man.
I ſhould be exceedingly ungrateful if
I did not acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>That Mr. Dundas and he ſhould
think of attempting ſuch a bill as this,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0586200600:101"/>
muſt make us wonder, and, for a
moment, ſhew us how weak the
ableſt men are, upon ſome occaſions.
I may, without offence, account for
it, by uſing the very expreſſion of
Mr. Dundas himſelf, when attacking,
at the bar of the Houſe of Lords, a
decree of the Court of Seſſion, in the
caſe of a ſchoolmaſter, where I was
counſel on the other ſide. I can
ſwear to the phraſe.—<q>They have
been ſeized with ſome <hi>infatuation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot allow myſelf to imagine
that Mr. <hi>Dundas</hi> means to make poor
<hi>Scotland</hi> the ſcape-goat to be ſacrificed
on the altar of <hi>Reform;</hi> and to pleaſe
the Miniſter with a <hi>ſmall</hi> one, becauſe
he has been diſappointed of a <hi>great,</hi>
he ſhall have a <hi>reform of the Court of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0586200600:102"/>
Seſſion,</hi> ſince he cannot have a <hi>Reform
of Parliament</hi> (to which, by the bye,
I did not know till t'other day that
Mr. Dundas himſelf, notwithſtanding
appearances, has always been a friend).
—No, no. This cannot be! WILLIAM
PITT would deſpiſe ſuch pitiful game.
<hi>Aut Caeſar, aut nihil,</hi> is HIS motto.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Poor is the triumph o'er the timorous hare."</l>
            </q>
            <p>We muſt go to the <hi>Aeneid</hi> for HIS

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſuſpicion of ſuch a ſacrifice
could be hatched only in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
where, before the <hi>heretable juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
were aboliſhed, a man was tried
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0586200600:103"/>
for his life in the court of one of the
chieftains. The jury were going to
bring him in not guilty: but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
whiſpered them, that <q>the
young <hi>Laird</hi> had never ſeen an
execution;</q> upon which their
verdict was—<hi>Death;</hi> and the man was
hanged.—Though our young Miniſter
has not yet ſeen a reform, I hope the
Court of Seſſion ſhall be ſpared.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Then truſt me, Percy, pity it were,</l>

            <p>I exhort you, my friends and

<hi>Goldſmith,</hi> who gave me many
<hi>nootes atticae,</hi> and gave me a jewel of

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0586200600:104"/>
you to <q>fly from petty tyrants to the
Throne!</q> Apply to the KING,
the fountain of law, juſtice, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction!
your application will not
be in vain.—My ingenious friend,
Mr. <hi>Tyers,</hi> in his admirable <hi>Political
Conferences,</hi> makes Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>
(defending to <hi>Pym</hi> his attachment to
<hi>Charles</hi> I.) expreſs the very thoughts
in my breaſt.—<q>In my higheſt flights,
whilſt a commoner, my heart was
never averſe to monarchy. I was
then neither a Puritan nor an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian.
<hi>The more opportunities I
poſſeſs of knowing the King, the
more ſtrongly am I attached to his
perſon and authority.</hi> A King of
England is not to be reduced to
the inſignificance of a Doge of
Venice. Since the murder of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0586200600:105"/>
who ruled, I confeſs,
with a very high hand, the King
has <hi>no favourite.</hi> He has taken
upon him the taſk of being <hi>more his

have not ſo much reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
any violation of popular
rights.</q>

            <p>My much reſpected great grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that "worthy gentleman" <hi>David
Boſwell of Auchinleck</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Thomas Boſwell</hi> was the firſt <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Auchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck</hi> (pronounced <hi>Affleck</hi>) Ayrſhire, after the eſtate had fallen to the Crown by the forfeiture of the very ancient family of <hi>that ilk (i. e.</hi> of the <hi>ſame name)</hi> there being no record nor tradition of any other family having it. I am told the <hi>Afflecks</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are the heirs of the forfeited family. I am proud of the <hi>connection;</hi> but ſhould be unwilling to reſign to them the <hi>eſtate,</hi> of which they have now no need. <hi>Thomas Boſwell</hi> was a deſcendant of the family of <hi>Balmuto,</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> whoſe eſtate was purchaſed in this century by a younger ſon of my family. The wife of <hi>Thomas Boſwell</hi> was a daughter of <hi>Campbell</hi> of <hi>Londoun,</hi> and a grand-daughter of the forfeited <hi>Affleck.</hi> He was honoured, in 1504, with a charter from James IV. of Scotland, <q>
                     <hi>Dilecto familiari noſtro—pro bono et fideli ſervitio nobis preſtito.</hi>
                  </q> He was killed with his King at the <hi>fatal field</hi> of <hi>Flodden,</hi> in 1513, fighting againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though he was himſelf of old York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire extraction, being deſcended of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable family of <hi>Boſville</hi> or <hi>Boſwell</hi> (for both they and we have ſpelt it both ways at different times) of <hi>Gunthwait,</hi> in the Weſt Riding. After a ſeparation for ages, I united our <hi>branch</hi> in cordial friendſhip with the <hi>Stock,</hi> our <hi>Chief</hi> the late <hi>Godfrey Boſville,</hi> Eſq. as honeſt a man, as perfect an example of <q>the nobleſt work of God,</q> as ever breathed. That friendſhip is continued with his ſon <hi>William Boſville,</hi> Eſq. who, with his father's honeſt heart, has the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> which he has gratified very extenſively. He is to let me have a freehold in Yorkſhire, a ſmall bit of the old manour, which will connect us from generation to generation.—If it ſhould be aſked, What has this note to do here? I anſwer—to illuſtrate the authour of the text. And to "pour out all myſelf as old <hi>Montaigne,</hi>" I wiſh all this to be known; and you who cenſure it, have read it, and <hi>muſt</hi> therefore know it.

His uncle, though he had
four daughters, the eldeſt of whom
was married to Lord <hi>Cathcart</hi> (who

I have fixed my opinion upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
queſtion, I maintain it, as a
point of conſcience, as a point of
honour; and the SOVEREIGN himſelf
would find me <hi>tenacem propoſiti,</hi> as I
humbly, but firmly was, upon the
ſubject of the American war. I am
a <hi>Tory;</hi> but not a <hi>Slave.</hi>—I am
poſſeſſed of an eſſay, dictated to me
by Dr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> on the diſtinction
between a <hi>Whig</hi> and a <hi>Tory,</hi> in which
it is ſhewn, by the wonderous powers
of that illuſtrious mind, that there is
but a ſhade of difference between a
moderate Whig and a ſpirited Tory
—between reaſonable men of each
party. Much would I yield, rather
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0586200600:109"/>
than ſhake the reverence due to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>SINCE this Letter was finiſhed, I have read
"<hi>The Rights of Juries vindicated,</hi> in the caſe
of the <hi>Dean of St. Aſaph,</hi> in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi>"
where Mr. <hi>Erſkine</hi> added ſo much to the luſtre
of his profeſſional character; and, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
as my approbation may be, I cannot
refrain from ſaying, that Mr. <hi>Welch's</hi> ſpeech
upon that occaſion appears to me, for legal
knowledge, acute reaſoning, and true conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
ſpirit, to be a maſterly performance,
and to eſtabliſh, beyond queſtion, that the
Juries of <hi>England</hi> are judges of law as well as
of fact, in <hi>many civil,</hi> and in <hi>all criminal</hi> trials.
Let me be alſo permitted to add one to the
number of his Majeſty's ſubjects who heartily
honour Mr. <hi>Juſtice Willes,</hi> for his clear, free,
yet temperate doctrine, delivered as a judge
not unworthy to have been one at the trial of
the Seven Biſhops.—That my principles of
<hi>reſiſtance</hi> may not be miſapprehended, any more
than my principles of <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> I proteſt that I
ſhould be the laſt man in the world to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
juries to contradict, raſhly, wantonly, or
perverſely, the opinion of the judges. On the
contrary, I would have them liſten reſpectfully
to the advice they receive from the Bench, by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0586200600:111"/>
which they may often be well directed in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own opinion; which, "and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,"
is the opinion they are to return upon
their oaths. But where, after due attention to
all that the judge has ſaid, they are decidedly
of a different opinion from him, they have not
only a <hi>power</hi> and a <hi>right,</hi> but they are <hi>bound in
conſcience,</hi> to bring in a verdict accordingly.
Thus it was in the late caſe of <hi>Spence,</hi> at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
which I have mentioned. The jury,
with every bias for the ſecurity of their own
property and peace, with every diſpoſition, as
good citizens, to check a deſperate rage of
mobbing, were nevertheleſs ſatisfied that that
young ſoldier, my client, then the priſoner at
the bar, (upon the <hi>general iſſue,</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>compounded of
law and of fact,</hi>
               </q> to uſe the ever-memorable
words of Baron <hi>Eyre,</hi> in Colonel <hi>Gordon's</hi> trial)
was not guilty of the felonious <hi>fire-raiſing,</hi> or
<hi>arſon,</hi> with which he was charged; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they acquitted him, at which my heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded.
It is but juſtice to add, that we have
at Edinburgh a moſt reſpectable gentleman, Sir
<hi>William Forbes</hi> of <hi>Pitſligo,</hi> who, when ſitting as
a juryman, and hearing one of the judges mutter
audibly, that <q>the law muſt be left to the
court!</q> roſe in his place, and, with a proper
courage, aſſerted the <hi>full right</hi> of himſelf and
his bretheren; which had a very good effect.</p>

the pleaſanteſt part of his life: and, while it gives the
remarks which Mr. <hi>Boſwell</hi> himſelf was able to make,
during a very curious journey, it will convey a ſpecimen
of that converſation, in which Wiſdom and Wit were
equally conſpicuous.</p>
