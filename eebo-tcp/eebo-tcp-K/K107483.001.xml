            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HO' ſuch <hi>ESSAYS,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the following <hi>Volumes,</hi> are in <hi>Univerſal Eſteem,</hi> and liable to every
One's <hi>Obſervations,</hi> yet it has not been my Fortune to meet with any <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> written purpoſely upon the <hi>Nature</hi> of them.
The <hi>ESSAYISTS</hi> are apt to beat the <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> in Search of <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>exotick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> to write upon, while a <hi>Diſquiſition</hi> into their own <hi>Works,</hi> which are capable of
afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Matter</hi> ſo ample, ſeems to be intirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked by <hi>Them.</hi> In this reſembling the human <hi>Mind,</hi> which while it
enters into, and examines the <hi>Depth</hi> of all other <hi>Sciences,</hi>
ſeems to conſider nothing leſs than its own <hi>Motions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOST other Kinds of <hi>Writing</hi> have, I think, been the <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> and <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0199100801:3"/> 
               <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> have been laid down for the <hi>Writers</hi>
of them to <hi>Obſerve;</hi> but in this <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> nobody is
confin'd; The only <hi>Rule</hi> that I know, (and it is generally well
obſerved) is not only to go without, but to go againſt all <hi>Order</hi>
and <hi>Method</hi> whatſoever. <hi>Montaigne,</hi> if I miſtake not, was
the <hi>Inventor</hi> of it; and <hi>He</hi> is in all its <hi>Beauties</hi>
and <hi>Faults</hi> the beſt <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> to examine it by. <hi>He</hi>
has a great deal of <hi>Wit,</hi> much good <hi>Obſervation,</hi> and ſome <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but his <hi>ESSAYS</hi> are wild, rambling, and incoherent;
ſome of them don't treat at all of the <hi>Subjects</hi> propos'd, and others
might as well have any other Title as thoſe they wear: They are, in effect,
like Mr. <hi>Bays</hi>'s <hi>Prologue,</hi> that would do either as <hi>Prologue</hi> or <hi>Epilogue,</hi> or ſerve indifferently for any other <hi>Play,</hi> as well as that which it was written for.</p>
            <p>THO' there are to be found among the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi> ſome
little <hi>Tracts</hi> upon particular <hi>Subjects,</hi> which if they were
written at this <hi>Time,</hi> would be called <hi>ESSAYS;</hi> yet as they
were generally (if we except the <hi>Sympoſiacks</hi> of <hi>Plutarch</hi>)
made by <hi>Receipts,</hi> and done with a View to the <hi>Rules,</hi> which <hi>Orators</hi> and <hi>Declai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> laid down for ſuch <hi>Compoſitions;</hi> the Honour of this <hi>Invention</hi> muſt ſtill
be aſcribed to <hi>Montaigne,</hi> who firſt introduced that uſeful <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Digreſſion</hi> into <hi>Treatiſes</hi> upon
ſelect <hi>Subjects;</hi> and by giving us every whimſical <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> that came into his Head, has led us as it were dancing after
his <hi>Morality,</hi> much more pleaſantly <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0199100801:4"/> than if we
walked in the Stilts, or were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Leading-Strings which <hi>Seneca</hi> had accuſtomed us to. <hi>Montaigne</hi> had a great many
Followers in <hi>France,</hi> and ſome in this Country: But the beſt, and
he that excelled his <hi>Original,</hi> was <hi>La Bruyere;</hi> the fineſt
and moſt delicate <hi>Remarks,</hi> the ſtrongeſt <hi>Senſe,</hi> and
the juſteſt <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> all embelliſhed by an Elegance of <hi>Style,</hi> and a Felicity of <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> are to be found in
his <hi>Works;</hi> to which we muſt add, that the frequent <hi>Egotiſms;</hi> the needleſs <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> the whimſical <hi>Diſplay</hi> of the Author's <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> at
every Period, and other Impertinences which paſs upon ſome for <hi>Humour,</hi> are not to be met with in him. He has all the <hi>Variety,</hi> and an Appearance of the <hi>Irregularity</hi> which
pleaſes, but intirely diveſted of the <hi>Digreſſion</hi> and <hi>Diſtraction</hi> which conſound and diſguſt the <hi>READER</hi> in
theſe Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In ſhort, reading <hi>Montaigne,</hi> is Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a
Country where you ſtart ſo much <hi>Game</hi> as to ſpoil your <hi>Sport;</hi> while <hi>La Bruyere</hi> gives you all the <hi>Pleaſure</hi>
and <hi>Variety</hi> of the <hi>Chace,</hi> without the Fatigue of following
the <hi>Prey</hi> too far.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT arraigning the <hi>Taſte</hi> of others, I will venture
to ſay, That very little in this Way, worth <hi>Obſervation,</hi> has
appeared at Home till the <hi>TATLER</hi> began to retail his Pennyworths of <hi>WIT.</hi> Several <hi>Political Tracts,</hi> it is true, have come forth,
and ſome <hi>Argumentative Diſcourſes</hi> which had their 
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0199100801:5"/> Shares of <hi>Merit;</hi> but did not come properly within
this Species of <hi>Writing.</hi> The Character of <hi>BICKERSTAFFE,</hi> had
it been real, was more upon the <hi>Humouriſt</hi> and <hi>Whimſical</hi>
than that of <hi>Montaigne;</hi> and I believe the Fiction which was ſeen in
it, by being natural, heighten'd the Pleaſure which it gave us; beſides,
the Limits of his Paper prevented his being ſo diffuſe and prolix, as we
often find the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who for want of ſuch a Confinement,
ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts us. The <hi>SPECTATOR,</hi> and <hi>NESTOR
IRONSIDE,</hi> are <hi>Characters</hi> alſo excellently well adapted to the
Creation of our <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> by our <hi>Knowledge</hi> of their being
Fictitious: For ſuch is our Malignity of <hi>Temper,</hi> that we can't
forgive a real <hi>Author</hi> acting or thinking oddly or idly, though our <hi>Entertainment</hi> ariſes from thence, becauſe we conſider him as a
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man, and obliged by a ſuperior <hi>Duty</hi> to another kind of <hi>Behaviour;</hi> but we can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge an imaginary, or aſſumed
Perſonage in any ludicrous, frolickſome or whimſical <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Opinions,</hi> becauſe we know that he only plays the <hi>Fool</hi> for
our <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Amuſement,</hi> which we grudge him to do for
his own. Thus <hi>Montaigne</hi>'s Faults are the Beauties of <hi>BICKERSTAFFE</hi> and <hi>IRONSIDE;</hi> and thus <hi>Cibber</hi> and <hi>Hippeſly</hi> are applauded on the <hi>Stage,</hi> for what they would in
private <hi>Life</hi> run the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of <hi>Correction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CERTAINLY, writing under an aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Character</hi> is
a fine Improvement in this <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0199100801:6"/> 
               <hi>Way;</hi> and I believe the <hi>Novelty</hi> of it, without derogating from the <hi>Wit, Humour,</hi> good <hi>Senſe,</hi> or excellent <hi>Style</hi> of thoſe mentioned <hi>Papers,</hi> made up the greateſt Part of their <hi>Merit:</hi> The
little Incidents of human <hi>Life,</hi> Pieces of <hi>Converſation,</hi> and
familiar <hi>Arguments,</hi> which may be thrown into <hi>Writing</hi> under
ſuch a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> give it the <hi>Advantage</hi> of all other <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi>: And I am of <hi>Opinion</hi> it muſt eternally <hi>Pleaſe</hi> (and the Succeſs of the following <hi>Papers,</hi> when
firſt publiſh'd, corroborates the Opinion) if as new <hi>Matter</hi> is
continually riſing, ſome <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's</hi> could be found able to treat it
in a Manner equal to their <hi>Predeceſſors.</hi> Tho' perhaps, <hi>The
Stamp Act</hi> firſt, and then the Riſe and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of <hi>Weekly
Journals,</hi> are now ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to a fair Hearing in this <hi>Method,</hi> as almoſt amount to a <hi>Prohibition</hi> of ſuch <hi>ESSAYS</hi> for the future.</p>
            <p>THE Invention of <hi>Weekly Journals,</hi> was, I believe owing to
the <hi>Taſte</hi> which the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to entertain from the Writings of
the <hi>TATLER, SPECTATOR,</hi> and others. Small <hi>ESSAYS</hi> were ſo
much liked, that it was imagined worth while to put a little <hi>Wit,</hi> and
a great deal of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> in a large Quantity of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſell it
for the ſame or a leſs Price than <hi>The Stamp Duty</hi> had rais'd the
half Sheet <hi>Treatiſe</hi> to. The <hi>Project</hi> ſucceeded, and we
have had ſeveral excellent <hi>Things</hi> publiſh'd in that <hi>Way;</hi>
ſome that in their <hi>Fame</hi> almoſt rivall'd any <hi>Thing</hi> that
went before them, but <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0199100801:7"/> by the Nature of their <hi>Subjects,</hi> ought to be excluded from this <hi>Claſs</hi> of <hi>Writing;</hi> which whatever Liberties Men take, ought never to be drawn
into Controverſies about <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> Things
that, to be ſure, require a more orderly and regular manner of Treating, than
is conſiſtent with the Freedom and Latitude of an <hi>ESSAY.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, as I hinted before, we have almoſt loſt the Advantage of <hi>Entertaining</hi> in any other <hi>Manner;</hi> the <hi>Journals</hi> come
abroad ſo ſeldom, that if a <hi>Humour</hi> was begun, Men would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it
before it could be proſecuted, and the <hi>Jeſt</hi> would be loſt before
it was found. The general Way now of communicating our <hi>Thoughts</hi> to the
Publick, is, by diſtinct and unconnected <hi>Letters</hi> to the <hi>Author</hi> of this or that <hi>Journal,</hi> and the common aſſumed <hi>Characters</hi> are, a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> a <hi>Critick,</hi> or a <hi>Divine;</hi> in theſe, ſome important <hi>Point</hi> is conſtantly
laid down, and as gravely and ſolemnly diſcuſſed. Thus we intrude upon
the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and ſeem not to think that to mend the <hi>Heart</hi> it
is neceſſary to pleaſe the <hi>Imagination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS certainly is miſſing the <hi>Mark,</hi> and theſe
little <hi>ESSAYS</hi> are written in the trueſt <hi>Taſte,</hi> when they
cloath good <hi>Senſe</hi> with <hi>Humour,</hi> and embelliſh good <hi>Morals</hi> with <hi>Wit;</hi> when they inſtruct <hi>Familiarly,</hi>
and reprove <hi>Pleaſantly;</hi> when they don't ſwell above <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,</hi> nor ſink below <hi>Delicacy:</hi> In ſhort, 
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0199100801:8"/> when they adapt the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Antients</hi> to the <hi>Guſt</hi> of the <hi>Moderns,</hi> and
conſtrain <hi>Montaigne</hi>'s Pleaſantry within <hi>BICKERSTAFFE</hi>'s
Compaſs.</p>
            <p>I CAN'T conclude without mentioning two Objections, which
amongſt others, theſe Sort of <hi>Writings,</hi> and their <hi>Authors,</hi> are liable to, the firſt is, That as from the <hi>Nature</hi> of their Subjects, it is often neceſſary they ſhould be <hi>Occaſional,</hi> which requires <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents that <hi>Accuracy,</hi> which much <hi>Leiſure,</hi> and frequent <hi>Reviews,</hi> generally produce in other <hi>Works,</hi> that in ſuch
Caſes, to sketch out, or deſign well, is as much as can be performed, which
certainly can give the <hi>Mind</hi> but a half <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and ſo
far the <hi>Work</hi> muſt neceſſarily be <hi>Imperfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Second is to be found in <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi>'s
Diſcoveries, which therefore take in his own Words.</p>
            <q>SOME that turn over all Books, and are equally ſearching in all
Papers, that write out of what they preſently find or meet without Choice; by
which means it happens that what they have diſcredited and impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one
Work, they have before or after extolled the ſame in another. Such are all
the <hi>Eſſayiſts,</hi> even their Maſter <hi>Montaigne.</hi> Theſe
in all they write, confeſs ſtill what Books they have read laſt; and
therein their <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0199100801:9"/> own Folly, ſo much, that they bring it to
the Stake <hi>raw</hi> and <hi>undigeſted:</hi> Not that the Place did need
it neither, but that they thought themſelves furniſhed, and would vent
it.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN a <hi>Stranger</hi> comes into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the Whiſper goes
round, <hi>Who is He?</hi> and the Face each Man wears, is the Effect of his
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: You ought therefore, to know, who I <hi>am,</hi> that you may
regard what I <hi>ſay</hi>; and then, it is to be hop'd, we ſhall
converſe without Jealouſy.</p>
            <p>I AM a talkative <hi>Old Batchelor,</hi> in my grand Climacterick,
of a ſanguine Complexion; well-limb'd, ſtrong and hearty; in Stature more
than middling; my Face is round and ſmooth, <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0199100801:11"/> my Forehead
high and open, my Eye-brows are widely arch'd, my Teeth ſound, and white; I
have a Noſe a little <hi>Aquiline,</hi> Eyes black and ſpritely; my Hair is
brown and ſhort, but ſomewhat of the thinneſt, with a Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grey
among it: I wear my Cloaths plain, am a great Lover of Walking, and go commonly
alone; I carry a pair of Mouſe-colour'd Gloves in one Hand, and my Oaken
Stick in the other, inſtead of a Cane; for I am naturally partial to the
Manufactures of my Country, and an irreconcileable Enemy to the <hi>Eaſt-India Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY Father, who was one of the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> of the laſt
Century, had a <hi>Daſh</hi> in his <hi>Temper,</hi> of what his
Miſtreſſes called <hi>Surly</hi>; but he was of frank Heart and ſimple
Manners. There was an unlucky kind of Contraſt in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for
he was Amorous, but Unpoliſh'd: He ſeems to have been rather Serious, than
Witty; yet he lov'd Wit in others, and was particularly charm'd with the
Wantonneſs of Mrs. <hi>Behn.</hi> That arch Baggage has made bold, in her
Comedy, called the <hi>Rover,</hi> both with his Name, and his
Character.—Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has ſeen <hi>Ned Blunt,</hi> has ſeen, not the <hi>Copy,</hi> but the very <hi>Life</hi> of my Father.</p>
            <p>HE left me an Eſtate, rather moderate than plentiful; which I
have neither improv'd, nor diminiſh'd. I was naturally diſpos'd to Quiet,
and affected to think calmly: For this <hi>Reaſon</hi> I have obſtinately
reſiſted MARRIAGE. I paſs my Summers at <hi>Blunt-Hall,</hi> the ancient 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0199100801:12"/> Seat of our Family, in the dirtieſt Part of <hi>Suſſex:</hi> My Winters I enjoy in Town, where I am the oldeſt Member
now alive of an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, of both Sexes, very numerous and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified:
We meet, twice a Week, at the Houſe of a ſober Widow, whom we placed there
on Purpoſe. But, becauſe I delight in Study, and am an Enemy to the Faction
and Flutter of the Polite End of the Town, I have my Lodgings in a low-built,
ſilent Houſe in the City, which has a large, ſhady Garden, and covers the
very <hi>Spot,</hi> where, of old, as <hi>Stow</hi> tells me, ſtood the
Watch-Tower of <hi>Barbican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT has always been my Cuſtom, To keep a daily Account, in
Writing, of my Actions and Obſervations, even to Particulars of no ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Importance. By Help of theſe Notes, I live over again my paſt Time, and
learn Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from my Follies.—I have lately been reflecting, and taken
it ſtongly into my Fancy, That, wanting Children of my own, I ſhould be
Every Body's Father: I have ſo many Things to ſay, and am ſo naturally
fond of <hi>Teaching,</hi> that I promiſe my ſelf no ſmall <hi>Fame,</hi>
from the Succeſs of my Weekly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: The SUBJECT of my PAPER gave me
little or no Pain: My Propenſity to Talking required, That it ſhould be <hi>General,</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundedly Copious</hi>; But the NAME was a <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,</hi> that I could not eaſily get over: That <hi>Large</hi>
Part of Mankind, which conſiſts of SUPERFICIALISTS, judging every Thing by
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, <hi>taſte</hi> but coldly of a Meaning which <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0199100801:13"/>
is not <hi>dreſs'd</hi> to their <hi>Reliſh</hi>; and the <hi>Will,</hi>
that is too ſtubborn to bend to the <hi>Fancy,</hi> ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be able
to work upon the <hi>Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Doubt was ſo knotty, that I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> where a learned <hi>Clergyman</hi> ſpoke firſt, and
was for calling it the INQUISITOR; He was honeſtly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give his <hi>Reaſons</hi> for that Name, but was ſmartly interrupted by an <hi>Alderman</hi>'s Wife, who, with Eyes full of Fire, and Face as red as her
Ribbands, told him, <hi>That, however the</hi> Inquiſition <hi>might agree
with</hi> His <hi>Principles, it would never go down with</hi> honeſt <hi>People and</hi> Proteſtants:—<hi>If you deſire,</hi> (ſaid
ſhe to me) <hi>That your</hi> PAPER <hi>ſhould be read by the</hi> Friends <hi>of the</hi> Government, <hi>you ſhould give it a</hi> ſober <hi>Name,
and call it the</hi> TRUTH-TELLER.</p>
            <p>A pert <hi>Coquet,</hi> who ſate next her, a Toaſt, and a
great Fortune, burſt into a loud Laugh; <hi>Oh! Heavens!</hi> cry'd the
Gipſey, <hi>I ſhall faint at the odious Formality of that</hi> Title! <hi>Ah, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam! How could you be ſo unreaſonably miſtaken! The</hi>
TRUTH-TELLER!—<hi>Lord, deliver us! why, the</hi> COURT <hi>can never
bear it! and all the</hi> gay World <hi>will deſpiſe and abhor
it!—No, no, if you wiſh your</hi> PAPER <hi>to</hi> Spread <hi>and
grow</hi> Publick, <hi>you have nothing to reſolve, but to call it the</hi>
SECRET.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FOR my Part,</hi> anſwered a grave Virgin, about Fifty, <hi>I think they would do well to entitle it the</hi> COQUET; <hi>There's
ſcarce a Fop in Town but would be fond of that Name; for he would conſider
the</hi> PAPER <hi>as his</hi> Property.</p>

Wind, (ſays he,) <hi>of Modern Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, being an Over-match for their</hi>
Weight, <hi>I am for calling it the</hi> BAGPIPE.—<hi>Oh! much rather

            <p>A <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> my next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in
the Country, and an eminent <hi>Fox-hunter,</hi> maintain'd, with invincible
Strength, both of <hi>Voice</hi> and <hi>Authority, That it ought, by all
Means, ſince it was intended for</hi> Society, <hi>to be called the</hi> GOOD
FELLOW; But he bow'd, and chang'd his Mind, when our <hi>Alderman's Young
Daughter,</hi> who ſate at her Mother's Elbow, bluſh'd, and whiſper'd in
his Ear, <hi>That for her Part, ſhe could think of no Name, that would be
ſo pretty, as the</hi> SWEET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HEART.</p>
            <p>AN <hi>Old Maid</hi> of the Widow's, to whom, for
Pleaſantry-ſake, we indulge the Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Privilege of
Impertinence, had been ſtanding all this while behind her Miſtreſs's
Chair, and broke out, on a ſudden, with an Air of Amazement; <hi>Hey Day! if
you muſt</hi> whip <hi>it about thus, and keep it conſtantly ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the beſt Thing you can do is, To call it the</hi> WHIRLIGIG. All the Company
laugh'd at the Wench's Conceit; 'till the <hi>Critick,</hi> aſſume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a
ſurpriz'd and deciſive Air, aſſur'd us, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0199100801:15"/>
poſitively, <hi>It</hi> muſt <hi>take; for that No Body could fail to
expect as much Wit, at leaſt, in the</hi> WHIRLIGIG, <hi>as in the</hi>
What-d'ye-call it.</p>
            <p>I was unſatisfied with All This; and having a natural Partiality
to my own Character, I bethought my-ſelf of the PLAIN DEALER. The whole
Aſſembly agreed in Approbation of That Name, and gave it, as their
Joint-Opinion, <hi>That, Whether it would be generally</hi> liked <hi>or no, it
was never more generally</hi> wanted.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>LADIES,</hi> when they hear, That my Deſign is PLAIN
DEALING, will conſider me perhaps, as an Old-faſhion'd Fellow, who can have
nothing to do with Them; yet I know they will be frequently kind enough to
furniſh me with Buſineſs, and I ſhall handle them, as often as they
allow me Opportunity.—The CHURCH and the STATE I have no great Genius for
meddling with; They are either <hi>well</hi> as they <hi>are,</hi> or will
never be the <hi>better</hi> for any Thing I can <hi>ſay</hi> to them. But
the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> the <hi>Humours,</hi> the <hi>Follies,</hi> the <hi>Diſquiets,</hi> the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> and the <hi>Graces</hi> of <hi>Human Life,</hi> All theſe I claim a Right to conſider as my Subjects;
and ſhall treat them, without Prejudice, in the moſt frank and open Manner;
ſo that the <hi>Watch-Tower</hi> of <hi>Barbican</hi> ſhall again reſume
its Uſe, and <hi>overlook</hi> this Antient CITY, for Her <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>

            <p>THREE Enormous Abuſes, have grown of late Years to a
ſcandalous Heighth among us, <hi>Maſquerading, Gaming,</hi> and <hi>Stock-Jobbing.</hi> They are Enemies to the Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Mankind, and
Deſtroyers of that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Doctrine of PLAIN DEALING which I would ſo
earneſtly recommend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MASQUERADES</hi> are the Undoers of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Honour, and
Innocence, and, methinks it ſhould be enough to deter any young <hi>Lady,</hi> if ſhe did but reflect upon this Great Truth, That her
Maſque, has, at beſt, thrown a Cloud upon her Reputation, that will hang
heavy for a long Time after, and ſink her in the Eſteem of her former
Admirers.</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>Gaming,</hi> the Sons of our Nobility, and the Heirs to
plentiful Eſtates, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who become too early their own
Maſters, are the Victims of Sharpers, the Prey of thoſe Man-hunters, who
form Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0199100801:17"/> to over-turn as many Honeſt
So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties as they can; and only live in Peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by being united in a
Confederacy to ſpread Deſolation among others. The Heads of our beſt
Families may not improperly be called the GAME of this wide-waſting
Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>STOCK-JOBBING</hi> is the Overthrow of all regular Commerce,
and involves many a rich Trader, in the utmoſt Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>THESE Three Grand Enormities ſtand in direct Oppoſition to
PLAIN DEALING; and the Province which I have undertaken, demands of me to
declare War againſt them, and exert my beſt Endeavours to remove them out
of the Way as faſt as I am able. They grow out of the Obliquity of a Mind,
that meditates an unnatural Increaſe of its own Eaſe, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the
Satisfaction of other People, and filling them with Uneaſineſs and
Diſquiet. Theſe Subjects are ſo fruitful, that I ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy this
whole Paper upon the <hi>Maſquerades</hi> alone, and defer the Correction of
the other to a ſecond Opportunity.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Count</hi> of the <hi>ill-favour'd Viſage</hi> may may
be conſidered as the Leader and Captain-General of theſe Forces; and
therefore, if in entring into a ſingle Combat with him, I am valiant enough
to get the better, I doubt not but the Army under his Command will pull off
their Maſques, in Reſpect to my Victory, and not be aſhamed to ſhew
their Faces, when they appear on the ſide that is uppermoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0199100801:18"/>THEY who lay <hi>Maſques</hi> to the <hi>Count</hi>'s Charge, have accounted for it very pleaſantly, and will have
it to be a politick Undertaking. He ought, ſay they, by the Laws of Sympathy
to have Regard to a Vizor, ſince his <hi>natural</hi> Countenance bears
ſuch Reſemblance to thoſe <hi>artificial</hi> ones, that the only means
in his Power to look like a <hi>Man,</hi> was to teach every Man to look like a <hi>Monſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I am not in a Humour to content my ſelf with ſuch
abſtracted Speculations, which appear to me to be artfully framed on
purpoſe to <hi>excuſe</hi> a Man they pretend to find fault with. It is
true, they make a Jeſt of the Perſon, but they throw a <hi>Maſque</hi>
over the Mind, which ought certainly to be moſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed. I dare
ſwear for the <hi>Count,</hi> it is not his nature to be angry with any Body,
that, by handling his <hi>Face</hi> a little <hi>freely,</hi> gives him a <hi>handſome</hi> Opportunity for handling the <hi>Pockets</hi> of other
People. <hi>Greater</hi> Stateſmen than <hi>He,</hi> have been contented to
look <hi>ſilly</hi> for a <hi>wiſe</hi> End, and to become the Jeſts of
the People, when they have been ſure of an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</hi> This makes
me afraid that theſe Waggs, who ſpeak of him with ſo much ſeeming
Smartneſs, are his Friends at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and I doubt, if the Truth were
known, he has bribed them to be of his Party by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them now and then,
into the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Maſquerading.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I MUST therefore take leave to look a little ſeriouſly into
this Matter, and I am afraid we <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0199100801:19"/> ſhall find, That the <hi>Count</hi> has not ſo much a Deſign to make Perſons of Quality with
their Maſques on, look like the <hi>Count,</hi> as to make the <hi>Count</hi>
look like Perſons of Quality with their Maſques off.</p>
            <p>SEVERAL Clergymen, ſome Biſhops, and other grave Perſonages,
have thought this a Matter of <hi>Importance</hi> enough to take Notice of as
well as I; but ſtill, it ſeems, the <hi>Count</hi> is ſecretly reſolved
to have Wit enough to take no notice of any of us. It muſt be allowed indeed,
That he is a Perſon of uncommon Parts, to ſtand Proof againſt the
Reaſoning of ſo many Learned, and Great Men, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the leaſt
convinced or perſwaded.</p>
            <p>BUT, tho' this Power, of reſiſting the Force of ſo many
Eloquent Reaſoners, proves him a Prodigy in <hi>Genius,</hi> and
demonſtrates him to have a world of Wit, yet I would not have him forget,
that there is <hi>ſome</hi> Merit alſo, in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.</hi> If a
Clergyman or a Biſhop, give their Opinions againſt him, he thinks it
ſufficient to ſhrug his Shoulders, and ſay, grinning in his own Defence,
That he wonders they ſhould make ſuch a Buſtle, <hi>for that a Domine, a
Caſſock, and a Mitre, are the moſt common Maſques in Faſhion.</hi>
This raiſes a loud Laugh, and he comes off cleverly among the <hi>young
Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;</hi> but he muſt not imagine to eſcape ſo with Perſons of <hi>my</hi> Gravity.</p>
            <p>SEVERAL old Counſellors of State, and at Law, grave
Phyſicians, ancient Citizens, and worthy Country Gentlemen, juſt come up
with <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0199100801:20"/> their Wives and Daughters, to pay a Viſit to the
Town, have all complained of him in their Turns, and met with no better
Quarter, and notwithſtanding all they can ſay to the contrary, he has
continued to carry on his Shew with very ſucceſsful Raillery: I expect that
he will give <hi>me</hi> my Share of his Taunts among the reſt; but I have as
little Taſte for his <hi>Wit,</hi> as I have for his <hi>Sweetmeats</hi>; and
to deal plainly with him, I am in no ſuch merry Vein, as he may think, when I
tell him this unwelcome Truth, That the Effects of <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querades,</hi> are
very ſerious Things to Husbands, and Fathers, tho' they are Jokes to him and
to <hi>ſome,</hi> who are pleas'd to ſupport him. I muſt, therefore,
deſire him to lay aſide his <hi>Wit,</hi> and conſider, with a little <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> whether He may not be in Danger of falling hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Clutches of a certain dark Enemy, who is now his Friend in <hi>Maſquerade,</hi> and who will not be ſo eaſily eluded.</p>
            <p>HE may recollect, if he pleaſes, in one of the <hi>Maſquerades,</hi> a ſtrange Spectacle, like a Man, whom he took, at
firſt, to have a Vizard on, but found upon a more narrow Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to have
exactly the Lineaments of his own Face, the ſame Shape, the ſame Air, the
ſame Gait, the ſame Cloaths, as himſelf, and his very Wig of the ſame
Colour, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Fore-top on one Tip of the Ear, juſt like his
own: He may remember, that this ghaſtly Mimick, conſtantly attended him,
that whole Night, did every thing that he did; <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0199100801:21"/> ſaid
every thing he ſaid; and went to every Place where he went: He may remember,
that he was ſtruck with a terrible Panick, and did not know what to think of
this uninvited Companion of his, but took him, ſometimes, for a meer Mimick;
ſometimes for a Spectre, but at laſt he was convinced, that it cou'd be no
other, than the <hi>Devil,</hi> which a great many <hi>well-meaning</hi> People
believ'd was certainly the Truth: and he very well knows, that he, and his
Companion, were eaſily miſtaken for one another, and that no body at laſt
could well tell which was the <hi>Count,</hi> and which was the <hi>Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THO' the <hi>Count,</hi> as the Phraſe goes of him, looks <hi>bad</hi> enough at the <hi>beſt,</hi> he was remark'd to look much
worſe after this Viſion, than at any time before: He was for many Days much
dejected, and profoundly penſive and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and the terrible
Apprehenſions he was under, cauſed a viſible Increaſe of Wrinkles, and
furrow'd him into ſuch Frightfulneſs, that if ever he went to <hi>take
Coach,</hi> the <hi>Horſes</hi> wou'd ſtart, and run away from
him.—But one Day, above the reſt, when he was deep in the doleful Mood,
an airy young Fellow hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſay, He intended to have no more <hi>Maſquerades,</hi> got out of him the <hi>Secret</hi> of his <hi>Diſorder:</hi> This Youth who was afraid, that if that Diverſion
diſcontinued, he ſhould not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with a Lady, for whoſe ſake He
was us'd to <hi>hide</hi> his <hi>Face,</hi> that he might charm her, with
leſs Difficulty, found an Expedient <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0199100801:22"/> to free the <hi>Count</hi> from his Fears, and made him believe, that it was a <hi>Trick</hi> of the <hi>Prince de Monte Aſpero.</hi> But the poor <hi>Count</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on, if he gives Credit to that fictitious Story,
and might have been better advertis'd of the Truth, if he had only had an Eye
to the <hi>Club-Foot,</hi> which ſtood out, and <hi>plainly ſhewed</hi> his
Companion, as ſeveral innocent Spectators then preſent could teſtify.
Beſides, as a <hi>Poet,</hi> who would preſerve <hi>Probability,</hi> could
produce no Body proper to perſonate <hi>Amphitryon</hi> but <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
nor to mimick <hi>Sofia</hi> to the Life but <hi>Mercury</hi>; ſo the <hi>Count,</hi> if he reflects ſufficiently, upon his Perſon, Parts, and
Qualities, muſt of neceſſity be convinc'd, in his Mind, that ſince
nothing <hi>Human</hi> could ſo exactly reſemble him, It <hi>muſt</hi>
be, at leaſt, a <hi>Cacodaemon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole, if he lay this ſeriouſly to heart, as I hope
he will, he will lay aſide jeſting, become a true Penitent, and take the
good Time of <hi>Lent</hi> to conſider, Whether it will not be proper to quit
all Thoughts of <hi>Maſquerading,</hi> for fear that Ghaſtly Figure that
once took his Perſon <hi>upon</hi> him, ſhou'd the next Time, <hi>take
off</hi> his Perſon.</p>

            <p>SO weak is the <hi>Frailty</hi> of Human Nature, that we can never
be too <hi>ſecure,</hi> tho' <hi>arm'd</hi> with the ſublimeſt <hi>Vertue,</hi> againſt the repeated <hi>Attacks</hi> of ſo many <hi>Paſſions,</hi> as conſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege us; and, tho' the Garriſon
of the Mind may be never ſo well provided with all Means of Reſiſtance,
the greateſt of <hi>Qualities, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> and <hi>Perfections,</hi> that
our Nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of attaining; nevertheleſs <hi>Treachery,</hi>
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Force</hi> or <hi>Stratagem,</hi> from without, may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and defeat us: An Example of which Infirmity the following <hi>Story</hi> will
furniſh the Reader, and teach him, of all Things, to avoid, what is call'd <hi>Spiritual Pride,</hi> That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of another for not being ſo good, as
himſelf, when he ſees how, in an Inſtant, the greateſt Piety and
Religion, may be chang'd, (by indulging only one dangerous <hi>Paſſion</hi>) into the other Extream of <hi>Wickedneſs</hi>; ſo
that <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0199100801:24"/> we may apply to the Lubricity of Human Vertue, what a
wiſe Man of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſaid of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> That it can
never be determin'd, 'till Death.</p>
            <p>IN the following <hi>Story,</hi> which is true, as to Fact, I
ſhall be obliged to <hi>diſguiſe</hi> ſome <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> of
Time and Place, to prevent the unfortunate Subject of this <hi>Paper,</hi> or
his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> from being known, ſo that it will be enough to inform
the <hi>Reader,</hi> That, leſs than half an <hi>Age</hi> ago, there liv'd a
certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of good <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> who had
poliſh'd, and finiſh'd, a Learned Education by the Improvement of a <hi>Camp,</hi> and a <hi>Court</hi>; in Both which He ſpent ſome Time; when
about the Thirtieth Year of his Age, he thought fit to ſettle himſelf in
the World, and change his <hi>Condition,</hi> by chuſing a Partner of <hi>Life,</hi> whoſe <hi>Mind</hi> was as well Adorn'd, as her <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was Engaging: This happy <hi>Couple</hi> ſpent Five Years
together, in perfect Felicity; the <hi>Husband</hi> with Reputation, as well as
Fortune, and the <hi>Wife</hi> with Vertue, not inferior to her Beauty.</p>
            <p>BUT what crown'd all their <hi>Bliſs,</hi> was, That mutual <hi>Eſteem</hi> they had contracted for one another; in this time they had
two or three <hi>Children,</hi> who all dy'd in their Infancy: And now, it
pleas'd Heaven to ſnatch, from this <hi>happy</hi> Man, the only Joy and
Comfort of his <hi>Life</hi>; his Charming Spouſe died, and left him not only
an inconſolable, but almoſt diſtracted, <hi>Widower:</hi> When the
firſt Emotions <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0199100801:25"/> of <hi>Grief</hi> were over, he retir'd,
from his own Houſe, to a little Farm, in another <hi>Country,</hi> where no <hi>Object</hi> ſhould come in his <hi>way,</hi> to revive in his Memory the <hi>Loſs</hi> of his lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Wife:</hi> Here he ſpent two Years,
which led him into the Thirty Eighth of his <hi>Life:</hi> this Time he divided
between his Studies and Devotion; being <hi>Religious</hi> from his very
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy: Which natural <hi>Piety</hi> was, now, ſo much increas'd, by his
late Loſs, that at laſt he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quit his Native Country, and to
retire into a <hi>Convent,</hi> being born, and bred in the Roman Catholick
Communion.</p>
            <p>THIS Reſolution was no ſooner known to his Friends, but they
endeavour'd to <hi>divert</hi> it, by all manner of <hi>Perſuaſions</hi>
and <hi>Arguments</hi>; by remonſtrating to him, That he was, now, in the
Flower of his Age, and bleſt with a plentiful <hi>Fortune</hi> to give him
all the Comforts and Pleaſures of <hi>Life</hi>; that it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
thus, to fling himſelf away, not only to himſelf, but his Friends and
Family, to whom he ow'd the Debt, which he had contracted, for Poſterity to
continue his Name: They told him, That he had paid all the Tribute to the
Memory of his deceas'd Wife, that the Laws of Honour, Decency, and the
Obligations of a good Husband required; that he was now at Liberty to make
another Choice; that one good Woman was not a Phoenix, but that others of the
ſame Species might be found, to make him as happy as before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0199100801:26"/>THESE Arguments, tho' back'd with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
were all ineffectual; he was deaf to every Remonſtrance; and paſs'd over
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he plac'd himſelf, at firſt, as Penſioner
in a Religious Houſe; and liv'd with the ſame Strictneſs, that even the
Rules of that Order requir'd from thoſe, who were under Vows of ſuch
Auſterities; nor did he receive more Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from the Example of others,
than he gave by his own.</p>
            <p>AFTER a Life led, for ſome time, with the greateſt Eſteem
and Reputation, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Superiors of the Houſe, his ardent
Deſire of being receiv'd into their Society: The good Fathers, tho' inwardly
pleas'd with the Honour of having ſo excellent a Perſon, in their Order,
did not receive his Propoſal with that Chearfulneſs, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
Their Prudence ſuggeſted to them, that he was yet too young a Man, to be
real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon good Grounds, diſguſted with the World, into the Love of
which he lay under great Temptations of relapſing, by reaſon of that large
Fortune, which could furniſh Means of enjoying thoſe Pleaſures, which he
muſt now for ever abandon; and the Loſs of which, if he ſhould repent his
Vows, would make him as miſerable, as he propos'd to himſelf to to be
happy: They conjur'd him, at the ſame time, ſtrictly to ſearch his own
Heart, ſo as to be convinced, that this Deſire was an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, and Call
from God, and not any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Diſguſt of the World, which might 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0199100801:27"/> blow over, and vaniſh in time: He ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this
Propoſal, and in a little time aſſur'd them, That it proceeded from the
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of that Providence, to whoſe Service he had ſo ſtrong and
glorious a Paſſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the reſt of his Life: Upon this, the
Society conſented, on Condition, That he would undergo a double Noviciate,
that by the length of the Time, they might be aſſur'd of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confirm'd in thoſe pious Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>THIS he accepted, and immediately ſent over Powers into his own
Country, to convey and ſettle his Eſtate upon his Heir, which was
accordingly done; and the Time of his Novice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being expir'd, he took his
Vows, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced that Life in which he propos'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much
Heavenly Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>HE had not thus lived long in the Convent, but his great Capacity
and Learning, render'd him too neceſſary to the Service of his Order, to be
kept at home; by Command of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors he went on ſeveral Commiſſions
into other Countries, where he executed the Orders, which he had receiv'd, with
wonderful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and Fidelity; at the ſame time acquiring an univerſal
Reputation, for his extraordinary Sanctity of Life.</p>
            <p>HIS Fortune ſettled him, at laſt, in <hi>France,</hi> where he
met with the ſame Eſteem, and Veneration, as in other Countries, being
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally careſs'd, and admir'd: At laſt his ardent Zeal for the
Service of God, inflam'd him with a paſſionate Deſire of laying 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0199100801:28"/> down his Life, in aſſerting the Croſs of Chriſt;
nothing wou'd now ſatisfy his grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fervour, but to be ſent on a
Miſſion, to convert Infidels to the Chriſtian Faith, in which Employ he
had the holy Ambition to meet with a Crown of Martyrdom. This pious
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination he communicated to the Superiors of his Order, but was repulſed
in his Requeſt, being told, That Men of leſs Weight, than he, might be as
ſerviceable in the Converſion of Savages; that leſs Abilities, than his,
were ſufficient to inſtruct Nations, ſo ſtupidly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; that his
Preſence was more neceſſary in <hi>Europe,</hi> where they had ſo many
Learned Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to combat.</p>
            <p>THIS Repulſe not a little mortify'd the Zeal of the good Father,
whoſe Paſſion for Martyrdom was now more inflam'd, by hearing, That there
was a new Miſſion of <hi>French Jeſuits</hi> going over to <hi>America:</hi> He apply'd himſelf to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Quebec,</hi> who was juſt upon his Departure for <hi>Canada</hi>; this
Prelate was ſo charm'd with the Zeal, and Piety of the Man, whoſe Character
he had heard before, that he enter'd into his Sentiments, and made uſe of the
Intereſt he had in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> to get the Requeſt of this
New Apoſtle granted by Authority. Thus, Maſter of his Wiſhes, he went
over with the Biſhop to <hi>Canada,</hi> where he met with as much Veneration
of his Piety, Humility, and all other Chriſtian Vertues, in <hi>America,</hi>
as he left behind him in <hi>Europe:</hi> After ſome time of Refreſhment,
he prepar'd <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0199100801:29"/> for his Apoſtolical Function, and went with
his Collegues, among the moſt ſavage, and cruel Nations of the <hi>Indians:</hi> Some of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades were murther'd by theſe People;
others died of the Hardſhips and Fatigues which they endured, while our
Miſſionary eſcap'd, thro' the Goodneſs of his Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>IN this firſt Expedition, he was ſeveral times in imminent
Danger of Life, having once the Knife over his Head to ſcalp him; but
Providence, whoſe Secrets are unſearchable, preſerv'd him, and would not
vouchſafe that Honour, which he ſo paſſionately deſir'd, of dying a
Martyr: In this firſt Attempt, he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far, as to vanquiſh the
Obſtinacy and Ignorance of Twenty-two <hi>Indian</hi> Men and Women, whom he
baptiz'd, and brought with him to <hi>Quebec</hi>; which Town he enter'd,
tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly, with his Converts. The Reader may gueſs at the Veneration paid
him by the People, who look'd on him as a Saint and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and preſt
near to touch, and kiſs his very Garments: The Winter Months he was oblig'd
to ſpend his Time at <hi>Quebec,</hi> it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to preſerve
Life in ſo cold a Country, without the Cover of Houſes againſt the
Incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Air: The Summer-Seaſons were taken up, entirely, by the
Labours of his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which he had wonderful Succeſs the third
Winter, at which time he approach'd the 50th Year of his Age: The Governour,
who had a profound Reſpect for him, invited the good Miſſioner to come
and reſide at his Houſe, <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0199100801:30"/> with a Requeſt to
inſtruct his Daughter, who deſired to learn Languages, and Mathematicks:
The good Father chearfully undertook his New Province, and very
aſſiduouſly attended his young Pupil, the Pregnancy of whoſe Parts made
his Pains the more agreeable: This Lady was about Eighteen Years old, with a
Perſon equal to the Beauties of her Mind, and all the Vivacity ſo natural
to her Country: The Preceptor had not often attended his fair Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but he
found thoſe Emotions in his Heart, which, in a little time ſhipwreck'd his
Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; he fell deſperately in Love, and thro' the Eyes, ſuck'd in that
Poyſon, which now taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Soul, that ſo much Vertue had long, and
conſtantly defended before: LOVE, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Tyrant, entirely
ſubdued, and added the Heart of this once Holy Man, to his other Triumphs: In
order to make himſelf the more agreeable, he cut off his Beard, and now put
on Linnen, next his Skin, which he had not worn for ſome Years, the more to
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his Mortification, tho' he was not oblig'd to that Auſterity by the
Rules of his Order: That Devotion, which had flam'd ſo long in his Heart
towards God Almighty, was now turn'd into Adoration of one of his Creatures;
LOVE converting all others Paſſions into itſelf, as the Plague does all
other Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, he managed his Amours with that Addreſs, That, at
laſt, he triumph'd, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd his Criminal Deſires; the Fruits of
which ſoon appear'd; the young Damſel was with <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0199100801:31"/> Child,
which flung the Lovers into the laſt Confuſion and Diſtreſs: There was
no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, but one, which was, To fly; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly one Night, the Summer now
advancing, ſo as to permit them to lie in the Woods, they got over the
Ramparts, and fled to the <hi>Indians,</hi> among whom he had a great
Intereſt, and who now receiv'd them with open Arms. As he had ſeen ſome
Campaigns in his Youth, and underſtood Fortification, and the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Part of War, he began to Train and Diſcipline the Savages, whom he
perſuaded to revolt againſt the <hi>French:</hi> In the mean while, the
Governour, overwhelm'd with Grief for this terrible Misfortune in his Family,
ſent out ſeveral ſmall Parties to bring them back; but theſe were
defeated by the Superiority of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; upon which the Governour march'd with
the whole Garriſon, and all the Fighting Men he could muſter; the Lovers
animated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd the Savages, whom they brought, in great Numbers, to
oppoſe the Enemy; the little Armies came in ſight, and while the Two
Unfortunate Lovers ſtood cloſe to one another, ſhe, with an <hi>Indian</hi> Quiver at her Back, and Bow in her Hand, the firſt Fire from
the <hi>French</hi> laid them both on the Ground; Such was the ſad
Cataſtrophe of this unhappy Man, whoſe Piety, and good Life, for ſo many
Years, could not prevent his Falling, at laſt, ſo Memorable an Example of <hi>The Imbecility of all Human Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments.</hi>

and Magnificence, till <hi>he</hi> reduc'd him to this <hi>Diſparity?</hi>
Can my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders imagine, That <hi>Cartaerarius</hi> muſt not loſe the

different Fortune, and of the Tricks he had play'd in his Life, and the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> he had made as wretched, as the <hi>Object</hi> I have

            <p>THIS is a ſtrange and melancholy <hi>Fate:</hi> a Box and Dice

            <p>IT is ſtill more ſtrange, That a Cuſtom, which has been
known to have brought ſuch uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamities upon the greateſt and
richeſt Men, ſhould at laſt become common, among the common People
themſelves: And yet this was lately the Caſe. Tradeſmen and Sharpers of a
Lower Rank, committed the like Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Shops were ſhut up <hi>by
way of Gaming.</hi> I know one <hi>Wiſe Man</hi> an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> who
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected his <hi>Buſineſs</hi> to become <hi>Rich,</hi> and has been
ſeen to loſe more Money by ſhaking his Elbow over a <hi>Gaming-Table</hi>
in three Hours, than he <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0199100801:34"/> could recover by brandiſhing his
Arm over a <hi>Mortar</hi> in three times as many Months.</p>
            <p>I AM the more ſlack in my Remarks, and throw together only a few
looſe Hints againſt this vicious Habit, becauſe a more effectual Way has
been lately taken to check its Progreſs. And, if People of Faſhion did not
think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above the Benefit of thoſe Laws which vulgar Perſons
are cautious of tranſgreſſing, for fear of being treated as Cheats, and
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, this Diſcourſe would be render'd uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. The Nature of
Impoſture, is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alter'd, by being the Fact of a Perſon of
Diſtinction, but by its becoming more highly Criminal. Out of Perſons of
Faſhion and Eſtate, are generally choſen thoſe, who are obliged to
watch over the publick Welfare: And can they guard Property in publick Life,
who lay Snares to entrap it in a private Capacity? No Man ſhould be allow'd
to appear in an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> who has made himſelf
a <hi>Member</hi> among the Surrounders of a <hi>Hazard Table.</hi> There have
been of late but <hi>Two</hi> Gameſters, that ſtepp'd high enough to have
any Rule in publick Affairs entruſted to their Management, <hi>Exlex</hi> and
the young <hi>Montanus</hi>; theſe, tho' otherwiſe Men of ſignal
Capacities, and many worthy Qualifications, could not reſiſt their Natural
Propenſity, and thereby infus'd into two Kingdoms ſuch an univerſal
Spirit of <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Gaming,</hi> by ſtrange Schemes, 'till
then unheard-of, as muſt, if continued, have <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0199100801:35"/> ſoon
accompliſh'd the Ruin, which they threaten'd at their firſt Appearance.</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>Gaming</hi> in lower Life, the Juſtices of the Peace
have acted with ſuch commendable Vigilance, That they have ſcarce left me a
known Sharper in the Town, to exerciſe the Edge of my Satire upon. Moſt of
them have, I believe, by this time, taken to the more <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> way
of Robbing with a <hi>Piſtol</hi> and <hi>Brace of Balls</hi> in it, which is
much leſs <hi>dangerous</hi> to the <hi>Offended,</hi> and leſs <hi>ſafe</hi> to the <hi>Offender,</hi> than a <hi>Box</hi> with a <hi>Pair
of Dice</hi> in it: Others have gone in Gangs like Foot-pads, and while one
knock'd down the Paſſenger, the other rifled him, which is only a kind of <hi>Emblem</hi> of their Play called <hi>Two poll One.</hi> Thus I believe,
that, if a ſtrict Scrutiny were made into the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that are left, of the <hi>Fraternity,</hi> we ſhould find, that, ſince the happy Diſſolution
of that Knot, moſt of the looſe ones have been ſwept away, by his
Majeſty's induſtrious Subject Mr. <hi>Jonathan Forward</hi> Rear-Admiral of
the <hi>City Tranſports.</hi>

            <p>A <hi>Bear</hi> is a Beaſt of Prey, who, not having perhaps a
Morſel in the World, appears with the Pretence of a whole <hi>Paw full</hi>
of <hi>Stock,</hi> which he agrees to deliver on a Day. But, if <hi>Stock</hi>
riſes, he muſt, as the Phraſe is, <hi>Shew his Tail,</hi> that is, he
muſt <hi>Run away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Bull</hi> is juſt the Reverſe of this: He, is as
Pennyleſs as his Brother Beaſt, but roars and bellows for <hi>Stock,</hi>
and <hi>Devours</hi> all that is offer'd him; and if, at the Time when it is to
be paid for, it happens to fall, then he too muſt <hi>Run off,</hi> as the <hi>Bear</hi> did.</p>
            <p>NUMBERS of honeſt Tradeſmen are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by theſe <hi>odd
Beaſts,</hi> and kept warm with imaginary <hi>Hopes</hi> of turning their
Money better and faſter upon <hi>Stocks,</hi> than in Buſineſs: And where
the Unskilful are drawn in to try their Fortunes this way, their Money becomes
a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> to the <hi>Jobbers,</hi> and themſelves <hi>Bankrupts</hi> to the <hi>Publick: Bulls</hi> and <hi>Bears,</hi> as
oppoſite as they are in their Natures, agree very well together, and
ſometimes perſonate one another to draw in an honeſt Citizen; and if he
once gets between <hi>both,</hi> by that Time the <hi>Stocks,</hi> have had a
few Variations to and fro, he is ſure, by their <hi>toſſing</hi> him from
one to t'other, to be <hi>worried</hi> out of his Senſes.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0199100801:37"/>MY Friend the <hi>Alderman,</hi> who has
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a way of Jeſting peculiar to himſelf, ſays, That when he has
been running over the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements,</hi> relating to Bankrupts in our <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes,</hi> he would frequently make Marks on the Margin, denoting,
Where ſuch a <hi>broken-hearted</hi> Butcher has been forced to ſhut up his
Stall upon being Gored by the <hi>Horn</hi> of a <hi>Bull</hi>; and where the <hi>Paw</hi> of a <hi>Bear</hi> has pulled a rich Linnen-Draper by the Head and
Ears, over his Counter. I warrant you, my old Friend, (will he often ſay, for
he is apt to dwell upon old <hi>Jokes</hi>) when the Watch-Tower of <hi>Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> was ſtanding, the ſharpeſt Eye of any Man that ſtood
in it, could never perceive round this whole City, one ſuch voracious
Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, threatning Ruin to the Inhabitants, as the Modern <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Bears</hi> are.</p>
            <p>IT is certain, That the <hi>Alderman</hi>'s <hi>Jeſt</hi> was
true in <hi>Earneſt.</hi> For our wiſe Anceſtors made wholſome Laws for
extirpating all wild and miſchievous Beaſts out of the Land, and ſet a
Price upon their Heads. It muſt be therefore very wrong in ſuch a Populous
Town as this, to permit <hi>Bulls,</hi> and unmuzzled <hi>Bears,</hi> to have
their Stalls and Dens about <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> where they have
Opportunity to run out and deſtroy unwary Citizens. Beſides, the <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> told me (as a Remark of his Wife,) That under Boaſt of the
vaſt <hi>Stocks</hi> they deal for, they tempt the yielding Hearts of many a
rich Citizen's Daughter, and pin themſelves on Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to be kept without a
Groat, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0199100801:38"/> take a <hi>Bite</hi> of the young
Lady, in that Part they like beſt, and then run away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>coming</hi> to <hi>account</hi> for it. She ſays, That Mr. <hi>Honeyman,</hi> a Sugar Baker, has Two Cubs upon his Daughter's hands, by a <hi>Bear</hi> that has left the <hi>Alley</hi>; and that Mr. <hi>Simple</hi>'s
Favourite Child is upon the Point of being delivered of a Calf, begot by a
ſilly awkward <hi>Bull,</hi> that <hi>Burſt</hi> himſelf, by <hi>ſwallowing Stock,</hi> beyond the Power of his natural <hi>Digeſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are Things not to be tolerated in any Civil Government
whatſoever; for they manifeſtly tend to the Ruin of Commerce; and at this
rate it will come to paſs in the courſe of a few Years, That while <hi>Ruſſia</hi> is poliſhing its rough Inhabitants into the finer
Reſemblance of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> the Politeneſs of <hi>Britain</hi>
will be transformed into the Barbarity of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and the
greateſt Part of this Metropolis will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with an unheard-of
Generation of <hi>Savages</hi> and <hi>Monſters.</hi> It is, therefore, my
ſerious Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the Practice ſhou'd be put down; and that for the
Quiet and Safety of <hi>ſober Citizens,</hi> every <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Bear</hi> of them all, ſhould be firſt driven out of the City, by the
way of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and then tranſported out of the Kingdom.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Prejudices</hi> of our <hi>Minds,</hi> and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Intereſts</hi> we are led by, make us very unqualified Judges, of the

wiſh to avoid the Society of that Man, who could reflect on the following
Story, without unuſual Emotions, in Honour of the <hi>Noble Roman,</hi> to

            <p>IN that part of the <hi>Punick</hi> War, when <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
Maximus</hi> commanded the Forces of <hi>Italy,</hi> againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> certain Officers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, were taken
Priſoners by the Enemy. <hi>Fabius</hi> was well acquainted with the Skill
and Courage of theſe Men, and reſolv'd not to loſe them: He, therefore,
treated with the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> and agreed upon their Ranſom, at a
very high Sum. for Payment of which, by a Day appointed, he engag'd the Honour
of the <hi>Roman Senate:</hi> But the <hi>Senate,</hi> inſtead of ſending
him the Money, refuſed to ratify the Agreement.—<hi>Fabius</hi>
receiv'd the News, with more <hi>Grief,</hi> than <hi>Indignation</hi>; and,
giving ſtrict Orders, for concealing it from his Army, diſpatch'd his Son
to <hi>Rome,</hi> with all Secrecy and Expedition, to make Sale of his <hi>Own
Paternal Eſtate,</hi> and to return to him with the <hi>Money</hi>; which as
ſoon he receiv'd, he ſent it to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as from the <hi>Senate,</hi>—<hi>For I had rather,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>It ſhould be
reported of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>That they have a</hi> General <hi>without</hi> Land, <hi>than a</hi> Senate <hi>without</hi> Humanity?</p>
            <p>OUR <hi>Clergyman,</hi> whom we delight to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, as a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Life</hi>

expatiating, the other Day, on the <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Grandeur,</hi> of
this <hi>Action</hi>; and had fix'd us, in the moſt ſatisfied, and
reſpectful Attention; when he was broke in upon, by the <hi>Coquet,</hi> with
the following Relation, which ſhe aſſur'd us, was Matter of Fact, and
happen'd very lately;—<hi>And it contains,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>ſo
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted an Inſtance of refin'd, and generous</hi> Love, <hi>That if ever I
find a Man, who would be</hi> Mine <hi>upon ſuch Terms, I ſhall</hi> Marry, <hi>and bid Defiance to the Sound of the Word</hi> Matron!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>COURTHOPE</hi> was the Son of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant,
who had liv'd long in the <hi>Canary Iſlands</hi>; he had been ſent young
to <hi>London,</hi> for the Advantage of his Education, and (while there) fell
in <hi>Love</hi> with <hi>Bellaria,</hi> the only Daughter of a Gentleman of a
good Family and Eſtate, who had promis'd this Lady to a diſtant Relation,
of his Name: But ſhe had an Averſion for his Perſon, and made open
Profeſſion of a Paſſion for young <hi>Courthope,</hi> which the Father
was ſo far from approving, that, being provok'd by her Firmneſs, he
command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, under Penalty of his Hatred, and his Curſe, never more to
converſe with him; and confin'd her, from that time forward, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent even
the Poſſibility of it. <hi>Bellaria,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this
Reſtraint, found means to eſcape, and dreſſing her ſelf in Boy's
Cloaths, imbark'd with <hi>Courthope,</hi> on a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship, that
was bound for the <hi>Canaries</hi>; where he aſſur'd her, they would be
welcome to a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> whoſe gentle Nature knew nothing of 
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0199100801:43"/> that <hi>Rigour,</hi> which, from her Infancy, ſhe had
been oppreſs'd by. They were taken in this Voyage, by a <hi>Mooriſh</hi>
Veſſel, belonging to the Rovers of <hi>Sallee:</hi> And 'tis eaſier to
conceive, than expreſs, the Affliction, the Deſpair, the Aſtoniſhment
of <hi>Courthope:</hi> fallen, at once, from a Proſpect of the ſweeteſt,
and moſt live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Joy, to the Depth of conſummate Miſery! He ſaw <hi>Her,</hi> now, the Companion of his <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> who had wiſh'd,
and ventur'd, ſo much, to make <hi>Him</hi> Partner of her <hi>Affluence</hi>; and he ſuffer'd more than Death, every time, that his
Eyes, all ſwimming in Tears, ſtole a Glance, at his <hi>Bellaria,</hi> whom
he durſt not diſtinguiſh, by any Marks of Reſpect, or Service, for fear
of pointing out her <hi>Sex,</hi> to the Brutes, who were their Maſters.</p>
            <p>BUT what aggravated his Sorrow, to the moſt piercing Extremity,
was, an Information he receiv'd from a Native of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> whom he
found a Slave at <hi>Sallee,</hi> That his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was newly dead, and that all
his Effects had been ſeiz'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> on Occaſion of
ſome Criminal Correſpondencies, which he had unwarily been drawn into.</p>
            <p>THEY paſs'd about a Week, with the reſt of their Ship's
Company, in a publick Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of the City, where they were to expect the
killing Summons, which muſt expoſe them in a <hi>Market,</hi> to be ſold,
and torn for ever from the Enjoyment of that mutual Comfort, which was, now,
the only Thought, that could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port 'em in their Wretchedneſs. The Moon, 
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0199100801:44"/> one Night, ſhone clearly thro' the Grates of the
Priſon Windows; and <hi>Courthope,</hi> while the reſt were aſleep, hung,
in melancholy Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, over the Boſom of <hi>Bellaria,</hi> who
ſtarted, in broken Slumbers, and fill'd his Soul with ſad Reflections. He
took Notice of a rugged Stone, which roſe, pointed, thro' the Earth, and
imagining it might hurt her, remov'd it, with much Difficulty, and had no
ſooner drawn it out, but he diſcover'd an old Piece of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Cloth,
which had formerly been hidden under it, in which were Sixty <hi>Moidores,</hi>
Two <hi>Gold Rings,</hi> and a <hi>Writing</hi> which he perceiv'd to have been <hi>French,</hi> but now defac'd, and not legible,</p>
            <p>HE approach'd <hi>Bellaria</hi>'s Ear, and awak'd her, in all the
Ecſtacy of a Man, who conſider'd himſelf, as diſtinguiſhed by <hi>Providence:</hi> He whiſper'd his new Hopes, of an immediate Redemption;
and found Means ſoon after, by Aid of an honeſt <hi>Jew,</hi> a Man of much
Charity, who viſited the Slaves every Morning, to be carried to the <hi>Alcaid</hi>; and, truſting his Gold with the <hi>Jew,</hi> propos'd to
ranſom <hi>Himſelf</hi> and <hi>Bellaria,</hi> whom he called his Brother:
But the Conflict of his Paſſions had ſo viſible an Effect, in his
Looks, and his Earneſtneſs, that the <hi>Alcaid</hi> took Advantage, from
what he obſerved, and inſiſted on the whole Sum, for the Liberty, of <hi>One</hi> only, which was offered him, for <hi>Both.</hi>—He bid him
name, at his Choice, either his Brother, or himſelf; but adviſed him to
loſe no Time, for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sloop was ready <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0199100801:45"/>
to ſail out of the Harbour, with ranſom'd Captives on Board, and would
carry him to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> where his Countrymen were in
Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon:—He added too, That all the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Slaves</hi> in <hi>Sallee,</hi> were to ſet out the next Morning, for <hi>Mequinez,</hi> to
work on ſome New Buildings of the Emperor of <hi>Morocco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Courthope</hi> trembled with Jealouſy; and a Thouſand
different Fears, at the diſtracting Imagination of <hi>Bellaria,</hi> in the
Eye and Power of ſuch a Tyrant!—He went out with the <hi>Jew,</hi> and
took a ſudden Reſolution.</p>
            <p>ABOUT Noon the ſame Day, the <hi>Jew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the
Priſon, and carried with him an Order for the Diſmiſſion of <hi>Bellaria</hi>; who, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after <hi>Courthope,</hi> was told, He went
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to prepare Things for her Reception, on Board the Veſſel, they
were to embark in; and had given him Orders to conduct her thither immediately.
Never was any Order obey'd with ſo much Tranſport; the <hi>Jew</hi> hir'd a
Boat, and attending her to the Ship, return'd, abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the Town, without
taking Leave of her:—She was led into the Cabbin, where, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to
find her Lover, ſhe was receiv'd by the Maſter of the Veſſel, with whom
the <hi>Jew</hi> had been before, and who deliver'd her a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſhe
open'd, with trembling Hands, and read in it, what follows.</p>

                     <salute>Mr. <hi>Plain-Dealer:</hi> SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>ALL Yours, yet publiſh'd, have regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd, and note
their Contents. I thought it proper to let you know, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am a <hi>Cooper,</hi> I lov'd her as well as her <hi>finical Turkey-Merchant.</hi>
But I forgot to let you know, firſt, That the needful of this Letter is, That
ſhe, that I mean, is a pretty, young Woman, worth a Brace and a half of <hi>Thouſands.</hi> But that makes nothing to the Story: I had <hi>Money
enough,</hi> for that Matter; and tho' I was no powder'd <hi>fine Fellow,</hi>
with a finical white Wig, yet I valued and eſteemed her, as if I had been the
Mother that bore her: And I ſhould have been glad, when Heaven ſaw fit, to
have had her in <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0199100801:49"/> her <hi>Smock!</hi> And ſo, <hi>mayhap,</hi> now I think on't, wou'd her Beau too; but I mean in an <hi>honeſt way</hi> only. But what matters that? <hi>Fair and Falſe</hi>
was an old Saying in its Time! And if I had ſtuck cloſe to my Calling, and
valued her no more than the Paring of my Nails, I had been a better Man for it,
by ſome <hi>Hundreds.</hi> But there is no ſetting <hi>Old Heads</hi> upon <hi>Young Shoulders.</hi> Every Body knows, I am no <hi>Bragſter</hi>; and,
tho' I ſay it, that ſhould not, I could have lov'd the very Ground that
ſhe <hi>went</hi> upon: And very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſhe has made me, that's certain;
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, I hope, ſomebody that is higher than ſhe, will remember her for
it, in the <hi>Laſt Day,</hi> for then all <hi>Secrets</hi> will be <hi>laid
open.</hi> I can't, for my Life, imagine, what poſſeſſes me, but I
ſhall begin to hate <hi>my own-ſelf</hi> ſhortly, if it was, in Nature,
to be poſſible, becauſe, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe comes into my Head, I am ready
to <hi>cry</hi> at the Thoughts of her.</p>
                  <p>NOW you muſt know, ſhe had told a Friend of mine, that <hi>wiſh'd</hi> me to her, not once, nor twice, but that very Day, that he
was leading her Home from <hi>Draper</hi>'s <hi>Gardens,</hi> That ſhe
thought, as how no Man could fall in Love with a <hi>Red-Hair'd Woman.</hi>
But, to ſee how ſtrangely Miſtakes will come about! this was all but her
own Fancy; for I never once thought of it; nor was never the Man, that had ever
concern'd my ſelf, with any Thing ſhe had about her. So, becauſe I
woud'n't be <hi>uncivil,</hi> I made a great Supper, <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0199100801:50"/> and
invited an old Aunt of mine, that ſhe <hi>know'd,</hi> and half a ſcore
young Women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides herſelf, to take Part of it: for it <hi>burnt</hi> in
my Mind, ſtrangely. In the middle of the Supper, I watch'd my Time, to drink
to her; and told her, before 'em all, That ſhe might be ſure, by my having
no Body to Supper, but <hi>Folks with Red Hair,</hi> as how I ſhou'dn't like
her a <hi>Crum</hi> the worſe, for <hi>That:</hi> For I didn't care a Pin,
for that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if ſhe was as <hi>red</hi> as a <hi>Fox,</hi> all over. To
be ſure, ſhe look'd, all Night, after it, as the <hi>Devil lookt over
Lincoln:</hi> And when I went, the Afternoon after, to <hi>make Love</hi> to
her, as I us'd to do, nothing vex'd me, but her ſending me down word, by that
pert Goſſip, Mrs. <hi>Briget,</hi> (that, I am ſure, has had of me, at
Times, in Preſents, beſides Good Words, to the Value of <hi>Five
Pieces!</hi>) and yet, ſhe bid <hi>Her, forſooth,</hi> to go and tell me,
That I had no need for giving my ſelf any more Trouble to come there; for her
Miſtreſs would have nothing to ſay to a <hi>Hoop-driver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW I, knowing, as how we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>forgive</hi> all
our <hi>Enemies,</hi> wou'dn't do her <hi>no Harm,</hi> for the World: And
ſo, hoping you will print this, <hi>only</hi> to <hi>expoſe</hi> her,
concludes the needful, at preſent, from</p>

            <p>BEING the other Day in a large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at a Gentleman's Houſe
in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> I was highly delighted, to hear a young beautiful <hi>Lady</hi> acknowledge that Tears flow'd from her Eyes, upon reading of the
Story of <hi>Courthope.</hi> She who had the <hi>Virtue</hi> to be ſo <hi>Elegantly moved</hi> by his <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> will reliſh an Account
of his better Fortune, which ſhe may hereafter expect to be <hi>Entertained</hi> with. But when ſhe added, <hi>That ſhe had been a</hi>
Coquette <hi>too long, and if ever it ſhould be her Fate to meet with a
Suitor of</hi> Courthope<hi>'s</hi> Deſert, <hi>ſhe would let him</hi>
loſe <hi>no Time, for Fear of Accidents:</hi> when I perceived ſhe made
this <hi>frank</hi> Confeſſion, not only with her <hi>Lips,</hi> but from
her <hi>Heart,</hi> I confeſs, I began to conceive Hopes of knowing very
ſpeedily, <hi>That ſome</hi> viſible Fruits <hi>would ariſe from
theſe my</hi> Labours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0199100801:55"/>I WAS therefore a little concern'd, when I
found my ſelf interrupted by a young <hi>Wag,</hi> who was pleaſed to
paſs Pertneſs upon the Company for <hi>Jeſting.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">'That PLAIN DEALER, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> is <hi>a
well-meaning Writer,</hi> but he does not ſtrike out a Meaning <hi>cleverly.</hi> This is one of the beſt Stories I have read, upon the
Subject of <hi>Love</hi>; only, there is not one <hi>Double-Meaning</hi>
through the Whole, and that makes it <hi>Inſipid.</hi> He has been <hi>generally</hi> hitherto, a perfect Inhabitant of his <hi>Blunt-Hall,</hi>
which ſeems to be, rather the <hi>Seat</hi> of his <hi>Underſtanding</hi>
than of his <hi>Perſon.</hi> But, ſince the <hi>Ladies like</hi> him, I
will endeavour to be of <hi>Their</hi> Mind, and eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he
tells us, he is an <hi>Old Batchelor,</hi> as well as a PLAIN DEALER, and we
muſt have ſome <hi>Humour</hi> ſtruck <hi>out of</hi> him, when he comes
to <hi>act</hi> that Character.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I GUESS'D what the young <hi>Malapert</hi> would be at by the Word <hi>Humour,</hi> and I found I was not deceiv'd, when he pulled out of his
Pocket a little Scrap of Poetry, intitled,—<hi>An Epiſtle from
Mrs.</hi> Robinſon <hi>to</hi> Seneſino,—in which he peremptorily
ſwore, <hi>There was a great deal of</hi> Turn, Life, <hi>and</hi>
Spirit.</p>
            <p>IT is certain, He ſhewed ſome <hi>Spirit</hi> in reading it,
and proved himſelf a <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> for he went <hi>boldly</hi> and <hi>undauntedly</hi> thro' it; and would never obſerve,
that every <hi>freſh Line</hi> excited <hi>freſh Bluſhes</hi> in the <hi>Faces</hi> of all the <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>Modeſt</hi> Part of the
Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0199100801:56"/>I TAKE this <hi>Opportunity</hi> of Informing
that young Spark (and all others of the ſame <hi>Claſs</hi> are deſired
to take <hi>Notice</hi> of it) That he is greatly miſtaken, if he expects any
ſuch Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour from me, notwithſtanding his <hi>irreverent</hi> way of
talking of his <hi>Elders,</hi> and throwing, over <hi>my</hi> Shoulder, a

            <p>IF, according to the <hi>Maxim</hi> in the Forehead of my <hi>Paper,</hi> it was my immediate Office to <hi>Teach</hi> that young Spark <hi>better</hi> Things, which I had then a great Inclination to <hi>Do,</hi>
only for Fear of <hi>diſcovering</hi> my ſelf, I would begin by <hi>Weeding</hi> out of his Mind that <hi>rank</hi> Conceit, which he
entertains of his Parts, and ſhewing him, that there is no <hi>true
Humour</hi> in <hi>Lewdneſs,</hi> nor <hi>true Wit</hi> in a <hi>Double
Entendre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW <hi>different</hi> was the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Waller?</hi> That Excellent Writer, as I have heard my old Friend Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> relate publickly at <hi>Will</hi>'s, in his Commendation,
uſed to ſay, <hi>That he would</hi> raze <hi>any</hi> Line <hi>out of
his</hi> Poems, <hi>which did not</hi> imply <hi>ſome</hi> Motive <hi>to</hi>
Virtue. This is a Saying that ought to be <hi>Memorable</hi> among our <hi>Poets</hi>; it carries with it the <hi>Energy</hi> of <hi>Good

only his <hi>Aſſurance</hi> ſeems conſiderable, (ſince he appears, by

            <p>THERE is a <hi>Livelineſs,</hi> and Race of <hi>Spirit,</hi>
which we commonly call <hi>Wit</hi>; but it is the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Natural Accident</hi>; and depends, like a <hi>Machine,</hi> upon <hi>Order</hi> and <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0199100801:62"/> 
               <hi>Parts.</hi> It is only the <hi>Reſult</hi> of a <hi>Mixture</hi> of <hi>different Humours:</hi> and of
Animal Spirits, <hi>finer</hi> and more <hi>delicately</hi> agitated, than
ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; which <hi>imprint</hi> in their Paſſage, a <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> Senſe of Images; and animate by that Impreſſion, the <hi>Viſage, Voice,</hi> and <hi>Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is merely by this Quickneſs, and Heat of their <hi>Imagination,</hi> that witty Men ſurprize us. A ſmart and ſprightly <hi>Rhetorick!</hi> A hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Turn of <hi>Phraſe!</hi> A frank Vivacity of <hi>Mien!</hi> with a <hi>modiſh Affectation</hi> of peculiar <hi>Looks,</hi>
and <hi>Geſture,</hi> make the <hi>Merit</hi> of their <hi>Character.</hi>
But theſe Men want, for the moſt Part, both <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>Penetration.</hi> Their <hi>Imaginations</hi> are <hi>thin,</hi> and <hi>delicate</hi>; and play <hi>lightly</hi> on the <hi>Skirts</hi> of <hi>Objects:</hi> But they are too <hi>weak</hi> for ſolid <hi>Reaſoning</hi>; and, in any Thing <hi>abſtracted,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Pitch</hi> of the <hi>Senſes,</hi> they are
miſerably <hi>Impotent,</hi> and grow preſently <hi>weary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY are the <hi>Ladies Favourites,</hi> however; by a Kind of <hi>Sympathy,</hi> or <hi>Reſemblance:</hi> For, <hi>Women,</hi> being
naturally of feeble <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> have their Brains of ſoft
Conſiſtence; with <hi>Fibres fine,</hi> and <hi>ſlender; apt</hi> and <hi>eaſy</hi> to be mov'd, by the <hi>weakeſt</hi> Agitations. They are <hi>ſubject</hi> therefore, to their <hi>Senſes</hi>; and wanting <hi>Force,</hi> to ſtrike <hi>deeper,</hi> ſet up for Judges of <hi>Modes,</hi> and <hi>Faſhions</hi>; and reliſh nothing, but what
contributes to their <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> or their <hi>Ornament.</hi> They have
fix'd the Standard of <hi>Wit,</hi> by certain <hi>Rules</hi> of this <hi>Tendency</hi>; and <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0199100801:63"/> find nothing ſo <hi>difficult,</hi> as to believe a Man can <hi>want</hi> it, who has ſuch <hi>Charms</hi> for <hi>their</hi> Entertainment.</p>
            <p>NED VOLATILE, a Member of our <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> at the <hi>Widow</hi>'s, is a <hi>Foreman</hi> of this <hi>Species.</hi> With a great
Extent of <hi>Good Nature,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Void</hi> of <hi>any</hi>; his
Facility to <hi>jeſt</hi> and <hi>rally,</hi> tranſports him, beyond <hi>Decency,</hi> to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> Objects, or <hi>debaſe</hi> 'em;
and, without regard to <hi>Ceremony, Merit,</hi> or <hi>Condition,</hi> he <hi>contracts</hi> Things, or <hi>magnifies</hi> them, when they fall in his
Way, 'till he has <hi>adapted</hi> them to his <hi>Talent,</hi> of preſenting
every Thing <hi>ridiculouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have the very <hi>Reverſe</hi> of this <hi>Character,</hi> in
the <hi>frank-hearted Major Stedfaſt:</hi> a Brave, and Able Officer, the <hi>Reward</hi> of whoſe <hi>Merit</hi> has been <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice</hi>! yet, ſo <hi>firm</hi> is the manly <hi>Generoſity</hi> of his Temper, that, at one and the ſame Time, he <hi>vindicates</hi> his Character with the Boldneſs of an <hi>injur'd</hi>
Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; and offers Arguments, in Excuſe for the <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> of
his Ruiner! Imputing to <hi>Credulity,</hi> and the <hi>Malice</hi> of
Miſrepreſenters, what his Friends, All, conſider as an Act of <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Barbarity.</hi> There is no <hi>Subject,</hi> which
he, oftner, or with more <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> enlarges on, than the <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>noble Qualities,</hi> of the Man who has <hi>undone</hi> him! Nay, he talks, even of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> with as
much <hi>Warmth</hi> and <hi>Seriouſneſs,</hi> as if he had, himſelf,
been oblig'd by it.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Ned Volatile,</hi> are the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South Poles</hi> of our <hi>Aſſembly. Ned
ſpeaks,</hi> 
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0199100801:64"/> and the <hi>Major thinks.</hi> The firſt
is always <hi>pleas'd,</hi> but the other always <hi>pleaſes.</hi> There is a <hi>Humanity</hi> in the <hi>Major</hi>'s <hi>Air,</hi> that never fails to
mark him out as the common Friend of the Company: and a kind of <hi>Majeſtick
Tenderneſs</hi> in his Behaviour, gives him the <hi>Authority</hi> of their <hi>Father.</hi> He corrects, and approves, with Openneſs; and is, at once, <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>amiable!</hi> There is a ſolemn <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Weight,</hi> in the Manner of his <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> which ſeems to
borrow its <hi>Equality</hi> from the <hi>Steddineſs</hi> of his <hi>Principles.</hi> He eſteems, without <hi>Tranſport</hi>; and condemns,
without <hi>Anger.</hi> What is <hi>Fancy</hi> in <hi>Ned Volatile,</hi> is <hi>Reaſon</hi> in the <hi>Major.</hi> The One has a <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that
is <hi>Solid</hi> and <hi>Plain:</hi> The Other an <hi>Imagination,</hi> that
is Sparkling and Wanton.</p>
            <p>IT is a very frequent, and agreeable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, which
ariſes to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> out of the natural <hi>Oppoſition,</hi>
of theſe two <hi>Characters</hi>; who yet preſerve a <hi>Decorum,</hi> by
Effect of the Regard each has for the other. The <hi>Major</hi> loves <hi>Ned</hi>'s Chearfulneſs; But thinks him <hi>trifling</hi> and <hi>impertinent:</hi> And <hi>Ned Volatile</hi> hears, with Reverence, the
Wiſdom of the <hi>Major</hi>; but would <hi>like</hi> him a great deal
better, if he would be <hi>merrier</hi> and more <hi>noiſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE had lately the Pleaſure of hearing, in a full Meeting, ſome
of the neweſt <hi>Opera Songs,</hi> by a skilful <hi>Italian Lady,</hi> who <hi>has been</hi> famous on our <hi>Theatres</hi>; and is equally remarkable
for the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of her <hi>Voice,</hi> and the <hi>Strength</hi>
of her <hi>Features!</hi> ſhe is an Acquaintance of the <hi>Widow,</hi> who
asked us, aſſoon as ſhe was gone, <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0199100801:65"/> our Opinion of
this Perſon, to whom, we all knew her <hi>Partial. Ned Volatile</hi>
prevented <hi>any</hi> Anſwer but his <hi>own</hi>; and deſir'd, He might
have Liberty to give it, <hi>under his Hand.</hi> He had Pen and Ink brought
him; and every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was grown <hi>Impatient</hi> for the Product of his <hi>Muſe,</hi> when he preſented it, in the following VERSES, from <hi>Randolph.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>NO ſooner had <hi>Ned Volatile</hi> repeated his <hi>Verſes,</hi> but a General Applauſe, of <hi>Laughter,</hi> was return'd
him by the Company. All but the <hi>Widow,</hi> the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>My-ſelf,</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly tranſported with the <hi>Humour</hi>
and the <hi>Satire:</hi> And <hi>Ned</hi> was triumphantly <hi>expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
his <hi>Poetry,</hi> with an Air of <hi>Levity,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi>;
when the <hi>Major,</hi> to prevent <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0199100801:66"/> a ſecond Reading, of
what he ſaw was <hi>diſtaſteful</hi> to ſome Part of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> began to ſpeak in this Manner.</p>
            <q> 
               <p>THE Company muſt acknowledge, they are oblig'd to Mr. <hi>Volatile,</hi> for the Pains he is at, to <hi>pleaſe</hi> them: But, if
he were as <hi>inclinable</hi> to <hi>reaſon,</hi> as he is to <hi>entertain,</hi> no Body could convince us ſooner, that the <hi>fineſt
Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule</hi> is to be conſidered but as <hi>Cruelty,</hi> where it borrows
its Subject from Mens <hi>Natural Defects,</hi> or their <hi>Miſeries.</hi> I
know very well, that whatever ſavours of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> is
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive in <hi>Converſation</hi>; and that nothing is more <hi>inſupportable,</hi> than a <hi>Liberty</hi> People take, of preſcribing <hi>Rules</hi> to all the World. We preſently wiſh to fly the Society of
thoſe who <hi>dogmatize:</hi> For the Mind of Man is Generous, and <hi>reſiſts</hi> Truth, or <hi>receives</hi> it, as its Approaches are <hi>Rude</hi> or <hi>Gentle.</hi> But then, there is an equal Inconvenience in
the <hi>contrary Extream:</hi> And if we wou'd enjoy Converſation, with a
Delicacy of <hi>Wit,</hi> we ſhould have Liberty to <hi>bound</hi> it, by the
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of our <hi>Judgment.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p>THE <hi>Harmony</hi> of this Lady, who has ſo agreeably
entertain'd us, is a <hi>Beauty</hi> that might weigh againſt the Abſence
of other Charms, more frequent, and perhaps leſs valuable! 'Tis the Motherly
Indulgence of <hi>Nature,</hi> to rob us of <hi>no</hi> Benefit, without
beſtowing on us ſome other, in a double Proportion. How ſeldom do we find <hi>all</hi> Accompliſhments united in the <hi>ſame</hi> Perſon!

               </p> 
               <p>I REMEMBER to have ſeen, during the laſt War in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in a Town where I had my Winter-Quarters, a wonderful
Example of this <hi>Recompence,</hi> obſerv'd by Nature. An old Man, who had
been born blind, and had always continued ſo, had a natural <hi>Sagacity,</hi> that was <hi>prodigious</hi> and ſcarce <hi>credible!</hi>
A Legacy being left him, to the Value of <hi>Fifty Piſtoles,</hi> the poor
Man, who had never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be Maſter of ſuch a Sum, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no
ſmall <hi>Solicitude</hi> how to ſecure his Poſſeſſion of it. He
determin'd, at laſt, to dig a Hole in the Cellar, and hide it: But it
happen'd, that a <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldier, who was quartered in the Houſe,
ſaw him bury the Purſe, and went afterwards and ſtole it. The Blind Man
bethinking himſelf of a Place <hi>more</hi> convenient, return'd, in an Hour
or two, and diſcover'd his Misfortune; for which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd an ingenious
Remedy, by <hi>detecting</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of it, which he judg'd to
have been <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0199100801:68"/> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldier; but the Difficulty
was, <hi>how</hi> to <hi>prove</hi> it.</p> 
               <p>THEY lay in the ſame Room; and, at Night, when they were in Bed,
the Blind Man began, under Pretence of Friendſhip and Confidence, to
conſult with the Soldier, concerning a Neceſſity which he ſaid, he was
under, to <hi>hide</hi> a <hi>hundred Piſtoles.</hi> To ſay Truth, added
he, I have <hi>hid fifty</hi> of them <hi>to Day</hi>; and would diſpoſe of
the <hi>other fifty</hi> in the ſame Place, to Morrow; only I am deſirous
to be ſatisfy'd, Whether, in Point of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ſuch a
Practice is <hi>unlawful?</hi> My Relations being ſo extravagant, that they
would <hi>waſte</hi> it all, if they could come at it.</p> 
               <p>THE <hi>Soldier</hi> ſwallowed the <hi>Bait,</hi> and <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,</hi> like a <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> to confirm the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
expecting, now, to get it <hi>all.</hi> He roſe, therefore, betimes, and
going into the Cellar, reſtor'd the fifty Pieces to the Hole, he had taken
them from: The Blind Man went, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and recover'd his Money, as he
expected, by the Succeſs of his Stratagem.</p> 
            </q>
            <p>HERE, the <hi>Major</hi> clos'd his <hi>Speech</hi>; and it was

            <p>THERE is Nothing more <hi>talk'd</hi> of and leſs eaſily <hi>found</hi> than <hi>Friendſhip</hi>; Every One <hi>Pretends</hi> to <hi>It,</hi> and not <hi>One</hi> in a <hi>Million</hi> really <hi>Poſſeſſes</hi> this <hi>Noble Paſſion,</hi> which is the moſt

            <p>FOR Want of Authentick and Real Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this <hi>Noble

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Beginning of the XVIth Century, the <hi>Portugueze</hi>
Carracks ſailed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> a very great Colony of <hi>Portugueze,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> Theſe Carracks are the
largeſt Veſſels that preſs the Ocean: On Board of one of them were
Twelve Hundred Souls, Mariners, Merchants, Paſſengers, Prieſts, and
Fryars, who were going on their ſeveral Miſſions eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Indies:</hi> The Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Voyage was
Proſperous; they had doubled the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> and were
ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> to the Continent of <hi>India,</hi> when
ſome Gentlemen on Board, having ſtudied <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy</hi> and <hi>Navigation,</hi> found in the Latitude in which they then were, a very
great Ridge of Rocks laid down in their Sea Charts; upon this, they apply'd
themſelves to the <hi>Captain</hi> 
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0199100801:72"/> of the Ship, and
acquainted him with the Danger which they apprehended, deſiring him at the
ſame Time, to communicate what they had diſcovered to the <hi>Pilot</hi>;
which Requeſt he immediately gratify'd, recommending to the <hi>Pilot</hi> to
lie by in the <hi>Night,</hi> and ſlacken Sail by <hi>Day,</hi> 'till they
ſhould be paſt the Danger. By the Diſcipline of the <hi>Portugueze</hi>
Navy, the Sailing Part is abſolutely committed to the Care of the <hi>Pilot,</hi> who is anſwerable with his Head, for the ſafe Carriage of
the King's Ship, and under no manner of Direction from the <hi>Captain,</hi>
who commands in all other Reſpects.</p>
            <p>INSTEAD of complying with ſo reaſonable a Requeſt, on which
the Safety of ſo many Lives depended, the inſolent <hi>Pilot,</hi> thinking
it an Affront to be taught in his own Art, crowded more Sail than he carried
before.</p>
            <p>THE Obſervations of theſe Gentlemen were too true, not to have
a fatal Iſſue: They had not ſailed many Hours, but juſt upon Break of
Day, (which would have been prevented if they had lain by) the Ship ſtruck
upon a Rock, and broke her Back.</p>
            <p>I LEAVE to the Reader's Imagination, what a Scene of Horror this
muſt be; the Fright of Twelve hundred Perſons in the ſame inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Danger, at the Sight of that inſtantaneous Death, which ſtar'd them in the
Face!</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Captain</hi> in this Diſtreſs, order'd the Pinnace to
be launch'd, into which, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toſs'd in a ſmall Quantity of
Biſcuit, and ſome few Boxes of Marmelade, he got himſelf 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0199100801:73"/> with nineteen others, who ſeeing the Danger of a Crowd
in the common Horror, ruſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Boat, drew their Swords and prevented
the coming in of any more: The ſame Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity oblig'd them immediately
to put off, leſt their Pinnace ſhould be drawn in by the Suction of the
ſinking Carrack.</p>
            <p>HERE their Eyes were entertain'd with the moſt diſmal of
Spectacles, the Sight of their ſinking Friends, and their Ears with the Cries
of ſo many in the ſame Miſery, whom they could not help without their own
Deſtruction; a Scene of Woe, which nothing could alleviate but the
Reflection, that they themſelves were not in the ſame Extremity, though
humanly ſpeaking, they were not in a much better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, being
deſtitute on the vaſt <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean, in an open Boat, without any
Compaſs to direct them, without any freſh Water, but what muſt fall from
thoſe Heavens, whoſe Mercy alone could deliver them. To which muſt be
added, the inevitable Danger of being overſet by the firſt Wind that
ſhould raiſe the Waves, beſides the Certainty of periſhing aſſoon
as their ſmall Stock of Proviſions ſhould be ſpent, which only ſerv'd
to prolong their Miſeries by reſerving them for a more lingring and cruel
Death. In this Diſtreſs, after they had for four Days row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to and fro,
without Guide or Direction, the Captain, who had been ſick, and very weak,
for ſome Time, overcome with Grief and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, died. This added, if
poſſible, to their Miſery, for now they fell into the laſt
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0199100801:74"/> Every one would Govern, and none would Obey:
This oblig'd them to chuſe one of their own Company to command them, whoſe
Orders they agreed implicitly, without any Reſerve, to follow.</p>
            <p>THE Choice fell upon a Gentleman, who was, what the <hi>Portugueze</hi> call a <hi>Meſtizzo,</hi> that is, one begotten between
an <hi>European</hi> and an <hi>Indian:</hi> This Perſon, veſted with his
new Authority, propoſed to the Company to draw Lots, and throw every fourth
Man overboard, by Reaſon their Proviſion was ſpent ſo far, as not to
laſt above three Days longer: They were now Nineteen Perſons in all; in
this Number were a Fryar and the Carpenter, both whom, they would exempt, by
Reaſon of their being ſo neceſſary, the One to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and Comfort
them in their laſt Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the other to take Care of the Boat, in
Caſe of a Leak, or other Accident; the ſame Compliment they paid to their
new Captain, he being the odd Man, and his Life of more Conſequence than any
of the reſt. He refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great while, but at laſt acquieſced; ſo
that there were four to dye out of the ſixteen remaining.</p>
            <p>THE Three firſt on whom the Lot fell, after having confeſs'd,
and receiv'd Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſubmitted to their Fate.</p>
            <p>THE Fourth, whom Fortune condemn'd, was a <hi>Portugueze</hi>
Gentleman who had a younger Brother in the Boat, who, ſeeing him about to be
flung over-board, moſt tenderly embraced <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0199100801:75"/> him, and with
Tears in his Eyes, beſought him to let him dye for him; enforcing his
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments by telling him, That, <hi>He was a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Man, and had a Wife and
Children at</hi> Goa, <hi>beſides the Care of three Siſters who
abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon him: That as for himſelf, he was ſingle, and
his Life of no great Importance; he therefore conjur'd him to let him ſupply
his Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Elder Brother aſtoniſh'd, and melted with this
Generoſity, replied, That <hi>ſince the Providence of</hi> GOD, <hi>had
appointed him, it would be wicked and unjuſt to ſuffer any other to dye for
him, eſpecially a Brother to whom he was ſo infinitely oblig'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Younger would take no Denial, but flinging himſelf on his
Knees, held his Brother ſo faſt, that they could not diſengage them: Thus
they diſputed for a while, the Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bidding him <hi>be a Father to
his Wife and Children, and as he would inherit his Eſtate, take Care of their
common Siſters</hi>; but all he could ſay, made him not deſiſt; This
was a Scene of Tenderneſs which muſt fill with Pity any Breaſt
ſuſceptible of generous Impreſſions!</p>
            <p>AT laſt, as it is no difficult Thing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade a Man to
live, the <hi>Conſtancy</hi> of the Elder Brother yielded to the <hi>Piety</hi> of the Younger; he acquieſced, and ſuffered the Gallant
Young Man to ſupply his Place; who being flung in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water, when he came
to it, could not be content to dye; but being a very good Swimmer, got to the
Stern of the Pinnace, and <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0199100801:76"/> laid hold with his right Hand;
which being perceiv'd by one of the Sailors, he cut off the Hand with a
Cutlaſs, upon which, dropping into the Sea, he caught hold again with his
Left, which received the ſame Fate by a ſecond Blow; thus diſmembered in
his two Hands, he made a ſhift, notwithſtanding, to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above
Water, with his Feet and two Stumps.</p>
            <p>THIS moving Spectacle ſo raiſed the Pity of the whole Crew,
that they cry'd out, <hi>He is but one Man, let us ſave him</hi>; which was
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done; and he taken into the Boat, had his Hands bound up as well
as the Place and Circumſtances would permit. They row'd all that Night, and
next Morning, when the Sun aroſe, as if Heaven would reward the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
and Piety of this Young Man, and for his Sake, ſave all the reſt, they
deſcry'd Land, which prov'd to be the Mountains of <hi>Mozam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> where the <hi>Portugueze</hi> have a Colony; hither they all
ſafely got, where they ſtaid 'till the next Ships from <hi>Lisbon</hi>
paſs'd by, and carried this Company to <hi>Goa</hi>; where <hi>Linſchotten,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Author of good Credit, aſſures us,
That he himſelf ſaw them land, ſupp'd with the two Brothers that very
Night, ſaw the Younger with his Stumps, and had the Story from both their
Mouths, as well as from the reſt of the Company.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hawthorn,</hi> my Neighbour, the <hi>Suſſex</hi>
Juſtice of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> came lately into the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi>
with a <hi>Mien,</hi> diſturb'd, and <hi>Martial.</hi> He ſwung his Arms,
like a <hi>Pendulum.</hi> His Face was fluſh'd, and flaming; and his whole
Geſture <hi>menacing.</hi> He puff'd and breath'd ſhort; ſat him down, in
one of the Windows; threw his Hat upon the Floor; and, as ſoon as he cou'd
ſpeak intelligibly, gave us loudly to underſtand, That he had been waiting,
ſix Hours, in a Tavern, without eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a furious
Determination, to <hi>break</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Vintner.</hi>—Is this, ſaid he, the Good-Breeding of your <hi>Welcome-mongers,</hi> that keep <hi>Taverns?</hi>—Is <hi>this,</hi>
the little, flattering, ſcraping, ſneering, wagtail <hi>Fellow,</hi> that
us'd to be ſo <hi>ready,</hi> and ſo <hi>nimble?</hi>—To rub his 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0199100801:79"/> Hands, and wriggle forward, like a Spaniel, to the
Street-End of his Entry?—<hi>Odsbobs!</hi> it was a lucky <hi>Reprieve</hi> for his <hi>Bones,</hi> that he was gone down to the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe!</hi> for I am verily convinc'd, that, in the <hi>Fury</hi> of my <hi>Heart,</hi> I ſhou'd have <hi>broke</hi> the <hi>King's Peace,</hi> tho' I had <hi>loſt</hi> my <hi>Commiſſion</hi>
for't.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Aſſembly</hi> was, by this Time, in a <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
Diſpoſition, betwixt <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</hi> when he
threw me a rumpled Paper, and <hi>nodded</hi> at me, to open it. I did ſo, in
ſome Confuſion, and, perceiv'd, it was a <hi>Letter</hi>; which, upon a
ſecond <hi>permiſſive Nod,</hi> I read, aloud, to the Company.</p>

tumbled down, from its Stand, and alarm'd one of his Drawers, who 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0199100801:81"/> was unſeaſonably Vigilant. The ſilly Rogue <hi>cry'd
out;</hi> and I, happening, at that Time, to be Drinking behind the <hi>Bar,</hi> run immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down; and, as Ill-Luck wou'd have it, came Time
enough to cut the Rope.—Great Endeavours were us'd, to compoſe his
ruffled Mind.—But, when he was told, the next Morning, in what Manner he
was preſerv'd, he grew deſperate, and uncomfortable; And nothing wou'd
ſerve his Turn, but his Rope muſt be <hi>paid for.</hi>—I have the

by the <hi>Manner</hi> of conferring them, the <hi>Alderman</hi> was obſerved
to have <hi>fix'd</hi> his Eyes on the Floor, in a Poſture of Thought, and
Sadneſs, that was very <hi>unuſual</hi> in him.—<hi>Ned
Volatile,</hi> who had juſt made a <hi>Tour,</hi> round the Table, to beg a
Pinch of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> from the <hi>Coquett</hi>'s <hi>Venetian
Snuff-Box,</hi> paſſing cloſe behind the <hi>Alderman,</hi> and
ſuppoſing him faſt aſleep, guided Part of it to his <hi>Noſe,</hi>
and rows'd him, into a Fit of <hi>Sneezing</hi>; which, as ſoon as he was
freed from, he looked round for <hi>Ned Volatile</hi>; and, after a <hi>Half

him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I KNEW, I owed this <hi>Favour</hi> to the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs of that
young <hi>Mad-cap</hi>; who is as full of <hi>Miſchief</hi> as a <hi>Monkey.</hi> He fancy'd, I was <hi>nodding</hi>; and, truly, I am ſorry,
that he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be miſtaken; for I was <hi>muſing,</hi> and very <hi>melancholy.</hi>—This Story of the <hi>Major</hi>'s brought afreſh
into my Mind an extraordinary Accident that I met with, my ſelf, in the Year
of the <hi>Great Froſt,</hi> that was before the <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MANY <hi>Loſſes,</hi> that Year, had diſabled me to make
good my Credit; ſo that I was <hi>run upon,</hi> by my Enemies; and gave
myſelf up for no Better than a <hi>Gone Man.</hi> But, one Morning,
early,—I ſhall never forget it!—I was juſt <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0199100801:85"/>
come down into my <hi>Counting Houſe,</hi> in my Night-Gown, and
Slippers;—when, in comes a Porter, and delivers me a Letter; and away he
goes, immediately, without asking for an Anſwer.—The Letter was from a
Merchant, that had formerly been my Beſt Friend; but we had <hi>broke
off,</hi> for ſome Years, upon my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to lend him a <hi>Thouſand
Pounds,</hi> upon his <hi>Bond</hi>; and we had never convers'd, ſince that
Time, till now, that he ſent this Letter; the Contents of which, were to tell
me, That he was ſorry to hear, what was reported abroad, to the <hi>Diſcredit</hi> of my <hi>Circumſtances</hi>; for he knew, it muſt be
owing to ſome <hi>unfortunate</hi> Accident; ſince, whatever <hi>Defects</hi> I had, I could never <hi>want Frugality.</hi>—But,
however, ſays he, If <hi>Five Thouſand Pounds</hi> can ſave you, call for
it when you pleaſe, and I will lend it you, by Way of <hi>Puniſhment,</hi>
for an <hi>Unkindneſs</hi> of Yours, formerly: And ſince the Mortification
This muſt give you, merits Pardon for your Fault, I will <hi>forget it,</hi>
from this Time forward, that we may be Friends again, as uſual.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Alderman</hi> interrupted himſelf in this Part of his <hi>Story,</hi> by a ſudden Burſt of <hi>Tears</hi>; which he ſtrove, in
vain, to ſuppreſs; and which affected the whole <hi>Aſſembly</hi> with
a <hi>Sympathy,</hi> more <hi>touching,</hi> than could have been excited by
the moſt pathetick Force of <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi>—He recover'd
himſelf, after a ſhort Pauſe, and went on, to inform us, That, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
leſs than a Week, after he had ſav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from <hi>Ruin,</hi> by
Receipt of this Money, his <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0199100801:86"/> generous Friend, the <hi>Merchant,</hi> fell out of a <hi>Boat,</hi> below Bridge, and was,
unfortunately drown'd.—It is true, continu'd the good <hi>Alderman,</hi>
I repaid it, very punctually, and have made all Acknowledgments, and done all
Services, in my Power, to his ſorrowful <hi>Widow,</hi> and his <hi>Children.</hi>—But, <hi>alas!</hi> What did all <hi>That</hi>
ſignify?—<hi>He</hi> was dead, that had <hi>Oblig'd</hi> me:—And <hi>gone,</hi> beyond all Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ever knowing how I <hi>repented</hi> my unkind Uſage of him! and what a <hi>Shame,</hi> and a <hi>Change,</hi> his <hi>Generoſity</hi> had produced in me!</p>
            <p>He would willingly have ſpoke more; but could not ſupport his <hi>Anguiſh</hi>;—and wept again, very paſſionately; ſo that
riſing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, he haſtened out of the Room, and left <hi>Us all</hi> in
great <hi>Diſorder.</hi>

            <p>I YESTERDAY went to ſee a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Friend, at whoſe
Houſe, I found a handſome Appearance of Young People of both SEXES. Upon my
Entrance, every one <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0199100801:87"/> roſe, and very obligingly proffered
me a Seat, each inſiſting on the Preference I ſhould give in Acceptance
of the Honour deſign'd me.</p>
            <p>AS I was unwilling to diſoblige any One, where All had treated
me with ſo much Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I wink'd at my Friend, who, with great Formality,
conducted me to a large Elbow-Chair; and put an End to the Diſpute.</p>
            <p>WHILE I was wondring with a ſecret Pleaſure, at ſuch an <hi>unaccuſtom'd</hi> Piece of <hi>Good-breeding,</hi> and examining the
Countenances of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, my Friend, who till then had diſcours'd of
indifferent Matters, told me with a Smile, <hi>He had aſſembled this Sett
of Young People, with a Promiſe of ſhewing them the</hi> PLAIN DEALER, <hi>and therefore deſir'd, I would throw</hi> aſide <hi>all</hi>
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs, <hi>and look upon</hi> every one <hi>as my</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
Admirer, <hi>and</hi> Friend, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately confirm'd by a <hi>General
Reverence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I THANK'D him for the <hi>Favour</hi> he had done me, in
introducing me to ſuch Agreeable Society; and could not help diſcovering by
my Looks, the inward Satisfaction I felt, at the Sight of ſo much <hi>Youth,</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi>; which ended in that melancholy Reflection, <hi>How many</hi> Dangers <hi>it was</hi> expos'd <hi>to, and how eaſily it
might be</hi> vitiated.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Tea-Equipage was remov'd, and every One remained ſilent
in Expectation of what I ſhould ſay, the Charming <hi>Leonilla,</hi> my
Friend's Eldeſt Daughter, after having firſt fix'd her Eyes on a Young Lady
that ſat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to her, and then on me, deſir'd in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0199100801:88"/> of Part of the Company, I would give my Opinion in the
Caſe of <hi>That</hi> Reſtriction <hi>Young Women lie under, who, from
a</hi> Cuſtom, <hi>which, in her Opinion, had no</hi> juſt Grounds <hi>for
its Support, are</hi> forbid <hi>by</hi> Decency, <hi>let their</hi>
Paſſion <hi>be the moſt</hi> vertuous <hi>and</hi> tender <hi>that was
ever felt, to make the leaſt</hi> Advance, <hi>by which the Party belov'd
may</hi> diſcover <hi>the</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents <hi>they have in his Favour.</hi>
To which I anſwer'd, <hi>A Woman of Senſe can never</hi> feel <hi>that</hi>
Tenderneſs <hi>for a</hi> Fool;—<hi>and a Man of</hi> Senſe <hi>would
always reckon ſuch a</hi> Declaration, <hi>a</hi> Deſire <hi>of</hi>
enjoying <hi>that</hi> Happineſs, <hi>whoſe</hi> Baſis <hi>is</hi> Love, <hi>and whoſe</hi> Support <hi>is</hi> Virtue.</p>
            <p>AFTER I had delivered my Opinion in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Leonilla,</hi>
I turn'd to the Lady, with whom (I could perceive by the Bluſh in her Cheeks)
ſhe had been diſputing, and told her, <hi>There was a</hi> falſe, <hi>as
well as a</hi> true <hi>Decency; and that</hi> One <hi>conſiſted in</hi>
Grimace <hi>and</hi> Shew, <hi>the</hi> Other <hi>in an</hi> open Deportment, <hi>the</hi> Reſult <hi>of an unaffected, diſintereſted</hi> Love <hi>of</hi> Virtue. <hi>And that it would always be found, a Man has no more
Reaſon to</hi> conceive Hopes <hi>from the</hi> free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <hi>of
the</hi> Latter, <hi>than to</hi> fear Succeſs <hi>from the</hi> diſtant
Carriage <hi>of the</hi> Former. True Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <hi>wants no Foil, and is never
talking of itſelf.</hi> Falſe Virtue, <hi>ſenſible of its</hi>
Weakneſs, <hi>is forc'd to have Recourſe to</hi> Hypocriſy, <hi>and is
ever boaſting a</hi> Strength <hi>it is a</hi> Stranger <hi>to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS I was running on in this grave Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I was
interrupted by a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who told us, he had juſt met with a Copy 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0199100801:89"/> of VERSES, ſaid to be written by Lady <hi>W—y

            <p>I HAVE as juſt a Veneration as any Man living, for the <hi>Laws</hi> of my Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: They are generous, mild, and gentle; built
on equal <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> And,
to ſay all, in a Word, they are ſuch, as every <hi>Freeman</hi> wou'd <hi>wiſh</hi> to be govern'd by. I am ſo far from denying them the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> 
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0199100801:93"/> they deſerve, that I have always

with which the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Robe</hi> fill their <hi>Writings,</hi> on this <hi>Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, ſince it is the moſt <hi>deſireable,</hi> among all the
Advantages of <hi>Liberty,</hi> to think, and ſpeak freely; it cannot, I
hope, be offenſive, if I declare myſelf not well ſatisfy'd, with any
Arguments I have, yet, heard, in Defence of <hi>Capital Puniſhment</hi> for
certain <hi>Crimes,</hi> which are low, and frequent: And which carry,
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, no Proportion, in Compariſon with others, of a much blacker
Complexion; to which notwithſtanding, they ſeem <hi>parallell'd,</hi> by
the Equality of their <hi>Sentence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Life</hi> of a Man is, ſo infinitely of more Value than
his <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or his <hi>Moveable,</hi> that, whenever I ſee the
Sufferings of pinch'd, and hunger-ſtarv'd <hi>Wretches,</hi> under the
Agonies of an <hi>Execution</hi>; for having <hi>robb'd</hi> perhaps to avoid <hi>famiſhing</hi>; I find myſelf oppreſs'd by a <hi>Grief,</hi> which
nothing mitigates, but this <hi>Reflection</hi>—That their <hi>Lives</hi>
were expos'd to ſuch Extremities of Want, and Miſery, that their <hi>Death</hi> ſhould be a Comfort.—And yet, the long protracted
Gazings, the Paleneſs, the Tremblings, and the ghaſtly, diſtorted Faces,
of the poor departing Strugglers (who die with ſtrong Reluctance, and linger,
and lengthen out, their laſt painful Moment) make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to the <hi>Beholders,</hi> That, Unfriendly as the World was to them, they are not
willing to forſake it.</p>
            <p>

the neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, either of the <hi>Wants,</hi> or the <hi>Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> of the loweſt Part of the <hi>Human Species.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ONE Evening, very lately, All my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, in <hi>Barbican,</hi> were in an Uproar, on a ſudden; and I was diſturb'd, in
my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, by the ſhrieking of Women, the mix'd Cries of Children, and
a growing <hi>Hum</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that ſeem'd cloſe under my
Window.—I threw aſide my Pipe; and, haſtening to look out, ſaw the
Street entirely fill'd, by a <hi>Groupe</hi> of diſmal Faces; that had
gather'd themſelves into a Tumult, about a Houſe, directly oppoſite, and
appear'd to be touch'd, as ſtrongly as Common Natures are capable, with a
Mixture of <hi>Surprize</hi> and <hi>Sorrow.</hi> It ſeems, the Husband of a
laborious, poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0199100801:95"/> who was Miſtreſs of this
Houſe, had been condemn'd, at the County Aſſizes, in one of the late
Circuits, for ſtealing a Horſe: And a Letter had, juſt now, been
deliver'd to his Wife; which the Criminal himſelf had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the very
Morning he was executed.</p>
            <p>HIS Relations and Acquaintance had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on a <hi>Reprieve</hi>; for the Man was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally belov'd among his Neighbours:
And, tho' always very poor, and unfortunate in his Dealings, had been
remarkable for his Induſtry; of a ſober Diſpoſition, and never known,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to have been guilty of the leaſt Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. He had Six
Children alive, and the Eldeſt but Eight Years old. His Mother, who liv'd in
the ſame little Houſe, had been diſabled, by Sickneſs, for ſeveral
Months paſt: So that, perceiving it beyond his Power to ſubſiſt his
Family any longer, and not daring to ſtay in Town, by Reaſon of ſome
Debts he had contracted, he went down, to <hi>try his Friends,</hi> who liv'd,
in good Circumſtances, in the Country. But, inſtead of meeting with <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> he only ſpent, in this Journey, all the little he
had carried with him: And not being able to ſupport the Thoughts of
return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>without Bread,</hi> to a Family, in ſuch want of it, he rode
away with a Horſe, which he found ty'd to a Gate; and being purſu'd, and
overtaken, was try'd, condemn'd, and hang'd, for it.</p>
            <p>THIS Hiſtory was loudly given me, by the good Women, in the
Street; after which, <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0199100801:96"/> I had the Curioſity to preſs in,
among the Crowd; and was ſtruck, at my firſt Entrance, by the moſt <hi>moving</hi> Scene of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> that I ever remember to have met
with. The Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow had broke open her Husband's Letter, in Tranſport,
concluding, That it brought her the Confirmation of a <hi>Reprieve,</hi> which
a former had given her Hopes of. But ſhe was ſo ſhock'd, and overwhelm'd
by the ſudden Reverſe of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that her Grief was a kind of <hi>Madneſs.</hi> She ſat on the Floor without Headcloaths; and had an
Infant, croſs her Knees, that was crying, with great Impatience, for the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> it had been thrown from. Another <hi>ſlept</hi> in a <hi>Cradle,</hi> cloſe by a little <hi>Bed,</hi> in which the <hi>Grandmother</hi> ſat weeping; bending forward in ſtrong Agony; and
wringing her Hands in ſilence. The Four Eldeſt Children were gather'd into
a Knot, and clung about the Neck of their miſerable Mother: <hi>ſtamping,
ſcreaming,</hi> and <hi>kiſſing her,</hi> in a Storm of diſtracted <hi>Tenderneſs!</hi>—The poor Woman, <hi>herſelf,</hi> was in a
Condition, <hi>paſt deſcribing!</hi> She preſs'd the Letter of her <hi>dead Husband,</hi> to her <hi>Eyes!</hi>—her <hi>Lips!</hi>—her <hi>Boſom!</hi>—She rav'd, and talk'd, and queſtion'd him, as if he
had been preſent!—And, at every little Interval, dry'd her <hi>Tears,</hi> with his <hi>Letter:</hi> And caſt a Look upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
ſo <hi>wild!</hi> and ſo full of <hi>Horror!</hi> that it cannot be
conceiv'd, but by thoſe, who were Witneſſes of it.</p>
            <p>AS ſoon as ſhe ſaw <hi>me</hi> there, ſhe ſtretched out
her Hand; and made Signs, that I ſhould read <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0199100801:97"/> the Letter;
which I received from her, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. And going back, to my Lodging, with a
Reſolution to ſend over ſome fitter Perſon than myſelf, to
aſſiſt, in the Diſtreſſes of ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate a Family, I
ſat down, and took a Copy of it, becauſe it <hi>moved</hi> me
exceedingly.</p>

            <p>I carry'd this Letter with me to the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:</hi> where
it was univerſally Agreed, That there is a plain-hearted Honeſty, very
mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in all Parts of it; and a generous and manly Sorrow, not ariſing
ſo much from his own Deſire to <hi>Live,</hi> as from a Proſpect of <hi>their Wants,</hi> whom his Death was to leave <hi>Deſtitute.</hi> Our
Clergyman, in particular, was greatly mov'd to Compaſſion; and propos'd a
Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Collection, to be ſent to the poor <hi>Widow,</hi> to which
himſelf contributed <hi>firſt,</hi> in a very liberal Proportion.</p>
            <p>He related to us afterwards an extraordinary <hi>Dying
Speech,</hi> of a very different Turn; which he heard made when a <hi>Student,</hi> by a Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker, who was hang'd for <hi>Murder</hi> and
a <hi>Robbery.</hi>

               <hi>GOOD People, ſaid the Criminal,</hi> ſince I am to ſerve
you, for a <hi>Sight,</hi> the leaſt you can do, is to be <hi>Civil</hi> to
the Man that <hi>entertains</hi> you. I ask nothing of you, but the Juſtice,
that is due to me. There are ſome medling Tongues, <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0199100801:100"/>
which I can hear among the Crowd, very buſy to incenſe you. Tho' it is
true, I have <hi>committed Murder,</hi> yet I hope I am <hi>no Murderer.</hi>
The <hi>Felony</hi> I really purpos'd; but my <hi>Intention</hi> had no part in
the <hi>Death</hi> that I was Guilty of. The Deceas'd cry'd for Help, and was
ſo Obſtinate, and Clamorous, that I was under a Neceſſity to <hi>kill</hi> him; or ſubmit my ſelf to be taken. And thus I argued in my
Mind. If I <hi>Murder</hi> him, I ſhall <hi>get off;</hi> or, at worſt, if
I am taken, my Puniſhment will be <hi>no greater,</hi> than if I ſpare him,
and <hi>Surrender:</hi> I can be <hi>BUT HANG'D</hi> for <hi>Murder,</hi> and I
muſt be <hi>HANG'D TOO,</hi> for the <hi>Houſe-breaking!</hi> This Thought,
Good People, prevail'd with me to <hi>Shoot</hi> him; ſo that what <hi>you</hi> call <hi>Murder,</hi> was but <hi>Self-Preſervation.</hi> Now
that I ſhou'd have dy'd in this <hi>ſame Manner,</hi> whether I had Shot
him, or no, Witneſs theſe two <hi>Weak Brothers</hi> here, who look as if
they were already at the other End of their <hi>Voyage,</hi> tho' they have not <hi>hoiſted Sail</hi> yet! one of theſe <hi>Stole ſome Bacon,</hi> and
the other, a <hi>wet Smock or two.</hi> The <hi>LAW</hi> muſt be certainly <hi>Wiſer</hi> than <hi>you are;</hi> and ſince <hi>that</hi> has been
pleas'd to ſet our Crimes on a <hi>Level,</hi> be ſo civil or
compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate as to hold your ſilly Tongues, and let me <hi>die,</hi>
without <hi>Slander.</hi>

            <p>We had ſeveral other Stories, on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, of the <hi>Publick Executions:</hi> but none pleas'd me better, than one, which I

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0199100801:101"/>THE late King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd a Soldier to <hi>die</hi>; and ſtood at a little Diſtance from
the Place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Fellow, when he heard this, was in hopes of a <hi>Pardon</hi>; but being aſſur'd he was miſtaken, cry'd, his <hi>Tongue</hi> was yet <hi>free,</hi> he wou'd uſe it, at his Pleaſure;
which he did, with great Licenſe; accuſing the King, moſt inſolently,
and as loud as he cou'd ſpeak, of <hi>Barbarity</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to God, for <hi>Revenge</hi> of his <hi>wrong'd Innocence.</hi> The King not hearing him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, enquir'd
of thoſe about him, <hi>What the Soldier had been ſaying?</hi> and was
told, by a General Officer, who was unwilling to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Reſentment
againſt the <hi>Miſerable,</hi> That he had only repeated, very often and
loud, <hi>That God loves the Merciful, and teaches the Mighty to moderate their
Anger.</hi> The King was touch'd by the <hi>Leſſon,</hi> and ſent his
Pardon to the Criminal. But a Courtier of an oppoſite Intereſt, took
Advantage of this Occaſion, and repeated to the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the
Licentiouſneſs of the Fellow's <hi>Railing</hi>; adding gravely when he had
done, That Men of Quality, and Truſt, ought never, in his Opinion, to <hi>miſrepreſent Facts to their Sovereign.</hi> The King for ſome Time
ſtood ſuſpended in his Thoughts, but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length toward the
Courtier, with a Face of Reproof, <hi>It is the firſt Time,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that ever I have been betrayed for my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage!</hi>

            <p>WELL! If this ſhould, in good Earneſt, come to paſs, I

in the Progreſs of my PAPERS. But let it prove what it will, the Occaſion
of this Preamble is from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Diſorder, in which I am come Home this
Evening, after a kind of frolickſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, with that young <hi>Romp</hi>; which has left me under an Impreſſion, little better than <hi>Witchcraft</hi>; tho' at any Time before <hi>laſt Eaſter,</hi> I

            </p>
            <p>TO Day, when ſhe <hi>hoyden'd</hi> into the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the
whole Company roſe together, and received her with that Pleaſure, which her <hi>Gayety</hi> diffuſes every where. She ſailed through us all, with a <hi>ſwimming, ſmiling Port,</hi> that was viſibly <hi>affected,</hi> but
irreſiſtably enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging!—When ſhe had flutter'd, and fidget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and
ſloped her ſelf forward, and wheel'd down her Hoop, to the wideſt Swell
of its <hi>Convex,</hi> in a Circular Courſe of <hi>Curteſies</hi>; ſhe
tript ſideways to her Seat; and I was juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0199100801:104"/>
to hope <hi>Calm Weather,</hi> after ſuch a <hi>Whirl-wind</hi> of <hi>Ceremony!</hi> when ſhe roſe, as it were in a <hi>Start,</hi> with a
Look moſt <hi>whimſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Serious</hi>; and drawing a Paper from her
Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, pac'd demurely to <hi>my Chair</hi>—She carry'd her Head to the
left ſide, ſoftly ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her right Eye-Brow, with the <hi>Knob</hi> of
her <hi>Fan,</hi> and ſinking forward, when ſhe came near me, with a
Fantaſtical Air of Languiſhment, bruſh'd my Mouth with her Paper; and
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play over her Tricks, in a long and myſtical <hi>Jargon</hi> of <hi>moſt Womaniſh Impertinence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND were they,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſo naughty, to leave
it by it's nown ſelf? And did no body help it to write it's</hi>
PLAIN-DEALERS? <hi>and was it abus'd, and over-work'd and neglected? Well then,
let it be Good, and mind it's Book, and waſh it's Face, and forget to be
croſs, and comb it's Head, and throw away it's dirty Stick; and ſee what I
intend to do for it! There take it, and Print it; And, don't care a Pin for the
Work they have put upon it. For I love it, and will think for it; and bring it
good Things. And if it wou'dn't look Grim, I ſhould buſs it, and ſtroak
it, and chuck it under the Chin; and make much of it, and play with it,
and</hi>—&amp;c.—&amp;c.—&amp;c.—</p>
            <p>AFTER this ſilly Rate, ſhe ran on, with a ridiculous, but
lively and never-ending Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: and perceiving, that the Company laugh'd
out, and were diverted at the groteſque Figure I was making under her Hand's,
at length ſhe kiſs'd me out-right, and ſet 'em all, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0199100801:105"/>
in an <hi>Uproar.</hi> I wou'd fain have look'd peeviſh. I turn'd my Face
from her, and cry'd <hi>Piſh</hi>—and <hi>Pſhaw</hi>—and <hi>Fiddle</hi>—and ſhook my Head in a great Heat, and winch'd in both
Shoulders; and much Pains I took, to ſeem nettled, and uneaſy. But, to
confeſs a fooliſh Truth, it was all, but <hi>mere Show</hi>; for I was
never ſo agreeably made an Aſs of in my Life, and while I felt the buſy
Wanderings of her Fingers about my Face, I was ſtung I can't tell how, with a
Kind of tingling Delight, all over me; which being deſirous to prolong, I
pretended to make Efforts for puſhing her away; and under that Pretence, gave
my Hands the Opportunity of <hi>touching</hi> her, here and there—And I
muſt own, I was ſorry when ſhe put an End to her <hi>Gambols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT as ſoon as I came home, and look'd into her Paper, I was not
ſo much an <hi>Aſs,</hi> (far gone as I found My-ſelf) but that I
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcern'd her <hi>Drift:</hi> And I wiſh, with all my Heart,
that I had Courage enough to return it her; and tell her, in downright Terms, <hi>I don't think it worth Printing.</hi> But whatever the Cauſe of this
ſtrange Alteration may be, there is nothing ſo dreadful to me, as the
Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of diſobliging this <hi>She-Cockatrice!</hi> Since therefore, I am in
this odd Manner, <hi>bewitch'd,</hi> e'en take it, in the <hi>arch Flirt's</hi>
own Words: For it is no Work of mine; and I will have nothing to do with
it.</p>

                        <p>IN the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> the City
of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was much throng'd with <hi>Foreigners</hi>; for

Magick</hi> and <hi>Tumbling</hi>; and ſuch <hi>unſpeakable</hi> Additions,
as were fitteſt to give Pleaſure to the <hi>Eyes</hi> of <hi>Goths,
Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> to whom <hi>Plays, alone,</hi> were
inſipid, becauſe acted in a Language, which they were, in a Manner, wholly
Strangers to.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>THEODORA,</hi> the Empreſs, had been formerly a <hi>Comedian,</hi> and was a liberal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of whatever cou'd contribute to
make Pleaſure pompous. Among the Numbers, who found their Intereſt in this <hi>Byas</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> there was a wily and egregious <hi>African</hi>; whom for the Flatneſs of his Noſe, the Tawnineſs of his
Complexion, and a certain <hi>Majeſtical Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> in the
Compoſition of his Features, the merry <hi>Greeks</hi> had nicknamed the <hi>LYON.</hi> This Man became rich, by the univerſal Encouragement, that was
given to an odd Project, of his ſtarting.—It was a Kind of <hi>Blind-Buzzard,</hi> or <hi>Midnight-Mummery</hi>; of which it is difficult,
at this great Diſtance of Time, to conceive a clear Notion: But Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of
the higheſt Rank, of both Sexes, met there, diſguis'd, and under borrow'd
Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0199100801:107"/> danc'd, regal'd, and diſcours'd with

Diſtinction,</hi> or <hi>Punctilio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT was generally allow'd, however, by all but the <hi>LYON</hi>'s Enemies, that nothing paſs'd in theſe Meetings, either
Scandalous or Misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming: Every thing was Magnificent, Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and
Enlivening: But no <hi>Privacies</hi> were permitted, nor <hi>Indecencies</hi>
connived at.</p>
                        <p>IT fell out, notwithſtanding, moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately for
the <hi>LYON,</hi> That <hi>Religion</hi> was at this Time very flaming, and
watchful. The <hi>Good Fathers</hi> of the Church became ſcandalized, and
alarm'd, at the Probability of <hi>Impurities,</hi> in this new-invented <hi>Nightwork:</hi> For, it was dangerous, they knew, to allow ſuch Latitude
to their <hi>Female Flock,</hi> while their Shepherds were at Reſt, who kept
the <hi>Wolf</hi> from <hi>biting</hi> them. They determine, therefore,
vigorouſly to <hi>remonſtrate</hi> againſt it. But there was One
conſiderable <hi>Rub,</hi> that lay full in their Way. The <hi>Emperor
himſelf</hi> was often preſent at theſe Meetings, and indulg'd them, as
an innocent, and agreeable Recreation.</p>
                        <p>TO Remove this heavy <hi>Difficulty,</hi> the <hi>Good
Fathers,</hi> with great <hi>Dexterity,</hi> charg'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of their <hi>Fears,</hi> upon the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of the <hi>Women,</hi> whoſe
Natures, they ſaid, were liable to very dangerous <hi>Impreſſions,</hi>
from thoſe Whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Squeezings, and Inflammations of their <hi>Vanity.</hi> They went on to aſſert, That a <hi>Woman</hi>'s Defence
againſt <hi>Man,</hi> lying rather in her Dread of <hi>Shame,</hi> than her
Abhorrence of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> 
                           <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0199100801:108"/> ſhe ſhou'd never be

                        </p>
                        <p>IT is one Thing to be <hi>Pious,</hi> and another to be <hi>Wiſe.</hi> The Warmth of their <hi>Zeal</hi> had not ſuffer'd them to
conſider, That there were <hi>Women</hi> of <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> who would vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their <hi>Sex's Honour</hi>; and make
uſe of their powerful <hi>Influence,</hi> to oppoſe the good <hi>End</hi>
of theſe Reverend Memorialiſts, were it for no other Reaſon but becauſe
the Means were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly. <hi>THEODORA,</hi> the Empreſs, was provok'd to
the laſt Degree; and after reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Partiality,</hi> and the
mean and falſe <hi>Idea's,</hi> which they had conceiv'd, of <hi>Womens
Virtue,</hi> fell to reaſon with them in this Manner.</p>
                        <q>HOW Contemptibly wou'd your <hi>Sex</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel us to

            <p>LITTLE Follies, which we but Smile at in Perſons who are Indifferent
to us, gives us Sorrow and Pain, when obſerv'd in thoſe we Love. <hi>Patty
Amble</hi> is of late become of ſuch Importance, that I watch her with a
Tenderneſs, that intereſts me in all her Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For this Reaſon, I am
frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving to interrupt Her, when ſhe lets her Tongue run Races,
that out-gallop her Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But I always loſe my Labour: My Operations
upon this <hi>Goſſip</hi> are like the <hi>Wind's</hi> upon <hi>Fire</hi>;
I may blow till my Breath fails,—inſtead of <hi>putting her out,</hi> I
make her <hi>burn</hi> but the <hi>faſter!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE ſucceeded however, in what I fail'd to do <hi>My-ſelf,</hi>
by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Ned Volatile,</hi> But not to aſſume more
Triumph than is due to me, the Stratagem I made uſe of, was found out by <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> before me. That Poetical Politican taught his <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, among the reſt of his ſurprizing Victories, to
conquer <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0199100801:112"/> a <hi>Woman</hi>'s <hi>Tongue</hi>; but it was
by Aid of one of his <hi>Drums,</hi> which no ſooner Beat up, but the Enemy
was put to Silence.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall now enjoy ſome Freedom, and may all Talk in our Turns;
for <hi>Ned,</hi> and the <hi>Coquet,</hi> will be play'd off at Pleaſure.
When either of 'em grows Troubleſome, we ſhall let looſe the <hi>Rival,</hi> and like <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> one ſhall
blow up the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PATTY AMBLE</hi> came Yeſterday fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreſs'd to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi>; ready to burſt with Impatience for our Admiration of
her Fancy. She kept us Silent above an Hour, while ſhe was ſo kind as to
open to us the Labours and Difficulties, ſhe had for fourteen Days been <hi>fatigu'd</hi> by, before ſhe cou'd unite ſo elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all her trifling
Varieties. From her Head to her Foot, ſhe oblig'd us with the Minutes of her
whole Fortnight's Hiſtory. It was not to be expected, that in the midſt of
ſo much Buſineſs, ſhe cou'd be at Leiſure to conſider, That after
we had approv'd both the Price, and Colour of her <hi>Damask,</hi> it was of no
great Edification, at leaſt to the <hi>Male</hi> Part of the Company, to know
what <hi>Shop</hi> ſhe bought it at. But happy had it been cou'd ſhe have
found <hi>Reſt</hi> ſo ſpeedily! Nothing like it, I aſſure you; we
were alſo to learn, in what Places ſhe <hi>miſs'd</hi> it. Yet for my own
Part, I <hi>muſt ſay,</hi> I was particularly <hi>edify'd</hi> by her
cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Remarks, on certain Differences to be found, betwixt buying on <hi>Ludgate-Hill,</hi> or of the Mercers about <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0199100801:113"/>BUT ill fare, ſay I, that unlucky Word <hi>Garden!</hi> It put her fatally in Mind of a Fat freſh-colour'd <hi>Country Lady,</hi> who cou'd never be perſuaded to make Viſits, in any
thing but <hi>Garden Silks,</hi> tho' her Arms were as big as a <hi>Rolling-Stone!</hi> Then the unfortunate Word <hi>Fat,</hi> brought as
aptly to her Remembrance, poor old <hi>Dimpley</hi> the laughing Staymaker,
that us'd to Work for her <hi>Grandmother,</hi> when firſt ſhe was Married!
and never <hi>lac'd</hi> our <hi>Patty,</hi> when ſhe was a Girl, but ſhe
made her <hi>very Neck ake</hi> with twiſting it to look back at him. At
length, after infinite Diſappointments and Dangers, ſhe arriv'd ſafe at
her <hi>Hoop-Petticoat</hi>; where, being ſeiz'd with a <hi>Fit</hi> of
Gratitude for the Parliament's <hi>ſtrange good Nature,</hi> and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Care of <hi>Trade,</hi> ſhe was <hi>thinking to turn
WHIG,</hi> becauſe they had taken off the <hi>Duty,</hi> that lay ſo heavy
upon <hi>Whalebone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WELL, as to that however, ſhe was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo poſitive.
But there was one Thing, of more Conſequence, that ſhe was abſolutely <hi>convinc'd of</hi>; ſhe wou'd venture any <hi>Wager,</hi> that not one
Perſon in the Company, cou'd be able to <hi>gueſs,</hi> what her <hi>Ground
Bruſſels Head</hi> had coſt her a Yard; nor where, nor by what particular <hi>odd,</hi> Accident, ſhe had been ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to <hi>light of it!</hi>
The Dutcheſs of <hi>M—r</hi> took Coach in a Fright, the very Moment
ſhe ſaw it, to buy up the <hi>Remnant.</hi> But ſince ſhe was ſure we <hi>cou'd not gueſs,</hi> ſhe wou'd tell us the Price <hi>her ſelf</hi>;
and not name one Farthing more or leſs than it really coſt her; ſhe
wonder'd, <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0199100801:114"/> for her Part, how Women cou'd be <hi>ſo
ſilly!</hi> For what ſignify'd after all, the little <hi>Vanity</hi> of
being <hi>thought skill'd in good Penny-worths!</hi> If ſhe had a mind to be <hi>Vain,</hi> ſhe need only believe, what was ſaid to her at the <hi>Opera,</hi> by a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Duke,</hi> who muſt be nameleſs! But one
Thing his Grace was pleas'd with, that ſhe <hi>might</hi> venture to ſpeak
of, and it was <hi>that Fancy of her own upon her Fan!</hi> Lord! ſhe
remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd too he obſerv'd, That there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in a Lady's <hi>Fan,</hi> much <hi>genteeler in its Uſe,</hi> than any part of the <hi>Mens Equipage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was juſt in this Place, that I took Pity of the Company; for I
thought I <hi>felt their Heads ake!</hi> So tipping the Wink on <hi>Ned
Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile,</hi> he ſtarted up from his Chair, with ſuch a <hi>Stare</hi> of
Amazement, that one wou'd have thought he was apprehenſive the Houſe had
been falling! The <hi>Coquet</hi> ſtarted too, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Tongue till
ſhe cou'd look round her, <hi>Ned,</hi> with wonderful Agility, ſnatch'd
the <hi>Nick</hi> of that Interval; and reſolving at once to bear down all
Oppoſition, broke in upon her, like a Torrent, with this ſudden
Exclamation, 
<q rend="inline">'<hi>Ah! Madam! Madam!</hi> What a <hi>Trifle</hi> is
a <hi>Fan,</hi> in Compariſon with a <hi>Feather!</hi> I ſhou'd be ſorry
to diſſent from any Opinion <hi>you</hi> are fond of; but pray let your
Reaſon be Judge of this Difference! I have <hi>one,</hi> in my Hat here, that

examine it, the more it will charm you! With all your <hi>Wit</hi> now, and

you theſe three Hours to <hi>gueſs where I bought it?</hi> I can't be
altogether ſo poſitive, that you won't hit the <hi>Price</hi> of it; but
upon my Honour, if you <hi>ſhou'd,</hi> I'll acknowledge it to a Farthing.
There's <hi>ſome Pleaſure</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing on theſe <hi>critical
Affairs,</hi> with ſo nice a Judge as <hi>you, Madam!</hi> Why here's a <hi>Coat,</hi> I have worn this five Weeks, and not one in fifty has had the <hi>Taſte</hi> to take Notice, that all the Wool it was made of, is <hi>true

And for clearing Things more effectually to your Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I ſhall,

the Lord knows whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make Butter and Cheeſe in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> Yet in this Place, to do her Juſtice, ſhe kept us

as her <hi>Aunt</hi> was. We all learnt to <hi>Brew</hi> and <hi>fatten

Parent, near the <hi>Beauties</hi> of the other; becauſe this Manner of
Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Oppoſites, in Writing, like <hi>Shade</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> in Painting, will make the <hi>Moral</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with <hi>Vigour,</hi> and ſtrike upon the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> a more forcible <hi>Effect.</hi>

            <p>COULD I execute this <hi>Deſign</hi> according to my <hi>Wiſh</hi>; could I make the <hi>Draught</hi> juſt, and give it the <hi>Lively Touches</hi> and <hi>warm Colours</hi> it deſerves, it might
perhaps be a valuable <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> and <hi>inſtructive Family
Piece,</hi> for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Part of my <hi>Readers,</hi> and ſome of their
Poſterity might, for ought I know, have good Reaſon to thank me for it.</p>
            <p>I WAS, according to Cuſtom, opening my Mind upon this intended <hi>Subject</hi> to the worthy Major <hi>Stedfaſt</hi>; and telling him, That
I ſhould be agreeably loſt in Pleaſure, while I was tracing, in a good
Father, the ſecret <hi>Springs</hi> of a Thouſand little Beautiful <hi>Actions</hi> which would paſs unnoticed by common Eyes, that are too
Incurious and Indelicate on ſuch Nice and Elegant Occaſions.</p>
            <p>—HERE I pauſed a while, with Intent to name ſome particular
Obſervations, I have made, of theſe Critical Workings of a <hi>Spirit</hi>
truely <hi>Parentile</hi>; when this conſtant Friend of Mankind changed my
Inclination to ſpeak, into the greater Pleaſure of attending to what he
began to ſay, in this Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0199100801:122"/>THERE is, no fear of your loſing yourſelf in
that Delightful Part of the Contemplation: But when you come to conſider the <hi>Unnatural Mother,</hi> I don't know how difficult a Task it may be, even
for all your <hi>Philoſophy</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it. You will find yourſelf
extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed, if you deſcend to make Enquiry, what Monſtrous Turn
in the whole Courſe of the Blood, what Prodigies over-ruling the whole
Rational and Animal Syſtem, can Eraze from a <hi>Mother's Heart</hi> all
thoſe fond <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> which the Hand of
Nature muſt have engraven there, in behalf of the <hi>Being</hi> which
received its firſt Principle of <hi>Vitality</hi> ſo near it, and its
immediate Preſervation from it.</p>
            <p>YOU may remember that, at your ſetting out, I told you, the
Expreſſion, which hit my Taſte the beſt of any in your <hi>Firſt</hi>
PAPER, was, <hi>That you would look upon yourſelf as every Body's
Father;</hi> and I would rather ſee you acting like a Father, than
deſcribing one: which ſaid he (giving into my Hand a Paper) you may do, by
publiſhing thoſe <hi>Verſes,</hi> which, according to my Opinion, want
nothing more than their being <hi>Known,</hi> in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Applauded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Author is a Young Gentleman who, tho' ſevere Accidents, and the
Rigour of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune have thrown him into the Condition of an <hi>Orphan,</hi> is
ſtill likely to prove a <hi>Fav'rite Son</hi> of the <hi>Muſes:</hi> But a
Genius, tho' never ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, will not readily make its Way into 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0199100801:123"/> Eſteem, without the Aid of a Recommender, or the
Encouragement of a Patron.</p>
            <p>HERE I read over the <hi>Verſes,</hi> and ſignified my
Approbation, in very few Words, becauſe I perceived the generous <hi>Temper</hi> of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> inclin'd him to ſpeak further, in
behalf of <hi>Unfortunate Deſert</hi>; when, reſuming the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
he proceeded in this Manner.</p>
            <p>YOU may gueſs by this little Performance, That thoſe Talents,
which were not happy enough to procure their Poſſeſſor a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
from <hi>Parents</hi> who liv'd in Affluence, may, if Cultivated and Improved,
intitle him to the <hi>Adoption</hi> of ſome great <hi>Perſonage,</hi> who,
obſerving a <hi>Noble Impartiality,</hi> with Regard to <hi>Strangers</hi>
and <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> may aſſiſt <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> whereſoever he
finds it. It would really be pity that a Perſon, who has demonſtrated, that
he has a <hi>Capacity</hi> to entertain the <hi>World,</hi> ſhould not meet
with a <hi>Patron</hi> in it, to give him a <hi>Taſte</hi> of its <hi>Enjoyments.</hi> Whoever may be meant by <hi>HORATIUS,</hi> if he makes as
Handſome a <hi>Figure</hi> in his Reception of the <hi>Poet,</hi> as he does
in the <hi>Poet</hi>'s <hi>Deſcription,</hi> he will be to him inſtead of a <hi>Mecoenas</hi>; and you will have the Satisfaction of knowing, That you put
the <hi>Meritorious</hi> in a Way to meet <hi>Reward,</hi> and adminiſter an <hi>Opportunity,</hi> the moſt Grateful (that can be) to a Perſon truly <hi>Great,</hi> an <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> of doing a Graceful <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE a Gentleman interrupted us, and left me no <hi>Room</hi> to make <hi>Reply</hi> by Word of Mouth: But the beſt <hi>Anſwer</hi> I could,
ſince, make him, <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0199100801:124"/> was to repeat, in this manner, what

            <p>THERE is a <hi>Scantineſs,</hi> in ſome Mens Souls, that gives a
diſtaſteful Air to their very Favours, and their Praiſes; what the <hi>Mien</hi> is to the Body, the <hi>Temper</hi> is to the Mind. And for Want
of this Obſervation, on Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons where it had been moſt uſeful,
ſome have loſt their Friends Good-will by an arrogant Manner of <hi>obliging</hi> them; and others <hi>prais'd</hi> Men into a <hi>Contempt</hi> both for their Perſons and their Civilities.</p>
            <p>THERE muſt be viſible, in thoſe, who wou'd ſay, or do, Things
engagingly, a certain Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Eye, and a Senſe of Pleaſure in
the Deportment. A Compliment is an <hi>Affront,</hi> when accompany'd with a
ſullen Brow, or a negligent, an abſent, or ſupercilious, Behaviour. I
appeal to my Readers, Whether they do not <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0199100801:127"/> always find
themſelves uneaſy in the Company of a Perſon, who ſeems more pleas'd
with <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> than with thoſe he is converſing with.</p>
            <p>I WAS drawn into this Reflection, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other Day, a little
Copy of VERSES, which is printed, with ſome Poetical Pieces of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s, and was written by a Perſon of very great Quality, and

            <p>THE good Nature of Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> muſt be as Extenſive, as his
Wit, if his Eſteem for this <hi>Noble</hi> Author was not leſſen'd, by
ſo <hi>Ignoble</hi> a Start of his Poetry. It is a grudging, haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
conſcious, reluctant, and penurious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium! Under Pretence of Praiſe to
a Friend, it indulges Spleen to his Enemies. It carries, throughout, a cloſer
Eye upon <hi>his own</hi> Merit, than upon <hi>His</hi> to whom he
addreſſes it. In four and twenty Verſes, the four odd ones, I <hi>think,</hi> have ſome faint Inclination to ſhew Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>another</hi>; but the twenty, <hi>I am ſure,</hi> with a much ſtronger
Bent, point directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WOULD this great Man have applauded ſuch a POET, as he ought, he
ſhou'd have forgotten, or ſeem'd to forget, both <hi>Himſelf,</hi> and
his <hi>Rank,</hi> in that Reverence, ſo juſtly due to an Excellence, which
will do Honour to our Nation. He ſhou'd not have imagin'd himſelf over
Bountiful in his Condeſcention: The Praiſe of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> will be a
Theme for Wit, and Learning, when all the <hi>Dukes,</hi> his <hi>Patrons,</hi>
ſhall be <hi>loſt</hi> in the Duſt that covers them! The accidental
Advantages of Birth, Wealth, and Title, are ſo far from beſtowing Worth,
where they find it not originally, that they ſerve but to make the Want of it
more <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0199100801:129"/> obvious and contemptible; whereas a <hi>Genius</hi>
like this Gentleman's, ſurmounts all the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy Superiorities of Fortune,
adorns Dignity itſelf, and makes Obſcurity illuſtrious!</p>
            <p>THE great <hi>Cardinal Richelieu,</hi> in a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of like

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THO' I have often, and openly, declar'd what I think of your
Writings, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not I ſatisfy my ſelf without ſending you, by this
Letter, a more <hi>Authentic</hi> Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I never had any particular
Affection for your Perſon, and ſince, therefore, it is the Prerogative of <hi>Truth,</hi> that compels me to my Opinion, I will take care, That the
Eſteem, I profeſs for your Works, ſhall be no <hi>barren Compliment</hi>;
for my Praiſe ſhall be ſeconded by the <hi>Applauſe</hi> of a whole <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, if, notwithſtanding my Endeavours, ſome low Spirits ſhall
be found, who may affect to think otherwiſe, Time will make them but too
ſenſible, that the Faults, they <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0199100801:130"/> impute to <hi>You,</hi> are Defects in their own Judgment. They are like People in the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> who ſee every Thing of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper'd Colour, which
themſelves are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by.</p>
                  <p>IN the Days of our Anceſtors, Perſons of narrow Underſtanding
were implicite Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of what was above their Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but now, by
a kind of <hi>Elaſticity</hi> in modern Reaſon, Judgment <hi>extends</hi>
or <hi>contracts</hi> itſelf, to ſit cloſe upon our <hi>Capacity</hi>;
and we approve, but juſt as far, as we are able to underſtand; blaſting
every Thing by our Cenſure, that we cannot reach by our Practice. Yet I hope,
I do not preſume too much, when I ſay concerning your Works, That <hi>I
ſee Things as they are,</hi> and <hi>declare 'em</hi> what I <hi>ſee</hi>
them. Your Conceptions are ſtrong, and the Flight of your Imagination
outſoars every Thing but your Reaſon: Your Language is pure, and your
Expreſſion ſtrongly Elegant.</p>
                  <p>I WILL conclude with this Caution; That you will be guilty in the
Eye of God, if you ſuffer ſuch a Pen to <hi>reſt</hi>; or if you <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy</hi> it too <hi>idly.</hi> You ought to apply your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
henceforward, to grave and important Subjects; and I am content that you
ſhall impute to <hi>Me,</hi> all the <hi>Blame,</hi> if, when you do ſo,
you receive not the Returns, which will be due to you. Already I am medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an Opportunity to be known for</p>

               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0199100801:131"/>I AM tranſported, while I read this Letter, at
the flaming Intermixture of this Stateſman's lovely Qualities! What a Glow of
Humanity! What a Conſciouſneſs of that Care, which is the Duty of the <hi>Great,</hi> to draw up Merit, out of Obſcurity! What a Knowledge of a
State's true Intereſt, from the Force of ſuch Examples! What a genteel <hi>Magnanimity!</hi> What a ſpirited Race of Sweetneſs, does there
ſhine, in this ſhort Letter!</p>
            <p>IT is pleaſant enough to remark, That both the <hi>French</hi>
Encomium and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had Effects, the very Reverſe of what
was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Authors; yet, at the ſame Time, ſtrictly conſonant
with <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Merits; while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Applauder ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> the Praiſe
he <hi>means</hi> to <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>; his Verſes are never read without
leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Character; whereas, the generous <hi>French
Cardinal,</hi> meaning nothing in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the Encouragement of <hi>Monſieur Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zac,</hi> draws that Honour on his own Name, which he wou'd
beſtow upon another's; and becomes <hi>Himſelf,</hi> the <hi>Reader's
Idol,</hi> while he is pointing him where to worſhip!</p>
            <p>IT was impoſſible for <hi>Monſieur Balzac,</hi> after being thus
nobly diſtinguiſh'd, not to ſtrain his Genius to the utmoſt, to keep
Poſſeſſion of a Glory, he muſt ſo juſtly have been Proud of;
whereas <hi>Neglect,</hi> on the other Hand, has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd a thouſand
Spirits, which might have been capable, had they been <hi>Fortunate,</hi> or
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by thoſe who were ſo, to ſhine out <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0199100801:132"/> as <hi>living Lights,</hi> and illuſtrate the Age, they were born in, thro' a
long Courſe of Futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Camoens,</hi> whom the <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
call the <hi>Virgil</hi> of <hi>their</hi> Country, has touch'd this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
very happily, in the 5th Book of his <hi>Luſiad.</hi>

            <p>MY Old Maid, who has liv'd with me theſe thirty Years, and claims
the <hi>tuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me up,</hi> as a Privilege annex'd to her <hi>Office</hi>;
left open my Window-curtains laſt Night, <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0199100801:134"/> which ſo
early let in the Beams of the Sun upon me, that I was wak'd from a Dream, which
I cou'd have wiſh'd to enjoy much longer.</p>
            <p>FANCY had remov'd all my Diſtance from Youth; and given me back
thoſe gentle Flames, which warm and brighten Life in its <hi>Morning.</hi> I
ſaw an adorable Object, which my Soul, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, had once been
paſſionately fond of: And of whoſe Perfections I imagin'd myſelf to
have been vertuouſly enamour'd: But I had loſt her, as I fancy'd, in <hi>Death.</hi> Oh! the Pain of that Imagination was terrible even in Sleep! I
ſaw this lovely Perſon, adorn'd with all her Sweetneſs! I heard the
Muſick of her Accents, informing me, ſhe was <hi>my PATTY.</hi> Now grown
kinder and more ſenſible, I even <hi>felt</hi> her leaning over me; and
found the animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Influence of her Soul-enchanting Preſſures! With what
Ecſtaſy of Fondneſs did I ſurvey her lovely Languor! Her Eyes were
melting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relax'd; and their Beams ſerenely temper'd with angelick
Softneſs and Compaſſion. Her very <hi>Soul</hi> ſeem'd to ſhine upon
me, through the Smile of every Feature. Oh! how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful is a chaſt
Paſſion! How ſweetly does it remain upon the Mind, and appeal from <hi>Death</hi> to the <hi>Memory!</hi> I never knew, till this dear Dream
convinc'd me, what I loſt by not lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while my <hi>Body,</hi> as well as
my <hi>Soul,</hi> cou'd have done Juſtice to the Paſſion.</p>
            <p>WHILE I was thus tenderly employ'd, I wiſh ſome Artiſt cou'd
have ſnatch'd my Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! Old as I am, I flatter myſelf, That Love 
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0199100801:135"/> wou'd have lent it Luſtre. I wou'd have all my
Friends, who <hi>are not,</hi> reſolve immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to commence <hi>Lovers.</hi> The Inſipids, who have never <hi>lov'd,</hi> may be ſaid
to live as the Greedy <hi>drink</hi>; they <hi>ſwallow</hi> Life without <hi>taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it.</p>
            <p>BUT, all tranſported as I was, with this charming Dream, it was
raviſh'd from me, by the Sun. Yet did I not <hi>complain.</hi> It had tun'd
my Soul to Harmony; and transform'd me from an Old <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> into
a young and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Wanton!</hi> I ſtarted from my Bed, and flew with
Vigour to the Glaſs! to which I have long accuſtom'd myſelf to creep
without Tranſport. Old and Worm-eaten as it is in every Part of its broad
Frame, yet did it not alarm me. I even ſaw my own Face in it without the
leaſt Mortification. Nay, I took Notice, That my Night-cap was not ſo White
as it ought to have been; which in more unpolite Hours, I ſhou'd have thought
not worth remarking. But <hi>Love</hi> adorns and improves us! My Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
ſwell'd with Sighs, and my Eyes ſhone with Pleaſure. I bruſh'd up my <hi>Mouſe-colour</hi> Gloves, and was wiſhing they had been <hi>Yellow
ones.</hi> I powder'd my ſhort Hair; and comb'd it down to look longer. Nay I
almoſt arriv'd at the Foppery of ſpoiling my new <hi>Beaver,</hi> by
inflicting the modern <hi>Pinch</hi> on it. At length I remember'd, That my
Youth was but a <hi>Dream!</hi> And my <hi>PATTY</hi> a <hi>COQUET!</hi> My
Arms, at this Thought, folded ſadly upon my Breaſt; I ſunk into my eaſy
Chair, and was, ſome <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0199100801:136"/> Minutes, quite <hi>loſt</hi>
there, before I cou'd recover myſelf. How dreadful is the Deſcent, from
airy Pleaſure to ſubſtantial Miſery! It is not to be deſcrib'd in
Proſe, and ſince <hi>LOVE</hi> both deſerves good Poetry, and can
inſpire it, let me ſee what my <hi>Muſe</hi> will ſay to it.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>Oh! Lovely Object! Whoſe dear Form I keep,</l> 
               <l>In buſy Daylight and in ſilent Sleep!</l> 
               <l>Reviſit Fancy—to my Sighs attend;</l> 
               <l>Thou <hi>imag'd Shadow</hi> of my Soul's ſoft Friend!</l> 
               <l>When I recall thy Beauties to my Mind,</l> 
               <l>How <hi>dead</hi> are all Things thou haſt left behind!</l> 
               <l>Study, Pride, Friendſhip, languiſh for thy Sake;</l> 
               <l>Oh! Why did <hi>Love</hi> from thy ſweet Tomb awake?</l> 
               <l>Why <hi>move</hi> his pointed Arrows in my Breaſt,</l> 
               <l>In Life's Deſcent, and the cool <hi>Vale</hi> of <hi>Reſt!</hi>
               </l> 
               <l>Oh! charm not thus my <hi>Soul,</hi> which is deſign'd</l> 
               <l>To <hi>flow</hi> down <hi>Time,</hi> and ſtrengthen Humankind!</l>
            </q>
            <p>WELL! My Readers ſhou'd think as I do, that all Things are for the <hi>Beſt.</hi> I loſt my Dream, and they find a Poet. The Witlings will
ſay, a <hi>dreaming</hi> one! But Melancholy has its Charms, and I am <hi>ſweetly Sad,</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it.</p>
            <p>WHILE I was indulging this mournful Tenderneſs, I heard a gentle Rap
at my Door, as if it fear'd to alarm me; and the Outſide of it ſeem'd to be
ſwept by the ruſtling of Silk; a Muſick I am not us'd to! I open'd it
ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for I was ſtill loſt to myſelf; and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd by a <hi>Lady</hi> in a modeſt but moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0199100801:137"/>
Manner. She appear'd to be near thirty; and was dreſs'd, very gravely, a
little remov'd from the preſent <hi>Mode.</hi> But my Heart ſprung within
me! For all the Beauties of my Viſion were more than verify'd in this <hi>Reality!</hi> The Soul of a <hi>God</hi> ſeem'd to ſtream through her
Eyes! And the Ideas of her Wit and Majeſtick Underſtanding <hi>flam'd</hi>
and <hi>ſparkled</hi> in her <hi>meaning Softneſs!</hi> There was
ſomething in her Air, that made the Room ſeem to <hi>blaze</hi> round her!
I led her to my great Chair, but ſhe gracefully declin'd it, and ſeated
herſelf at ſome Diſtance, not to ſhew the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſhe had, to my <hi>Age,</hi> I hope, but my <hi>Writings:</hi> After a Preface, of the
ſweeteſt Praiſe, that Vanity cou'd wiſh to hear, ſhe took a Paper
from her Boſom; and ſeem'd to tremble, while ſhe gave it me, as if it
enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe'd ſome Declaration, that her <hi>Heart</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in. How
becoming is <hi>Humility,</hi> when ſuch Excellence condeſcends to wear
it!—She withdrew: and, from her <hi>Manner,</hi> I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Paper with
Impatience; and found in it what follows.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I WAIT on you, with my own Letter, from the Reſpectful Deſire I
have to ſee the Perſon of him, whoſe Soul I ſo much admire, in the
PLAIN DEALER. I knew very well, That the Reverence you muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, wou'd
prevent my ſpeaking freely, and <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0199100801:138"/> I choſe therefore,
to <hi>write,</hi> what I wiſhed to inform you of.</p>
                  <p>I WAS the other Day, in an Aſſembly, of what the World calls <hi>fine Ladies</hi>; to which gay Part of our Species I have lately been a
Stranger, ſo that I found their Dreſs, and their Converſation entirely
Foreign to me; though, (through all Diſguiſes) I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>Britiſh Beauty!</hi>—The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of their Fans, and the
Loudneſs of their Laughter, alarm'd, and oppreſs'd my Ear; as the new
Situation of their Elbows drew my Eye under Aſtoniſhment! One of the
Ladies, who, I fear for her own ſake, is what they call a <hi>Toaſt,</hi>
was, moſt lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, delighted with a young Gentleman, who ſat next her,
and who by the Oddneſs of his Dreſs, ſurpriz'd me, more than the Ladies
did.—His Wig, inſtead of gracefully adorning his Shoulders, was tuck'd
up into a Bag, of the ſame <hi>Content</hi> with his Head; and had two Wings
ſhooting from it; ſo that he look'd like a <hi>Mercury revers'd.</hi> The
lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Hair, that eſcap'd this Bag, (becauſe no Hat was allowed to
ſhield it) was cemented by Oil and Powder; to ſecure it againſt
Tempeſt. The Sleeve of his Coat had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd the Middle of his Arm, from the
Place I ſhould have look'd for it in, and <hi>preferr'd</hi> the Bend of his
Elbow, to within three Inches of his Shoulder. His Stockings were ſo high
embroider'd, that they left no Shape to his <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0199100801:139"/> Leg: And his
Hands, to his Fingers Ends, were <hi>entomb'd,</hi> in a Pair of Ruffles. He
was button'd up to the Chin, in a white Dimmity Waiſtcoat; and wore a Frock,
which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he borrow'd from one of his Grooms, to emulate the <hi>Jockey Air</hi> with the more Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and Propriety.</p>
                  <p>AS odd a Creature as this was, he ſeem'd to conſider <hi>Me</hi>
as an <hi>Odder</hi>; for I over-heard him whiſper his fair Neighbour, That,
by my Ill Dreſs, and my Neglect of the Company, I muſt be either a <hi>Wit,</hi> or a <hi>Tory!</hi> It was plain, he ſaid, from my Behaviour,
that I was unlearned in the new World, and he fancied, for his Part, that I
dropt out of the <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> laſt <hi>Monday</hi>!—The
Favourite Lady oblig'd him with a tender Look; and burſt into a loud
Laughter. I found that all his Diſcourſe was fill'd with Arrogance, and
Folly; and a Monſter bred of both, which they call <hi>Double Entendres.</hi>
At laſt, he hum'd half a Tune; danc'd a Step or two, to his own Muſick;
took <hi>Snuff</hi> and <hi>Leave</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and <hi>hopt</hi> out of the
Company.</p>
                  <p>The Ladies were now at Leiſure to look a little at me. But their
Hearts ſeem'd ſtrangely full of this ridiculous Object, whom they
immediately fell a praiſing, with a kind of miſerable Emulation. Mr. <hi>Fluſhcheek,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Toaſt,</hi> is, ſure! the moſt
delightful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! the fineſt, and beſt-bred Gentleman! how witty! how
tender! how polite and <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0199100801:140"/> how <hi>ſevere,</hi> he is! He
is the Soul of Senſe, and Gallantry; and the very Life of the <hi>Maſquerade:</hi> I ſtarted, at their Admiration; and felt my Heart
ſink into Pity for 'em; while I contemplated, in Silence, the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
my adorable <hi>Bellario.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>OH! Mr. PLAIN DEALER! that I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Language to convey him to
your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination! You wou'd then approve my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And I ſhou'd be
juſtify'd even to your <hi>Reaſon.</hi> His Perſon is divinely form'd,
Tall and Graceful! His Eyes, which are full of Wiſdom, wear a <hi>Gentleneſs,</hi> as if they griev'd their own Luſtre, and were willing
to <hi>decline</hi> themſelves in Pity to the Beholders! His Lips are rarely
open'd but to <hi>praiſe</hi> or to <hi>improve,</hi> though he has Teeth,
which he might be proud of ſhewing. There is, in the Turn of his Arms, an
inexpreſſible Air of Majeſty! I never look on him without <hi>ſeeing</hi> all the great Men, I have read of. I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before him,
with a kind of <hi>religious Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion!</hi> For Religion and Virtue are
adorn'd by his Converſation! So that I may ſay, without Falſhood, that it
is <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> him! His Dreſs is diſengag'd; and he <hi>knows</hi> all Things but, that he is charming! Oh! that you were
acquainted with his Mind, which is ſhining with every Virtue! Amidſt the
Throng of his Beauties, I forgot to tell you, That he is a <hi>Poet,</hi> a
moſt <hi>Divine</hi> one! Believe me it is no <hi>Fiction!</hi> Place him
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0199100801:141"/> before Mr. <hi>Fluſhcheek</hi>'s Eyes; and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his fair Admirers: for they take in the PLAIN DEALER.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I FELL aſleep, the other Night, after medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, in my Bed, on our
general Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, at the Fortune that is alloted us; and had,
again, an extraordinary Dream, but <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0199100801:142"/> very different from
my laſt; and ſo ſtrongly diſtinct, and entertaining, that I flatter
myſelf, my <hi>Readers</hi> will be glad to ſhare its Impreſſion, while
it is new, upon my Memory.</p>
            <p>I WAS plac'd, I knew not how, on the Top of a green Hill; which was
very flow'ry, and fragrant. The World, methought, lay under it, in a vaſt
Deſcent of Cloudineſs! A thouſand Roads led up to it; but, with ſuch
intricate, and mazy Windings, that my Eye was unable to trace any of them,
diſtinctly: Yet they, all, open'd at laſt, upon the Summit of the Hill, and
pour'd out a mix'd Multitude, of both Sexes, and of all Ages, and Conditions;
who, as ſoon as they had reach'd the Flat, haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward towards its
Center.</p>
            <p>I WAS wonderfully pleas'd, to diſcover <hi>Patty Amble,</hi> in the
Crowd; and, giving her my Hand, led her on, with great Compoſure. She
inform'd me, That the Place we were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the <hi>Mount of Fortune</hi>;
and, That ſhe was going to a <hi>Fair,</hi> which is held on it, and call'd, <hi>Mend-all Market.</hi> Her Buſineſs, ſhe ſaid, was to change her
Condition, for a Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and, ſhe doubted not, but I might do the ſame, if
I pleas'd, ſince I had found my Way, up the Hill. For all People, who came
thither, were allow'd the happy Privilege, to lay down their own Burdens; and
take up lighter, in the Room of them.</p>
            <p>IN the very middle of the Plain, we came, at length, to a kind of <hi>May-Pole,</hi> which was bigger than the <hi>Monument</hi>; and as high as
the <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0199100801:143"/> 
               <hi>Pike</hi> of <hi>Teneriff:</hi> It was of a
bright <hi>Yellow,</hi> or <hi>Gold-colour</hi>; but twinkled, ſtrangely, at
a Diſtance; and looked dazling, and tranſparent. There hung, off from it,
all about, lovely Garlands, of precious Stones, with a Mixture of the
ſweeteſt Flowers; the <hi>Hues</hi> of which were <hi>changeable,</hi> and
varied every Moment, with a moſt bewitching Delightfulneſs. Upon the
Pinacle of this Pyramid, ſat the Goddeſs of the Place, very buſily
ſpinning: But the Thread ſhe twiſted off, was too <hi>fine,</hi> to be
ſeen, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Us, who ſtood, ſo far, below it. The Wheel, in
its Motion, made a muſical Sound; but ſo rough, and ſo loud, that it
ſhook the Hill, all round it. It ſcatter'd, while ſhe turn'd it, a
ſparkling Shower of <hi>Globules,</hi> that were many-colour'd, but hollow;
and broke, like empty Bubbles, in their deſcending over the Multitude.</p>
            <p>WHAT I obſerv'd, with moſt Concern, was, that, the nearer we came,
the Proſpect grew leſs charming; for the Duſt was ſo thick, that our
Eyes, and Mouths, were filled with it; and our Heads ak'd with the Buſtle,
and the Noiſe, of the Tumult. The Commodities, which were to be barter'd for,
lay, ſpread, every where, in Heaps; and All, who paſs'd between, were
invited to come, and cheapen them.—<hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, Limonades,</hi> and
Variety of the fineſt <hi>Fruits,</hi> were offer'd, diligently, up and down,
by little <hi>Cupids,</hi> with painted Baskets: And Trumpeters, Jugglers,
Rope-dancers, <hi>Merry-Andrews,</hi> and <hi>Opera-Mongers,</hi> were exerting
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0199100801:144"/> themſelves, on all Sides, to compleat the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar of
the Market. But, tho' I paſs'd by all their <hi>Stages,</hi> I ſaw no more
than <hi>Two,</hi> whoſe Faces were well known to me; and Thoſe were, <hi>Heidegger,</hi> and <hi>Doctor Fauſtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Front of every Pile, roſe an <hi>Alabaſter Pillar,</hi>
whereon hung a Picture, fill'd with Figures, all in <hi>Motion</hi>;
repreſenting whatever was moſt tempting, and deſirable, in the
Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize it recommended. And, at the Foot of each Pillar, was placed an <hi>Ebony Chair</hi>; on both Sides of which, ſtood young, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Women, dreſs'd like <hi>Muſes</hi> and <hi>Graces:</hi> Some inviting
Paſſengers to take Poſſeſſion of the Empty Seat; and others
pointing up, to a Compartment, on the Top of it, where was to be read, in
golden Letters, the Name, and Quality, of the Merchandize.</p>
            <p>WE made up, to a Heap, that was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably higher than the Reſt;
and read, there, the Word <hi>ROYALTY.</hi> We were agreeably ſurpriz'd, to
ſee, moving, in the Picture, that hung upon this Pillar, <hi>Armies,
Palaces,</hi> and <hi>Navies!</hi> Crowds of Men, upon their Knees; and Women,
ſtill more proſtrate!—Banquets, Treaſures, Sports, and Triumphs,
all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in their Turns, drew a mighty Crowd of Gazers; who were
ſtruggling for the Chair, and puſh'd each other from it. <hi>Patty
Amble</hi> was very earneſt, to have had <hi>me</hi> put in for it: But I
wink'd upon her, to be quiet; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, we ſaw a Perſon, breaking
ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the Crowd; who, with loud <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0199100801:145"/> 
               <hi>Huzza</hi>'s, and Concurrence, plac'd him, there, and bow'd round
him.—But, no ſooner was he ſeated, when the tempting Figures, in the
Picture, chang'd, immediately, into <hi>horrible</hi> Ones!—Cares,
Dangers, Hatred, Reſtleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a thouſand <hi>ſooty Furies,</hi>
roll'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietly, about him! The <hi>Muſes,</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> were
transform'd into <hi>Serpents,</hi> and <hi>Satyrs!</hi> that hiſs'd,
grinn'd, and pointed at him. And, when he wou'd have, gladly, eſcap'd, and
ſprung out of the Chair, he found himſelf held down in it, by a Troop of <hi>meagre Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> that frighted us away, from any further
Obſervation of him.</p>
            <p>THE next Place, that we ſtopp'd at, was the Column of BEAUTY. We
look'd up, to the Picture, and ſaw, moving, in it, a mix'd, and confus'd
Buſtle, of Coaches, Footmen, and Coronets: Men, with their Hearts in their
Hands; and an indiſtinct Cavalcade, of ſhape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Things, without Heads,
call'd Smiles, Sighs, Vows, Deſires, Faintings, Languiſhments, and
Adorations. There came, up, to this Place, in great Hurry, a fat, but
ſprightly, Young Woman, with a Bundle, under her Arm; which ſhe laid down,
by Way of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and which, we obſerv'd, as ſhe ſorted the Goods, to be
fill'd with large Legs, red Hair, brown Skin, big Breaſts; and
Small-Pox-Marks, in abundance. The Attendants, at the Pillar, having agreed to
the Exchange, were inviting her into the <hi>Ebony</hi> Chair; when I, who, by
this Time, began to ſuſpect their fair Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0199100801:146"/> 
               <hi>turn'd</hi> the Picture, with my <hi>Stick:</hi> and expos'd its other Side
to the <hi>She-Merchant</hi>; which was to be Part of her Bargain, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of Scandal, Spleen, Jealouſy, Anguiſh, Perjury, and Ruin.
She no ſooner ſaw the Faces of this ugly Neſt of Monſters, but,
ſnatching up her own Bundle, ſhe ran, as faſt as her thick Legs cou'd
carry her; tumbling, Head over Heels, at every Heap in her Way; and getting up,
as ſhe beſt cou'd; without ſtaying, to look behind her.</p>
            <p>WHILE we were diverting ourſelves, at this pleaſant Flight, a
Perſon, whom Nature had deſign'd, and limb'd, for a <hi>PLOWMAN,</hi> had
been ſeiz'd with an Ambition to be made a <hi>Miniſter of State</hi>; and,
having thrown down his Burden, of Toil, Penury, and Dirtineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
Pillar of POWER, had ſeated himſelf, triumphantly, in the Chair, at the
Foot of it; but was frighted out of his Wits, by that time we came up to him;
for we found him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſmother'd, under an unmerciful Load of Slanders,
Terrors, Axes, and Halters; which he had much ado to crawl out from; and was
bawling, with great Earneſtneſs, and Diſtortion of Muſcles, to have his <hi>Own Goods</hi> reſtor'd him.</p>
            <p>IN the next Compartment we examin'd, we found written the Word,
TITLES. We ſaw, there, a Beau, with ſix Footmen behind him, very
earneſtly peruſing the moving Trophies, in the Picture. My <hi>Coquet</hi>
felt her Heart beat, at the Sight of ſo fine a Gentleman; and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0199100801:147"/> her Opinion, That I need not turn <hi>that</hi> Picture;
for ſure! there was no <hi>Ill</hi> to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, <hi>there</hi>;—I did it, however, and the Beau fell into Fits; at the
ſudden ruſhing out of a Whirlwind of Ignorance, Conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Scorn,
Luxury, and Diſeaſes!</p>
            <p>I frighted an honeſt Citizen, in much the ſame Manner, from the
Standard of WEALTH. He had taken a Fancy for Preferment: and was wiſhing,
extremely, to be erected into an <hi>Alderman!</hi>—He had counted out,
for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, a Life-full of Eaſe; a ſmall Parcel of
Underſtanding; and <hi>Ditto,</hi> of Conſcience. But, the very Minute I
turn'd the Picture, there flew, into his Face, Dullneſs, Cuckoldom, and
Clumſineſs! upon which he took to his Heels, and left his <hi>own Bag</hi>
behind him.</p>
            <p>AT the Column of WIT, I was agreeably entertain'd, among a large
Circle of <hi>Gapers,</hi> who were admiring the wonderful <hi>Mechaniſm</hi>
of the Picture, that was hung upon that Pillar.—Cities, Mountains,
Oceans, Woods, Skies, Meadows, Gardens, Gods, and Goddeſſes, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
Mermaids, Cupids, Dragons, Miſtreſſes, Witches, Enchanted Caſtles,
Fields of Air; and Seas of Fire; all, delightfully, intermix'd, and confounded,
roſe, and charm'd the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation!—But the Crowd diſpers'd,
immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, on my diſcovering, to their great Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and Amazement, that
there lurk'd, behind all this Gaiety, a <hi>lean</hi> Society, call'd Envy,
Malice, Poverty, Dependence, and Calamity!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0199100801:148"/>I WALK'D quite through the <hi>Fair</hi>; and,
where-ever I wander'd, perceived it was, in all Parts, alike. They, who brought <hi>Complaints,</hi> to exchange, againſt <hi>Good-Fortune,</hi> choſe to
carry their <hi>own</hi> back again, rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a <hi>New</hi>
Bargain. There was ſomething, in every Heap, that they were inclinable enough
to purchaſe;—But there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too, that muſt go with it,
which they could not bear to be troubled with: ſo, they went murmuring, away;
and beſtow'd their Curſes, in great Plenty, on the Goddeſs, who kept the
Market; which was never the thinner, notwithſtanding; for, ſtill, new
Crowds ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Places of thoſe, who return'd, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfy'd. Nor
cou'd the Warnings they met with, from ſuch Numbers who had been
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, prevail with theſe new Comers, to believe, they ſhou'd go
back again, without being the Richer, from a <hi>Mart,</hi> that was ſtor'd,
ſo plentifully, with all, that the World calls Valuable.</p>
            <p>AMONG the infinite Variety of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which glitter'd, every
where, about me, I was in Danger but once; and That was, at the Pillar of FAME.
I ſaw, when I turn'd that Picture, that the Weight of the Counter-balance
lay, chiefly, in theſe four Evils,—<hi>Death, Time, Detraction,</hi>
and <hi>Uncertainty!</hi> Yet, ſo ſtrong was my Deſire to float my Name
through Futurity, that I was reſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to take
Poſſeſſion of the Chair.—But, having Nothing of Value about me,
but my <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0199100801:149"/> 
               <hi>Oaken Stick,</hi> and <hi>Mouſe-colour'd
Gloves,</hi> (the firſt of which they refus'd, becauſe of the Miſchief it
had done 'em, in turning up the wrong Sides of their Pictures; and the Second,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not <hi>fine</hi> enough to be faſhionable, in that Region,) I was
forc'd upon an Expedient, which I am almoſt afraid to confeſs, for fear of
loſing, for ever, the Good Opinion of my Female Readers.</p>
            <p>TO ſay all, in a Word, I was, heroically, reſolv'd, to give up my <hi>Love</hi> for my <hi>Glory</hi>; ſo, taking <hi>Patty Amble</hi> by the
Hand, I prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd <hi>Her,</hi> in Barter, (having no <hi>Other
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.</hi>) The Attendants, who watch'd the Pillar, were juſt ready to
take hold of her; when ſhe threw her Arms about my Neck, and <hi>conjur'd</hi> me, by all the Tyes, of Honour, and of Gallantry, that I
wou'd not leave her, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to ſo empty a Divinity, as the Regent of
that Mountain! She begg'd, that I wou'd return, with her, to the Lower, but
happier World: and, whatever I ſhould ask of her, ſhe wou'd grant me, by
Way of Recompence. I took her ſuddenly, at her Word, and ask'd her <hi>Heart</hi> for a <hi>Fairing.</hi>—Nay, ſpare me but that One
Thing, ſaid ſhe, with a languiſhing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfulneſs, and take <hi>any
thing elſe, about me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately overjoy'd, at this Bliſs, which, methought, befel me,
the ſudden Flow of my Spirits, under a Senſe of the promis'd Tranſport,
caus'd ſo violent an Agitation, that, waking on a ſudden, I dropt, out of
her Arms, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd myſelf in my Bed, in <hi>Barbican.</hi>

            <p>I PASS ſome agreeable Hours, now and then, at the Houſe of <hi>Sir

of Town; and having got his Eſtate, by a long and buſy Life, ſpent in

its Hurry; and enjoys it with a graceful Eaſe, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
Hoſpitality. The only Inconvenience, I have to complain of, when I am with
him, is, that the Company I meet there, is not ſo Delicate as I cou'd wiſh
it; but mix'd with that Ineligance, which muſt be expected, and ſubmitted
to, among Men of Buſineſs: whoſe Friendſhips are form'd, for the moſt

            <p>ONE of the moſt conſtant Gueſts, at <hi>Sir Portly</hi>'s, is <hi>Tony Gingle</hi> his Siſter's Son; who has a great Genius for Poetry. He
makes very good Verſes, and pronounces, gracefully enough, thoſe he
repeats, from other Writers,—ſo far, all is well. But the worſt of it
is, that <hi>Tony</hi> has ſtudied nothing, <hi>but</hi> Poetry. He is quite
dark in the uſeful Doctrine of Times, Seaſons, and Places. It is the ſame
Thing to <hi>him,</hi> when the Muſe <hi>bites,</hi> whether he quotes
Tragedy, to a Man of Letters, his Taylor's Wife, or a Stockjobber. The Chimes
of his Numbers are for ever, ringing in his Fancy: And all, who chance to ſit
near him, muſt have their Share of the Melody. He has taken it into his Head,
that, becauſe <hi>he</hi> can make a conſiderable Figure, <hi>as a
Poet,</hi> there is nothing, conſiderable, <hi>but Poetry!</hi> And it is a
very pleaſant Scene to obſerve <hi>Tony,</hi> ſtudying, at one of the
Tables of a full Coffee-Houſe, in the midſt of the City; ſcanning
Verſes, on his Fingers: Conceiving, writing, and blotting out: And humming
them over, to himſelf, <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0199100801:152"/> with all the Rapture, and
Geſticulation, of <hi>Tone, Action,</hi> and <hi>Paſſion!</hi>
Regardleſs that he is ſtar'd at, and remark'd, all the while, by a dozen or
two of thriving Citizens; who ſhake their Heads and <hi>pity</hi> him, as a
Man, that has <hi>loſt</hi> his <hi>Wits</hi>; even while he is under the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of being <hi>Witty!</hi>—He has never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his
Brain to grow cool enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, That <hi>Wit,</hi> in dull Company, is
the dulleſt Subject in the World; and that it is a Folly, to talk of <hi>Homer, Horace,</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi> among Grave Fellows within <hi>Ludgate</hi>; who, when they hear of a Great Poet, will tell you a Story of <hi>Tom Brown</hi>; and feel no Difference in the Power of <hi>Tony
Gingle</hi>'s own Works, and the humble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of their <hi>Bellman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jack Juniper,</hi> the Apothecary; and <hi>Tom Tireſome,</hi>
the Haberdaſher, living both in the ſame Street, ride down together, twice
a Week, to take a Bottle, with my Friend, <hi>Sir Portly.</hi>—<hi>Jack
Juniper</hi> reads us Lectures, on the new Improvements in <hi>Botany,</hi> and
the Riſe, and Progreſs of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> which are, accurately,
anſwer'd, by Mr. <hi>Thomas Tireſome</hi>; with the Price of the <hi>Stocks</hi>; and the Mournful Decay of the <hi>Spittle-fields
Weaving.</hi>—As ſoon as this very able Apothecary has open'd, and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd to us, the <hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> the punctual
Haberdaſher repays his Kindneſs, with the <hi>Courſe of Exchange.</hi> If
ſome <hi>Patient,</hi> of the One, has taken <hi>Phyſick,</hi> for her <hi>Complexion</hi>; ſome Lady, who is the Other's Cuſtomer, has, with
equal Advantage to her Skin, fallen into <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0199100801:153"/> the Wear of his
new <hi>Bluſh-Colour.</hi>—But, in the very Heighth of their <hi>Elucidations, Tony Gingle</hi> never fails to <hi>wedge in,</hi> between
'em both, ſome ſix Dozen of Quotations, from a Poem, call'd the <hi>Diſpenſary</hi>; though the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Mr. <hi>Juniper</hi> is
continually interrupting him with the <hi>true Hiſtory</hi> of every weighty
Occurrence, in <hi>Apothecaries-Hall,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd the Muſe of the
merry <hi>Doctor.</hi> While poor <hi>Tom Tireſome,</hi> when he has yawn'd,
and liſten'd, in vain, to the full Extent of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, for an
Opportunity to grow Eloquent on the Uſe of <hi>Colcheſter-Bays,</hi> falls
aſleep, in his Chair; and <hi>ſnores</hi> at us, in Revenge, to maintain
his Part in the Converſation.</p>
            <p>HONEST <hi>Sir Portly</hi> wou'd be often at a Loſs, to ſhape
ſuch ſtubborn <hi>Obliquities,</hi> into any <hi>direct Line</hi> of
Society, if he had not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, at his Elbow, the good-natur'd Mr. <hi>William
Weathercock,</hi> a Gentleman Farmer, in his Neighbourhood; who has a large,
but empty, Underſtanding.—The Mind of <hi>Will. Weathercock</hi> is
like the Sail of a great Ship, that has <hi>Room,</hi> to contain much Wind;
but, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none, of its own producing, is ſwell'd out, by Turns, from all
the Quarters of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. <hi>Will.</hi> hits every Man's Taſte; and is
of all People's Opinion. He is ſo deſirous to <hi>Oblige,</hi> that there
is not a Point in the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> but wou'd ſerve him for a <hi>Center.</hi> He is this Moment, in <hi>your</hi> Sentiment: and, the <hi>next,</hi> will, before your Face, be of his Opinion who contradicts you.
But, if a Third <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0199100801:154"/> affirms you <hi>Both</hi> to have been
in the Wrong, and appeals to <hi>Will. Weathercock:</hi>—<hi>Will,</hi>
with the beſt-bred Agility in the World, ſhifts, immediately, to <hi>his</hi> Side, too; and thinks it as clear as the Sun that You were, <hi>All Three,</hi> in the Right of it.</p>
            <p>THIS pliable Ductility, in the Reaſon of <hi>Will. Weathercock,</hi>
hitches in, and chains toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the moſt repugnant Idea's; and, uniting
them into an active Body, like the <hi>hook'd Atoms,</hi> of <hi>Des
Cartes,</hi> gives 'em Strength, Fluidity, and Conſequence. Such a lively
Effect have the very <hi>Weakneſſes</hi> of Humanity beyond the Force, and
Subtlety, of Ill-Nature, and Self-Intereſt!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tony Gingle,</hi> the laſt Time that I ſaw this Company
together, was ſo put to it, for an Opportunity, to repeat ſome Verſes, he
was <hi>big with,</hi> that, in order to <hi>bring 'em in,</hi> with a
tolerable Appearance of Propriety, he began, to compliment <hi>Sir
Portly</hi>'s Lady, on the Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Shape, and Skin, and inferring,
from their being Praiſe-worthy, that they ſhould lie open to Obſervation,
took Occaſion, by theſe Lines, to enforce his kind Opinion, that it was
neceſſary for her, to <hi>go naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <q> 
               <l>Can Forms, like yours, want Ornament of Dreſs?</l> 
               <l>Beauty, like <hi>Truth,</hi> ſhines moſt, in <hi>Nakedneſs.</hi>
               </l> 
               <l>Dreſſing, may skreen Deformities from View:</l> 
               <l>But, even, Adornment does but <hi>ſhadow you!</hi>
               </l> 
               <l>Moſt, but by what they wear are lovely made:</l> 
               <l>You, Madam, <hi>loſe,</hi> whene'er you ſeek ſuch Aid.</l> 
               <l>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0199100801:155"/>While others dreſs, their Lovers Hearts to
warm,</l> 
               <l>You <hi>put off</hi> nothing, but what <hi>veil'd</hi> a Charm!</l>
            </q>
            <p>THE Lady bluſh'd, and ſmil'd. <hi>Sir Portly</hi> laugh'd aloud;
and begg'd to hear 'em over again. For my Part, I was doubly pleas'd, with the
Turn of the Verſe; and Particularity of the Fancy. <hi>Tony Gingle,</hi>
himſelf, was in Raptures, which he cou'd not hide, at the Applauſe his
Muſe had met with.—But <hi>Tom Tireſome</hi> had been weighing with
the Foreſight of a prudent Citizen, the Ill Conſequence of <hi>going
naked,</hi> to his good Friends the <hi>Weavers,</hi> and felt a commendable
Indignation, againſt the tuneful Mr. <hi>Gingle</hi>; inſomuch that in the
Heat of his Reſentment, he call'd him <hi>Madman</hi>; and <hi>Ballad-Singer</hi>—Pray, what do you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſaid he, wou'd
become of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand honeſt People, who live, by making <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats,</hi> and what <hi>belongs</hi> to Petticoats, if all
handſome Women were to go <hi>impudently Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked!</hi>—Out upon it!
Methinks I <hi>ſee</hi> 'em; and am aſham'd of you! It is ſcandalous, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent; and to ſay nothing of the <hi>Plot,</hi> which may lie, conceal'd,
in it, againſt <hi>Trade</hi>; it is the Whim of a <hi>Heathen Turk</hi>! and
not fit to be thought of, in a <hi>Chriſtian-Country!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>TONY</hi> by this Time had fathom'd the <hi>Depth</hi> of his
Antagoniſt, and began to play upon him, from his Batteries of poetical
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; the War was growing hot: and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened dangerous Conſequences,
when <hi>Will. Weathercock</hi> put in, between 'em, and taking 
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0199100801:156"/> Part with the <hi>Wit,</hi> becauſe he obſerv'd him
to be a Favourite, made this Charge, upon his Oppoſite, like a brave and
faithful Auxiliary.</p>
            <p>YOU are certainly in the right, moſt divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Gingle!</hi>—Nature never wou'd have cover'd Women with ſuch white,
and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Skins, if ſhe had not meant 'em for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ornament. The
Ladies are Nature's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites; and, can we ſuppoſe her to have been
leſs liberal, to thoſe <hi>Favourites</hi>; than to the <hi>Beaſts,</hi>
which ſhe plac'd below 'em?—She never ſent us a <hi>Calf,</hi> but he
came into the World, with his <hi>Coat</hi> on. An <hi>Ox</hi> has no <hi>Breeches</hi> to pull off, when he goes to Bed weary. The <hi>Lamb</hi> is
born, ready dreſs'd, with her Freeze Coat about her. And who, ever, ſaw a <hi>Sow,</hi> drawing off her Shoes, and Stockings?—None ſleep ſofter
than the <hi>Birds</hi> do: Yet they riſe, in the Morning, with their
Feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, upon their Backs.—The moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, of the <hi>Virtues,</hi> are always painted, like <hi>Women</hi>; but it is, like <hi>Women, without Cloaths on!</hi> And, what does this mean, but to
inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, to the Sex, that all, who love Virtue, ſhou'd deſpiſe
Hoop-Petticoats, and <hi>go naked?</hi>—There is this manifeſt
Abſurdity in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Dreſſing, that it involves them in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
which make the chief End they dreſs for, much more difficult than it need be:
For, as they order the Matter, they are to be taken to Pieces, like <hi>Watches,</hi> before a Man can come <hi>near</hi> enough, to examine the <hi>Wonders</hi> of <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0199100801:157"/> their <hi>Workmanſhip.</hi>—<hi>Faſhions</hi> differ, in all Nations; and,
what is a fine Dreſs, in one Place, is a frightful one, in another. But, were
Women once uncover'd, all Mens Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wou'd agree, about 'em.—In a
Word, ſince the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> appear, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has made 'em; ſince all <hi>Animals</hi> are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with their own
natural Figures; and, ſince the <hi>Roſes</hi> are not aſham'd to ſhew
their <hi>Thorns,</hi> with their <hi>Beauties</hi>; why ſhou'd <hi>Woman,</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Maſterpiece! ſeek to hide, or diſguiſe, her
Lovelineſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WILL</hi> went, eloquently on, after this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Manner,
till he had fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, and ſatisfy'd, all that Part of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
who were on this firſt Side the Queſtion. But, caſting his Eye, on poor <hi>Tom Tireſome,</hi> and, pitying the melancholy Air, with which he
liſten'd to an Opinion, he had not Wit enough to argue againſt, though he
thought it little Better than Fornication, and Adultery;—<hi>Will,</hi>
in ſimple Honeſty of Heart; and out of a mere Motive of Compaſſion,
ſlipt, by a very ſudden Tranſition, into a ſure Method of comforting
him; and chang'd his <hi>Level,</hi> as follows.</p>
            <p>YET, I muſt do Juſtice to both Arguments, and it ſeems plain,
beyond Contradiction, that Beauty was <hi>made,</hi> to be <hi>ornamented.</hi>
The Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock's <hi>ſtarry Tail,</hi> ſhews, that Nature loves gay Fancies. <hi>Nature</hi> dreſs'd the Hills, and the Meadows, in their fine,
embroider'd Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0199100801:158"/> It was <hi>ſhe,</hi> that
ſpangled over all that glorious <hi>Veil,</hi> of Heaven!—Who, but <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſpotted the <hi>Ermin?</hi> And <hi>gilt</hi> the ſcaly
Skins, of Fiſhes, and of Serpents?—<hi>Man,</hi> indeed, ſhe ſent
into the World, plain, and naked:—Not, that ſhe meant, he ſhou'd <hi>remain</hi> ſo,—but, becauſe ſhe <hi>adorn'd</hi> all Things
elſe, for his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to chuſe a Dreſs from. What is the
Silkworm, but Nature's little <hi>Spinſter,</hi> ſet to Work for our common
Benefit? The very <hi>Spider</hi> keeps a <hi>Loom</hi>; and weaves a finer
Manufacture, than the Artiſts of <hi>Spittle-Fields,</hi> can!—Why
ſmell theſe love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flowers, round the Summer-Houſe we are ſitting in,
ſo delightfully ſweet, and fragrant, but to teach us, That we ſhou'd <hi>perfume</hi> our ſelves? And, to what End can we ſuppoſe they were
made, ſo various, in their Colours, but to give Ladies the happy Hint, of
employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Dyers,</hi> and <hi>Silk-weavers!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>TOM TIRESOME</hi> broke in upon him, at thoſe two inſpiring
Words, with a loud and triumphant <hi>Hollow</hi>; and filling, inſtantly, <hi>two Bumpers,</hi> drank Proſperity to <hi>Trade</hi>; and Health and
Happineſs to Mr. <hi>Weathercock.</hi>—His Toaſts went round the
Company; and both Parties were ſo well ſatisfied with the Share each had,
in his Deciſion, that Neither of them appear'd ſhock'd at the manifeſt
Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Reaſoning. But <hi>Tony Gingle</hi> went away, the
moſt pleas'd, of the Two; becauſe <hi>Sir Portly</hi> deſir'd him, at
parting, to repeat his Verſes, the third Time; and to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other 
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0199100801:159"/> Copy, againſt next Meeting, on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable uſe

                  <p>YOU obſerved, very juſtly, in one of your late Papers, that no
Figure in Life can be more graceful, and amiable, than that of a wiſe, and
good, Father; with Reſpect to an only Son, who poſſeſſes, and
deſerves, his Indulgence.</p>
                  <p>THAT Lover of Mankind, <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> gave us, lately, a
fine Example, of the Force of this Truth: But I look back, upon it with
Anguiſh, becauſe I judge of his preſent <hi>Pain,</hi> by the Exceſs of
his paſt <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THO' <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had, properly, but one Son, he was, in
ſome Senſe, the <hi>Common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0199100801:160"/>—Nothing ever was carried higher than the <hi>Manlineſs</hi>
of his Heart, except its <hi>Sweetneſs,</hi> and <hi>Humanity:</hi> For he
was ſoften'd, by the benevolent Overflowings of a Pity, that touch'd him, at
once, in the two <hi>Extremes</hi> of Senſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity! His own <hi>Joys</hi>
were damp'd, by other Peoples <hi>Afflictions</hi>; and his private <hi>Sorrows</hi> chear'd, by the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of thoſe who hated
him.—He not only <hi>forgave,</hi> readily, the moſt malicious of his
Enemies; but, that he might be ſure to do it, generouſly, he <hi>forgot</hi> the very <hi>Injuries.</hi>—Even his <hi>Faults</hi> were
no other, than the unſucceſsful Reſult of his <hi>Virtues</hi>; for
act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather by the meaſure of his <hi>Mind,</hi> than of his <hi>Power,</hi> he provok'd the Diſappointed; to whom the <hi>Will</hi> is no <hi>Obliger.</hi>—His <hi>Wit</hi> could fear no Rivals, but his <hi>Courage,</hi> and his <hi>Honeſty:</hi>—And every Perſon who
ſhall read this <hi>faint</hi> Character of his Excellence, has been oblig'd,
by the <hi>Effects</hi> of it; with regard to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Intereſt; and the
Ornaments of Society.</p>
                  <p>SUCH <hi>was Hortenſius!</hi>—and ſuch <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius
is;</hi> if yet he may be ſaid to <hi>be,</hi> after the Death of that dear <hi>Son,</hi> he <hi>liv'd in</hi>; and into whoſe fine Mind he had pour'd
out, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, all the Fullneſs of his Virtues; with a kind of Hope,
in <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his,</hi> to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortaliz'd his very <hi>Body!</hi> and to receive, from future Ages, in the Honours paid to his
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants, the Tribute of that <hi>Praiſe,</hi> which his own, declining
Life, is, now, too ſcanty to make Room for.</p>

                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0199100801:161"/>HE, who knows the Father's Proſpect; and how
ſuddenly <hi>Death</hi> has blaſted it; having ſnatch'd away the Son,
when juſt blooming into Manhood; and, already, the <hi>Companion,</hi> and
the <hi>Friend,</hi> of his Father! never look'd on, without Joy;—never
oblig'd, without Gratitude;—never thought on, without
Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;—never hearken'd to, without Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! muſt be touch'd
with a lively Senſe of what that Fate brought with it; which <hi>tore,</hi>
from ſuch a Parent! (who, before, had loſt the Mother,) ſuch a Son; to
leave him, <hi>joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>; with the <hi>future</hi> World before him, like
a bleak, and barren <hi>Deſart!</hi>—And the <hi>paſt,</hi> more
dreadful ſtill, by a thouſand goading Tenderneſſes; which cling for
ever to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; and torment, and ſting, Reflection.</p>
                  <p>WHAT is Life, when we conſider it under the Accidents it is liable
to, but an unreſting Conflict, in the Dark, with Labours, Doubts, and
Diſappointments!—One, ſuch Loſs, as <hi>Hortenſius</hi> has
ſuſtain'd, in this lov'd Son: (and ſo felt, too, as <hi>Hortenſius</hi>
feels it) ſerves, for ever, to imbitter <hi>Hope</hi>; and draws Gloom enough

wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, through my Eyes, at the moving Majeſty of his Sorrow.—He

whoſe Virtues, he had flatter'd himſelf, that his Old Age wou'd find a

inſtructed, Nations, with thoſe who govern'd, or conquer'd, them; <hi>Hortenſius</hi> need not bluſh, to ſee his Name, rank'd with <hi>Princes.</hi>—I will therefore inſtance an Example of a vaſter
Miſery than his own, in the <hi>greateſt Monarch</hi> of our Age: (why did
I not ſay <hi>of any Age?</hi>) I mean the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia:</hi>—A Prince! whoſe Actions will draw after him a

Imputation, that he pardon'd his Condemn'd Son, in Perſon, in the moſt
tender, and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Manner, after he had been <hi>ſentenc'd to Death,</hi>
not by the <hi>Czar himſelf,</hi> but by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi>
Eccleſiaſtical,—Civil,—and Military:—for having (to uſe
the very Words of the Sentence) <hi>Form'd a Deſign to get the Crown even in

                        <p>YOU cannot be ignorant, ſince it is known to all the World, to
what Degree our People groan'd, under the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
We ſaw, by the Loſs of our <hi>Maritime Provinces,</hi> that we were cut
off from all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the reſt of the World. You know, too, what it
coſt us, in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this War, to qualify ourſelves to give a
Check to ſo implacable a Violence. But God led us by the Hand, till we were
wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, in our Turn, to make that Enemy trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0199100801:166"/>
before whom others had, long, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.—We owe this, next to God, to our
own, unwearied Toil; and the Affection of our <hi>Beſt Children,</hi> our
faithful, <hi>Ruſſian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT, if, while I am viewing this Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my Native
Country, I turn an Eye to <hi>my own Poſterity,</hi> my Heart is oppreſs'd,
with <hi>Grief,</hi> that is too heavy for my <hi>Glory.</hi>—I ſee <hi>You,</hi> my Son! rejecting all the Means of becoming able to protect, or
govern, what I <hi>leave</hi> you.—You will not ſo much as hear of <hi>Warlike Study</hi>; tho' by <hi>that only</hi> we broke out of the
Obſcurity we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in; and made ourſelves <hi>notic'd</hi> among

                        <p>I DO not exhort You to <hi>make War,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Reaſon</hi>;—I but preſs you to learn the <hi>Art</hi> of it. I
cou'd place before your Eyes many <hi>Proofs,</hi> that this is neceſſary:
But I will name the <hi>Greeks,</hi> only; for they are united in the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> with us.—What, but Neglect of <hi>Arms,</hi> was the
Occaſion of their Ruin? Reſt, and Idleneſs, had weaken'd them, till they
cou'd <hi>ſubmit,</hi> even to <hi>Slavery!</hi> You miſtake, if you think
it enough, for a Prince to have <hi>Good Generals.</hi> Men look up, to the <hi>Head:</hi> They examine <hi>his</hi> Inclinations, that they may conform

                        </p>
                        <p>YOU hate <hi>War:</hi>—You neglect it:—You will,
conſequently, never learn it.—<hi>How,</hi> then, can you <hi>command
others?</hi>—How <hi>judge,</hi> of the Rewards, which ſhou'd encourage
the <hi>Deſerving?</hi> or the Puniſhments, which muſt be held out, to
the Eyes of the <hi>Unworthy?</hi>—You will ſee, and hear, for ever,

conceals, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, he ſhou'd employ!—and falls back, from the
glorious <hi>Truſt,</hi> which God has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd him by!</p>
                        <p>REMEMBER your long Obſtinacy—and become generouſly
aſham'd, of this Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your Nature.—How often have I
reproach'd You! Nay, ſometimes, you have compell'd my Affection even to <hi>puniſh</hi> you!—For ſome Years paſt, I have ſcarce ſpoke
to you.—Yet, all this avail'd nothing.—It was <hi>loſing</hi> my <hi>Time!</hi>—It was <hi>ſtriking</hi> the <hi>Air!</hi>—All
your Pleaſure conſiſts in Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence! Things, of which you ought to be

                        <p>AFTER having weigh'd, in my ſecret Breaſt, the fatal Tendency

I have endeavour'd to redeem you: I have thought fit, by my own Hand-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to give you the <hi>laſt Reſult</hi> of my Will.—With this
Determination, however,—to wait, ſtill, ſome Time longer, before I
put it in Execution; to expect, or <hi>hope,</hi> your Amendment:—If <hi>not,</hi> you are, hereby, to know, that I will <hi>deprive you of the

            <p>THE <hi>Coquette,</hi> and <hi>Ned Volatile,</hi> have been Indulged
in their Propenſities to talk, and, enjoyed their Humour and Pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
nay, they have been permitted to break in upon one another, ſometimes, with
unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Vollies of Raillery, which might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, have been carried to
unwarrantable Lengths, and attended with ill Conſequences, if they had not
been over-awed by the Preſence of us, of a more ſedate Turn; and
ſometimes, ſeaſonably parted, by the Interpoſition of the <hi>Major,</hi> and timely relieved from one another in thoſe brisk

            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0199100801:170"/>IF an Account of the little Infirmities of this
pair of Scufflers has had its proper Tendency towards the Cure of any <hi>noted
Impertinents,</hi> of either Sex, who have a Flux in their Tongues, I ſhall
not think that I have as yet offended the Gravity of my Character, or loſt
any Time, in penning down ſuch Levities, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which, rightly
convey'd, produces Conſequences of ſo much Importance to the Quiet and
Repoſe of the more ſerious part of the Human Species. Thus far I can ſay,
from what has fallen within my own Obſervation, That ſeveral gay Parts,
which I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, of the Converſation between <hi>Ned</hi> and the <hi>Coquette,</hi> have excited an unuſual Vein of Merriment among many of my
young Readers; but, tho' I muſt confeſs, I had a ſecret <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> in finding them <hi>pleaſed</hi>; I ſhould have been
delighted, in a more exquiſite Degree, if my Writings, taking a better
Effect, had ſtir'd up, in ſome of them, whom it wou'd have become, a little
more <hi>Self-Reflection,</hi> and <hi>leſs Laughter.</hi> They who only
laugh at the Follies of others, give me the worſt half of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe;
I ſhall never be compleatly pleas'd, till I can teach them to laugh at
themſelves: they think me a pleaſant and facetious old Fellow, but I wou'd
be, at the ſame Time, a uſeful and a profitable Companion.</p>
            <p>I LATELY ſaw the moſt penetrating pair of Eyes that ever ſhone
upon Paper, very buſily employed upon that <hi>Plain-Dealer,</hi> wherein I
deſcribed the laſt Tongue-Skirmiſh, between <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0199100801:171"/> the <hi>Two Talkatives</hi> of our <hi>Aſſembly.</hi> She read it to herſelf,
and ever, now and then, laugh'd out heartily. I could gueſs, by obſerving
her Eye, what Paſſages tickled her the moſt, and found 'em to be thoſe,
which threw the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Humour of the two Combatants into the ſtrongeſt
Pitch of Ridicule. I was in hopes, That, if any of that Female Infirmity, which
ſhe ſo heartily laugh'd at in others, fell to her Share, ſhe would ever
after carefully avoid appearing in the ſame Light, in which ſhe had ſeen
her Neighbour make ſo ungraceful a Figure, and whom ſhe confeſs'd, by
ſuch <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Signs,</hi> to be a proper Object of Ridicule. But, to
my very great Wonder, ſhe no ſooner laid the Paper out of her Hands, but
ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently exerciſed thoſe Lips, with ten times more Velocity in <hi>Talking,</hi> than they ſeem'd to have in the <hi>Courſe</hi> of their <hi>Reading.</hi> Her Tongue out-gallop'd the <hi>Coquette</hi>'s; and I am
perſuaded, if <hi>Ned Volatile</hi> had been to ſtart with her upon equal
Terms, ſhe would fairly have diſtanced <hi>him</hi>; he would have loſt
Sight of her in the firſt Flight: Up got I, (no Room being given to take
Leave) and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, as faſt as my Oaken-ſtick would help me; and have
been mightily diſcouraged, to ſee the little Effects of my
Performances.—I warrant this Goſſip, told the next Company ſhe fell
into, That ſhe read my <hi>Paper,</hi> and the Moment after, in utter
Contempt of the Moral palpably contained in it, bolted away into numberleſs
Fooleries, and as many Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0199100801:172"/> as before. But can
this pert Fair-One be properly ſaid to have <hi>read</hi> the PLAIN-DEALER?
No, ſhe <hi>ſaw</hi> it, but did not <hi>read</hi> it. At this Rate I
muſt be obliged to turn <hi>Lecturer</hi> upon my own Works, and where there
are any genteel Hints, ſubſtitute rougher, and coarſer, in their Room,
that they may not be too deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and eſcape Obſervation. It is the Sign
of a well-manner'd Writer, juſt to touch upon the Verge of a ſevere Truth,
and leave the reſt to a Reader's private Meditation. But if this Method
proves ineffectual, it is next to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to preſerve the Character
of a PLAIN-DEALER, without ſaying ſomething that may penetrate, more
violently. I ſhall, therefore for the Future, without Scruple, declare, that
any Eyes, let them appear never ſo beautiful, which at once look over, and
overlook, theſe Papers, are in a Manner as bad as blind; and that the only
Grace in beautiful Lips, which are almoſt always in Motion, and ſcarce ever
to the Purpoſe, conſiſts in the Propriety of their Colour, which ſhews,
as if they bluſh'd, with a Senſe of their own Impertinence.</p>
            <p>THE Gentlemen run over my Papers, as well as the Ladies, without
reading them. They conceive a Jeſt on ſome particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then
laugh; and become more a Jeſt themſelves: yet will not conſider, till
they are told in plain Terms, that each of them is that <hi>particular
Perſon.</hi>

            <p>THE odd Spark, whom my Correſpondent, fair <hi>Cleora,</hi> very

               <hi>Reverſed,</hi> is the ſame odd Spark he was, and, what is worſe, has
ſince that Time brought over Hundreds of Proſelytes, to the ſame ſilly
Faſhion; ſo that one would be apt to imagine, there is nothing more
wanting, to make a Dreſs very popular, but ſhewing it firſt to be very
ridiculous. There ſeems to be a general Emulation among the
Faſhion-Mongers, which of them can be the moſt Whimſical, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Men have condeſcended to come into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, which makes them appear to
have no Heads at all, or as if half the Head, lay hid in the Bag behind it.</p>
            <p>IT is an extraordinary Entertainment to ſee the whole <hi>Mall</hi>
crowded with this kind of Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; and yet more ſo, when examining theſe
Childiſh Figures, you read in their Faces, that they generally conſiſt of
Perſons from Five and Twenty, to upwards of Forty Years of Age. Some Fops of
Fifty-odd, make the firſt Decays of Age remarkable in them by this Dreſs,
which would be otherwiſe unnoticed. A jolly old Friend of mine, was taking an
Airing with me in the Park the other Day, 
<q rend="inline">'What muſt be in theſe Peoples Minds, <hi>ſaid
he,</hi> that, in order to look Gay, appear Hoary, like the Pictures of <hi>Old
Winter,</hi> when every Thing looks flouriſhing about them? The very Breezes
blow to refreſh them, and ſweep <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0199100801:174"/> away the Load of
Duſt, which wou'd ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them if they had not ingeniouſly prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, by a Cement of Orange-Butter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>CAN any of theſe Sparks <hi>pretend</hi> to read my Papers; who,
without looking into their Minds, continue to cultivate the Outſide of their
Heads after ſuch a prodigious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous Rate! As to the Powderers
of Fifty, I muſt tell them, that even I, who am in my grand Climacterick, and
have gone thro' the Snow of ſo many Winters, am not half ſo much powder'd
as they, and that therefore it cannot look decent in them.</p>
            <p>IF we ſurvey from the Head downwards, every Part of their Dreſs,
there is not one, but what is prepoſterous.</p>
            <p>IF a Man, for Example, was to take a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the Officers and
Soldiers, provided they had Sleeves of the Modern Cut, he would take them for
an Army of Invalids. The Company of <hi>Taylors</hi> ſeem to have forgot
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and want the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Barber-Surgeons,</hi>
to inſtruct them in the Rules of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, without which, the Elbows of Men
are viſibly out of Joint, and can never be ſet cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly.</p>
            <p>THE young Fellows have drop'd down the Flaps of their Coats, very near
as Low as the Clocks of their Stockings, ſo that ſcarce any thing of the
Leg is to be ſeen but Ancle; and they ſeem to be pulling them ſtill lower
and lower, that they may be more and more like Petticoats, which the Women are,
grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0199100801:175"/> tucking up ſhorter and ſhorter, that
there will be a decent Neceſſity for converting them into <hi>Breeches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I obſerve, that the Ladies go open-breaſted in <hi>Winter,</hi> tho' the Dappers button up to the Chin in <hi>Summer</hi>; and
have garniſhed the Folds of their Coats with Supernumerary Buttons, the Uſe
of which I cannot poſſibly learn, tho' I have applied to thoſe who are
very deeply read. I would propoſe Buttons and Button-holes down the Seam of
the Back, that they may be button'd up to the Poll, as they are to the Chin,
which will be of great Uſe, when, they are lazy; for they may be unbutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as Ladies are unlac'd, <hi>behind,</hi> by a Servant.</p>
            <p>IF theſe Alterations ſhould be carried on a little further, my
Friend <hi>Gunter</hi>'s Predictions, concerning the Mutation of Sexes, muſt
be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be punctually verified.</p>
            <p>WHAT I moſt fear is, leſt our Merchants and others, whoſe
Affairs have kept them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years beyond Sea, ſhou'd be ſurprized, at
their Return, to find us dreſs'd after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Mode, hear our Officers

            </head>
            <p>IT has been remark'd in the <hi>Courſe</hi> of theſe PAPERS, that
among the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> there are none more <hi>Fooliſh</hi> than the <hi>Witty:</hi> May it not with great Truth be ſaid, That, among the merely <hi>Witty,</hi> none are more <hi>ridiculed</hi> than the <hi>Wiſe?</hi> If a <hi>Clergyman</hi> offers to ſpeak, the <hi>Witlings</hi> foretel <hi>Dullneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the Caſe is quite otherwiſe with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a ſerious
Caſt of Thought, who know, that, as <hi>Truth</hi> is the only Mean, by which <hi>Divines</hi> can ſurely inſtruct, ſo their <hi>Stile</hi> muſt be
peculiarly clear, which, without ſtopping at <hi>Brightneſs,</hi> purſues <hi>Solidity.</hi> I am therefore fully ſatisfy'd, that, that Grave Claſs
of my <hi>Readers,</hi> whom I count doing me an Honour, when I ſee them clap
on their Spectacles to read my <hi>Works,</hi> as if they thought they could
meet with Improvement from them, after their <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0199100801:177"/> own long
Experience of the <hi>World,</hi> will be pleaſed with the following <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> which the <hi>Clergyman</hi> made, the other Day, upon
that <hi>Virtue</hi> call'd <hi>Plain-Dealing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider that every Body, ſaid he, is continually
recommending the <hi>Subject</hi> of your <hi>Papers</hi> in common
Converſation, one would think there was little need for a Writer to employ
his Time upon it: But when we reflect how few practiſe it, <hi>no
Subject</hi> requires more <hi>Pains</hi> to inforce it. People praiſe it
every <hi>Day,</hi> and violate it every <hi>Hour,</hi> and <hi>common
Honeſty,</hi> like <hi>common Senſe,</hi> is boldly pretended to by <hi>every Body,</hi> but really poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by <hi>few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT muſt be worth a little of our <hi>Meditation</hi> to inform
ourſelves, how this <hi>Quality</hi> comes to be ſo Valuable among us, and
yet we ſo frequently and ſo eaſily part with it; in ſhort, by what <hi>Myſtery</hi> in our <hi>Conduct</hi> ſuch Numbers of Men, would appear
to be what they are not.</p>
            <p>WE ſee upon the firſt Moment's Reflection, that PLAIN-DEALING is
the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip</hi>; it is the neceſſary <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it; and, when that is once gone, the moſt warm and
lively <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacies</hi> can no longer ſubſiſt: They grow cold and dye
at once. Now <hi>Friendſhips,</hi> we all know, are the very Bonds of <hi>Society</hi>; again, we as clearly comprehend, that what we call, a <hi>Good Underſtanding,</hi> among publick Bodies of Men, (which cannot be
maintained but by <hi>Fair-Dealings</hi>) is the Prop and Support of every
Civilized <hi>Government.</hi> Since we are ſo <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0199100801:178"/> ſoon
and ſo perfectly convinced, that <hi>Plain-Dealing</hi> carries along with it
ſuch Advantages, it is no wonder, that we ſhould deſire to be reckoned
the Poſſeſſors of ſo valuable a <hi>Good.</hi> It is Natural for us
to deſire it; it is in this Senſe ſcarce a Vertue; for, morally
ſpeaking, it is what we cannot help deſiring. Every Mortal breathing has
felt the firſt Principles of <hi>Honeſty</hi> very ſtrong in his Heart;
and even he that departed from it, knows his Struggle was very great. It is the
Quality he covets to find in every one with whom he converſes, and he
ſecretly adores the Man in whom he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to meet it.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, if <hi>Plain-Dealing</hi> had not all theſe
attractive <hi>Charms,</hi> yet there is ſomething ſo ridiculous and
unpopular in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Double upon Mankind; there is ſuch a Baſeneſs
in the doing of it, ſuch an Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of doing it often without
being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſuch an irretrievable Ignominy, ſuch a quick and
painful Remorſe, that a <hi>Life</hi> of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation is full enough of
Horror to fright Men from it, if a <hi>Life</hi> of Honeſty had not Charms to
tempt, and invite us.</p>
            <p>SURE then it is a Riddle, that we are not like the People we <hi>Love,</hi> but the People we <hi>Hate.</hi> The meaneſt Slave cannot bear
to be called a Diſſembler, and yet the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes do not bluſh
to diſſemble. <hi>Qui neſcit Diſſimulare, neſcit Regnare,</hi> is
grown their Political Motto. Stateſmen originally meant the ſame as <hi>Faithful</hi> Servants of a <hi>State</hi>; <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0199100801:179"/> they are
now adays called <hi>Politicians,</hi> and Politican is little more than a new
Name for <hi>Deceiver.</hi> Even Religious Perſons have enter'd into a
Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Plain-Dealing</hi>; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers, in Holy
Orders, have cauſed, <hi>In ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Sacerdoti,</hi> to ſignify a <hi>Falſhood,</hi> and <hi>Nolo Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copare</hi> to ſtand for deſiring
earneſtly what a Man pretends to <hi>decline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole it is nothing but Folly and Cowardice, that ſeduces
Men firſt out of the plain Road of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> into
the By-ways of <hi>Double-Dealing?</hi> and, when once <hi>Cunning</hi> took
the Place of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in Mens Minds, and <hi>Fear</hi> inſtead of
Reſolution govern'd their Hearts; they at length brought <hi>Double-Dealing</hi> (which was, at firſt, a <hi>Crime,</hi> by <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident</hi>) thro' a long and conſtant Habit, to be no leſs than an <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH a Duty as <hi>Plain-Dealing,</hi> cannot be too much known, and
nothing is learnt, more eaſily; but then in a Corrupt Age nothing is ſo
eaſily loſt: in a depraved and impious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, nothing is ſo readily
parted from.</p>
            <p>THE Clergy have a Right to diffuſe among the People this Spirit of
Honeſty, by Precept, and a more particular Duty, incumbent upon them, to
enforce it by Example. But too many among them have ſuch a Taſte for
world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſt, as to have loſt the Reliſh of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Religion; and
while they profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Prieſts,</hi> appear aſhamed, to be
thought Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0199100801:180"/>AS there is nothing nobler than a good Prieſt;
ſo there is nothing ſo ſhocking and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, as to ſee a baſe Man
of that Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which annexes Reverend to his Name. A Layman, that
does not reverence a good Paſtor, is a Profligate: But a wicked Man, in holy
Orders, is a Monſter. The Ancients, when they drew the Pictures of Beauty and
Uglineſs, took Pieces from ſeveral Objects, the better to compleat their
Deſign. In order to excite true Horror againſt wicked Prelates I ſhall
uſe the ſame Liberty, and draw from the wickedeſt, I have heard of, a
kind of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical <hi>Caligula,</hi> and ſuppoſe him to be a
Biſhop, to give him the Fulneſs of his Deformity: I ſhall then give the
Sketch of a virtuous Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick; but muſt remark, for the Honour of
Prieſthood, that the ill Character is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a great many <hi>Double-Dealers,</hi> and that the good one, did really belong to one good
Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>UMBRA</hi> was always a great Pretender to Virtue and Piety, but
never Poſſeſſor of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honeſty: He made Godlineſs his Gain, and
never eſpouſed the Intereſts of Virtue, but with the View of puſhing
his own. <hi>Umbra</hi> cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inordinately; but never once pray'd hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
In order to ingratiate himſelf with great Families, he applied himſelf to
learn a falſe kind of Oratory, and grew a famed Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and Compoſer
of Funeral Sermons, in which he would ſalve up the Vices of great Men, in
favour of Death-bed Repentance; <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0199100801:181"/> and demonſtrate very
elaborately, how the Virtue of a Moment, could atone the Impiety of an Age. If
he dined at a Nobleman's Table, he ſaid a ſcanty Grace to a full Meal, and
would juſt dip down his Head to the great Author, who multiplies Food for the
Uſe and Benefit of his Creatures; but, before he ſeated himſelf, would
make a profound Reverence to the Debauchee that entertain'd him. When he grew,
by theſe Means, acquainted with great Men, he turn'd Politician, and raiſed
himſelf up on the blind Side of one, by ſetting him at Variance with
another: He next became a State Preacher, and changed his Note as the Times
changed, ſo that there were many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of his, direct Contradictions to
each other. He ſold the Goſpel by Retale, and lived long in Grandeur, by
debaſing Chriſtianity: he has ſometimes taken Delight in abuſing the
very Prieſthood, and triumph'd in a Biſhoprick, when he deſerv'd to be
excommunicated. Thus veſted, unhappily, with Prelatical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he would
ruin his honeſt Inferiors, and if they ſought Juſtice, terrify them by
his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege. This <hi>Double-Dealer,</hi> with a Mitre on his Head, lived
prevaricating for many Years, and then died as he lived, leaving ſuch
Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods under his Hand on his Death-bed, as if the Meaſure of his Days
had been too ſhort for his Prevarication.</p>
            <p>THERE was ſuch a Perſon lately living as <hi>Cordatus,</hi> who
had an honourable Poſt in the Church. He belong'd to a great Cathedral, 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0199100801:182"/> and was really a Perſon of Quality; joining the
Gentleman with the Chriſtian, he was both Religious and Polite. He had this
peculiar Felicity in his Temper, that, though he lived in an Age of Faction, he
judged many, of a different Opinion from himſelf, to be honeſt and
well-meaning Men, and, by treating them as ſuch, won them over to his
Opinion. He never uſed his Authority but to quiet Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to make or
renew Friendſhips, and to eſtabliſh Peace, good Will, and Union. He was
learned and wiſe, and tho' he had an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment in his Speech, he preached
clearly to the Underſtanding. He never choſe that Oratory, which tends more
to nouriſh Pride in the Speaker, than to inſtil Virtue into the Hearer. He
knew it his Duty to inſtruct the Ignorant, and therefore ſtudied
Perſpicuity, in all that he deliver'd from the Pulpit. He made Virtue the
Study of one part of his Life, and the other was taken up with the Labour of
communicating what he had learnt, for the Uſe and Inſtruction of others. He
never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed any thing that might make other Men better; ſave one, and
that was his Charity. All knew he recommended what he acted, and finding the
Preacher in earneſt, the Hearers were ſo too. Nothing among <hi>his</hi>
Pariſhioners, was deliver'd over to Shame, but Impiety. He lived thus for
many Years a general Bleſſing, and his Death was a Common Calamity. The
Poor loſt a Benefactor, the Rich a valuable <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0199100801:183"/> Friend,
and every individual Man of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, an exemplary Companion.</p>
            <p>I MUST, before I conclude, adviſe all Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen not to fix any
Parts in the Deſcription of <hi>Umbra,</hi> upon any particular Perſons
they may not think well of; becauſe that will be ſhewing, they have ſome
of his Spirit: Let them rather ſtudy to live like <hi>Cordatus,</hi> that
they may die with his Character. What ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies finding out who is meant by <hi>Umbra,</hi> or who is <hi>Cordatus?</hi> The profitable Search will be to
examine what Parts they have acted like <hi>Umbra,</hi> and amend them; and, in
what they have perſonated <hi>Cordatus,</hi> and improve them: If they do
otherwiſe, they will imitate the Dog in the Fable, and, by catching at the
Shadow, loſe the Subſtance of my Diſſertation.</p>

our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is a Double-Dealer, and for want of ſettled Uſage, and a

                  <p>THIS, however, <hi>en paſſant</hi> only, for I am Maſter of <hi>better</hi> Sciences; ſuch as are new, even in <hi>Theory.</hi> But, not

                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0199100801:187"/> I AM, you muſt know, then, a kind of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Anatomiſt:</hi> I can diſſect an <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>;
or diſembowel a <hi>Quality:</hi> I am about to make publick Profeſſion
of my Art: And having my <hi>Chariot</hi> as good as ready, the reſt of my <hi>Apparatus</hi> will be, comparatively, of no Conſequence. I ſhall <hi>drive</hi> faſt into <hi>Practice.</hi> But the chief Scruple I labour
under, is, by what Title to diſtinguiſh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: I wou'd make uſe of
the Word <hi>Doctor,</hi> but that the College of Phyſicians, who place much
Learning in <hi>Privilege,</hi> wou'd have me aſcend, by <hi>Degrees,</hi> to
that Dignity: Which is too phlegmatic a Preſcription to agree with my Temper.
I am, therefore, inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſince very much of my Practice will lie among
the Ladies, to call myſelf a <hi>Mind-Midwife:</hi> Inſinuating, by that
Hint, That I can ſee 'em as ſafely brought to Bed of their <hi>Affectation,</hi> and other <hi>ſpiritual Conceptions,</hi> as they can
be aſſiſted, in their <hi>Matrimonal Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies,</hi> by the bodily
Brothers of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt Patient I propoſe to <hi>lay,</hi> is a pregnant <hi>Male</hi> Member of that learned <hi>College</hi> I was mentioning. To be a <hi>Doctor</hi>'s <hi>Doctor,</hi> is, to cure, in the beſt Light
poſſible: And I wou'd emulate the Example of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Magician, <hi>Zyto,</hi> who was ſent for, ſays a <hi>grave</hi> Hiſtorian, by the
Emperor <hi>Charles the</hi> IVth; to try his Skill, againſt a <hi>High
German Conjurer; Zyto,</hi> who was a <hi>White</hi> Wizard, and worth a
Hundred of your <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0199100801:188"/> 
                     <hi>Fauſtus</hi>'s; ſtood, in
Preſence of the Emperor, and, with inflexible Compoſure, obſerv'd the
Inſtances of his Rival's Art; who ſwallow'd, at laſt, a burning
Horſe-ſhoe: And defy'd our <hi>Zyto,</hi> to do it after him. But <hi>Zyto</hi> choſe, rather (that he might end the Diſpute, at a <hi>Morſel</hi>) to ſwallow the <hi>Conjurer himſelf!</hi> And expanding
his Mouth into horrible, and inhuman, Wideneſs, ſnapt him up, like a
Radiſh! But, when he came to his dirty Shoes, and diſdain'd to ſwallow
farther, he ran with him, to a Horſe-pond, hard by; and launch'd him out into
the middle of it; to the no ſmall Entertainment, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the
Company.</p>
                  <p>THE Name of my future Patient, is <hi>Sir Clouterly Rumble:</hi> a
Profeſſor, of the <hi>Eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian,</hi> as well as the <hi>Medicinal</hi>
Order. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, on his Countenance, the cleareſt Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of his
Grievance: Which is a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that ſome moral Doctors have
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by the Name of <hi>Vanity.</hi> It operates, with moſt
Violence, on the Head, and the Heart; tho' it affects the Limbs alſo: And,
ſometimes ſwells the whole Frame, into the moſt enormous <hi>Turgidity.</hi> It ſhakes the <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> of this afflicted
Gentleman, with a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Convulſion of the Nerves; during which Fits, it is
dangerous to let <hi>Paper</hi> lie in his way: For he applies himſelf, with
the wildeſt Ecſtaſy to ſtrike it over, at Random, with odd Lines,
crooked Cyphers, and Characters, wholly unintelligible! to the pitiful
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting, <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0199100801:189"/> and Perplexity, of his Brain: Which,
becoming heated, <hi>praeter-naturally,</hi> by ſuch extravagant Agitation,
inflames, and nouriſhes his Malady.</p>
                  <p>IT was a laudable Accompliſhment, that of calculating Diſtempers
by examining the Patient's <hi>Water!</hi> In Imitation of this good Cuſtom,
I poured out, before me, a large Quantity of the ſick Man's <hi>Proſaic,</hi> and <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Emiſſions</hi>; and upon inſpecting
the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> annex'd to one of 'em which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, poor
Gentleman! to an Illuſtrious young Prince in <hi>Germany,</hi> with as grave,
and ſerious an Air, as if it was really, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fit to be look'd upon!
I preſently diſcovered both the Diſtemper, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Cure for it.
The <hi>Tokens,</hi> as far as I can remember, were Strongeſt, and moſt
Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, upon the following Eruption of puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Matter, from a Complication

himſelf wou'd have it go by, is ALFRED. It is, in ſhort, a moſt

                  </opener>
                  <p>HAVING obſerv'd, That my <hi>Extract</hi> of the CZAR of <hi>RUSSIA</hi>'s <hi>Letter to his SON,</hi> which you publiſh'd in your 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0199100801:195"/> 20th Paper, gave a very great Surprize to the Generality
of your Readers, who had form'd, upon common Rumour, an Opinion of that
Prince's Death, extremely different from the Truth; I now ſend you as brief
an Abſtract as poſſible, from a Relation, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in <hi>High Dutch,</hi> by the Miniſter of a <hi>German Court,</hi> not likely
to be partial in Favour of the <hi>Czar,</hi> and who was preſent, and an
Eye-Witneſs of the Facts, which he publiſhes.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Czar</hi> had long inclin'd to ally him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome
powerful Family of <hi>Germany,</hi> by the Marriage of his Son; whom he hop'd
to reclaim from his Indolence, by the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of a Princeſs of high
Extraction, and a noble Education: For this Prince had, by a continual
aſſociating himſelf with the vileſt Company, contracted ſuch corrupt
Habits, as could not fail of producing an Averſion to him, in all honeſt
Minds. He was ſo far ſunk in Senſuality, that no Repreſentations, no
Pains, could recover him: So that the <hi>Czar,</hi> being, at length, by his
Son's perverſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, almoſt brought to an Abhorrence of his Perſon,
began to drop Intimations, That he wou'd cauſe him to be ſhav'd for a Monk,
and ſhut him up in a Convent.—The Prince's own Favourites were alarm'd
at the Danger; and earneſtly entreated him to have his Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare at Heart; and
to conceal, if he cou'd not ſuppreſs, his rigorous Hatred againſt
Foreigners. This diſpos'd him to fall in with <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0199100801:196"/> the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Propoſition, and he was married, as is well known, to a
Princeſs, of the Family of <hi>Brunſwick Wolfenbuttel,</hi> and Siſter to
the preſent Empreſs.</p>
                  <p>BUT, after he had brought her to <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> he ſhew'd
not the leaſt Complaiſance; nor endeavour'd, at all, to divert
her.—On the contrary, I obſerv'd, That, on all Publick Occaſions, he
never exchang'd a Word with her; but, induſtriouſly ſhun'd her Company.
The Prince had the Apartments of the right Wing; and the Princeſs thoſe of
the Left: But they ſaw each other ſcarce once a Week; and, had not the
Prince conſider'd the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Heir, as the Support of his own Safety,
he would have made himſelf intirely inviſible to her. He even neglected the
Repair of the Houſe, to that Degree, that the Princeſs lay expos'd to the
Injuries of the Air, and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in her own Bedchamber.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the <hi>Czar</hi> expoſtulated with him, concerning theſe
Proceedings, he loaded <hi>her</hi> with Reproaches, as if it was ſhe, who
had accus'd him; whereas, that wiſe Princeſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her hard Fate,
with the firmeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Reſignation; nor had any other
Witneſſes of her Tears, but the Princeſs of <hi>Eaſt-Freiſland,</hi>
her Companion, and the Walls of her own Apartment. She liv'd, four Years, in
this Manner, and was then ſeiz'd with an Indiſpoſition, ſo dangerous,
that her Recovery was immediately deſpair'd of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0199100801:197"/>WHEN ſhe perceiv'd her End approaching,
ſhe deſir'd to ſee the <hi>Czar,</hi> who was, at the ſame Time,
indiſpos'd: But he caus'd himſelf to be carry'd to her, in a Machine, mov'd
on Wheels.—The Princeſs took her Leave of him, in the moſt moving
Expreſſions; and recommended her two Children to his Care and Protection;
embracing them, in the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der manner poſſible; and almoſt melting
away in Tears. Then, ſhe ſent for her Servants, who, to the Number of two
hundred Perſons, and upwards, lay proſtrate, in the Anti-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
imploring Heaven to aſſiſt their dying Miſtreſs, in her laſt
Agonies.—She comforted, admoniſhed, and gave them her

                  <p>MANY further Attempts the <hi>Czar</hi> made, on his Son's
Obſtinacy: But the Conſequence of them all; and of his pretended
Reſignation, was his Flight to a Foreign Protection, and a plunging himſelf
into thoſe High Crimes which are particulariz'd, in his Sentence.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Czar,</hi> upon this extraordinary and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Occaſion, convok'd a High Court of Juſtice; conſiſting of all the <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>States.</hi> 
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0199100801:199"/>—He lay, for
eight Days, ſucceſſively, many Hours, on his Knees; imploring God, with
Tears, to inſpire him with Sentiments, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his double Duty—as a <hi>Monarch,</hi> and as a <hi>Father.</hi>—The Prince was brought into
Court, under Guard of four Officers; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt, in a Manner too
tedious, and circumſtantial, to be particulariz'd in ſo ſhort a
Compaſs.</p>
                  <p>THE Court, upon the whole, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd a formal Sentence, and
condemn'd the Prince to Death, the violent Surprize and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his Mind,
and the diſorderly Conflict and Fluctuation of his Paſſions, threw him
into an Apoplectick Fit. The <hi>Czar</hi> no ſooner heard, that he was in
this Danger, and that he was deſirous to ſee him, but he viſited his
dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Son, with the moſt viſible Marks of Pity, and a Proof of Paternal
Tenderneſs.</p>
                  <p>THE Prince, at Sight of his Father, burſt out into Tears; and,
with Hands, rais'd, and folded, ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'He had grievouſly offended the Majeſty of
Almighty God, and the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Czar</hi>—; that he had not
even a Wiſh, to recover from his Indiſpoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthy to live
longer. He begg'd his Majeſty, for God's ſake, only to take from him the
Curſe, he had laid on him, at <hi>Moskow:</hi> to forgive him all his heavy
Crimes; to impart him his Bleſſing; and, to cauſe Prayers to be put up
for his Soul.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>DURING theſe moving Words, the <hi>Czar,</hi> and the whole Court,
almoſt melted away, in <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0199100801:200"/> Tears.—His Majeſty
return'd him a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and pathetic, Anſwer: He repreſented, in a
few, of the mildeſt Words, he cou'd ſelect, all his <hi>Length</hi> of
Offences; and then, gave him, in the moſt touching Manner poſſible, his
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and his Bleſſing: After which, they parted, with abundance
of Tears, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, on both Sides.</p>
                  <p>VERY late, in the Night, came a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to acquaint the <hi>Czar,</hi> that the Prince was extremely deſirous, once more, to ſee
his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And his Majeſty had juſt ſtept into his Sloop, to go over to
the Fortreſs, when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meſſenger brought News, that the Prince was
already expir'd.—He was depoſited in the new Burying-Vault, of the <hi>Czariſh</hi> Family; and plac'd next the Coffin of his late
Conſort.—The <hi>Czar,</hi> among the Mourners, carried a lighted
Wax-Taper, in his Hand; and was obſerv'd to be bath'd in Tears, during the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; and, in particular, at the Church Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; where the Prieſt
had choſe, for the Text of his Funeral Sermon, theſe Words of the mournful <hi>David,—O! my Son Abſalom!—my Son!—my Son,
Abſalom!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>YOU ſee, Sir! how different this Great Monarch's Conduct, in ſo
nice, and trying, a Circumſtance, really was, from the Clouds, which <hi>Rumour</hi> blew upon it, to ſhade, and blacken, an <hi>unequal'd
Character!</hi>—The <hi>Roman Fierceneſs</hi> has been <hi>celebrated,</hi> in Men, who not only <hi>condemn'd</hi> their Sons; but
ſtood by, and <hi>ſaw</hi> 'em executed, in the moſt ſevere, 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0199100801:201"/> and ſhameful Manner, for the Love and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their
Country. Yet there was a <hi>Brutal Inflexibility,</hi> and a kind of <hi>Politic Neceſſity,</hi> in the Actions of thoſe <hi>Roman
Fathers!</hi> But this prodigious, <hi>modern,</hi> Prince, under no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Fear, Dependence, or Obligation, <hi>choſe,</hi> to ſet aſide his <hi>own Blood,</hi> for the future Glory of his <hi>People!</hi> Only, with
this fine Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from the <hi>Roman,</hi> that, what was, <hi>there,</hi>
done, with a <hi>Stoiciſm,</hi> that gave Suſpicion of Inſenſibility,
was, <hi>here,</hi> adorn'd with <hi>Pity,</hi> and the moſt manifeſt
Strugglings of an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> that convinc'd his Subjects how <hi>Dear</hi> their Proſperity muſt be, to a Sovereign, who cou'd thus
provide for it, by a Sacrifice, againſt his Nature, even of his private, and
domeſtick, Comfort!</p>
                  <p>HAVING ſhewn, in the foregoing Inſtances, the <hi>afflicted</hi>
Side of the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Behaviour: It is but juſt, that I ſhou'd change
the Light, and ſurprize you, by a View of that unſhaken <hi>Firmneſs,</hi> with which he regarded the <hi>Danger</hi> of the
Conſpiracy; while the Reflection, <hi>Who was the Author of it!</hi> gave him
ſo moving a <hi>Miſery!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>UPON the Examination, and Confeſſions, of that infinite Number
of Confederates, who were engag'd in the Prince's Projects, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, that
the Defection was ſo wide, and ſo general, that many of his neareſt, and
moſt truſted Servants, were embark'd in it; and ſuch alſo, in whoſe
Hands lay great Part of his Wealth and Power; ſo that he was congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0199100801:202"/> in Form, by the Ambaſſadors of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes,
upon his Diſcovery, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, of ſo endangering a Combination. To
which, he gave this noble Anſwer—<hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers always are ſtrong, if

            <p>WITH the Leave of the <hi>Grammarians,</hi> I ſhall venture to put
one of their <hi>Moods</hi> a little upon the Rack; while I affirm, in a kind
of Riddle, for the Uſe and Pleaſure of my Reader—That, tho' every
Body <hi>may</hi> be Happy, yet ſcarce any Body <hi>can</hi> be ſo.</p>
            <p>THERE is no Definite Point, that we can fix at, when we wou'd
deſcribe <hi>what Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is</hi>; yet the Road, to this great Journey's
End is very Short, and Obvious. One wou'd wonder therefore, how it comes to be
ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0199100801:203"/> miſtaken, if it were not eaſily
obſerv'd, that moſt Men are under an Error, even as to the very Placing
it.—<hi>Happineſs</hi> is ſeated, not in <hi>Power,</hi> but in <hi>Will.</hi>—Though very few can be <hi>Fortunate,</hi> yet all Men may
be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd:</hi> And they, who leſſen their Deſires, have, in one
great Point, the Advantage, over thoſe who enlarge their Proſperity; for,
allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to be equally Happy, yet the Firſt, at leaſt, are Happy,
with leſs Danger, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER can be ſo wiſe, as to content himſelf with his preſent
Lot, while he, patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hopes a better, will eſcape the common Fate, of
taſting, with Diſreliſh, what he finds within his Reach, from a
reſtleſs and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thirſt after what is Future, and
Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—Life ſlides from the Impatient, like the Motion of a
murmuring Brook; where the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent waſtes much faſter, than if the Surface
had been ſmooth, and ſilent.—When we are upon the Brink of the Grave,
we ſtart,—and wonder at our Situation! And, then, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to
look back, with Shame, and Sorrow, at the too Little we have <hi>Done,</hi> in
Life; and the too Much, we have <hi>wiſh'd,</hi> in it.</p>

<q rend="inline">'If a Perſon, (ſays the Speaker) is a Man of 
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0199100801:206"/> Wiſdom and Gravity, he wants no Rule but his Reaſon,
to preſcribe him a proper Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But, if a <hi>Fool</hi> were to ask me
the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I would tell him this Story.—The Moon, upon a Time, was
very earneſt with her Mother, that ſhe wou'd make her a new Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat,
that might ſit handſomely about her; and be neither too ſhort, nor too

            </p>
            <p>THERE is a reſtleſs and univerſal, Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Diſcontent,

they ſeldom fail to deceive us. The rough Lines, and Ruggedneſſes, which

future.—It is certainly an Ambition, not only <hi>juſt,</hi> but <hi>noble,</hi> to purſue the honeſt Calls, either of Fortune, or of Glory:
But, if we cou'd purſue 'em, with ſuch Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Moderation of
Deſire, as not to loſe, in the Interim, all Reliſh of our preſent
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; not to place our only Happineſs, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to become <hi>more</hi> happy; but content ourſelves with what we are, from the
Proſpect <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0199100801:208"/> of what we hope to be:—All the
Bitterneſs of Adverſity wou'd loſe its Taſte, in our Uſe of it; and
Proſperity become leſs envied, than Peace of Mind and Tranquillity.</p>
            <p>BUT this, however poſſible to Nature, is impoſſible to Pride
and Cuſtom—Things, indifferent, in themſelves, become hateful, or
amiable, from their Conſequences.—The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that follows Wealth,
gives the ſharpeſt Pain to Poverty: And a Man who is brave enough to
provoke Danger, and Death, ſhall want Courage to bear Contempt, though but an
imaginary Evil!</p>

               <hi>HATEMTAI,</hi> ſays the <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtory, was the
moſt bountiful, of all Mankind; and was flatter'd, by a Train of Followers,
with continual Flights of Praiſe, and Congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Good
Fortune.—They were ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him one Day, 
<q rend="inline">'Whether, ever, he had ſeen, or heard of, any Man,
who had ſo noble a Soul, as <hi>Hatemtai?</hi>—He ſmil'd, and
return'd this Anſwer:—I walk'd out into the Fields, on a certain Time,
when, at a Sacrifice of a Hundred Camels, my Houſe was fill'd, by my Order,
with all the Poor, and the Miſerable, who cou'd be found, in the Space of
many Miles round my Dwelling.—Some of the Lords in my Company,
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, at a little Diſtance, a Man, who was very buſy, in gathering
up a Bundle of dry Thorns, to ſell, at the next Village. We went to him and
ask'd, why he was not among the Number of his Fellows, who were 
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0199100801:209"/> feaſting at the Houſe of <hi>Hatemtai?—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>a Man, who can provide
himſelf with Bread, by his own Labour, needs not be oblig'd to</hi>
Hatemtai.—This Man, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> had a Nobler Soul, than <hi>Hatemtai.</hi>

            <p>I WALK'D, lately, into the City, toward the Cloſe of the Day, and
obſerving a Church open, went in, to Evening Prayers. I ſat near a Lady,
whoſe fine Face, methought, appear'd like the Seat of a long War, between <hi>Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Affliction.</hi> She ſaw, that I had no Prayer-Book,
and modeſtly offer'd me her own. I kept it, during the Service, and took
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to charge my Memory with the Eight following Lines, which were
written, in a Woman's Hand, on a white Leaf, at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and were, I
believe, of her own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>Here, tracing Duty's Path, redeem'd from Care,</l> 
               <l>I heal my Sorrow, with the Balm of Prayer:</l> 
               <l>Patience, that arms the Mind for every State,</l> 
               <l>Has taught me, not to feel Affliction's Weight.</l> 
               <l>They, who can, bravely, bear the Woes of Life,</l> 
               <l>Steer, ſafe and ſteady, through a Sea of Strife.</l> 
               <l>While they, who pine their Hope, to feed their Grief,</l> 
               <l>Emboſom Anguiſh; and reſiſt Relief.</l> 
            </q>
            <p>THIS was a fine, and uſeful Leſſon; and not improperly plac'd.
But it was pity that ſhe learnt is not ſoon enough to protect her againſt
thoſe Paſſions, which had left their Traces too viſibly on her Eyes,
her Air, and her Complexion.</p>

               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0199100801:210"/>THE World, upon the whole, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into
two Claſſes;—The one ſeldom Find, what they are, always, painfully
Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The other Find it, eaſily, but are never the more
Contented.—Among many Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proverbs, which are proper to the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People, they have one to our preſent Purpoſe.—

Envy.—The Men, to be ſure, cou'd never endure him, becauſe the Women

                  <p>I AM an honeſt Man, and keep a <hi>Coffee-Houſe</hi>; and pay
Two-Pence apiece for your <hi>Plain-Dealers.</hi> My Cuſtomers are ſo
pleas'd with them, that I take it for granted, they are worth the Money: But
what I think I have juſt Cauſe to complain of, is, that, when a Gentleman
calls for a Diſh of <hi>Coffee,</hi> and the <hi>Plain Dealer,</hi> if he
finds any thing in the Paper, that he is mightily taken with, he makes no
Scruple of convincing me, that <hi>he</hi> is as <hi>taking,</hi> as the
Paper;—that is to ſay, he puts it up, and carries it away with him, to
divert his Club, or his Miſtreſs.—So, he has Two-pence in Wit; and
Two-pence, in Liquor: Yet, pays me only for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor!—as if Wit were
worth Nothing!—I am ſerv'd thus, ſo often, that, though your Papers
come out, but twice a Week, I take 'em in, twice a Day; as my <hi>Account-Book</hi> can make appear, by very woeful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.—Now,
what I want you to ſay, <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0199100801:214"/> to theſe light-finger'd
Purchaſers, is, that a Man, who has no Hair, may as well lay Claim to my

                  <p>I diſcharged ſome random Shot, among the Wild-Fowl, at our
laſt Horſe-Races; but the only two I wounded, were a <hi>Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi> of
the Foot Guards; and a <hi>Canary-Bird,</hi> called a Templer.—The
Templer was a Wit; and, I ſpeak it, with a Sigh,—a charming
one!—He was vain, conſcious, chearful, and as falſe, as my own Smiles
were.—My Foot Officer was ſerious, honeſt, friendly: but I thought,
he was too Dull.—I receiv'd both their Addreſſes, but not with equal
Senſibility: The <hi>Soldier,</hi> I ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0199100801:215"/> but

bid farewel to <hi>Epſom,</hi> without taking Leave of me, to follow a Flirt

ſays, that his Dwelling ſhou'd be near his Duty; and where he may be under
the Eye of his Fellow Stateſmen.—I was the other Day at an odd
Chriſt'ning, in one of the Horns of this huge City, where, a newly preferr'd
Court Lady was complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to her Siſter Goſſips, How unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it
is, in Divided Times, for thoſe, who are diſtinguiſh'd by Court Favours,
to have the <hi>Diſaffected</hi> for their Enemies.—I whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper'd a
grave Gentlewoman, to know, what <hi>Poſt</hi> that great Lady held? And was
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, with becoming Seriouſneſs, that ſhe was marry'd to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Muſtard-maker.</hi>

quite a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Caſe, where Commiſſions are really uſeful: No good
Subject, for Example, can think much of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Pudding-maker,</hi> and a great deal might be ſaid, in Honour of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Punch-houſe.</hi>—The <hi>Royal

and ſomething like it may be offer'd, in Behalf of <hi>His Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>Butter-Woman.</hi>—But I wou'd be glad to be inform'd, what ſerious
Pretence can be urg'd, by any Man, who makes a Conſcience of his Arguments,

theſe are ſome of the luxuriant <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences</hi> of Monarchy; and
wou'd, in the watchful Times of our Forefathers, have been par'd away, for the

                     <salute>Dear SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM a Woman, who, by the Help of a little Reading, am, ſo far at
leaſt, more learned, than the Generality of my Sex, that a Hard Word does not
fright me. But my Husband is a Perſon, of great Goodneſs, and little
Knowledge. He has a ſmall Eſtate, in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and is only, what
they call a Sportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.—We came to Town, laſt Week; where my poor
Dear drank hard, and fell ſo ill, that I was alarm'd for him.—The Lady,
whoſe Houſe we lodg'd at, wou'd needs ſend for <hi>Doctor
Foſſile,</hi> who is, I find upon Enquiry, a Man of excellent Learning;
but, to borrow a Phraſe of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi>'s, it is <hi>ſicklied
over,</hi> with Affectation.—When he had felt my Husband's Pulſe, and
gone through his Courſe of Queſtions, he turn'd, from whiſpering Mr. <hi>Juniper,</hi> who was in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at his Elbow; and ſaid to me, with a
phyſical Air, not the Air of a Phyſician,—<hi>Maam</hi>!—I have
order'd <hi>Mr. What's his Name</hi> here, your Spouſe's Apothecary, to <hi>Phlebotomize</hi> him, to Morrow Morning.—<hi>To do what to me?</hi>
cry'd my poor Husband, <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0199100801:220"/> ſtarting up, in his
Bed—<hi>I will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuffer it—No,—I am not,
I thank God, in ſo deſperate a Condition, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſuch a damnable
Operation as that is.</hi>—As <hi>what is?</hi> my Dear,—anſwer'd
I, half ſmile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,—The Doctor wou'd only have you <hi>blooded.</hi>—Ay,—for <hi>bleeding,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>I like
it well enough.—But, for that other Thing he order'd, I will ſooner
die, than ſubmit to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW, Good Sir!—cannot ſuch a uſeful Maſs of Learning, as
diſtinguiſhes <hi>Doctor Foſſile,</hi> render him capable of
diſcerning, and correcting, this odd Weakneſs?—It expoſes him to
the Ridicule of malicious Perſons, who, hating a Merit, they deſpair of
ever equalling, are glad to depreciate his Character, by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Worſt
of his Particularity.—Since <hi>Ars eſt celare Artem,</hi> the Doctor
wou'd be thought more learn'd, if he leſs endeavour'd to diſplay his
Learning. I know, I have made a forc'd Application of my little <hi>Latin</hi>
Sentence; yet, it will do, well enough, too, in the Senſe that I have given
it.—I am,</p>

            <p>THE Writer of the <hi>Rehearſal,</hi> puts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mouth of Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> with regard to the <hi>Good</hi> to be <hi>extracted</hi> from <hi>Books,</hi> by the moſt <hi>indifferent</hi> Hands, a Truth, that might
have been ſpoken by a Perſon, whoſe Air of Gravity, was not (like that of
Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi>) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make him Ridiculous.</p>
            <p>HOW far was I from thinking Mr. <hi>Jyngle</hi> the moſt Eligible
Companion in the World, when I met him at Sir <hi>Portly</hi>'s? And yet this
very Mr. <hi>Jyngle,</hi> (for I will take heed how I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſo touchy a
Philologiſt, by miſ-ſpelling his Name any more, with a broad-back'd <hi>Gothick</hi> G, as he calls it) no ſooner became my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, but
he proved himſelf a Man of more than ordinary Parts, and one whoſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
are new and uncommon. I may liken him to ſome curious Engine, of great Uſe
to me in my Writing-Capacity; and very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0199100801:222"/> in
the Machinery of ſome Inventions which I ſhall make known in the Courſe
of theſe PAPERS, for the Benefit of thoſe, who have contracted an ill Habit
of Humour, and are ſickly in their Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>I EXPRESS myſelf, with much Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when I declare, as I
here do, that I know not one Science, ſo Advantageous in <hi>Theory,</hi> as
Mr. <hi>Jyngle</hi>'s New Syſtem of <hi>Mind Midwife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> If this lucky
Gentleman can but make it anſwer in <hi>Practice,</hi> according to the
vaſt Idea's I conceive of its Excellence and Uſe, he will be as much
ſuperior to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> as the Soul is to the Body. Now, <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as Sir <hi>Clouterly Rumble,</hi> in one of his <hi>Phyſical</hi> Treatiſes, informs us, was complimented with <hi>Divine</hi> Honours, juſt as his Predeceſſor <hi>Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius</hi>
had been erected to the Dignity of a <hi>Demi-God,</hi> from ſo <hi>low</hi>
a ſetting out, as that of a <hi>Tooth-drawer.</hi> As mean a Conception,
therefore, as I, or any of my <hi>Readers,</hi> might have, too haſtily,
entertained of Mr. <hi>Jyngle,</hi> as a mere Repeater of his own Rhimes, there
is now ample Room for forming great Idea's of his Abilities, and of the
Preferment, he may come to, ſince he is, the Inventor, and will, in all
Probability, be the Perfecter of this <hi>more noble Art of Healing.</hi> And
if, in the very Infancy of his Science, he makes a thorough Cure of his
deſperate Patient Sir <hi>Clouterly</hi>; I do verily think, after that,
there will not be the leaſt Room for any <hi>ſick minded</hi> Perſon
what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to deſpair of Succeſs under his <hi>Regimen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0199100801:223"/>HOWEVER, ſince a Perſon muſt be in a <hi>painful</hi> way indeed, before he <hi>cries out</hi> for the Phyſician,
I would propound a kind of <hi>Diet</hi> to thoſe who diſcover Symptoms of
any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Spiritual Malady, which will ſerve them by way of
Prevention. This Method is certainly preferable to the common way of Delaying
till the Diſeaſe is actually upon them, which is then in Danger of not
being removed, without Recourſe to violent Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. In Sir <hi>Clouterly</hi>'s Caſe, the Preſcription of Mr. <hi>Jyngle</hi> is ſo
very ungentle, that Fair Ladies, who find themſelves a going into any <hi>Immoral Habit,</hi> ſhould, one would think, take early Care to ſtop
the Progreſs of it, for fear of lying under the Neceſſity of ſuch
dreadful Emeticks. That, it ſeems, which the <hi>Titled</hi> Patient muſt
be forced to undergo, for the Cure of <hi>Vanity</hi> only, (and, what
Perſon, with a <hi>Title,</hi> thinks <hi>Vanity</hi> ſo <hi>great</hi> an <hi>Ill?</hi>) will, he confeſſes, be attended with ſuch violent
Workings, that it will make him <hi>vomit his Heart up.</hi> Now, who would not
avoid this rough Handling, by taking Things in Time, when they apprehend a
Diſorder to be riſing, and obſerving a regular <hi>Mind-Diet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL proceed, to lay down ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules, and ſhort
Recipes, by way of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen, that the Ladies, eſpecially, may encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a
Pocket Volume, which I intend ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to publiſh, on the Subject of <hi>Mind-Labours,</hi> and <hi>Deliveries,</hi> and which I only wiſh may be
diſperſed into as many Hands as <hi>Culpeper</hi>'s Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery; 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0199100801:224"/> for I am ſure I may ſay, without Boaſting, it will
be a more uſeful and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>PERSONS, who have any Conſideration for the Health of their Minds,
are deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect <hi>Seriouſly,</hi> that all <hi>Exceſſive
Paſſions</hi> are <hi>Diſtempers</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi>; and but <hi>Fore-runners</hi> of <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> in the <hi>Body.</hi> Let them
know, that nothing conduces more, to the Reſtraint of theſe <hi>Humours,</hi> (which grow peccant and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nicious, the very Moment they
become Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate,) than Exerciſe in the Thinking Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p>READING the Salutary Maxims of Wiſe Men, with Attention, digeſting
them by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and imprinting them on the Memory, by frequent
Recollection, is a <hi>Mind-Diet</hi> or <hi>Regimen,</hi> which will, in a
ſhort Time, reſtore Health to a decayed Conſtitution, and add incredible
Vigour, to a Weak and Languiſhing Underſtanding. Minds the beſt arm'd,
are not always Invulnerable: There are conſtantly ſome peeviſh Accidents,
ſome croſs and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſappointments, in the rugged Road of Life, to
throw a Cloud over the ſereneſt, and diſcompoſe the moſt equal
Tempers. But, there is not methinks, a quicker or ſweeter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy than to
ſtep to the Cloſet, and take down a <hi>moral Draught,</hi> which will
ſmooth us into the moſt perfect Calm. <hi>Gallus, Tibullus, Ovid,
Catullus,</hi> will afford us <hi>Lenitives</hi>; and <hi>Horace, Juvenal</hi>
and <hi>Perſius,</hi> will furniſh us with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives,</hi> ſo
that we may find a Cure for every <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0199100801:225"/> Diſtemper. There are
not any Infirmities, Pains, or Sufferings of the Mind, but what the Writings of
ſome of theſe Doctors contain proper <hi>Specificks</hi> for. The beſt of
this Method of preſcribing, is, that the Phyſick is eaſy and delightful.
For what does it conſiſt in but Exerciſing one's Wits with ſome of the
beſt Company in the World, whom even Ladies cannot go to for Diverſion,
without finding them at the ſame Time uſeful, or viſit for
Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without finding them agreeable. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Congreve,</hi>
&amp;c. Have made them refined <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and our <hi>Modern</hi>
Beauties have the ſame Advantages in their <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Ladies had in the <hi>Originals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHY ſhould it not be the Care of profeſs'd <hi>Viſiters,</hi>
not to contract ill Habits which are always very catching, and fill the Mind,
with Spots and Blemiſhes? a Toaſt that never had the Small-Pox, would be in
a Pannick, at the Appearance of a Face newly mark'd; and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who break
out with Detraction, have the Small-Pox of the Mind, and are frightful when the
Marks are upon them.</p>
            <p>YOU ſhall ſee a Young Creature torture her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into Beauty
puniſh herſelf to pleaſe her Lover, and skin her Face for a Complexion;
And yet, tho' ſhe knows ſhe is a little Vixen in her Nature, ſhe ſhall
not ſo much as once, after ſhe is married to him, endeavour to learn, how
ſhe may avoid the praeternatural <hi>Paleneſſes</hi> and <hi>Fluſhings,</hi> which Anger excites in a Beautiful Countenance, giving
the whole Form of it ſuch <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0199100801:226"/> a contrary Caſt, that it
is enough to terrify all Beholders. Whenever any of theſe blooming Buſtlers
begin to bluſter, the Husband may be the Phyſician; for, when the fiery
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles within them betray any of the <hi>Soft</hi> Things to an unbecoming
Fit of <hi>Rage,</hi> the Sight of a Looking-Glaſs, at that Critical Minute
of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, has been preſcribed by our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers with admirable, and
neverfailing Effect. But this is only a tranſitory Cure, and does not go to
the Root of the Diſeaſe. There are Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages relating to the Effects of <hi>Anger</hi> in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried State, that would place their <hi>Inſide</hi> as
clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before them. A Lady, whom this Practice would not work into
Gentleneſs of Temper, could never be cured of ſo violent an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
but by one of Mr. <hi>Jyngle</hi>'s ſevereſt Operations.</p>
            <p>IS a Lady jealous? And will ſhe not have Senſe enough, to bluſh
at the Follies of Jealouſy, when ſhe is reading them, in private, and
ſave herſelf from the Inconveniency of looking frightful, in publick
Company? She ſtands highly in need of Mr. <hi>Jyngle.</hi> Who, that could
not <hi>read</hi> away a <hi>Fit</hi> of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> in that Excellent <hi>Modern</hi> Poem, the <hi>Rape of the Lock,</hi> could be otherwiſe than
given over, as quite loſt, Unleſs Mr. <hi>Jyngle</hi> appear'd, to carry it
off, by his new Invention? Thoſe Ladies, who have <hi>Wit</hi> enough to
plead their being of the <hi>Unfortify'd</hi> Sex in ſo <hi>artful</hi> a
Manner, 
<q>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0199100801:227"/>

Inventions, till they <hi>hurt</hi> their <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Quiet</hi>;

            <p>THE Loſs of Friends is a Miſery, which, more than any other, puts

to be reſiſted. All the Looks, Words, and Actions, of thoſe, who were

have Recourſe to, for ſome Mitigation of our Sorrow: Whereas their <hi>Vertues,</hi> their <hi>Endearments,</hi> and the <hi>Good Offices</hi>
they have done us, are like <hi>Tortures</hi> to the <hi>Imagination</hi>; and
the moſt painful <hi>Enflamers</hi> of our <hi>Miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0199100801:229"/>BUT the Tenderneſs of the <hi>Lovelier
Sex</hi> maintains a generous Superiority, over ours, in the Warmth, and
Softneſs, of their Sorrow. There is a Sweetneſs, in a Mother's Grief, when
ſhe drowns her <hi>Charms</hi> in <hi>Tears,</hi> that raiſes <hi>Beauty</hi> into <hi>Majeſty</hi>; and mixes Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with our
Fondneſs for her. It is her <hi>Soul,</hi> we are, then, enamour'd of! And
the <hi>Husband, Son,</hi> or <hi>Father,</hi> of ſuch a Mourner,
conſiders, with an inward Triumph, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, he is proud to hold, in a
Heart, ſo grac'd by Pity; and ſo ſincerely Sweet and Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>THE Force of Natural Affection has its ſtrongeſt Effect, in <hi>Mothers</hi> from the great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there is, for that long Care,
and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which are the Supports of the Human Species, during the Wants,
and Helpleſſneſs of Infancy: And the moſt unreaſonable Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities,
of fond <hi>Mothers,</hi> to their Children, are not only Pardonable, but
Beautiful, when we conſider, what good Effects are owing to the Influence of
this charming Weakneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SHAKESPEARE</hi>'s Tragedy, of <hi>King John,</hi> has, I hear,
been lately alter'd, with Deſign to bring it on the Stage next Winter. I
doubt not, but the Alterer has been careful not to rob us of the Grief of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> for the Loſs of her Son <hi>Arthur,</hi> when in the
Hands of the King, who deſigns to murder him.—Being told, that ſhe is <hi>Mad,</hi> not <hi>Sorrowful,</hi> ſhe replies, 
<q>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0199100801:230"/> 
                  <l>I am not mad, Oh! wou'd to Heaven I were!</l> 
                  <l>If I were mad, I ſhou'd <hi>forget</hi> my <hi>Son.</hi>
                  </l> 
                  <l>— I have heard 'em ſay,</l> 
                  <l>That we ſhall meet, and know our Friends, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</l> 
                  <l>If ſo, I, yet, may ſee my Boy again.</l> 
                  <l>—But Sorrow's <hi>Canker</hi> will have <hi>eat</hi> his
Bloom;</l> 
                  <l>'Till he looks Pale, and Meagre, as a Ghoſt:</l> 
                  <l>And dies, ſo chang'd, that, when, in Heaven, we meet,</l> 
                  <l>I fear, I ſhall not know him!</l> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Thought, of her Son's Sorrow, and his becoming ſo alter'd by
it, as not to be known, if ſhe ſhou'd meet him, in Heaven, has ſo natural
a Mixture in it, of the <hi>Tender</hi> and the <hi>Wild</hi>! Something ſo
exquiſitely adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both to her Character, and her Condition, that I have
always conſider'd it, as one of the livelieſt Strokes in the Tragedy: Tho'
it is finely ſupported, by what follows.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>
                  <hi>Grief</hi> fills the Place up, of my abſent Son,</l>

               <l>Puts on his pretty Looks; repeats his Words;</l> 
               <l>Swells out his vacant Garments with his Form.</l> 
               <l>—But <hi>Memory</hi> ſmarts to miſs him!</l> 
            </q>
            <p>HOW much eaſier, and leſs lovely, wou'd this <hi>Conſtance</hi>
have appear'd, under the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Son's Loſs, had ſhe regarded
him with the cold Indifference of a Modern <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; whom I am glad,

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE the Pleaſure of a very intimate Acquaintance with that
unhappy young Gentleman, whoſe Verſes to a Painter, you printed in one of
your PLAIN DEALERS; with a generous Remark, or two, on the Merit of the poor
Gentleman, himſelf, and the uncommon Cruelty of his <hi>Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>PERHAPS few Things cou'd be more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, than a Hiſtory of
his Birth and Uſage!—Of two Fathers, whom he might have claim'd, and <hi>both</hi> of them <hi>Noble,</hi> he loſt the <hi>Title,</hi> of the one,
and a <hi>Proviſion</hi> from the other's Pity, by the Means alone of this <hi>Mother!</hi> who, as if ſhe had reſolv'd, not to leave him a ſingle
Comfort, afterwards robb'd him of <hi>herſelf</hi> too! and, in direct
Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Impulſe of her Natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, upon miſtaken
Motives of a falſe Delicacy, ſhut her Memory againſt his Wants, and
caſt him out to the ſevereſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; without allowing herſelf to
contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute even ſuch ſmall Aid, as might at leaſt, have preſerv'd him
from Anguiſh; and pointed out ſome Path to his future In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</p>
                  <p>BUT I forbear to be too particular, on any of theſe Heads,
becauſe I know it wou'd give him Pain, for whoſe ſake only I remember
them: For while Nature acts ſo weakly, on the Humanity of the Parent, ſhe
ſeems, on the Son's ſide, to have doubled her <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0199100801:232"/>
uſual Influence. Even the moſt ſhocking Perſonal Repulſes, and a
Series of Contempt and Injuries, received, at her Hands, through the whole
Courſe of his Life, have not been able to eraze, from his Heart, the
Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his filial Duty: Nor, which is much more ſtrange! of his
Affection. I have known him walk, three or four times, in a dark Evening,
through the Street this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> lives in, only for the Melancholy
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of looking up, at her Windows, in Hopes to catch a Moment's Sight
of her, as ſhe might croſs the Room by Candle Light.</p>
                  <p>HIS good Qualities, which are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, ought the more to be
eſteem'd and cheriſh'd becauſe he owes them to himſelf only: And,
without the Advantage of Friends, Fortune, or Education, wants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Knowledge nor Politeneſs, to deſerve a <hi>Mother</hi>'s Bleſſing, and
adorn, rather than diſgrace her.—I am ſtrongly perſuaded, from the
Character, which, upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he has taken Pleaſure to give me of
the Lady's Humanity, with regard to the reſt of the World, that nothing but
her hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much too long, already been a Stranger to ſuch a Son, cou'd make
her ſatisfy'd to continue ſo.—It is impoſſible, at leaſt, that
ſhe ſhou'd not diſtinguiſh him, by ſome kind Notice; ſome little
Mark of her returning Tenderneſs; if, without Regard to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhe
knew but his Manner of thinking of her: Which is, itſelf, a ſhining Merit!
and <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0199100801:233"/> a ſurprizing Inſtance of Generoſity! if
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd againſt thoſe Reaſons, which might excuſe a different
Treatment of her.</p>
                  <p>He writ the following Copy of Verſes, and ſeveral other, on the
ſame Subject, at a Time, when I know not which was moſt to be wonder'd
at;—That he ſhou'd be ſerene enough, for <hi>Poetry,</hi> under, the
Extremity of Ill-Fortune!—Or, that his <hi>Subject</hi> ſhou'd be the
Praiſe of her, to whom he ow'd a Life of Miſery!</p>

                  <p>THEY, who are depriv'd, by Death, of their deareſt Friends, and
Relations, are left wretched, in the Want of them; But they have this Comfort,
however,—that, before thoſe Deaths, they were happier:—Whereas

Sufferer, whoſe Merit, and the Wrongs he has ſuſtain'd, from his Parent's
Cruelty, entitle him to the Hope, of finding better Parents, among Strangers!
to the open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and Diſhonour of a <hi>Mother,</hi> who, ſince ſhe

            <p>I AM ſorry, that, in a Nation, juſtly famous for Good-Nature, we
have ſo ſtrong an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> as may be taken from this Letter.
But I will forbear, with my Correſpondent's Leave, to addreſs any
Arguments, to the <hi>Lady:</hi> Since, if ſhe is not harden'd, beyond
Nature, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Sorrow, and the Sufferings, expreſs'd, in her Son's
Sentiments, will melt her Heart into Pity for him; and move her, more
effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, than any Thing, that can be, morally, offer'd to her.</p>
            <p>I WILL turn my Advice, therefore, to the Service of thoſe Sons and
Daughters, who are neglected, and made unhappy, by the Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or
Partiality, of the Parent they depend on. A Caſe, too common, in moſt
Families! and which ſtands in need of all the Comfort, that can be pour'd
upon their Affliction.</p>
            <p>IT is a very melancholy Circumſtance when this happens, as it often
does, to the fineſt ſpirited Child, of the whole Number. But it ſhou'd be
Ground enough for Conſolation, that ſuch Sufferers owe the wrong
Poſition, they appear in, to a Weakneſs in the Parents Reaſon: A kind of
Deception, in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's <hi>Sight!</hi> As, when we ſee our Shadows, 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0199100801:236"/> in the Water, our Heads ſeem to hang down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and
our loweſt Parts are preferr'd, to look, unnaturally, uppermoſt.</p>
            <p>TIME will, certainly, bring a Remedy, to thoſe, who bear this Trial,
with Temperance: For Submiſſion diſarms the Rancour, that wou'd gather
Strength, from Exerciſe, by an imprudent Oppoſition. None, whoſe Injuries
are receiv'd, with Mildneſs, and return'd by Acts of Affection, can be, long,
without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering, and repenting, their Ingratitude. Whereas, by
permitting ourſelves to <hi>revenge</hi> the Wrongs we ſuffer, we furniſh
our Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors with an Appearance of Juſtice; and only make them more
blind, when 'tis our Intereſt, that they ſhou'd ſee clearly.</p>
            <p>IMPATIENCE under this, or any other, Affliction, does but double our
Mortification. How languid wou'd Life be, to the largeſt Part of the World,
if Expectation did not quicken it! <hi>Hope</hi> is the ſweeteſt, of all
Companions!—If it leads us not to the Road, which we are moſt inclin'd
to travel in, its Converſation, however, is ſo entertaining, and agreeable,
that we can never tire, in the Journey.</p>
            <p>WHEN a wicked Man is happy, he ſeems unworthy of his Happineſs:
But, where Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is unfortunate, it looks the larger, for the Clouds we ſee
it through.—There is a Courage, in Adverſity, that can put Fortune out
of Countenance.—Men are not deſpicable, by their Fate, but, by their
Manner of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. The Lyon has more Majeſty, in his 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0199100801:237"/> Chains, than when in the Foreſt: His Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is
reduc'd, and ſoften'd, by the Reſtraint of his Condition, and, what was <hi>terrible,</hi> in him, before, becomes <hi>venerable,</hi> by his
Calamity.</p>
            <p>BUT, we ſhou'd not only bear our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, with <hi>Patience</hi>; we ſhou'd ſuſtain 'em, too, with <hi>Silence.</hi>—Complaints are <hi>weak</hi> Mens Weapons: And, there
was ſomething, delicate, and finely judg'd, in the Conduct of a <hi>Perſian</hi> Merchant, I have read of, who, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the
Brink of Ruin, by a Race of Loſſes, that befel him, gave ſtrict Orders,
to his Son, that he ſhou'd ſpeak of it to Nobody. For, otherwiſe, ſaid
he, of <hi>One</hi> Misfortune, we ſhall make <hi>Two—The Loſs,
itſelf, which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of;—and our Enemy's rejoicing at
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, as the moſt perfect Pleaſures in the World are always mix'd
with Afflictions, ſo the ſharpeſt Afflictions have their Uſes, and
their Pleaſures.—A Man's beſt Friend, is his <hi>Enemy!</hi> Since by
mortifying his Vanity, he adorns his Nature with Humility; and teaches him to
ſhun the Practice of thoſe Ill Qualities, toward Others, which he finds
ſo unjuſt, and hateful, while he himſelf is oppreſs'd by them.</p>
            <p>BUT, while I talk of Humility, I bluſh, at my own Pride, who wou'd
teach others a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which I am myſelf, but a Learner in.—My
Reader, in this Caſe, muſt be ſo good as to compare me to a Blind Man,
with a Torch in his Hand—Though I ſee not my own Way, I carry Light
enough along with me, to guide the Steps of thoſe who follow me.</p>

                  <p>THE good Company, at Sir <hi>Portly</hi>'s, are at a ſad Loſs,
in your Abſence. Mr. <hi>Tireſome,</hi> and our Friend <hi>Tony,</hi> won't
drink one another's Healths yet. But Mr. <hi>Juniper</hi> has done as ſtrange
a Cure, upon Mr. <hi>Jyngle,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Jyngle</hi> himſelf intends to
do, upon Sir <hi>Clouterly Rumble.</hi>—<hi>Tony</hi> has never been
right, as he ſhou'd be, ſince you made him ſo aſham'd of ſhooting his
Poetry, at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He look'd very pale, Yeſterday, and complain'd of a Pain
in his Stomach. There was ſomething, he ſaid, lay, like a Load, at his
Heart: and he had much ado to draw his Breath, for it.—Mr. <hi>Juniper</hi> felt his Pulſe, and ſaid, he hop'd there was no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
Asking him, at the ſame Time, If he had made no <hi>Verſes,</hi> for this
Week paſt? Mr. <hi>Jyngle</hi> told him, <hi>Yes</hi>—and repeated
ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Lines, of a Poem, he has made a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in. The Verſes, I
muſt needs ſay, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as fine, as ever I heard any! But, what I
thought ſtrange, was, that, as ſoon as he had done Repeating, Mr. <hi>Juniper</hi> bid him <hi>hem</hi>—and go, chearfully, about his
Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for his Oppreſſion, he ſaid, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd.—And it
really prov'd, as he ſaid.—Mr. <hi>Jyngle</hi>'s Colour return'd
immediately; and he breathes, as freely as ever he did!</p>
                  <p>BUT, I fancy, for all this, he is not quite cur'd, yet. His
Diſtemper, I doubt, works inward: and, unleſs it has conſtant <hi>Vent,</hi> 
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0199100801:240"/> may blow up, into his Brain, and do more
Miſchief, than we are aware of. For I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, though he <hi>ſays</hi>
nothing, the ſuppreſs'd Spring of his Fancy twitches his Eyebrows, up and
down, and moves his Lips, like a Rabbit's!—He has got an odd Whim,
too,—the Effect, to be ſure, of his Melancholy! Of untying the Knots of
People's Periwigs, who happen to ſit within Reach of him! He will do the
ſame, by the Ladies Apron-Strings; and has made an Attempt or two, at their
Garters! Yet, is muſing, all the while, without meaning any Harm in
it.—Pray ſend me Word, by <hi>Humphry,</hi> who rides old <hi>Robin</hi> to Town, on purpoſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you don't think, this untying
Wigs, and Apron-Strings, an untowardly Symptom, in poor Mr. <hi>Jyngle?</hi>—Methinks, I wou'dn't, for a great deal, that his Brain
ſhou'd have any Thing in it.—Pray a Word, of your Advice, to, Deareſt

remarkable, for his good Preaching, I found the manifeſt Neceſſity we are
under, of a PLAIN-DEALER: Since moſt of our well-bred Enormities, which were
ſuppreſs'd during the Reign of your great Predeceſſor, Venerable <hi>Spec,</hi> of Immortal Memory, are crept again, into
Practice.—Lay-Pariſhioners, for Example, repeat the <hi>Abſolution,</hi> with as <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0199100801:242"/> much Loudneſs, and
Aſſurance, as if they were, all, in <hi>Prieſt's Orders!</hi> They

in the ſimple Worſhip of our Forefathers, are, now, moſt muſically, <hi>warbled,</hi> by gay, powder'd, Choriſters, who have their Ears refin'd,

eſtabliſh'd, I went a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Times, to his Houſe, with no other
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, than to read over the PLAIN-DEALER: But the Anſwer, I always had,

ſo often ask'd for it, that he was aſham'd to be longer without it; and I

                  <p>I MY own ſelf am a <hi>Barber,</hi> by Trade, but my Wife takes in <hi>Plain-work.</hi> I cou'd never endure to be Idle; and, therefore, when we

End, with theſe Words writ upon it, in Great Letters, <hi>SHAVE FOR A

preſently, we heard a jolly Voice, in the Street, <hi>Come, let us go

became eſtabliſh'd: For, that nothing is more falſe, in Fact, may be

            <p>THOUGH <hi>ten Engliſhmen,</hi> in <hi>twelve,</hi> are the
Deſcendants of <hi>Foreigners,</hi> and the very Name itſelf, of <hi>England,</hi> is <hi>Foreign:</hi> Yet, the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Foreigner</hi>
has been, always, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, diſtaſtful to us!</p>
            <p>INNOVATIONS were ever odious to us; and we choſe rather to <hi>neglect</hi> Advantages, than to try an untrodden Path, for 'em.—What
loſt <hi>England</hi> the firſt Poſſeſſion of that Gold and Silver
World in the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies,</hi> but her Diſpoſition to
diſcredit <hi>Novelty?</hi>—Our very <hi>Laws</hi> depend on <hi>Precedent:</hi>—And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, even of Rights, in Parliament, is
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported upon what <hi>has been</hi>; and ſeems uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd 
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0199100801:249"/> in <hi>why it was.</hi> Thoſe ſcandalous
Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which are ſo obſtinately given, to the Cleareſt Bills,
for Publick Benefit, ſuch, as <hi>making our Rivers Navigable,—Putting
our Lands under a Regiſter,—Promoting untry'd Trades,</hi>—And <hi>Eſtabliſhing National Fiſheries:</hi> Are, all, convincing
Inſtances, that no Nation, under Heaven, have ſo fix'd an Averſion to <hi>Novelty</hi>; which, yet, every Body is imputing to us, as the Reigning
Humour of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>BUT we have a Preſent Example, that will confirm my Remark, and for
ever put to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence thoſe, who accuſe us of the Love of Novelty. I mean,
the new Practice, of <hi>Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating the Small-Pox,</hi> on Bodies,
purpoſely, prepar'd to receive it: So, to prevent the uſual Danger, and
Malignancy, of that Diſtemper; and ſuſtain it, without the Terror, the
Fatali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Sorrow, which have heretofore, gone along with it.</p>
            <p>IT was a generous Undertaking, in that Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-ſpirited Member of
the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> who, reſolving, by <hi>clear Matter of Fact,</hi>
to eſtabliſh or explode, this Practice, has, with an unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Application, and the moſt ſtedfaſt Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, inform'd himſelf of
its Succeſs, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Parts of the Kingdom; and given the World an
Account of it, in his Pamphlet, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſh'd. A Treatiſe! which
deſerves the Eye, and moſt careful Conſideration, of every Parent, who
has <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or who wou'd ſave a Favourite Child, the promis'd
Comfort of <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0199100801:250"/> his Life! from being ſnatch'd away, perhaps
in its Bloom, by the Sweep of this Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>IT is demonſtrated, in the mention'd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, from a Forty
Year's Examination of the Bills of Mortality, 
<q rend="inline">'That the Small-Pox car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries off, at leaſt, <hi>one</hi> in every <hi>ſix,</hi> of all whom it ſeizes in the <hi>natural</hi> Way; whereas not one in <hi>fifty,</hi> (ſcarce one in many <hi>hundreds</hi>) of thoſe who receive it by <hi>Inoculation,</hi> have been
found to die under it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE whole Number of Perſons, who have been ſo much as
ſuſpected to owe their Deaths to it, ever ſince its firſt Introduction,
in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> amounts to <hi>Nine,</hi> only!—They are, all
nam'd, in the Printed Account; and there is ſcarce one among them, for
whoſe Death a Clearer Cauſe, than the Inoculation, is not aſſign'd, and
atteſted, by the very Phyſicians, and Surgeons, who directed the
Operation—So that Providence ſeems to have guided, and enlighten'd, <hi>Art,</hi> in this Practice, to aſſiſt, and relieve, <hi>Nature,</hi>
for the Preſervation of the Human Species.</p>
            <p>YET, with what Violence, and Malice, has it not been rail'd at, and
oppos'd?—How many Falſe Affirmations have we ſeen, with unbluſhing
Boldneſs, inſulting Truth, in our Publick News-Papers!—Nay, the
Pulpits, too, have trembled, under the Zeal of <hi>Reverend Railers</hi>; who,
in the holy Blindneſs of their Paſſion, have ſhewn us <hi>Job,</hi>
upon his Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; <hi>inoculated,</hi> for the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> by the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> of a Surgeon!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0199100801:251"/>IT has been repreſented, as a <hi>Wilful
Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der!</hi> A new, and wicked, Preſumption! An Aſſault on the
Prerogative of Heaven! And a taking <hi>God's own</hi> Work out of his Hands,
to be mended by <hi>Man's</hi> Arrogance!</p>
            <p>BUT the Common Arguments, however deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable, give me Diverſion,
and Entertainment.—When I hear a pious Old Woman wiſely
wondering,—<hi>What this World would come to!</hi> and concluding her
Remarks with this great Maxim of Reſignation, that <hi>God's own Time is
beſt!</hi> I compare this Force of Female Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, to the
Repreſentation which, a late Writer tells us, The old <hi>Boyars,</hi> or
Grandees of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> gravely made, to the Preſent <hi>Czar,</hi>
when he attempted a Communication, by Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Canal, between the <hi>Volga,</hi> and the <hi>Tanais.</hi>—
<q rend="inline">"<hi>The Deſign,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>was
Great;</hi>—But they humbly conceiv'd it <hi>Impious:</hi>—For, <hi>ſince God had made the Rivers to run one Way, Man ought not to turn them
Another.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is an eſtabliſh'd Rule, amongſt Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, That <hi>Loſers ſhou'd have leave to ſpeak:</hi> And, for this Reaſon, I
rather pity, than grow angry with an unmarried Prude or Coquet, when I catch
'em Railing at Inoculation, with a Thouſand <hi>Excuſes</hi> for it, in
their <hi>Faces.</hi>—As it is a Comfort to the Miſerable to have
Companions in their Miſery, ſo, it muſt be a Provocation, to theſe Fair <hi>Invalids,</hi> to hear of a Preſervative, for other's Beauty, when it is
too late, to ſave their own by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0199100801:252"/>YET, theſe good Ladies, unmindful that they
carry about with them, the Cauſe of their own Peeviſhneſs, treat an
innocent Practice, when they join the <hi>Chorus</hi> of <hi>Railers,</hi> as
the <hi>Indian</hi> did the Looking-Glaſs, which he found on the
Sea-Side.—He was frightfully Ugly; and, ſtarting back from his own
Image, threw away the Glaſs, in great Rage, with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Obſervation:—<hi>I might have gueſs'd, thou wert good for nothing:
Thou would'ſt not have been left here elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is the Obſervation of ſome Hiſtorian; but I forgot where I
met with it: That <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land has ow'd to Women the greateſt Bleſſings

this Reflection will ſtand juſtified.—We are indebted to the
Reaſon, and the Courage of a <hi>Lady,</hi> for the Introduction of this Art;
which gains ſuch Strength in its Progreſs, that the Memory of its
Illuſtrious Foundreſs will be render'd Sacred, by it, to future Ages.</p>

            <p>A Journey into <hi>Greece</hi> being the Subject of theſe Verſes, <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> lay a little too direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Way.—I ſhou'd,
elſe, have been out of Humour, that the Force of the Author's Fancy took its <hi>Turn</hi> from the <hi>Pagan Syſtem:</hi> and does <hi>Apollo</hi> as
much Honour, as the <hi>Lady,</hi> who is worth a Thouſand of him. But, it is
an uncommon Misfortune, to her Genius, 
<q rend="inline">"That the only Thing in the World, worth knowing, and
not known, to <hi>her,</hi> is, <hi>her own prodigious
Excellence.</hi>
               </q>—So, ſhe is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able, nor willing, to
deſcribe it, herſelf; and no Verſe, but her own, can ſoar high enough,
for her Merit.—The <hi>ſweeteſt</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh Poets</hi>
has endeavour'd it with leſs Succeſs, than attended any of his other
Compoſitions: And, if a <hi>Nameleſs one</hi> has miſs'd it, after him,
he has, at leaſt, this Conſolation, 
<q rend="inline">"That he miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0199100801:255"/> in
ſuch Company, as it is a kind of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to go aſtray with.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I WOU'D not, however, be miſtaken, in this Cenſure.—The
Verſes, I mean, abound with <hi>Wit.</hi>—They have only an Air of
wanton Levity, that looks too merry, to be enough in Earneſt, and gives the
Turn of a <hi>ſmiling Satire.</hi>—Praiſe ought always to be <hi>ſerious,</hi> when it is addreſs'd to the <hi>Perſon prais'd,</hi>
and where the <hi>Subject</hi> is of Weight, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>THERE is, I know, a <hi>pert</hi> Species of <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick,</hi>
which has been admir'd, in the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Balzac, Voiture,</hi> and other <hi>French</hi> Writers; who, when they wou'd praiſe <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Heroes,</hi> took 'em, ironically, to <hi>Task:</hi> and <hi>chid</hi> 'em,
by way of <hi>Commendation.</hi>—But, to ſpeak like a PLAIN DEALER,
ſuch familiar, and ſmart <hi>Encomiums</hi> imply ſomething like a
Senſe of ſuperior Qualities, in the over-conſcious Beſtowers of
'em.—Some of the Verſes, juſt now hinted at, have a little too much
of the <hi>Sportive</hi>; but nothing of the <hi>French Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</hi>

            <p>THIS is exquiſite, and lively, <hi>Wit!</hi> But it is Wit of too <hi>brisk</hi> a Species, for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is applied to.—If a <hi>Barriſter</hi> ſhou'd take a Fancy to <hi>dance</hi> in his <hi>Pleading,</hi> wou'd the Judge admit his <hi>Skill,</hi> in Excuſe of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decorum?</hi>—This Praiſe, ſo gayly given, wou'd have
ſurpriz'd, like a Flaſh of Lightning; where, inſtead of being the <hi>profeſs'd Subject,</hi> it had been ſtruck out, <hi>unexpectedly.</hi>—As it is, it looks like Trifling; and

look'd a little ſilly, at firſt, and tumbled off, when they cry'd, <hi>Jump, for the King</hi>; and cou'dn't keep ſteady, for the Life of

                     <salute>Honourable SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>OBSERVING by ſome of your <hi>Plain-Dealers,</hi> that you are a
great Admirer of the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> I humbly preſume to
acquaint you, that I am, lately, come out of his Country; and have brought with
me a Commodity, call'd a <hi>Ruſſian Bear.</hi>—He has ſhar'd very
largely, in the Improvements of his Fellow Subjects; for, he can fiddle, as
well as any Body; he ſits bolt up on End, and holds his <hi>Kit</hi> in one
Paw, with the Butt End againſt his Belly; and, with his Fiddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick in the
other Paw, <hi>tunes it away,</hi> after the <hi>Italian</hi> Manner, with his
Head o' one ſide, all in Raptures, at his own Harmony!—It wou'd do your
Heart good, to look at him, when he is ſplitting a Note into <hi>Graces:</hi>
For he ſhakes his Noſe, and his Paw, together, with ſuch a Variety of
melodious <hi>Quavering,</hi> that his <hi>Ear</hi> muſt be confeſs'd as <hi>delicate,</hi> as if he had been a <hi>Subſcriber</hi> to the <hi>Opera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT, there is one Thing, that I take to be a very particular
Happineſs to him! He looks, when he is Grave, for all the World, like that
Ingenious <hi>Swiſs</hi> Gentleman, that has ſo many diverting Fancies, to
get Money, by making Ladies, and Gentlemen, merry together. If they were to be
dreſs'd both alike, I am confident there wou'd be no knowing 'em aſunder.
May be, that may go a great Way, toward making the poor Thing's
Fortune.—I have him, here in <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0199100801:261"/> Town, but he is out
of Buſineſs, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſo, if you cou'd but be ſo kind as to put
him in ſome Way of Preferment, he ſhall wait on you, where you pleaſe;
and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you with a <hi>Sample Leſſon:</hi> Which is all, that
offers, at this Time from, Honourable SIR,</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>Yours to Command, <hi>JONAS

            <p>I TACK this extraordinary Pair of <hi>Epiſtles</hi> together,
becauſe of a manifeſt Reſemblance in their Contents; and, for that I am
deſirous to promote a <hi>Union</hi> between Mrs. <hi>Softly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Queer.</hi>—Their <hi>Beaſts,</hi> at leaſt, if not themſelves,
muſt be ſubſcribed into a <hi>Joint-Stock,</hi> for the better carrying
on of their Trade.—They may afterwards debate, at Leiſure, concerning
the <hi>Incorporation</hi> of their <hi>Perſons.</hi> But, certain it is,
that two Animal Artiſts, of ſuch Sagacity, as both the <hi>African,</hi>
and the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Stranger, cou'd never have honour'd <hi>London</hi> with their Reſidence, at a properer Time than this: Or, with
a fairer Promiſe, for their own Benefit.</p>
            <p>SOME <hi>Stateſmen,</hi> who look <hi>deep</hi> into Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Conſequences; and diſcern at a Diſtance, the Fate of <hi>Mightineſs,</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to foreſee
the ſudden Downfall of <hi>Opera</hi>!—Who knows, if ſuch a
melancholy Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhou'd befall the Polite World; but theſe two,
qualify'd, Performers, may take Poſſeſſion <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0199100801:262"/> of
that deſerted Theatre; and, under the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpices of ſo noble, and ſo
unanimous, a Board of Directors, out-do, even the ſurprizing Things, which
have already been heard, and ſeen, there!</p>
            <p>OR, ſuppoſe, it were, <hi>yet, a Winter,</hi> before the <hi>Haymarket</hi> will be in a Condition to receive them: They cannot fail, in
the mean Time, to meet with more than reaſonable Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they but
apply themſelves to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers, of either of our Theatres: In one, of
which, they labour under ſuch a want of good Actors, that two ſuch
accompliſh'd Comedians (having the Advantage, too, of being <hi>foreign</hi>
Ones!) may, certainly, make their own Terms, if they are inclinable to <hi>ſtrengthen the Youngeſt Company:</hi> Or, if Fortune, againſt her
uſual Cuſtom, moſt propitious to her old Favourites, ſhou'd diſpoſe
their Choice another Way; they may be entertain'd, as <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>Allies,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foot of well-paid Subſidies; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
Officers, of thoſe <hi>Veterans,</hi> entering, lately, with much Vivacity
upon New Plans of Action, which fall, immediately, within the Genius of our
fourfooted <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>HAVING barely touch'd this Hint for the Service of my
Correſpondents, who are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of great Parts and Induſtry; I come now
to ſay a Word or two, in my own Perſon, to the Stages.</p>
            <p>MUCH of the Summer is, yet, before us; and <hi>Winter,</hi> being the
Seaſon of our Theatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Campaigning, I ſhall prepare myſelf againſt 
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0199100801:263"/> that Time, to take the Field, at their firſt Marching:
and move, with one, or other of the Bodies, during the whole Courſe of their
Operations. My Readers may then, expect to be entertain'd, from my private
Journal, with the Good, or Bad, Diſcipline, of both Armies: and the
Perſonal Conduct of their Generals, in the Exerciſes, Evolutions, Sallies,
Stratagems, or Engagements, they ſhall, at any Time be concern'd
in.—Let 'em therefore ſtand <hi>warn'd:</hi> and aſſure
themſelves, that I ſhall animadvert on their Behaviour, with a Frankneſs,
they have been little us'd to; and lay 'em Open, like a PLAIN DEALER.</p>
            <p>BUT, to enter on another Subject, I have receiv'd ſeveral Letters,
from the Female Part of my Care, to complain of my <hi>Odious Title,</hi> (ſo
they call it!) of PLAIN DEALER.—They had <hi>heard of me, it ſeems, but
did not dream I had any Thing in me.—They took my Buſineſs to have
been Politicks.—They little thought me the Man they find
me.—Inſtead of Humour, and Wit, they look'd for Bluntneſs, and
Malice, from a ſurly, old, Fellow, that was ſetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up for a
Cynick,</hi>—with a great deal more, to the ſame Purpoſe. But one
arch Flirt, among the Reſt, is for <hi>forcing</hi> me to <hi>declare</hi>
myſelf, that People may <hi>know, what to make of me.</hi> She is at a Loſs
how to think, or what to ſay, of my Papers; and can neither <hi>like,</hi>
nor <hi>diſlike,</hi> with any Manner of <hi>Certainty,</hi> till ſhe
hears, whether I am a <hi>Whig,</hi> or a <hi>Tory?</hi>—She adds, in a
Poſtſcript, 
<q rend="inline">"That, perhaps, I may think <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0199100801:264"/>
indifferently of <hi>both,</hi> and pretend to an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent <hi>Neutrality,</hi> like the Old Graſier, in our Civil Wars: who, when he
was met, on the Road, by Either of the oppoſite Parties, and ask'd: <hi>For
King? Or for Parliament?</hi> told 'em.—<hi>For Neither: 'till both were
wiſer.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Hotheads,</hi> and <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Generation, think it a Diſgrace to their Vivacity, not to be as briskly in
the Wrong, as their Anceſtors. And I pity, very heartily, the Condition of
the King's poor Subject, who has ſent me the following Letter.</p>

                  <p>I WISH you wou'd lend me but one Laſh, or two, of your PLAIN

if Things go on, as they ſtand now, an honeſt Man won't be able to travel
the Road, <hi>pro,</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> for a Set of ſilly Buſy-Bodies,
that muſt be medling with us, about Things, that we have other Matters to do,
than to think of. For, you muſt know, Maſter <hi>Plain-Dealer,</hi> if you
pleaſe, That I drive a peaceable Waggon, of my own; and have done ſo,
theſe Thirty Years, without being moleſted in my Calling: till now lately,
that a Pack of ſtrange People have got a Whim into their Heads, <hi>to make
us Engliſhmen, all of one Mind:</hi>—But, if ever they bring it about,
I will be hang'd, for 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0199100801:265"/> ABOUT Six a Clock, in the Morning on the <hi>Nine and Twentieth Day of</hi> May <hi>laſt,</hi> I, and my Waggon, were
met, near a Wood-Side, by a Knot, of fifty, or ſixty, roaring Fellows,
ſtuck all over with <hi>Oaken Boughs</hi>; and loaded with Branches of the
ſame.—They ſtopt me, in the Road, to know, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I lov'd the
Memory of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second.</hi>—I ſaid, <hi>Yes, with
all my Soul.</hi>—At that Word, they fell a dancing, and ſet up a loud <hi>Huzzaing:</hi> waving their Hats, and their Boughs, till my Team became
frighted, and took 'em all to be bewitch'd, and was within a Hair's Breadth of
running away with my Waggon. Then, they hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me a two Quart Brandy-Bottle;
and bid me drink a Dram, <hi>To the Glorious Memory of the Reſtoration:</hi>
And, as ſoon as I had got it down, they gave a great Shout, again, ſtuck my
Horſes, and my Waggon, all over with Green Boughs; ſaid, I was a <hi>very
honeſt Fellow:</hi> and had a <hi>Heart of Engliſh Oak.</hi> And, ſo, we
parted, with much Ceremony, and Satisfaction, on both Sides.</p>
                  <p>BUT, before Eleven, the ſame Day, as I was driving into a Town,
where my Waggon was to <hi>Dine,</hi> there came up, in a great Rage, ſeven
or eight of the Troopers, that were quarter'd there; and ask'd me, <hi>What I
buſh'd out my Horſes for?</hi> I told 'em, <hi>To drive Flies away:</hi>
But they ſaid I was a <hi>Jacobite Raſcal,</hi>—that my <hi>Horſes</hi> were guilty of <hi>High-Treaſon</hi>; and my Waggon ought
to be <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0199100801:266"/> 
                     <hi>hang'd.</hi>—I anſwer'd, That it was
already <hi>drawn</hi>; and within a Yard or two, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Quarter'd</hi>;
but as to being hang'd, It was a Compliment, we had no Occaſion for, and
therefore deſir'd them to take it back again, and keep it in their own Hands,
'till they had an Opportunity to make Uſe of it:—I had no ſooner
ſpoke theſe Words, but they fell upon me, like Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſtript my Cattle
in a Twinkling; and beat me black and blue, with my own Oaken Branches.</p>
                  <p>THIS went off, and I thought no more of it: 'till the <hi>Tenth Day
of</hi> June <hi>came.</hi> I was then Inn'd in <hi>London</hi>; and, from
where my Waggon lay, in <hi>Holborn,</hi> I went to <hi>Soho Square,</hi> to
deliver a little Parcel, that I had brought up, for my Landlord's
Lady.—She order'd, That I ſhould have as much Strong Beer, as I cou'd
drink, and that I ſhould drink a Health to <hi>her
Inclinations.</hi>—She ſmil'd at me, and was ſo kind, as to give me,
out of her own Hand, a fine <hi>Noſegay of White Roſes.</hi> I was very
proud of my Noſegay, for my Lady's Sake, that had given it me: And went along
the Street ſmelling to it, thinking all the Way as I walk'd, How pretty it
looks in your <hi>Gentry,</hi> to be ſo free and good-natur'd with a poor
Man, as I am: When, all of a ſudden, a Scarecrow, lean Man, in a fine lac'd
Coat, ſnatch'd it out of my Hand, and another Gentleman in red, who was along
with Him, <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0199100801:267"/> lent me a Cut croſs the Shoulders, with a
curſed ſmarting Cane, and told me,—That he would teach ſuch a dirty
Dog, as I was, to be ſmelling to <hi>Tory Roſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IF I could have got one of theſe fine Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows all alone with me,
in my Waggon, I ſhou'd have made him <hi>know his Driver.</hi>—But as
it was, I thought it beſt to ſhew him a good Pair of Heels for
it.—Which of us might have <hi>run</hi> faſteſt, in a fair Field of
Battle, I can but give a gueſs at.—Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occaſion, it was <hi>my</hi> Luck to be nimbleſt, and outſtrip Both of 'em.—I don't
know, for my Part, what to make of all theſe Doings. They are ſtrange Times
we live in; and as I love to be muſing, when I have nothing elſe to do,
methinks, very often, as I travel along the Road, from one End of the Kingdom
to another, and find the People of ſuch different Notions, I fancy my Waggon
and I are moving upon a Draft Board; <hi>Old England</hi> is turn'd <hi>Chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Work,</hi> and mix'd Black and White all over. So, wiſhing

            <p>I MADE a Viſit, the other Day, to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who has a
Country-Houſe, near <hi>London</hi>; and, while we refreſh'd ourſelves
with a Social Glaſs, in a Summer Bower, which he has rais'd above the Corner
of his Garden-Wall, I obſerv'd him to fix his Eyes, with much Attention, on
the Gate of a ſtately Building, that ſtood on the oppoſite Side of the
Road.—The Miſtreſs, ſaid he, of that fine Houſe, has been
charming me, all this Morning, in a Poem, which was written, in Praiſe of her
Extraordinary Beauty, by a very celebrated, <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
Genius.—The warm, and lively, Imagination of the Poet has plac'd her
exactly before me! I feel, methinks, the Influence of her Eyes! I am inchanted,
by her Air and Movement!—But I loſe my ſelf in Rapture, while I
ſeem to gaze upon <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0199100801:269"/> that Spring of Youth, which he
deſcribes with ſo much Wantonneſs! That <hi>living, thinking,</hi> Bloom!
that quickens her ſoft Languor; and adds Health, and Joy, to
Lovelineſs.—But, ſee!—Look yonder! The very Charmer comes,
This! this! is ſhe: This gay, young, wiſh'd, ador'd dear Maſter-piece of
Nature; whom I have been reading of, with ſo much Tranſport.</p>
            <p>I STARTED up, in great Amazement; and, inflam'd by eager Curioſity,
look'd out, to ſee this Prodigy.—But I beheld no other than a thin,
wither'd, ſtooping, old Lady; whom Two Servants, with much ſeeming
Difficulty, ſupported; and were leading along, between them, toward a Coach,
that waited for her, at the Gate. Her Head, and both her Hands, ſhook,
ſtrongly, with the Palſey; but every other Part ſeem'd motionleſs, and
quite inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.—I ſigh'd at the Appearance of ſo mortifying an
Object! And recall'd my Eyes, from aking at it, to fix 'em, reproachfully, upon
my Friend, for his ill-pointed Levity, in ſporting with the Weakneſs, and
Miſery of Human Nature.—Yet <hi>This,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>was
once,</hi> ſo chang'd as we now ſee her! that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine! that Godlike! that
reſiſtleſs Miracle! whom, to contemplate, in <hi>Dryden</hi>'s warm
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of her Influence, when the Hearts of a gay Monarch, and a Court
of Rival Lovers, were the Trophies of her Beauty, <hi>Who</hi> cou'd think,
that Time wou'd thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her, to a <hi>Contradiction</hi> of all thoſe
flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0199100801:270"/> Attractions; which, though periſh'd in
the chang'd Original, will bloom, for ever, in the Poet's Picture.</p>
            <p>I PROTEST, the ſudden Shock, which this malicious Artfulneſs of my
good Friend's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality ſurpriz'd and ſtruck me with, quite damp'd, and
overwhelm'd my Chearfulneſs.—I ſicken'd, at this <hi>too near</hi>
and <hi>naked</hi> View of Life, without its <hi>Palliatives.</hi>—I
reſolv'd to drink no more.—Your Wine, ſaid I, has loſt its
Reliſh, and your Society is grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid; from the tingling Thoughts
which you have fill'd me with.—So, riſing for my Hat and Gloves, I took
my Leave abruptly, and walk'd homeward, croſs the Fields, oppreſs'd with
muſing Melancholy.</p>
            <p>I have not, to this Moment, loſt the Weight of its Oppreſſion;
and ſhall never ceaſe to wonder, That the <hi>Young</hi> reflect ſo
ſeldom on the Shortneſs of their Spring, when yet the <hi>Old</hi> are
always near us; and the <hi>Younger</hi> coming up behind, to puſh us forward
into Winter.—It was a ſharp and ſtartling An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That</hi> of
the <hi>Armenian</hi> Beggar, who, leaning double on his Staff, was ask'd by a
young jeſting Coxcomb, How much that <hi>Bow</hi> had coſt him? For I wou'd
be glad, ſaid he, to buy one—<hi>Have Patience,</hi> anſwer'd the old
Man, <hi>and, if God prolongs your Life, you will have as good a one for
nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is but one Thing Here, that can deſerve our conſtant
Thoughts, and that is the very Thing, which we moſt hate to think of! 
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0199100801:271"/>—What ought, ſo frequently, to buſy our
Remembrance, as the only ſure, and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able common Lot of ALL who ever
liv'd, who now do live; or who ſhall live here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?—Where are, now, <hi>Times paſt?</hi>—We toil, and ſtrive, and labour on, through
Life, as if <hi>to live</hi> were our chief Buſineſs! Unmindful, all the
while, what empty Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows we are graſping at; and for how ſhort a Time,
and how uncertainly they can be Ours, when we have gain'd them. What is become
of all thoſe buſy Buſtlers, who have liv'd and died before us? Are they
not vaniſhed, and forgotten? They have made their Way thro' Life, as an Eagle
does through Air; and their Path is clos'd up after them; nor have they left a
Track to follow by.</p>
            <p>TIME is the greateſt of all <hi>Deceivers</hi>; but deceives us,
without <hi>flattering</hi> us.—It has a Tongue in every Steeple; and
points its Finger to the Dial's Shadow, to alarm and give us Notice. But we
neglect its hourly Summons; we truſt its gentle Pace, againſt the
Harſhneſs of its Warning. Yet, were we wiſe, we ſhould think Time a
ſmooth, but precipitate Current, that carries us down to Death, whether we
are bound thither, or no: And <hi>He</hi> will, always, have the rougheſt
Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, who, inſtead of gliding quietly, will be ſtruggling to ſwim
againſt it.</p>
            <p>LIFE has nothing, that is truly deſirable, but the Preſence of
thoſe we love; yet this, of all its Pleaſures, is moſt precarious and 
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0199100801:272"/> unſtable.—Are we charm'd by the Power of <hi>Beauty?</hi> Let us learn from ſuch an Object, as the once blooming Lady,
whom I have been ſpeaking of, that it is a falſe and fluid
Proſpect.—It is chang'd ſince Yeſterday; and will be further
chang'd, To-morrow.—<hi>All,</hi> that is <hi>Ours,</hi> is mutable. We
ſtill, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>live on</hi>; but we are no longer what we have been, nor
can we continue what we are. Though the River is ſtill known by its old Name,
its Waters, To-day, are not the ſame Waters that were Yeſterday. Not our
Blood alone is flowing, and in conſtant Motion; our Faces, Strength, Health,
Comforts, Fears, Joys, Miſeries, and Dangers, all move and mix us in one
Gulph, <hi>Eternity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I KNOW nothing ſo <hi>ridiculous,</hi> as what is call'd being <hi>ſerious:</hi> nor is any thing more <hi>idle,</hi> than what we uſually
term <hi>Buſineſs.</hi>—We wou'd be <hi>fortunate, lov'd, fear'd,
great,</hi> every thing, but what we <hi>ſhou'd be:</hi>—For, whoever,
in this Life, propoſes to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly happy, hopes to build, like the Men
of <hi>Babel</hi>; and wou'd raiſe a Pile, <hi>as high as Heaven,</hi>
without Foundation to erect it on. The World is too narrow to allow
Dimenſions for a <hi>Baſis,</hi> where the wild-intended Height is ſo
unproportionably extravagant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who affect, after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Manner of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Writers, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Moral Doctrine, in a kind of
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial Chain of Parallels; ſay, there are <hi>ſix</hi> Things which a
wiſe Man will ground no <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0199100801:273"/> Hopes on:—The Colour of
a Cloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe imaginary. The Friendſhip of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, becauſe
mercenary. The Love of Women, becauſe inconſtant. Beauty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe frail.
Praiſe, becauſe airy: And, the Pleaſures of this World, becauſe
deceitful.</p>
            <p>IT is equally to be wonder'd at, ſince Life is ſo little valuable,
and Death ſo certain, and unavoidable, 
<q rend="inline">"That we ſhould be ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably fond of the
One; and, ſo fruitleſsly afraid of the Other."</q> There is no Harbour on
this Side <hi>Death:</hi> And, the nearer we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to thoſe ſhining
Follies, which we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue with ſuch dangerous Eagerneſs, the more we
multiply our Cares, and diſtract and weary our own Purpoſes. The whole
Earth is not broad enough for two proud Fools to quarrel in! whereas <hi>Death</hi> is the End of Conteſt, the weary Man's Repoſe, the great
Man's Glory, the ſick Man's Health, the poor Man's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and a Shelter
againſt Wrongs and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p>SINCE a Traveller can enjoy Pleaſure, by often thinking on his
Journey's End, while he is yet but upon the Road toward it; why might not Death
be made familiar to us, and diſrob'd of its falſe Terrors, by accuſtoming
ourſelves to look out for it? To acquaint our ſelves with it, at a
Diſtance, during our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, through Life to it? Life is, properly, a
Journey; but differs from our other Journeys, of leſs Conſequence, in this
ſurprizing Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, 
<q rend="inline">"That we are travelling as faſt, while 
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0199100801:274"/> we are ſleeping, and intend no Progreſs; as, when we
are awake, and know we are moving.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LIFE, then, being a Journey, Death, I think, may be conſider'd as an <hi>Inn</hi> at the <hi>Land's End:</hi> And, ſince the Traveller, when he
comes thither, is ſtill oblig'd to go farther; and muſt ſet out for
Diſcoveries, upon a deep and unknown Ocean; if he takes not along with him,
fit Proviſions for his Voyage, he muſt be either a Fool or a Madman.</p>
            <p>THE Difference between the <hi>Great</hi> Man, and the <hi>Good</hi>
Man, is never ſo plainly ſeen as when they, both, come to <hi>die.</hi>
Then, the one ſhuts his Eyes; and ſteps, trembling, and in the Dark, into
the Dreadfulneſs of Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: While the other ſmiles, with Joy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Enlargement of his opening Proſpect; and comes, out of a miry Labyrinth,
into Day-light, and a boundleſs <hi>Champian!</hi>—I ſometimes take
Pleaſure to conſider the Birth of Man, as a Commitment of his Soul to
Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; where, during the Life of the Body, it is chain'd ſhort, and can
move but a creeping Pace; and in limited and dusky Stages. But, it is ſet
free, and unfetter'd, by Death, and, at one Spring, reaches Heaven.—Such
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge is, to the Soul, what Light is, to the Eye; when it opens Colours,
and Objects, which before, were conceal'd in Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus, then, when it is ſaid, we <hi>die,</hi> we are rather <hi>born</hi> into real Being; we are infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis'd, by the Grant of Death, and
incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0199100801:275"/> among the Millions upon Millions, who have
died before us. Thoſe we leave, are a Number, very ſmall and
inconſiderable, in Compariſon with thoſe we go to. The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, the
Prophets, the Apoſtles, the heroick Conquerors, the ſhining Poets of
Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the whole, aſſembled Congreſs, of long-known and
glorious, Characters, who have flouriſh'd, from the World's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are to
be the Company, to whoſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Converſe <hi>Death</hi> will introduce
us.—And, that we may add one charming Hope, to warm and ſweeten, all
the reſt! <hi>There,</hi> too, we ſhall, perhaps, embrace, and be
reſtor'd to, thoſe loſt Friends, we lov'd, moſt dearly: and whom we
never more expected to have met with.</p>
            <p>BUT, I will, now, relieve my Readers from the Severity of theſe
Reflections, by entertaining them with a Copy of Verſes; which, I am
aſſur'd, were, really, written to a Lady, eminent for her Wit, and Beauty:
by a Gentleman, who thought it no Diſgrace to her Lovelineſs, to mix his
Admiration of it, with the Memory, that ſhe was mortal.</p>

Volatile;</hi> who may have <hi>Wit,</hi> for any thing I know to the contrary:
But, as for <hi>Money,</hi> I dare be poſitive, that the firſt Time he
ſaves <hi>Six-pence,</hi> will be when he has but a <hi>Groat</hi> in his
Pocket. And yet this extravagant young Fellow (as I have lately been well
inform'd) has the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand Impudence to <hi>make Love to my
Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>!—A Whim took him, while we were merry together, that he
muſt ſet himſelf, forſooth, to <hi>Scribbling.</hi>—Preſently,
it comes into my Head, that he was writing a Love-Letter to my Daughter: And
ſo, pretending to mind nothing but Talking, I lean'd back in my Chair, and
overlook'd what he was doing.—But, as if the young Rogue had had Eyes in
his Elbows, he broke off what he had begun, and writ, thus, in a new
Place.—<hi>If an impertinent Old Fellow, that ſits by me, did not
overlook what I am writing, I ſhould have told you a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Secret</hi>—I let him alone, as far as this; but, then, being thoroughly
provok'd, at his calling me Names, I told him round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That he was a Lyar,

                     <hi>Word, that I overlook'd his Letter, when I had not
ſo much as ſeen a ſingle Word he had been writing.</hi>—The only

now, ſays he, it is Low-Water, in thoſe Parts, and the Danger of Drowning
not half ſo great, as it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. But, I believe, I ſhall ſtay,
till their New Houſe is quite finiſh'd; and, then, perhaps, I may, for any
thing I ſee to the contrary, ſtay ſtill a little longer: For the young
King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſeems to have more in his Head than ordinary. They
ſay he is <hi>angry with the Iriſh</hi> already, becauſe of the Buſtle
they made at <hi>Cadiz</hi> lately; and, if the <hi>next he falls out with</hi>
ſhou'd be the <hi>Engliſh, South-Sea</hi> will go near to pinch for
it.—Beſides, who can tell (you know) what may happen, upon the Choice
of this <hi>New Pope?</hi> He won't let People wear good Cloaths: And, ſome
of our publick Prints ſay, that he is ſo horribly covetous, that he makes
the Cardinals go bald-headed, to ſave the Charge of buying Perriwigs! Pray,
what can be his Meaning, in all this, but only to ruin the <hi>Proteſtant
In-Intereſt,</hi> and make <hi>Stocks fall,</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Trade,</hi>
in downright Spite to <hi>Old England?</hi> The poor Bays-Makers, at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> ſeem to ſuffer for it, already: And the Weavers that
are <hi>Up,</hi> about <hi>Columpton,</hi> have much ado to be kept <hi>Quiet</hi> at it!—Then, again, What could the <hi>French King</hi>
mean, by calling home the <hi>Marſhal de Villeroy?</hi> I make no Doubt, but
there is ſome Miſchief in <hi>that</hi> too.—In ſhort, while Things
ſtand in this <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0199100801:281"/> tickliſh Poſture, a wary Man will
think twice, before he runs into the <hi>Stocks.</hi>—Indeed, if the King
of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> ſhould come over, there might be ſome Reaſon for
ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing: But, as it is, I am afraid, I muſt lay out my Money in <hi>Lottery Tickets:</hi> For, when all comes to all, <hi>that</hi> is the only <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Certainty.</hi>—Knowing you to be a long-headed Man,

                  <p>THIS comes to acquaint you, That my dear Spouſe is taken ſick,
of a ſudden, and ſtands in need, to the utmoſt Degree, of that Experience
in <hi>Mind-Midwifery,</hi> which you gave out Bills about, in your XXVIIth
Paper.—Pray, let Doctor <hi>Jyngle</hi> be ſent for, immediately: And
beg him to come away, whether his Chariot is brought home or no.—We
muſt have him, though he comes in a Wheel-barrow.—The Bearer knows how
to bring him: And, pray, let his <hi>Emetics</hi> be ſuch as will work deep,
and fetch up <hi>Choler,</hi> as well as <hi>Flegm.</hi>—Rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jealouſy</hi> is the Diſtemper: And, if the <hi>Bitter,</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> and <hi>Yellow,</hi> that lie as low as my poor <hi>Fubſy</hi>'s Heart, is not, all, brought away by it, he had e'en as good <hi>give her a Caudle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT, unleſs Doctor <hi>Jyngle</hi> has better Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, for
ſick Minds, than thoſe <hi>Poetical Pills,</hi> which you preſcribe, out
of the <hi>Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſpenſatory,</hi> I ſhall have little Faith in
his <hi>Modus</hi> of <hi>Practiſing.</hi>—I have try'd, to no
Purpoſe, an admirable <hi>Modern Doctor,</hi> who has given us finer <hi>Recipe's</hi> of that Kind, for Cure of either the Hot or Cold 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0199100801:283"/> Fits of <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> than the whole College of
your <hi>Ancients, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.—I
love him at my Heart, and have moſt of his Lectures <hi>without Book.</hi>
And, I am ſure, he is profoundly skill'd in my dear Love's Diſtemper, by
this feeling Force, with which he ſpeaks of it: 
<q> 
                        <l>Oh, Jealouſy!—All other Storms are <hi>Calms</hi>
                        </l> 
                        <l>To <hi>Thee!</hi>—Thou <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the
Soul!</l> 
                     </q> 
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT Word <hi>Conflagration,</hi> is the very Picture of my <hi>Fubſy</hi>'s Symptoms!—I had prepared, from the Salutary Works of
this learned Gentleman, a healing <hi>Linctus,</hi> that I thought infallible,
if my afflicted Deary cou'd be perſuaded but to apply her Tongue to it now
and then, in order to dulcify her picquant Palate, when the acid Particles
ſhould riſe too vehemently. I had got it ready written, upon a Sheet of her
own gilt Paper; and the laſt Time ſhe was taken, I gave it kindly into her
Hands, and deſired her to apply it moderately. She look'd it over, with great
Compoſure; and I began to conceive ſuch Hope, that I took up an untaſted <hi>Sillabub,</hi> that had juſt been ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and intreated her, if
the Phyſick was too bitter, that ſhe would waſh down the Taſte of it,
with a Sip or two of that emollient Sweetner. But the Spout was no ſooner
within a Foot of her pretty Lips, when the <hi>Conflagration,</hi>
abovemention'd, <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0199100801:284"/> blaz'd out at both her Eyes; and, with a
frightful flaming Face, ſhe tore the <hi>Recipe</hi> in a thouſand Pieces;
and burnt ſo ſtrong, and ſo outragiouſly, that, fearing I ſhould be
ſcorch'd as ſhe flew toward me, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, juſt then, provided with
one of Mr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>'s <hi>Chymical Extinguiſhers,</hi> I had no Way
left to quench the Fire, but by Affuſion of my <hi>Sillabub</hi>; which, very
fortunately, <hi>put her out,</hi> by the Copiouſneſs of its Adheſion.
But I was ſo frighted at the Ebullition that enſued immediately upon it,
that I ran away as faſt as I was able; having left her a good deal cool'd,
and in a fair Way to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd.</p>
                  <p>I THOUGHT it proper to give you this Intelligence, how far I have
fail'd, that Doctor <hi>Jyngle</hi> may come, prepar'd, with more powerful, and
ſearching Remedies.—Let him make but a thorough Cure, and I'll warrant
him we do his Buſineſs. There are Nine-and-Thirty Ladies of Quality, of my <hi>Fubſy</hi>'s particular Acquaintance, who are All down, at this very
Time, of the ſelf-ſame Diſtemper; and All taken, too, with the <hi>Conflagration,</hi> exactly as ſhe, her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is. He ſhall never want
good Patients, if his <hi>Emeticks</hi> but go to the Bottom.—I am, in no
ſmall Impatience,</p>

a <hi>Wiſe.</hi>—I had been in Love above three Years, and never got
three good Words from the dear Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; 'till I went a Fiſhing with her, one
hot Evening, in the Middle of laſt Month.—She delighted much in
Angling, out of an old Summer-Houſe, over a River, that makes part of her own
Royalty.—Upon theſe Occaſions, you muſt know, I was always her <hi>Humble Trout</hi>; and it was my Buſineſs to bait her Hooks, and ſit,
and read to her while ſhe watch'd her Fiſhing Rods. But, that happy
Evening, abovemention'd, I had, upon a Hint out of Doctor <hi>Donne,</hi>

            <p>I NEVER wak'd in more Harmony, and Compoſure of Mind, than I did
Yeſterday Morning; when, riſing chearfully, with my Spirits more diffuſed
than ordinary, I viſited my Friend the <hi>Major,</hi> whoſe Face, as often
as I ſee it, makes me happier than I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. From his firm, and ſteady
Temper, I learn to break the Force of my Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the Patience
with which I receive them: And I am taught, by his Generoſity, to feel the
Weight of no Misfortunes, but thoſe which oppreſs my Friends, whom I love,
without being able to comfort.—When I ſee this Gentleman deſpiſing,
and even adorning <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0199100801:289"/> himſelf by, his Afflictions, I am
aſhamed to have ever murmured, or conſidered my own as burthenſome.</p>
            <p>I FOUND this faithful Friend reading one of my printed Papers, and
entertaining his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Family, with all the Chearfulneſs of the
Fortunate.—He roſe, and received me, ſmiling. I have been Reaſoning
away ſome Pain, ſaid he, by the Influence of your PLAIN DEALER. How
powerful are your Thoughts? And how happy am I in your Friendſhip? What a
Force of Delight comes with the Praiſe of thoſe we love? It is Muſick to
the Mind, and our Cares diſſolve before it.</p>
            <p>THE generous Fulneſs of his Heart, was prepared to ſay much more,
if I had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him, by propoſing a Walk into the Fields.—It
was one of thoſe ſweet, ſunleſs Days, when, though no Place was
ſhelter'd, yet every Place would be ſhady. We had wander'd, without
deſigning it, 'till we found ourſelves by <hi>Chelſea-College.</hi> The
Grandeur, Uſe, and Beauty of that Building, charm'd us into a ſhort
Silence, which the <hi>Major</hi> broke agreeably, by theſe apt, and juſt,
Reflections.</p>
            <p>THOUGH <hi>Charity</hi> is laſt in Rank, when we name the three
great Virtues, it ſtands firſt, methinks, in Dignity; for it ſeems to
include the others. There may be <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> where there
is no <hi>Charity</hi>; but there can be no <hi>Charity</hi> without <hi>both.</hi> It imploys <hi>Faith</hi> in the eaſy Credit which it allows
to affirm'd and rational Appearances: And it applies <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0199100801:290"/> 
               <hi>Hope</hi> to its own, and others Benefit, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging an Expectation,
that all that is amiſs, will mend; and Ills produce good Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The
common Notion of this Virtue, centers in a contracted Beneficence toward the
Support of the Poor and Needy: And that, too, for the moſt Part, when the
Beſtower has no longer the Power of enjoying what he parts with. Whereas <hi>Charity,</hi> in its nobleſt Senſe, requires a Return of <hi>good
Offices,</hi> to the very Malice that oppreſſes us: For, it teaches us not
only to <hi>act well,</hi> but alſo to <hi>think generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>—It
baniſhes from the human Soul, all its ſordid Affections; All Partiality to
our own Intereſts; All Attachment to our own Opinions; All Jealouſies, and
low Suſpicions, concerning the Deſigns, Words, and Actions, of thoſe we
hear of, or converſe with. It is, in ſhort, the great Refiner, and Ennobler
of the Mind: It ſwells the Heart with Pity, Friendſhip, Juſtice, Pardon,
Openneſs, and Magnanimity; And ſtifles the inward Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of
Self-preference, Revenge, Diſtruſt, Pride, Avarice, and Ignorance.</p>
            <p>THOUGH it is certain, anſwered I, That <hi>Charity,</hi> at full
Extent, is no leſs than you deſcribe her; yet, even in the Senſe moſt
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, her Influence is ſweet, and amiable. How wretched would many
Thouſands be, through want of the moſt common Comforts, if Oſtentation
did not borrow the white Robe of Charity, to diſguiſe her Pride of Heart,
in the Appearance of Humility! And if the <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0199100801:291"/> Miſer, on
the Brink of Life, did not fill his trembling Hands with Benefits, that bleſs
the Deſtitute as effectually, as if his Will, and not his Penitence, had
urged him to beſtow them!</p>
            <p>HOW many want the Pity, which even an Hoſpital can give them? How
many return hungry, cold, weary, diſappointed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing, to their
famiſh'd, and unfriended Children? What double Death would it be to an
unhoping, wanting Husband, to ſee the Breaſt of a lov'd Wife dry'd up with
killing Want; and a dying Infant held, in vain, to her inſenſible,
exhauſted Boſom?—I know, you feel not that you can be miſerable,
'till you think of the <hi>more miſerable:</hi> And I ſhould not,
therefore, haunt ſo apprehenſive a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, with Apparitions of
imagined Sorrow. But, how frequent would ſuch Lots become, if not prevented
by the <hi>late,</hi> indeed, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>welcome,</hi> Bounty, of thoſe
Founders, even of our common Houſes of Compaſſion? Our Monuments of
Death-Bed Bribery! to which, for the Example's ſake, <hi>This</hi> World
allows the Name of Charity!</p>
            <p>IT has been remarked, but, I hope, it was unjuſtly, That the Charity
of Women is much narrower than that of Men.—If this is true, it is an
Accident which muſt be owing to ſome Error in their Education; for Nature
meant it otherwiſe, and ſoften'd their tender Minds, to fit them for
Impreſſions of a mild, and pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quality.—In all the Sculptures,
and fine Paintings of Antiquity, we ſee Charity repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented 
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0199100801:292"/> as a ſmiling <hi>Woman,</hi> to ſhew, it is the <hi>Sex's Virtue</hi>; and, that Sweetneſs, Grace, and Bounty, ſhould adorn
a Lady's Lovelineſs.—When I ſee a Woman fortunate, yet narrow-minded,
and unmerciful, I look with Scorn upon her Beauty, and think moſt upon the
Droſs it covers. I grow angry at beholding ſuch a gay and gilded Sepulchre,
and turn my Eyes from her ſhining Duſt, to the more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Earth, which
it was taken from.</p>
            <p>HOW different, replied the <hi>Major,</hi> from ſuch a Woman as you
are deſcribing, is the charming <hi>Belvidera?</hi> I have ſeen her lovely
Features, which give new Joy to the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> languiſh, and look
comfortleſs, when ſhe has heard of the <hi>Unhappy.</hi>—Her Voice,
which wakes the Soul, and calls it up into the Ear, with all the Muſick of a
Trumpet, falls, and trembles, when ſhe talks of Wretchedneſs, which ſhe
is ſenſible ſhe cannot remedy. The Numbers whom ſhe obliges, have two
Rival Benefactors, which divide and perplex their Gratitude; for they know not
which moſt merits it, her <hi>Manner,</hi> or her <hi>Bounty.</hi>—To
ſuch a ſweet Exceſs of Tenderneſs does <hi>Belvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera</hi> raiſe her
Charity, that ſhe would be old, unſeen, unlovely, rather than adorable, as
ſhe now is; becauſe ſhe <hi>pains,</hi> where ſhe muſt <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pity.</hi>—She is, at once, the moſt charming, and leaſt conſcious,
of all Women!</p>
            <p>WHILE we were ſpeaking of her, we were ſurprized in the moſt
agreeable Manner poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, by the Sight of her Chariot paſſing us. 
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0199100801:293"/>—She bowed very humbly, and order'd it to ſtop;
and, while her Servants retir'd, with a Politeneſs and Senſibility, which I
have very ſeldom remark'd in Perſons of their low Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſhe
receiv'd us with an Air of Sweetneſs, that reſembled the Idea which we have
of a deſcending Angel.—She lamented, that ſhe was in her Chariot;
becauſe her Coach, ſhe ſaid, might have held us all; ſhe wou'd,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>leave</hi> it, to bleſs our Walk. The Major offer'd her his
Arm; at which I felt a kind of fooliſh Envy, which I knew not how to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile with my growing Paſſion for <hi>Patty Amble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW attractive is Beauty, when it is ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd by the humbleſt
Modeſty, and yet dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd by Wit and Majeſty!—She buſied and
delighted my Soul; and I was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by her Voice and Sentiments,
that I fell in Love with my own Silence, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd the Pleaſure
of her Speaking.</p>
            <p>WE were join'd in this Place, very unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, by <hi>Ned
Volatile,</hi> who had enquir'd for us at the <hi>Major</hi>'s, and rambled
hither in purſuit of us. He had never ſeen <hi>Belvidera,</hi> nor ſo
much as knew who ſhe was, yet came up with his uſual Air, of brisk

Friends engag'd in a Confederacy againſt my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty!</hi> Then he retreated,
with a kind of counterfeit Aſtoniſhment, and, lowering his Voice, went on

               <hi>what undeſerv'd good Opinion you may
have, of theſe grave Gentlemen; but I ſhall never be brought to think
patiently of 'em again.—'Twas ungenerous, and unpardonable, to give a
poor Wretch no Warning; but draw him in, with an unguarded Breaſt, to ſtand
the Mark of all theſe Charms, where it is impoſſible but I muſt fall by
ſome of 'em!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Believe me, Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Belvidera,</hi> with a Mixture
of Diſdain and Compaſſion; <hi>The Danger you complain of, is too ſmall
to excuſe your Terror.—However open your Heart may lie, few firſt
Blows reach thither.—If you are wounded at Sight, the Hurt was only in
your Eyes; and the Armour, you ſhould have been defended by, was not a
Breaſt-Plate, but a Head-Piece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL never forget, with what an Air of Surprize and Awe, poor <hi>Ned Volatile</hi> ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, at the piercing Voice of <hi>Belvidera,</hi> and from the ſmiling Sharpneſs of her Satire: But I
love the young Rogue's Virtue; and, I own, my Heart triumph'd for him, under
the Mortification of this Retreat; for it ſate on him, methought, more
gracefully, than all his natural Gayety.</p>
            <p>HE kept behind us all the Way, in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and becoming
Confuſion, liſtning, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, to <hi>Belvidera,</hi> without one
Attempt to Rally: But I obſerv'd him, at length, draw out his Pocket-Book
with a Sigh; in which, he writ for Three or Four Minutes, and then, giving it
into my Hands, I found he had been <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0199100801:295"/> penning down his <hi>Dying Speech,</hi> with a woful Warning to all Chriſtian People, to take
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by his Suffering.</p>

            <p>I COU'D not reſiſt the Temptation I was under, to make Atonement
for <hi>Ned</hi>'s Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, by preſenting his Poetick Penitence to the
Divine <hi>Belvidera:</hi> She perus'd it with a conſcious Bluſh, and an
Air of eloquent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which has given a reviving Hope to the
Diſtreſs of her new Lover. But it robb'd us too ſoon of her Company; for
ſhe took Leave preſently after, and, permitting her Hand to <hi>Ned

diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd.</p>
            <p>THE Major and I, were for returning to our firſt Subject, and had

ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, was become, on a ſudden, the darling Theme of his
Converſation.—Groves, Brooks, and <hi>Belvidera,</hi> were the Objects
of his ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd Fancy.—Silence, Thought, Shade, Solitude, Things which
he had never before a Notion of, preſented themſelves to his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
as the moſt deſirable Delights of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—The Major oblig'd him
beyond Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and won all that remain'd of his Heart, by talking to
him of a Poem, which he cou'd ſhew him, when he came Home, call'd, <hi>The

            <p>WHEN Souls of a ſuperior Form, look <hi>Abroad,</hi> and diſcover
among their honeſt Inferiors, Minds capable of the fineſt Impreſſions,
and only in Danger of being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0199100801:298"/> barren by Poverty,
Ignorance, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; they take a Godlike Pleaſure in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
their own Virtues: they ſtrive, with the moſt Praiſe-worthy Charity, to
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the more influencing Power of their own good Example in the
Room of evil Patterns by others, 'till, by turning Injuries into Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
they raiſe their obſcure Neighbours, to bright Images of themſelves.</p>
            <p>ALL Perſons, who are Favourites of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who ſhine in exalted
Stations, who are gifted with large Poſſeſſions, and ſurrounded with
a Multiplicity of Dependents, have the Bleſſing, I have been ſpeaking of,
in their Power. They may chooſe for their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, the Diſtreſs'd
of both Sexes, whom Poverty has render'd humble enough to wiſh to become <hi>Servants</hi>; and whoſe Diſcretion, adapting their Nature to their
Condition, has taught them the Spirit of Obedience, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
            <p>A GOOD Maſter may be conſider'd as the Soul of his Family, who
communicates Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Dignity to all, who are under his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and
animates them by his own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be, in ſome meaſure, like himſelf;
his Houſe will be the Habitation of Wiſdom, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Honour. If ſuch a
Maſter be at Home, and a Stranger wants Acceſs to him, that Stranger will
be prejudiced in his Favour, even before he beholds him; for it is eaſy, and
natural, to read in the Voices, Looks and Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the People <hi>below

Deportment of his Domeſticks; and their grateful Manner of receiving all
Perſons who inquire after him, proclaims the Goodneſs of their Maſter.
All the Honour, or, Diſhonour, of a Family, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to the Source, and

            <p>THERE are too many <hi>haughty Flutterers,</hi> in the World, made
giddily vain and unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by too much Proſperity, who <hi>dream,</hi> that
People of low Condition, ought to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd; and that <hi>Servants,</hi>
becauſe <hi>Servants,</hi> ſhould not be treated as of the ſame Species
with themſelves. Theſe Gentlemen, as they muſt be call'd, have
Underſtandings abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too coarſe to be come at by Railery: They ought
to be bluntly told, That <hi>good Servants</hi> might make <hi>good
Maſters,</hi> and that theirs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs good Qualities of which
themſelves appear to be deſtitute. They ought in very plain Terms, to be
informed, That <hi>Reaſon</hi> has plac'd their Servants above them, tho'
themſelves are pleaſed, unreaſonably, to deſpiſe them, becauſe
Fortune, without Demerit of theirs, had placed them <hi>ſeemingly</hi>
lower.</p>
            <p>A LOW and obſcure Birth has been often the Lot of a high, and noble

that ſhe can produce ſuch valuable Creatures, in <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0199100801:300"/> the
moſt abject <hi>State</hi> of Servitude: A <hi>Plain-Dealing,</hi> faithful
Servant is a Jewel of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Value.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Compaſſion</hi> due to honeſt Men, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their
Poverty, muſt, after having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Integrity, be refin'd into <hi>Regard,</hi> and <hi>Eſteem.</hi> I have, for this Reaſon,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd it as a well-ſpirited Piece of Advice in Monſieur <hi>Bruyere,</hi> who writes like an <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Gentleman,</hi> when
he counſels all, <hi>of that</hi> Rank, <hi>to treat</hi> a Good Old
Domeſtick, <hi>rather like a</hi> Friend <hi>than a</hi> Servant. And truly,
it is far from impoſſible, but that a Maſter may ſtand in need of
ſuch a Servant for his Friend, and find him, upon Trial, a much better, than
thoſe inconſtant Comrades, whom the World, in their miſtaken Phraſe,
would be apt to call <hi>his Betters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I LATELY had a Story told me to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and if it affects the
Reader, as it did me, he will not be diſpleaſed, that I give it him by way
of Example.</p>
            <p>A GENTLEMAN named <hi>Belmont</hi>; a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Diſtinction,
filled an honourable Poſt in the Army, and behaved himſelf well during the
late Wars in <hi>Flanders.</hi> He is Honeſt, Brave, Hearty, Sincere,
Generous, and Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; was generally courted for his Company by his Brother
Officers, and univerſally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by his Soldiers. In thoſe Sunſhine
Days of his Proſperity, <hi>Belmont</hi> held dear, as his Boſom-Intimate,
a Gentleman, by Name, <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>; and had one particular Servant, whom,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0199100801:301"/> on account of many rare Qualities, he loved above the
reſt, and treated as Monſieur <hi>Bruyere</hi> adviſes, and whom, for the
Sake of his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to his Maſter, we will call <hi>Fido.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>BELMONT,</hi> and <hi>Celſus</hi> lived, indeed, like true
Friends: And, as if each thought the other's Intereſt his own, they
commutually, as Exigences on either Side required, furniſhed one another with
Money, and deſired no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or Security. At length, when they had long
loved and lived together, <hi>Celſus,</hi> was called to another Quarter:
Never did Soul and Body part with more Reluctancy than theſe Friends, being <hi>leſs</hi> certain when, and where, and how, they ſhould meet again.
Much about the ſame Time, <hi>Fido,</hi> having been bred to a Trade, and got
a little Stock by his Maſter, had Thoughts of ſetting up in the World. His
Maſter, when he diſcharged him, added to the Salary he paid him, a
handſome Preſent, and wiſhed him good Fortune, with ſuch Familiarity
and Condeſcenſion, as made the <hi>Wiſh</hi> more endearing than the <hi>Preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AFTER this, if we behold <hi>Belmont,</hi> it muſt be under a Cloud
of Evils: He met with croſs and ſevere Accidents which reduced him to
narrower Circumſtances, than ſuited ſo liberal a Soul: He, who delighted
in extricating others out of Troubles and Perplexities, was, at length,
involv'd in Difficulties himſelf. In a word, his Affairs were brought to that
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that a certain Sum muſt be punctually paid on ſuch a Day, or <hi>Belmont</hi> be expoſed to <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0199100801:302"/> ſuch an indecent
Diſtreſs, as it is painful but to think of.</p>
            <p>MANY Meaſures he had try'd, in vain, to make Proviſion againſt
it: He was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many Perſons of Faſhion, who had been laviſh
of their Vows of Friendſhip, and profuſe, even to Prodigality, in offering
him their Services, at Times, when they well knew there was no Danger in the
Offer. He tried them all in their Turns: And found them, all, falſe
alike.</p>
            <p>HOW will it go with poor <hi>Belmont,</hi> who has the Ill-luck of
ſuch Acquaintance? why, the Reader will be pleaſed to hear, That <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> is return'd to <hi>England,</hi> as much in the Abundance,
as <hi>Belmont</hi> in the Want of all Things, and ſettled within a Mile or
two of <hi>London.</hi> On him were <hi>Belmont</hi>'s Eyes turn'd from the
ſad Scene that threaten'd him: Here he is ſure to be right; Here his
Addreſs muſt prevail: I fancy myſelf walking over the Fields with <hi>Belmont</hi>; I hear him ſay, he is no longer to groan under his
Misfortunes, than till they can reach the Ear of <hi>Celſus</hi>; They want
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards being reliev'd, but being bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid before him: Then <hi>Belmont</hi> is to aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with the Falſhood and Meanneſs of
his other Acquaintance. Thus ſoothing his Imagination, he arrives at the
Houſe of <hi>Celſus,</hi> is receiv'd with the Warmth of Friendſhip; he
opens his Complaint, and tells the Story of the Uſage he had met with. Here
the Reader will be ſtunn'd—the Story was as unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble 
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0199100801:303"/> in the Ear of <hi>Celſus,</hi> as if their
Friendſhip, had been a Fable.</p>
            <p>AS <hi>Belmont</hi> was returning home croſs the Fields, loaded with
heavy Reflections, with whom ſhould he meet, but his old Man <hi>Fido!</hi>
walking out with an Intention to lie that Night at his Country-Lodgings, for
the Benefit of the Air. <hi>Fido</hi> would walk back, part of the Way with his
Maſter: And finding him very melancholy, implored him to tell the Cauſe of
it.—At length <hi>Belmont,</hi> half ſmiling, ſaid, Thou can'ſt not
help me in it, honeſt <hi>Fido</hi>; and yet, with a Sigh, ſaid he, now I
think on't, I will tell thee, for thou knoweſt <hi>Celſus.</hi>—Thou
muſt remember him.—Sir, reply'd <hi>Fido,</hi> and ever
ſhall.—I can't forget your beſt Friend: I hope he is not
dead!—<hi>Belmont</hi> told him the whole Story: Juſt as he had
finiſh'd it; they reach a little publick Houſe on the
Road—<hi>Fido,</hi> without anſwering, begg'd him to walk in, called
for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and wrote a Note for the Money, and giving it his
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſaid thus; <hi>I am glad at my Heart it was a Sum within my Power,
without breaking in upon my Stock, becauſe I ſhould have parted with it
All; for, Sir, I owe it All to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us conſider <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Fido, Celſus</hi> a
Friend and a Companion; <hi>Fido</hi> a Menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: <hi>Fido</hi> a Weaver
of fine Silks, <hi>Celſus</hi> a Wearer of finer; how then ſhall we
reconcile this Matter, That <hi>Celſus,</hi> after all this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in
Subſtance and Figure, ſhould be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gentleman in <hi>Appearance,
Fido</hi> in <hi>Reality?</hi> 
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0199100801:304"/> It is eaſy to anſwer,
that the Stage of Life is like the Theatre, where the principal Parts acted,
are not always the beſt: It is not <hi>what</hi> Part we act, but <hi>how</hi> we act it, that gives us Applauſe. I have frequently known a

the <hi>Serious</hi> with the <hi>Humorous,</hi> treating the moſt ſolemn
Subjects after a light and wanton Manner, we have eſtabliſhed a falſe
Taſte of Wit, which has inſenſibly, like an unnoted Current, declin'd us
from our right Courſe, and brought us ſo far out of our Way, that it will
be ſome Time before we find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reſtored to our old
Reliſh.—The ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <pb n="297" facs="tcp:0199100801:306"/> Shape of the Modern
Muſe, is made for becoming the <hi>Hoop-Petticoat</hi>; but there was a
charming, majeſtick <hi>Nakedneſs</hi> in that ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Simplicity, and
plain Soundneſs of <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick Nature,</hi> which went to the <hi>Hearts</hi> of our Forefathers, without ſtopping at their <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> or winding itſelf into their Underſtanding, through a Maze
of myſtical Prettineſſes.</p>
            <p>BUT, though this venerable, <hi>undreſs'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is ſeldom
to be met with now; and has, indeed, been loſt among us, for above a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,</hi> it was ſo frequent Two or Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years ago, that
their loweſt Claſs of Poets, the Compoſers of our good Old Ballads, have
left us ſome of the nobleſt Examples of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,</hi> in its
moſt ſtriking Energy. But, in the preſent Practice, it is ſtifled, as
the <hi>Roman</hi> Maid was, under the Oppreſſion of Golden Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
Bracelets, Jewels, and heap'd Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the <hi>Gothick Armory.</hi>
Yet, now and then, we ſtart upon it in the Writings of our Modern Poets; as I
did, the other Day, in an <hi>Ode, on the Power of Muſick,</hi> which was
writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a young <hi>Scots</hi> Gentleman, who has conveyed, in a naked
Grandeur, and in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Degree of Plainneſs, the following awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Thought, which carries a Terror, that will ſhake the Soul of every attentive
Reader.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>When Living Men ſhall die, and Dead Men live,</l> 
               <l>And <hi>Order</hi> is, again, to <hi>Chaos</hi> hurl'd;</l> 
               <l>Thou, <hi>Melody!</hi> ſhalt ſtill ſurvive,</l> 
               <l>And triumph o'er the <hi>Ruins</hi> of the <hi>World!</hi>
               </l> 
               <l>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0199100801:307"/>A dreadful Trumpet, never heard before,</l> 
               <l>By <hi>Angels</hi> never blown, 'till then,</l> 
               <l>Through all the <hi>Regions</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> ſhall

               <l>
                  <hi>That</hi> Time <hi>is now no more!</hi>
               </l> 
            </q>
            <p>BUT the Accident, which has drawn me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Lamentation for the
Loſs of <hi>Nature,</hi> in our Works of Wit and Poetry, where ſhe ought
moſt to ſhew herſelf, is, my having taken up, in a late Perambulation, as
I ſtood upon the Top of <hi>Primroſe-Hill,</hi> a torn Leaf of one of
thoſe Half-penny Miſcellanies, which are publiſhed for the Uſe and
Pleaſure of our <hi>Nymphs of low Degree,</hi> and known by the Name of <hi>Garlands</hi>—That Part of it, which firſt caught my Eye, had its
Turn a little too <hi>Modern,</hi> as well in the Matter, as the Poetry, and
celebrated the Midnight Triumphs of ſome <hi>ſtraggling Female,</hi> of
whom I had no Knowledge; but one, it ſhould ſeem, of more Beauty than
Delicacy; 
<q> 
                  <l>Who took the Place of Ladies bright,</l> 
                  <l>And with their Lords lay all the Night!</l> 
                  <l>Who pleas'd them with her Humour free;</l> 
                  <l>Oh! the charming <hi>Sally Sal'sbu—ree!</hi>
                  </l> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I paſs'd lightly over this Lyrick Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as too ludicrous
for a Perſon of my Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and fell, unexpectedly, upon a <hi>Work,</hi>
for ſo I make no Scruple to call it, that deſerves to live for Ever! And
which (notwithſtanding its Diſguiſe of coarſe, brown Paper, almoſt 
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0199100801:308"/> unintelligible Corruptions of <hi>Senſe,</hi> from the
Blunders of the Preſs, with here and there an obſolete, low Phraſe, which
I have alter'd for the clearer Explanation of the Author's Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) is ſo
powerfully filled, throughout, with that Blood-curdling, chilling Influence, of
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, working on our Paſſions (which Criticks call the <hi>Sublime</hi>)
that I never met it ſtronger in <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf; nor even in that

            <p>I AM ſorry I am not able to acquaint my Reader with <hi>his</hi>
Name, to whom we owe this melancholy Piece, of <hi>finiſh'd Poetry,</hi>
under the humble Title of a <hi>Ballad.</hi>—<hi>Such Ballads</hi> were
the reverend Fragments of disjointed <hi>Homer,</hi> when they were ſung
about the Streets of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities, before <hi>Lycurgus</hi>
cauſed the Limbs to be aſſembled into Union; and ſo piec'd, redeem'd,
and conſecrated them to the End of Time, as we now ſee 'em in his <hi>Iliad.</hi>—Yet, the Common Fate of Merit is ſo unequal to its
Claim, that one might almoſt venture to conclude, That this <hi>great
Genius,</hi> whoever he was, lived poor, and died unknown; in Want perhaps, of
Eaſe and Comfort, while he had Excellence, that merited a Nation's Gratitude,
for the Honour he might have lived to do it.</p>
            <p>FROM an Air of impreſſive Earneſtneſs, that is
diſtinguiſhable through this Piece, I am of Opinion, that it was founded on
the real <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0199100801:312"/> Hiſtory of ſome unhappy Woman of the Age
the Author liv'd in, who had the Misfortune to die untimely by her Lover's
Inſenſibility; or, rather, by his Ingratitude.—I pleaſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with an Imagination, that this <hi>Sonnet</hi> might be one of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s. A hundred worſe are imputed to him: And there is his
peculiar, ſolemn Power to touch this <hi>Church-Yard Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> very
viſible in the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> of this Ballad.</p>
            <p>BUT, whoever the Author was, his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appears to have been as
extraordinary as his Genius; as is finely viſible in his Conduct of this
little Poem.—When the Ghoſt has gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in, and ſtands at the Bed's
Foot of the ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lover, had the Speech begun immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Reader
muſt have been hurried too faſt away from the Impreſſion which the
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition was deſign'd to make on him: He is, therefore judiciouſly
detained in this Place by a Deſcription of her Face and Poſture, ſo
ſtrongly painted, that we really ſeem to <hi>ſee</hi> her. And, after a
ſhort Moral Reflection, which follows aptly in the Third Stanza, we are
acquainted, during this artful Interval, with her Character, her Youth, her
Beauty, and the Cauſe of her unhappy Death: And, by that Time we are prepared
to know her, and to pity her, the Speech is open'd with this ſharp and
ſtartling Summons. 
<q> 
                  <l>Awake! ſhe cry'd,—Thy true Love calls,</l> 
                  <l>Come from her Midnight Grave!</l> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0199100801:313"/>BUT nothing was ever juſter, or more
ſtrikingly imagin'd, than his Compariſon of the Ghoſt's Face, to an <hi>April</hi> Sky, (which is, at beſt, but faintly ſhining, and is here
made fainter ſtill, by a ſcattering Cloud that dims it) to the Shadow, as
it were, or thin Reſemblance of a Light not viſible. This is an Image, ſo
true to the Meaning, ſo Poetical, and well-adapted, that it greatly
deſerves Notice: As does alſo, That Clay-cold, Lilly-Hand, that holds up a <hi>ſable Shroud</hi>! The Oppoſition of the Shroud's Blackneſs, to the
Lilly White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Hand, is a delicate and graceful Stroke, and very
judiciouſly heighten'd by that Epithet of <hi>Clay-cold,</hi> which makes us
ſhrink, as if we <hi>felt,</hi> what we <hi>ſee,</hi> ſo very <hi>ſtrongly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO wake us from this Horror, in order to make way for that <hi>Pity,</hi> which he is prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to move in us, we are, by a ſudden, yet
almoſt imperceptible, Tranſition, carried away from what ſhe <hi>is,</hi>
to what ſhe <hi>was,</hi> before Love chang'd her; 
<q> 
                  <l>Her <hi>Bloom</hi> was like the <hi>Morning Flow'r,</hi>

                  <l>That <hi>ſips</hi> the <hi>Silver-Dew.</hi>
                  </l> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I AM charm'd by a Stroke in this ſweet <hi>Simile,</hi> which is
touch'd with ſo much Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that it would go near to eſcape the
Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any Reader, not skill'd in Poetry: I will therefore take
Notice, That her exact Time of Life being directly pointed out by 
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0199100801:314"/> 
               <hi>The Morning Roſe, juſt opening to the View,</hi>
that Expreſſion of <hi>Sipping the Silver-Dew,</hi> is peculiarly juſt
and elegant: For, where a Flower is full blown, the Dew-drops have free
Admiſſion, and are taken in, as it were, by large Draughts; but a budding
Flower, receiving no Moiſture, but on its Edges, is, with the fineſt
Propriety, ſaid to <hi>ſip</hi> it.</p>
            <p>A SECOND excellent <hi>Simile</hi> is, That where he compares a
ſecret Love in a Woman's Heart, to the Canker-worm in a Bud, that fades and
deſtroys it: And this, again, has the Air of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> who has
the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion for <hi>Grief</hi> in one of his Tragedies.—There
is ſomething exquiſitely <hi>touching</hi> in that noble Tenderneſs of
her Reproach, in the <hi>Eighth Stanza.</hi>—That <hi>Erotema,</hi> or
Figure of <hi>Queſtioning,</hi> which takes up the <hi>Ninth, Tenth,</hi> and <hi>Eleventh,</hi> is purſued with the moſt pathetick Emphaſis; and, at
laſt, broken off with an <hi>Apoſiopeſis,</hi> ſo natural, and ſo
mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I have ſeldom ſeen a Beauty more diſtinguiſhable. It is
where, after all thoſe paſſionate <hi>Why's,</hi> with which ſhe has
been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding her Lover's Falſhood, ſhe interrupts them, on a ſudden,
with this Self-accuſing Queſtion, which ſtrikes out the <hi>Moral</hi>
too, in a ſurprizing Flaſh of Warning, where it was leaſt to be expected;

<q> 
                  <l>And <hi>why, alas!</hi> did I, fond Maid!</l> 
                  <l>
                     <hi>Believe</hi> the flatt'ring Tale?</l> 
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0199100801:315"/>BUT it were endleſs to particularize the
Beauties of this charming Ballad. The whole may be ſaid to be one continued
Beauty! And, I believe, it will not be poſſible for any ſerious Reader to
peruſe, or hear it, without Emotions in his Blood, that will ſpeak more in
its due Praiſe, than the moſt regular <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> on it.</p>
            <p>IT is a plain and noble Maſterpiece of the <hi>natural</hi> Way of
Writing, without Turns, Points, Conceits, Flights, Raptures, or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of
what Kind ſoever. It ſhakes the Heart by the mere Effect of its own
Strength and Paſſionateneſs; unaſſiſted by thoſe flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ornaments, which as often <hi>dazle,</hi> as <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play,</hi> in Poetry.
This was owing to the Author's Native Force of Genius; For they, who conceive a
Thought diſtinctly, will, of Neceſſity, expreſs it plainly, becauſe,
out of the Words which ariſe, and offer themſelves to embody a Meaning,
they find no Uſe for the Superfluous, but to darken, and confound their
Purpoſe.</p>

into His Majeſty's <hi>Navy</hi>; to the moſt manifeſt Hazard of bringing
a <hi>bad Name</hi> upon many a Ship-full of good Mariners.—What a

            <p>I AM indebted to a little white-headed Son, of my good Landlady, for
the Honour of my Acquaintance with ſo many <hi>Horſes of Quality,</hi> who
are worthy, I make no doubt, of all the Friendſhip that is ſhewn them, by
thoſe grateful Allies, and Confederates, their Maſters. The Boy came up, to
my Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a Petition, and a Paper of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder; which he deſir'd
I wou'd inſtruct him in the Myſtery of making out, into <hi>Crackers:</hi>
And I buſied my ſelf, for half an Hour, with becoming Gravity, and
Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; enjoying all that Pleaſure, which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd I gave my Pupil:
Whoſe Powder being apply'd to the important Uſe which he had bought it for,
the Paper it was wrapt in, happen'd to be left upon my Hands; and ſeems to
have been an Original Letter, from ſome honeſt poor Fellow, of the inferior
Claſs of Horſe-Courſers (if any Certainty, as to his Rank, may be drawn
from his bad Spelling.)—The Beginning was torn off, with the Date, and
Place, it was ſent from: But, what remain'd, was as follows.</p>

our Races <hi>was</hi> to come on, as All <hi>Us Horſes</hi> in the Field
ſtarted together, for a <hi>Breathing.</hi> But mad Work we made, amongſt

before ſhe had run a Stroke: And <hi>Dryboots,</hi> with me upon his Back,

up, till they came, both, to the Gap-ſide, and there, ſtruck out, for the

                  <p>I BELONG to a Club of Friendly Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: And we meet, every <hi>Monday</hi> Night, to diſcourſe of ſuch Things as may entertain, and
improve us, in a way moſt ſuitable to that induſtrious, and unambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Honeſty, which Men of Trade pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to thrive by. But our Diverſion has
been often ſpoil'd by a great Scholar, who is got among us, that makes no
more of <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> than if it were only plain <hi>Engliſh!</hi>—Ever ſince he was introduc'd, he has had all the
Talk to himſelf; but <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0199100801:321"/> was never underſtood, above
Three times from the firſt Night he came into our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He is <hi>Great
Mogul</hi> of our Club, and reigns Abſolute, and without a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry:
Publiſhing his <hi>Edicts</hi> in a Language peculiar to the Throne, and
which, being unintelligible, by any of his <hi>Vaſſals,</hi> can neither be
contradicted, nor diſputed againſt.</p>
                  <p>HE expatiated, laſt Night, with a Stile, unuſually <hi>florid,</hi> on the <hi>Verboſity, Loquaciouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Propenſion to Garrulity,</hi> of a worthy Common-Council-Man, whom we
were commending, for a ready Speaker. And when one of us, by way of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
mentioned my Neighbour <hi>Huſhly,</hi> the Cheeſemonger, as the <hi>ſilenteſt</hi> Man, in <hi>London</hi>; he anſwer'd, <hi>That</hi>
Taciturnity <hi>was a Quality as</hi> ineligible <hi>as Exceſs of</hi>
Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>for it</hi> dehominated <hi>thoſe Perſons who were</hi>

                  <p>IT happen'd, fortunately for the CLUB, that an honeſt Drunken
Officer, belonging to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, was among us upon this
Occaſion.—He was, now, what we call <hi>Half Seas over</hi>; and
ſtar'd at our Man of Oratory, for, a Minute with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Motion! At laſt, he
began to tell him, with the moſt compos'd Face in the World, That he was
charm'd with this Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of diſcourſing with a Gentleman of 
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0199100801:322"/> ſo much <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> and hop'd

ſome <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Manufactures, of <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>reverend
Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology.</hi> Modern Criticks, he ſaid, were undetermin'd about them; but
for <hi>His</hi> Part, he had always maintain'd, That <hi>Chintz, Bullbull,
Morees,</hi> and <hi>Ponabaguzzys,</hi> were of nobler and more generous Uſe,
than <hi>Doorguzees,</hi> or <hi>Nourfurmannys</hi>; not but he held againſt <hi>Byrampauts,</hi> in Favour of <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canees</hi> and <hi>Boralchauders</hi>; Only, he wiſh'd, That

                  <p>THERE was not One, of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, except the grave Banterer
himſelf, but laugh'd out aloud, at this humorous Retribution of the Scholar's
affected Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. He look'd a little out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſate ſilent
for ſome Time. But he ſtarted up, at laſt, with a ſmiling Air of good
Humour: And, filling out a Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, drank the Health of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Officer; and, then, ſpoke to him, as
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.—<hi>Sir, I find myſelf much obliged, and return you my

Two uncommon Pieces of Poetry. The Firſt was written, by <hi>Karaſin,</hi>

            <p>THERE is a Hobby-Horſe, in the World, call'd Nobility by Right of <hi>Birth</hi>; which was the Invention of induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Policy, to entail,
and perpetuate, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But, like Vinegar, from the fineſt Wines, it is ſo
changed, by its Putrefaction, That there is not a ſharper Curſe, among the
Scourges of God's Vengeance, than is inflicted on Mankind, by that ſilly
Thing, called, <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0199100801:327"/> 
               <hi>Pride of Deſcent.</hi> It was
firſt indulged, as a Mark of Merit: But it clings, inſeparably, to the <hi>Line,</hi> after the moſt manifeſt Extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the <hi>Worth,</hi> which it was given for.</p>
            <p>YET, there was both the <hi>Rational,</hi> and the <hi>Generous,</hi>
in that Hope, which ſeems to have been conceiv'd, by the firſt Inventors of <hi>Nobility,</hi> from its Original Inſtitution.—Some Great, and
Powerful Prince, when he had experienc'd a Servant's Courage, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, or
Integrity; and, was willing to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmit thoſe Virtues (after they had been
ſo uſeful to Himſelf) to the future Benefit of His Heirs and
Succeſſors; made it his firſt Care to beſtow, on this able Favourite,
ſuch Lands, and Extent of Revenue, as might place him above the Neceſſity
of concerning himſelf for his Childrens Support in Life. And this left him at
perfect Leiſure, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large, and inſpire, their Minds, till He made them
capable of ſucceeding, as well to his Toils, and Dangers, as to his Honours,
and Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>TO ſtrengthen, yet more, their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo good an End,
They contriv'd this further Means of adding viſible, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Marks;
betokening Honour, Power, and Wiſdom: Such as <hi>Titles, Robes, Rank,
Privileges,</hi> and a Train of Pomps, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. All Theſe they made <hi>Hereditary,</hi> for this weighty, and ſufficient
Reaſon:—Becauſe, It was a natural Hope, that Perſons, who were
exempt from private Wants, ſhould, <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0199100801:328"/> alſo, be
unſubject to private <hi>Baſeneſs.</hi> They would, then, be at Liberty
to enlarge, and exalt, their Thoughts, in Proportion to that High Condition,
which they grew up in the Expectation, and Fore-knowledge of: 'Till they came
to diſdain narrow Principles, and renounce ſelfiſh Purpoſes; ſuch as <hi>Poverty</hi> might have ſeemed to juſtify; but, which could never
correſpond with that Magnificence and diſintereſted Scope of Mind, which
was propos'd to be the Conſequence of ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd an Education,
in a Life ſo happily provided for.</p>
            <p>A NOBLEMAN, the Deſcendant of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anceſtors, when we conſider
him in this Light, ſeems to be One of the Pillars of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Virtue, and the
honour'd Ornament of a Body Politick! And the only Reaſon, why we talk with
Reſpect, or even with Gravity, of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of a Man's Family,
is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, by how many more Succeſſions the Line has continu'd <hi>Noble,</hi> by ſo many more Examples their Virtues are ſuppos'd to have
been fortified; 'till the Practice, and Love of <hi>Glory, Juſtice,
Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> are eſteem'd inherent, in their
very Nature; and their Blood flows down, diſtinguiſh'd, by a kind of <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> which it carries with it.</p>
            <p>BUT, excluſive of this ſingle Conſideration what a ridiculous
Pretence to <hi>Reverence</hi> is the Accident of having been <hi>born, to live
lazily!</hi>—It is Inſolence; in the higheſt Degree, for 
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0199100801:329"/> a <hi>Cypher,</hi> of Rank, and Title, to expect
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, from a Perſon, who is venerable, for his good Qualities,
upon no better a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, than becauſe the <hi>accompliſh'd
Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> is, perhaps, the Son of an honeſt Man, who had nothing to
depend on, but his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; And the <hi>fooliſh Lord</hi> had a Father,
who left him an Eſtate, and a Title, which ſomebody <hi>(a long Time
ago!)</hi> gave a ſturdy, valiant, <hi>Soldier,</hi> to maintain his
Poſterity, till they ſhou'd grow <hi>good for nothing,</hi> and look with
Scorn, at their firſt Founder: Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their empty Glory from the
number'd Ages, which have paſſed, ſince <hi>Merit,</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> could claim a Place, in their <hi>Great Family!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF, in the World, there is a pleaſanter Piece of ſtupid
Impertinence, than ordinary, It is, that conceited and ſatisfied, <hi>Self-Preference,</hi> with which one of theſe <hi>Happy</hi> Creatures
looks down, from his own Sublimity, upon the <hi>Merit</hi> that lies below
him!—But I wonder what he would Anſwer, if, in the Heighth of his
Exultation, <hi>Fortune</hi> ſhou'd take a Freak to whiſper this
Queſtion, in his Ear, 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Pray, my Lord! have you conſider'd, how to</hi>
Deſerve <hi>this fine Diſtinction, which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, without knowing
why?—Are you Honeſter, than your own Steward?</hi> Pretty much upon a <hi>Par.—Are you Braver, than your ragged Couſin?</hi> Oh! no—Not
at all.—<hi>Are you more Pious, than your Chaplain?</hi> Far from it, I
aſſure you.—<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0199100801:330"/> 
                  <hi>Are you Wiſer, or more
Learned, than my Lady, your Lordſhip's Wife?</hi> But a little, if any
thing.—<hi>Are you Richer, than your Banker?</hi> Not ſo Rich, by half
a Plumb.—<hi>Pray, what then may your Lordſhip's Pretenſions be, to
that Reſpect, which you claim from others?</hi>—Why,—you know, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that I was <hi>born to it.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a pleaſant Pretenſion! let us trace it a little
higher.—Why is <hi>This Lord</hi>'s Family of more Dignity than <hi>That
Lord</hi>'s, ſince their Eſtates, and Rank, are Equal? <hi>Oh! there is a
very good Reaſon for That: It is, becauſe His Race is moſt
Ancient.</hi>—Pray, what do you mean by <hi>Ancient?</hi> Was not <hi>Adam</hi> their common Father? <hi>Yes: But This My-Lord has been longer in
Poſſeſſion of Lands, than That My-Lord has.</hi>—So then, the
Caſe, it ſeems, ſtands thus, <hi>Other Mens Acquirements muſt give
Him</hi> DIGNITY, <hi>to whom Other Mens Merit has given</hi> DISTINCTION!</p>
            <p>ANTIQUITY of Name, and Family, is one of the moſt riduculous Things
in Nature, when it is made uſe of, as the <hi>Ground of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours:</hi> There
being nothing more certain, than that the Revolutions of Time and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
have us'd all Families alike. And, were it poſſible to ſee, backward,
into the Obſcurity of paſt Ages, we might pick out <hi>Beggars,</hi> from
our proudeſt Lines; and point at <hi>Princes,</hi> in our humbleſt. This
Nobility, that conſiſts in <hi>Sound,</hi> is an empty, and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical, 
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0199100801:331"/> Grandeur: It is a mere <hi>King of Clubs,</hi> who, as
the Game happens to be, may run away from the <hi>Knave,</hi> and ſee the
ſingle <hi>Ace</hi> a nobler <hi>Card</hi> than <hi>His Majeſty!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I FANCY, that, if I were a <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi>-Cock,
with his ſweeping Wing, erected Neck, and Peer-like Strut, within the Sphere
of his <hi>Barn-door Royalty,</hi> wou'd make me ſick of my boaſted <hi>Quality,</hi> unleſs I had better Claim than my <hi>Pride,</hi> to the
Statelineſs I was diſtinguiſh'd by.</p>
            <p>THE true Uſe of <hi>Titles,</hi> is, That they may ſerve, as
ſhining Lights, to lay open and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate, the ſpacious Chambers of a <hi>Mind well-furniſhed.</hi> But, to a cloſe, and ſordid, Soul, they are
like Torches, which we carry down, to illuminate a ſickly Dungeon: Where they
expoſe, but the more diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, the narrow Cells, bare Walls; and
Dirtineſs.</p>
            <p>THE baſeſt Thing in Nature is, To have <hi>Power</hi> to do <hi>much</hi> Good, without <hi>Will</hi> to do <hi>any.</hi> How contemptible,
then, are they, who, becoming inſolent by Proſperity, think on nothing ſo
ſeldom as the Diſtreſſes of the Miſerable? And, while they were made
No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for this End only, to be active in good Offices, live, for <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and to no better Purpoſe than one of their <hi>Hounds,</hi> or their <hi>ſetting Dogs</hi>?—If a Nobleman, who is
thus declin'd, from the only End of his Inſtitution, can be Author of any
Good, by Effect of his <hi>Example,</hi> it muſt be ſuch an 
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0199100801:332"/> accidental, and involuntary, Service, as was done, of
old, to the <hi>Philoſopher.</hi>—He was ask'd, From whom he learnt, to
be ſo ſteady, in Purſuits of Virtue? 
<q rend="inline">'I learn it, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> from the Perſons
who live <hi>moſt vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi>: For, obſerving what makes them
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable, I ſee plainly what to <hi>ſhun</hi>: And I gueſs, by the <hi>Reverſe,</hi> what it is that I ought to <hi>practiſe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Eaſtern People aſcribe to <hi>Plato</hi> ſeveral excellent
Sayings, which we do not find in his Works: And, among others, they cite this
following. 
<q rend="inline">'<hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Want,</hi> are Two <hi>Clouds,</hi> the fulleſt ſtor'd of any; the Firſt rains <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>Arrogance</hi>; the Second, <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> For, while the <hi>Body</hi> of the Poor is improving into <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Rich is degenerating into <hi>Body.</hi>'</q> It is a pretty Remark: And every Man's Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will
enable him to juſtify it. For how few Publick or Private Improvements have
been owing to our Men of Rank? And how many to the unſatisfied Application of
the Unhappy; who, finding themſelves preſs'd, by uneaſy Circumſtances, <hi>whet</hi> and <hi>urge</hi> their active Talents, 'till Proſperity can
afford them <hi>Leiſure</hi> to be as uſeleſs, as if they were <hi>born
to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is plain, then, That a <hi>Nobleman,</hi> who has no other Merit,
than his Rank gives him, has no Merit at all: And is juſt ſo much more
deſpicable than a <hi>Commoner,</hi> who is equally worthleſs, as the
Duties of his Condition are <pb n="324" facs="tcp:0199100801:333"/> more elevated, and
important. And that <hi>Reſpect,</hi> which is look'd for, by a Lord, <hi>merely as a Lord,</hi> deſerves to be number'd among thoſe Sacrifices,
which we make to Cuſtom, at the Expence of our common Senſe; and to the
Diſhonour of our natural Liberty.</p>
            <p>AN Eſſay Writer, of the laſt Age, who had learnt from tireſome
Experience, That he had, irrecoverably, <hi>loſt</hi> thoſe Years, which he
had ſpent in attending the <hi>Great,</hi> (as they love to hear themſelves
call'd) quitted the Purſuit with a manly Scorn: And having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, for
his Reader's Uſe, That theſe Men make no Friendſhips, but ſuch as are
ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient, either to their <hi>Intereſts,</hi> or their <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi>; he cloſes all, with this Remark— 
<q rend="inline">'I have ſo hearty a Contempt for what is commonly
called <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> that if I did not meet with the Word <hi>Lord,</hi> in a Prayer I repeat daily, I ſhould never name it, but with <hi>Deteſtation!</hi>'</q> And, to allow this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor but common Juſtice,
no Man is ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly, a Tyrant over his own Heart, as he, that humbles
himſelf, to a <hi>Will,</hi> that is too proud to take Notice of it: And
waits on thoſe, from whom he can expect nothing, but what he muſt dearly
pay for, in Guilt, Diſhonour, or Mortification.</p>
            <p>I am pleas'd with a frank Correction, of that peeviſh, and
humourſome, Arrogance, ſo inſeparable from theſe proud Mens Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
as it was given, by a <hi>Syrian</hi> Doctor, <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0199100801:334"/> to one of
the <hi>Caliphs</hi> of <hi>Babylon.</hi> They were Angling, upon the River <hi>Tygris</hi>; and the <hi>Caliph,</hi> growing impatient, becauſe he had
catched nothing, ordered the Phyſician out of his Sight, for he was ſure he
ſhould have no Sport, in Company with one, who was ſo <hi>unlucky.</hi>— 
<q rend="inline">'Nay, but methinks, reply'd the Doctor, you accuſe
me a little raſhly: My Father was a Drawer of Water, and my Mother but a
Slave; yet I have been Chief Favourite of many ſucceſſive <hi>Caliphs,</hi> and am Rich, and Fortunate, beyond my Wiſhes: How then can
ſuch a Man, as I, deſerve to be call'd <hi>unlucky?</hi> But if you would
be inform'd, I can name a Perſon, who may, <hi>truly,</hi> be ſtil'd
unhappy.'</q> The <hi>Caliph</hi> told him, he might explain himſelf. 
<q rend="inline">'—It is, Sir, purſued the Phyſician, a Lord,
who deſcending, lineally, from Four illuſtrious <hi>Caliphs,</hi> and
being, himſelf too, a <hi>Caliph,</hi> ſits, unmindful of his Dignity, <hi>catching Fiſh,</hi> like an idle Saunterer; while <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Reſt,</hi> are ſpreading Nets, to catch <hi>his People.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE Honours were firſt beſtow'd, as a Reward of Mens paſt
Virtues, and for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of their Future, it ſeems the juſteſt Thing
imaginable, That all <hi>Lords,</hi> who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them, fruitleſly,
ſhould <hi>forfeit</hi> them: And ſtep down among the Herd, to hide the
Shame of thoſe Defects, which, by Reaſon of their too high Situation, blaze
out, like a Beacon, to the Diſturbance of a whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. 
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0199100801:335"/> As, (for the ſame Reaſon) where a Nobleman is truly
ſuch, his Wiſdom, his Courage, and his Loyalty, ſtrike out their
Influence in larger Circles, than the Virtues of inferior Ranks can
poſſibly be extended to.</p>
            <p>FOR my Part, as it is my Purpoſe to ſpeak of every Thing like a <hi>Plain Dealer,</hi> I declare with the utmoſt Indifference, That, though
no Man more ſincerely reverences what a Nobleman was meant to be, yet I can
have no Reſpect at all, for the <hi>Name,</hi> where the <hi>Thing</hi> is
wanting. On the contrary, it is my Opinion, That every Gentleman of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſhould deſpiſe, and mortify the Vanity of ſuch a chimerical
Superiority, as would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance itſelf, above <hi>ſubſtantial Honour,</hi>
by the empty Memory and <hi>Sound</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>THE Breath of a Sovereign may have Power to <hi>create Titles</hi>;
But it can have none, to <hi>invert Qualities.</hi> Though the Veſſel is in
the Potter's Hands, and the Man <hi>muſt</hi> be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Noble, <hi>whom the
King delighteth to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> yet, he will never <hi>be ſo,</hi> by his
Patent, if he was not before, ſo, in his Nature.—But there is a Kind of
Man, who, will, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, be found Noble, without Aid of Pomp, or Titles: And,
in what Place ſoever you chance to meet him, you may know him by the
following Marks: He will be Humble in Greatneſs; and Immoveable, in
Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He will be compaſſionate, without Weakneſs; Brave, without

his Anger will have no Malice. He will Love, without Folly: and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
without Hatred. His Hope will be Strong, but Patient: his Fear Awake, but
Eaſy. He will be Active, without Hurry; and at Leiſure, without Idleneſs:

Modeſt Virgins out of Countenance, by ſtaring unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in their Faces.
This Behaviour adds ſo many new Charms, and renders them ſo agreeable to
all they converſe with, that I would gladly aſſume a little of this <hi>Modern</hi> Accompliſhment: But the Prejudice of early imbib'd
Principles, is ſo ſtrong, that, inſtead of anſwering a SMART in his own

                  <p>MOST of our Neighbours, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I have the Honour to be
related to you, have put me upon writing this Letter, to acquaint you, That
Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day a ſtrange and ſurprizing Creature was ſeen to paſs through
our Town on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back: It had the Face of a young Woman, ſtuck full of
Patches; a Perriwig, which hung down to Its Waiſt; a Hat, cock'd with the
Smartneſs of a young Officer; a huge Bunch of Ribbons, faſtened behind Its
Left-Shoulder; a Shirt laid in large <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0199100801:339"/> Pleights on the
Breaſt, and tied cloſe at the Neck and Wriſts, which, with a Veſt of
White Satten, trimm'd with Black, had much the Reſemblance of a Shroud. Our
whole Town was ſoon alarmed with this ſtrange Appearance, and various are
ſtill the Opinions what It really was: The Old Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who were the moſt
couragious generally, went pretty near to It, with their Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles on, to
view It more diſtinctly; the younger Sort kept It at an awful Diſtance:
Some were of Opinion, that It was a High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman in Diſguiſe, and
accordingly were for ſeizing It; others took It for a Nun; but by a certain
arch Lear It had with Its Eyes, I dare engage It had not a Bit of Nun's Fleſh
about It: However, by its pale Complexion, and Shroudlike Dreſs, moſt of my
Neighbours, at laſt, concluded It to be a Ghoſt, and ſo took to their
Heels, and left me, (who am no great Believer in theſe Things) almoſt alone
with It in the Road. I had now an Opportunity. during the Time It was drinking
a Glaſs of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Wine</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> at the <hi>Saracen's-head-Inn,</hi> to ſurvey It well, and thereupon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding It
to be an <hi>Hermaphrodite,</hi> I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Man, who ſeemed to have
the keeping of It, If he intended to ſhew It in our Town? and at what Inn?
for, you muſt know, Sir, that I have a mighty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to ſee one of
thoſe Creatures all over: But the Man, with an angry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, 
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0199100801:340"/> told me, That what I took for an <hi>Hermaphrodite,</hi>
was only a young Lady, and that the Sort of Dreſs ſhe was in, was commonly
worn for a <hi>Riding-Habit</hi> by the Ladies of Faſhion at <hi>London</hi>:
But as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I, nor my Neighbours, can believe it poſſible for Folks,
upon no ill Deſign, to diſguiſe themſelves in ſuch a Manner, I
deſire you will, in one of your PLAIN-DEALERS, (for we have it conſtantly

                  </opener>
                  <p>THE few Lines, I ſent to you, on the 27th of the laſt Month,
were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Diverſion of your Readers, and were the Dictates of a
Mind at Eaſe. I write to you now, with a quite different' 
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0199100801:343"/> Spirit, and on a more ſubſtantial and ſolid
Motive. My Heart was then, ſo light, that I little thought it would, in ſo
ſhort a Time, grow ſo heavy as I now find it. I am in Pain about a very
worthy Relation of ours, young Mr. <hi>Truelove,</hi> who, being juſt
return'd from his Travels, is married to a young Lady, upon whom he had
ſecretly ſet his Heart for ſome Years before he went Abroad. The
Perplexity of the Caſe is, That he has married her, without the Knowledge of
his Father, and that the good old Gentleman, without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Son,
had provided for him a Lady, Beautiful like her, himſelf has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and
young, like her; Equal in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but vaſtly Superior in Point of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Never was there a more Paternal Affection, than my Uncle <hi>Truelove</hi> has
ſhewn innumerable Marks of to his Son; nor were there ever more Tokens of
Filial Piety, than my Couſin has taken all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to demonſtrate
towards his Father. It would be a wonderous Pity, that any Miſunderſtanding
ſhould happen between ſo loving and beloved a Father, and ſo lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and
beloved a Son: And yet we are all in mighty Apprehenſions, that this
Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age may occaſion a fatal Breach between them. The Father placed the
Proſpect of the Son's Happineſs in his having a Wife with a plentiful
Fortune. The Son thought that, with Regard to his own Happineſs, 
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0199100801:344"/> no Fortune could be put in Competition with the Value of
the Woman, whoſe Virtue, Beauty, and Innocence, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd her to his
Heart. The Father (if all our Family gueſſes right, and much I fear we do)
will be inraged at the Loſs of an Eſtate, in which he had imaginarily
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the whole Sum of his Son's Felicity in this World; he will tax him of
Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, tell him he has thrown himſelf away, and call this Marriage ſo
enter'd upon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Knowledge or Conſent, an Act of Diſobedience. My
Couſin, who bears a tender and an affectionate Heart, will ill brook theſe
Rebukes, that make his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem to undervalue the precious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whom he, above all the World, holds dear; he will not, he cannot, ſuffer
them. He will juſtify his Choice; He will be warm in the Defence of the Fair
One his Father has deſpiſed; He will ſpeak with Indifference of the
Fortune; his Father had with Pains been ſeeking, in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her, and
maintain the Privilege of his being of Age, and free to chuſe for himſelf.
Thus their very Affections, by this different Notion, they have of
Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, may be the Cauſes of their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and ſince thoſe,
who have a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the Paſſion of Love, carry with them that Violence
into other Paſſions, we are apt to fear, that, unleſs ſome Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be taken, the Rupture may be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0199100801:345"/> and we rather
think, by gentle Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, to break the Force of the Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in the
Manner of diſcovering the Marriage to the Old Gentleman, than leave him to
the Chance of a haſty Fury, upon his ſuddenly diſcovering it himſelf.
We are all on the Son's Side, before the Matter breaks out; and we have a Mind
to make it up with the Old Gentleman, as it were without his own Knowledge. Our
Contrivance is, what I am ſure your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity will prompt you to help
forward; that you ſhould pen a Paper, in Defence of the Right which young Men
have of chuſing for themſelves, and againſt the Hardſhip there would be
in a Father's interpoſing his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt the Inclinations of his
Son, in the Caſe of Marriage, and after we have read that to him, we will
open it by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Though it is more particularly ours at preſent, yet it
is the World's Concern: The Young of both Sexes will be pleaſed with the
Speculation, and it may be very extenſively beneficial. If that Fatherly
Gentleman, that wiſe Companion of yours, the Major, joins with you in
ſupporting the Cauſe of the young People, two ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities will be
of great Weight with the old Ones, and, at leaſt reconcile them ſo far to
this general Opinion of all Children, that when ſuch Accidents happen, they
will not ſtand in need of ſo many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to reconcile them to their
Perſons. <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0199100801:346"/> In complying with this, you will give great
Eaſe and Satisfaction to our whole Family, and particularly to,</p>

            <p>WHEN this Letter came to my Hands, the Major happened to be preſent,
and as ſoon as I had look'd it over, I told him, He had a Right to read it;
he did ſo, and returning it with a Smile, <hi>Your Kinſwoman</hi> (ſaid
he) <hi>makes a very reaſonable Requeſt</hi>; The Old People, who are
generally in the Right, when they differ from the Young, will not be angry with
us, their Coaevals and Well-wiſhers, if we ſhould endeavour to ſhew, that
the young People are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in the Wrong in this Point. <hi>For my
ſhare, I muſt frankly declare, That, when young People are at Years of
Diſcretion before they marry, the Law of Nature and Reaſon, ſeems to
ſpeak them Free to chuſe for themſelves, ſince they, and not their
Parents, for no leſs a Term than Life, are to enjoy the</hi> Happineſs <hi>of a</hi> Right <hi>Choice, or feel the</hi> Smart <hi>of a</hi> Wrong <hi>one.</hi> The Major and I agreed in this Sentiment, and had a long
Diſcourſe upon <pb n="338" facs="tcp:0199100801:347"/> the Subject, which, when I got Home,
threw me into the following Reflections.</p>
            <p>OF all the Affections, which move and act pleaſurably upon the Frame
of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Plato</hi> reckons Love the moſt deſirable: <hi>For
He,</hi> ſaith this curious Philoſopher, <hi>who is thoroughly affected
with this Paſſion, removes his Soul to the Place, where he has ſettled
his Affections, and loſes Himſelf to find the Object he doats upon.</hi>
This pleaſant Straying, this delightful Wandering of the Soul from its own
Manſion, is a beautiful Deſcription of the Force of Love, and the Power,
which thoſe, who were created to charm, have to tranſport us, as it were,
from the Government of Ourſelves, into their own abſolute Dominion. A
Paſſion, which is, of its own Nature, ſo violent, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Men
excuſable, in a great meaſure, when they ſeem to miſplace it: They
cannot be ſaid to be guilty of a Fault in diſobeying their Relations, when
they are tranſported beyond the Power of giving Law to themſelves. They are <hi>ſunk in the ſoft Captivity,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, are not free Agents:
Neither is it hard it ſhould be ſo in Nature; on the contrary, as good and
virtuous Women, alone, have the <hi>full</hi> Power of moving and captivating
the Soul in the manner I mention, it is ſo far from being an Evil, that it is
a Bleſſing to be highly coveted. The Man, who is born of a good Mother,
ſays little enough, when, tranſported by her Deſert, he calls Women the
Ornaments of Mankind in their <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0199100801:348"/> Proſperity, and their
Supports in Adverſity; There is no being happy in Life without them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PLATO,</hi> in another Place, has carried the Sentiment to a more
agreeable Height, he ſays, <hi>The Soul of a Man, in Love, dieth in his own
Body, and liveth in anothers.</hi> This is Energy of Expreſſion; and yet
there is not more of Strength and Delicacy, than of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and
Juſtneſs: For, the Soul of a Man in Love, is dead to all other Appetites.
The Man, who was in Love with Riches, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the Purſuit of Honour,
before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Fair One, who captivated his Soul, the Moment his Heart
confeſſes itſelf a Victim to the Enchantment of Beauty, looks no longer
upon Honour and Riches as the Two principal Movements, they grow only
ſecondary Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and are no farther valued than as they may help him
to comfort, and adorn the adored Companion of his Life. Love is really, witn
regard to other Affections, what the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's Stone is pretended to be,
with regard to Metals: It inriches, and ennobles every Thing it touches: It is
the genuine Elixir, that gives a golden Tincture to every Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of
the Mind; it heightens Ambition; it inlarges Generoſity; it quickens Joy; it
baniſhes Envy; it extinguiſhes Luſt; it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens the Virtues, and
extirpates the Vices of Men in all Ranks and Conditions of Life. Is there a
King, who is a Lover of Money? The Beauty whom he languiſhes to make a 
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0199100801:349"/> Queen, is valued beyond all his Treaſure: Is there a
Courtier that is warm in the Purſuit of a Coronet? Let him be in Love, and
his Miſtreſs is his <hi>Pride</hi>: Without her, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet will not
hinder his Head from aching: A <hi>Garter</hi> will leſs aſſuage the
Swellings of his proud Heart, than a <hi>Favour</hi> of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing. A Man
that has a Fulneſs of Joy in his Compoſition, will grow melancholy, if he
loſes the fair Object of his Deſires; Muſick cannot pleaſe where her
Voice is not heard: Equipage, Embroideries, and Brocades are falſe Colours
upon the Heart that is inwardly in Mourning. The Envious Man envies no Body but
his Rival, while he continues a Lover. The Luſtful forgets his Appetites
after Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Women. What Parent can ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally expect to be heard, when
he undertakes to plead againſt ſuch powerful Impreſſions? All the
Urgings of Duty will be of no Effect; all the Arguments that can be uſed,
will be no Arguments to theſe; all the World, beſide his Miſtreſs, is
nothing to the Man that is in Love, and She is all the World to him.</p>
            <p>WHAT can they hope to propoſe to a Son in this Condition, thar will
deter him from his Purpoſes? Will they propoſe to him a Women, whom they
think more beautiful and agreeable, and that as an infinite Superiority of
Fortune, above the Fair One, that is his own Choice; Let her be as great a
Fortune as ſhe pleaſes, ſhe is no Fortune at all to him: She would be,
with all her Wealth, the Load <pb n="341" facs="tcp:0199100801:350"/> and Calamity of his Life. <hi>Love,</hi> he would ſay, <hi>is built upon the Union of Minds; Hearts are
not to be bribed by Gold, and true Paſſion is not to be bought off by the
Treaſure of both</hi> Indies. He can have no Reliſh in Poſſeſſions,
that his deſired Partner ſhares not. Will they add, That beſides Fortune,
the Miſtreſs they recommend, has infinitely more of Beauty in the World's
Eyes? He will anſwer, The World's Eye is none of his; he will grant, even
that ſhe may have Defects, and will not ſtop to ſay, <hi>That he is even
in Love with thoſe Defects.</hi> In fine, All they can propoſe will never
avail, nor is it, indeed, reaſonable that it ſhould. If they threaten him
with their Diſpleaſure, and tax him with want of Duty, he will tell them,
That he is dutiful in all other Points; he will be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their
Diſpleaſure, but cannot obey in this One Caſe; he will make this
undeniable Quotation in his Defence, That <hi>he is to leave his Father and
Mother, and cleave to his Wife.</hi> And, truly, if his Parents think, that he
ſins againſt Prudence in chuſing a ſlender Fortune, all the World will
judge, that they would ſin againſt Juſtice, if, forcing his
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, they make him Wretched, under Pretence of making him Rich, and
render him Miſerable, under the Colour of making him Fortunate.</p>

            <p>THE Complaint of <hi>CHLOE,</hi> in the enſuing Letter ſeems to be
formed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo laudable a Deſire of making her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band more agreeable to
her, that without being entirely uncomplaiſant, and void of all Gallantry
whatſoever, there is no ſuch Thing as refuſing to inſert it, or denying
her all the Aſſiſtance, that ſuch a Plain Old Man, as I am, ſhall be
able to give her, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards procuring her a proper Redreſs from her
Husband.—It is, indeed, a nice and tickliſh Matter to have any Thing to
do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween married Folks; and, unleſs I had great Hopes of doing good, I
ſhould have little Inclination to meddle in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0199100801:352"/>BUT I remember to have heard a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Caſe once, when a very Reverend Divine was applied to, by both Parties, to
accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate a Difference between them; the holy Man, excuſed himſelf, with
a venerable Shrug, ſaying, <hi>That he had laid it down as a Maxim, Never to
go between a Man and his Wife, on any Conſideration whatever.</hi>—A
Friend of mine, who knew both the Man and the Wife, aſſured me, That the
firſt Grounds of their Difference were too ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to bear being told;
but, that both being very ſtiff and obſtinate not to yield an Inch on
either Side, were, however, inwardly aſhamed, and wanted nothing more
earneſtly than a Pretence to come together by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the
Divine: If the <hi>Doctor</hi> had only uſed <hi>Will. Weathercock's</hi>
healing Method, and ſaid no more, but that, <hi>Tho' both of them had been in
the Wrong, yet both of them were in the Right too,</hi> all would certainly
have come right, and they have been as good Friends as ever.</p>
            <p>FOR this Reaſon therefore, I ſhall never think it a Matter of
Scruple to thruſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a diſcontented Couple. My Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent <hi>CHLOE</hi> complains of a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and viſible Obſtruction, that
is eaſy, and will be even <hi>refreſhing</hi> to her Husband to <hi>take
off,</hi> and I comply with her Deſire of inſerting the Complaint,
becauſe, I confide, that her Husband's Compliance with the Prayer of her
Petition, will be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of mine.</p>

                  <p>THIS very Day makes it exactly Half a Year, ſince I became a Wife.
My Husband, when he made his Applications to me, always appeared Gay, Genteel,
and Debonnair. But, about Two Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had tyed the <hi>Gordian</hi>
Knot, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dreſs in a more negligent Manner. He now appears ſo much
the Reverſe of what he did formerly, in Point of Dreſs, that the Neighbours
look upon it as a bad Compliment to his Yoke-Mate. Before Matrimony, his Chin
was ſcarce ſhaded. But now, the <hi>Barber</hi> is never ſent for but on
a <hi>Saturday</hi> Night. This ſtrange <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis,</hi> you may
naturally ſuppoſe, is no ways agreeable to me. I aſſure you, Sir, I
have ſpared no Pains to prevail with my Deary, to make his Appearance, in a
Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuitable to his Station. However, my repeated Petitions have, all of
them, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ineffectual. I therefore, beg of you, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, to give
me your Aſſiſtance in this Affair, and you will high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige,</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>Your very Humble Servant, <hi>CHLOE.</hi>

            <p>IF the Maxim of the above-mentioned Divine was to be followed in our
preſent Caſe, <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0199100801:354"/> I do not know where this Complaint
might end, and whether it would not come to an open Rupture: It is certain, the
moſt remarkable Divorces have ariſen from as ſmall Beginnings. The very
Letter of this young Lady, ſhews her to be a neat and cleanly Perſon, and
therefore her Complaint of this (I cannot help terming it) <hi>dirty</hi>
Uſage, carries the greater Weight with it. I can, methinks, behold this young
Sloven approaching the tender Thing, and embracing her in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that turns
Pleaſure into a Torment; I ſee him hold her ſtruggling againſt a
Kiſs, his Arms round her unwilling Neck, force her Face to his dreaded Lip;
he is put to the Neceſſity of <hi>raviſhing</hi> a Kiſs from his own
Wife, and yet is ignorant of the Meaning.—He takes it, however, by
Violence.—She looks half pleaſed, half angry, hangs down her Head,
hides the Water in her Eyes, puſhes him, between Jeſt and Earneſt, from
her Boſom; rubs her glowing and ſmarting Mouth, calls him <hi>Rough
Thing!</hi> with half a tender-laughing, and a half-whining Voice.—The
unpoliſh'd Creature caſts a Booby Stare at her, and is ſtupidly at a
Loſs to know why ſhe ſtruggles ſo hard againſt what ſhe likes:
Unleſs he is told, point-blank, That his Beard is the Cauſe of all the
Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he cannot perceive that her Cheeks look red and angry with his
Kiſſes, and wear ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Print of Fury than Love. He muſt be told,
That a delicate Skin was never <pb n="346" facs="tcp:0199100801:355"/> form'd to be bruſh'd
over by a briſtly Beard, that is rough, and ſtubborn, like the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that
lets it grow. I call it more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>ſtubborn</hi> in this
unaccountable young Fellow, for ſhe has told, and told him of it again and
again, in plain Terms, and he, notwithſtanding all this, pertinaciouſly
conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to go <hi>rough.</hi> Now is it not a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way of acting,
after all, that when a <hi>Lover,</hi> he ſhould ſhave cloſe, for fear of
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Eye of a Miſtreſs whom he was uncertain of obtaining; and
yet let it grow, when a <hi>Husband,</hi> without having the Fear of wounded
Beauty before his Eyes; and without any Apprehenſions of hurting that Face by
his Roughneſs, that charm'd him by its Softneſs.</p>
            <p>I DWELL the more upon this Subject, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable as it may
ſeem to ſome, becauſe it is a Male Vice that I have frequently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Notice of, and as often wiſh'd to ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied for the ſake of the fair
Sufferers, who are wedded to ſuch unpoliſh'd Barbarians. A Marriage
Converſation ought to humanize and temper Men; on the contrary, theſe,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of growing tamer, are made more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage by Matrimony.</p>
            <p>YOU ſhall ſee a Lover in a fine Campaign Peruque, and an
embroider'd Suit of Cloaths, alter'd into a Husband, with an aukward Country
Bob, and a Surtout made out of a Rug. You ſhall find his Manners following
his Dreſs, and his Complaiſance degenerating <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0199100801:356"/> into
Bluntneſs. It is in all Degrees alike. You ſhall ſee one, whom before
Marriage, you would take for a Lord, alter'd, after it, into a Coachman; many
that ſeemed Senators tranſmuted into Jockies; a hundred ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Beaus
turn'd Clowns, and numberleſs Sir <hi>Clements</hi> transformed into Country <hi>Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SURE, as old as I am, I have a more amorous Nature in me ſtill, than
theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious young Fellows, whoſe Affections and Actions are ſo
different, I cannot tell what to make of them. I can eaſily gueſs it would
tickle my Ear ſtrangely, to hear a young beautiful Creature telling me, how I
ſhould become more agreeable to her, by adorning myſelf, and intreating me
to do it. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if <hi>Patty Amble</hi> and I were upon ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Terms of Agreement, There are not any little Cuſtoms, that I would not depart
from for her Eaſe. As fix'd an Averſion as I have profeſs'd againſt
clouded Canes, I ſhould, however, be eaſily perſwaded to carry a painted
Stick, inſtead of an Oaken, if by <hi>walking</hi> with it, I was ſure to
make <hi>Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> in my Wife's Affection; nay, I would admit a <hi>Knot of Ribbons</hi> to it into the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, provided it would render our <hi>Marriage-Knot</hi> the eaſier. Again, I have known Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who have a
prodigious Averſion to a <hi>Mouſe,</hi> and are not only very wary at
guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Petticoats upon the Approach of that little noxious and nimble
Animal, but <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0199100801:357"/> do not even care that any Thing, which looks
the leaſt like it, ſhould come near them: Now, if my <hi>Patty</hi> was of
that Temper, I, who know how far Women are apt to ſtretch ſome Antipathies,
would alter the very Colour of my Gloves for fear of Offence; and though I have
affected <hi>Mouſe-colour</hi> for ſo many Years, I would fit myſelf with
a Pair of White, or, at leaſt, of a leſs frightful Complexion, before I
would come within Arm's Length of her Hoop. In fine, tho' I wear a little <hi>Muſtache</hi> (the Faſhion when I was young, and a Peculiarity I have
not mentioned of myſelf 'till this Day) that would rather tickle than offend,
yet ſooner than that ſhould interpoſe, it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the
Edge of the Razor. For I am abſolutely for reſcinding the leaſt
Obſtacles between a Man and his Wife, before Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are carried too
far.</p>
            <p>A GREAT many People will object, that theſe are Trifles; but I
ſay, They are Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that have more Conſequences than they dream of.
However, granting the Objection true, if conforming one's-ſelf in little
Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is ſufficient to pleaſe, it is the leaſt a Man can do, to
indulge ſo amiable a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>COMPLIANCE in Dreſs, is a Piece of Matrimonial Wiſdom, <hi>Fine
Feathers making fine Birds:</hi> Women often chuſe more judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly than
the Men; and have Regard to <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0199100801:358"/> Senſe, Temper, and
Behaviour, but they will have a Mixture of Appearance too, in the Compoſition
of their Man, if poſſible; and Dreſs paſſes, with ſome of them,
even beyond Looks; inſomuch, that though Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, in the general Rule, be the
Glory and darling Paſſion of a Woman, yet there are Exceptions of many, who
would rather ſee their Husbands fine, than themſelves. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more
common, than to hear <hi>ordinary</hi> Women, eſpecially, who, after they are
mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, are very free in declaring the Source of their Affections, ſay,
That the Neatneſs of her Husband, the Smugneſs of his Look, and the
Cleverneſs of his Shape, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> firſt made her in Love with him.
If this be the Caſe, when the Cauſe ceaſes, the Effect will ceaſe too:
The Moment he grows dirty, wears a long Beard, or drowns himſelf in a large <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the pleaſant Picture, that his Wife had painted of him,
in her Fancy, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes; and if not re-imprinted ſometimes, her Liking
inſenſibly wears away. In fine, as much Trifles as theſe are, a Wife's
Heart, if <hi>that</hi> be a Trifle, is loſt by the Diſuſe of them; and
perhaps made a <hi>trifling</hi> Preſent of, to a Stranger that minds
Dreſſing.</p>
            <p>I HAVE been credibly informed, That it is a political Piece of
Cunning, among thoſe unlucky Sparks, who affect to ſhine by the Means of
modiſh Wickedneſs, to obſerve, how the Husband, who grows careleſs
after Marriage, appeared in the Times of his <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0199100801:359"/>
Courtſhip, and to equip themſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. They Play the Part of the <hi>Suiter</hi> ſo well upon the <hi>Husband,</hi> as to eſtrange from him
the Affections of his Spouſe, and transfer them to their proper Purpoſe.
They dreſs in the ſame Manner, wear Cloaths of the ſame Colour, are
punctual in his very Pinch and Cock of the Hat, mimick his Air, Gait, Mien, and
by this Policy in Love, make the Husband his own Rival. But as the Face is the
Mart of Love, ſo theſe Inconveniencies happen moſtly from an Over-neglect
of that Part; the being not ſhaved ruffles a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Temper againſt her
Husband; while the Gallant, by being trimm'd, ſmooths a Paſſage to her
Inclination.</p>
            <p>I AM ſure, if the Caſe ſtands thus, a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is an Artiſan of
Importance, ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides taking off the <hi>Beard,</hi> he lops away
ſuch growing Evils.</p>
            <p>LET Him, therefore, that values his Head, look to his Beard; and be
mindful.</p>

            <p>EVER ſince I was a School-Boy, I have been fond of walking in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> where, when my Heart is heated, by the Violence
of ſome unruly Paſſion, I enjoy a cool Compoſure, and a kind of
Venerable Refreſhment.—Its dusky Cloiſters, majeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Iſles,
Quire, Organs, Royal Tombs, and reverend Variety of ſtrong, impreſſive,
Images, have a never-failing Power to <hi>reduce</hi> my Mind from Tranſport,
when Hope, Proſperity, or Pleaſure, have betray'd it into Vanity; or, to <hi>relieve</hi> it, when diſorder'd, by a Weight of Anguiſh, or
Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DEATH, and the Sun,</hi> ſays a <hi>French</hi> Writer, <hi>are
Two Things not to be look'd upon with a ſteady Eye.</hi>—Though there
is ſomething in his Obſervation, rather pretty, than juſt, yet ſo far
is certainly true, That we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualify'd <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0199100801:361"/> to think,
ſerenely, on our <hi>Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> while we are ſurrounded by the
Noiſe, and Hurry of the World, in its ambitious Scenes; or ſoften'd into
ſenſual Wiſhes, by the Languor of an idle Solitude.—While <hi>we</hi> are Part of our own Proſpect we can never view it juſtly: But,
in ſuch a Situation as the <hi>Abbey,</hi> we are plac'd as it were, out of
our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and, from this ancient <hi>Stand</hi> of Death, look back upon a
Country, which we ſeem no longer to have any Concern in; and which, therefore
we can judge of with the neceſſary Clearneſs and Impartiality.</p>
            <p>THE Mind that is ſtedfaſt enough to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, calmly, on Death,
will be arm'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Strength, and the Flattery, of human

            <p>I WAS preſent, very lately, when of thoſe Monumental Hiſtorians,
whoſe Imployment it is to draw a Profit from reading Lectures, on theſe
Reſting Places of our antient Princes, was ſhewing the Tomb of <hi>Henry
the Fifth,</hi> to a Circle of Holiday Strollers.—After having inform'd
the taſteleſs Wonderers, That this was <hi>He</hi> who <hi>conquer'd</hi>
France! That His <hi>Son</hi> was <hi>crown'd</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi>! That he
married <hi>the French King's Daughter</hi>! And what elſe he had been Able
to collect from the Records of this great Prince's Reign; he pointed to a
Plain, Wooden, Worm-eaten, Coffin, that was plac'd upon the Ground, by this
Tomb's Side, and told them, That it contain'd the Body of Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> the beautiful Wife of this Triumphant <hi>Henry.</hi>—Adding, That for a ſmall, additional, Contribution, he
would unlock the Coffin, and let them look in upon her Corpſe, which lay
there, perfect, and undecay'd, though ſhe had been dead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Three
hundred Years. They had Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity enough to pay the Price demanded, and the
Propoſer made good his Promiſe, unveiling to their Sight, and Touch, the
Reliques of that Royal Charmer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:0199100801:364"/>I CANNOT expreſs the Indignation, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
which this Scene gave me.—Her lovely Limbs, which, once, were thought too
ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the Wind to blow upon; and which were never ſeen without Joy,
Reverence, and Wonder, by the Conqueror of Her Father's Kingdom, and the
Sovereign of This in which ſhe died: <hi>Now,</hi> lay neglected, and
expos'd! denied even Earth to cover her! and made a Spectacle, for
Entertainment of a Croud of common Wanderers!</p>
            <p>SUPERIOR, as this Lady was, in her Beauty Birth, and Fortune, what
Prae-eminence in Death have all theſe given her above the <hi>Meaneſt,</hi>
and moſt <hi>Unlovely?</hi>—After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made her <hi>Life</hi> a
changeful Courſe of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Calamity, they left her deſtitute, in <hi>Death,</hi> without the Decency of a <hi>Grave</hi> to <hi>ſhelter</hi>
her!—There, now, ſhe lies, a Proof of tranſitory Greatneſs! To
comfort the <hi>Wretched,</hi> with this Reflection, when they look in upon her
expos'd Remains, that <hi>Nature</hi> has made no Difference between a <hi>Royal,</hi> and a <hi>Vulgar,</hi> Body; But, that, taking away what was
added by <hi>Fortune,</hi> each, from the Moment of Death, is the other's Equal
to Eternity.</p>
            <p>WHAT Rank, or Condition, is there among us, which may not draw, from
this great School of Moral Reaſoning, ſome Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their
Benefit?—Even the <hi>Unwary</hi> and <hi>Extravagant,</hi> whoſe Lives
are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Luxury! and to whom the Miſeries <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0199100801:365"/> of <hi>Debt</hi> appear remote, and without Terror! Even <hi>They,</hi> may find a
Leſſon among theſe <hi>Tombs</hi>; for there they may be ſhewn the
Bodies of great Men, doing Penance in their Velvet Coffins, and <hi>impriſon'd after Death,</hi> to ſatisfy the Malice of their ſtubborn
Creditors, as if the Influence of ſordid Money could extend its Cruelties
beyond Life, and had a Privilege to diſturb, by Avarice, the ſleeping
Aſhes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Sovereigns!</p>
            <p>IS a Man inſulted? wrong'd? betray'd? Does he hate his
diſtruſted Enemy? Are his Thoughts imploy'd on Revenge? And does he break
his Sleep with Stratagems, to avoid, or retaliate, the Injuſtice that may be
done him? Let him walk with me in this inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive Circle, and I will ſhew
him the Duſt of a murder'd Monarch, mixing quietly with <hi>his</hi> who
murder'd him.—I will tread with him over Earth that is paſſive, and
ferments not, though compos'd of united Atoms from the mingl'd Bodies of
thoſe Men, whoſe bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling Intereſts and Affections, while they <hi>liv'd,</hi> ſhook the Kingdom like an Earthquake!—When the <hi>Quarrelſome</hi> conſider <hi>This</hi> they ought to bluſh at their
little Hatreds, and grow aſham'd to let their Souls be divided by
Animoſity, when Death may crumple their Bodies together, and incorporate them
with their moſt malicious Enemy!</p>
            <p>THERE is no Fortune ſo <hi>exalted,</hi> but it may find a <hi>Check</hi> in this dark Manſion: Nor any Condition ſo <hi>dejected,</hi> but that it may <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0199100801:366"/> be ſure of a <hi>Comfort</hi>: Every Stone that we look upon, in this Repoſitory of paſt
Ages, is an <hi>Entertainment,</hi> and a <hi>Monitor.</hi>—I never leave
its venerable Gloom, without finding my Mind cooler, and more compos'd than
when I enter'd.—I ſink deep into myſelf, and ſee my Heart without
Diſguiſe; in its good, or evil Propenſities: And I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Power from
theſe ſtrong Impreſſions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Pleaſure, Pride, Ambition, or
low Avarice: And to fortify the Impulſes of Humility, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
Charity, and the Virtues of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Quietude.</p>
            <p>THERE was publiſh'd, a few Years ſince, a Poem, call'd
WESTMINSTER-ABBEY. I am ſorry the Author's Name was not printed with it.
There is ſomthing highly elevated in his Genius, that is ſweetly ſerious,
and ſublimely melancholy!—The Verſes inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, I am indebted
for to that Poem: And I ſhall borrow from the ſame Piece, theſe
following, which, I will take the Liberty to affirm, are as fine ones, as were
ever written.—I ask Pardon for a Tranſpoſition, and Alteration, or
Two, which I have only made, that I might have the Pleaſure of collecting
into one view, as many of the Beauties, as could poſſibly be drawn together
in the narrow Compaſs of my Paper.</p>

                  <p>I Am an old Man, as you are, and when I reflect on the fantaſtick
Viciſſitude of human Affairs; when I conſider the Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life,
and the ſmall Pretenſions I have to any longer Share in it, it fills my
Mind with ſomething grave, ſolemn, and, I muſt own, melancholy; but when
I give my Thoughts a more unbounded Scope, and paſs over that ſhort
Intermiſſion of Life, into the Contemplation of an Eternal 
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0199100801:370"/> Being, my Mind recovers from that Gloom, which the
firſt Reflection fill'd me with, and grows gay, in Proportion to the
Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which this latter has upon it.</p>
                  <p>I WAS, laſt Night, reading that celebrated Speech of <hi>Cato</hi>
whence I have taken the Motto, with which I head this Letter, and whether it
was from the ſerious Thoughts which that Soliloquy inſpired, or the laſt
ſtrong Glimpſes of a Mind almoſt expiring, and habituated to ſuch
Speculations, I am not able to determine; but I was no ſooner fallen
aſleep, than the following Dream, or rather <hi>Viſion,</hi> grew into
Form, and fill'd my Fancy.</p>
                  <q> 
                     <p>METHOUGHT the dreadful Hour was come, in which I was to reſign
this Life; my Bed was ſurrounded by a ſilent Company of weeping Friends,
whoſe Sorrows touch'd me more, than my own approaching Diſſolution, which
happen'd in leſs Time, than human Nature can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and therefore (though
at that Period I felt it ſenſibly) it is impoſſible I ſhould now
deſcribe it. I was no ſooner freed from the Incumbrance, and Obſcurity,
of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but my Soul became refined to ſuch an infinite Degree of
Conception, that my Eyes, having nothing to interrupt, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine their View,
were ſtrengthen'd with ſuch piercing Beams, that they darted every Glance
through an innumerable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion <pb n="362" facs="tcp:0199100801:371"/> of Worlds, and
illuminated me with a particular, and perfect, Knowledge of the Harmony, and
Fabrick of each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Syſtem.</p> 
                     <p>WHILST I was thus loſt in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation (for infinite Spare, like
an endleſs Source, ſtill afforded me new Objects to nouriſh that
inextinguiſhable Thirſt of Knowledge, which is the Employment of Eternal
Life) I felt a Heavenly Tranſport, which diffus'd itſelf, ſwifter than
Thought, through the Frame of my new Being; and which, at the ſame Time it
made my Soul tremble with its Influence, invigora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and enabled it to
ſupport the Energy.</p> 
                     <p>I NOW enjoy'd perfect Felicity, and whilſt my Soul (whoſe
Deſire of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge increaſed in proportion with its Power to gratify it)
imploy'd each different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in purſuit of that Branch, which which
was peculiar to its Nature; on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, I heard an univerſal Crack, which
ſeem'd to ariſe from the whole Number of created Worlds, and reſounded
from Globe to Globe, with a long Continuance of rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated Uproars.</p> 
                     <p>AT laſt, the Chain that link'd them in that dependant Order, in
which, from the firſt Moment of their Creation, they have perpetually been
moving, ſhiver'd, of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The looſen'd Orbs, thus diſunited, began
to roll, with an unconceivable Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, through the vaſt Expanſe of
Space, <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0199100801:372"/> and met, and ſhock'd each other in the dark
Vacuity! The <hi>Sun,</hi> now robb'd of Light, whirl'd rapid, and irregular!
The <hi>Moon</hi> let looſe her Seas, and rain'd a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge in her falling!
The <hi>fixed Stars,</hi> that, from the Birth of Time, had kept their
appointed Stations, no longer aw'd by the all-powerful <hi>Word,</hi> broke
looſe, and ruſh'd together. Prodigious was the Sound! and horrible the
Conflict! The Elements, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting their reſpective Qualities, and urg'd by
the immutable Decree, met, all, and <hi>mix'd,</hi> and loſt themſelves, in
ruinous Confuſion.</p> 
                     <p>WHEN all ſeem'd bury'd in profoundeſt Darkneſs, the wild
Uproar ceas'd at once; and as I wonder'd at this ſudden Silence, a Pyramid of
Fire broke thro', that in a Moment, enwrapp'd the Whole, and, having nothing
left to prey upon, at length, devour'd it ſelf.</p> 
                     <p>THUS was the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>All!</hi> When from that
inacceſſible Brightneſs, where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence conceals, yet makes
it ſelf known, a Beam of Day ſhot out, which lighting up the infinite
Extent of Heaven, and rendering it tranſparent, diſcover'd all its Glories.
I there perceiv'd the Stream of Life, which running through the midſt of
Heaven, <hi>quicken'd</hi> where-ever it roll'd, and watering the Tree of
Knowledge, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd it eternally: Next, I ſaw numberleſs Swarms of
Beings, like myſelf, that fill'd <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0199100801:373"/> the Vaſtneſs of
Infinitude, and ſeem'd loſt, like me, in Wonder, Praiſe, and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I heard a Voice (which had more Influence, than the moſt perfect Harmony of
human Art, and communicated itſelf to all alike) cry, <hi>Come, Eat of the
Tree of Knowledge, and Drink of the Water of Life.</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p>IMMEDIATELY the Angelick Hoſt, and all the Children of Earth (who,
by Obedience to this Command, were become one, and the ſame) eat, and drank,
as they were commanded. The firſt Effect of this, that I found on myſelf,
and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in all the reſt, was a perfect Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of whatever I had
done ſince my firſt entering into Life: Various were the Conſequences!
The <hi>Ungrateful,</hi> the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,</hi> the <hi>Miſer,</hi> the <hi>Falſe Friend,</hi> and the <hi>Rebel,</hi> remember'd, with Horror, their
paſt Crimes, and grew frantick, at every Thought, with the
Conſciouſneſs of what they had merited. They felt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Pangs
of that moſt lively of all Torments, <hi>Deſpair</hi>; but the <hi>Juſt,</hi> and thoſe who had the leaſt to reproach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with, found, yet, they had too much to anſwer for, when, in the Book of
Record, which was thrown open to the View of all, they perceived, that the
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteſt of their Thoughts were regiſtered.</p> 
                     <p>NOW we all became ſenſible, how eaſy the Rule was by which we
were to have <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0199100801:374"/> liv'd; and how adapted to the required
Obedience of human Nature! Whilſt we were thus lamenting our unhappy States,
and aggravating our Miſery by Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, in an Inſtant, we
diſcover'd a fiercer Blaze of Light, and beheld the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Veil drawn
off, that ſhrouded the Almighty's Preſence: Raiſed on a Throne, to which
the Brightneſs of the Sun would have been dim, the Divine Father of all
Things diſclos'd Himſelf; His Countenance was mildly aweful; Paternal
Tenderneſs ſhone out in every Feature of His Face, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a
Concern for us, which, we knew, proceeded from a Divine Idea, <hi>That if He
ſhould be Merciful, He muſt be more than Juſt.</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p>ON His Right Hand ſat the <hi>Second Perſon,</hi> our known <hi>Redeemer</hi>; In Him, the Beauty of the Father was divinely manifeſted;
In Him, the Glory of His Power at once was ſoften'd, and exerted. Behind Him
the fatal Figure of that Croſs, on which He ſuffer'd, hung, like a
dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Comet, prognoſticating the Hour of Judgment. On the Left, was
placed the <hi>Third</hi> Adorable Perſon, in the, now, no longer <hi>Myſtick Union.</hi> In Him, an equal Mixture of the Father, and the Son,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd itſelf, uniting, in his Countenance, the ſevereſt Glory of the
One, with the moſt ineffable Sweetneſs of the Other.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0199100801:375"/> BENEATH, and on the Right of the World's
triumphant Saviour, ſat his Twelve Diſciples: Their Eyes were fix'd on
their great Maſter's Looks, and ſeem'd to borrow thence, by Reflection, all
their Softneſs, and their Luſtre. In equal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on the Left of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd thoſe Antient <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who,
through the Dusk of Superſtition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, by the Light of Reaſon, and
mere Nature, ſaw, and taught, One True, Eternal God; and in Defence of that
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, had Courage even to ſuffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p> 
                     <p>WHILST I contemplated this Divine Appearance, I heard a Voice,
which, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thence, pierc'd the profoundeſt Space of Heaven,
proclaming, <hi>That each ſhould be his own Judge, and from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his own Conſcience, acquit, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn himſelf.</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p>IMMEDIATELY all the <hi>Juſt,</hi> and thoſe whoſe

               <date>FRIDAY, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 21. 1724.</date>
            </head>
            <p>I was viſited, ſome Days ago, by ſeveral of my diſtinguiſh'd
Friends; and, on this Occaſion, muſt particularly name the <hi>Major,</hi>
and <hi>Ned Volatile,</hi> in regard they were the principal Perſons
concerned in that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon's Converſation, which gave Birth to this Day's
Paper.</p>
            <p>THE Diſcourſe turn'd upon a Subject, to which a late unhappy
Rencounter furniſh'd too many Materials: 'Twas the Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Two
dear and inſeparable Friends, which ended not, but with the Life of one of 
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0199100801:378"/> them. The Perſonal Acquaintance, that ſome of us had
with one, or both, of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, continued our Converſation longer, and
carried our Reflections farther, than we ſhould elſe have allow'd of, at a
Time, when we met to give, and receive a mutual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Point of Honour,</hi> which is uſually the Foundation, upon
which theſe unhappy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes are grounded, was, by the <hi>Major,</hi>
beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully explain'd, and ſet in a juſt Light, oppoſite to the too
generally miſtaken Notions of that noble Qualification; and which <hi>Ned</hi> had too warmly debated, 'till <hi>Will. Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock</hi> diverted
his puſhing it to Extremity, by the ſeaſonable Interpoſition of his
peculiar Judgment. <hi>Will's</hi> Deciſions, as the <hi>Pagans</hi> painted
their <hi>Janus,</hi> always appear with <hi>Two Faces,</hi> which favour both
Parties, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them in good Humour. Nevertheleſs, we could not leave
the Subject intirely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Progreſs of Reflection upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of
ſudden Startings, and ungovernable Paſſions, which are too much indulg'd,
and but too little provided againſt, by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind.</p>
            <p>I REMEMBER 'twas agreed to, that moſt of the ill Blood, Debates, and
Quarrels, that happen, owe their Original to Unconcern, and Careleſneſs
about our Humour in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. A Man muſt be Maſter of himſelf, and
preſerve a watchful Guard over his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in Company, if he would either <hi>pleaſe,</hi> 
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:0199100801:379"/> or be <hi>pleaſed.</hi> There is a
natural Liberty, which all Mankind claims by Right; but the miſtaken Uſe of
it leads to Miſchief. A li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, or rambling, Tongue proves, as
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to Society, as Treaſon to a State; and Traitors ſmart no more,
frequently, for <hi>This Guilt,</hi> than Prattlers for <hi>That
Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>NED VOLATILE,</hi> not yet quite cool, broke in upon our Chain of
Reaſoning, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, 
<q rend="inline">'That a ſtrict Watch over one's Words, Actions, and
Humour, in all Companies, is a Reſtraint, which, in his Opinion, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
nothing from Torture. What! ſaid he, muſt I be always under the Slavery of <hi>thinking</hi> before I ſpeak? Shall I never have the Pleaſure of
expreſſing my own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Who would ſacrifice his natural Rights, to
pleaſe another Man? Would any but a <hi>Fool,</hi> or <hi>Flatterer,</hi>
praiſe what he <hi>hates</hi>? or declare himſelf an Enemy to what he <hi>loves,</hi> merely to ſhew his <hi>good Humour,</hi> or <hi>Complaiſance?</hi> No Gentlemen, I maintain, That <hi>Grandeur
itſelf,</hi> would be too dear bought at this Priee; and whoever affirms the
contrary, is no Friend to <hi>Plain-Dealing.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>HE paus'd here, and look'd at me for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; I was going to
diſtinguiſh, and remark the Circumſtances that ſhould be punctually
regarded, when the <hi>Major</hi> begg'd to be heard. 
<q rend="inline">'The Reſtraint, ſaid he, that you repreſent ſo
dreadful, gives more Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, than Pain. Your Complaiſance, 
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0199100801:380"/> and good Humour, is more your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, than
your, Companion's. Is it not for your own Sake, that you accommodate yourſelf
to his Humour, from whom you hope good Offices or expect agreeable
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terainment? Do you take for Diſſimulation a Guard of Prudence, which
induces you to ſeem in the Sentiments of a Man, whom you would willingly draw
into yours, when either your Intereſt, or Inclination, requires it? For my
Part, I think you have a Right to applaud yourſelf, when you can enter
agreeably into oppoſite Humours: What induc'd all the Anticents to admire the
pliant Conduct of <hi>Alcibiades?</hi> And why do we <hi>ſtill wonder,</hi>
that a Man could ſo aptly accommodate himſelf to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Manners of
the ſeveral Countries where he liv'd? Nothing was ſo much talk'd of at <hi>Athens,</hi> as his <hi>Eloquence</hi> and <hi>Gallantry.</hi> Among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he was always <hi>feaſting,</hi> and nothing was ſeen
more ſplendid, than his <hi>Dreſs</hi> and <hi>Equipage</hi>; but he
paſs'd over to oppoſite Manners, when he was obliged to go to <hi>Sparta</hi>; for <hi>there</hi> the moſt rigid <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> led
a Life leſs <hi>auſtere</hi> than <hi>Alcibiades.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'<hi>ALCIBIADES,</hi> cry'd <hi>Ned Volatile,</hi> was
an Affector of <hi>Popularity.</hi> His Maxim was like that of a Friend of
mine, <hi>Cum fueris Romae, Romano vivito More.</hi> But, hang it.—I hate
that Suppleneſs of Humour, It may be neceſſary for Embaſſadors and 
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0199100801:381"/> Travellers; but <hi>Ned Volatile</hi> has nothing to do
with it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HE was proceeding, in his uſual Volubility of Speech, when I
interrupted him, in the following Manner.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'I AM ſorry my Friend <hi>Volatile</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
one of the Bleſſings, upon which the Happineſs of <hi>Society</hi> is in
a great Meaſure, founded. The Commerce of Life requires our Regard to Variety
of Humours every Day, and when <hi>Nature</hi> denies the Maſtery, of them,
Men ſhould endeavour to <hi>acquire</hi> it. Who would not <hi>rejoice
with</hi> a Friend, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and happily, married? <hi>Congratulate one</hi>
juſt arrived from his Travels? Or <hi>Condole</hi> with <hi>another</hi> on
the Loſs of an only, and valuable Son? This is no Suppleneſs, no Inequality
of Humour? 'Tis a Sweetneſs, 'tis a Virtue. Tell me; Would not your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in the Preſence of a Gay Prince, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his Pleaſures, appear with a
chearful Countenance? Or, Would you accoſt with a ſmiling Air, a cloudy,
and ſuſpicious, one? No more is it fitting to carry a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into
Company diſagreeable to that which reigns in it, or to diſcover a <hi>Mien</hi> which condemns the Sentiments wherewith the Company is
prepoſſeſſed. In ſhort, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more oppoſite to the Maxims of
Civil Society, than an Opinionative, and Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, Conduct; and he who will
obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow it, is in Danger of never getting new Friends, and even
of loſing his old <pb n="373" facs="tcp:0199100801:382"/> ones. I wiſh I could ſay, That
theſe Duels, and Deaths, we have been ſpeaking of, are not its common
Conſequences.</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'I HAVE heard, and enter into your Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with
Pleaſure, ſaid <hi>Ned Volatile</hi>; but allow me, at leaſt, to affirm,
That one who is thus Maſter of his Temper, muſt never abuſe this Power;
never betray his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in maintaining an Error, or in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Praiſes
to Words or Actions, that he is ſenſible do not deſerve it.</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'RIGHT, anſwered I.—<hi>How</hi> then, ſaid
he, or <hi>wherein,</hi> do you appear Maſter of your Humour?—When I
ſubmit it, replied I, to that of others, or decline my own Will to theirs, to
whom I would ſhew a Deference, my <hi>Words,</hi> at leaſt, my <hi>Silence,</hi> ſhould carry Tokens of my Complaiſance. As for Example;
Did one whom I would not diſpleaſe, commend an ill Man, not well known to
him? or who had wrong'd, or diſoblig'd me? In ſuch Caſe, I would ſtifle
and conceal my Reſentment; and be ſilent, ſince I could not be of the
ſame Opinion with a Perſon whom I was unwilling to offend.</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">'NO, no cry'd, <hi>Ned Volatile,</hi> if ever I
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject my Humour, it ſhall be to the <hi>Ladies</hi>; There are many <hi>Capricio's,</hi> that muſt be borne with, from them; but, in all other
Caſes, <hi>my Mind is my Kingdom; I am abſolute, and will be

            <p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0199100801:383"/>HE ran on, to this Purpoſe, near a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of
an Hour; and, at laſt, happening to touch again on the Article of Honour and
Friendſhip, which had introduc'd the Subject of our Diſcourſe, the <hi>Major</hi> requeſted him to hear a Story, in which, an <hi>Example</hi>
of both theſe valuable Diſtinctions would better plead for their right
Uſe, than any Account he could give of <hi>his own particular Senſe</hi> of
them. The Story, ſaid the <hi>Major,</hi> is Modern; but not well known; and
amongſt all the Inſtances of Bravery, is a fine, and uncommon Diſplay of
it. 'Tis what moſt <hi>Fighters</hi> would think below them, yet, what none,
but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, could come up to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ALTAMONT,</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> were both Men of Quality,
and of Eminence in the Army, wherein they had ſerved long in Friendſhip
together. <hi>Altamont</hi> was, deſervedly, placed in the full Height of
Power and Preferment: <hi>Honorius,</hi> inferior but a ſmall Degree in
Poſt, was greatly ſo in Fortune; but he was fill'd with Princely Virtues,
and his Soul had a diſtinguiſh'd Greatneſs: He had been a Sharer in the
whole Courſe of <hi>Altamont</hi>'s innumerable
Glories.—<hi>Honorius,</hi> on ſome after-Occaſion, whether, as
ſuppos'd, by <hi>Altamont</hi>'s Breach of Promiſe, or what other Ground
for Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment happened, is neither known, nor mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to be debated; 'tis
ſufficient to tell you, That <hi>Honorius</hi> was ſo diſoblig'd, that he
ſent <hi>Altamont</hi> a Challenge, to determine their Difference, in a Duel,
at a Time appointed, in <hi>Hyde-Park.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:0199100801:384"/>AT the Time in which <hi>Altamont</hi> received
this Challenge, he was ſoo deeply ingaged in a Truſt, whereon depended the
Preſervation of the King's Perſon and Government, that he could not
ſacrifice, or neglect them, by riſquing his important Life, in a Perſonal
Quarrel, at that Juncture; but knowing well the Honour and Bravery of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and jealous too of his own, he ſent for <hi>Carolinus</hi>
early that Morning, in which he was to fight.—
<q rend="inline">'<hi>Brother,</hi> ſaid he, You know how much of the
Weight of Government lies at this Time upon my Shoulders, and there are ſome
ſecret Concerns of State, to which you are yet a Stranger. I am called upon
to a <hi>Duel</hi>: It concerns a Caſe of <hi>Honour,</hi> and my Adverſary
is a Man of Bravery. <hi>You</hi> muſt meet him, in my Stead, and give him
the Satisfaction he requires.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>CAROLINUS,</hi> reſolved to act in his Brother's Cauſe, as in
his own, without Delay, went to meet his unknown Opponent; but when he arrived
at the deſtin'd Spot, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, to ſee him the <hi>deareſt
Friend he had upon Earth!</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">'Good God! ſaid <hi>Honorius,</hi> to what am I
fated? I expected your <hi>Brother,</hi> and is it <hi>You,</hi> my <hi>Carolinus!</hi>'</q> 
               <hi>It is,</hi> replied <hi>Carolinus,</hi> with a
Sigh! They gaz'd on each other; their Breaſts were agitated by a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
of warring Paſſions!—After a Length of ſilent Confuſion, <hi>Honorius</hi> thus addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Carolinus</hi>—
<q rend="inline">'You are that very Friend, I ever called, and thought 
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0199100801:385"/> you; You are the Man who have ſo often vow'd the
moſt ſincere, and exalted Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for me.'</q> 
               <q rend="inline">'I am, replied <hi>Carolinus,</hi> and I bring with me
the ſame devoted Heart, a Sacrifice to your Diſpoſal! If you ſurvive,
you will know my Innocence, and the Cauſe why I am here, which weighty
Reaſons forbid the Diſcovery of at preſent; But come—<hi>Since it
muſt be thus</hi>'</q>—They both advanc'd, and in that Inſtant, <hi>Honorius</hi> cry'd, <hi>Hold my</hi> Carolinus! <hi>'Tis done! The
Struggle of my Soul is over, and our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at an End. I am determin'd! I
will not, I cannot break the Chain that has bound our Souls ſo long together;
no, not for your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Power, or my Prince's Crown.</hi>—They
continued ſome Time in Diſorder and Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation. Both of them were
brave, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignly brave! and none ever lived, who better knew what Honour
was, or could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it more nobly!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HONORIUS</hi> went on;—
<q rend="inline">'Well, my Friend, 'till now, I never felt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.

               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:0199100801:387"/>IT is much eaſier, indeed, <hi>to love,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Major,</hi> to pleaſe <hi>Ned Volatile,</hi> has indulg'd
him the Peruſal of that PICTURE OF LOVE, from which he recited the Verſes,
in my XXXIVth Paper.—I had the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be preſent, and to hear
him read it over. I call it a <hi>Misfortune,</hi> becauſe my Paſſion for
that wild <hi>Inſenſible,</hi> my Coquet, who is rambled away to <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> was half ſuppreſs'd before, for want of Occaſion to
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame it; but has rekindled itſelf, at the Fire which it catch'd from this

            <p>YET, why do I complain, that I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of a generous
Paſſion, which, to lay aſide the Pride of Wiſdom, and the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of
Age, and Gravity, he who is inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, is <hi>ſtupid?</hi>—The

returning <hi>through</hi> Happineſs, <hi>to</hi> Happineſs, <hi>from</hi>
Happineſs. The Emblem was ingenious, and the Lover's <hi>Ring</hi> is a
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſignificant, Alluſion to it.</p>
            <p>I AM ſo far, when I think <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> from being
aſham'd to be call'd a <hi>Lover,</hi> that I am, ſincerely, of Opinion,
that whoever has not lov'd, has put his Virtues to no Tryal.—Love is the
Breeze of Life: A healthful, <pb n="379" facs="tcp:0199100801:388"/> and refreſhing, <hi>Gale,</hi> which, by its Agitation of the Spirits, keeps our Faculties in
lively Motion; ſo, as neither to ſtagnate, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Reſt, nor drive
tempeſtuouſly, with the moſt ſtormy Paſſions.—The Heart of a
Lover is impreſs'd with Sweetneſs, and Humanity. His Soul receives
Extenſion, beyond its natural Power; and is as much more refin'd, than a <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> common, Soul, as that Soul, which it ſo excels, is
above the Body it belongs to.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſomething, in Love, that is ſtronger than <hi>Calamity,</hi> and more gentle than <hi>Pity!</hi> ſerener than <hi>Silence,</hi> more ſplendid than <hi>Riches,</hi> and ſtatelier than <hi>Honour!</hi> More trembling than <hi>Fear,</hi> and more charming than <hi>Pleaſure</hi>! It is, even more powerful than <hi>Conſcience:</hi> For
whom we love, we imagine, always, <hi>preſent,</hi> and paſſing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on our moſt ſecret Purpoſes. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate them, therefore, according to
our Apprehenſion of what She would <hi>approve,</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi>;
and, ſo, ſupply ourſelves with a conſtant Vigilance, and Propenſity
to noble Actions.</p>
            <p>IN ſome Senſe, he who <hi>loves,</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>like
a God</hi>; for he has but one, Care, and <hi>That,</hi> a Great, and a
Heavenly, One! He is, wholly, intent upon <hi>Beneficence.</hi>—He has
the Prophet's ſacred Privilege, to be rapp'd, out of himſelf! To enjoy
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Ecſtacy! To be emptied of his own Soul, that he may be animated by
one, <pb n="380" facs="tcp:0199100801:389"/> more dear to him!—Our Ideas of the Joys of <hi>Heaven,</hi> can repreſent them no other, than that we are, there, to <hi>love,</hi> and to <hi>be beloved</hi>: And they, who love, here on Earth,
are <hi>above</hi> the World, while they are <hi>in it.</hi> Nor can <hi>Death</hi> diſunite Lovers ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely as it does other People,
ſince <hi>Love</hi> dies not, with the <hi>Object lov'd.</hi> She lives, ſo
te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly, in our charm'd, and retentive, <hi>Memory,</hi> that her Death
ſeems no more, than a long, and lamented, Abſence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indearing, than
defacing, her Image.—So that <hi>This</hi> is the only Difference, which
Death ſeems capable of making, when he interpoſes between <hi>Lovers</hi>;—While both <hi>liv'd,</hi> their <hi>Two Bodies</hi> had
no more than <hi>One Soul:</hi> And, now one is <hi>dead,</hi> their <hi>Two
Souls</hi> hove no more than <hi>One Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NEITHER has <hi>Age,</hi> that alters all Things, a Power to deface
our <hi>Love</hi>; for, whom we love, can never ſeem Old. Our Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
preſents her Beauty everlaſtingly in its Spring: And her Idea is retain'd
inchanting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the very Attitude, which, firſt, ſhe ſtruck us by.</p>
            <p>THE reſtleſs, but unwearied, Lover, ſeeks for himſelf, <hi>out
of himſelf</hi>: Let him gaze, touch, liſten, and be bleſs'd, for ever,
yet, ſtill, he <hi>longs,</hi> and is unſatisfied!—There is a
Dropſy, in his Mind, and his Thirſt augments, with drinking.—His Soul
is either not at home, or in a ſtarting, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Poſture.—If
he preſſes his <pb n="381" facs="tcp:0199100801:390"/> Charmer's Hand, it darts, with
Violence, into his <hi>Fingers.</hi> If he leans at her lov'd Side, it beats
againſt his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> as if it would break its Priſon, to be <hi>nearer</hi> her. When ſhe ſpeaks, it is in his <hi>Ear:</hi> When he
looks on her, it is in his <hi>Eye:</hi> But, he has <hi>no Soul at all,</hi>
when ſhe is abſent.</p>

                  <l>And let looſe Fancy, to be feaſted, there.</l>
                  <l>Watch her lov'd Shadow, as it glances by:</l>

            <p>LOVERS converſe, like Angels, by a kind of <hi>Intuition</hi>! They <hi>hear</hi> one another's <hi>Souls</hi>; and prevent each other's <hi>Wiſhes.</hi>—Like Divinities quitting their Shrines, they diſrobe
themſelves of their <hi>Bodies</hi>; and intermingle their meeting <hi>Minds,</hi> as we ſee Two <hi>Lights</hi> incorporate.—Their Souls
glide out, from their Eyes, to ſnatch Embraces, at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and return,
inrich'd, with the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd Treaſure.—There is more Harmony, in Love,
than in Muſick: A Harmony! like that which the old Philoſophers imputed to
the Spheres! Only Two Spheres are <hi>acted</hi>; by one, and the ſame, <hi>Intelligence.</hi> For the Strings of Two Hearts ſympathize, like thoſe
of Two Lutes, with correſpondent Trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>HOW miſtaken are they, who call Love an <hi>idle</hi>
Paſſion!—<hi>Thought</hi> itſelf is ſcarce more active. There is
an unſatisfied, and continual Thirſt, in the Appetite of a Lover: 
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0199100801:392"/> A conſtant Spring, in his Delights, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He
purſues his Diſcoveries, with a reſtleſs, and impatient, Vigour: And,
tho' like the ſhining, heavenly, Bodies, he is, everlaſtingly, in Motion,
yet, he is ſo far from becoming weary, that he is rather refreſh'd, by his
Labour.</p>
            <p>I WILL copy, yet farther, from the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture abomentioned, the

            <p>I AM fond of thinking we might draw, from Love, a Proof of the <hi>Soul's Immortality:</hi> What, elſe, mean our Deſires, when they
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves, beyond the utmoſt, that willing Nature can indulge us
in.—Why, elſe, are the Joys of Love mix'd with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, 
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0199100801:394"/> and unſatisfied Tremblings?—They increaſe,
indeed, and refine, the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But they convince us, That there <hi>is</hi> a Union, more adapted to our Mind's free Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and, which,
Bodies are not <hi>fine</hi> enough to permit them the Enjoyment of.</p>
            <p>HENCE, that exquiſite <hi>Expanſion!</hi> That <hi>Liquefaction,</hi> of the Heart! when it refuſes to allow us the
Poſſeſſion of our deareſt Wiſh, in the very Moment we become
Maſters of it! The ſubtle Workings of this exalted Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon the
Refinements of our Mind, have <hi>Deified</hi> the beloved Object, 'till we
faint, with Awe, when we ſhould receive her Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: And, by a

Rivals!—The <hi>ſupremeſt Joy</hi> of Love muſt, if Men will have
it ſo, be <hi>call'd Bodily:</hi> But All, that heightens it, to be worth the
Wiſh of a wiſe Man, it muſt be indebted to the <hi>Mind</hi>
for.—Whence could Images ſo <hi>warm,</hi> as theſe which follow,
receive a Purity, in their Expreſſion, that adapts them to the chaſteſt
Ear, if the <hi>Mind</hi>'s Part were not ſtrongeſt, even where the <hi>Body</hi> pretends moſt Influence?</p>

            <p>IN my XXXVIth Paper, I publiſhed ſome Remarks on an excellent Old
Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad, called WILLIAM, and MARGARET. I was charm'd with the Strength, and
Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of its maſculine Simplicity: and, really, took it to <hi>be,</hi>
what it <hi>appear'd,</hi> The Work of ſome Old Poet, long ſince <hi>dead</hi>; but I have been agreeably undeceiv'd: The Author of it is alive,
and a <hi>North-Briton</hi>; I congratulate his Country, on the Promiſe of
this riſing Genius: For the Gentleman, it ſeems, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young, and
received his Education in the Univerſity of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AMONG many fine Qualities, which adorn him, he is ſo unconſcious
of his own Merit, or poſſeſſes it with ſo ſincere a Modeſty, that
he declines being publickly nam'd: But, as he <pb n="388" facs="tcp:0199100801:397"/> has
oblig'd me with a Letter, containing the ſhort Hiſtory of an unhappy
Accident, which gave Occaſion to his Ballad, it will be an agreeable
Entertainment if I publiſh it, as the Author ſent it me.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>YOUR PLAIN DEALER, of <hi>July</hi> the 24th, was ſent to me by a
Friend. I muſt own, after I had read it over, I was both ſurpriz'd and
pleas'd to find, that a ſimple Tale of my Writing, had merited the Notice,
and Approbation, of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the PLAIN DEALER.</p>
                  <p>AFTER what you have ſaid, of WILLIAM and MARGARET, I flatter
myſelf, that you will not be diſpleas'd with an Account of the Accident
which gave Birth to that Ballad.</p>
                  <p>YOUR Conjecture, that it was founded on the real Hiſtory of an
unhappy Woman, is true—A vain, young, Gentleman, had, for ſome Time,
profeſſed Love to a Lady, then in the Spring of her Life, and Beauty. He
dreſs'd well, talk'd loud, and ſpoke Nonſenſe, with <hi>Spirit:</hi>
She had good Underſtanding; but was too young to know the World. I have
ſeen her, very often. There was a lively Innocence in her Look. She had never
been addreſs'd to by a Man of <hi>Senſe:</hi> And, therefore, knew not how
deſpicable, and unſincere, a <hi>Fool</hi> is. In time, he perſuaded her,
that there was <pb n="389" facs="tcp:0199100801:398"/> Merit in his Paſſion.—She
believ'd him, and was <hi>undone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SHE was upon the Point of bringing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World the Effect of her
ill-plac'd Love, before her Father knew the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Judge the Sentiments
of the good Old Man! yet his Affection outweighed his Anger. He could not think
of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning his Child, to Want, and Infamy. He applied himſelf to her
falſe Lover, with an Offer of Half his Fortune; But the Temper of the
Betrayer was ſavag'd, with cruel Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. He rejected the Father's
Offers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd the Innocence he had ruin'd, with the Bitterneſs of
open Scorn. The News was brought her, when in a weak Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and caſt her
into a Fever. And, in a few Days after, I ſaw her, and her Child, laid in one
Grave, together.</p>
                  <p>IT was ſome Time after this, That I chanc'd to look into a Comedy
of <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s, called, <hi>The Knight of the burning Peſtle.</hi>
The Place I fell upon was, where old <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Thought</hi> repeats theſe
Verſes;

                        <l>When it was grown to dark Midnight,</l> 
                        <l>And all were faſt aſleep:</l> 
                        <l>In came <hi>Margaret</hi>'s grimly Ghoſt,</l> 
                        <l>And ſtood at <hi>William</hi>'s Feet.</l>

                  <p>WHICH, I fancy, was the Beginning of ſome Ballad, commonly known,
at the Time, when this Author wrote.—Theſe <pb n="390" facs="tcp:0199100801:399"/>
Lines, naked of Ornament, and ſimple, as they are, ſtruck my Fancy; I
clos'd the Book, and bethought myſelf, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Adventure, I have
mentioned above, which then came freſh into my Mind, might naturally raiſe
a Tale, upon the Appearance of this Ghoſt.—It was, then, Midnight. All,
round me, was ſtill, and quiet. Theſe concurring Circumſtances work'd my
Soul to a powerful Melancholy. I could not ſleep. And, at that Time, I
finiſh'd my little Poem, ſuch as you ſee it here. If it continues ſtill
to deſerve your Approbation, I have my Aim; and am,</p>

            <p>I CANNOT forbear confeſſing, that I ſhall expect, with a very
ſenſible Pleaſure, the Event of this Northern Correſpondence: For I
have retain'd, from my Infancy a kind <pb n="393" facs="tcp:0199100801:402"/> of affectionate
Partiality, for the generous Bravery, and gallant Plainneſs, of our
Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, beyond <hi>Tweed.</hi> When I travell'd, in my Youth, I ſcarce
ever ſaw a Court, even in the remoteſt Parts of the civiliz'd World, where
ſome Gentleman, or other, a <hi>Scot,</hi> by Birth, or Deſcent, was not,
one, of its nobleſt Ornaments: And, now, ſince the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and
the <hi>Graces,</hi> have, very viſibly, from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the preſent
Century, fix'd, and ſeated themſelves, in their learned Seminaries, their
riſing Youth, of both Sexes, ſeem to vie, with one another, in a warm, and
generous, Emulation which ſhall moſt adorn their own, or ſooneſt match
the Elegance, of other, even the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteſt, Nations.</p>
            <p>NOT the Gentlemen alone, but the very Ladies, of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
form themſelves into ſelect, and voluntary, <hi>Societies,</hi> for the
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their Knowledge, inſtead of the Entertainment of their Fancy:
And go on, at the ſame Time, to refine their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inrich their
Underſtanding, and poliſh, and render amiable, their Perſonal
Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I SHALL, in the Courſe of my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, take Occaſion to
demonſtrate the Truth of this Remark, by a Variety of Particulars; which,
while they are doing Juſtice to the <hi>North,</hi> will contribute, in no
ſmall Degree, to the Pleaſure of the <hi>South</hi> Part of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
At preſent, I ſhall produce but Two Inſtances: And the Firſt is, A
Society of <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0199100801:403"/> Young Gentlemen, moſt, if not all of them,
Students in the Univerſity of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who from a Sympathy of
Affections, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on a Similitude of <hi>Parts,</hi> and <hi>Genius,</hi>
have united themſelves into a Body, under Title of THE GROTESQUE CLUB; the
Reaſon of which Name, I ſhall explain in a future Paper. Their
Buſineſs, to expreſs it in the Words of one of their own Members, is, <hi>A Friendſhip that knows no Strife, but that of a generous Emulation, to
excell, in Virtue, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Politeneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO how ſurprizing a Degree theſe fine Spirits have ſucceeded, in
their noble <hi>End,</hi> let the following Sentiments declare; conceiv'd, and
expreſs'd, with all the Clearneſs, Depth, and Strength, of an <hi>experienc'd Philoſopher,</hi> by a Member of this <hi>Groteſque
Club,</hi> who was in his <hi>Fourteenth Year only,</hi> when he compos'd, in
Blank Verſe, a Poem, now in my Hands; and founded on a Suppoſition of the
Author's ſitting, a whole Summer Night, in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, looking upward, and
quite loſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in Contemplation on <hi>the Works, and Wonders, of
Almighty Power.</hi>—If this was a Subject, naturally above the Capacity

            <p>I HAVE endeavour'd to ſhew, in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Paper, that Parents are
highly to blame, when they force their Children to marry for the Sake of a
Fortune which can never repair the leaſt of thoſe innumerable Miſchiefs,
that are inſeparably annexed to it. Uſing Authority in ſuch a Caſe,
turns the moſt Indulgent of Fathers, into an inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tyrant, who by
one inconſiderate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that is irreverſible, dooms his own Child to the
moſt doleful Impriſonment for Life. The following Epiſtle, gives us ſo
ſad, but ſo lively a Repreſentation of this Truth, that I inſert it for
the Sake of thoſe, who might, poſſibly, be betrayed, in their Conduct, to
give the ſame fatal Proofs of their Affection to their Off-ſpring, that
ſeem to <hi>Edge</hi> all the Sufferings of our preſent Complainant.</p>

                  <p>I AM a Young Man, about Three and Twenty, that much againſt my
Will, have complied with the inceſſant Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of my Friends; or,
rather, obey'd the abſolute Commands of an indulgent Father, and a fond
Mother, in marrying a very Rich Maid of about Thirty Six, who, it ſeems, is
only mine, becauſe ſeveral Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of equal Pretenſions in Wealth with
herſelf, that liked her Perſon, left her, as ſoon as they had converſed
with her ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to ſound her Temper.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I married her, I enjoyed Health, and good Humour, and thought
my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune good enough as it was, and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient, with a Female
Companion that brought the like Ingredients towards it, to make Life tolerably
happy.</p>
                  <p>SHE has not been my Wife, quite a Year, and yet has managed her Time
ſo well, that ſhe has robb'd me of all my Quiet. The natural Gayety of my
Diſpoſition is ſowr'd, almoſt enough to make me think of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her
Torturer, as ſhe is mine: The Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridneſs of Health has left me; and I am
overcome by an inward Pining, that waſtes me outwardly: In fine, ſhe has
convinced me, that a Man may be emphatically Poor in the Affluence of Wealth,
and truly, and properly ſaid to Want, amidſt the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all
Things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="399" facs="tcp:0199100801:408"/> I HAVE induſtriouſly ſtudied to ſhew
Gratitude, and true Friendſhip. For I really had an Intention to render
my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as agreeable as poſſible; and the more, becauſe, during the
Time of our <hi>modiſh</hi> Courtſhip, ſhe had told thoſe, from whom I
ſhould hear it again, that ſhe lik'd me: By this <hi>habitual Art</hi> of <hi>Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> I almoſt brought it to be <hi>Natural,</hi> and began
to deceive myſelf into an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I ſhould not be incapable of even <hi>loving</hi> her at laſt. She, in Return, began, after a manner <hi>then</hi> perfectly unaccountable, to do every Thing, not only that ſhe
thought would diſoblige me, but that ſhe knew would be a ſincere
Affliction to me. I find <hi>ſince,</hi> I am taken, by way of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe could have <hi>her Man</hi>; and I am the Subject of her Revenge,
becauſe ſhe loſt, the Perſon, ſhe had a Liking to.</p>
                  <p>SHE is a Woman of a ſtrong, but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Underſtanding;
and letting it be <hi>guided,</hi> by what it ſhould <hi>correct,</hi> her <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> which is my inveterate Enemy, ſhe can be as poignantly
cruel to me as ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. She lets me know, by broad Hints, that ſhe <hi>ſees</hi> what would delight me, but is <hi>blind,</hi> like a <hi>Jew,</hi> out of Hardneſs of Heart. If I ask how I may oblige her, ſhe
is <hi>Dumb</hi>; but if I drop an ambiguous Word, that may be tortured into a
malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Conſtruction, ſhe can uſe her Tongue like a Larum.—If I
explain, the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity <pb n="400" facs="tcp:0199100801:409"/> of my Meaning, and beg Pardon
for want of Caution in expreſſing my-ſelf; her <hi>Ears</hi> are <hi>ſhut,</hi> and ſhe is like the <hi>Deaf Adder.</hi> The Compariſon is
true beyond the <hi>Deafneſs:</hi> ſhe is like it in my Boſom; ſhe
ſtings like it, ſhe poiſons like it, only with this Difference, That her
Poiſon is of an <hi>Italian kind</hi>; it lengthens out Torment, and kills,
at Diſtance of Years, after a painful Confinement.</p>
                  <p>IN my Father's Preſence, this fair Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, is never <hi>dumb,</hi> but ever <hi>eloquent</hi> in <hi>my</hi> Praiſe.—Such a
Husband! and ſuch a Wife! We are the happieſt Couple:—Then ſhe
calls often upon me, with an Air of Friendſhip, to be merry, under the
Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Melancholy ſhe cauſes. Her <hi>Eyes,</hi> her <hi>Ears,</hi> her <hi>Tongue,</hi> her <hi>Hands,</hi> ſeem all too little
to oblige me.—The Old Gentleman doats on her.—I help to carry on
the <hi>Farce</hi>; it would be <hi>Tragedy,</hi> if he knew
otherwiſe.—He bleſſes his Stars, and very comfortably puts me in
Mind, how much I poſſeſs the Joy he wiſhed me.</p>
                  <p>WHAT is to be done with this Riddle of a Woman, ſo much <hi>in</hi> her Senſes, and <hi>out</hi> of them, as ſhe pleaſes? What

            <p>TO what a Multitude of Sorrows is this genteel Complainer betray'd;
The firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, that ought to precede a Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Choice, are
the Piety, Education, Perſon, and Liking of both Parties; indeed, a competent
Fortune, is a material Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be weighed together with the others;
but never ſeparately from them. Of this <hi>Pliny,</hi> the politeſt
Gentleman, as well as fineſt Writer of his Age, has given us a
ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Account in Two of his Epiſtles, which I am glad, for the
Benefit of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ladies, <pb n="402" facs="tcp:0199100801:411"/> to find publiſhed in Two
Volumes in in <hi>Eagliſh.</hi> In one, he ſhews us his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in

of a judicious Choice, in the Perſon of his own Wife.</p>

                  <head>To <hi>JUNIUS MAURITIUS;</hi> on chuſing a Husband for his
Relation.</head>
                  <p>THE particular Opinion you have of my Choice of a Husband for your
Brother's Daughter, is very obliging; you well know, how much I loved and
eſteemed that great Man; with what Advice he che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed my Youth, and by
his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, gave me the Credit of being thought Praiſe-worthy: You
could have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined me nothing of greater Conſequence, or more agreeable,
nor any Thing I would undertake with more Honour, than to chuſe a Man fit to
continue the Family of <hi>Arulenus Ruſticus,</hi> which, indeed, might prove
a Work of Time, did not <hi>Minucius Acilianus</hi> luckily preſent, who, as
young Men do each other (for he is ſome Years younger) loves me intimately,
yet treats me with a Reſpect due to Age. He is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be form'd and
inſtructed by me, as I us'd to be by you. His Country is <hi>Breſica,</hi>
of that Part of our <hi>Italy,</hi> that does yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and keeps up much of
the Antient Modeſty, Frugality, and even Ruſticity. His Father <hi>Minucius
Macrinus,</hi> eminent in <pb n="403" facs="tcp:0199100801:412"/> the <hi>Equeſtrian</hi>
Order, for he aimed no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, being choſe by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> into
the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian,</hi> with great Conſtancy preferr'd an honeſt Eaſe
to this our Ambition (ſhall I call it?) or Honour. His Grandmother, of the
Mother's Side, is <hi>Serana Procula</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi>; you are
acquainted with the Manners of the Place, yet <hi>Serana</hi> is to the <hi>Patavins</hi> an Example of ſtrict Virtue. His Uncle <hi>P. Acilius</hi>
is a Man of ſingular Diſcretion, Prudence, and Honeſty; in Truth, you
will meet with nothing in the whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſs agreeable than in your own. <hi>Acili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> himſelf, has a great deal of Vigour and Induſtry,
accompanied with the utmoſt Modeſty. And having already diſcharged the
Offices of <hi>Queſtor, Tribune,</hi> and <hi>Praetor,</hi> with Abundance of
Credit, yet he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd it to you to make his Court for him. He has a
comely Face, a ſanguine Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, his whole Perſon Gentleman-like, with
a becoming Gravity in his Mein, Things, I think, not to be diſregarded, but
due to the Merit of a virtuous Woman. I am in Doubt, whether I need take
No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the large Eſtate of his Father; for when I conſider You, for
whom we propoſe a Son-in-Law, I think I need not: When I reflect on the <hi>Common Cuſtom,</hi> and even the Laws of the City, which principally have
Regard to the Fortunes of Men, <hi>that</hi> ſeems, by no Means, to be
omitted, and to one that thinks of Poſterity; this, in <pb n="404" facs="tcp:0199100801:413"/>
the making of a Match, is not the leaſt material Conſideration. Perhaps you
will think I have indulged too much the Love of my Friend in this Account; but
I will ſtake my Credit, you ſhall find every thing exceed my Deſcription:
I love the young Man, indeed, moſt ardently, as he deſerves; but it is the
Duty of Friendſhip, to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in Commendation.</p>

only to expreſs the Tenderneſs of the beſt of Aunts; but even ſupply
that of the beſt of Fathers: I am ſure it will be a Pleaſure to you to
hear, that ſhe proves worthy of her Father, worthy of you, and of your and
her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. Her Ingenuity is admirable, her Frugality extraordinary: She
loves me, the ſureſt Pledge of her Virtue, and adds to this, a wonderful
Diſpoſition to Learning, which ſhe has acquired from her Affection to me:
She reads my Writings, ſtudies them, and even gets them by Heart: You would
ſmile to ſee the Concern ſhe is in, when I have a Cauſe to plead, and
the Joy ſhe ſhews, when it is over: She finds Means to have the firſt
News brought her, of the Succeſs I meet with in Court; how I am heard, and
what Decree is made. If I <pb n="405" facs="tcp:0199100801:414"/> recite any Thing in Publick,
ſhe cannot refrain from placing herſelf privately in ſome Corner to hear,
where, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Delight, ſhe feaſts on my Applauſes. Sometimes
ſhe ſings my Verſes, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies them with the <hi>Lute,</hi>
without any Maſter, except Love, the beſt of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. From theſe
Inſtances I take the moſt certain Omens of our perpetual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
Happineſs, ſince her Affection is not founded on my Youth and Perſon,
which muſt gradually decay; but ſhe is in Love with the immutable Part of
me, my Glory and Reputation. Nor, indeed, could be leſs expected from One,
who had the Happineſs to receive her Education from you; who, in your Houſe
was accuſtomed to every Thing that was virtuous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and even began
to love me by your Recommendation: For, as you had always the greateſt
Reſpect for my Mother, you were pleaſed from my Infancy to form me, to
commend me, and kindly to preſage, I ſhould be, One Day, what my Wife
fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies I am. Accept therefore our united Thanks; mine, that you have
beſtowed her on me, and hers, that you have given me to her, as a mutual
Grant of Joy and Felicity.</p>

            <p>DETRACTORS may be ſaid to lead their Lives in a Habit of moſt
injurious Falſhood towards good Men, and of the moſt offenſive Impiety to
Heaven. Perſons, of this itching and abandoned Appetite, may, If we
conſider the numerous Miſchiefs they do to human Society, be compared to
the moſt ravenous Beaſts of Prey, with this Difference, That, as Beaſts
of Prey do good ſometimes, in worrying one another, theſe, on the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, will not fall upon, or devour any thing but what is excellent.</p>
            <p>WIT, Wiſdom, Beauty, good Humour, Modeſty, Valour, Integrity, in
fine, all the Virtues and all the Graces, which can illuſtrate any Perſon
of either Sex, are as ſo many tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="407" facs="tcp:0199100801:416"/> 
               <hi>Spoils</hi> to the ſavage Slanderer, and ſtrong Provocatives to
Detraction. There is ſcarce a Man living, that has many little, infamous
Srories, more than ordinary, privately handed about wirh great Induſtry, from
one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to depreciate his Character in the World, but what
will be found, upon a cloſe Examination, to have merited publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
for ſome noble Action or other; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine ſtill farther, and it will as
certainly be found, that <hi>that</hi> noble Action was the very Source of a <hi>ſecret</hi> Envy and a <hi>private</hi> Hatred, which broke out in a
Hundred <hi>whiſper'd Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> till it ſpread and inlarged
itſelf into <hi>publick Defamation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE moſt unhappy Circumſtances which attend the illuſtrious
Sufferers in this Way, I reckon to be theſe; That, as Perſons, who ſeek
after Fame the moſt eagerly, do, for the moſt part, very plentifully
deſerve it; ſo they are the moſt frequently interrupted in the Search,
and the leaſt able to bear the Trouble of ſuch unwelcome Interruptions. No
Men are more <hi>Ideally</hi> fond of Glory, than ſuch as moſt <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> deſerve it; this is a pleaſant Weakneſs: But
then no Men have a quicker Senſibility of unjuſt Reproaches than thoſe
who take Care never to deſerve them; and this is a ſore Frailty, which
opens, through the Boſoms of the Generous and the Innocent, a Way to a
Thouſand unneceſſary <hi>Heart-Achs.</hi> It is Pity, it ſhould be ſo
much in the Power of Calumny, as Experience ſhews it is, to ſtrike 
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0199100801:417"/> a Damp upon the moſt Generous Spirits, and throw a
Load over an aſpiring Mind, that is upon the Stretch after Glory. But what
ſeems at preſent the moſt of all to be regretted; is, That, by the
frequent Complaints I have lately received, this Vice is as prevailing, as it
is inſupportable.</p>
            <p>I HAVE a Letter from a Gentleman, containing a very lively
Deſcription of a Lady, whoſe Charms have been ſo long drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Tears,
that they are almoſt worn out and carried away by the waſting Tide of her
Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which ſhe hides, but cannot ſtop:—He proceeds to tell me, 
<q rend="inline">"That, upon Inquiry into the Source of this mighty
Woe, he finds it aroſe from Two or Three ambiguous and broken Sentences,
glancing at her Virtue, and Converſation, artfully dropp'd by a malicious
Woman in the Ear of a Youth of a Jealous Diſpoſition, who loved her whom <hi>ſhe</hi> loved, who was contracted to her, and departed from her on this
Account.—What ſignifies talking to her of her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and telling
her, that no Mortal liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing credits it but that <hi>one</hi> Jealous young
Man?—Alas! it is only <hi>his</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, that muſt pour
Comfort upon her Affliction.—'Till then ſhe muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as <hi>Inconſolable,</hi> as ſhe is <hi>Innocent.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>MY Correſpondent goes on to ſay, 
<q rend="inline">"That he had the Curioſity to go and ſee this
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractreſs. He found her, as he tells me, Old, Wrinkled, Ugly; her Viſage
of a pale, juſt turning black, as with a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; 
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0199100801:418"/> her Conſcience he takes to be much of a Complexion
with her, Face; for, when he charged her with it, ſhe own'd it as ſome <hi>trifling Miſtake</hi>; then, drawing her Mouth into a ſcornful Smile,
to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict her Words, cries out, That <hi>ſhe did not mean it as it was
taken.</hi>—When the <hi>fatal</hi> Conſequences were preſs'd upon
her,—ſhe ſaid, <hi>She was ſorry,</hi> but expreſs'd her Grief
ſo very <hi>unconcernedly,</hi> deſiring <hi>to be troubled no more about
it,</hi> ſince <hi>it was not Actionable,</hi> that ſhe might have ſate
for the Picture of <hi>Envy</hi>'s Look, when ſhe has juſt ſtollen from
doing one of her moſt <hi>precious</hi> Miſchiefs."—</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Correſpondent of mine, juſtly mov'd with his own Relation,
concludes his Letter with warm Expoſtulations.—
<q rend="inline">"Shall GUILT <hi>ſin</hi> thus! and ſhall
INNOCENCE look <hi>pale</hi> for it; is there no Redreſs,—Yes, there
is—Others, who are out of the Queſtion, may, and ought to riſe up in
the Defence, of Innocence.—Let the PLAIN DEALER, ſays he, whenever any
Scandal is traced to the Fountain-head, but mark the Quarters of the
Detractors, as Croſſes in the Time of the Peſtilence are placed upon the
Doors of the Deceaſed, and that Method will effectually ſtrike the Tongue
of Detraction dumb."</q>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER Account has been lately tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmitted to me, concerning a
young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is ſaid to have numerous good <pb n="410" facs="tcp:0199100801:419"/>
Qualities, and has been divided from the Eſtimation of his Friend, by the as
conſtant as falſe Inſinuations of a worſe than once perjured Woman; who
inſiſts, That the young Gentleman betrayed his Friend's Liberty for a
Bribe.—The contrary has been made out, and atteſted to her
Face—She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, behind his Back, to load him with the
Calumny.—Finding, ſince ſhe began her Evil Reports, that they would
not take with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting on an Air of Charity and Sanctity, ſhe now
concludes her Story to Srrangers thus. 
<q rend="inline">"—He (meaning the Perſon ſhe aims to
ſcandalize) is generally allowed to be a good Man, an honeſt
Man—Pretty ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally indeed.—But what is there to be ſaid for
Accidents in this World?—There is nothing wonderful—Nothing new
under the Sun.—I have ſo often Occaſion to Wonder, that I am
reſolved never to let any Thing, for the Future, ſurprize me into a Fit of
Admiration.—He is no Lover of Money—that is certain, as ſome
ſay.—But, ſay they what they will, there is ſuch a Prevalence in
Bribes, no one knows his own Strength till he be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—There is no
truſting any Body.—I would not have believed it of him if <hi>Every-Body had not ſaid it</hi>; but, <hi>What Every-Body ſays muſt
be true.</hi>"—</q>
            </p>
            <p>HERE my Correſpondent ſays, he asked the Detractreſs, <hi>How
Every-Body came to know it?</hi> and ſhe immediately boaſted, That ſhe 
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0199100801:420"/> was the Diſcoverer of it, to all who heard it at <hi>firſt Hand,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"To what, continues he, may we properly liken ſuch a
dangerous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as this is, who puts out falſe Colours that ſhe may
come up ſafe, and rob Virtue, unſuſpected? She can be compared to
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that reſembles her ſo nearly as a <hi>Witch,</hi> in one of
thoſe fatal Operations, where Murder is the Conſequence of her
Incantations. The Detractreſs molds her Deſcriptions, as the <hi>Witch</hi>
does her Waxen Images. When the <hi>Witch</hi> has made an End of her Image,
the bewitch'd Body periſhes; and where the Detractreſs ends any of her
Deſcriptions, ſhe makes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Reputation die!"</q>

                  <p>I HAVE been Married about Two Years to a Young Woman that is every
Way agreeable to my Temper, but only ſhe is given to be a little too
Superſtitious. The Truth is, ſhe was determined in her Choice of me by the
Prediction of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-teller. Without thinking myſelf more oblig'd to him,
than in good Reaſon I <pb n="413" facs="tcp:0199100801:422"/> ſhould. I may ſafely ſay,
without Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I ſhall like him for having cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my good
Fortune, by foretelling it, the longeſt Day I have to live. She would be the
beſt-natur'd Creature in the World, if her Mind was not haunted by Spirits,
Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of which, take up moſt of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation by Day, and make her
waken me a Nights very frequently. I laugh'd at theſe little Tales at
firſt, but, not being able to get her out of them, I indulged her in the
relating them, which ſhe has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to do ſo prettily, that, though I
know, according to right Reaſon, I ought not to be Terrified, I am brought to
trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the tumbling of a Saltſeller.—If my Wife could be once
cured, I am ſure I ſhould be well ſoon after.—She has been for
theſe Three Months laſt, counting our Hours by a Death-watch, and has made
me almoſt ſick with Fear, that ſhe, who ſo often ſpeaks of her Death,
ſhould die in good Earneſt—This ſplenetick Caſt of her Temper
having an Effect on me, who ſympathize with her in every Thing, throws a
Gloom over our Hours, which would otherwiſe paſs as delightfully, as any
Couple's upon Earth.—Pray give her ſome better Reaſons, than I am
able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill into her, to fortify her Mind againſt theſe little
Surprizes of Superſtition; and you will make her the beſt Wife in the

have got many a ſweet Kiſs for what in another Couple would have gone near

                  <p>YOU lately gave us ſo lively a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Races at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> that I cannot but wiſh you would exert your <hi>Wooden-Horſe,</hi> as Men of your Age commonly call their <hi>Oaken-Sticks,</hi> and take a Journey from your <hi>Watch-Tower</hi> of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bican</hi> to <hi>Exchange Alley.</hi> You will find that the Citizens,
who have been a long Time injuriouſly miſrepreſented as a plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Generation of People, have as <hi>brisk</hi> Imaginations, in <hi>their
way,</hi> as any of the <hi>quickeſt Wits</hi> that inhabit the <hi>Temple,</hi> or <pb n="416" facs="tcp:0199100801:425"/> any <hi>courtly</hi> Part of the
Town beyond the <hi>Bar.</hi> Their <hi>Fancies</hi> run upon <hi>Wheels,</hi>
but they are <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> ones, and, ſince the Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery has been
ſet up, they all ſeem to turn upon that great and important One, of <hi>Fortune.</hi> They are ſo clever in their Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they have formed
ſeveral <hi>Streets</hi> into <hi>Courſes,</hi> and fix'd a convenient <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> juſt at hand, where a Man may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a <hi>Racer,</hi>
at any Hour of the Day, to try his Luck upon, and ſcower away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a large
Eſtate, between Sun and Sun. In fine, the Scene of <hi>Newmarket</hi> is
ſhifted to <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Smithfield</hi> tranſlated into <hi>Exchange-Alley.</hi> As ill a Figure as the top Citizens have been ſaid
to make on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, with all their Pageants about them on a <hi>Lord-Mayor's Day,</hi> yet, to do them Juſtice, now, they are become
ſerious in <hi>Horſeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and have turned Play into a Trade, you
cannot imagine what <hi>expert Jockies</hi> they make. Our News-Papers have
lately diverted us with ſtrange Accounts of <hi>ſlow</hi> Beaſts called <hi>Aſſes,</hi> that have been brought up to be very nimble, and of <hi>Cows,</hi> turn'd into <hi>Gallopers,</hi> for the Sport of our ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Brethren that have <hi>running</hi> Heads in the Country: We have very far <hi>overmatch'd</hi> them, in Town, for we have <hi>Exchange Bears,</hi> and <hi>Exchange Bulls,</hi> that will mount a <hi>Titt</hi> as <hi>cleverly</hi>
as if they were born to it. They will purchaſe you a <hi>Nag</hi> for <hi>Three Half Crowns,</hi> and count him but a mere <pb n="417" facs="tcp:0199100801:426"/> 
                     <hi>Jade,</hi> if he wins the <hi>Rider leſs</hi> than a <hi>Thouſand
Pounds. Guildhall</hi> is the Goal they run to, and if one of your City-Racers
comes in at the Nick, as we call it, (for we run the Twelve Hours by <hi>lucky
Minutes.</hi>) two <hi>Boys</hi> hold up their Hands, and bid the Man, that has
run the <hi>Courſe,</hi> be happy all his Life after. I don't doubt but when <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> Fair was put to ſo early a Period, you deplored the
Accident, becauſe, laſting a little longer, the odd Mirth of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that frequented it, would have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed you with Materials without going
far from your Neighbourhood. But this <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Bear</hi> Fair, in
the City, will be of long Continuance, and make you ample Amends if you will
but come and ſee it; When I ſee the Wheel go round, and the Racers are by
at the Twirling of it, my Imagination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it to me, like the flying
Chariots, and Machines, for young Travellers in <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> in which,
methinks, I ſee an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice ſeated over the Head of a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council-Man; a Suburb-Habardaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Small Wares mounted three
Stories higher in Fortune than a grave Alderman with a Gold Chain about his
Neck; and a Semſtreſs more lofty than a Lady Mayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs. But I am giving
you a Deſcription which I had rather you ſhould come and take; I dare ſay
it will make as diverting a Paper, at leaſt, as the Liſt of the Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
Tickets, and you need not deſire a <pb n="418" facs="tcp:0199100801:427"/> better Prize than
to have yours read by equal Numbers, with equal Curioſity, Deſire, and
Circumſpection. I am of the <hi>Mule Kind</hi> in Trade, and ſometimes <hi>Bellow</hi> in the Alley, like a <hi>Bud,</hi> upon the <hi>Fall,</hi> and

            <p>THE Eſtimation, of publick Actions, ſeems to me to be unjuſtly
calculated, Men derive the <hi>Quality</hi> of Actions from that of the Actor;
Would it not be more juſt to meaſure the Actor by the Action? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
conſidered the Degrees of Superiority to conſiſt in thoſe of Merit and
Virtue. <hi>Pliny</hi> has diſtinguiſh'd himſelf, by Remarks, on this
Head, in his admirable Epiſtles, and tho' he was at the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> as well as the <hi>Wits</hi> of his Age, he thought it not
below him, to pay Acknowledgments, <pb n="420" facs="tcp:0199100801:429"/> nay, refined
Compliments, to the Merit of Perſons in low Life; but took a worthy Pride in
raiſing them from the Obſcurity, annexed to that Condition, by a <hi>Compariſon</hi> with the higheſt renowned for Deeds which ſprang from
the ſame Greatneſs and Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit. As Titles are often but
Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, this is a juſt Way of Judging; ſince Worth is not the
Conſequence of a Name, but a great Name ought ever to be the Conſequence of
Virtue.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"MODERN Writers," ſaid our <hi>Critick,</hi> the
other Evening, "have gone into a different Turn of Thinking: They extol, to the
Skies, the indifferent Actions, and palliate the Blemiſhes, of Titled People,
who diſgrace the Figure of Life they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in; but meanly, decline the
right Uſe of Art upon Subjects, where they might point out Greatneſs in
obſcure Men, who were never <hi>little</hi> in any Thing but the <hi>Accident</hi> of their Birth, and who <hi>living</hi> and <hi>dying,</hi>
did an Honour to Human Nature. Such Pen-men may be called, <hi>The Rabble of
the Wits,</hi> who are dazled by the falſe Glare of the Great, but can look
at ſolid, Virtue, without the leaſt Emotion, or Sign, of being able to
ſee it. The Stiles of theſe petty Panegyriſts, are, like their Subjects,
glittering, but not ſolid; ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but rather empty than great; they
ſeem never to have heard of that beautiful <pb n="421" facs="tcp:0199100801:430"/> Simplicity,
which ariſes out of Nature, and forms the Sublime, ſo much admired by the
Readers, and ſo maſterly executed by the Writers of Antiquity."</q>
            </p>
            <p>WE were led into this Track of Thinking, by my looking, the other Day,
into a little Book, call'd, <hi>The Hiſtory of the Preſervation of</hi>
Charles <hi>the Second, after the noted Battle of</hi> Worceſter; which was
fought in the Year 1651, on the Third of this very Month of <hi>September.</hi>
I there meet with ſuch a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inſtance of Fidelity, and Loyalty, in
a poor mean Country Fellow, nam'd <hi>Pendrell,</hi> and all his <hi>Family,</hi> that I know not <hi>any</hi> ſo Illuſtrious, to which my
Heart would lead me to pay greater, or ſincerer Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I am not
at all ſurprized, to find, that this amazing Incident, of Integrity, is
coolly, and inſenſibly, treated by Men of ſlender Abilities; who have an
Affectation to ſhine upon more pompous Subjects; who chuſe rather to
ſpend their Strength in relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fury of that Battle, and lay out all
their miſtaken Eloquence in raiſing the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Hell, to puſh on its
horrible Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; but it is both a Matter of Surprize, and Confuſion,
to think, that ſo many truly great Poets, and Orators, ſhould live juſt
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and leave an Example, ſo beneficial to Poſterity, in a manner
forgotten, for want of being commended, with that Spirit it ſo richly
deſerves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:0199100801:431"/>PERHAPS the Hiſtory of the whole World, were
we to turn it never ſo carefully over, could furniſh us with but few Things
more aſtoniſhing, more moving, and pathetick, more exemplary, and edifying,
than this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celebrated Paſſage!—A Monarch to be forced, by a
prevailing Faction, to turn a Fugitive, in his own Kingdoms! And when
diſcomfited Princes, diſabled Lords, and routed Armies, could no longer
aſſiſt their Sovereign, that it ſhould be reſerved for a poor
ſimple Hind to preſerve this Lord's Anointed from a cruel, purſuing
Victor, whoſe praeternatural Swells of Fortune made him the Terror of all <hi>Chriſtendom!</hi>—That it ſhould be reſerved for an ignorant
Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to ſave a wiſe and mighty Prince from falling, like his good
Father, to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, received as our Glory, with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes and
Acclamations, not only of our own Three Kingdoms, but all the Nations about us!
And ſhall this <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Honour, by foreign
Writers, be only coldly ſpoken of by our own?—Is he a mean Man?
Conſider the noble Truſt, and the nobler Diſcharge of it! and he grows
great in Proportion to the Littleneſs of his Condition. Is he Poor? How does
that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty add to the Richneſs of his Virtue, who hears <hi>Praemiums</hi>
bid for the precious Life, he has in Cuſtody, and yet, diſdaining the Bribe
of Gold, ventures his own for his Loyalty? Sure, nothing but a Soul, which is
abandon'd <pb n="423" facs="tcp:0199100801:432"/> to Barbarity and Meanneſs, can let a little
Idea of him take Place, upon Account of his deſpicable Figure. It is the
nobleſt Addition to his Greatneſs! As inconſiderable as he might be
otherwiſe, he muſt, in this View, make a fine Picture, and he is a living
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to that Herd of Titled Criminals, who follow'd the Fortunes, and
partook the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Greatneſs, of the Purſuer of Majeſty. Let thoſe,
who look no farther than the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of Things, think a <hi>Plebian,</hi>
below <hi>Eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>; I, who view him with other Eyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt think him
above it. Had he lived in more generous Times, and been the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of an <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> his honeſt Contempt of Gold, would have juſtly given
him a Place equal with <hi>Camillus,</hi> in the <hi>Horatian</hi> Ode,
conſecrated to the Praiſes of that Emperor.</p>
            <p>IT is a Scene, that the Imagination can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not entertain without a
Mixture of Grief and Admiration, when we place before our Eyes that Prince in
the Habit of a Ruſtick, amidſt ſo many different Dangers, relying upon
the Conduct and Fidelity of this <hi>real</hi> Ruſtick, this venerable Clown,
and his little Family for his Guards. I remember to have been informed, by a
very great Man, That 
<q rend="inline">"He has heard the King tell the Story in Jeſt, and
wonder'd to ſee many ſmile, when his Majeſty ſaid pleaſantly, That <hi>He He was once in danger of loſing his Guide in the Night-Time, but that
the Ruſtling of</hi> Richard<hi>'s Calves-Skin Breeches was a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:0199100801:433"/> 
                  <hi>to his Ear in the Dark.</hi> The King might, indeed,
make a Jeſt of it, ſaid he, but I could not think of Majeſty in ſuch
Diſtreſs, without being touch'd in good Earneſt, by a Grief, which it was
beyond the Notion of an odd and comical Dreſs to remove."</q>—I muſt
ſay the ſame, as this Nobleman, with regard to the King; and even as to <hi>Pendrell,</hi> there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too ſerious in his Integrity, not to
make us loſe his Appearance, in our Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Virtues. As there was
a Princely Perſon in one rough Garb; there was a noble Soul in the other; for
when he attended the King, for the laſt Time, he ſhewed, he had a true
Senſe of the Weight of his Charge. For, his Majeſty complaining of the
Horſe, <hi>That it was the heavieſt Jade he ever rode on; Pendrell,</hi>
ſmilingly told him, <hi>That the Horſe had the Weight of Three Kingdoms on
his Back, and ought not therefore to be blamed, if he went a little
heavily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN I Meditate the many Paſſages, that this little Hiſtory
recounts, between the King and <hi>Pendrell,</hi> my Attention is ſo fixed to
the Parts, which exerciſed this Man's Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, that I ſcarce have Room in
my Thoughts, for the Glories of a Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he was reſerved for. I
love to dwell upon this good Man: It is a familiar Example, but it is the more
uſeful; the Leaſt Man may be faithful, and Fidelity will make him Great;
while the Greateſt Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb n="425" facs="tcp:0199100801:434"/> Integrity, dwindles
into a Little one.—It is true, alſo, Integrity makes a Great Man much
Greater; ſo it is with <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Monk,</hi> a Name, far beyond his Title.
Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> ſtrikes no Ear; calls for no Admiration. But
Every one admires the <hi>General</hi> and the <hi>Reſtorer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A LITTLE gentlemanly Eſtate was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſettled upon his
Deſcendants; and had he been advanced by the Pleaſure of the King, from
that lowly Degree, to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, no Lord could have thought himſelf
injur'd, by having for his Peer, and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Heir of that worthy Man,
who preſerved the Fountain of Honour.</p>

               <hi>CREDULITY</hi> is a Weakneſs, from which very few are exempted.
It is the Ground-work of Craft and Impoſture; and the Means by which they are
propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
            <p>I HAVE often reflected, with Concern, upon the Condition of Humanity,
in this Regard: And nothing can be more afflicting, than to behold one Part of
the rational World making a <hi>Trade</hi> of miſguiding the other! If all
the Errors, into which People are drawn, had but the Marks of <hi>Truth,</hi>
ſome Excuſe, might be found for their <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity</hi>; but the Shame
is, in their receiving what is <hi>new,</hi> at the Expence, even of <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.</hi> 
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:0199100801:436"/> Vulgar Minds are moſt
ſtruck with what is moſt incredible; and the Way to <hi>convince,</hi> is,
to <hi>amaze</hi> them. <hi>Reaſon</hi> makes few Proſelytes: But <hi>Myſtery</hi> rarely fails. And the leſs they know why, the fonder they
grow of the Impoſture.</p>
            <p>BECAUSE I would not dip into Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, wherein <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> are concern'd; I muſt deſcend
into Low Life, and only touch the little Artifices which owe their Reputation
to this Weakneſs.</p>
            <p>THE World is wearied with Stories of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Fairies,</hi> and begins to ſee thro' the Impoſture. The Craft of <hi>Aſtrologers, Conjurers,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> begins alſo to be
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, by the Vulgar, whoſe <hi>Oracles</hi> they have long been. But I
am not a little amaz'd to find, that, inſtead of the Deluſions, once
practis'd on the Multitude, They, now, work ſtrongeſt among the polite and
faſhionable People. What Staring, what Clapping, what Waſte of Time and
Money have <hi>Harlequin</hi> and <hi>Fauſtus</hi> occaſion'd? The
Madneſs, both of <hi>Actors,</hi> and <hi>Spectators,</hi> has ſo provok'd
me almoſt to Tears, that I could even have <hi>wept over the City!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I WILL not be ſo partial, to our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful Society of FREE <hi>and</hi> ACCEPTED MASONS, as to forbear reproving them, on this Occaſion,
for the unaccountable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Noiſe they have lately made in the World.
What Stories have been told to amuſe, and engage the <hi>Credulous?</hi> What
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0199100801:437"/> Reflections, what Reproach, have they brought upon That
ANCIENT ORDER, by making Proſelytes, in ſo cheap and ſo proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a
Manner? It afflicts me ſenſibly, when I ſee Coxcombs introduc'd into our <hi>Lodges,</hi> and made privy to our <hi>Secrets.</hi> I have often enter'd
my Proteſt againſt this Abuſe, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Society; and muſt uſe the
Freedom to offer this Memorial, in my publick Character. 'Tis my Opinion, That
the late Proſtitution of our <hi>Order</hi> is in ſome Meaſure, the
betraying it. The weak Heads of <hi>Vintners, Drawers, Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
Weavers,</hi> &amp;c. admitted into our <hi>Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> have not only
brought Contempt upon the Inſtitution, but do very much endanger it. And I
have heard it ask'd, Why we don't admit <hi>Women,</hi> as well as <hi>Taylors,</hi> into our <hi>Lodges?</hi> I muſt confeſs I have met with
as <hi>ſufficient</hi> Heads among the <hi>Fair Sex,</hi> as I have found in
the BROTHERHOOD: I have ſome Reaſons to fear, that our SECRETS are in
Danger. There is, in the Conduct of too many, ſince their Admiſſion, the

                  <l>Arcanique Fides prodiga, perlucidior vitro;</l> 
               </q> which is
expreſly prohibited by our Excellent RULES and CONSTITUTIONS; and, which is
the very Characteriſtick of the Fools, that were received into the LODGES at <hi>ROME,</hi> in the Days of <hi>AUGUSTUS CAESAR</hi>; <pb n="429" facs="tcp:0199100801:438"/>
and whereof our Brother <hi>HORACE</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd vehemently, in an <hi>Ode</hi> to <hi>VARUS,</hi> who was then GRAND MASTER. But whatever

                  <p>BY the Help of my <hi>Secretary</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter</hi> I
peruſe your Lucubrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and write this Epiſtle, to aſſure you of my

                  <p>I AM inform'd, that you have taken Notice of the <hi>Advertiſement</hi> I cauſed to be publiſh'd in the News-Papers; and
that you call'd at the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> to be ſatisfy'd of the Truth of my
Arrival in this Place. Your Enquiry, and the Converſation you had with my
Secretary, give me Occaſion to gratify you farther; and I am proud to have it

                  </p>
                  <p>MY Reſidence here will be ſhort. It cannot therefore be
expected, that I ſhou'd invite many worthy Perſons to enter into our <hi>Order</hi>; nor dare I render it cheap and contemptible, by admitting every

                  <p>I SHALL conſider it as an Ornament to our <hi>moſt ancient</hi>

ſpontaneous) Affection to a Family who know not me, or that I am now writing,
or intending to write to you, or any body concerning them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:0199100801:444"/> I AM juſt now ſeated at a Coffee-houſe,
not far from the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> where I am very much affected (as I
often have been) with the genteel, humble Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bar-keeper; A
Deportment moſt agreeably adapted to her preſent Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Yet, at
the ſame time, ſuch as betokens a Genius ſuperior to this Way of
Livelihood. It is known to every body that ſees this Gentlewoman (ſeeing
her is knowing it) that ſhe is a Gentlewoman: But that, moreover, ſhe has <hi>this</hi> additional Merit, To have been the Comfort, the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and
beloved Comfort, of the great and admirable <hi>Favellus</hi>; this perhaps is
not ſo univerſally known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FAVELLUS</hi> was an eminent Preacher of the Town: Thoſe that
know his Character, can tell 'twas a Compound of all the good Characters
belonging to a Chriſtian, to a Divine, to a Gentleman. He had a moſt
extenſive Genius, which, with his own Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Induſtry, made vaſt
Acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all ſorts of Theological Literature. This will appear to a
Man of any Sagacity, that makes uſe of That and his Sermons, when
publiſh'd, which are now Printing by Subſcription. The firſt of theſe
Sermons, that was preached in my Hearing, gave me a moſt ſurprizing Mixture
of Pleaſure and Concern: <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> in hearing, at once, a <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and a <hi>Euclid,</hi> a <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and a <hi>Bentley</hi> (<hi>All</hi> met together) <hi>All</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0199100801:445"/> in this accompliſh'd Divine; who was himſelf a
moſt powerful, a moſt pathetick <hi>Orator,</hi> a moſt exact <hi>Reaſoner,</hi> a moſt perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>Theologer,</hi>—in one
Word, <hi>an univerſal conſummate Scholar.</hi>—This was the <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> A <hi>Concern</hi> too it gave me (a Concern
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible) ariſing from a certain Uneaſineſs I felt in my own
Breaſt, from reflecting, that tho' I had been Years in <hi>London,</hi> this
was but my <hi>Firſt</hi> Pleaſure of hearing this inimitable Man. After
this, you may be ſure I became his eager Attendant: And of All the Sermons I
attended, Head and Heart ſay this.—They were All, to a Degree that is
incredible, <hi>All</hi> Edifying, All Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; Entertaining, I mean in
that Way wherein Theological Performances <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to
entertain. 'Tis rare, <hi>remarkably</hi> rare, to meet with the Man that
writes, or indeed is <hi>capable</hi> of writing, in that Cloſe, that
Mathematical, that Concatenating Way he excell'd in; or, that has the ſame
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity in <hi>Pointing out</hi> the Intricacies of an Argument, together
with the ſame Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſame Clearneſs in <hi>Removing</hi>
'em;—putting Prejudice to the Bluſh;—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling Scripture to
Scripture;—making Error <hi>appear</hi> to be Error, Truth to be Truth.
You'd be ſure not only to be pleas'd, but to <hi>exult</hi> in the Pleaſure
you took, if you had heard him frequently, as I did, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing (and that ſo
ingeniouſly) ſome Truths that were uncommon, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0199100801:446"/> common ones in an uncommon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; making obſcure
Things plain; plain Things <hi>ſurprizingly</hi> plainer.—To raiſe
Objections ſo <hi>pertinently,</hi> to ſtate 'em ſo <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly,</hi>
to anſwer 'em ſo <hi>unanſwerably,</hi> is a Talent, or rather <hi>many</hi> Talents, wherein but few Men, if few, cou'd come up to him.</p>
                  <p>I ASK now, Shou'd it not be (Matter of <hi>Wonder</hi> to ALL Men,
and) to Men of Merit, <hi>Concern,</hi> that this very Man, a Man of their own
Number, a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel too, an <hi>eminent</hi> Miniſter, an
eminent Writer,—Great in Learning,—Great in Goodneſs,—Great
in Renown,—Of a meek humble, winning Diſpoſition,—Of a ſweet,

Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,—Withal too, a Man of ſtrict <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy</hi> (and is not <hi>This</hi> alone a Thouſand good Characters?)—I ſay, ſhou'd it
not, even in Point of <hi>Humanity</hi> (much more ſo of <hi>Charity</hi>)
affect <hi>All</hi> Men <hi>of Merit</hi> or that <hi>love</hi> Merit, to
obſerve how it paſs'd unrewarded, ſlighted, diſcourag'd, tho' ſeen
plainly, tho' admir'd univerſally, in this excellent Man?</p>
                  <p>THINK—(and grieve when you think) how he Died! How Indigent!
How <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi> Indigent!—and this, after a Life wherein there
was nothing of Exceſs,—ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of its being painful, <hi>willingly</hi> pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>Himſelf,</hi>—and that purpoſely
that it might be uſeful to <hi>Others.</hi>

                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:0199100801:447"/> BEHOLD him, <hi>when Living,</hi> living

where: <hi>At Home</hi> Studious, at Home Frugal, in all his Oeconomy: <hi>Abroad</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom—except at his Church: <hi>At Church</hi>
attended with a full Congregation (perhaps the fulleſt in this great City,
wherein were Perſons of almoſt all Denominations, all all Ranks and
Perſwaſions; all pleas'd, all <hi>greedy</hi> to hear this incomparable
Man.—And yet,</p>
                  <p>BEHOLD him, <hi>when Dying,</hi> not worth enough to defray the
Charge of his Funeral! <hi>Now,</hi> it appears (thro' his own ſingular
Modeſty, it did not <hi>till now</hi>) What a poor Livelihood (—Wonder,
and be aſtoniſh'd! and yet this was <hi>All</hi> his Livelihood (for

that his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs'd Widow, and Two or Three young lovely Children, at
leaſt <hi>ſome</hi> of 'em, are likely, e'er long, (—O pity! pity!)
even to—I <hi>cannot</hi> ſpeak it!—What ſhall I
ſay?—My Heart bleeds when I think of it. He died, as I'm told, not
worth Ten Shillings.</p>
                  <p>WITHIN the Circle of your Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and my own, there are, <hi>ſome,</hi> no doubt, that have Inclinations, but want <hi>Abilities</hi>
to be Beneficent; ſome, that have Abilities, but want Inclinations: Some, 
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0199100801:448"/> that have <hi>Both,</hi> and would imploy both, but know
not <hi>where</hi> to employ 'em. To theſe laſt ſort of Perſons, to all
theſe able-well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Perſons, namely, to all that have <hi>no
Heirs</hi> of their own to inherit after them, or have more Riches than enough
for their Heirs, and for ſuch like Reaſons have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Deſign, I
ſay, To <hi>theſe</hi> ſurely I need not ſay more.</p>
                  <p>PITY, even common Pity, mov'd me thus to throw in a Word or two (I
hope, at leaſt, 'twill have <hi>ſome</hi> favourable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) in
Favour of this unhappy Widow and Children (the Melancholy Remains of that
Learned Good Man I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of); and the this rather, becauſe,
as you ſee, they are now reduc'd, for the Sake of a Subſiſtence, to the
Buſineſs of a Coffee-houſe.</p>
                  <p>THE Widow's Demeanor, in this new Way of Life, as I told you, <hi>genteel</hi> Humility, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive, eaſy, chearful in this the
Station allotted her, <hi>Becauſe</hi> 'tis allotted her. She has this
Character, in all its Beauty and Elegance, in all the Nicety and Goodbreed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
belonging to it. See the <hi>Whole</hi> of her Conduct. See in that, the <hi>worſt</hi> of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities in its beſt Dreſs. Whoever attends to it
(and whoever beholds <hi>cannot but</hi> attend to it) has a very <hi>inſtructive</hi> Amuſement. There is ſcarce an Action ſhe does,
that in this Way is not an excellent Document, being itſelf a Comment on that
polite Humility I am ſpeaking of. To ſee her, juſt now, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:0199100801:449"/> me the Diſh of Coffee, I call'd for, with HER <hi>peculiar</hi> Way of doing it, is an admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Criticiſm on thoſe
Words of St. <hi>Paul, I know HOW to be abaſed.</hi> And to attend her,

(—with the Curt'ſy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd) to a Gentleman that a while ago laid his

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>

                  <p>'TIS the Opinion of me, and of many that the two Letters, I
incloſe, may paſs with Advantage thro' your Hands to the Publick. If too
long, abridge 'em as you think fit. I was at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> when I reciv'd
both from <hi>Maecenas,</hi> who I muſt tell you, is a Gentleman of the <hi>Temple,</hi> that won't permit me to ſay more of him; nor need I to a
Perſon, of <hi>your</hi> Taſte and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, that can read the Soul
of a Man in his Letters.</p>
                  <p>BE juſt, Sir, to ſuch a remarkable Piece of Generoſity as this
of <hi>Amaſius,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World, that it is not only an
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common <hi>Generoſity,</hi> but an uncommon <hi>good Senſe</hi>; a good
Senſe, perhaps, which a <pb n="442" facs="tcp:0199100801:451"/> great many <hi>fooliſh</hi>
People have not a <hi>Notion of,</hi> and which a great many wiſe ones have <hi>only</hi> a Notion of.</p>
                  <p>THE like Conduct to this of <hi>Amaſius,</hi> was t'other Day,
that of <hi>THEODOSIA,</hi> a Lady of an amiable Character, and of a very
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Family and Fortune. She has had a long and intimate Knowledge
of <hi>Honeſtus,</hi> and of All his Good Qualities. She has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard,
often ſeen, what a kind Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band he made to his Wiſe, whom he has lately
loſt, and with her an Eſtate, that was all he had to ſubſiſt upon. He
had met with many Adverſities, many Trials before. But this was the
greateſt. He bore it man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; hoping, truſting, reſting, firmly and
chearfully, in an Almighty Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Providence. With this
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, he made a friendly Viſit to his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in the Country;
among the reſt, to <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> who receiv'd him kindly, and pity'd
him. He there fell ill of a Fever, during which, ſhe gave him a Thouſand
Proofs of her Tenderneſs! and, after he had recover'd, added this to the
Number of 'em, <hi>She Married him</hi>—Not without the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of her
beſt Friends and Relations.—</p>
                  <p>THIS is the Character of <hi>Honeſtus</hi>; a great deal of <hi>Merit,</hi> but, withal, a great deal of <hi>Poverty,</hi> and <hi>Four
Children</hi> along with it. For <hi>this</hi> ſhe's reflected on. Cruel
World! thus to treat the generous <hi>Theodoſia</hi>! And thus to treat her, <hi>becauſe</hi> ſhe is generous! <pb n="443" facs="tcp:0199100801:452"/>—Cruelty
itſelf! But incourage her, I beſeech you, Sir, and let it be <hi>your</hi>
Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity to ſay all you can in behalf of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſia</hi>'s.</p>

            <p>WE regard not Rivals in <hi>Love,</hi> with more Malice than Rivals in <hi>Fame:</hi> And the ſofter Sex, is moſt liable to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant

               <hi>WIT</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> are the Arms
they conquer by; It is with Jealouſy, therefore, that they behold them in any

a Reproach: And <hi>her</hi> Soul muſt be ſublimely Great, who, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerves with Pleaſure, the Fame and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, of a powerful Rival; but
contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes her own Endeavours, to the Support, and Increaſe of them!</p>
            <p>I HAVE been led into theſe Reflections, by the Delight, with which,
I perus'd the following Letter, and Copy of Verſes, which were lately ſent
me, by a Lady, who has either too much Generoſity, to malign the Excellence
and Applauſe of others: Or too large a Share of both, herſelf, to be

                  <p>I HAVE found, That your Paper has a Power to move the Soul; and
holds a Command over the Paſſions. Your PLAIN DEALER on <hi>Death,</hi> is
one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Beauty. He ought, methinks, to <hi>live</hi> for ever, who can
make <hi>Death</hi> ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable. While I was reading in it, all Vanity,
and Love of Life forſook me.—My Eyes reſign'd themſelves to Tears:
and I even ſeem'd to <hi>feel</hi> the Grave. The beautiful Verſe glided
through my Veins; and I trembled, with a <hi>pleaſing Horror.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="445" facs="tcp:0199100801:454"/> WHILE my Mind was, thus delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſadden'd, Death depriv'd me of a <hi>perfect Friend,</hi> to whoſe dear
Memory, I have devoted the Lines inclos'd. They have little Beauty, but the
Truth and Paſſion of my Concern. Perhaps, <hi>That</hi> will plead their
Pardon.</p>
                  <p>THE Lady, whoſe Loſs I lament, was an Ornament to one Sex; and
the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Admiration of the other. I wonder, a Death, ſo
conſiderable, appears ſo little deplor'd.—Where is <hi>Friendſhip?</hi>—Was it buried, in <hi>Delia</hi>'s Grave? Let me
invoke it, to lament her.—<hi>She</hi> who cou'd, ſo gracefully, <hi>mourn,</hi> let <hi>us</hi> mourn <hi>her.</hi>—She, who cou'd give <hi>Life</hi> to our Imagination, let us be ſorry for her <hi>Death,</hi> and
aſſiſt her Fame, by our Gratitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>YOU,</hi> Sir, who know how to Charm your Readers, as you
pleaſe, I wiſh, you would chuſe this inſpiring Subject of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> Its divine Spirit is too much confin'd among Perſons
of narrow Natures.—As for me, I am not inſenſible of it: I feel its
Power at my Heart; but can't do Juſtice in expreſſing it.—The
Deſcent to <hi>Age,</hi> and <hi>Affliction,</hi> is ſmooth'd and
ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd, by the Aid of <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> It rebates the Edge of
ſharpeſt Miſeries. We ſeem <hi>not to grow Old,</hi> when we have a <hi>Friend,</hi> to make Life taſteful to us: Time flies over us, indeed; but
he ſeems to bruſh us with downy Wings; and marks his Way, with ſlight
Impreſſions.</p>

                     <pb n="446" facs="tcp:0199100801:455"/> WHEN I ſee a Face, more ſerene, or more
lovely, than uſual, I take Pleaſure to imagine, ſhe owes her Sweetneſs,
to the Influence of ſome charming Friend's Society. The Soul is quicken'd in
its Energy, by the Power of ſo divine a Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor ſhares, nor
laments, the <hi>Body</hi>'s Miſeries.</p>
                  <p>EXCUSE the Fullneſs of my Heart, on this favourite Subject: And I
will be frank enough to own, that I am ſometimes bleſt, with a Friend; of <hi>your</hi> Sex, too: And, while I have the Joy of liſtening to his
Wiſdom, methinks, we have already paſs'd the <hi>Grave,</hi> and are
enjoying the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of <hi>Heaven.</hi>

Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's Honour, to prove them alſo the moſt <hi>Witty.</hi> And, that
they are moſt <hi>Wiſe,</hi> we are under a Political Neceſſity of
maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe no Remark is more obvious to Foreigners, than, that the
Superiority of our Women's Talents, has almoſt univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the
Sex, in this happy Corner of the World, to a Right of Governing their
Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>
            <p>BUT when I come to ſpeak of the <hi>Wit</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies, I will not do 'em the Injuſtice of comparing them
with our Male Poets.—There was a <hi>Corinna</hi> among the Antients, who
carried away the Prize of Poetry from the Immortal <hi>Pindar</hi>
himſelf.—To write better than the <hi>Men,</hi> therefore, is a Triumph
below the Genius of ſome of our Female Wits, whom I could name, ſince other
Women have been already, <hi>ſo far</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors in other Nations. But,
if I match our modern Muſes, againſt the <hi>Sappho</hi>'s, and <hi>Corinna's</hi> of Antiquity, and they ſhall be victorious over thoſe
fam'd Victors, That, indeed will be a Glory.</p>

Excellence of Three <pb n="450" facs="tcp:0199100801:459"/> 
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies, who are
all now living; And whoſe Writings ſhall be tryed, in a moſt impartial
Compariſon, with the fineſt, and moſt celebrated Remnants of Female
Genius, which have been preſerv'd and wonder'd at, through a Length of
applauding Ages.—And, I doubt not, but I ſhall make it demonſtrable,
in thoſe Three Papers; that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies have excell'd the
Antients, in the <hi>Depth,</hi> the <hi>Tenderneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> of their Compoſitions.</p>

            <p>IN a Coffee-Room, the other Day, where the Converſation turn'd on
Wit, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was taking Pains to draw an odd kind of Demonſtration, from
the Liſt of Subſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Tranſlation of
Homer,</hi> That there never was an Age ſo favourable to Poets, 
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:0199100801:460"/> as <hi>This</hi>:—And, That, from the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of
our <hi>Noble Patrons,</hi> the Glorious Reign of King <hi>George</hi> will
ſhine brighter to Poſterity than the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus
Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH I love Loyalty, at my Heart, and am as conſcious as I ought
to be of the Influences of His Majeſty's Glory, yet, I confeſs, I was a
little ſtartled, at the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of this Aſſertion; and expreſs'd my
Surprize, with ſome Emotion.—I find then, cry'd I, that I have lived in
profound Ignorance!—As for the <hi>Politicks</hi> indeed of the preſent
Age, I have always conſider'd 'em as too <hi>remarkable</hi> to be ſoon <hi>forgot</hi>: But, for the <hi>Wit</hi> of it, I was in Hopes, there cou'd
be no Danger of its being <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT ſeems, continued I, the ſevereſt Miſery of Men of Learning,
that Cuſtom has miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to depend, for their Encouragment, on thoſe <hi>Great,</hi> Little, Creatures, whom we call <hi>People of
Quality.</hi>—Were Wiſdom the Conſequence of Riches, Rank, and Power,
it had been prudent, and reaſonable, for Merit in Diſtreſs to apply
itſelf to the <hi>Mighty.</hi>—But, ſince the Flattery, and
Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in which Thoſe called <hi>Great Men,</hi> are educated, muſt
give Liberty to their <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and Reſtraint to their <hi>Intellects,</hi> (for Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is ſcarce neceſſary to Men who
can pay others, to think for them!) therefore, with due Regard to a few
ſhining Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a Lord is <hi>above Wit</hi>: And moſt of 'em 
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:0199100801:461"/> wou'd have found it more to their Taſte, and their
Talent, to ſubſcribe to <hi>Heidegger,</hi> than to <hi>Homer,</hi> but
that the numerous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of this fine, and happy Genius united
themſelves, ſo powerfully, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Tranſlation, that, to be out
of the Liſt, was to be out of the <hi>Faſhion:</hi> which Misfortune, no
Doubt, it was well worth <hi>Six Guineas,</hi> to be delivered from the
Diſgrace of — But, let me ſee theſe ſhining Names to Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s <hi>Miſcellaneous Tracts,</hi> which he is now publiſhing
by a Subſcription, ſcarce the Sixth Part ſo chargeable, and I will
afterwards, ſuppoſe, that They can <hi>read,</hi> as well as <hi>purchaſe.</hi>—This, however, is what I know them too well to
expect at their Hands, unleſs Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> ſhall become as much <hi>The Mode</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is.</p>
            <p>I WAS ſurpriz'd to obſerve, that at my Mention of Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> almoſt every Perſon preſent, join'd in a Clamour
againſt <hi>Criticks.</hi> They affirm'd, <hi>Thus it was but juſt, to
neglect the Writings of a Perſon, who only writes, to cenſure Others.</hi>
And, <hi>That the World ſhou'd, without Regard to a Critick's Learning,
declare War, againſt his Malice; and treat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him, as a King of
Common Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I CONTENTED myſelf with ſmiling, at the Extravagance of this
Reaſoning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That I doubted hot, however, but the Name of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> would be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s <hi>Subſcribers</hi>; becauſe He has <hi>Soul</hi> to know, That though
Living Merit, <pb n="453" facs="tcp:0199100801:462"/> may ſometimes, as in his own Caſe, be
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, yet Popularity is ſo far from being the <hi>Mark</hi> of Living
Merit, that Real Excellence, for the moſt Part, both <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>diſdains</hi> it.</p>
            <p>IN the Progreſs of my Papers, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to examine into the
Foundation of this ſilly Notion, <hi>That Criticks are Enemies to Wit and
Learning:</hi> And I dare be poſitive, before-hand, that I ſhall diſcover
it to take its Riſe from a Cauſe, of the ſame Nature with that, which
makes the <hi>Pickpocket</hi> hate the <hi>Horſepond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO pretend a Love of Learning, and at the ſame Time io diſpiſe
Criticiſm, is as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous an Abſurdity, as to delight in noble
Buildings, and exclaim againſt Architecture.—If there is not ſome <hi>Rule,</hi> whereby we are to meaſure <hi>Wit,</hi> then Wit has no
Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Reaſon, and the Judgment; and, to be a <hi>Wit,</hi> or a <hi>Fool,</hi> are in that Caſe, Terms Synonimous.—But, if Wit is to be
judg'd, by the Examination of our Reaſon, then that Reaſon is <hi>Criticiſm</hi>: And he, who is a Critick, is the Champion of Wit, and
defends it from Prophanation.—How can he, therefore, be the <hi>Enemy,</hi> of what is ſupported by his Influence?</p>
            <p>THE true Friends of Learning ought to be cautious, how they give up <hi>Criticks</hi>; leſt, to free themſelves from a preſent Fear, they
deſtroy their future Hope, and fall into Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, under the Growth of
aſſuming Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: <pb n="454" facs="tcp:0199100801:463"/> Like the Degenerate <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, who ſlackening the Severity of their old mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Diſcipline, came at length, ſays <hi>Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> to think Helmets and
Corſlets too <hi>hot</hi> for them.—They were cumberſome and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable:—They <hi>fainted</hi> under the <hi>Weight</hi> of
'em:—And had Courage enough, they were ſure, to fight, as
ſucceſsfully without 'em.—They tried it: And the Conſequence was,
They were never, from that Time forward, able to ſtand, againſt the <hi>Arrows</hi> of the over-numbering <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi>: So
depriv'd of their Defence, they loſt their Empire to <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, ſince no Truth operates ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as that which
convinces by Example, let the Good, or Ill, of Criticiſm be decided, in fair
Combat, between the Gentleman I have nam'd above, who profeſſes, and forms
himſelf on it; and one of our moſt rapid, and voluminous Compilers of
Poetry; who tho' one wou'd imagine him too <hi>heavy</hi> to <hi>ride
Poſt;</hi> yet, truſting wholly to Inſpiration, breaks over Hedges and
Ditches, and never checks his Horſe's <hi>Speed,</hi> whether <hi>out</hi> of
the Road, or <hi>in</hi> it.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Merchant Adventurer</hi> was for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing Trade to
Himſelf: And began with firing the Magazines of Thoſe who dealt in the
ſame Commodity.—One of his firſt <hi>witty Performances,</hi> was, A <hi>Satire againſt Wit.</hi>—An Accident befell me, the other Day, that
may furniſh him with Matter of Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. <pb n="455" facs="tcp:0199100801:464"/> I am very
fond of a <hi>Cat</hi>: And, ever ſince I lodg'd in <hi>Barbican,</hi> have
delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Society of a Tabby Favourite of my Landlady's Children. But,
it happen'd, a few Days ſince, that, not being in a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to be ſo
familiar with her as uſual, ſhe open'd one of her Claws, and was pleas'd to
ſcratch my Leg, with no ſmall Freedom, and Impertinence: Upon which, in
great Wrath, I took her up, by the Tail, and toſs'd her out of
Window.—The Cat got no Harm: but I have quite loſt her Heart upon it.
And <hi>now,</hi> I may call, coax, and tempt her, as much as I pleaſe, ſhe
keeps, always, out out of my Reach: And I dare be poſitive, I ſhall never <hi>catch</hi> her, though I were to <hi>live and die in Barbican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, to go on, with what I propos'd.—After his <hi>Satire
againſt Wit,</hi> he ſet forth <hi>his Wit againſt Satire</hi>; and
publiſh'd an <hi>Epic Poem,</hi> call'd PRINCE ARTHUR.—The Excellent
Critick, abovenam'd, ſaw, upon peruſing this Piece, that the Gentleman
wanted Skill and Application, in the Art he was bent on practiſing. He put
himſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the Trouble of compoſing, for his Uſe, a juſt,
and generous Reprehenſion, which he intitled, <hi>Remarks upon Prince
Arthur.</hi>—Had the Author been either humble, or wiſe, enough to make
Advantage by it, This wou'd have ſerv'd him as a Plan, to build ſtronger,
for the future; and given a Turn to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, that might have made him,
him <pb n="456" facs="tcp:0199100801:465"/> what he had ſo earneſt a Deſire to paſs
for.</p>
            <p>BUT it was, then, as it is now, the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to deſpiſe a
Critick. And the Author of <hi>Prince Arthur</hi> fell, ſo couragiouſly,
into the Faſhion, that in almoſt His Coach-Load of <hi>Epic Poems,</hi>
which he has, ſince oblig'd the World with, from <hi>Arthur,</hi> down to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi> (I ſpeak it without Compliment) The ſame
diſtinguiſhable Purity, Fire, Elegance, Fancy, Copiouſneſs, and
Elevation, ſhine, alike, in every one of 'em: And, All, are equally ſecure,
as well from Criticiſm, as Imitation.</p>
            <p>BUT, not content with raiſing, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Human</hi> Nature,
He aſpir'd, at laſt, to write, upon <hi>Divinity Itſelf.</hi>—The
Great Almighty, and His <hi>Works,</hi> were, now, to be the Subject of his
practis'd Panegyrick.—Here, ſure! if ever, He was to guard himſelf
with Caution, and put on the Critick's Armour.—<hi>Creation</hi> opened
to him, with its boundleſs Luſtre!—Worlds beyond Worlds, were to be
diſcover'd, by his Poetic Teleſcope: And <hi>other Suns,</hi> whoſe <hi>Light</hi> (tho' ſwift enough, to travel a Hundred and Fourſcore
thouſand Miles, in one <hi>Second</hi> of Time, is notwithſtanding,
ſpent, and loſt, in unconceivable Immenſity, before it reaches, <hi>This,</hi> our own, <hi>Sun</hi>'s Confines!) <hi>This Light</hi> was to be <hi>more Illuminated,</hi> by His Muſe, and ſhine down, upon his Reader's
Fancy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:0199100801:466"/>HERE, the admirable Critick, his old Friend,
had, Himſelf, ſet an Example; ſuch, as can never be too much
applauded.—The nobleſt, the moſt extenſive, the moſt
aſtoniſhing Ideas, which can expand the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Soul, had inrich'd his
powerful Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And one wou'd have hop'd, that Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> had
made it impoſſible for any future Writer to treat this Subject, in a mean
and groveling Manner; after he had oblig'd the World, ſo nobly, in his <hi>Paraphraſe on Te Deum,</hi> with Verſe, and Sentiments, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limely

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOUR Paper of <hi>Friday</hi> the 28th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> is
arrived in <hi>North-Britain,</hi> and has occaſioned much Speculation; but
all its Readers are ſenſibly obliged, by the <pb n="462" facs="tcp:0199100801:471"/>
Reſpect you have ſhewn our Country, and for the Honour you have done the
riſing Generation of both Sexes; and I believe, there is none here, who would
not heartily join their Acknowledgements with mine on this Occaſion. I may
therefore preſume to thank you in the Name of all my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who may not
uſe the Freedom to write to you: But the Gentlemen of the <hi>Groteſque
Club,</hi> whom you have ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſtinguiſh'd, muſt repreſent
their Sentiments, in a better Manner than I can; and I will not pretend to
ſpeak their Senſe, or anticipate their Gratitude.</p>
                  <p>GIVE me Leave, SIR, only to expreſs my Mind in the Sequel. You
have brought me under ſtrong Obligations to you, by the Notice you have taken
of my Letter. And ſince you ſeem to promiſe to yourſelf, and the World,
ſome Intelligence from this Quarter, by means of my propos'd
Correſpondence; I cannot but uſe my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to anſwer, in ſome
Meaſure, your Expectations. You have fix'd me, SIR, in the Character of your <hi>Northern Spy,</hi> and you may depend upon my moſt watchful Fidelity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>EDINBURGH</hi> being our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and the Place of
my Reſidence, muſt be the chief Scene of Action, and the Date of your
Intelligence from <hi>North-Britain.</hi> Here is a vaſt Variety of Humours,
Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Manners, and Converſation, to be <pb n="463" facs="tcp:0199100801:472"/>
conſidered. Many Things happen in this Place, that are worthy your Knowledge
as a PLAIN-DEALER. Some deſerve Praiſe and Admiration, others
Diſpleaſure and Reprehenſion; both Regards may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, either as
Examples provoking Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, as Reaſons, warning from Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: And
ſure, your Judgment, SIR, cannot err, in the Improvement and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, of
any Accounts I ſend you.</p>
                  <p>I BEG leave to lay before you, ſeveral of the Advantages, and
Diſadvantages of our good Town, before I deſcend to Private Life.</p>
                  <p>WE are bleſt with an able and active <hi>Magiſtracy.</hi> Moſt
of Thoſe intruſted with with the Superintendency of the City, are Gentlemen
of Breeding and Letters, and all have a Bent of Mind, that favours the Publick
Grandeur and Emolument. It ſeems to be the united Ambition of our
Magiſtrates to adorn the Place, and by rendring it more beautiful and
commodious, to invite new Inhabitants, to increaſe its Treaſure and
Revenue. They would ſurmount all the Difficulties it labours under, by a
Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Genius: And, as they appear true Friends to the Publick
Intereſt, in reſpect of <hi>Trade</hi>; they are not wanting in giving
Countenance and Encouragement to <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences.</hi>
Politeneſs thrives under their Influence, and ſome of them ſet an
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it to the Youth, in their own <pb n="464" facs="tcp:0199100801:473"/> Practice and
Behaviour. Here, SIR, are few cloudy, heavy-headed Aldermen, whoſe Length of
Wigs and Gowns, is their ſole Mark of Dignity. You would take our <hi>Provoſts</hi> for Firſt Miniſters, and our <hi>Bailies</hi> for
Courtiers. I have ſeen <hi>Stateſmen,</hi> make a worſe Figure than our <hi>Deacons,</hi> and heard as good Speeches in the <hi>Town-Council</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as at the Council-Board of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> I wiſh
all our <hi>Peers</hi> had Abilities equal to ſome of our <hi>Weavers,</hi>
and that every <hi>Clergyman,</hi> had half the Grace of ſome <hi>Bonnet-Makers</hi> of our City.</p>
                  <p>BUT, SIR, you know there is no <hi>Body-Politick,</hi> perfect; many
Things are wanting, to make our City more flouriſhing and fam'd. And,
perhaps, the greateſt Misfortune we labour under, is Faction and Party. This,
SIR, diſcourages many noble Purpoſes, and baffles glorious Undertakings.
Self-Love, Pride and Ambition, prevail every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and ſway all Men, more or
leſs: Theſe are natural to all Creatures. The Oldeſt Cock is Lord of the
Rooſt, and the ſtrongeſt Bull is <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> in his green <hi>Seraglio</hi>; the eldeſt Buck is Tyrant of the Park, and, from his
Strength and his Horns claims a Right to be Chief in Power; and, no doubt, but
every individual Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of every Species, with the ſame Force, would
ſeek and exerciſe the ſame Juriſdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. But Men are remarkably
diſtinguiſhed, <pb n="465" facs="tcp:0199100801:474"/> by their Love of Precedency, and
often add, to their natural Deſire of Governing, a certain low-ſpirited
Spleen and Malice. Our worthy Magiſtrates, meet with more Oppoſition and
Diſcouragment, from little Pretenders to their Place and Authority, than from
any other Cauſe. If the Town-Council, beholds not <hi>Macro,</hi> with the
ſame Partiality, with which he conſiders himſelf, he wonders at their
Blindneſs, and grows <hi>peeviſh</hi> upon it; for the Root of the Spleen,
is often <hi>Pride diſappointed.</hi> Some carry it farther than mere <hi>Envy,</hi> by labouring to undermine and depoſe thoſe who are above
them, and commonly the greater the Merit is, the more obnoxious to Ill-will and
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. As the <hi>Red Dragon</hi> purſued the Woman in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Faction or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Malice, purſues the moſt
deſerving Man; and when it cannot overtake him, it opens its Mouth, and <hi>throws a Flood after him</hi>: People who have not Merit to riſe
themſelves, would at leaſt level others. And what has often been my
greateſt Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in this Caſe, is, that moſt of our little Jars, are
created and carried on by our <hi>Clergy.</hi> Prieſt-Craft is here, as <hi>Infallible</hi> as it is at <hi>Rome,</hi> and our <hi>Popes</hi> are as <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,</hi> to the full Extent of their <hi>Pariſhes.</hi> For my
own Part, I have neither Perſonal Partiality for any of the preſent
Magiſtrates, nor Prejudice againſt their Adverſaries: I never had, nor
ever needed the Favour of any <pb n="466" facs="tcp:0199100801:475"/> of them. I ſpeak my
Senſe freely, and it is the Reſult of juſt Reflexion, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
And I heartily wiſh, I had not ſuch Ground, to expoſe the Spirits of any
of my Neighbours, to the <hi>Plain-Dealer.</hi> But what a Pity is it, that
Faction ſhould deface the Publick Good? And how vile, to plot the Downfal, or
calumniate the Fame of Thoſe, whoſe Power is their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's
Bleſſing?</p>
                  <p>MY Concern for the Place of my Birth, has carried me farther than I
ought to have allow'd myſelf Liberty; but as I am not to touch this Subject
again, you will have the Goodneſs to excuſe, what I judg'd, in ſome
reſpects, to be requiſite.</p>
                  <p>I SHOULD not neglect giving you an Account of the State of <hi>Trade</hi> in this Place nor ought I to paſs over in Silence, the <hi>Univerſity</hi> and <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Juſtices.</hi> Many of the <hi>Clergy</hi> too, deſerve their Praiſes, and muſt, upon ſome
Occaſions, come under Conſideration: But being unwilling to tire your
Patience, and huddle my Materials too much together, I will conclude this
Letter, when I have acquainted you with what the <hi>Ladies</hi> would have <hi>moſt known,</hi> and what every Body here would be glad to have your
Opinion of: I mean, The FAIR ASSEMBLY. This, SIR, conſiſts of our
beſt-bred Ladies, of different Qualities and Ages: 'Tis but a late
Inſtitution, and at firſt, was thought to be a proper Theme 
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:0199100801:476"/> for our <hi>Paſtors Sunday</hi> Sermons; all our
Pulpits rail'd againſt it, as they did, of Old, againſt <hi>Perukes</hi>
and <hi>Tobacco.</hi> But the holy Fire is now much ſpent, and we are at
Liberty to meet in our great Hall, without Danger of the <hi>Kirk</hi>'s <hi>Anathema</hi>; nay, ſome of the Wives and Daughters of the <hi>Sanctified,</hi> begin of late, to grace our Fellowſhip. For my own Part,
I deſpair not to ſee the <hi>Reverend</hi> themſelves, eating Sweatmeats
in our Company: And mixing innocently, in our Country Dances. And I own,
notwithſtanding they are worthy Ladies, of undiſputed Virtue and Honour,
who preſide over the <hi>Fair Aſſembly,</hi> I ſhould be better
pleaſed to ſee at our Head, a <hi>Moderator</hi> from the <hi>General
One.</hi> Slander and Detraction would fly before him, and innocent Freedom,
and Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion wou'd be cheriſhed by his Influence. Husbands
would allow their Wives to go into Company, without Jealouſy, and Parants
ſend their Daughters, without fear of their leaving behind them any thing,
that they ought to bring back again. But till that <hi>Halcyon</hi> Day
arrives, we muſt be contented with the want of <hi>Sanction,</hi> and dance,
and drink Tea without them. I ſhall ſay more of our <hi>Fair
Aſſembly</hi> hereafter, and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent only ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I RETURN you Thanks for the Pleaſure which I have received from
ſeveral of your <hi>Plain Dealers,</hi> and particularly from that which you
lately publiſhed concerning <hi>Detraction,</hi> which could never have
obliged the World at a more ſeaſonable Juncture; becauſe, as you juſtly
obſerve, Slander was never ſo prevailing, as 'tis at preſent, and never
ſo inſupportable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>DETRACTION,</hi> or <hi>Slander,</hi> or <hi>Calumny,</hi> call
it by what Name you pleaſe, is, for the moſt part, begot by <hi>Knaves,</hi> and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, and maintain'd, by <hi>Fools</hi>; and the 
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0199100801:478"/> more Fools and Knaves, there are, in a Nation, the more
muſt Slander flouriſh in it; but the more corrupt and degenerate a Nation
grows, the more Fools and Knaves muſt abound in it. Now, whether this Nation
was ever ſo corrupt and degenerate, as it is at preſent, I leave to others
to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
                  <p>THE Fools, and Knaves, of either Sex, have a natural Averſion to <hi>Merit,</hi> and when they are neither able, nor willing, to reach a Height,
to which others, more befriended by Nature, and more beloved by Heaven, have
attained, they conſtantly endeavour, with all their Might, to bring the
envied Object down to their own Pitch: And, the more extraordinary the <hi>Merit</hi> is, the greater is the <hi>Envy,</hi> and the ſtronger the
Efforts, which it makes, to blacken the Deſerving: Which has occaſioned a
famous Obſerver of Mankind to ſay, That when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he <hi>hears</hi> a great
deal of <hi>Ill</hi> ſaid of any one, and ſees none at all in him, he
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſuſpect, that <hi>That</hi> Perſon has a troubleſome and
offenſive <hi>Merit,</hi> which eclipſes that of others.</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as a Knave has invented a Slander, a Fool cries out, <hi>There muſt be ſomething in it,—There is no Smoak</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Fire</hi>: Which is as much as to ſay, that there can be no ſuch Thing
as <hi>Slander</hi>; or, that no Slander can be <hi>propagated</hi>; which is
equally contrary to common Senſe, and <pb n="470" facs="tcp:0199100801:479"/> to conſtant
Matter of Fact.—How different an Opinion of this Matter, had the
judicious, and penetrating, <hi>La Bruyere,</hi> who tells us, That <hi>the
Reverſe of what is commonly reported, concerning Perſons, or Things, is
what may reaſonably be believ'd of either.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE is another muſty Proverb, made uſe of in the Propagation
of <hi>Slander,</hi> which is mention'd in your laſt Paper, <hi>viz. That,
what Every-Body ſays, muſt be true.</hi>—If they, who pronounce <hi>this,</hi> meant, that <hi>Every thing muſt be True which has the
univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Conſent of Mankind,</hi> there might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be ſomething
in it; but, alas! their Meaning is vaſtly different: They only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, That <hi>when a Report, or Opinion, in any Place, ſo far prevails, as to become,
in that Place, general, that Report, or Opinion, muſt be true.</hi> So that,
in the Notion of theſe Gentlemen, If Calumny, at any Time, ſo far prevails,
as to become <hi>General,</hi> 'tis no longer <hi>Calumny,</hi> but <hi>Truth</hi>; and a ſure Conſequence of this Doctrine is, That <hi>Popery</hi> is the <hi>beſt</hi> Religion at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT, how little do they, who talk, at this Rate, know, either of the
Frailty, or Malignity, of Human Nature, or the Tranſactions of their own
Times, or the Records of preceding ones? Some of the beſt, and moſt
deſerving Perſons, both among Ancients, and Moderns, have labour'd 
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:0199100801:480"/> under general Calumny; under Calumnies which were not
only inconſiſtent with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, but were directly contradictory of
thoſe Virtues, and great Qualities, for which they had long been eminent, and
for which ſome of them have been celebrated, by <hi>Twenty ſucceeding
Centuries;</hi> and tho' the Truth was ſo manifeſtly on their Side, yet
ſome of theſe, and thoſe of the <hi>moſt deſerving,</hi> have been
quite <hi>oppreſs'd</hi> by ſuch Calumnies; as <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Phocion,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Graecians.</hi>—Among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Camillus,</hi> and <hi>Coriolanus.</hi>—<hi>SOCRATES,</hi> the moſt
Religious, and moſt Virtuous, of all the <hi>Athenians,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
and excuted, as an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and a <hi>Corrupter of Youth.</hi> Among
the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Prophets were <hi>ſton'd,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> Himſelf, was crucify'd as an <hi>Impoſter,</hi> and a <hi>Blaſphemer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>YOU have, very juſtly obſerv'd, That Detraction brings moſt
Diſquiet, to thoſe who are moſt above it.—You may ſay ſuch
Things, without any Conſequence, to a worthleſs Fellow, as will blow a Man
of Honour into a Flame, not to be quench'd, but by Blood. But, if ſuch
Injuries are ſo inſupportable, to a Man of Honour, when they come from one
ſingle Perſon, provok'd, perhaps, by ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Offence, and quite
frantick, with Paſſion, and Wine; what Impreſſions muſt they not
make, when they are whiſper'd <pb n="472" facs="tcp:0199100801:481"/> in cold Blood, by a
Number of different Perſons? Such Slanders obſtruct the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of
Arts, the Advancement of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Growth of Virtues, by the killing
Impreſſions, which they make, on Individuals.—I wiſh you would
proceed to ſhow, what Diſorder they bring to Families and what Deſolation
to States. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was undone, and <hi>Carthage</hi> was ruin'd, by
the malicious <hi>Slanders</hi> of <hi>Hanno</hi>; and the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi>'s unparallel'd Victories cou'd not defend him againſt
Ingratitude, while the Malice of his Slanderers met with Countenance from Men
in <hi>Power,</hi> who, being, privately, his Enemies, had not <hi>Soul</hi>
enough to ſacrifice their <hi>little Spleen</hi> to the Love of their <hi>Country</hi>'s <hi>Glory.</hi>

               <hi>DETRACTION</hi> is an Evil, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hateful in its Nature,
the World muſt always expect to abound with. And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince my
Correſpondent has written ſo much, and ſo well, in Deteſtation of this
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous Weakneſs, all I will add, upon the Subject, ſhall be, to
adviſe thoſe who ſuffer under the Severity of its Conſequences, rather
to <hi>deſpiſe,</hi> than <hi>complain of</hi> it. To which End, they wou'd
do well to reflect on <pb n="473" facs="tcp:0199100801:482"/> the Anſwer of the Philoſopher,
whom his Friends were urging to contrive ſome publick Means, whereby to
redeem himſelf from the Diſgrace which he ſuffer'd, under the Malice of
ſome buſy Slanderers.—<hi>They who love me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>will
give no Credit to malicious Rumours, to my Diſadvantage: And, as for thoſe
who hate me, I will live, in a Manner ſo contrary to what they believe of me,
that I will make 'em aſham'd of their Credulity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT very <hi>Socrates,</hi> which my Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſo juſtly
produces, as one of the moſt glorious of all the <hi>Victims</hi> to <hi>Slander,</hi> triumph'd over it, in the very Current and full Force, of its
Influence. For when <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> in his Comedy, call'd, The <hi>Clouds,</hi> had expos'd this great, and virtuous Sufferer, with the
utmoſt Bitterneſs of <hi>witty Malice,</hi> to the publick Spleen of the <hi>Athenians, Socrates</hi> came, in Perſon, to ſee the Comedy acted; and,
taking his Place in the moſt remarkable Part of the Theatre, ſtood up, and
expoſing himſelf to the Obſervation of the whole Audience, told 'em,
aloud, when the Play was over, that, <hi>They had been at a merry Feaſt,
where He was ſerv'd up, for their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; nor was he angry, to have
been their ſtanding Diſh, becauſe the Averſion which ſome had brought
with them, wou'd laſt no longer than till they had taſted him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE it is inſeparable from Merit, to be expos'd to <hi>Envy,</hi>
and Envy neceſſarily produces <hi>Slander,</hi> there is no hoping to live 
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:0199100801:483"/> free, from the Effects of this pernicious <hi>Calumny.</hi> But, next to not feeling it the moſt deſirable Strength
of Mind, is, <hi>Not to appear to feel it.</hi>—One of theſe is out of
our Reach; the other we may attain, by Force of Reaſon, and Reſolution: And
its prettily obſerv'd, in <hi>Aelian,</hi> (aſſerting that Defamation
ſinks deepeſt in weak Natures) <hi>The Slander of the</hi> Strong <hi>is
like Water thrown againſt a Wall; but the Slander of the</hi> Weak <hi>is
like the Wall thrown into Water.</hi>

            <p>I HAVE lately received a Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome Remarks on the
Battle of the Angels, as 'tis deſcrib'd by <hi>Milton</hi> in the VIth Book
of his <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> and I thought I could not find a more proper
Occaſion of publiſhing that Letter, than juſt after the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> on the 29th of the laſt Month, which was ſet apart by the
Church to celebrate the Victory which that Arch-Angel got over <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and his rebellious Crew. I make no Doubt, but it will
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <pb n="476" facs="tcp:0199100801:485"/> that <hi>Milton,</hi> by the Account which he
has given of that Victory, has gained a very glorious one himſelf, and has
carried away the Praiſe of Sublimity from all Poets, both Antient and
Modern.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>OF all the Commentators on the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe Loſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> was certainly the moſt ingenious, if he was not the moſt
learned; but he has not given <hi>Milton</hi> his full Due, either through want
of Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or want of Impartiality. In the 17th Page of the ſmall
Edition of his Notes upon the <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> he has theſe Words
of the Author:</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>MILTON's</hi> chief Talent, and, indeed, his diſtinguiſhing
Excellence, lies in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of his Thoughts. There are others of the
Moderns who rival him in every other Part of Poetry; but in the Greatneſs of
his Sentiments he triumphs over all the Poets, both Moderns and Antients, <hi>Homer</hi> only excepted.</q>
                  <p>BUT as when a Man departs from Truth, which is the only Bond of
Union and Agreement, both of our Sentiments with thoſe of others, and of our
Sentiments with themſelves, he his ready immediately to differ from, and to
grow inconſiſtent with himſelf; Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> who expreſly 
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:0199100801:486"/> here either equals or prefers <hi>Homer,</hi> for the
Greatneſs of his Sentiments, before <hi>Milton,</hi> contradicts himſelf at
leaſt, no leſs than twice in the Courſe of his Obſervations: For,
ſays he, in the 7th Page of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Edition, <hi>There is an
indiſputable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned Magnificence in every Part of</hi>
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe Loſt, <hi>and, indeed, a much greater than could have been formed
upon any</hi> Pagan <hi>Syſtem.</hi> Now if there is a greater Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
in every Part of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Poem, there is by Conſequence a greater
Sublimity, than there is in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> which was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a <hi>Pagan</hi> Syſtem.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN in the 92d Page of the foreſaid Edition, Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> ſpeaking of the Excellence of <hi>Milton</hi>'s
Performance in the Sixth Book of his Poem, delivers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus:</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>MILTON's</hi> Genius, which was ſo great in itſelf, and ſo
ſtrengthened by all the Helps of Learning, appears in this Book every way
equal to his Subject, which is the moſt ſublime that could enter into the
Thoughts of a Poet.</q>
                  <p>NOW, SIR, if <hi>Milton</hi>'s Subject is the moſt ſublime that
could enter into the Thoughts of a Poet, and his Genius is every way equal to
his Subject, it follows, That <hi>Milton</hi> is more exalted than any Poet who
has not a Subject ſo elevated, and, conſequently, than <hi>Homer,</hi> or
any other Poet antient or modern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="478" facs="tcp:0199100801:487"/> BUT, as in the 91ſt Page of the foreſaid
Comment, Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> takes a great deal of Pains to ſhew the
Greatneſs of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Paſſage of <hi>Homer,</hi> and to deſcribe
it, after <hi>Longinus,</hi> in all thoſe choſen Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which
may make it appear to be noble and exalted, which Pains he has not taken with
any other Paſſage, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude, that he believed this to
be the moſt lofty of any that are in the Works of <hi>Homer,</hi> as indeed
it really is: Now, as there is a Paſſage in the 6th Book of <hi>Paradiſe
Loſt,</hi> which was produced upon a parallel Occaſion, let us ſee if we
cannot find by comparing them, for the Honour of our Country, that the
Paſſage, of our <hi>Briton,</hi> is as much ſuperior to that of the <hi>Grecian,</hi> as the Angels of the one are more potent than the other's
Gods, or as the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrean</hi> Heaven is more exalted than <hi>Oſſa,
Pelion,</hi> or <hi>Olympus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN order to this, SIR, give me leave to lay before you the Words
which Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> makes Uſe of to ſet ſorth the maſterly
Strokes of <hi>Homer.</hi> After he has told us, That there is no Queſtion,
but that <hi>Milton</hi> had heated his Imagination with the Fight of the Gods
in <hi>Homer,</hi> before he entered upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of the Angels (of
which, by the Way, I do not believe one Syllable: I would ſooner believe the
greateſt Abſurdities of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>) he is pleaſed to add what
follows:</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="479" facs="tcp:0199100801:488"/>
                     <hi>HOMER</hi> there gives us a Scene of Men,
Heroes, and Gods, mixed together in Battle. <hi>Mars</hi> animates the
contending Armies, and lifts up his Voice in ſuch a Manner, that it is heard
diſtinctly amidſt all the Shouts and Confuſion of the Fight. <hi>Jupiter</hi> at the ſame Time thunders over their Heads; while <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> raiſes ſuch a Tempeſt, that the whole Field of Battle,
and all the Tops of the Mountains, ſhake about them. The Poet tells us, That <hi>Pluto</hi> himſelf, whoſe Habitation was in the very Center of the
Earth, was ſo affrighted at the Shock, that he leap'd from his Throne. <hi>Homer</hi> afterwards deſcribes <hi>Vulcan,</hi> as pouring down a Storm
of Fire upon the River <hi>Xanthus;</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> as throwing a
Rock at <hi>Mars,</hi> who he tells us covered Seven Acres in his Fall.</q>
                  <p>WITH theſe imaginary <hi>ne plus ultra's</hi> had Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> ſo filled his Capacity, that when Ten thouſand greater
Beauties are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eyes, he ſtops ſhort of them, and never in the
leaſt diſcerns them, as you will ſee immediately; for thus he goes
on:</p>
                  <q>AS <hi>Homer</hi> has introduced into his Battle of the Gods every
Thing that is great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in Nature, <hi>Milton</hi> has filled his
Fight af good and bad Angels, with all the like Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Horror. The
Shout of Armies, the Rattling of brazen Chariots, the Hurling of Rocks and
Mountains, the Earthquake, the Fire, <pb n="480" facs="tcp:0199100801:489"/> the Thunder, are
all of them imployed to lift up the Reader's Imagination, and give him a
ſuitable Idea of ſo great an Action. With what Art doth the Poet
repreſent the whole Body of the Earth trembling, even before it was
created?</q>
                  <p>THUS, with this very pretty trifling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, does Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> ſtop ſhort, within the very Touch of one of the
vaſteſt, and the ſublimeſt Beauties, that ever was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the
God of Verſe, or by <hi>Milton</hi>'s Godlike Genius; when the very next
Lines, the very next Words, ſtrike and aſtoniſh us with ſuch wonderful
Ideas, as are able to lift up the Reader's Imagination to a Thouſand Times a
greater Height, than either the Shout of Armies, the Rattling of brazen
Chariots, the Hurling of Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Earthquake, the Fire, or the
Thunder. But that theſe Beauties may be ſeen in all their Luſtre, and in
all their Glory, give me leave to ſet the whole Paſſage before you.</p>
                  <q> 
                     <l>Th' Arch-Angel's Trumpet through the Vaſt of Heav'n</l> 
                     <l>Reſounded, and the faithful Armies rung</l> 
                     <l>Hoſanna to the Higheſt: nor ſtood at gaze</l> 
                     <l>The adverſe Legions, nor leſs hideous join'd</l> 
                     <l>The horrid Shock; now ſtorming Fury roſe,</l> 
                     <l>And Clamour, ſuch as heard in Heav'n till now</l> 
                     <l>Was never; Arms on Armour claſhing, bray'd</l> 
                     <l>Horrible Diſcord, and the madding Wheels</l> 
                     <l>
                        <pb n="481" facs="tcp:0199100801:490"/>Of brazen Chariots rag'd; Dire was the
Noiſe</l> 
                     <l>Of Conflict: Over-head the diſmal Hiſs</l> 
                     <l>Of fiery Darts, in flaming Vollies, flew,</l> 
                     <l>And, flying, vaulted either Hoſt with Fire.</l> 
                     <l>So, under fiery Cope, together ruſh'd</l> 
                     <l>Both Battles main, with ruinous Aſſault,</l> 
                     <l>And inextinguiſhable Rage: All Heav'n</l> 
                     <l>Reſounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth</l> 
                     <l>Had to her Center ſhook: What Wonder! when</l> 
                     <l>Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought</l> 
                     <l>On either Side, the leaſt of whom could wield</l> 
                     <l>Theſe Elements, and arm him with the Force</l> 
                     <l>Of all the Regions?</l> 
                  </q>
                  <p>BUT now, Sir, if Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought on
either Side, and the very leaſt, the very weakeſt of ſo many Millions,
had Power to rend this Globe of Earth and Ocean from its Axle, and whirl it,
with its dependent Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, through the Aethereal Regions, what muſt be
the unutterable, the inconceivable Effect of ſo many Millions furiouſly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending againſt each other, and each of them exerting all his Might for
Victory? When, 
<q> 
                        <l>— Each on himſelf relied,</l> 
                        <l>As only on His Arm the Moment lay</l> 
                        <l>Of Victory.</l> 
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THESE are amazing, theſe are aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ideas, worthy of the
great Original Fight, the Battle of the <hi>Empyrean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="482" facs="tcp:0199100801:491"/> BUT now, Sir, if the leaſt, if the
weakeſt of ſo many Millions, as fought on either Side, had Strength to
remove this Globe of Earth, with its dependent Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what could not the
greateſt of them? what could not <hi>Lucifer</hi>? what could not the Prince
of the Arch-Angels, <hi>Michael</hi>'s next-to-Almighty Arm, do? The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lines, and our own Reflections on them may a little help to inform us.</p>
                  <q> 
                     <l>— Long time in even Scale</l> 
                     <l>The Battle hung, till Satan, who, that Day,</l> 
                     <l>Prodigious Pow'r had ſhewn, and met in Arms</l> 
                     <l>No Equal, ranging through the dire Attack</l> 
                     <l>Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length</l>
