            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p> I AM an unhappy Young Woman, that want a little of your
<hi>Plain Dealing,</hi> and good <hi>Advice,</hi> to help me out in an Affair
of the utmoſt Conſequence to my Peace. I am in too much pain, to make a
long In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction; therefore hope you will excuſe me, if I only ſend a
ſhort Sketch of my Misfortune, without ſtaying to pay my grateful Thanks,
for your agreeable Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Entertainments; which I can never enough Admire. I
hope you won't think me troubleſome, if I relate the exact Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of
Life, I at preſent am in. I live in a fine Old Seat in <hi>Surrey,</hi> which
wants nothing to render it delightful, to a Perſon of my Temper. Our Family
conſiſts of my Father (who is a Widower) an old Maiden Aunt, two Siſters,
and my Self. My Father is a very good Man, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys himſelf moſtly in
his Study. My Aunt is of a reſerv'd Temper, therefore ſuffers us to keep
but little Company, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with Gentlemen. There is only one Perſon
allow'd that fatal Liberty! Whoſe Character I muſt make you acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0199100802:4"/> with: But how, alas! ſhall I do that? Yet if there is
ſuch a Thing as Perfection in Mankind, he certainly is Maſter of it. He has
ſo fine an Underſtanding in all Arts and Sciences (allow'd by his own Sex)
ſo great a Knowledge in every thing that is Polite and Agreeable, and,
withal, ſo ſweet a Diſpoſition, that I only wonder, I kept my Heart
ſo long free from his irreſiſtable Charms! I have been pretty intimate
with him theſe Three Years, but did not know, 'till within theſe Three
Months, that my Happineſs or Miſery, depended intirely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. In
ſhort, I feel ſo violent a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in my Breaſt, that unleſs I
have ſome ſpeedy Relief, Death will ſoon put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to my Sorrow! How
often have I ſate contemplating his Virtues and Charms, 'till my Soul has
almoſt diſſolv'd away in Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Love! I ſigh, I die for him;
while he views me with Cold Indifference, or, at beſt, but Luke-warm
Friendſhip: Tyrant Cuſtom, and innate Modeſty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid my Tongue to utter
the Tortures of my Heart. He ſometimes laughs, and ſays, I am all Charms;
Oh! what wou'd I give to have him really think ſo! He behaves exactly alike
to my ſelf, and Siſters, and yet I can't help being jealous, if he ſpeaks
or looks at them. I am all Madneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair! I han't the Vanity to
think I can ever pleaſe a Man of his Senſe and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet I go on
to love! Sometimes <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0199100802:5"/> I think my conſtant Paſſion will be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and that he will like me for my good Nature, which ſome People
flatter me, and tell him, I have a great Share of: And as it is a Qualification
he very much admires, I ſtrive every Day, to improve it, and to command all
thoſe little Paſſions that are incident to our Sex. Was I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to
plead for my ſelf, I cou'd tell him, What an obedient Wife I'd make him! How
my Duty and Inclinations wou'd both concur, to pleaſe him in all Actions of
my Life! When he was abſent, I wou'd enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my ſelf with his dear Idea!
and when he return'd, meet him with inexpreſſible Raptures! I cou'd dwell
for ever on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting Subject: But fear I ſhould grow tireſome. This
opening of my Grief has been ſome Relief. I almoſt fear to have this
publiſhed: I wiſh, yet dread, he ſhould diſcover me. I don't know what
to do: Therefore rely wholly upon your Advice. If you print it, correct the bad

            <p>WHAT conſtant Companions are <hi>Merit</hi> and
<hi>Humility?</hi> How does this Lady conclude a Letter that muſt charm
<hi>every Reader. If you print it, correct the bad Engliſh.</hi> It is too
good to be corrected. Sincerity, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tenderneſs ſhine forth,
in every Sentence. That Perſon who does not plainly perceive, 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0199100802:6"/> that what <hi>Lucinda</hi> has written, flow'd from her
Heart, muſt have his own Heart ill pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and removed out of the Way of
<hi>Nature.</hi> If Men could write thus, no Woman of Senſe would be ever
courted in vain: When ſhe ſignifies ſo <hi>plainly</hi> that ſhe loves
him from her Heart; how cordially does ſhe labour to make that
<hi>Plainneſs</hi> ſtill <hi>plainer,</hi> if poſſible, as ſhe
proceeds ſtill <hi>farther</hi> in her Letter. Theſe plain Phraſes are
the Maſter-touches of <hi>Nature,</hi> and put <hi>Art</hi> out of
Countenance. This is the natural Simplicity, that makes the <hi>proud</hi>
Scholar's Ornaments look <hi>poor.</hi> Any body, that knows what Love is, will
not barely <hi>read,</hi> but <hi>feel</hi> this Lady's Letter. Old as I am, my
ſelf, how am I warm'd, when, ſhe expreſſes her Tenderneſs. And, if
every <hi>unconcerned</hi> Perſon be her <hi>Well-wiſher,</hi> what
<hi>Emotions</hi> muſt this Letter be able to raiſe in the Boſom of that
happy Man, whom it <hi>concerns.</hi> Will not her Prudence, her vow'd
Obedience, her Study to pleaſe, her Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and being unconſcious of the
greateſt Worth in her ſelf; her whole Pride placed in admiring him, her
Adoration, almoſt, of his ſuperior Merit; her deſiring, and yet
diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to deſerve him: Will not all theſe win over his Soul to her?
Where ſhe deſcribes to him, how ſhe will behave in his Preſence, and
how in his Abſence; what a Figure muſt ſhe make in the Imagination of
this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Man? Muſt ſhe not be as much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as ſhe admires? Does
ſhe not force him <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0199100802:7"/> to what ſhe ſo earneſtly
<hi>wiſhes?</hi> The God of Love lives, breathes and acts, in every Line of
it, and nothing leſs than THAT VERY MAN, who, as ſhe ſays, <hi>If there
be ſuch a thing as Perfection in Mankind, is certainly Maſter of it,</hi>
can be a <hi>ſuitable Prize,</hi> for her <hi>Merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT has been reported concerning the <hi>fineſt Orator,</hi> of
the preſent Age, that the Lady, to whom he was married, grew his
<hi>Wife,</hi> by being his <hi>Client.</hi> He had long been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with
her Patience, Temper and Spirit, by her Manner of ſoliciting her own Cauſe:
He knew her Fortune, which depended upon it; ſhe gave him ſuch full and
elegant Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as few profeſs'd Lawyers could have Penn'd, and as
ſcarce needed his own power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſſiſtance and Amendment. He ask'd her,
who had drawn them? and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her ſelf had been the Compiler, it is
no wonder, that ſo much Wit, in ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Perſon, made that
greateſt of Orators, whoſe Addreſſes no Lady could withſtand, from
that Moment, her Suiter, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, her Husband.—</p>
            <p>I HAVE often wiſh'd, to be fully ſatisfied of the Truth of
this little beautiful Piece of Secret Hiſtory.—But whether it be true
in all its Circumſtances, it was not invented by one, who meant to malign the
Fame of that Lord, or the Merit of his Lady, ſince a more glorious Accident
could not well be aſſigned, to have brought about the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of ſo
illuſtrious a Pair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0199100802:8"/>THE Letter, which now lies before me, is the
moſt exquiſite Plea that ever my Eyes beheld. I know ſome who
underſtand not what Love is, will be offended at a Woman's firſt declaring
her Paſſion. How ſenſible is the Fair One of this, when ſhe cries
out, <hi>Tyrant Cuſtom and innate Modeſty, forbid my Tongue to utter the
Tortures of my Heart.</hi>—By <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Leave, ſhe
<hi>herſelf,</hi> is too rigid and ſevere <hi>againſt herſelf.</hi>
Cuſtom, indeed, does forbid it, and a Tyrannical Cuſtom it is, becauſe,
though pretendedly grounded upon the Colours of Modeſty, 'tis unjuſt, 'tis
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and irreligious at the Bottom.—Is it not <hi>modeſt,</hi>
as well as <hi>natural,</hi> to have an Inclination to be honourably married?
She that has <hi>not</hi> an Inclination, <hi>before</hi> ſhe is ask'd, can
hardly, with Truth, declare <hi>Inclination</hi>: And if it was an Inclination
vertuous and honourable from the Beginning; it muſt have been equally
vertuous and honourable from the Beginning to have owned it. A dull and
obſtinate Concealment of the Truth, 'till it <hi>happens</hi> to be
<hi>extorted,</hi> is a <hi>Triumph</hi> given to <hi>Folly</hi> over
<hi>Nature,</hi> for the Sake of a <hi>miſtaken Modeſty.</hi> Both Sexes,
if they will but reflect, muſt <hi>agree</hi> in this
<hi>Truth.</hi>—</p>
            <p>WHAT Batchelor of good Senſe would not be overjoy'd to
diſcover a <hi>Lucinda,</hi> thus opening in his own Favour? The Man who
diſliked a Woman for declaring her Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, would be like one,
who ſeck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Silver Mine, and diſcovering by <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0199100802:9"/>
chance, a Golden one, ſhou'd deſert it, for no other Reaſon, but
becauſe good Fortune had put it in his Way.—</p>
            <p>THERE is a vaſt deal of Delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the Beauties
of a Woman's Mind, who could write thus delicately. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py would ſhe make
her Husband? She would ſooth any Sorrow that could <hi>reach</hi> him, and
<hi>exalt</hi> his <hi>Pleaſures</hi> into <hi>Raptures</hi>; ſhe would be
his <hi>Comfort</hi> in <hi>Adverſity,</hi> and <hi>gild</hi> and

            <p>BUT I draw towards a Concluſion as faſt as I can, for fear of

this Minute, with my Paper, in the Parlour of that fine Old Seat in <hi>Surrey.
Lucinda</hi> and her Lover, have both hold of the <hi>Plain Dealer,</hi> who
tells them his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like the Father of them both.—I hear him
reading, I ſee her wiſhing, and yet dreading to be diſcovered.—I
wiſh the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery my ſelf—Methinks I ſee it, and hear 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0199100802:10"/> him ſay—<hi>You are</hi> Lucinda; <hi>I have often
told you, You are all Charms. There wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but your Conſent to make
us the happy Couple here deſcribed—Lucinda,</hi> trembling, holds the
Paper as ſhe would let it drop—Now, if I could make my Paper ſpeak,
it ſhould ſay, <hi>Do, drop me from between you; join Hands over a more
Sacred Writing—It is ſo promiſing a Match, that the</hi> Plain Dealer
<hi>is to act the</hi> Father <hi>in it—If you have not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Opportunities—If you apprehend any Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance—Stay not a Moment
where you are—Take a Tour to</hi> Blunt-Hall <hi>together—The</hi>
Clergyman <hi>of our</hi> Aſſembly, <hi>ſhall join your Hands, and
bleſs your Wiſhes, and you may keep your Wedding at the</hi> ancient Seat
<hi>of the</hi> Blunt<hi>'s, ſince it will be ſo happy an Example to many

            <p>IT is the Duty of a Patriot to mourn for thoſe growing Evils,
which ſeem to threaten, either the Safety, or the Honour of his Country: And,
for this Reaſon, I have often been, irreſiſtably chagrin'd, at the
Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Publick <hi>Theatres.</hi>—But I was, lately,
enliven'd into <hi>Hope,</hi> upon this Subject; and am glad, I can aſſure
my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that there is a Spirit of Improvement at Work, to ſuſtain our
ſinking Taſte, and ſet Examples for our preſent Stages.</p>
            <p>THERE is a generous Boldneſs, as well in the <hi>Deſign</hi>
itſelf, as in the <hi>Time</hi> of putting it in Execution. But nothing is
more certain, than that it is form'd upon a Plan, which if it meets with the
propos'd Encouragement, will go a great Way toward keeping the Hearts of the
Gay World from breaking, ſhould ſo dreadful a Misfortune happen, as that
the God of Wit revenges himſelf upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0199100802:12"/>
Theatres in Faſhion, by making Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſham'd of <hi>appearing,</hi> where
they ought to bluſh at their Entertainment.</p>
            <p>I AM tranſported to this Pitch of Joy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having Landed at
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Stairs, in my Way from <hi>Barbican,</hi> to the
<hi>Abbey Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> (where I often muſe, on Subjects which, a long
Time hence, may fill <hi>Plain Dealers)</hi> and met, in the King's Highway, a
Party-colour'd younger Brother, of the juſtly-cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Mr.
<hi>Lun.</hi>—He was uſher'd along in great State, with a ſounding
Drum in his <hi>Front,</hi> and a Trumpet, and <hi>French</hi> Horn, plac'd
like Wings, on either <hi>Flank</hi>; while the <hi>Rear</hi> was brought up by
a Body of ſcatter'd <hi>Velites,</hi> the flying Fragments of Humanity!</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Checquer'd Nuntio,</hi> as I paſs'd him, ſtopt; and
nodded his looſe Head at me: Snatching off his Pigmy Hat, by the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit's
Tail which was annex'd to it: And, tripping toward me, with a wanton
<hi>Wavineſs,</hi> like the Curling of a Ship's long Pendant, when it dances
in a Breeze, ſlipt a <hi>Billet</hi> into my Hand; and, retreating, with a
merry Shrugg, or two, reſum'd his Poſt as before, and gave Continuance to
the Proceſſion.</p>
            <p>FROM the ludicrous Turn of his Figure, I open'd the Paper he gave
me, with very humble Expectation: But was ſtruck with no ſmall Reverence,
when I beheld the <hi>Royal Arms,</hi> magiſterially diſplay'd at the Head
of it: And Theſe ſurprizing Particulars pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulg'd, under the Stamp of

            <p>I FOUND myſelf not a little delighted, upon peruſing this
<hi>Notification,</hi> to be aſſur'd, in ſo Authentick a Manner, that we
have <hi>His Majeſty's Permiſſion,</hi> to be <hi>better
accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated</hi> than we have been. For, from this, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional,</hi>
Royal Grace, I grew ſanguine enough to expect, a very ſudden Revocation of
certain Grants, for Monopolizing the <hi>Art of Conjuring</hi>; and of
bewitching the King's Liege People out of all ſober Uſe, as well of their
<hi>Money</hi> as their <hi>Senſes.</hi>—I enter'd, therefore, with
Pleaſure, on the Diviſions of my printed Billet: And began, with a
Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Eye, to examine what Likelihood there was, that <hi>Hero</hi> and
<hi>Leander,</hi> ſhould be too hard for the <hi>Devil,</hi> and his
<hi>Double Favourites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Live Punch,</hi> though they ſeem to build much upon
him, I cou'd conſider as no great Rarity.—Not that I wou'd derogate, in
the leaſt, from that Reſpect, which is due to his Character: But he has
<hi>Brothers</hi> upon both Stages, as much <hi>alive</hi> as himſelf, with
the Advantage of being more incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0199100802:15"/>—<hi>Punch</hi> will be <hi>underſtood,</hi> with ſo little
Difficulty, that our People of <hi>Polite Taſte,</hi> will never be able to
<hi>bear</hi> him.—But, when I had read about half a Line lower, and came
to that Part of the Declaration, which promiſes, <hi>That the Actors of
this</hi> new Company, <hi>ſhall be</hi> ARTIFICIAL, I was preſently at
Eaſe again: For, in that Caſe, I ſaw, moſt certainly, that there muſt
be No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty in their Deſign; ſince nothing is more generally allow'd, with
Regard to the <hi>other</hi> Companies, than, That, for <hi>One</hi> of their
Actors, who is <hi>Artificial,</hi> Six are abſolutely <hi>Naturals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I GATHER'D much Conſolation too, from that other welcome
Aſſurance, That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of <hi>this</hi> Royal Company, are to be
very <hi>Changeable,</hi> and <hi>Conſiſtivarious.</hi> The Town has,
Annually, for ſome Years paſt, been <hi>dieted,</hi> by the <hi>Playhouſe
Doctors:</hi> And gone through a <hi>Regular Courſe of Bitters,</hi> with a
moſt laudable Spirit of <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and true Chriſtian
<hi>Reſignation</hi>—Their <hi>Wit</hi> was fall'n <hi>Sick,</hi> and
ſubmitted to <hi>Quack Potions:</hi> Becauſe Mountebank Stages, by being
<hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd,</hi> had the Reputation of <hi>College Practice:</hi> (And, to
poiſon by <hi>Authority,</hi> has the good Fortune to be <hi>no
Felony</hi>).—So that nothing is more certain, than that the
<hi>Wooden</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, will have the Advantage of our <hi>Brazen</hi> Ones,
in this important Point, <hi>the Changeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, as for the <hi>Conſiſtivarious,</hi> the old Workmen, I
am afraid, will be more than a <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0199100802:16"/> Match for the new
Ones.—I am not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſo able a Critick, in the Language of theſe
Wooden Orators, as to decide, with any abſolute Sufficiency, the
Signification of a Word, ſo Derivative and Complex, as
<hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivarious:</hi> But, if I am fortunate enough, to have rightly
broke in upon ſo impregnable a <hi>Decompoſite,</hi> then, I am ſure, I
may ſafely affirm, That our Stage's Conduct, ever ſince I can remember it,
has been <hi>truly Conſiſtiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> in the moſt remarkable and
ſurprizing Manner.—Nay, a <hi>Triumvir</hi> of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
Adminiſtration, the accompliſhed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> which we
are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Honour of <hi>admiring,</hi> in the Front of this
happy Seaſon, is, I am ſure, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd for his
<hi>Conſiſtivariouſneſs,</hi> that one wou'd almoſt be induc'd to
ſwear, That the very <hi>Word</hi> was of his <hi>own making,</hi> and
coin'd, on Purpoſe, for his <hi>New Tragedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, here let me correct a falſe Report, which this Great Writer
ſuffers under, by the Means of ſome, who envy him the Honours which are due
to his <hi>undoubting Genius:</hi>—It is ſaid, the Name of his New
Tragedy is to be <hi>Caeſar in Egypt.</hi> But I aſſure all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
People, that though <hi>Caeſar,</hi> may ſtand, in Capitals, on the
<hi>Title Page,</hi> yet that ſhou'd only be conſider'd as an <hi>Error of
the Preſs</hi>; which the Buyer may <hi>correct</hi> with Eaſe, by reading
CIBBER <hi>in Egypt,</hi> inſtead of CAESAR: And, with that ſmall
Alteration, every Thing in this Tragedy, will be found <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0199100802:17"/>
extremely Natural; and ſtand directly, as it <hi>ſhou'd</hi> be.</p>
            <p>THE Spirit, however of our new Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, at the
<hi>White-Hart,</hi> is inflam'd into an enterprizing and ſmart
<hi>Emulation!</hi> And I was very much taken with the Turn of this brisk
Defiance—That, tho' they may paſs for <hi>Nobodies,</hi> becauſe they
are made of <hi>Wood</hi>; yet, ſince they have the Good Luck to be <hi>five
Foot high,</hi> they ſee no Reaſon to ſuppoſe their Adverſaries to be
<hi>more than their Match</hi>; and will, therefore, <hi>perform with ſuch
Nicety, as not to be diſtinguiſh'd from them</hi>; and doubt not in the
leaſt, to give an <hi>equal Satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS for the next Paragraph, I fear it was purpoſely embroider'd
over, with thoſe <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſes,</hi> and <hi>Alſo's,</hi> for no other
Reaſon in the World, but to cover a conſcious Deficiency in the
<hi>Senſe,</hi> by the Eloquent Glare of the
<hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</hi>—For, who does not obſerve, That <hi>Dancing
of Jigs, Maſquerades, and Sarabands,</hi> are Improvements in Learning, which
the happy Genius of our <hi>Nobility,</hi> and the vaſt Encouragement they
give to <hi>Wit,</hi> have brought, already, to their full Perfection?—I
can't ſee, therefore, what Novelty can be expected, in this Particular:
Unleſs, when they give Notice, That <hi>All their Performers are to be Wooden
ones,</hi> they wou'd have us underſtand it, that, by Aid of ſome <hi>third
Fauſtus,</hi> their <hi>Fiddles</hi> are to fall a <hi>Dancing,</hi> and keep
Time to their own Muſick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0199100802:18"/>THE Riſing and Setting of the <hi>Sun,</hi>
I have very little to ſay for, with Regard to its
<hi>Newneſs.—Cupid</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe</hi> may pleaſe at firſt,
but will flatten, if they ſhew it often.—The <hi>Court of Foreign
Kings</hi> is no ſuch <hi>Rarity</hi> as they think it.—But, for every
Figure to be <hi>dreſs'd,</hi> according to their <hi>own Country
Faſhion.</hi>—That, indeed, is a Stroke of <hi>Decorum,</hi> which
out-ſoars, at one Flight, <hi>Patent, Licenſe,</hi> and <hi>Charter!</hi>
And it will be reaſonable to hope, after the Publick Taſte has been ſo
refin'd, by theſe <hi>Chips of a new Block,</hi> that we ſhall ſee no
more Intermixture of the Ancient, with the Modern Dreſſes: Where the Order
of Things is ſo capriciouſly revers'd, that the Courtiers of an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarch ſhall ſtand round him, like <hi>Beaux of
Yeſterday;</hi> and the Sovereign himſelf ſtrut about, in Trunk Breeches,
and be dreſs'd, as <hi>old</hi> as a <hi>Patriarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is, in the next Article, an odd kind of Myſtery, which I
own I could not fathom: And, I frankly confeſs, I was, once, afraid, there
might be a <hi>Plot</hi> in it.—I puzzled my Imagination, till I was
weary of imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—But, the more I mus'd upon it, the <hi>leſs</hi> I
was able to <hi>make,</hi> of that ſtrange <hi>High-German Artiſt, who was
to ſhake an empty Bag, inſide out, that we might ſee, there was nothing
in it: And, then, rain Gold and Eggs out of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was eaſily to be diſcern'd, that the <hi>Scene</hi> was
<hi>ſhifted</hi> in this Place.—The <hi>Play-houſes</hi> 
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0199100802:19"/> could have nothing to do with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph: None of
<hi>Their</hi> Bags, for ſome Years paſt, having been <hi>Empty</hi> enough
to turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide outward. So that I was greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd, by the
Knottineſs of this Difficulty: Till I, luckily, bethought myſelf of a
Friend of mine, a <hi>Decypherer</hi>; whoſe ſurprizing Dexterity, levell'd
every Rub in his Way, and made it as plain, as a Demonſtration, That the
empty Bag was the <hi>South-Sea Scheme.</hi>—That the Golden Showers were
the <hi>ſudden Sallies of that Stock:</hi> And, that the <hi>Eggs</hi> were
the <hi>ſucking Bubbles,</hi> that were <hi>hatch'd</hi> under the Warmth of
it.</p>
            <p>I SHOULD have been <hi>loſt,</hi> in this <hi>Deſart,</hi> if
I had not return'd, to make a Remark, concerning the <hi>Modeſty</hi> of our
new Comedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.—How praiſe-worthy is their Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and the
Diſintereſtedneſs of their Spirit! Who, after putting themſelves to the
two-fold Charge of <hi>building,</hi> both their <hi>Stage,</hi> and their
<hi>Performers,</hi> propoſe to act, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, at <hi>Lower
Rates,</hi> than their Rivals; which Laſt go on to <hi>demoliſh,</hi> as
faſt as their Competitors can <hi>build up:</hi> And yet, have the Courage to
<hi>raiſe</hi> their Prices, becauſe they <hi>fall</hi> their
Entertainments.</p>
            <p>THEN, how juſt, and how <hi>Sympathetical,</hi> is another Care
of our Wooden Reformers!—Being perfectly acquainted with the Talents of a
Modiſh Audience, they have judiciouſly determined to provide Room for the
<hi>Coaches</hi> and <hi>Chairs,</hi> in the ſame Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0199100802:20"/> with the <hi>Gentlemen.</hi>—Their Thoughts were
more upon <hi>Merit,</hi> than upon <hi>Good Breeding</hi>;—And ſince
they knew that their <hi>Kindred Vehicles</hi> were as <hi>able Judges,</hi> as
their <hi>Owners,</hi> and (which is of more Conſequence) as
<hi>well-dreſs'd</hi> too; they, therefore, thought it but reaſonable to
treat 'em with equal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</p>
            <p>WHAT kind of <hi>Play,</hi> that may be, which any
<hi>Gentleman</hi> and <hi>Lady,</hi> who give Notice before-hand, are to be
diverted with <hi>in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi> I muſt make a Perſonal Search into,
before I undertake to conſider it.—But, upon the Whole, I believe,
there can be no manner of Doubt, but that <hi>The White-Hart, in St.
Margaret</hi>'s-<hi>Lane,</hi> may bid as fair for <hi>Fine Audiences,</hi> as
any of the Reſt of our Theatres; where, though the Actors are not <hi>of
Wood,</hi> they have uſurp'd the Province of <hi>Wooden Actors.</hi>

<hi>graſp</hi> Ideas, that are <hi>thin,</hi> and <hi>fleeting,</hi> I lament
that the <hi>Materials</hi> of the <hi>Painter</hi>'s <hi>noble Art,</hi> are
not as <hi>laſting</hi> as the <hi>Painter</hi>'s Fame is. For, in that
caſe, Two <hi>Siſter Arts,</hi> uniting their different Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the one
tranſmitting <hi>Souls,</hi> the other <hi>Bodies,</hi> (or the outward Form
of Bodies) their combining Influence would be of Force to fruſtrate <hi>Death
itſelf:</hi> And all the Ages of the World would ſeem to be
<hi>Cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, here, the <hi>Poet</hi> triumphs. His Works <hi>outlive</hi>
the <hi>Painter</hi>'s, though the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0199100802:22"/> begins much
ſooner to be famous, than the Poet does: And has alſo commonly the
Advantage over him, with Relation to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:</hi> The ſtrongeſt
Reaſons of which Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I have lately read, with Pleaſure, in the
following Letter, from an excellent, and learned, Critick, whom I ſpoke of,
in a late Paper, and whoſe <hi>Encouragement,</hi> I am afraid, is (to the
future Reproach of our Age) moſt ſhamefully diſproportioned to his
<hi>Merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is ſomething extremely <hi>new,</hi> in the Subject, as
well as the Sentiments, of this Letter: And I will, therefore, take the

when he writ it, meant it only for the private Satisfaction of a Gentleman of
his Acquaintance.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p> I KNOW not whether I ſhould return you Thanks for your laſt
Viſit or not, becauſe I know not whether I am indebted to Fortune, or to
You for it. But I am obliged to take Notice, in a particular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of the
Deſire you expreſs'd, during our being together, that I would have my
<hi>Picture drawn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> AFTER I have omitted it ſo many Years, I would not have it
drawn at laſt by a <hi>Bungler,</hi> and I am not in a Condition at
preſent, to ſatisfy one who is a Maſter; nor do I know whether we have
any Maſter, <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0199100802:23"/> who would make me a <hi>Preſent</hi> of
it: Though a Painter is much more able to <hi>give,</hi> than a Poet to
<hi>buy</hi>; which has put me upon conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what are the Reaſons
which make the <hi>Painter</hi> ſo ſucceſsful, and the <hi>Poet</hi> ſo
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate; that make the Art of Poetry, and the Art of Painting, which are
Siſters, ſo very <hi>Reſembling,</hi> by <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo very
<hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> by <hi>Fortune.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> A great <hi>Poet,</hi> for the moſt Part, neglects and
affronts <hi>Fortune,</hi> by making his Court to <hi>Fame</hi>; but Fame and
<hi>Fortune</hi> are <hi>Rivals,</hi> that contend with each other, which
ſhall heap moſt Favours upon the deſerving <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> All the
great Painters that have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared among us, have had Juſtice done to their
Merit while they <hi>liv'd,</hi> and no <hi>Sign-poſt-Painter</hi> has ever
yet paſs'd for a <hi>great Maſter.</hi> All the Painters, whom our Kings
have delighted to employ, have been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as <hi>Holbin, Rubens, Vandyck,
Leeley, Ryley, Kneller,</hi> and <hi>Thornhill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> BUT the contrary of this has happened with Regard to
<hi>Poets.</hi> Several good ones, nay, ſeveral of the <hi>beſt,</hi> have
been neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during their <hi>Life-time,</hi> as <hi>Spencer, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Butler, Otway,</hi> among ourſelves, and among the Ancients, <hi>Homer</hi>;
while the moſt contemptible of all Scriblers have been Eſteemed and
Honoured. Our Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have, more than once, had ſuch vile
Scriblers for <hi>their Poets,</hi> and have, like For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, taken a Pleaſure
in <hi>exalting Fools.</hi> 
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0199100802:24"/> But tho' a King can give a Man
Title and Place, only GOD can give him <hi>Genius.</hi> 'Tis the Prerogative of
a King to make a <hi>Knight,</hi> but only GOD can make a <hi>Poet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> THE Reaſons of the Difference which we ſometimes find, in
the Fortunes of great <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Painters,</hi> appear to me to be
chiefly theſe which follow:</p>
                  <p> The Firſt is, That the great Painter, for each of his
Maſter-pieces, has but <hi>one</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and no <hi>Copy</hi> can come
up to the eaſie Grace and the natural Force of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Original</hi>; whereas, of maſterly Poems, there are as many Originals,
as there are true Copies; and all of them have equal Force, and equal Grace and
Beauty; and this is none of the leaſt Things that render the Works of the
Painter ſo precious, and the Artiſt himſelf ſo fortunate. A Man may buy
the Works of <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi> for a very Trifle, whereas
thoſe of <hi>Raphael</hi> are above any Value. But this multiplying of
Originals gives the great <hi>Poet,</hi> at leaſt, one Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over the
famous <hi>Painter,</hi> which is, that it renders what he writes perpetual.
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are immortal in their <hi>Works,</hi> but
<hi>Zeuxis</hi> and <hi>Apelles</hi> are only ſo in their <hi>Fame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> ANOTHER Reaſon of this Difference, is, The Univerſality of
the Language in which the Painter delivers his Art: The great Painter ſpeaks
to all Countries as intelligibly, as to his own, nay, more intelligibly, more
gracefully, and more forcibly, to thoſe <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0199100802:25"/> Countries which
are polite; and, therefore, his Fame keeps equal Pace with his Merit; and
where-ever he goes, both Fortune and Fame attend him. The more his Pieces are
known, the more they are deſired, and the more dearly purchaſed. The
greateſt of Kings are ambitious to be Maſters of them, and ambitious to
poſſeſs the <hi>Painters,</hi> as well as their Works. What modern Poet,
during his <hi>Life-time,</hi> was ever <hi>read</hi> by ſo many Sovereign
Princes, as were <hi>drawn</hi> by the Hand of <hi>Titian?</hi> What Prince
ever heap'd thoſe Honours on a Poet, that <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth</hi>
did on <hi>Titian?</hi> Did the renowned <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf, with
all his Capacity, and all his Greatneſs of Mind, ſo Honour <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
or <hi>Virgil?</hi> Now, while the Painter's Fame and Fortune are unconfin'd,
thoſe of the greateſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets are reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
the Iſlands of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that is, to
leſs than <hi>Twenty Millions of People,</hi> of which, perhaps, there are
hardly <hi>Five hundred</hi> which have a fine Taſte of Poetry.</p>
                  <p> ANOTHER Reaſon of the Difference in the Fortunes of great
Painters and Poets, with regard to Painting after the <hi>Life,</hi> is the
darling <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and the darling <hi>Paſſion</hi> of both
Sexes, and eſpecially of the Women; no Motive is generally ſo predominant,
as that of Self-Intereſt, no Paſſion ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſo ardent as
Self-Love. Now the Generality of both Sexes look upon their <hi>Perſons,</hi>
as their <hi>very ſelves.</hi> It is their <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0199100802:26"/> Perſons,
then, which they ardently deſire ſhould be advantageouſly known, and
fairly diſtinguiſhed, and ſhould remain after them. This the great
<hi>Painter</hi> alone can perform, who is ſure to draw the beſt
Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet, at the ſame Time, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a Face, from all
other Faces what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which 'tis impoſſible that the greateſt
<hi>Poet</hi> in the World, can ever do, by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> ANOTHER Reaſon of the foreſaid Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, is, That few
Perſons pretend to decide ſovereignly in <hi>Painting,</hi> but they who
are acquainted with the Rules of the Art, and who, beſides the Reading
Ancient and Modern Hiſtory, underſtand <hi>Geometry, Perſpective,</hi>
and <hi>Anatomy</hi>; whereas the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Mankind pretending to judge of
<hi>Poetry,</hi> ſovereignly, and without Appeal, wretched
<hi>Poetaſters</hi> have been often <hi>applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> and <hi>excellent
Poets neglected,</hi> becauſe the former write moſt to the
<hi>Capacity</hi> of the <hi>Rabble.</hi> And there is one Thing, which I have
formerly mentioned, and which I have often obſerved, and always with freſh
Surprize, That the Rabble, by their Noiſe, their Clamours, and their
Obſtinacy, have often drawn in Men who have paſs'd for Men of Senſe, to
affirm their unrighteous Decrees; whereas the Men of Senſe, with all their
Judgment, and with all their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, have never been able to draw in
the Rabble, without the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0199100802:27"/> THERE is ſtill another Reaſon of the
foreſaid Difference in the Fortunes of great Poets and Painters, which is
this; Moſt Men are very ſenſual; and Pleaſure of <hi>Senſe</hi>
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects them, more than Pleaſure merely <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual.</hi> They love to
have their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings informed by their Senſes, becauſe that
Inſtruction gives them <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Mixture of Pain,
which always, in ſome meaſure, accompanies Labour and great Attention. And
of all the Senſes, they love chiefly to be inſtructed by the
<hi>Sight,</hi> becauſe the Inſtruction that comes that Way, is attended
with the leaſt <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> And if it be true, that there are no
<hi>innate Ideas</hi>; if it be true, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the
Underſtanding, but what was in the <hi>external Senſe before,</hi> then the
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Inſtruction uſed by the <hi>Painter,</hi> is the very Method
wich <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> have taken to inſtruct us. And this is
the Cauſe of that extraordinary Pleaſure which Men receive from
<hi>Painting,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Fourth
Chapter of his Art of <hi>Poetry.</hi> And, in this, the <hi>Painter</hi> has
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely the Advantage of the <hi>Poet.</hi> The Painter informs the
Underſtanding, and warms the Imagination, by ſtriking the <hi>Sight</hi>
ſtrongly, and giving it the Height of Pleaſure; while all that can be done,
of that kind, by the greateſt Poet that ever liv'd, is to make us vainly
<hi>imagine,</hi> that he ſets Things before our <hi>Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0199100802:28"/> THUS have I laid before you ſome of the
chief Reaſons of the Difference that is found in the Fortunes of
<hi>Great</hi> Poets and Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and, now, to end with the Buſineſs with
which I began, If he whom you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to draw my Picture, is not a
<hi>Maſter,</hi> I ſhall be unwilling to give him any Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If he is a
<hi>Maſter,</hi> he is <hi>Rich,</hi> as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly as I am <hi>not
ſo:</hi> I therefore expect, That he ſhall do it <hi>intirely gratis</hi>;
For as <hi>Painter,</hi> and <hi>Poet,</hi> we are <hi>Siſters Children,</hi>
and he is worſe than a <hi>Jew,</hi> who, being <hi>Rich himſelf, will take
Money of a Poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>

                           <hi>SATURN,</hi> the Son of COELUM, after having made a
Separation of Body and Goods with his Wife CYBELE, married NECESSITY the
Daughter of DESTINY and FORTUNE.</p>
                        <p>Old Father DESTINY gave this poor Girl of his, her
Education among the <hi>MUSES,</hi> and trained her up in the Company of
<hi>Poets</hi> 
                           <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0199100802:30"/> and <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> She was
bleſſed, from a very Child, with a ſtrong, and enterprizing Genius, quick
and ready at Invention, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of mighty Projects, and ever intent upon
proper Ways and Means, to give a finiſhing Stroke to her Undertakings. But
though ſhe was ingenious, ſhe was homely in her Perſon; ſhe, poor
Thing! had none of thoſe Charms to boaſt of, which might draw the Eyes of
Lovers upon her; her <hi>Mien</hi> carried with it as little Temptation as her
<hi>Face</hi>; and her Fortune was <hi>low,</hi> and ſtill <hi>leſs
inviting</hi> than <hi>either</hi>; ſo that ſhe was no Body's Taſte, and
not any Individual breatheing had the leaſt Thought of her for a
<hi>Wife.</hi> The <hi>MUSES</hi> found the Charge grow heavy upon Them, and,
ſenſible of their Inability to go through with the Expence of keeping her
much longer, the begg'd DESTINY, by all means, to take her out of their Hands,
and think of making proper Proviſion for her in ſome other Way. This put
DESTINY on trying to bring about a Match, between his Daughter, and his old
Friend SATURN, whom he perſuaded, that ſince he was ſo far gone in Years,
and parted from his Wife, without any Appearance of their coming together
again; it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to do better, than marry ſome
honeſt careful Body, who would be tender in looking after him: And then he
took Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to name his own Daughter, as a Perſon well qualified for
that Office; aſſuring the old Gentleman, at the ſame Time, of her
Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0199100802:31"/> to do every Thing, that would be moſt
pleaſing in his Eyes.</p>
                        <p>THE Truth is, NECESSITY was a good toward Girl, and
followed her Father's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ſo well, and behaved herſelf with ſo
much Docility, Humility, and Diligence, that ſhe intirely won the old Man's
Heart. That which prevailed with him, moſt of all, to come to this
Reſolution, aroſe from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, That all the Uneaſineſs
between him and CYBELE, was occaſioned by her <hi>too great</hi> Riches,
which made her preſumptuous enough to ſlight and deſpiſe him, and uſe
him ſo ill, as to carry on a ſecret Affair with PLUTO, a Commerce, the
moſt diſpleaſing in Nature to him, and which he could never forgive.
Hence he became perſwaded, it would be doing very wiſely, to marry a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Birth, who having nothing of her own, would think of no other Enjoyments,
but thoſe which ſhe ſhared in common with him, which he knew to be
ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her eternally happy.</p>
                        <p>PRELIMINARIES were all ſettled, the Treaty concluded,
and the Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated, between old SATURN, and his poor Spouſe
NECESSITY, whoſe whole Portion conſiſted in her <hi>Vigilance,</hi> her
<hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE only <hi>Iſſue</hi> of this Marriage was VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUE,
who from her Cradle, gave Promiſes of her Beauty. As ſoon as ſhe grew up,
the mature Virgin drew gazing Crowds after her, <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0199100802:32"/> and the
Eyes of the admiring World was fix'd upon this Object. There was not that
ſingle God in <hi>Olympus,</hi> but was fond of her Acquaintance: However, as
ſhe happened to be of a high and over-ruling Temper, and would take the
Liberty of telling People their Faults very plainly to their Faces; ſhe was
not over-welcome to many, where ſhe went.</p>
                        <p>THEN, again, her Mother NECESSITY, whoſe Company ſhe
was ſeldom out of, was, by Nature, baſhful, and little uſed to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
the Palaces of the <hi>Great.</hi> She went always very <hi>plainly</hi> and
<hi>ſimply</hi> cloathed, after the <hi>old Faſhion,</hi> which made her
not a little timorous of viſiting the <hi>modiſh</hi> Gods of
<hi>Quality.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS manner of Life becoming trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to them, they
went often to pay their Reſpects to the <hi>MUSES,</hi> and to ſee the
<hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> their old Friends, with whom they
always found a more friendly and grateful Reception. This made them think of
returning to the <hi>MUSES,</hi> and there to live for ever: And this NECESSITY
got her Husband to conſent to, who approved of this Retreat the more
willingly, becauſe he very juſtly judged, that the good Qualities of his
Daughter VIRTUE, might help a great deal, in that Place, towards correcting the
Vices and reforming the Errors of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                        <p>ACCORDINGLY they returned to <hi>Parnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and
the <hi>MUSES</hi> obliged them with <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0199100802:33"/> fine Apartments,
where VIRTUE made herſelf known more and more, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by every Eye
that could get a Sight of her. The <hi>MUSES</hi> did all they could, to exalt
the Merit of their new Tenant; they left nothing unſaid, that might inlarge
her Reputation; they had a mighty Mind to captivate ſome ſuitable Perſon,
and engage his Affections to her: But all in vain; there was not one Ear
<hi>rightly</hi> open to theſe repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Praiſes and Admonitions. Whole
Crowds indeed would throng, to gaze at her, every Spectator Admired her, and
even every Hearer, when ſhe ſpoke, was forc'd to allow, That ſhe had
Reaſon for the Reprimands ſhe made; but not one of them would have any
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with her, or join themſelves for ever with a Perſon, whoſe
Manner of Living was ſo extraordinary and uncommon.</p>
                        <p>THUS ſhe remained a long Time unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, 'till a
venerable Sort of Gentleman, oldiſh, but not very far in Years, who had the
Reputation of great Capacity, Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Experience, and whoſe Name
was WISDOM, happen'd to light upon her. To him this <hi>tart</hi> Humour of
hers, which was always as <hi>juſt</hi> as it was <hi>ſevere,</hi> was not
at all diſtaſteful: On the contrary, he liked her for it; he made his Court
to her, and having addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her Father and Mother for their Conſent,
and obtained it, married her, to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Joy of
<hi>Parnaſſus.</hi>

                        <p>ONE Day, above the reſt, having cloſely employed
himſelf upon an Undertaking of great Moment, a Task which his Mother VIRTUE
had been pleaſed to ſet him; he ſaw RECOMPENCE, the Daughter of MERIT and
of REASON, and became paſſionately in Love with her. Her <hi>Youth</hi> was
blooming, her <hi>Beauty</hi> exquiſitely charming; her Humour powerfully
bewitching; her <hi>whole Perſon</hi> irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtably raviſhing: All
ſhe <hi>look'd,</hi> or <hi>ſaid,</hi> or <hi>did,</hi> was ſo engaging,
that it was <hi>natural</hi> in her to <hi>pleaſe,</hi> and there was no-body
but loved her, no-body but longed to poſſeſs her.</p>
                        <p>LABOUR, who was nearly touched with ſo many agreeable
Qualities, reſolved with himſelf to do every thing that ſhould be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to gain her; and, as ſhe did not want Lovers, he judged he
ſhould meet with many Difficulties before he could attain his deſired End:
But having received ſome joyful Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that the Figure he made in
the World, did not diſpleaſe her, he reſolved to omit nothing, that might
make him ſtill more grateful in the Eye of his Miſtreſs. After infinite
Pains, innumerable Hopes and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, the Treaty was at length
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0199100802:35"/> with MERIT and REASON, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of
RECOMPENCE, who gave their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with great Alacrity; and the more, for
that VIRTUE herſelf did very heartily inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt herſelf in that Affair.
Nay, farthermore, Advices came to the Parents of RECOMPENCE, that the Marriage
was APPROVED and DESIRED by COELUM, the Great-Grandfather to LABOUR.</p>
                        <p>IN Effect, LABOUR and RECOMPENCE were ſo exactly
matched, that one may ſay, they were born <hi>one</hi> for the
<hi>other</hi>; their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was perfectly happy, by the good
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in which they lived; For LABOUR continuing towards his Wife
the ſame Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, deſired to be everlaſtingly in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; he
could not bear her a Moment out of his Sight, by his good Will; and would
ſcarce be perſuaded, at Times, that he had ſeen her, when he really had.
His Wife was no leſs fond, on her Side; ſhe obſerved a Conduct ſo
regular, and ſo judicious, that ſhe never gave him Reaſon of Complaint,
and would favour no-body with her <hi>Preſence,</hi> where her Husband was
<hi>abſent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS Marriage was render'd ſtill more proſperous by
its Fruitfulneſs. For, they had Iſſue Three Children, Two Girls, and a
Boy. The Boy, who was the Youngeſt, was called REST: He was <hi>well
made</hi> in his <hi>Perſon, agreeable, inſinuating, welcome</hi>
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went: His noble Birth, and engaging Qualities, made him regarded
and coveted <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0199100802:36"/> by <hi>all</hi> the World, and chiefly by the
<hi>Rich.</hi> He was not of ſo high a Spirit as his Siſters: He viſited
none but Perſons that were peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and little enterprizing. His
<hi>Father</hi> was angry at it, and did all he could to render him <hi>more
active,</hi> but he fled out of his Sight, becauſe continual ſolliciting
him to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, diſturbed his <hi>Quiet,</hi> and interrupted his
Beloved <hi>Repoſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THESE repeated Sollicitations grew, at laſt, ſo
inſupportable to REST, that, his Humour being no longer able to bear that of
his <hi>Father,</hi> which was ſo <hi>oppoſite,</hi> he harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Malice
againſt him, and joining in an Aſſociation with IDLENESS, with whom he
had contracted a <hi>ſtrict Friendſhip,</hi> they plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together to take
away the Life of the Parent of REST. But honeſt Father LABOUR, being
vigilant, was not long without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering this Conſpiracy, of which being
but too certain, he drove this <hi>unnatural Son</hi> from him, nor would ever
ſee him more: REST, touch'd with <hi>Repentance,</hi> or puſhed by
<hi>ſome other</hi> Motive, retired to the <hi>Service of the Gods,</hi>
where he has, ever ſince, taken up his Reſidence.</p>
                        <p>THE Two Daughters of LABOUR, were GLORY and PLEASURE, both
of them fine Perſons, intirely like their Mother, ſo very like her, that
they were often taken for her, which made her extreamly fond of them. LABOUR
loved them dearly too, as well on Account of their Merit, as for that <hi>near
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance</hi> 
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0199100802:37"/> of Features which made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
when his Heart was firſt ſmitten with Love.</p>
                        <p>THE Children, on their Side, dutifully anſwered this
Affection, and hardly ever quitted their <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi>
where-ever they went, whether to <hi>private People,</hi> or <hi>Princes,</hi>
where they <hi>moſt</hi> delighted to make their Abode, and where they were
<hi>very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi> being ſignificant Perſons in <hi>War</hi> and
<hi>Peace,</hi> and ſhining as well in the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> as the
<hi>Field.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is true, that PLEASURE, was not ſo lofty and proud of
Heart, as GLORY, her Siſter: For whereas GLORY thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
<hi>great</hi> Things, and would frequent none but People of great Genius,
deſpiſing all other Conſiderations; PLEASURE, on the contrary, could
amuſe herſelf with any thing, loving as well Buſineſs of <hi>little
Account,</hi> as that of <hi>Importance</hi>; the People of a <hi>midling,</hi>
as well as of the <hi>ſublimeſt</hi> Genius; <hi>low,</hi> as well as
<hi>high</hi> Life, careſſing all alike; which won her the Hearts of all
the World: As ſhe was, by Nature, very <hi>curious,</hi> ſhe diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
herſelf with making little particular Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to People, who were glad to
have her in their Company, provided ſhe was not with her <hi>Father</hi> and
her <hi>Siſter,</hi> the <hi>Auſterity</hi> of whom, put them under too
great a Reſtraint.</p>
                        <p>THESE little Sallies gave a <hi>Stain</hi> to her
Reputation, it not being poſſible to ſee ſo fine a Girl familiarly
viſit ſo many People, <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0199100802:38"/> without ſpeaking of it. But
what had like to have ruined her intirely, was, that at the ſame Time a
<hi>debauch'd Girl,</hi> who had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Air</hi> of PLEASURE,
but much <hi>Affectation,</hi> took it in her Head to go by the <hi>ſame</hi>
Name, in order to find the <hi>eaſier Acceſs</hi> in all Places. She was
the Daughter of LEISURE and DEBAUCH, deſpicable People! and, as ſhe had
neither <hi>Birth</hi> nor <hi>Honour,</hi> ſhe mingled indifferently with
<hi>all Sorts</hi> of Perſons, leading an infamous Life, and ſo
diſorderly, that ſhe paſſed for one loſt.</p>
                        <p>THIS Identity of Names, made them attribute to the
<hi>true</hi> PLEASURE, all the Diſorders of the <hi>falſe,</hi> which
obliged her to clear up the Matter with her Father LABOUR, who was deceived,
like the reſt of the World, by this Appearance. But above all Things, her
<hi>conſcious Innocence,</hi> which they accuſed her to have violated, gave
her great Confidence in her own Juſtification. She made known to her
<hi>Father,</hi> that the greateſt Part of thoſe ſhe frequented, were the
beſt Friends of <hi>Him,</hi> and his Anceſtors, VIRTUE and WISDOM; That
ſhe was cheriſhed by a <hi>whole Sect</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers</hi>; and,
in ſhort, That ſhe ſaw <hi>none</hi> but People, whoſe <hi>Manners</hi>
were <hi>Praiſe-worthy.</hi>

                  <p>HAVING the Charge of two young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Fortune lately
devolved upon me; I cannot but think it needful to call in the
Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>PLAIN DEALER</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to perform
this important Task, with that Juſtice and Prudence, which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd it
requires.</p>
                  <p>I therefore beg you will give me ſome Rules for Education;
and, that they may the better Adapted to my preſent Neceſſity, I muſt
tell you, as conciſely as I can, the different Diſpoſitions I have to
deal with.</p>
                  <p>THE eldeſt is about Fifteen, very Bookiſh, but her chief
Study has hitherto been in Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Novels. I think it not proper to
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage this Taſte of Reading in her, but would rather lead her,
inſenſibly, into the Peruſal of Books really Uſeful; which to ſuch a
One, ought to be entertaining too. What they muſt be, I ſubmit to your
Judgment, who, I hope, will Recommend ſome Authors that may be ſafely put
into their Hands.</p>
                  <p>MY younger Charge, not quite Fourteen, is ſo far from reading
Romances, that I can fix her to nothing; She promiſes fair to be the very 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0199100802:41"/> Counter-part of your <hi>Patty Amble;</hi> And I believe
has been a <hi>Coquette</hi> from her Cradle; She is good-natur'd, but giddy,
and I fear it will be a difficult Matter to make her a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Woman,
tho' She certainly has good Senſe.</p>
                  <p>THIS will be no Paradox, when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many People

            <p>IT is Nobly and Generouſly obſerved by an Excellent Poet of

ſublimely, the moſt <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deeds of others.</hi> But methinks, on
the other hand, it gives an unſpeakable Pleaſure to deliver in
<hi>writing,</hi> what may give occaſion to <hi>good Actions.</hi> The
honeſt Inclination of <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> and her earneſt Deſire, That
I would give her a Word of Advice, concur to raiſe in me this Expectation,
and therefore, while I ſhall lay down ſome curſory Obſervations, which
may be of Service to young People, I am not aſham'd to own, That the little
Entertainment, which I offer to that Claſs of my Readers, is a kind of

               <hi>ASPASIA</hi> very well knows, the firſt
and moſt important Point, which conſiſts in ſtudying their Tempers, and
the Bent of their Inclinations. The Knowledge once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the next Step is,
to improve and heighten their good Qualities, and <hi>artificially</hi> to
transform the Defects and Errors of their Nature, into Graces and Ornaments. As
we muſt <hi>naturally</hi> Love thoſe, whom we deſire to inſtruct; and,
as it is <hi>natural</hi> not to love thoſe, who obtrude Inſtruction upon
us, but to liſten with Attention to thoſe whom we Love, and to gather
Inſtruction from them, as it were <hi>without their Knowledge</hi>; It is,
for theſe Reaſons, methinks Neceſſary, that the Method, generally
obſerved in theſe Caſes, ſhould be Reverſed; that is to ſay, The
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> of the Child ſhould be the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of
a Tutreſs's <hi>Love</hi> towards it, and not her <hi>Love</hi> be the
<hi>Conſequence</hi> of its <hi>taking</hi> her <hi>Inſtructions</hi>:
Theſe Directreſſes of Youth ſhould <hi>begin,</hi> where they generally
<hi>end.</hi> They give their <hi>Advices plainly</hi> and <hi>bluntly,</hi>

<hi>Reſentments:</hi> But they ſhould, <hi>firſt,</hi> Practice upon the
<hi>Affections</hi> of their <hi>Wards,</hi> gain their Hearts, and make their
own <hi>Love ſeen,</hi> and <hi>afterwards</hi> ſteal their Admonitions
into them, under the Covert of Art, keeping them as much as poſſible,
<hi>unſeen.</hi> Inſtruction thus Politically couched, will have a Power,
that is Irreſiſtable, and make an amazing Progreſs in tender Minds.
Advice, not ſeen <hi>by,</hi> will be ſure to be ſeen, <hi>in</hi>
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0199100802:43"/>TO deſcend to Particulars, in our preſent
Caſe: Looking over thoſe Romances and Novels, which her eldeſt
<hi>Ward</hi> delights in, too much, <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> will certainly find
ſome Heroick Examples of Vertue. Theſe ſhe would relate to ſome Friend,
in the Secret, with very great Applauſes, ſo as to be Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard by her
fair Pupil, who will be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for a Judgment, that ſeems to favour her
own, and that ſhe would be glad ſhould do ſo. She will be charmed to hear
this, and remaining, as it were, <hi>perdue,</hi> liſten greedily to it, as
the Commendation of her ſelf. When her Mind is thus ſtrongly prejudiced in
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of her Guardian, when it is warmed, and juſt ready to take the
Impreſſion; then, juſt then, the Guardian has an Opportunity of
preſſing down the Seal of Vertue. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle proper Female Oratory, in
Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the like Paſſages, ſtill more beautifully expreſſed,
in ſuch Books, as ſhe would have her read, will make her long, and beg, of
her own accord, to ſee them. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> might
ſay: Such a noble Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is eminently conſpicuous in the Hero of this
Romance; but then he appears defective in ſuch other Points: The Hero of
ſuch a Novel Revere for ſuch a Part of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but he is greatly to
blame in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: The principal Character in ſuch a Book of
Memoirs, would be a Favourite, and a ſhining Character, but for ſuch and
ſuch Blemiſhes and Imperfections. Such a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0199100802:44"/> in
ſuch a Play, behaves himſelf well throughout the whole Action, and makes me
love him at my very Heart; but ſuch a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant has a villainous Deſign at
Bottom, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Miſtreſs's Honour, and is my mortal Averſion. After
having thus remark'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Texts, out of the Lady's own Scripture, it is
Inexpreſſible, what an Effect it might have, if growing into a ſudden
Rapture, <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> ſhould go on as follows: How does it charm and
tranſport one, to find all theſe Vertues, and none of the oppoſite Vices;
all theſe Beauties without Deformities, united in that one Favourite
Character of mine, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Hero,</hi> deſcribed with all the
Force, with which Vertue can be deſcribed, and painted with all the Beauties
with which Beauty can be painted?—This Method, or ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as
this, would prompt the liſtening, <hi>bookiſh</hi> Ward to a Deſire of
ſeeing that Tract; ſhe would long for it, ſhe would enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it,
ſhe would beg to read it; ſhe would ſet to reading it already prejudiced
in its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; It would gain upon her, in the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till ſhe gained,
what her Guardian would wiſh, from reading it. As ſhe has true Taſte,
this juſt Picture, would beget in her a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of thoſe coarſe
Daubings of a Nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt's groſſer Hand. The ſame may be ſaid of the
<hi>Heroines,</hi> celebrated in her favourite Romances. How much more
charmingly is the <hi>fine Lady,</hi> deſcribed in the Marqueſs of
<hi>Hallifax</hi> his Advice to a Daughter, and ſo of <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0199100802:45"/>
others.—What Fruit may not be hoped and expected:—Reading that
little Book, called, <hi>The Advice to a Daughter,</hi> and the <hi>Lady's
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,</hi> is enough to make young Women learn to <hi>Know
themſelves:</hi> STEELE<hi>'s Chriſtian Heroe,</hi> and the <hi>Gentleman
Inſtructed,</hi> teach them abundantly to know Men. A <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of
<hi>themſelves,</hi> will be the <hi>Preſervative</hi> of their
<hi>Honour</hi>; and a <hi>true Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> will fortifie
them againſt the <hi>Treacheries,</hi> that are uſed by <hi>artful</hi>
Deceivers, of <hi>that Sex,</hi> which is almoſt ſure, one Time or other,

            <p>I INTENDED in this PAPER, to have proceeded upon ſome Hints
concerning EDUCATION: But I am forced to break off the Thread, and defer it to
another Day. I have many entertaining <hi>LETTERS</hi> by me, from
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and <hi>Bath</hi>; and two, that I muſt particularly
mention from <hi>Covent-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> with Relation to my late Diſcourſe on
the <hi>Play-Houſe Management</hi>; One is written by Mr. <hi>Sock,</hi> in a
ſad, and <hi>lamentable</hi> Stile, and the other by Mr. <hi>Buskin,</hi>
filled with ſuch Heroick <hi>Rants,</hi> that, however they excite no
<hi>Terror,</hi> will as well anſwer the <hi>End</hi> of being exhibited to
publick View; and move <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> like ſome <hi>Modern
Tragedies.</hi> With all theſe I ſhould be glad to oblige the
<hi>Publick,</hi> as ſoon as poſſible; but the following EPISTLE, ſeems
intended to Redreſs, in ſome Meaſure, an injured Perſon, and I think it
a Part of Duty to quit other Speculations, though <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0199100802:47"/> never
ſo inviting, where it lies in my Power to <hi>aſſiſt,</hi> towards
reſcuing an honeſt Man, out of <hi>real,</hi> or even <hi>imaginary</hi>
Diſtreſs, ſince the <hi>latter</hi> is often <hi>equally</hi> painful

                  <p> IN One of your PAPERS concerning DETRACTION, you juſtly
obſerved, That Perſons guilty of it, in a great <hi>City,</hi> ought to
have ſome <hi>Diſtinguiſhing Signs</hi> to diſcover them, as
Croſſes are placed on the Doors of the <hi>Diſeaſed,</hi> in the Time
of a Peſtilence.</p>
                  <p> THAT happy Way of Reaſoning (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable from Truth) which
ſhines in all your Writings, on whatſoever <hi>Subject</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
carries Conviction in every Line, that gives the <hi>Good Man</hi> Pleaſure,
and the <hi>Envious</hi> and <hi>Detracting,</hi> Pain.</p>
                  <p> THEN to whom ſhall I apply for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, but to the PLAIN
DEALER, who, tho' above flattering the Great, thinks it not unworthy him, to do
Juſtice, even to the <hi>Loweſt</hi> Degree of Merit.</p>
                  <p> WAS I to draw the Man I mean, in the Character of <hi>Husband,
Father,</hi> or <hi>Friend,</hi> in each, he would pleaſe and ſatisfy; but
as thoſe diſtinguiſhing Characters, are Private, tho' Undiſputed, I
will beg leave to tell you, He has, in <hi>Active</hi> Life, a <hi>Fame,</hi>
that <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0199100802:48"/> gives Uneaſineſs to ſome malignant People,
while it does Good, more widely than they wou'd wiſh him able to extend
it.</p>
                  <p> IF an indefatigable Induſtry, with his allowed
<hi>Skill,</hi> and <hi>Humanity,</hi> crowned by the Bleſſing of the
<hi>ALMIGHTY,</hi> with un-interrupted Succeſs, can recommend a Man to
Eſteem in the uſeful Profeſſion of of <hi>Surgery,</hi> you will allow
me to name Mr. <hi>Coltheart.</hi> Methinks I ſee him, (as I have often
ſeen him) going to the Relief of ſome miſerable Object, with his uſual
Chearfulneſs and Smiles (with that Regard however to the Cauſe, which the
Greateſt could wiſh for, the Unhappy ſeldom find) as if he was going to
ſome Great Man, whoſe Cure muſt make his Fortune; tho' he is certain to
have no other Recompence than the Thanks and Prayers of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended
Patient.</p>
                  <p> INNUMERABLE Inſtances of this Kind the Grateful Many he has
ſerved, wou'd give, who, tho' willing, are not allow'd to do him the
Juſtice he deſerves; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces me to believe, if ever Man took
Pleaſure in doing Good, he does; as alſo to think him a proper Subject, and

               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0199100802:49"/>WHEN I reflect upon the many Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
ariſing to Mankind, from the Skill of a True Profeſſor of the Surgeon's
Art, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo Uſeful a Member of the Common-Wealth, that he makes no
<hi>inconſiderable</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure among the moſt <hi>conſiderable,</hi>
like <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaon</hi> among the Heroes in <hi>Homer.</hi> The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, this
Letter relates to, far from meriting to be ſpoken ill of, deſerves that
reſpect, which the beſt of all Books requires to be paid to the
Phyſician, if it was for nothing elſe, but having, not long ſince,
preſerved the Life of a Member, of a very noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in which
<hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi> have been a long Time
<hi>Hereditary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS I am brought once more, unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, to touch upon that hated
Subject, <hi>DETRACTION,</hi> I think I cannot do better, in order to deter
People, from it, than to place before their Eyes a Picture of its Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
as it was drawn by that Great Maſter <hi>APELLES,</hi> and Deſcribed by an
excellent old Author.</p>
            <q> 
               <p> AT the Right-Hand, was drawn Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, a Man, with long Ears,
put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth his Hand to <hi>DETRACTION,</hi> who ſeem'd from afar off to
come towards him. About this Man ſtood two Women, that is to ſay,
<hi>IGNORANCE</hi> and <hi>SUSPICION:</hi> On the other ſide came
<hi>DETRACTION,</hi> a Woman dreſs'd in great Pomp and Magnificence, but in a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0199100802:50"/> mighty Paſſion of Anger, having her Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect like
Fire. In her Left-Hand, ſhe held a burning Torch, and with her other, ſhe
drew, by the Hair of his Head, a young Man, who held up his Hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven, calling God, to Witneſs his Innocence: With Her, came a Woman, Pale
and Evil-favoured, beholding the the young Man attentively, like one that had
been conſumed with long Sickneſs, whom you might eaſily conjecture to be
<hi>ENVY.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> THERE followed two other Women, who made it their Buſineſs to
adorn <hi>DETRACTION:</hi> One was <hi>TREASON,</hi> the other <hi>FRAUD:</hi>
After, followed a Woman in Mourning, Black and Ragged, called
<hi>REPENTANCE,</hi> who turning her Back, and ſore aſhamed, beheld
<hi>TRUTH,</hi> who then came forward.</p>
            </q>
            <p>IT is thus, <hi>APELLES</hi> deſcribed <hi>DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRACTION,</hi> by
which he himſelf was brought into extream Danger, having been falſely
accuſed to King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who, upon his refuting
the Accuſation, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him as many Talents, as would amount to Twelve
Thouſand Pounds Sterling, and that his Accuſer ſhould be his perpetual
Bonds-man.</p>
            <p>IF ſome curious Engraver would form a Plate, upon this Model;
the beſt Method would be for Perſons this way Injured, to 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0199100802:51"/> purchaſe a Ptint, and fix it, like a Play-Bill, at the
Door of any noted Offender; after which, it ſhould be a Rule for the
Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, never to believe a Report that came from that Quarter, whether
in <hi>Praiſe</hi> or <hi>Diſpraiſe</hi> of any Body.</p>
            <p>BY this Means, the <hi>TONGUES</hi> of <hi>Evil-Speakers,</hi> and
the <hi>PENS</hi> of <hi>Evil-Writers,</hi> would become <hi>Uſeleſs,</hi>
and <hi>Unregarded</hi>; and Innocence, having nothing to fear, might look,
untrembling, upon Slander.</p>

            <p>AMONG a Thouſand ſhining Proofs of the Capacity of <hi>Woman's

publiſh, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Advance of <hi>Feminine Learning.</hi> Tho', when
I conſider the Force of the Sex's <hi>Natural Magick,</hi> I obſerve with
ſome Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, their Pretenſions to the <hi>ART</hi> of
<hi>CONJURING.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Common-Council Man of this Great City, writes to me, with much
Impatience, to be inform'd, Whether there is no Statute, <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0199100802:53"/>
in Force, againſt the Study of the <hi>BLACK ART?</hi> I was at a Loſs,
what <hi>Art</hi> he meant, 'till he went on to inform me, That he can never
make his Viſits, to a certain Lady, of his Acquaintance, but his Wife knows
where he has been; and ſhews him, for Proof of it, <hi>a Man and a Woman, in
a China Cup,</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, cloſer than they ſhou'd be, by means of
certain Tell-tale <hi>HIEROGLYPHICKS,</hi> in the ſettling of her
<hi>Coffee-Grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>APPLICATION has been alſo made to me, by the Husbands of ſome

Wiſe, when <hi>aſleep,</hi> as <hi>waking.</hi>—One poor Gentleman,
in particular, has been kept at Home, theſe ſix Days, upon a Dream which
his Wife had, <hi>That an</hi> Owl <hi>flew out of her Boſom, and met with
a</hi> Jack-Daw, <hi>that pick'd his Eyes out.</hi> This has <hi>abſolutely

                  <p> YOU were pleas'd, in a late <hi>PLAIN DEALER,</hi> to threaten
the Male-World with an Inundation of <hi>Female-Wit.</hi> Before we are ſo

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0199100802:54"/> who is

                  <p> I THINK it a wiſe Man's Part, to be <hi>humble,</hi> in the
midſt of <hi>Preferment,</hi> and wou'd, therefore, be underſtood to
<hi>ſpeak without boaſting,</hi> when I inform You, That I am able to read
my own Name, among the Worſhipful, The Commiſſioners for Conſervation
of His Majeſty's <hi>Peace.</hi>—But I have a <hi>Wife!</hi> who, not
to praiſe her, more than ſhe really deſerves, wou'd have made a better
<hi>Juſtice</hi> than I am.—Her Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding blazes out, to the
Admiration of All, who know her; only, like Wood, that is too vigorous, ſhe
is apt to <hi>ſnap,</hi> a little, in her flaming: For which, in order to be
Even with her, I have given her the Name of <hi>SNUBSY.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> THE worſt of it is, She confines her Talent to <hi>one
Science:</hi> And, ſo, her Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which, if divided, might have adorn'd
a hundred Arts, are, All, profuſely laviſh'd, for Improvement of that
ſingle Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p> MY Spouſe, good Sir, to be plain with you, is far gone in
<hi>Palmeſtry</hi>: But <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>She,</hi> being intimate
Acquaintance, Her own Name for it, is <hi>Chiromancy.</hi>—If
<hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude</hi> lay in her Palm, ſhe cou'd not fail to
<hi>diſcover</hi> it; and be <hi>paid for her peeping.</hi>—My
Brothers, of the Bench, you know, are not without ſome Wit their Way; and 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0199100802:55"/> moſt of them can <hi>crack a Joke,</hi> when we meet,
over a Bottle.—I venture now and then, to <hi>puſh a Pun,</hi> upon
theſe Occaſions: And they All know, as well as I do, That I have no
<hi>cloſe-fiſted</hi> Wife, tho' ſhe <hi>makes a good Hand of
me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> I ALLOW her a <hi>Study,</hi> to herſelf, at the End of a

thro' the Key-hole, to ſee her Thumbs as high as her Eyes; and half a Score
reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Philoſophers, who Treat on this Deep Myſtery, lying ſpread, on
a Table, before her.—She has <hi>Fortune,</hi> at her Fingers Ends! and
never <hi>Sybil</hi> propheſied, with ſuch unwearied Application.</p>
                  <p> IT gives me no ſmall Delight, to obſerve how buſie ſhe
will be, in looking over my <hi>Line of Life:</hi> And really ſometimes ſhe
<hi>hits</hi> Things ſtrangely! One wou'd almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſhe has
<hi>more Help than ſhe ſhou'd have!</hi>—My <hi>CEPHALICA,</hi>
(which, you are to know, is my <hi>Head Line</hi>) has, it ſeems, a
<hi>Forkey Figure,</hi> in the midſt of it, that points, with both Horns,
againſt my <hi>Linea Vitalis.</hi>—I don't know why it is, but ſhe
always <hi>laughs,</hi> when ſhe ſees this Mark; and ſays, She is ſure
<hi>ſome Good</hi> will come of it, becauſe the But-end of the Fork points
from the <hi>Dragon's Tail,</hi> to the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Venus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> THO' I believe her at my Heart, yet I pretend to make a Doubt
of it; becauſe <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0199100802:56"/> there can be no <hi>prettier
Diverſion,</hi> than to ſee how ſhe <hi>frets,</hi> and what a deal of
good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd Pains ſhe will take, to convince me of it!—I muſt own, I
ſtand amaz'd at the Improvement of her Natural Parts, by the Benefit of
frequent Practice, upon Secrets, I am utterly a Stranger to!</p>
                  <p> WE have a New Miniſter in our Pariſh, and, the firſt Time
he came to dine, at our Houſe, I ſhall never forget how he ſtar'd, when
<hi>SNUBSY</hi> began to ſhew her Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!—She no ſooner looked in
his Hand, than ſhe told him, He would be made a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> He is
counted a Man of <hi>Letters,</hi> and yet he was not able to
<hi>diſprove</hi> it; tho' he own'd, indeed, <hi>It was unlikely:</hi> For,
ſhe reduced it to a Demonſtration, little leſs than
<hi>Mathematical</hi>; by <hi>Squares, Trines, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Stars, Spots, Tokens,
Signs, Lines,</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> of a thouſand different Sorts,
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, Tranſverſe,</hi> and <hi>Parallel:</hi> Purſuing every
Argument, with an invincible Force of Reaſoning, through the <hi>Cavea
Martis,</hi> to the <hi>Via Solis</hi>; and unravelling all the
<hi>Croſſes,</hi> in the <hi>Tuberculum,</hi> on the <hi>Mons
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turni;</hi> 'till ſhe came within reach of the <hi>Via Lactea,</hi> under
the <hi>Girdle</hi> of <hi>Venus:</hi> And there the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſtopt
her, and made Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements of his Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p> WE went lately to ſhew <hi>Bedlam,</hi> to a
Country-Couſin, who came up to viſit us: And, in the middle of the long
Room, my <hi>SNUBSY</hi> took a Fancy, to let her Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0199100802:57"/> woman ſee how fine a Skill ſhe was Miſtreſs of: In
order to which, ſhe fell to reading us a <hi>Lecture,</hi> over the Palm of a
ſilent <hi>Lunatic</hi>; who, with a Rugg about his Shoulders, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quietly
gave her his Hand, through the <hi>Grate</hi> he was ſtanding at—She
had juſt pointed out, How his <hi>Mons Mercurii</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afflicted, by an
Evil-line, from his <hi>Mons Lunae,</hi> when the Patient beſprinkled her
Face, with a Bowl-full of a certain Ill-ſcented Liquor, of his own making,
which his other Hand had concealed behind him. We were, all, in good Meaſure,
made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Bounty. But my Couſin, and I, were beginning to quit
ſome Part of it, which we thought we ſhould have no Uſe for, when we were
interrupted by our dripping <hi>Chiromancer,</hi> who ran between us, all in
Tranſport, holding her Hands as high as our Eyes, and crying out, with great
Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence, That <hi>Her Fears were now over</hi>;—For ſhe had
foreſeen, by a <hi>Combuſt-Line,</hi> between her <hi>Pollex</hi> and her
<hi>Cardiac,</hi> That ſhe ſhould be in Danger of a Violent Death, either
by <hi>Drowning</hi> or <hi>Suffocation!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IT is not in my Power to explain to you All the Benefits, which
I receive from this Profoundneſs of my Spouſe's
<hi>Foreſight.</hi>—Other People, when they take <hi>New Servants,</hi>
are forc'd to ſend, and enquire their <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:</hi> But my little
Conjurer, does but peep upon their Palms, and ſatisfies her ſelf
immediately.—I had a very ſtrong Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0199100802:58"/> for a
ſmiling Country, Girl, that came, laſt Week, to offer her Service, in the
Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a <hi>Chamber-Maid.</hi> But upon the very firſt Inſpection, my
Examiner charg'd her Home, With <hi>Three Favourite Sweethearts</hi>; and then
whiſpered ſomething in her Ear, which ſhe ſtaid not to return an
Anſwer to; but ran, bluſhing, out of Doors, in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Hurry and
Diſorder. And this <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> my <hi>Caſſandra</hi>
aſſured me, was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meerly upon <hi>Palmiſtry</hi>; the Girl having
a manifeſt <hi>Triangle,</hi> on the Bottom of the <hi>Mount</hi> of
<hi>Venus,</hi> which extended ſo far downward, as to make a <hi>Cleft</hi>
in her <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> I WAS, once, in ſome kind of Danger to have been drawn into a
<hi>Plot</hi>; but my <hi>SNUBSY</hi> found it out, in the Palm of my Hand; and
in Preſence of a <hi>Miniſter of State,</hi> who, I can aſſure You,
made no ſmall Uſe of Her, convinc'd me, beyond Diſpute, that I ſhould
bid fair for being <hi>hang'd,</hi> by Virtue of a <hi>crooked Line, that
croſs'd my</hi> Via Combuſta. This frighted me from my fooliſh Purpoſe:
But, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I was ſtrangely comforted, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, at the ſame
Time, upon the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's</hi> opening his Hand too, That his
Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had a <hi>Combuſta,</hi> as <hi>dangerouſly mark'd,</hi> as
mine was.</p>
                  <p> AFTER ſo happy a Deliverance, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of Her Art,
I grew deſirous to be <hi>taught</hi> it; and with a great Deal of Good 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0199100802:59"/> Succeſs I got over the Heathen Names of her
<hi>Planets</hi>; and knew what Parts of her Hand they <hi>kept Houſe</hi>
in. I was wonderfully pleaſed with <hi>VENUS,</hi> when I found, in my
<hi>Primmer of Palmeſtry,</hi> That ſhe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Woman-kind,
Kiſſes,</hi> and <hi>Ladies Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi> But I could never away
with <hi>MER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURY</hi>; For her <hi>Books</hi> were pleas'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, That
he held his Influence over <hi>Pages, Pimps,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers; Juſtices
of the Peace,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologers.</hi> I thought it, from that Time
forward, unbecoming my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Gravity, to apply my ſelf to an Art, that
had treated my Office with ſuch Indignity. And, as often as I caſt my Eye
upon theſe Venerable Words, <hi>Juſtice of the Peace,</hi> and ſaw them
mix'd with ſuch Ill Company, I clos'd my Fiſt in a Fury, and would ſtudy
<hi>Palmiſtry</hi> no longer.</p>
                  <p> YET, in the Way my <hi>SNUBSY</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, Truth compells
me to confeſs, It is an inexhauſtable Fund of Benefits, both to my Self,
and to the Publick.—If I happen to be ſick, ſhe conſults
<hi>not</hi> my <hi>Pulſe,</hi> but, my <hi>Palm.</hi> And, when Perſons of
leſs Learning, feel Change of Weather, in their <hi>Toes,</hi> ſhe reads
it, under her <hi>Fingers.</hi> In ſhort, it is impoſſible for any Body,
but One, who knows as much of her as I do, to imagine what ſtrange Sings and
Tokens, ſhe carries about her; and what Great Things they ſignifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0199100802:60"/> To ſuch a powerful Pitch of Perfection
has ſhe rais'd her ſurprizing Skill, that ſhe ſaved a poor Man's Life,
lately, who was brought before me, by a Neighbour's Daughter, in Order to
charge him, upon Oath, With having done no leſs than <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd</hi>
her: But <hi>SNUBSY,</hi> who was for beginning the Examination, in her own
Way, no ſooner ſaw the Inſide of their Hands, than ſhe convinced the
Sufferer, very ſeaſonably, That the Accident was <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable</hi>;
having been foretokened, by a plain <hi>Inciſure,</hi> on the Center of her
<hi>Via La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctea:</hi> So that being <hi>decreed,</hi> from Both their Births,
this Misfortune became a <hi>Fate</hi>; and it would have been in vain to have
ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled againſt it.—The poor Girl wept, and thanked her; and, with
charitable Change of Purpoſe, told the Priſoner, That <hi>ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
him heartily; for ſhe thought it Hard, To have a Man hanged for doing
Nothing, but what he was</hi> born <hi>for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IN Juſtice to the Merit of a Wife, ſo deeply learn'd, I
could do leſs than deſire you to acquaint the World with my

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p> IN my Laſt, I laid before You a ſhort Character of the
preſent Magiſtrates of this <hi>City</hi>; and ſome Account of the
Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Spirit, that too often diſturbs Them, and their Laudable
Undertakings. I am not at all ſurpriz'd to hear, That many of your
<hi>Readers,</hi> among my own <hi>Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> have taken Offence at my
Free Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, notwithſtanding the Sanction of <hi>your</hi>
Judgment, under which it is publiſhed.</p>
                  <p> PREJUDICE will always make the World Uneaſie: Whatever
Cauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from, it never fails to govern the Underſtanding, in a
very ſhameful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And, tho' it is often no more than the imbib'd Senſe
of a ſecond Perſon, which a Man makes uſe of as his own, it 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0199100802:62"/> is rarely, and with great Difficulty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from
producing innumerable bad Conſequences in Life, with the Face and Appearance
of ſomething that is Good; it mixes it ſelf with every Circumſtance and
Action, and has every where a powerful Influence. One Man calls it
<hi>Religion,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Principle</hi>; and he who dares be Blunt, owns
it by its plain Name of <hi>Party.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done, or ſaid, upon this
Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though never ſo Faulty, ſhall find <hi>Advocates</hi>; and,
however Praiſe-worthy, <hi>Condemnation.</hi> What a Shame is it to
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to hear it avow'd, That ſuch a Sett of Men can do Nothing
<hi>Ill,</hi> becauſe <hi>on our Side?</hi> And ſuch another, Nothing
<hi>Well,</hi> becauſe <hi>they Vote with our Enemies?</hi>—But Enough
of this Subject.—If, as 'tis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally own'd, The Publick Good ſhould
be the Point moſt in View, of each Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, I ought to reſt
ſatisfied, and may deſpiſe the Spleen of my Cenſurers.</p>
                  <p> BUT, Sir, I am inclined to conſtrue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, and,
perhaps, the Indignation that ſome People expreſs againſt good
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and good Things, is not ſo much the Effect of <hi>Vice,</hi> as
of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> As when a <hi>Scheme</hi> is propoſed for Publick
Benefit, <hi>Blockheads</hi> may innocently decry it, becauſe they cannot
comprehend it. This I take to be the preſent Caſe, from the dull
Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that I have wonder'd to ſee made againſt ſeveral highly
generous and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0199100802:63"/> Undertakings. Men, whoſe Souls
are ſhort-ſighted, love to walk in Old <hi>Ways,</hi> becauſe they are in
no Danger of being <hi>loſt,</hi> while they have a Hedge at each Elbow. Thus
the <hi>Hotentots</hi> adhere to their Hereditary Dirt and Nakedneſs: Thus
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> too, were formerly inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>rebel againſt
the Yoke,</hi> in Defence of their ancient Privilege of <hi>drawing Ploughs by
their Horſes Tails,</hi> with all the <hi>Wit</hi> of a <hi>free-born</hi>
Stedfaſtneſs. And, I am ſorry I have Cauſe to ſay, That for a
Reaſon of this goodly Sort, my <hi>Neighbours</hi> love ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Streets,
and hate the Innovation of <hi>Neceſſary Houſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IF in this Part of the World, we chance to hear of a
<hi>Project to make us Cleanly,</hi> we wonder at the <hi>crack-brain'd
Whimſie,</hi> and guard our Hearts againſt <hi>Vanity.</hi> If it is
undertaken at the particular Expence of the Propoſer, we diſcourage the
Guilt of ſo preſuming a Generoſity. Nay, let a Thing be actually
executed, and compleatly done to our Hands, we have ſtill Spirit enough to
<hi>rail</hi> at it, with the moſt maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Inflexiblity. In this, and
other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, I have Inſtances in my <hi>View</hi>; and my
<hi>Neighbours</hi> will take my <hi>Meaning,</hi> tho' not my
<hi>Counſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IT were eaſie, SIR, to expatiate upon the <hi>Ignorance,</hi>
and <hi>Partiality,</hi> that prevail among our People, were I inclined to
write <hi>Satyr,</hi> and expoſe the Weakneſs of my <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0199100802:64"/>
Country-men. But, as I am unwilling to ſpread their Defects, I beg Leave, on
the the other Side, to lay before you ſeveral more of the Bleſſings and
Ornaments our <hi>City</hi> boaſts of!</p>
                  <p> YOU have done us the Honour, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Genius and
Virtue of ſome of the riſing <hi>Generation,</hi> in one of your PAPERS;
and my laſt begins an Account of the FAIR ASSEMBLY here in
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Oppoſition of our
<hi>Clergy,</hi> is one of the beſt <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of
<hi>Politeneſs</hi> in <hi>SCOTLAND.</hi> By Means thereof, our Youth of both
<hi>Sexes,</hi> learn a Habit of Briskneſs and Freedom, which, till of late,
were leſs frequent among us. That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and Stiffneſs of Air and
Addreſs, which diſtinguiſhed us from People of more generous Education,
by Decrees, wears away; and Converſation, which was formerly ſo confin'd,
and ſo dull, grows open, free, and eaſie: <hi>Ladies</hi> find they may
<hi>ſpeak</hi> to <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> without Violence to their
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> may <hi>entertain Ladies,</hi>
without Deſigns upon their <hi>Virtue.</hi> It is now no more a
<hi>Sight,</hi> when a Lover waits on his Miſtreſs Home, or takes a Walk
with her in a Garden. Nay, we have Husbands, who, without Jealouſie, can hear
Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours invite their Wives to an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In ſhort, we exchange
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Affectation and Gravity, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Liberty and Free Spirit; and, in Place of <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0199100802:65"/> 
                     <hi>Narrow
Minds,</hi> and the <hi>vileſt Hypocriſie,</hi> we are growing Profane
enough to aſſert the <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Humane Reaſon,</hi> and the
<hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Privileges</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> PERHAPS I am not miſtaken, when I affirm, That this
<hi>Converſion</hi> (I beg Leave of the <hi>Clergy</hi> to make Bold with the
Word, becauſe I have as Good a Title to it, as they have) is, in a great
Meaſure, the Effect of the <hi>Union</hi> of the Two Kingdoms. But, when I
conſider it is an Advantage, I wou'd not be thought to mean, that
<hi>either</hi> Nation is yet too Happy under the Effects of their
<hi>Incorporation.</hi> It may be allow'd us, I preſume, to wiſh, that
however ſtrictly they are united, they may never be bound ſo cloſe, but
that one Hand may be looſe enough to aſſiſt and unite the other, if it
is not quite <hi>impoſſible,</hi> there ſhou'd ariſe, in ſome future
Age, ſuch a Miracle, as a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Miniſtry</hi>; or a Prince, leſs
watchful, than our preſent Glorious SOVEREIGN, for the Defence of his Peoples
Liberties.</p>
                  <p> BUT I am no Politician; nor will I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to Enlarge upon a
Subject that fits not the Purpoſe of your PAPER; though I promiſe my
ſelf, That the PLAIN DEALER will not ſcruple, when Occaſions riſe, to
aſſert the <hi>Rights,</hi> as well as the <hi>Senſe</hi> of a <hi>True
Briton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> I PROCEED to Remark, That as the Correſpondence and
Communication between the now United Kingdoms, has, in a great 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0199100802:66"/> Meaſure, improv'd and poliſh'd the <hi>Taſte,</hi>
the <hi>Air,</hi> and the <hi>Faſhions,</hi> of both the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and
Ladies of my Country; ſo it has alſo refin'd our Language, in a very
ſenſible Manner. I do not mean the <hi>Accent</hi> and
<hi>Pronunciation,</hi> when we <hi>ſpeak</hi> it—For theſe are
hardly to be naturaliz'd without much Time, and continual Converſe; there
being, in <hi>England</hi> itſelf, a <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> peculiar to every
County. No wonder then, that <hi>Scots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> find it difficult to come up to
their Standard.</p>
                  <p> BUT, if you'll allow, that we make ſome Progreſs in the
<hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, we will readily give up our
Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the <hi>Graces</hi> of it. Yet our way of pronouncing the
<hi>Vowels</hi> has Advocates in <hi>Foreign</hi> Countries: And, perhaps, the
Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might deſerve a Review with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> I have wonder'd, to ſay Truth, that we are ſuch Proficients
in the Language, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering we have neither a <hi>Court,</hi> nor a
<hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi> which are the acknowledged <hi>Fountains</hi> of its
Refinement.</p>
                  <p> WHEN I look into the Writings of Mr. <hi>DRUMMOND</hi> of
<hi>Hathornden,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>JAMES</hi> I. Sir <hi>GEORGE
MACKENZIE,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> II. The Earl of
<hi>LAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERDALE,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>JAMES</hi> II. Biſhop
<hi>BURNET,</hi> and Mr. <hi>FLETCHER</hi> of <hi>Salton,</hi> in the two
laſt Reigns; and of a certain noted Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0199100802:67"/> in the
preſent; when I compare their Style with the Style of ſome of their
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries in <hi>England,</hi> I am tempted to think my Country-men not
ſo very far inferiour, as that <hi>Criticks</hi> ſhou'd depreciate our
Pretenſions to the Language. But, when I conſider too, That whatever
Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, or Maſtery, of that Sort we arrive at, is as much a
<hi>Virtue</hi> in us, as 'tis <hi>Nature</hi> in You, I am vain enough to
imagine, that we merit no leſs Praiſe; at leaſt ſhou'd meet with fair
<hi>Indulgence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> ONE Thing more I beg leave to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, with Reſpect to our
Language. Many of our Words, that ſeem <hi>Uncouth,</hi> and are not
underſtood by <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> are, notwithſtanding, of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Origin; and are not leſs <hi>Emphatical,</hi> and
<hi>Worthy,</hi> for being <hi>Obſolete</hi> among You. I find few old Words
in <hi>DOUGLAS</hi>'s <hi>VIRGIL,</hi> that are not alſo to be found in
<hi>CHAUCER:</hi> And, perhaps, our <hi>ALLAN RAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAY,</hi> a living
<hi>Verſifier</hi> in Old-Style, uſes few that are not to be met with in
<hi>SHAKESPEAR, SPENCER,</hi> &amp;c.—except, when he coins Words, by
vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his <hi>extra-judicial</hi> Poetick Privileges, that never were, and
never will be, uſed by any Mortal, beſides <hi>Himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> LIVING Languages, are like living Trees; they have their Summer
and their Winter. The <hi>Words</hi> of the One, like the <hi>Leaves</hi> of
the Other, fall off, and are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0199100802:68"/> by a new
Generation. It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Diſcretion's Work, in this Caſe, to Naturalize
none, at the Expence of better.</p>
                  <p> YOU ſee, Sir, with what Freedom I write my Senſe both of
<hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> to you. I own, I obſerve no Order in
the Form of my <hi>Letters:</hi> Nor do I believe <hi>That</hi> wou'd recommend
me more to your Regard. What I chiefly aim at, is, A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>Simplicity</hi> in my Expreſſions, and a <hi>Truth</hi> in my Facts,
becoming a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the <hi>PLAIN DEALER.</hi>

            <p>AFTER having thank'd my Correſpondent, for the Continuance of
his agreeable Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, I ſhall cloſe with a ſhort Remark on on what
he ſays, concerning our Language.</p>
            <p>I AGREE with Him entirely, that many of of our old Words had the
ſame <hi>Original</hi> with theirs; for all that Part of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to the the Southward of the <hi>Frith,</hi> was as much <hi>Saxon</hi> as we
were: So then the Foundation of our Language being the ſame, it is not ſo
reaſonable, as I wiſh it were, to allow this ingenious Gentleman the Claim
he makes, in <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0199100802:69"/> Behalf of his Country—That the Elegance
and Maſtery, which are by <hi>Nature</hi> in Us, are a <hi>Virtue</hi> in
<hi>North Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Nature</hi> is certainly alike to both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: The
<hi>Virtue</hi> is moſt due, where the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement was <hi>firſt</hi>
made. The <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> have, at
leaſt, for Ages paſt, been as learned as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and much
more accuſtom'd to foreign Travel and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence. Theſe are the
great, and indeed the only Cauſes of Refinement in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage—For
<hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Luxury</hi> are much more likely to corrupt it, by the
Confuſion they introduce, mixing Degrees and Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and contracting
our Care to regard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as <hi>INTEREST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE then the <hi>Scotch</hi> Language was once the very ſame
with the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and ſince their People have been more intimately
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, than ours, among Foreign Nations; and have always enjoy'd the
ſame Aſſiſtance of Learning, and yet have been behind us in the
Improvement of our common Tongue; it follows by Neceſſity, That the
Praiſe of <hi>Virtue</hi> is in ours—But it is a <hi>Birth-right,</hi>
which, like <hi>Kentiſh Gavel-Kind,</hi> we muſt equally divide with our
Brothers, in the next Generation: for, tho' they were ſlow Setters out, they
have prov'd Themſelves as good Runners, and will be a-breaſt with us, in
the Race, and loſe no Ground for the Future.</p>

of, is frequent enough: But this fine-ſpirited, and diſcerning Lady, has
placed it on the Perſon who has, hitherto, been look'd on as moſt Innocent,
and deſerving Pity.—The Truth is, there are a thouſand Reſemblances
of <hi>Virtue,</hi> which if unmaſq'd, by ſo diſtinguiſhing a Hand as
<hi>AMANDA</hi>'s, wou'd aſſume their proper Faces, and be known for
<hi>Vices,</hi> and <hi>Follies.</hi>—I will entertain my Readers, with
this Lady's Excellent LETTER, juſt as I receiv'd it, and afterward, in
Obedience to her Command, conſider the Complaint, which is the SUBJECT of
it.</p>

                  <p> WHEN Parents have ſo much Zeal for their Childrens
<hi>Promotion,</hi> and ſo little for their <hi>Happineſs,</hi> as to force
them to <hi>Marry</hi> the Perſon they have an <hi>Averſion</hi> to, How is
the World mov'd, with a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Concern! And Nature ſhock'd with the
Violence!</p>
                  <p> SUCH a Conſtraint has always met with its juſt
Diſcouragement: And your <hi>Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in</hi> PLAIN DEALING took it
under his Care. But, Whether it is from the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>one Sex,</hi>
who are fond of the <hi>Reputation,</hi> even, of a Lover whom they
<hi>Hate</hi>! Or, from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt <hi>Partiality,</hi> of the
<hi>Other,</hi> The much greater Offender, in my Opinion, paſſes
uncenſured.—Such <hi>Parents</hi> are ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd with
<hi>Inhumanity,</hi> and well they may! But what ſhall we ſay of
<hi>Him,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to <hi>teize</hi> the Woman, who <hi>abhors</hi>
him? who wou'd force her to make a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute</hi> of her <hi>Love?</hi>
To enſlave herſelf to Intereſt? And, when her Refuſal has drawn down
the Reſentment of her Parents, lays it, all, on his <hi>Exceſs of
Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IS Love then ſo <hi>baſe</hi> a Paſſion? So void of
Tenderneſs? So unlike itſelf, and all its generous Pretences? that it can
feed on the <hi>Quiet</hi> of the beloved Object! and <hi>ſteal from it</hi>
the Joy which it has not Power to <hi>give it!</hi> No, no, The real Lover
knows not how to <hi>Offend.</hi>—His Happineſs <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0199100802:72"/>
muſt riſe, and fall, with <hi>Hers,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd his
Paſſion.—But if, on the contrary, His Deſires run <hi>Counter</hi>
to her Happineſs, It is not <hi>Love</hi>; It is <hi>Brutality!</hi> And, if
He, who is thus <hi>poſſeſs'd,</hi> ſuppoſes Himſelf in Love, He is
deceiv'd, and wou'd deceive Others.</p>
                  <p> BUT, even granting, All This were the real Effect of Love, on
the Part of the Purſuer, where can a <hi>Woman</hi> find That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delightful
Harmony, That inexhauſtible Spring of Bliſs, which we are taught to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, in <hi>Loving?</hi> Can the Conſtancy of an unlov'd Lover ever win
her to a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? No—rather <hi>Prepoſſeſſion</hi> will guard
the Paſſes of her Heart, nor ſuffer it to be brib'd by Obligations; And
<hi>Time</hi> does but add to our Hatred: For Opportunity finds out Faults, and
furniſhes <hi>Reaſons</hi> for our Refuſal.—In ſhort, ſuch a
Lover ſhows more <hi>Extravagance,</hi> than <hi>Conſtancy</hi>; more
<hi>Inhumanity,</hi> than <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> THIS, Sir, is <hi>my own</hi> Misfortune, to be miſerably
haunted, by the Man, whoſe Sight is Odious to me: One, whom no Words can
convince! No Denials ſatisfie! No affronts affect! Inſenſible of my
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs; and Indefatigable, in creating it!—I wou'd fly him, but
I cannot, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I wou'd fly my Friends too, and my Parents: Nor have I any
<hi>Intimate</hi> left, whom his Diligence, and Inſinuations, have not made
his Own.</p>

            <p>IT the Admiration, which is due to ſuch a Merit as this Lady's,
did not place her above Pity, I cou'd be ſorry for that Perſecution, which
ſhe Laments, in ſo <hi>Elegant,</hi> and <hi>Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> a Manner. The
Gentleman, who is ſo unhappy as to be the Subject of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, will be
the laſt, that feels the Force of it.—There is a <hi>Love of
ourſelves,</hi> deeply rooted in human Nature, that impoſes on us, firſt,
and, then, emboldens us to impoſe on Others. We do not <hi>approve</hi> the
Faults, which we are guilty of; But, which is almoſt as bad, we <hi>cannot
ſee</hi> them:—We join hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily in, with thoſe, who condemn the very
Follies which are moſt remarkably <hi>our own</hi>; and are all the while
inſenſible how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous we appear to Others, by adhering pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0199100802:74"/> to the <hi>Practice</hi> of what we, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
continue to <hi>Cenſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is, I muſt confeſs, the hardeſt Leſſon of Nature, to
correct the Extravagancies of <hi>Love.</hi>—Where this Paſſion is
Real, It will be the <hi>Sovereign</hi> of the Mind. It moulds the Soul to its
own Purpoſes; and lends its own Eyes to the Underſtanding. Neither does it
depend, for its Violence, or Moderation, on the Capacity of the Lover, but on
the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, in which it actuates him. The Wiſe Man, in this Caſe, has
no Prerogative, above the Fool. It is in <hi>Love,</hi> as it in
<hi>Madneſs,</hi> The more Exalted the <hi>Genius,</hi> the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
the <hi>Raging!</hi>—A Wiſe Man may much better <hi>defend</hi>
himſelf, than a Fool can; But, when He <hi>yields,</hi> there is no
Difference; becauſe <hi>Opinion,</hi> in this Paſſion, always ſtands in
the Place of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS being the Caſe, <hi>AMANDA</hi> has ſmall Encouragement;
who, by appealing to what is <hi>Reaſonable,</hi> would diſſwade her
Lover from what is <hi>Neceſſary.</hi>—Her Charms have deprived his
Life of every Comfort, but what <hi>She</hi> gives it; and, while He loves, at
the Rate ſhe ſays he does, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him, to
<hi>think</hi> himſelf ſo much in the Wrong, as ſhe finds him.</p>
            <p>IT would, certainly, be a Great Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if Men, who love,
without Hope, could deſiſt, without Miſery: For, beſides that
<hi>AMANDA</hi>'s Argument has thrown an Air of ungenerous Selfiſhneſs, on
the <hi>Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> 
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0199100802:75"/> of ſuch Addreſſes, there
is This further Miſchief in it, That a Lover, whom an avowed <hi>Hatred</hi>
cannot repulſe, in his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, cuts off his Right, when he becomes a
<hi>Husband,</hi> to complain of, or return, <hi>Ill Uſage,</hi>—Is
ſhe too Cold, too Unkind, too Diſdainful, for a <hi>Wife?</hi>—How
much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is His Fault, who <hi>foreſaw</hi> all This, and, yet, would
<hi>make her one?</hi>—He <hi>loved</hi> Her, before She <hi>pitied</hi>
Him, and conſented to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>His,</hi> notwithſtanding the moſt open
<hi>Profeſſion</hi> of her Inſenſibility! And how Baſe, and
Ungenerous muſt it be, To make the <hi>Continuance</hi> of that
Inſenſibility his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for treating her Ill, after ſhe has put her
ſelf under his Protection; which, while ſhe refus'd, and deteſted him,
had no Power to move his Reſentment!</p>
            <p>EITHER, He ought, with a manly Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to <hi>tear</hi>
himſelf from the Remembrance of an Object, ſo inſenſible of his
Torments; or, in Gratitude, for a Compliance, that was Involuntary, and the
Effect, rather, of Compaſſion, than of Love, He ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to
ſupport himſelf under the Misfortune of her Averſion, without permitting
his own Sentiments to be imbittered, by the Effects of it; till, by a
Progreſs of perſwaſive Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, He ſhall have touched her reluctant
Heart, and prepared it to receive Impreſſions, as well of <hi>Love,</hi> as
of <hi>Gratitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, how Monſtrous is the Brutal Figure, which I have ſeen
ſome <hi>Husbands</hi> make! <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0199100802:76"/> who, when <hi>Lovers,</hi>
were the Pooreſt, and moſt Abject, of all <hi>Slaves!</hi>—When they
ſhould be <hi>Defenders,</hi> they are <hi>Tyrants</hi>; and when it was
reaſonable for them to have been <hi>Provoked,</hi> they were <hi>ſtupidly
Submiſſive!</hi>—How contemptible is their unmanly Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! A
moroſe and reſtleſs <hi>Peeviſhneſs,</hi> makes up the Behaviour they
expect to <hi>charm by!</hi> They contract a ſurly, ſower Habit, from the
Diſappointments they meet in Life; and, inſtead of ſoftening the Edge of
Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, toward the Woman, who is bound to ſhare their Sufferings, they
double them on <hi>her Head,</hi> from whom, (in Honour, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity) they
ought to ward off Sorrow, by a noble Sweetneſs, and endearing Tenderneſs in
their whole Behaviour!</p>
            <p>BUT the pleaſanteſt Stupidity of all, is, That when, by a
Length of Savage Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they have made themſelves compleatly Odious;
they are impudent enough to <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, How it happens that their Wives appear
no fonder of them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is no Part of our Life that requires a nicer Conduct than
our Choice of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with whom we are to <hi>vow an inſeperable
Union;</hi> and, yet, there is Nothing, which we venture on, with more
Raſhneſs; or which we examine, with ſo little Foreſight!—And,
hence it is, That <hi>MATRIMONY,</hi> with equal Satyr, and Juſtice, has been
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, by one of our Old Poets, To a <hi>Crowd</hi> in the <hi>Street,</hi>
which excites a Curioſity, in <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0199100802:77"/> every
<hi>Paſſer-by,</hi> to add one Fool to the Number: But, they are no
ſooner in the midſt of the Preſs, than they grow uneaſy at their
Situation, and are as Eager to elbow out again, as they were, before, to gain
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>

               <hi>State</hi> upon me: And before the <hi>Winter</hi> is

            </p>
            <p>I WAS walking, the other Day, near the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi>
and took up a little <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> that lay in my Way, at a Bookſeller's
Shop, Intituled, <hi>New, and Accurate Obſervations, on the Coaſt of
GUINEA.</hi>—I was pleas'd with this Subject: For, tho' I inform'd my
<hi>Reader,</hi> my firſt ſetting out, That I was an <hi>Enemy to the
Eaſt-India Company,</hi> (by which hangs a <hi>Secret,</hi> that may be
diſclos'd in ſome future Paper) yet I am a <hi>Lover of THE ROYAL
AFRICAN:</hi> And have good <hi>Reaſons,</hi> for <hi>both Opinions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Gentleman, who is Author of the above-mention'd
<hi>Treatiſe,</hi> is a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return'd from the
<hi>Coaſt</hi> he writes of.—He ſeems to be a Perſon of
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>; and expreſſes himſelf with a
Warmth of <hi>Spirit,</hi> that carries in it a Generous <hi>Plainneſs,</hi>
and a rough, but Manly, <hi>Integrity.</hi>—When I began to peruſe his
<hi>Book,</hi> I thought He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd too <hi>Angry:</hi> But, before I had
read it out, the <hi>ill Uſage</hi> He complains of, ſeem'd incapable of
being remember'd, without an Agitation of ſuch Paſſions, as muſt leave
him fully acquitted.—The <hi>Abuſes</hi> and
<hi>Miſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements,</hi> which this Gentleman enumerates, are ſuch, as I
am ſorry to hear of, becauſe their <hi>Conſequences</hi> muſt affect
the <hi>Company,</hi> in too ſenſible a <hi>Manner.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0199100802:80"/>I HAVE often reflected, not without the
utmoſt Amazement, from what ſtrange <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> it ſhou'd happen,
That the <hi>Credit</hi> of <hi>that Company</hi> has been ſunk, to ſo low
an <hi>Ebb</hi>; ſince nothing can be more demonſtrable, than that It has
<hi>Advantages,</hi> beyond Compariſon, above all others, to make it ſelf
the moſt <hi>Flouriſhing!</hi>—If any Deficience, within
themſelves, with Regard to <hi>Stock,</hi> or <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,</hi> is the
Prevention of their <hi>Good Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,</hi> methinks, their
<hi>Complaints</hi> cou'd be no ſooner heard, than they wou'd be ſure of a
<hi>Remedy!</hi> For, even as they, now ſtand, no <hi>Company</hi> exiſts,
that is of ſuch <hi>Importance</hi> to the <hi>Nation.</hi>—If the
Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> in Reſpect to <hi>Trade,</hi> depends moſt,
as it certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does, upon her <hi>American Plantations,</hi> thoſe
Plantations do, as certainly, depend on the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> from
<hi>AFRICA.</hi> A <hi>Trade!</hi> that ſtrengthens us, in the very Vitals,
and firſt Principle of <hi>Government:</hi> For it is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually adding
Encreaſe to the Numbers of our uſeful People; far beyond the
progreſſive <hi>Growth</hi> of our <hi>ſlow,</hi> and <hi>Natural
Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Nation,</hi> too, (in Point of <hi>Wealth,</hi> as well as
<hi>Power</hi>) is, to an infinite Degree, more advantag'd than <hi>The
Company,</hi> by Effect of this <hi>Negro Traffick.</hi> When the
<hi>Company</hi> have ſold a <hi>Slave,</hi> That Profit, which they once
make, is <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Benefit,</hi> which he can, ever, bring
them.—But, for the Benefit of the <hi>Nation,</hi> there is no computing
what may be <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0199100802:81"/> gain'd, by him. Not only the Wretch,
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but his Children's Children, after him, down to the lateſt
Generations, are, for ever, doom'd to <hi>Work</hi>; and <hi>All</hi> their
Product is the <hi>Nation's.</hi>—The Difference is Vaſt, and
Infinite!</p>
            <p>THE Extent of Country, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Limits of <hi>This
Company's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> is Prodigious and Aſtoniſhing! For above
<hi>Thirty Degrees,</hi> on one Side, from the <hi>Line,</hi> and about
<hi>Twenty,</hi> from the other, all the <hi>Coaſt</hi> is within their
Limits: So that they have all the <hi>Good,</hi> Variety, of Soils, and of
Latitude, which the <hi>whole World</hi> can afford them.—They have,
conſequently, within their Bounds, a proper Earth and Climate, for every rich
Product, that we pick up here and there, at the remoteſt Diſtances, from
one Side of the <hi>Globe</hi> to the other.—They have not, it is true, a
Claim of Property to the <hi>Lands:</hi> But, how eaſily might they
purchaſe it, as far as cou'd be neceſſary, at Rates too inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
to deſerve the naming?—They have Iſlands too, and Settlements, never
ſubject to the Natives Inſults.—Why might not theſe be cultivated?
Why not <hi>Rice, Sugar, Indigo, Cotton, Ginger,</hi> and <hi>Tobacco,</hi>
brought hence, as well as from <hi>America?</hi> And how much ſooner, and
eaſier?</p>
            <p>IN one ſhort and comprehenſive View, may be ſeen a
Demonſtration of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as to the <hi>Company's Profit,</hi>
between the <hi>Slaves</hi> they tranſport to <hi>America,</hi> and thoſe 
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0199100802:82"/> whom they might employ, if they pleas'd, to raiſe
Products, for their own Benefit.</p>
            <p>TO ſay nothing of the Charge of Shipping them, which wou'd be
ſav'd, upon All, ſo employ'd, in <hi>Africa</hi>; nor to inſiſt on the
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Advantage, of cheaper <hi>Freight,</hi> and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Voyages,</hi> what can be plainer than this Way of
Reaſoning?—Compute the <hi>Company's</hi> Profit, by the Sale of a
<hi>Negro,</hi> to be Equal with what might be Gain'd by him, in a <hi>Year's
Work,</hi> over and above his Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the Intereſt of his Prime
Coſt, (which it certainly never is) yet, the <hi>Negro,</hi> that
<hi>WORKS</hi> for the <hi>Company,</hi> coſts no more, than One, who is
<hi>SOLD,</hi> for them: Whereas this <hi>Laſt</hi> is wholly
<hi>Loſt,</hi> from that Day forward, to their Intereſt; while the
<hi>Firſt,</hi> returns them Yearly, the <hi>ſame Profit, during Life,</hi>
without new <hi>Charge,</hi> to Balance it.</p>
            <p>I SPOKE, juſt now of Products, which are commonly rais'd, by our
<hi>Planters</hi> in <hi>America</hi>; and might, as certainly, be rais'd in
<hi>Africa</hi>; But there are <hi>Eaſtern Harveſts,</hi> of much greater
Conſequence, which <hi>Time,</hi> I hope, will teach <hi>This Company</hi> to
reap, without more Difficulty, than may gradually be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted!—Why
not the richeſt of the <hi>Eaſt Indian Spices, Pepper, Nutmegs,
Cloves,</hi> and <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> procur'd and planted there? They have
<hi>Soil</hi> and <hi>Climate</hi> exactly the ſame, with thoſe in which
they grow: Nay, they have <hi>wild Spices,</hi> riſing naturally, under their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0199100802:83"/> Agent's Eyes, to be as it were, an <hi>Indication,</hi>
and puſh 'em forward, to Attempt it!</p>
            <p>BUT, if they will not be perſwaded to <hi>tranſplant</hi>
Advantages, at leaſt they might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves of thoſe, which
lie before them. They have <hi>Gold,</hi> which the Natives gather and bring
down to their Forts and Factories. I know what <hi>Difficulties</hi> attend the
<hi>View,</hi> I am about propoſing: And I know too, that tho' they are
<hi>Conſiderable,</hi> they are <hi>far from Unſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable.</hi> What
hinders, then, but that the <hi>Uplands</hi> might be diſcover'd; and perhaps
the <hi>Gold Mines</hi> found, and work'd upon, by the Natives themſelves,
for the <hi>Company's</hi> Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, in Exchange, for what thoſe Natives
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue more, but which wou'd coſt little to their Furniſhers? And this
Attempt, tho' peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eſtabliſh'd and purſued, might, for more certain
Safety, be protected by the Awe of an Armed Force: A very ſmall one, were
ſufficient here, where Numbers are of little Strength, for want of Courage or
of Order.</p>
            <p>HOW much more Uſeful, than ſome of their preſent Factories,
would Forts and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be, a Hundred Miles, or more, in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, One
above the Other, along the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> or ſome other of thoſe
Prodigious <hi>Rivers,</hi> which flow a Courſe of two or three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Miles, through the <hi>Heart</hi> of this vaſt and unknown
<hi>Continent?</hi> How eaſie were it for the People in theſe Forts, to
poſſeſs and cultivate, a large Tract round them? To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the
Bordering <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> and <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0199100802:84"/> make
Leagues with the Neighbouring <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</hi> To maintain a regular and
frequent Correſpondence with each other, by means of Light Veſſels, with
flat Bottoms, adapted to the Navigation propereſt for thoſe
<hi>Rivers:</hi> And once a Year, or oftener, to ſend down their General
Stores, to the <hi>Company's</hi> Ships, at the Entrance, and receive back,
with the Return of their ſmall Veſſels, what ſhould be ſent them from
Home, either for their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or Traffick!—What new, and number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Nations might the <hi>Company</hi> thus <hi>Trade with, at firſt Hand,</hi>
to their unſpeakable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richment?—And were ſuch an Entrance once
open'd to them, by expert and reſolute Adventurers, what popular Encreaſe
of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, would it not occaſion, in our <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and many
other, <hi>Manufactures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are no Impoſſibilies, in Deſigns, of this Nature, but
to narrow and confin'd Underſtandings; and to Spirits of a heavy Fabrick. But
this <hi>Company</hi> has the Honour to be aſſiſted by Great Genius's,
Wiſe, and Enterprizing enough to mark out the Way, to Meaſures that might
ſoon recover them from the preſent <hi>Ill Proſpect of their
Affairs,</hi> and make the Memory of the <hi>ROYAL AFRICAN COMPANY</hi> Dear
and Glorious to all Poſterity.</p>
            <p>IT is a <hi>Work</hi> of too much Length, for ſuch a Paper as
mine is, to <hi>prove</hi> how practicable theſe Things are; But I ſhall,
ſometimes, occaſionally, touch the Subject, with the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0199100802:85"/> I am confin'd to: Becauſe, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider into what
Hands my <hi>Hints</hi> may fall, I flatter my ſelf, they may grow
<hi>Fruitful,</hi> and become a <hi>Service</hi> to my <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Duke of CHANDOS,</hi> in the Head of Theſe, has ſo
Fine, and ſo Enlarg'd a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and is ſo Great, and ſo Acknowledg'd, an
Honour to our Nation, That it is ſcarce poſſible to expreſs, in his
Praiſe, ſo much as every wiſe Man <hi>muſt Think of him!</hi>—I
dare not, therefore, attempt ſo hard a Task as his full Character: But, while
I mention him, I am on Fire, with ſuch an Admiration of his Generous
Qualities, that I cannot forbear to cloſe my Paper, with ſuch faint
<hi>Out-lines,</hi> as can be Sketch'd, by One who <hi>draws</hi> at too much
Diſtance.</p>
            <p>IT is not alone, in the Princely Grandeur of his
<hi>Oeconomy,</hi> that this Illuſtrious Lord reflects a Brightneſs on his
<hi>Honour'd Order,</hi> and points out to us, in a ſhining Light, what a
<hi>Nobleman</hi> was meant to be. <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> He well knows, can be
no more than the <hi>Shadow</hi> of Subſtantial <hi>Glory.</hi>—He
looks inward, therefore, and draws out, into Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Example, ſuch a
ſurprizing Train of <hi>Vertues,</hi> That, inſtead of ſupporting his
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi> upon the <hi>Title,</hi> which was ſo juſtly due to
his, He has added <hi>to it</hi> much more <hi>Honour,</hi> than ſome, who
wear it with a Colder Spirit, have been able to borrow <hi>from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THO' Deſcended from a <hi>Noble Line,</hi> one of the moſt
<hi>Ancient</hi> of the Kingdom! He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0199100802:86"/> to owe
his Greatneſs to the Grandeur of his <hi>Anceſtors:</hi> Nor ever thought
of his <hi>Fore-Father's Honours,</hi> but as an Archer rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his Eye to
the Point of ſome high Steeple, when he would ſhoot his Arrow <hi>over
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW Inconſiderable, in ſo Generous a <hi>Taſte</hi> as
<hi>His,</hi> are all the <hi>Glitterings</hi> of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
Greatneſs!</hi> How much Nobler, after <hi>His, more than Imperial,</hi>
Manner, to adorn and ſerve this Country, his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Expence, than to
be more buſie, to perhaps leſs Purpoſe, and be <hi>Paid,</hi> for his
Want of <hi>Liberty,</hi> at the <hi>Head</hi> of an
<hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE World lies open, to his Eye, and All its Intereſts are
exactly known to him: But nothing can he ſee, in any Part, or happy Corner of
it, more belov'd and worthy, than he himſelf is!—There is this too,
Peculiar in him, That his <hi>Mind,</hi> with all its <hi>Vaſtneſs,</hi> is
ſerenely <hi>Centrical</hi> and <hi>Regular:</hi> His <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes</hi>
are as Rational as Great. His <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> is Clear. His
<hi>Penetration</hi> is Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. His <hi>Reſolution</hi> is Ardent; and
his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> are Calm and Stedfaſt!</p>
            <p>HE knows, and marks, the niceſt Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Dignity and
Pride, Generoſity and Oſtentation; Condeſcenſion and
Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!—He reconciles State with Eaſineſs; and teaches Reverence
to Freedom! How Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive is his Wiſdom! How Unwearied his Induſtry! How
Magnificent his Liberality! How Enlarg'd are his Idea's! How Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0199100802:87"/> by Prejudice! How Unconfin'd to Party!—What
Aſtoniſhment would it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, in the Minds of ordinary Men, could a a
Hiſtory be given the World, of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of thoſe Princely Expences,
which might be charg'd to his Humanity!—The Charity of the Common World
would bluſh, and hide it ſelf at the Compariſon: For the Munificence of
this prodigious <hi>Spirit,</hi> would ſwallow up all other Benignity, as the
Enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> devour'd the Serpents of the
<hi>Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are his <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Publick Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties!</hi> But,
what Amiable <hi>Private Qualities</hi> muſt there be, in ſo exalted a
<hi>Mind!</hi> which are hid from the diſtant <hi>World,</hi> and appear only
to thoſe <hi>Few,</hi> thoſe <hi>very Few,</hi> of his Friends, who not
alone are converſant with him; but have <hi>Souls ſympathetical</hi> enough
to conceive the <hi>Glowings</hi> of his untold <hi>Purpoſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER the Influence of <hi>ſuch a Power,</hi> what may not the

            <p>THERE is no kind of <hi>Wit,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a livelier
Force, or more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Turn of <hi>Spirit,</hi> than That which we
inſcribe on <hi>Monuments,</hi> to expreſs the <hi>Characters</hi> of the
<hi>Dead:</hi> And I am ſorry I have Reaſon to obſerve, That almoſt
every Church, in <hi>England,</hi> is a Witneſs of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience in
it.—The Fire of <hi>Fancy</hi> ſhould, on theſe Occaſions, be
extreamly Intenſe, and Subtile, becauſe, wanting Continuity, it has all its
<hi>Effect</hi> at a <hi>Flaſh</hi>; and can therefore have no
<hi>Medium:</hi> It muſt be either <hi>piercing</hi> or
<hi>contemptible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN I ſtand before the <hi>Tomb</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> I am in Debate with my ſelf concerning
that Delicacy of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which was the Cauſe of its being inſcrib'd
with no more than his <hi>Immortal Name.</hi>—The Noble Founder thought
it Superfluous to add any Thing, after that: <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0199100802:89"/> Becauſe
there ſcarce <hi>lives</hi> a <hi>Reader,</hi> who can be unacquainted with
his <hi>Character.</hi>—Yet, methinks, on the other Hand, the
Expreſſion of a Decent <hi>Gratitude,</hi> may be held Due to a
<hi>Benefactor,</hi> however rais'd above the Want, or Expectation of our
Benevolence. And, to carry it yet farther, tho' no Profanation cou'd be more
unpardonable, than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a <hi>Vulgar Genius,</hi> on a
<hi>Subject</hi> ſo exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is, at leaſt, <hi>One Spirit,</hi> in
the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> greatly Equal to the Labour! And This, the Founder of the
<hi>Monument</hi> muſt have known, more certainly than any other Perſon,
becauſe more nearly converſant with, and more ſufficiently a Judge of,
him.</p>
            <p>I WOU'D not, after this, ſay, I mean Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> but
that, in the Courſe of my <hi>Papers,</hi> I ſhall let him perceive, that I
am no <hi>Flatterer.</hi>—I have wiſh'd to ſee <hi>His Soul</hi> do
Honour to his <hi>Father's Duſt,</hi> and animate a Marble, which can never
be more dignified, than it is, unleſs <hi>His own Remains</hi> ſhou'd
viſit it!—When my <hi>Paſſions</hi> feel his <hi>Force,</hi> in
<hi>Eloiſe's</hi> ſtruggling <hi>Conflicts,</hi> I attend him, thro' the
<hi>Depths</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> with the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is due to
God-like <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy!</hi> And, while my Fancy
flames, and glitters, in the ſportive Vaſtneſs of his <hi>Levity,</hi>
where <hi>Belinda</hi>'s <hi>Hair</hi> attracts him, I am tranſported at his
<hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Gaiety,</hi> and grow <hi>in Love</hi> with his Good

<hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> which has been paid to theſe inimitable

            <p>I HAVE been ſhewn an EPITAPH lately, which is ſaid to have
been written by this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> for the <hi>Tomb</hi> of a Friend of
his: The Thought, on which it turns, is very happy, and extreamly
Natural.—It has been publiſh'd, in ſome of our
<hi>Weekly-Papers</hi>; but not ſo full as I here give it.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>To this ſad Shrine, whoe're thou art, draw near,</l> 
               <l>Here lies the <hi>FRIEND,</hi> moſt wept, the <hi>SON</hi>
moſt <hi>dear,</hi>
               </l> 
               <l>Who ne'er knew <hi>Joy,</hi> but <hi>Friendſhip</hi> might
divide;</l> 
               <l>Nor gave his Father <hi>Grief</hi>—but, when he
<hi>died!</hi>
               </l> 
               <l>How vain is Reaſon! Eloquence, how weak!</l> 
               <l>When <hi>POPE</hi> muſt tell, what <hi>HARCOURT cannot

               </l>

               <l>Ah, no! 'tis vain to ſtrive—It <hi>will not be.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>THE <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> of this fine EPITAPH, which are handed
about Town, have, already, <hi>various Readings:</hi> And in ſome, the two
laſt Lines are wholly omitted. But, I can never ſuppoſe a Caſtration,
of that <hi>Importance, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine</hi>; becauſe the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> at the
firſt Break, has a Strength, ſo full, and diſtinguiſh'd, that 
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0199100802:91"/> it left an abſolute Neceſſity, for a vigorous Turn
of Thought, in the Concluſion of that which follows it: Whereas nothing could
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more languid, and unequal to its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, than to have ended, after
ſo <hi>fine</hi> a <hi>Stroke,</hi> with ſaying no more, than this: <hi>Let
your Friend write your Epitaph; and tell the World, that he is as ſorry for
your Death, as your Father is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE not, I think, at home, read any Piece, of this Kind, more
ſtriking, and ſtrongly rais'd upon the <hi>Force</hi> of its touching
<hi>Simplicity!</hi> But I remember to have ſeen two <hi>Epitaphs,</hi> both,
<hi>Foreign</hi>; which gave me a Delight, of the ſame Nature.—I
ſhall tranſlate them, as near I can, into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi> This,
firſt, is by a <hi>French Poet,</hi> on the Death of <hi>Cardinal
Richlieu:</hi> And has in it, a certain Mixture of the <hi>Great,</hi> the
<hi>Natural,</hi> and the <hi>Surprizing,</hi> which is very rarely to be met
with.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>
                  <hi>Stay, Traveller!—for, All you want, is near,</hi>
               </l> 
               <l>Wiſdom, and Power, I ſeek.—<hi>They, both, lie
here.</hi>
               </l> 
               <l>Nay, but I look for more, and raiſe my Aim,</l> 
               <l>To Wit, Taſte, Learning, Elegance, and Fame.</l> 
               <l>
                  <hi>Here ends your Journey, then: For, here, the STORE</hi>

            </q>
            <p>THE Second, which now follows, is of <hi>Spaniſh Original</hi>;
and was the <hi>Epitaph</hi> 
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0199100802:92"/> of a beautiful Neice of the

            <p>WHERE there is Juſtneſs, and Propriety, in theſe

<hi>Theſe</hi> are unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and therefore ridiculous, when apply'd to any

<hi>Thoughts,</hi> that, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Truth of Meaning, are ſo far from
being Faults, that in all the lighter Kinds of <hi>Poetry,</hi> they are
extremely graceful and deſirable. Thus in the famous <hi>Epigram</hi> of

<hi>Sichaeus,</hi> and, afterwards, died her ſelf, upon <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s

every <hi>Light</hi> that it can be view'd in.—I will give both the

            <p>IT is this Power, in the Conception! This comprehenſive Graſp
of Meaning! where more than can be <hi>expreſs'd,</hi> in Pages, is crowded
into a <hi>ſingle Sentiment,</hi> and inſinuated to the Reader, ſo as to
ſwell, and expand it ſelf, in his Underſtanding! It is <hi>This,</hi>

which is therefore juſtly, call'd <hi>Divine,</hi> becauſe it ſhakes, and
moulds the Soul, and bows to its Purpoſes; tranſports us out of our

own eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing!</p>
            <p>BUT how different from this, is <hi>Poetry,</hi> as it is commonly
underſtood and practis'd!—A trifling Skill in Meaſure, and an eaſie
Sweep in Rhyming, are no more what makes the <hi>Poet,</hi> than the
<hi>Chimes</hi> can be call'd the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>Chariot</hi>

<hi>govern our Selves</hi>; or, admit an Equal Number of <hi>Us</hi> to ſit,
where <hi>Laws</hi> are <hi>made for Us:</hi> And, I believe I may venture to
undertake, for the <hi>Abſent,</hi> That we will be modeſt enough, in that
Caſe, to content our ſelves with a <hi>bare Negative,</hi> upon All Bills,
that concern <hi>Us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> BUT, what ſhall we do, about this <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> of
the <hi>Name?</hi> Old Lady <hi>Lofty</hi> was for having us dignifie our
Purpoſe with the awful Sound of <hi>The SENATE:</hi> But, her Grand-Daughter,
who can read <hi>Horace</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Title</hi> had
an Air, too <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly,</hi> and would <hi>ſit hard,</hi> upon Youth, and
Gaiety.—It was next mov'd, That a <hi>Commitee</hi> of <hi>Virgin
Elders</hi> ſhou'd be ſent, as far as <hi>Poland,</hi> to borrow and bring
Home, the Uſe of the Word <hi>DIET.—Kitty Hoyden</hi> leapt out of our
her Chair, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond this <hi>Motion.</hi>—She had been inform'd,
ſhe ſaid, That <hi>Poliſh Diets</hi> are often ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to meet,
<hi>on Horſeback</hi>; and ſhe was poſitive, That no People could ride,
more Learnedly, than the <hi>Horſe-women</hi> of our Country. She added, That
little more ſeem'd peculiar, to theſe <hi>Poliſh Diets,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it
were their <hi>Art,</hi> of <hi>Quarrelling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interval</hi>: And, in
that too, ſhe ſaw no Reaſon, why an <hi>Engliſh Woman</hi> might not
equal them.</p>
                  <p> IT was now in a fair Way to be carried on this ſide the

crying out, That ſhe <hi>proteſted</hi> againſt the <hi>Phyſical</hi>
Sound of the Word; for it put her in Mind of her
<hi>Apothecary.</hi>—What at laſt, we all inclin'd to, was the
<hi>Turkiſh Title,</hi> of <hi>DIVAN.</hi> I think, <hi>CONVENTION</hi> was
whiſper'd, faintly; but none of us knew what to make of it: And as for
<hi>CONVOCATION</hi> it was unanimouſly rejected, upon the Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of
a grave <hi>Arch-Deaconeſs,</hi> That it would be inconvenient to aſſume
<hi>known Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> which under Pretence of <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and

            <p>WHEN I was Young, I remember, among many other <hi>Follies,</hi> I
was very vain, and tenacious of my own Way of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I was particularly
delighted with the <hi>Notion</hi> I then had of <hi>Eloquence:</hi> And made
no Manner, of Diſpute, but I was, my ſelf, a wonderful <hi>Proficient</hi>
in it. I was raviſh'd, with the flowing Swell of a long-winded Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. I had
form'd my <hi>Taſte</hi> of <hi>Stile,</hi> upon <hi>Cicero</hi>; and treated
the <hi>Commentaries</hi> of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> with an Extraordinary Air of
Contempt, when I compar'd them with the moſt frothy Flouriſhes of That
ever-abounding <hi>Orator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAD not learnt to conſider, That there is a Difference, in the
Effect of the ſame <hi>Words,</hi> when they are <hi>ſpoke,</hi> and when
they are <hi>written.</hi>—When we <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> a
powerful <hi>Orator,</hi> our Reaſon is betray'd, and <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0199100802:109"/>
dazzled, by the Interpoſition of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.—The Grace, and
Majeſty, of his <hi>Perſon</hi>; The never-reſting Variety of his
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; The Aptneſs of his <hi>Looks,</hi> and <hi>Geſture</hi>;
The Riſe and Fall of his <hi>Voice, inſinuating, ſoftening, accuſing,
repeating, urging, impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> and <hi>enforcing,</hi> with a
<hi>Gradation</hi> of the ſtrongeſt <hi>Paſſions:</hi> All theſe
combine, to charm, and cheat, us, into Admiration.—But, when, diveſted
of theſe Prejudices, we come to <hi>read,</hi> with a ſteady Judgment, what
we <hi>heard,</hi> with ſo much Emotion, the cold, and languid,
<hi>Oratory,</hi> depending now on <hi>Senſe,</hi> and wanting all its Aid of
<hi>Emphaſis,</hi> and <hi>Utterance,</hi> lies taſteleſs on our
Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and <hi>Repetition,</hi> and <hi>Change</hi> of
<hi>Lights,</hi> are found to fill up the Place of <hi>Richneſs,</hi> and
<hi>Variety</hi> in the <hi>Conception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ONE of the firſt, who made me bold enough to break out of my
<hi>Roman Bondage,</hi> and reſolve, for the future, to think, all
<hi>Words,</hi> which give a Diſcourſe no Progreſs in its Meaning, rather
Burdens, than Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery, was <hi>Montaigne,</hi> where he is ſpeaking of
Authors.</p>
            <q>AS to <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſays this free-ſpirited
<hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> to confeſs the <hi>Truth</hi> frankly, His way of
Writing appears to me very tedious. His <hi>Prefaces, Definitions,
Diviſions,</hi> and <hi>Etimolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> take up the greateſt Part of his
<hi>Work.</hi> There is <hi>Life</hi> indeed, and <hi>noble Life!</hi> but it
is ſmother'd in the dreſſing. When I have ſpent an Hour, in reading
him, I recollect <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0199100802:110"/> what <hi>Subſtance</hi> I have
gather'd from him; and find, for the moſt Part, I have got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
<hi>Wind:</hi> He is not, <hi>yet,</hi> come far enough, to be Enter'd upon his
<hi>Reaſons.</hi>—Now, for <hi>Me,</hi> who only deſire to be
<hi>Wiſe,</hi> not <hi>Eloquent,</hi> I wou'd read nothing, but what is to
the <hi>Purpoſe.</hi>—I know well enough, without being told, What is
<hi>meant,</hi> by <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure:</hi> Why then do they
give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Trouble of <hi>Anatomiſing</hi> them? I am for
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Argument,</hi> at the firſt Daſh, and wou'd be
inſtructed how to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> rather than <hi>talk quaintly
of,</hi> my Paſſions. I am for Charging at once, into the Heart of the
Doubt, and not Approaching it, by Way of <hi>Siege,</hi> with Logical
<hi>Lines,</hi> and <hi>Trenches.</hi>—The Subjects of <hi>Cicero</hi>
languiſh, by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying our Expectation. His Way was very well for the
<hi>Bar,</hi>; or might do, perhaps, for the <hi>Pulpit</hi>; and ſince 'tis
ſo common to <hi>Nod,</hi> at a <hi>Sermon,</hi> Men, in this Caſe, might
have Leiſure to <hi>take a Nap,</hi> and wake, a Quarter of an Hour after,
Time enough to find the Thread of the <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi> Men may ſpeak,
in this Manner to <hi>Children,</hi> or to <hi>ignorant People:</hi> But I can
never be made Attentive, by an Author's Elocution, where his <hi>Matter</hi> is
too weak to hold me.</q>
            <p>BEFORE I had the Cood Fortune to meet with this Cenſure, (which
carries with it no more <hi>Boldneſs,</hi> than <hi>Reaſon</hi>) I had
ventur'd to appear, in <hi>Print,</hi> and ſent ſome <hi>Treatiſes</hi>
into the World, which I have never thought <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0199100802:111"/> of, from that
Time forward, without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at my Conſcious Weakneſs, in the
Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of a <hi>Stile,</hi> ſo <hi>Wordy,</hi> that it moves my own
Indignation, very ſtrongly, againſt my ſelf, for what I have, formerly
conſider'd, as no ſmall Part of my <hi>Merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF my <hi>own Works</hi> were of Importance enough, I wou'd
<hi>light 'em up,</hi> as a <hi>Beacon,</hi> to warn Others of the Danger: But,
ſince That <hi>Honour</hi> is more than they deſerve, I diſclaim it, with
due Modeſty; and will borrow an Example, of like Nature, from an Author of
more Dignity.</p>
            <p>THE Gentleman, I mean, is a Reverend and Learned
<hi>Profeſſor:</hi> In whoſe <hi>Preface,</hi> to an excellent
Tranſlation of <hi>Virgil,</hi> we are told, after, at leaſt, as much
<hi>Inſtruction,</hi> as cou'd, <hi>reaſonably,</hi> have been expected,
That <hi>He has, not, yet done with us: For ſomething, more, ſtill,
remains, behind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW, tho' much may be ſaid, for this Gentleman's
<hi>Generoſity,</hi> from the Profuſion of his Deſire to
<hi>ſatisfy</hi> us; yet a leſs Degree of Praiſe will be ſufficient,
for his <hi>Diſcretion:</hi> Since it was not kind enough to whiſper in his
Ear, that He, who tells us the ſame Thing, <hi>Six Times over,</hi> will
rather provoke us to <hi>Indignation</hi> than to <hi>Gratitude</hi>; becauſe
it argues an Opinion in him, That he is talking to Perſons, who have a
<hi>Deafneſs,</hi> in their Underſtanding.—When he had aſſur'd
us, <hi>He had not yet done,</hi> There cou'd be no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World, but
the over-obliging Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0199100802:112"/> of his <hi>Rhetorick,</hi>
to take the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of adding, that <hi>There was ſomething more:</hi> Much
leſs, That there was <hi>ſomething more, ſtill!</hi>—But, when he
goes on, with ſo unhop'd! ſo unexpected! a Flow of Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to add, That
there was <hi>ſomething, more, ſtill, that remain'd,</hi> The Obligation
was <hi>enforc'd</hi> to ſo ſurprizing a Height, that it muſt have been
judg'd Impoſſible to raiſe it more, if we had not found, immediately
after, That not only <hi>ſomething, more, ſtill, remain'd,</hi> but, that
it <hi>remain'd, behind,</hi> alſo!</p>
            <p>I COU'D wiſh to ſee it eſtabliſh'd, as a Rule among
<hi>Writers,</hi> That every Word ſhould be a Fault, which, being taken out
of a <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> left no <hi>Void</hi> in the <hi>Senſe:</hi>
For, to what End ſhou'd we uſe Expreſſions, which may be cut off,
without <hi>Maiming,</hi> or let ſtand, without <hi>Beauty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the Pen of One, who attempts to write <hi>Hiſtory,</hi>
happens to be thus, <hi>dropſically,</hi> diſpoſed, He never fails to
drown his <hi>Facts,</hi> in a Deluge of <hi>Affectation.</hi>—We have
then, long <hi>Speeches</hi> of great Generals, made to their Armies, in Line
of Battle, and juſt on the Point of Engagement; In which the monſtrous
Abſurdity of ſuppoſing ſuch a Time fit for formal Harangues, or that
they could be Audible to the Hundredth Part of the Numbers they are addreſs'd
to, is not ſufficient to deter theſe Orators from diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their
<hi>Tropes,</hi> with ſo much Fullneſs and Variety, that, when the Armies
come to <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0199100802:113"/> 
               <hi>Charge,</hi> the Hiſtorian has not Spirits
enough left him, (after the Fatigue of his <hi>War of Eloquence</hi>) to
obſerve, or explain to us, How the Battle, it ſelf, was formed, and fought;
or by what Conduct, on one ſide, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, on the other, The Fortune of
the Day delcared in Favour of the <hi>Victorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>TACITUS,</hi> of all Hiſtorians, was leaſt guilty of
uſing Wordineſs, or Circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in his Relations.—On the
contrary, when he errs, it is in the much nobler Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, of too Rich, and
Delicate an Exceſs of <hi>Senſe.</hi>—He refines not on
<hi>Words,</hi> but on <hi>Things</hi>; he <hi>ſpeaks</hi> leſs for his
Great Perſons, than They <hi>ſpoke,</hi> for Themſelves: But he
<hi>thinks</hi> for them much more delicately than it is probable <hi>They</hi>
ever thought.—When <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacus,</hi> at the Head of his
<hi>Britons,</hi> is about to charge the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, what Number of
Eloquent Pages could have inſpired his Followers with Reflections, more apt
to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them with Heroick Sentiments, than what He <hi>flaſh</hi>'d upon
their Imaginations, in this comprehenſive Encouragement.—<hi>Fall on,
my Friends, and, in the</hi> Shock, <hi>think of your ANCESTORS, and your
POSTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANTIQUITY can ſcarce produce an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of more
perſwaſive Eloquence, than This <hi>Oration, in a ſingle
Sentence!</hi>—But I have the Pleaſure to ſee, before me, the Speech
of a <hi>Modern Leader,</hi> which, as it had an End very different, ſo its
Influence was <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0199100802:114"/> much more
powerful.—<hi>Caeſar,</hi> and many Generals, before, and after him,
inſpired <hi>faint-hearted Followers, with Courage:</hi> But This is the only
Inſtance, I have ever met with, of a Commander, who had Rhetorick enough to
<hi>talk Brave Fellows, into Cowardice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Hero of our Story (which is, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, a <hi>true</hi>
one) was at his Studies, in One of the Univerſities of a Neighbour-Nation,
when the late Rebellion broke out, and allarmed the Care of the Government. He
was Young, and deſigned for a Pillar of his <hi>Mother Kirk.</hi>—Grace

            <p>AMONG the Beauties of Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there is none, of a nobler
Quality, than the Power of <hi>forgiving Injuries.</hi>—It throws a
Majeſty over the <hi>Mind,</hi> and illuſtrates the <hi>Perſon,</hi> with
an Air of Sweetneſs, and Serenity.—We ought the more to admire it,
ſince, where-ever it is found, It is in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the <hi>Sublimeſt
Virtues:</hi> There not being <hi>Room</hi> for it, in a narrow, vulgar,
<hi>Soul</hi>; becauſe, overfill'd with Little Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch as have
their Riſe, and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, within the Circle of
<hi>Self-Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the Brutal Paſſion of REVENGE, and a malicious Memory, for
<hi>Miſchief,</hi> is become ſo Shameleſs, and Licentious, that it is
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to hear Reſolutions of retain'd Malice avow'd, coldly, and in general
Expreſſions, Such as, <hi>Setting upon People's Skirts,—Finding a
Time to be Even with them,</hi>—and the like malignant, ſilly,
Phraſes, whereby the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0199100802:126"/> of an inward Hatred
ſeem to ſtruggle, for Eruption.</p>
            <p>METHINKS, a ſufficient Fortification, againſt ſo abject a
Frailty, might be drawn from ſuch Natural Reflections, as
Theſe;—That, <hi>In violently returning Wrongs,</hi> we do Nothing but
what <hi>Beaſts</hi> can do, more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.—That, in <hi>Malice,</hi>
the moſt Exalted <hi>Noble,</hi> is but on a Level with the Loweſt
<hi>Slave:</hi> Whereas, to <hi>Pardon,</hi> is an Act of <hi>Sovereignty</hi>;
and, however <hi>Inferior</hi> we were, <hi>before,</hi> to the Perſon, who
has injured us, From the Moment, in which we <hi>forgive him,</hi> we exchange
Conditions, and become <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, ſince many, who have no Ambition to be thought Men of
<hi>Virtue,</hi> would, yet, gladly, be eſteemed <hi>Wiſe,</hi> It may be
an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, of more <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> That This Propenſity to
<hi>Revenge</hi> is a Mark, not of <hi>Mean-Spiritedneſs</hi> only, but of
<hi>Ignorance.</hi>—The Man of Knowledge can never be enough ſurpriz'd,
at Common Wrongs, to be inflam'd into a Reſentment, either too Malicious, or
too Violent.—His Wiſdom has inſtructed him, That where-ever we find
<hi>Men,</hi> we ſhall be ſure to find <hi>Injuries:</hi> And, That there
is a Neceſſity of its being ſo, from the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and oppoſite,
Wills, Humours, and Intereſts, among Mankind.</p>
            <p>SHOU'D the Treacherous, the Suſpicious, the Covetous, the
Inſolent, or the Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, behave themſelves otherwiſe than we 
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0199100802:127"/> could have expected, from their Natures, we might be
juſtified, in our <hi>Wonder</hi> at it.—But, why ſhould we expreſs
Amazement at what it was natural for us to depend on? Why be <hi>Angry</hi>
with the <hi>Inconſiderable?</hi>—Moſt of Thoſe, who provoke, and
offend us, deſerve rather our Grief, and Pity; For They are no more in their
own Hands, than a <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or an <hi>Ideot,</hi> is: And we make a
poorer Figure than our Pride allows us to <hi>believe,</hi> when we diſquiet
our ſelves, on ſuch weak Motives.—When a <hi>Fool</hi> throws a
<hi>Straw</hi> at us, It were to ſeem <hi>light,</hi> to feel the Weight of
it: And <hi>He</hi> will never enjoy <hi>Reſt,</hi> who is not Maſter of
Reſolution to <hi>forgive</hi> All Thoſe Injuries, which his Honour, or his
Safety, does not <hi>compel</hi> him to defend himſelf againſt.</p>
            <p>NEITHER is there only a Wiſdom, and a Nobleneſs;—There
is ſomething, too, of a generous <hi>Courage,</hi> in a Heart, that is above
the Reach of theſe vindictive Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.—The Levity, that is
ſhewn, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved, at every Trifle, carries with it an Air of
Faintneſs, and may be miſtaken for <hi>Puſila<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ity.</hi> For, the firm, and manly,
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, apprehending Nothing, with <hi>Fear,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all Accidents,
with <hi>Calmneſs:</hi> And, juſtly conſcious of its Strength, to
ſupport it ſelf, againſt Danger, is Indifferent to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretions,
or Animoſities, of malignant Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0199100802:128"/>THERE is a ſingle, heroick, <hi>Word,</hi>
in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Adrian,</hi> which I could never
read, without Emotions of the higheſt Admiration; and, which carries in it
the Inſtruction, and Sublimity, of many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes!—After That
Great-Spirited Prince became poſſeſſed of the Empire, He met a
Perſon, in the publick Way, who had been his moſt implacable, and bitter,
Enemy.—The Wretch, whoſe Heart was as <hi>contracted,</hi> as His
Malice had been <hi>extenſive,</hi> began to tremble, with Expectation of
ſome ſevere, and ſudden, Puniſhment,—ſuch as, He knew, He
would, Himſelf, have inflicted on <hi>Adrian,</hi> had the Emperor's Power
been <hi>His.</hi> But <hi>Adrian,</hi> with the ſereneſt Gravity, only
whiſper'd, as He paſs'd him, <hi>EVASISTI—You have Eſcap'd
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL, that <hi>Largeneſs of Soul</hi> could inſpire, or
Eloquence adorn, and utter, ſeems to have been expreſs'd, in this
<hi>ESCAP'D ME!</hi>—It laid open, to the View of the World, the Mighty
Heart of it's Great Speaker!—It declared him nobly ſenſible, That
<hi>Juſtice</hi> would look like <hi>Malice,</hi> ſhould He, now, when at
the Head of Empire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, upon a Private Enemy, the Contempt, He met with,
while a Subject!—That very <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Command of
Puniſhment,</hi> which ſordid Natures would have uſed, with
Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, to the Deſtruction of the Man they hated,
<hi>reſtrained,</hi> and <hi>temper'd,</hi> His Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!—He
conſidered Himſelf, as no longer <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0199100802:129"/> on a <hi>Level</hi>
with his Injurer. The <hi>Protection,</hi> which he owned his <hi>Subject,</hi>
diſarmed the Hatred which he bore his <hi>Enemy!—You have
eſcaped,</hi> (He meant to ſay, in That ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, ſingle, Word!)
<hi>You have eſcaped, by my becoming your MASTER, the Vengeance which you
ſhould have felt, from me, had, I continued, but, your EQUAL.—That</hi>
ADRIAN <hi>is, now, no more, from whom you could not have expected Mercy; And
This</hi> ADRIAN, <hi>who gives you Pardon, owes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to His
offending Subjects, and remembers none of the</hi> Other<hi>'s
Injuries</hi>!</p>
            <p>IT is impoſſible, but a Collection of ſuch amiable Examples
as This, enforced, by ſome perſwaſive Pen, muſt work ſtrongly upon
the Minds of Men, not depraved into utter Taſtleſsneſs: For, by
ſtriking, even, <hi>Little Hearts,</hi> with a clear Conviction, That the
<hi>Precept</hi> contains Nothing, but what has been exceeded in the
<hi>Practice,</hi> It would leave them no Pretence for Evaſion; and
inſinuate, by a gradual Progreſs, out of their Memory, into their
Imitation.</p>
            <p>BUT Nothing furniſhes more Occaſion for Surprize, and
Indignation, than to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Places of Publick Worſhip, filled with
<hi>Outſide Formaliſts,</hi> of all Ranks, and of both Sexes; who, either
with an impious <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> or a <hi>Stupidity,</hi> as dark as
<hi>Ideotiſm,</hi> affront the Majeſty of Heaven, by petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>GOD</hi>'s <hi>Pardon,—as They, Themſelves, pardon Others.</hi>
While, at the very Moment <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0199100802:130"/> of their Kneeling, in this
empty Mockery of Devotion, It is known, to one Half the Congregation, That the
Hearts of the other Half are imbitter'd with malicious Purpoſes, and glowing
with a painful Reſtleſsneſs, till they can be revenged, for, ſome
ſlight Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.—Could Theſe People have a Senſe of the
Signification of the Words they utter, They would tremble at the Apprehenſion
of having What they pray for, <hi>granted, literally</hi>; and the Mercy of
That dreadful GOD they dare to trifle with, <hi>refuſed,</hi> to their
Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, till they have learnt as readily to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,</hi> as to
<hi>pray to be forgiven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, excluſive of thoſe ſeverer Arguments, which might be
drawn from <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> There is <hi>One,</hi> which
<hi>muſt</hi> be welcome; becauſe we, all, agree to <hi>love
ourſelves;</hi> and no Enemy is ſo Troubleſome, as <hi>Malice</hi> to our
<hi>Pride,</hi> our <hi>Health,</hi> and our <hi>Quiet.</hi>—We ſubmit
our ſelves, by this unmanly Paſſion, to the Humours of the Men we
hate.—We empower them to afflict, and mortifie, us.—At the Sight of
a Perſon, againſt whom we meditate Revenge, our Spirits undergo a
Tempeſt: And, even when he is abſent, our Memory goads, and tortures
us.—Our very Dreams become imbitter'd, and confound our <hi>Reſt,</hi>
with our <hi>Diſquiet.</hi>—We wiſh the Evil to Another; but we
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it on our Selves: And, contrary to our own Intention, become
<hi>Patients,</hi> where we deſign to be <hi>Agents.</hi>—The Revenger
lives <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0199100802:131"/> in Torment, and He, on whom He would be revenged,
is at Eaſe.</p>
            <p>IT is a grinding, gnawing, Paſſion, that preys inward, upon
the Heart, and miſtakes the <hi>Means</hi> of its own
<hi>Purpoſe.</hi>—What Triumph can <hi>Revenge</hi> afford us, but from
a Reflexion, That the Perſon puniſhed, repents, and wiſhes the Wrong
unacted? This End can never be obtain'd by <hi>Miſchiefs</hi>; for, by
provoking <hi>new</hi> Malice, they make the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the <hi>old</hi>
delightful: But it may be nobly effected, by aſtoniſhing, diſgracing, and
confounding an Enemy, with <hi>Benefits</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for his
<hi>Demerit.</hi> And This is what the moſt Venerable of all Books very
ſtrongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, by <hi>heaping Coals of Fire, on His Head:</hi> That
is, It burns, and wounds, his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a conſcious Shame, at his
<hi>Inferior Figure,</hi> while He ſees himſelf diſgraced, by Services
from That Perſon, of all the World, whom he leaſt deſerved to be obliged
by!—The ſtubborn Virtue of <hi>CATO,</hi> would have allowed him to
ſubmit to <hi>CAESAR</hi>; but that his <hi>Pride</hi> was more afraid of a
<hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> than his <hi>Perſon</hi> was of an <hi>Inſult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MEN of Spirit ſhou'd <hi>deſpiſe</hi> this Paſſion,
becauſe it is evident, That the <hi>weakeſt</hi> Minds are moſt
malicious, and revengeful.—Children, Women, and Men, leſs reſolute
than Women, ſting, and fret themſelves with ſenſe of Slights,
Contempts, and Follies, which they miſ-call Injuries; while the
<hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> and <hi>Stedfaſt</hi> Mind neglects, or ſmiles 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0199100802:132"/> at, all ſuch Accidents.—Their Effects may

<hi>loſt,</hi> in fruitleſs Murmurings; like a Tempeſt, that is
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd, againſt the Firmneſs of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.—The <hi>Diſtaſts,
Aſperſions,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities,</hi> which appear ſo formidable,
to an Abject Nature, may be compared with Thunder and Lightning; which are
<hi>terrible,</hi> to our <hi>Lower World,</hi> but have nothing in them, worth
the Notice of thoſe Angels, and ſuperior Spirits, which inhabit the
<hi>Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial</hi> Regions.—<hi>SCIPIO, CAESAR, ALEXANDER</hi>; All
the Great and Shining Characters, which have made Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity Illuſtrious,
have been ſo far from ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to indulge <hi>Revenge,</hi> that, on the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they have ſought Occaſions, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm, with <hi>torturing
Kindneſſes,</hi> the moſt malicious, of their Perſonal Enemies.</p>
            <p>BUT, a Mixture of <hi>Shade,</hi> with <hi>Light,</hi> being

            <q> A POET whoſe Name was <hi>Delah,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the Fame of
<hi>Ogtai-Khan</hi>'s Munificence, undertook a Journey, on foot, from the

<hi>China,</hi> for no other Purpoſe, than to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf 
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0199100802:133"/> at the Foot of his Throne, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his
Aſſiſtance, to diſcharge a Debt, of <hi>Five Hundred Baliſches,</hi>
under the Weight of which he became diſpirited, and was interrupted, in his
Studies.—The Generous Prince, converſing with him, and diſcerning his
Extraordinary Merit, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him very graciouſly, and order'd him <hi>a
Thouſand.</hi>—His Chief Miniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, That this was
rather <hi>Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> than <hi>Bounty,</hi> to give <hi>Double</hi> the
Sum demanded!—<hi>Have you not conſider'd,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd Ogtai-Khan,
<hi>That the Poor Man has travell'd over the Mountains, and Deſarts, merely
on the Fame of our Liberality? And, ſhou'd we ſend him back with no more,
than is juſt ſufficient to pay his Debts, by what Means will he be able to
Defray the Charges of his Journey?</hi> But your Highneſs, (anſwer'd the
Miniſter) has not, yet, been inform'd, That he preſum'd to write a
<hi>Satyr,</hi> againſt <hi>ME,</hi> ſince his coming hither, becauſe I
was unwilling to allow him Acceſs, with ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent a
Petition!—<hi>For which Reaſon,</hi> reply'd the Prince) <hi>You
ſhall preſent him with another Thouſand</hi> out of your own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Purſe, <hi>That he may go back, and tell his Countrymen, there is a Monarch,
in this part of the World, who permits not his MINISTERS's RESENTMENTS to be
the Meaſures of his Bounty.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0199100802:134"/>JUST half as good a Story we read, of
<hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>our Spencer</hi>; She had order'd him a
<hi>Hundred Marks,</hi> for ſome Piece of his Poetry: But the Frugal
<hi>Treaſurer,</hi> of thoſe Days, whoſe <hi>Wit</hi> was too Little, for

               <hi>MAHOMET</hi> the IId, That victorious <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Emperor, who took <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from the Chriſtians, had a very
great Genius for Poetry, and was ſo warm in its Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that He is
reported to have offer'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for every <hi>Fault,</hi> that cou'd be
pointed out, in the Works of his <hi>Court Poets,</hi> and made Good againſt
the Arguments, which ſhou'd be brought, in Favour of the Defendants.</p>
            <p>HEAVEN be prais'd, That His Majeſty of <hi>GREAT BRITAIN</hi>
has no ſuch partial Opinion of the Poets of our Age, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try! Such a
Proclamation wou'd drain his Exchequer, more effectually than a Ten Years
<hi>War,</hi> with the ſtrongeſt Power of <hi>Europe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, I believe, we may live at Eaſe: The Encouragement of the
Poet's Art, in this preſent Generation, will occaſion no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs,
that can be dangerous to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0199100802:136"/> And, as for our
<hi>Great Men,</hi> They are <hi>Patrons,</hi> for the moſt Part, as They are
<hi>Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Maſters of Art,</hi> rather by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than by
Purpoſe; and think themſelves under no Obligation to <hi>pay for</hi>
Compliments which their Conſcience tells them, They have <hi>No Right
to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Truth is, when Any Thing, ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, falls out, as,
That A Man of Quality is Witty Himſelf, and an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of Wit, in Others;
The Poets are ſo Unmerciful, in their Aſſaults on his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, That
His Equals, in Dignity, have found much Safety and Comfort, in the Fame of
<hi>Dullneſs.</hi> And there never was a livelier Proof of the Soundneſs of
That Common Maxim, that <hi>Honeſty is the beſt Policy</hi>; than the
Succeſs of the faſhionable Expedient, (at once ſo frank, and ſo
ingenious!) of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dedicator's Gilt Book, with this ſhort Apology
for not accepting it—<hi>My Lord gives his Service, and ſays, He does
not UNDERSTAND theſe Matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR Want of ſome ſuch dext'rous <hi>Stroke of Art,</hi> The
Grandees, of That <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor's Court, whom I nam'd, at the Head
of my Paper, were, often, reduc'd to a <hi>Nonplus.</hi> It was, particularly,
the Caſe of <hi>Ali-Baſha,</hi> His Favourite <hi>Treaſurer.</hi> He had
learnt to <hi>Read,</hi> and <hi>caſt Accompts</hi>; But <hi>Wit</hi> being
<hi>out of his Way,</hi> He had one, regular, Method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding All who
addreſs'd their Writings to Him: He put the Book into one Scale, and 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0199100802:137"/> dropt Gold into another, and, having <hi>adjuſted the
Balance,</hi> gave the <hi>Weight</hi> of the Work, as a Gratuity, to the
Author.—The worſt Effect of this General Rule was, That it was common
for the <hi>lighteſt Diſcourſes</hi> to bring with them the
<hi>heavieſt Bindings.</hi> There was nothing, more <hi>Subſtantial</hi>
than the <hi>Covers</hi> of this Great Patron's Books!—But one Poet,
above the Reſt, had contriv'd a pleaſant Scheme, to make the moſt of his
Ingenuity. He compos'd a Copy of Verſes; and, inſtead of <hi>Writing</hi>
them, in the uſual Manner, caus'd them to be <hi>Engrav'd</hi> on a Block of
<hi>Marble,</hi> that was large enough for a <hi>Tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone!</hi>—He
loaded a Cart with his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and went to wait on the Baſha with it;
who, having Notice of his intended Preſent, ſent out the Maſter of his
Buildings, to examine the Size, and Workmanſhip, of the Stone, and pay for
it, according to its Value—The Poet went away very much ſurpriz'd, and
diſſatisfy'd, and writ his Patron a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, How contrary to His
<hi>Greatneſs</hi>'s Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, His Officers had preſum'd to Treat him: To
which the <hi>Baſha</hi> anſwer'd, gravely, That <hi>it aroſe, from a
Change, in His Manner;—For, whereas he had, formerly, reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by
WEIGHT, He ſhou'd, hereafter, do it, by MEASURE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have <hi>ſome,</hi> among our Nobility, who are equally
Illuſtrious for their <hi>Learning,</hi> and their <hi>Patronage</hi> of
Learning: But they are ſo <hi>Poetically perſecuted,</hi> by the Swarms of
Little <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0199100802:138"/> Creatures, who have no End, in Writing, but the
Profit they propoſe to draw from it, That they meet with daily Provocations
to repel the Avarice of Flattery, with a Spirit, and Sharpneſs, like the
<hi>Baſha's,</hi> above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd: And, This, no Doubt, is one Reaſon for
the Neglect, which <hi>Works of Genius</hi> often meet with, when addreſs'd
to Men of Quality.</p>
            <p>BUT, if Contempt is due to the <hi>Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> The
<hi>Modeſt</hi> deſerve Encouragement: And They, who are truly Generous,
ſhou'd never wait, till Occaſion offers it ſelf; but ſeek, and make,
the Opportunity. For, as the Sharpneſs of our <hi>Sight</hi> is beſt prov'd
by the <hi>Remoteneſs,</hi> in which we diſtinguiſh Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; ſo our
<hi>Judgment</hi> appears, moſt ſtrongly, when we diſcern Merit at
<hi>Diſtance,</hi> and <hi>invite</hi> it, to aproach us.</p>
            <p>I AM always pleas'd with the Proſpect of Any Work, from which
the <hi>Publick</hi> may promiſe It ſelf, either Entertainment, or
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: And I hope, The Gentleman, who has ſent me the following

becauſe the Book, in itſelf, has a very uncommon Merit: And Both
<hi>Merit,</hi> and <hi>Ill-Fortune,</hi> join, to recommend the
Propoſer.</p>
            <p>I THINK it was finely ſaid, by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe Writings,
and Humanity, were, for many Years, the Admiration of the
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.—<hi>That it ought to be the Care of All, in whoſe Power it
lay, to lift Mr.</hi> SAVAGE <hi>above a Senſe of his</hi> MOTHER<hi>'s
Cruelty; becauſe a Miſery, ſo undeſerved, had intitled him to a Right
of finding Every Good Man his</hi> FATHER.</p>
            <p>BUT, when, to a <hi>Miſery ſo undeſerved,</hi> we add a
<hi>Deſign, ſo full of Reaſon,</hi> It is impoſſible, but there
muſt be <hi>Many,</hi> who will feel a noble Delight, in diſtinguiſhing
their Zeal, for ſo modeſt a Propoſer; and ſend their own Names, and
Thoſe of Others, whom they can Influence, as ſo many <hi>Examples,</hi>
when the <hi>Liſt</hi> comes to be publiſh'd, That we have Spirits, who can
diſcover <hi>Genius,</hi> before it riſes into <hi>Noiſe</hi>: and dare
promote it, without <hi>waiting</hi> till the <hi>Way has been led, by
Others.</hi>

            <p>MY Devotion, I am afraid, is not ſo <hi>Pure,</hi> and
<hi>Simple,</hi> as it ought to be. There is a <hi>Niceneſs,</hi> in my
Taſte of other People's Behaviour, at Church, which ill agrees with the Duty,
which I my ſelf am there, for the Diſcharge of.</p>
            <p>I diſcovered this Defect of <hi>Grace</hi> in the Conſtitution
of my Zeal, by a kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate <hi>Contempt,</hi> which I found my ſelf
affected by, laſt <hi>Sunday,</hi> againſt that plain, and humble,
Aukwardneſs, with which the mangled <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> were
vociferated, by the Congregation.—A Gentleman, of my Acquaintance,
unluckily whiſpered me, (in the midſt of what they call their
<hi>Singing</hi>) That he knew a <hi>Dutch</hi> Painter, who had drawn the
livelieſt <hi>Groteſque</hi> Piece, in <hi>Europe,</hi> by an Idea, that he
brought out of Church <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0199100802:144"/> with him, from a Gallery of
<hi>Country Pſalms-Singers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY Eyes, and Ears, took his Hint; and I ſhall never forget the
<hi>Group</hi> of Living Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery!—The Rolling Eyes, Raiſed Faces,
Hanging Heads, Oblique Chins, Stretch'd Mouths, and Diſtorted
Muſcles!—The <hi>Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> too were as provokingly diſſonant, as
the <hi>Looks</hi> were ludicrouſly penitential!—Inſtead of finding
my Thoughts exalted, by the Spirit of tranſporting <hi>Harmony,</hi> I became
<hi>aſhamed,</hi> at the preſumptuous Licenſe, with which the
Coarſeſt, and moſt unskilful <hi>Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> took upon 'em to <hi>bear
Part,</hi> in Muſick, Sacred to the Praiſes of the ALMIGHTY.</p>
            <p>THIS brought to my Reflection, with how much Reaſon, as well as
Reverence, The <hi>Choirs</hi> of our <hi>Cathedral</hi> Churches preſerve
the Dignity of their Religious Harmony, by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Unskill'd</hi>;
and aiding the Attracted Heart, by all the ſweet, and melting Force, of Vocal
and of Inſtrumental Muſick; in its moſt moving Elegance, and
Perfection.</p>
            <p>BUT, It is not only the Manner in which <hi>Pſalms</hi> are
commonly ſung, that I conſider as an Indecency: The <hi>Pſalms
Themſelves,</hi> as we have them in the old <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Verſion,
are a Diſgrace to our our Learning, Language, and our
Religion!—<hi>Who,</hi> that forms his Notion of <hi>David</hi>'s Genius,
from his Poetry, as This Tranſlation gives it us, could poſſibly
<hi>believe</hi> Him the Sublimeſt, of All Human Writers? Who, that ſhould
read theſe Lines, as they run, in the Exalted Original?</p>

            </p>
            <p>THERE is Nothing ſo Rapturous! No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſtrongly painted,

which have immortalized the Antient Poets, as moſt of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Deſcriptions of the Power, and Majeſty of GOD! And, among Theſe, The

Collection, in one View, of the moſt <hi>Dreadful</hi> and <hi>Amiable,</hi>
of the Almighty's Attributes: So glowingly conceived, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in
ſuch lively Fullneſs; that all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin ODES,</hi>
are faint, and languid, in Compariſon with it.</p>
            <p>IT is impoſſible to <hi>Tranſlate</hi> the Images of This
prodigious Poet, without doing them ſome Injuſtice: But, having lately been
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with an Eſſay, upon the mentioned <hi>Pſalm,</hi> in which

            <p>I DECLAR'D, in a late Paper, that my Speculations ſhou'd
ſometimes, extend to <hi>Politicks.</hi> This Day's Entertainment ſhall be
an Introduction, to that Purpoſe; which I ſhall, occaſionally, purſue,
with the open Spirit of a PLAIN DEALER: aſſerting, and making free with All
the <hi>Liberty</hi> I was <hi>born to:</hi>—A Liberty, which does not
alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title us to a Property in our <hi>Eſtates,</hi> but in our
<hi>Thoughts</hi> alſo. It is the great Charecte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick of every Free-born
<hi>Briton,</hi> That <hi>He may ſpeak, as He thinks, and think, as He
pleaſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHILE, like the Provinces of the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Empire of <hi>Old
Rome,</hi> we are fretting, and diſturbing ourſelves, (under the Notion of
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Principle)</hi> to ſupport the factious Avarice of
a few aſpiring Men, who find their Intereſt in our Diviſions, the
<hi>GOTHS are at</hi> 
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0199100802:151"/> 
               <hi>our Gate</hi>; and we are
apprehenſive of no <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Danger.—There ſeems to be
riſing, near us, That NORTHERN LYON, which has, ſo often, been propheſied
of: And I believe, in the Courſe of my Papers, I ſhall make it
ſufficiently viſible, that, if early Meaſures are not taken, by Way of
<hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> againſt the threaten'd Evil, the UNIVERSAL EMPIRE,
which <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> have ſucceſſively alarm'd
<hi>Europe</hi> with a fruitleſs Dread of, ſeems, in Reality, to be coming
upon us, with all the Terrors of a <hi>Fifth General Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF it is ſuppos'd, That ſuch a Fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>Us,</hi>
leſs than <hi>other States,</hi> which may be thought to lie more expos'd, I
doubt we deceive Our-ſelves, by a Vanity, common to all Nations, in
over-rating the <hi>Hazard</hi> of an Enemy, who ſhou'd preſume to invade
us.—Our <hi>Ships,</hi> (powerful, and numerous, as they are) are more
formidable by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their Terror, than by the Danger of their
Oppoſition. For, to expect that a <hi>Fleet</hi> will, at all Times, be able
to keep Danger at a Diſtance, were to give our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> to the
<hi>Winds</hi>—How many <hi>Caveats,</hi> againſt ſo unſtable a
Security, cannot our own Hiſtory furniſh us with?—Neither ought it to
be conſider'd, as a Remote, or Chimerical, Proſpect, <hi>That we may be
match'd in our Marine Pretenſions</hi>—We cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have
more Advantage, in the Fame, and Practice, of Dominion at Sea, againſt 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0199100802:152"/> any of our Cotemporary States, than the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> had againſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> And the Succeſs
which crown'd the Induſtry, and unconquerable Spirit, of theſe Laſt, in
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of <hi>all</hi> Obſtacles, as well of <hi>Nature,</hi> as of
<hi>Art,</hi> is a Leſſon, which may may teach our Stateſmen, That there
is infinite Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, between Things <hi>difficult,</hi> and Things
<hi>impoſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOT to inſiſt on, the memorable Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, with which
<hi>France,</hi> in a few Years Application, convinc'd us, with how little
Reaſon we had indulg'd a Notion, <hi>That there were natural
Impoſſibilities to prevent that Great Nation from becoming Powerful, at
Sea;</hi> All which were found mere Shadows, when the Genius of her Miniſters
turn'd their Thoughts on attempting it!—The prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and
enterprizing, Spirit of the preſent <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> has,
at once, eſtabliſh'd, in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> a Third <hi>Maritime</hi>
Power, Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Both its old Ones: And, now, while I am Writing, has a
Fleet of Sixty <hi>Ships of the Line,</hi> beſides
<hi>Frigates</hi>;—and <hi>Gallies</hi> without Number.</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>natural</hi> Advantages, whether for <hi>building,
equipping,</hi> or <hi>maintaining</hi> a Navy, this Prince has the Start of
us, beyond all Compariſon.—And ſince, when his Ships are as
<hi>Many,</hi> and as <hi>Strong,</hi> as ours, (which judging by what has been
done already, they may be, in Three or Four Years) our whole Pretence to
Superiority muſt be plac'd in our <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0199100802:153"/> 
               <hi>Skill,</hi> and
<hi>Experience,</hi> in Sea-Fights, how dangerous wou'd the Conſequence be
found, ſhou'd he hit upon ſome New Method of <hi>improving his Veſſels,
in their Strength, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, or Offenſive?</hi> Many High, and Ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Attempts toward which, have buſied, ſome Years paſt, the unreſting
Genius of that Monarch.</p>
            <p>WITHIN the Memory of Numbers, yet living, the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> were conſider'd, as a People, ſo far from
<hi>Dangerous,</hi> that they were even <hi>Contemptible:</hi> And the
precipitate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of their Reputation in Arms, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, is a Proof, that
no Vanity is more weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded, and unjuſt, than the Common Practice of
all Nations, to eſteem <hi>Themſelves</hi> more <hi>Valiant</hi> than their
<hi>Neighbours.</hi>—Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is every where the <hi>ſame,</hi> by
Nature, till a <hi>Difference</hi> is produc'd, by Cuſtom.—What Nation
<hi>braver,</hi> than the <hi>Perſians</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Cyrus?</hi> Yet, what
Nation <hi>baſer,</hi> when they oppos'd the Arms of
<hi>Alexander?</hi>—What People, under Heaven, have more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd the
Hiſtories of former Ages, than the Anceſtors of thoſe degenerate
<hi>Greeks,</hi> who are, now, the Diſgrace of <hi>Chriſtendom? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Slaves,</hi> under a Tyranny, a thouſand Times more inſupportable than the
worſt of Thoſe, in ſcorn of which their ancient Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have fill'd the
World with Noiſy Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, in the boaſted Cauſe of <hi>Liberty!
ITALY,</hi> the imperious Miſtreſs of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe! has been
<hi>ſunk,</hi> for many Ages; and <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0199100802:154"/> parcell'd into
petty, and almoſt inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Juriſdictions!</hi>—And, to
bring the Proof quite <hi>Home,</hi> what People ever ſeem'd to hold a
clearer Superiority over their Enemies, than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armies,
which our <hi>Firſt Edward,</hi> led to War againſt the <hi>Scots?</hi>
And, yet, what Truth more undeniable, than the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Cowardice,</hi>
and downright <hi>Baſeneſs,</hi> of the Sons of thoſe very
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> drawn out, againſt the Sons of the ſame <hi>Scots,</hi>
in the next ſucceeding Reign of <hi>Edward the Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>COURAGE, when conſider'd <hi>nationally,</hi> is not the Effect
of <hi>Nature,</hi> but of <hi>Diſcipline!</hi> Skill, and Practice, teaching
an Agility in the Uſe of Arms, excite a Pleaſure in their Exerciſe: And,
abating, by Degrees, that Fear of Death, which is natural to all Men, convert
it into Hope of Victory; and a proud, and reſtleſs, Thirſt of
Glory.—<hi>Arms</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and a dexterous Superiority in the Uſe
of them, ſhould be eſteemed the <hi>Sinews of War</hi>; and not MONEY, as
is, commonly, pretended.—An Army, capable of <hi>conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> will
always find Means of <hi>ſubſiſting:</hi> But <hi>Money,</hi> though it
<hi>ſubſiſts</hi> an ill-diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Army, can never qualifie it for
<hi>conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>—The Helpleſs <hi>Indians,</hi> of
<hi>Mexico,</hi> were infinitely <hi>Richer,</hi> than their
Plunderers,—the <hi>Goths,</hi> when (from that very Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which the
<hi>Czar</hi> now governs) they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, and ruin'd <hi>Europe,</hi> brought
them only, <hi>Iron</hi>; they knew, <hi>That</hi> would make them Maſters of
all the <hi>Gold,</hi> they ſhould have Occaſion for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0199100802:155"/>PRINCES, whoſe Authority is abſolute,
and uncontroll'd, by <hi>Privileges, Rights,</hi> or <hi>Cuſtoms</hi>;
whoſe Dominions are vaſt, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, and whoſe Subjects are
laborious, hardy, and obedient; and acquainted with no <hi>Learning,</hi> but
what is ſufficient to aid their Induſtry, without inflaming their
Pride.—Such Princes, become <hi>dreadful,</hi> as ſoon as they appear
<hi>ambitious,</hi> and exert themſelves in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for
<hi>War.</hi>—But, when it happens, too, that a Prince, in ſo tempting
a Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has a Genius capable of <hi>Improving</hi> the Art-Military, It
is difficult to put <hi>Limits</hi> to the Conſequences, which may attend His
Fortune.</p>
            <p>THO' the Study of the <hi>Art of War</hi> has been carried to a
great Perfection, yet there is Room enough left to give Scope to the Force of
Genius, this Way: And it would, perhaps, be found, upon Trial, That the
<hi>Modern Syſtem,</hi> (notwithſtanding the Uſe of <hi>Gunpowder,</hi>
which was unknown to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients) is as ſubject as the <hi>old</hi> was, to
be trampled on, and overpower'd, by ſome new, and unforeſeen,
<hi>Diſcoveries,</hi> on thoſe Sides, moſt eſpecially, where we believe
ourſelves ſecureſt.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>meaſur'd Lines</hi> of Humane Foreſight, which are,
ſo proudly diſtinguiſhed, by the Name of <hi>Policy,</hi> are vain
Amuſements, and mere <hi>Cobweb Subtleties.</hi>—Their narrow, buſy,
Schemes, of <hi>balancing</hi> the Power, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Nations, are
often inſufficient for the <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0199100802:156"/> Purpoſes of their
Deſigners, becauſe theſe High-way Stateſmen <hi>found</hi> their Maxims
upon <hi>Error, in the firſt Concoction.</hi>—The <hi>Force</hi> of a
Prince is, by their Rule, to be calculated, from his <hi>Revenue,</hi> and his
<hi>Revenue,</hi> from the Wealth of his Subjects: But This Argument depends
intirely on the general, <hi>miſtaken,</hi> Notion, <hi>That All Equal
Numbers, will be of Equal Weight, in War</hi>; which is ſo far from being
<hi>true,</hi> That, ſhould the <hi>Pooreſt</hi> Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi>
fall upon the <hi>Richeſt,</hi> with a Skill in Arms, as much Superiour, as
He is <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> in his Numbers, the Diſparity would be
<hi>revers'd,</hi> immediately.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Romans,</hi> who never <hi>conquer'd, in order to prolong
a War,</hi> but to make it bear its own Expences; and encreaſe, as well their
<hi>Treaſury,</hi> as their <hi>Reputation,</hi> were ſo far from this new
Way, of computing an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's <hi>Strength,</hi> by his <hi>Riches,</hi> that
Their Judgment was directly contrary. And this Opinion of Ancient Times appears
ſtrongly in that magnanimous Anſwer, which was given by a <hi>Gaul,</hi> to
a King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who ſhew'd him his Heaps of <hi>Gold,</hi> in
order to excite Terror; and, then, ask'd him, <hi>What He thought of His
Condition?</hi> The rugged Soldier reply'd, ſharply, <hi>That as to what
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd His Condition, a Stranger could be no Judge: But His</hi> BOUNTY,
<hi>He could perceive, Extraordinary,—ſince he had taken ſuch
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Pains to let his Enemies be convinc'd, clearly, That his Kingdom was
worth their Conquering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0199100802:157"/>WHERE a Prince is really
<hi>ſtrong,</hi>—To be held <hi>Weak,</hi> in the Opinion of the World,
is rather a Benefit, than a Diſadvantage.—His Preparations alarm no
Body; and the Blow, he deſigns to ſtrike, will as ſoon be <hi>felt,</hi>
as <hi>apprehended:</hi> Whereas the Fame of Power, and Riches keeps Jealouſy
awake; and attracts Envy, and Oppoſition, from all Quarters.—The
<hi>Fortune</hi> of the late <hi>French</hi> King had, poſſibly, kept Pace
with his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> if it had not been watch'd, and check'd, upon this
ſingle Conſideration.—On the other Hand, <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi>
was ſo happily <hi>deſpis'd,</hi> by the <hi>Auſtrian Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,</hi>
which took it for granted, according to the modern Reaſoning, <hi>That the
Poverty of ſuch an Invader would be a Curb to his Courage,</hi> that, boldly
entring <hi>Germany</hi> with an Army of but <hi>Seven Thouſand Men,</hi> he
carried every Thing before him, like a Torrent; broke the whole Scheme of the
Emperor's Deſigns; and had ruin'd, in all Likelyhood, the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of that
Family, if he had not been <hi>kill'd,</hi> in the Battle of

            <p>DESIGNING, in ſome future <hi>Papers,</hi> to ſpeak of Things,
a little out of the common Road, and draw Concluſions, which I judge too
<hi>new,</hi> to venture on, without a previous Notice, That I propoſe not to
deduce my Arguments from the Principles of <hi>Modern Politiques,</hi> and
therefore refuſe to be try'd by them; I have, for that Reaſon, thought
neceſſary to publiſh theſe few General Reflections, as a Preparative,
for what I intend, hereafter, to conſider, in a more diſtinct, and
peculiar, Manner.</p>

            <p>THE Sable <hi>Toaſts</hi> of thoſe Sunny Climates have ſuch
<hi>Choice</hi> of Tempting Privileges, that I ſhall have Room, in this
Paper, to recommend but a very few of them: I will, therefore, ſelect the
Beſt; and begin with this ARCH-CLAIM of <hi>Virginity, within the
Tropicks,</hi> that Girls, at Nine Years old, commence <hi>Women!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Young Ladies,</hi> too, in moſt Places, are at Liberty
to diſpoſe, freely, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be call'd <hi>Their own:</hi> And,
when, afterwards, they think of <hi>Marrying, their</hi> 
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0199100802:162"/>
               <hi>Credit,</hi> like that of other Traders, is rated the <hi>higher,</hi> by
how much <hi>wider,</hi> and more <hi>publickly,</hi> They have carried on
their <hi>Dealing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I THINK, no Doubt can ariſe, concerning the Welcome with which
<hi>Theſe Two valuable RIGHTS</hi> will be receiv'd: But, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>altogether ſo clear,</hi> in my Opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the
<hi>following,</hi> I ſhall leave it to be weigh'd, maturely, How, far it may
be <hi>of Uſe AMONG US,</hi> it is a <hi>Privilege to retire, from the
Fatigue of Man's Society, after having been Mothers of Ten Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Antient <hi>Tryal, by bitter Waters,</hi> has been more
generally heard of, than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, among our <hi>Women</hi> here at home, who,
if not, perhaps, the <hi>Deepeſt,</hi> are, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably, the
<hi>prettieſt Caſuiſts,</hi> in the Univerſe. But the Duskier Beauties,
of <hi>Negroland,</hi> when under Accuſations of <hi>too much good
Nature,</hi> have an Appeal, to <hi>ſweeter Waters,</hi> in Juſtification
of their Innocence: For, in order to diſcover, to a jealous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whether
the Wife has been guilty, or not, ſhe is thrown, headlong, into a River: And
if ſhe <hi>drowns,</hi> ſhe was a <hi>Sinner.</hi> But, it is a Remark, of
great Conſolation, That there never was found a <hi>Woman,</hi> who had not
<hi>Lightneſs enough to Swim</hi>; and eſcape the Malice of her
Accuſers.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſomething, too, in their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Manner of
<hi>Mourning, for the Death of a Husband,</hi> which deſerves to be offer'd
to the Conſideration of the SEX, in theſe more <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0199100802:163"/>
               <hi>Phlegmatick, Northern,</hi> Regions: And one wou'd wonder, indeed, how any
thing, <hi>ſo extravagantly Polite,</hi> ſhou'd have got Footing, among
People, who never Subſcrib'd, to an <hi>Opera.</hi>—The whole Term of
ſuch <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is included within <hi>Fourteen Days:</hi> And the
Ceremony conſiſts of <hi>Cries,</hi> which are modulated by the Tunes of
Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and accommodated (with a certain Equitable Dexterity)
to the Eaſe of the <hi>Performer,</hi> and more lively Entertainment of the
<hi>Audience</hi>; by large, intermediate, <hi>Pauſes,</hi> during which they
drink Brandy, and ſmoke Tobacco, 'till their <hi>Spirits</hi> are duly
rais'd, to expect when the Muſick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins again, for <hi>another Act,</hi> of
the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, above all their agreeable Cuſtoms, I contemplate, with
moſt Reverence, the vaſt Extent of their <hi>Charity!</hi> There is, in it,
an uncommon Profoundneſs; and a Tenderneſs of Heart, beyond
Example!—It is a Practice, among the <hi>Rich Negro Ladies,</hi> on the
<hi>Gold Coaſt,</hi> to give Orders, on their Death Beds, for buying up a
Number of Female-Slaves, to beſtow on the <hi>Publick,</hi> as <hi>Living
Legacies,</hi> whoſe whole Buſineſs it is, to be at Every Body's
Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>in One ſole Employment,</hi> (which they are, All, equally,
capable of) for the Price of <hi>Three Periwincle-Shells.</hi>—They
conſider This, as a Work, of great Mercy, and Compaſſion; and,
conſcious of their <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0199100802:164"/> pious Purpoſe, cloſe their
Eyes, and die, ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>I COU'D add an infinite Variety of ſuch uncommon Commodities as
Theſe: But the Foregoing will ſerve, as <hi>Samples,</hi> of what <hi>Rich
Goods</hi> may be imported, for the Uſes, which my Correſpondent hints at,
if, in Right of her ſelf, and the <hi>Ladies</hi> ſhe acts for, ſhe cou'd
propoſe any <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Engraftment,</hi> by vertue whereof, the
<hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> of the <hi>Royal Company</hi> might co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with
the <hi>Siſterhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is not to be queſtion'd, but, when ſuch a Scheme comes to
be ſeen, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of ſome other, of our more thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Societies</hi> will <hi>ſtir</hi> againſt it, out of Envy, and
propoſe their <hi>own</hi> reſpective <hi>Bodies,</hi> as moſt Capable
of, or more adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, the mention'd <hi>Incorporation.</hi> But the Ladies
will, I hope, have Honour enough to <hi>keep cloſe</hi> to their firſt
Engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And, leaſt their natural Diſpoſition <hi>to think too meanly
of Themſelves, and their own Reaſonings,</hi> ſhould expoſe them,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Defence, to the Force of Arguments, they cannot Anſwer, I will
conclude this Eſſay for their Service with the Example of a ROYAL AFRICAN;
<hi>His Majeſty, the King of</hi> Boffoe; who, when his <hi>Conſcience</hi>

            <p>I REMEMBER a Paſſage, in ſome <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Writer,
which carries a ſharp, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, Moral. An <hi>Emir,</hi> of great
Sanctity, had a Cuſtom, every Night, to call his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily together, that they
might ſit round him, with due Gravity, to hear his Son read ſome Chapter of
the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would take Pleaſure in opening, and
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging on, to his Domeſtick Congregation. It happened, one Night, that,
in the midſt of the Sermon, the whole Audience <hi>fell aſleep</hi>; except
the Preacher, and his Son: Which laſt, aſſoon as he obſerv'd it,
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his Father, with this Remark.—<hi>See, Sir, the Fruits of
your Good Purpoſe! There is not one, of them All, but ſleeps, as ſoundly,
as if God's Word deſerv'd no Reverence!</hi>—The <hi>Emir</hi> look'd
round the Company, and ſhutting up his <hi>Spectacles,</hi> in the Book,
againſt a fitter Opportunity, drew his Diſcourſe to a 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0199100802:167"/> Concluſion, with this Reply, to his Son's
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence—<hi>You had, your ſelf, been better employ'd, in adding
One to the Number of Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, than in waking, not ſo much to correct your
own Faults, as to obſerve the Faults of Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I receiv'd a Letter, the other Day, which brought this Story to my
Remembrance, and is one Proof, among many, how difficult a Province he
undertakes, who aſſumes the Office of a PLAIN DEALER, at a Time, when
People are ſo <hi>vigorous,</hi> in the Cenſures, which they make
<hi>Themſelves</hi>; and ſo <hi>languid,</hi> in their Approbation of
Thoſe, which others make, with the ſame Liberty!</p>
            <p>The Author of this Letter is, ſo kind, as to let me know, 
<q rend="inline">"He is one of my <hi>Beſt Friends</hi>; he will
not therefore inſiſt on my Diſingenuity, to <hi>fall foul of</hi>—a
ſingle Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,—in one of my late Papers; and, <hi>dwell on one
Error,</hi> in a voluminous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: But he is ſo good as to be in Pain for
my <hi>Veracity</hi>; having carefully (he ſays) examin'd every ſingle
Paragraph of <hi>Mr.</hi> Trapp's <hi>Preface to his Tranſlation of</hi>
Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, and not being able to diſcover, what I charge him with.—He
cloſes all, with a Hint, that he writes, in Vindication of that worthy and
Reverend, Author; and would not have Offence taken <hi>at every
Trifle.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE VERACITY of the PLAIN DEALER being the Side he will be ſure 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0199100802:168"/> to be moſt defenſible on, it was unskilfully done,
for a <hi>Lover of the Muſes,</hi> as my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent ſubſcribes
himſelf, to bring on his Attack, ſo raſhly, on that Quarter.—He
ought, firſt, to have been very careful, and confirm'd, in his
<hi>Diſcoveries.</hi>—But, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the <hi>Cloud</hi> from his
Sight, if he pleaſes to turn to <hi>Page</hi> 382, of the firſt Volume of
the mention'd Tranſlation; in an <hi>Eſſay, on moving the
Paſſions,</hi> previous to the Remarks on the 4th Book, he will find a
Paragraph ended thus,—<hi>We have
not—as—yet—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed—completed the Explication,
propos'd:—For
ſomething—more—ſtill—remains—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</hi>—If
this differs from what it appear'd in my Paper, it is only by being a little
<hi>worſe</hi> than I made it.</p>
            <p>THUS much, to the <hi>Charge,</hi> in that only Part, which
carried any <hi>Appearance</hi> of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with it.—The other Articles
have no Weight, at all, but from the Regard that is due to a <hi>miſtaken
Good-Nature;</hi> which has miſled the Gentleman, whoever he was, to
apprehend, as a <hi>Trifle,</hi> an Error of the firſt Magnitude, in
Writing.—It is certainly the Buſineſs, and the <hi>Aim,</hi> of every
Author, to <hi>explain,</hi> and <hi>illuſtrate,</hi> his Argument: But this
tedious Redundance obſcures, and perplexes it.—Where a Man ſhould
<hi>imprint</hi> Idea's, he diſtracts and <hi>erazes</hi> them: And,
inſtead of awakening the Paſſions, affects the Spirits with
Drowſineſs.—Such a <hi>TRIFLE</hi> is this Fault, which my
Correſpondent is for <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0199100802:169"/> paſſing over, with ſo
tender-hearted a Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</p>
            <p>THE cenſur'd Paſſage, then, is no Error, of ſuch
<hi>ſmall Importance,</hi> as the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had thought fit to imagine;
but he falls, next, into another Miſtake, of conſidering it, as a Place,
pick'd out by the Inquiſition of a malicious Eye: Whereas (if he had been as
attentive to the <hi>Argument,</hi> of the Paper, where he found that
Cenſure, as he was to the <hi>Cenſure Itſelf</hi>) nothing would have
been more eaſy, than to have obſerv'd <hi>Numbers, of the ſame Kind</hi>
of <hi>Amplifications,</hi> which might, with equal Effect, have been borrow'd
from that work: And, thence, he muſt have drawn this natural and obvious
Concluſion.—That <hi>one Error, only, was dwelt on,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was all that could be found, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was all, that could be
admitted in that Paper.</p>
            <p>AS to the <hi>Worthineſs,</hi> or <hi>Reverence,</hi> of the
Author, the Letter-Writer himſelf can wiſh no leſs Ill to him, than the
PLAIN DEALER does. But this is a Matter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of the Queſtion. The
<hi>Perſon</hi> has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, where what he has <hi>written,</hi> and
<hi>publiſhed,</hi> is the Ground of the Argument.—For a
<hi>Friend,</hi> Partiality is <hi>Weakneſs</hi>: And, againſt an
<hi>Enemy,</hi> it is <hi>Baſeneſs.</hi> The Merit of a Cauſe lies above
the Level of ſuch low Motives; and they, who would reach it, as they ought,
muſt be liſted in their Attempt, between <hi>Juſtice</hi> and
<hi>Reſolution.</hi>—There is <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0199100802:170"/> nothing, which the
PLAIN DEALER has a ſincerer Deteſtation of, than Perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or
Defamation: But then, on the other ſide, he who dares not ſpeak out openly,
whenever Occaſion offers it ſelf, concerning the Miſcarriages of the
Greateſt Men, or the Vertues of the moſt Unproſperous, has a Soul, below
the Duties, of one, who <hi>writes, that he may deſerve Reading.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, to make a Tranſition to a Subject, which I have, for ſome
Time (in vain) been expecting an Opportunity to <hi>reſume,</hi> with a
Spirit leſs <hi>ludicrous,</hi> than That, in which I touch'd it, not long
ſince: I am rais'd, to ſuch a Height of Wonders, by the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
<hi>Poſture,</hi> in which the <hi>Wit</hi> of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is viſible,
almoſt every Night, at one or other of our Theatres, in the Genius of our
Actors <hi>Limbs,</hi> that there is nothing, which I cannot promiſe my
ſelf, from the Readineſs of their <hi>Elaſtick Capacity</hi>; and the
Humour, which the Town is in, of <hi>liſtning,</hi> to the <hi>Voice</hi> of
their <hi>Muſcles!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE noted, for this Reaſon, what I diſcovered, not without
due Tranſport, as I was peruſing a certain <hi>Venerable</hi> HIGH GER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN

               <p>I HAVE oftentimes, ſays this Grave and Authentick Sage! (for I
reverence him too much to vary a Word, from his Text) <hi>ſeen, with
wondering,</hi> in the Prince of <hi>Bamberg</hi> his Court, a certain
Peaſant of <hi>Germany,</hi> nouriſhed, and brought up, as himſelf
avouched, in the Mountains, <hi>among Beaſts</hi>; who was ſo active, and
nimble, of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that all that ſaw him were <hi>aſtounded,</hi> and
thought he uſed <hi>Enchantment,</hi> which, yet, <hi>I do not, verily think
he did!</hi>—And that, which was moſt remarkable in him was, That he
ſhewed his Agility, <hi>not ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but walking upon his Hands, and his
Feet, prone and flat-back'd, like a Dog, or a Cat!</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> IN that ſame Court, was a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> who would <hi>get
up, upon</hi> this Peaſant, as upon a Horſe; making him to turn, and wind,
all manner of Ways, as a Rider would do a <hi>Spaniſh Genet</hi>; But, when
the <hi>Peaſant liſted,</hi> he wou'd eaſily <hi>throw his Dwarf,</hi>
for all that ever he could do to ſit faſt.—Sometimes he was
<hi>baited,</hi> with <hi>very mighty Maſtives,</hi> and with <hi>Engliſh
Dogs,</hi> that the Prince had: And, by a certain <hi>Barking,</hi> which he
counterfeited naturally, and a <hi>furious ſnarling, like a Dog,</hi> would
give them the Chaſe, and make them run apace, out of the Hall.—That
done, he would ſet himſelf to <hi>leap,</hi> upon his Hands, and Feet,
forwards, and backwards, with a <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0199100802:172"/> 
                  <hi>Nimbleneſs
incredible!</hi> and would <hi>ſcramble up, by the Coines,</hi> towards the
Roof of the Hall, faſter than an <hi>Ape</hi> could do! albeit, otherwiſe,
he was a <hi>ruſtical Fellow, heavy,</hi> and of a <hi>groſs
making.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> I SAW him twice, as I was at the Prince's Table (after he had
thrown his Dwarf) and driven away all the Dogs that were in the Room) leap upon
the Shoulders of one of the Gueſts, and thence upon the Table, without
overturning <hi>Diſh,</hi> or <hi>Cup:</hi> And then caſt himſelf with
ſuch a <hi>Spring</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Floor, that one would have ſaid,
<hi>It</hi> had been a <hi>Squirrel,</hi> or ſome <hi>wild Cat.</hi>—He

Point-wiſe, as our Houſe-Cats would do: And ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other PARTS of a

                  <p> IF you wou'd do a Piece of Service to the Young Men of the
World, whoſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt Ambition it is, to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the
FAIR, without conſidering what <hi>Vertues,</hi> They, whom they love, are
poſſeſs'd of—Let me give them, through your Means, the following
<hi>true</hi> Relation.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Olivia</hi> is a Lady, of genteel, and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Education; for her Mother took early Care to <hi>ſhew her the World,</hi> as
they call it: That is, To teach her, through the moſt contrary
<hi>Appearances,</hi> to intend No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but her <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and
<hi>Intereſt.—Pamphilio</hi> is a Gentleman, of good Eſtate, in the
Neighbourhood.—The Lady's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation was unſullied, He ſaw her
often; and, every Time he ſaw her, ſaw new Marks of her Wit, and Good
Humour; her Freedom and Sincerity; 'till from <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring,</hi> he fell to
<hi>adoring</hi> her.</p>
                  <p> HIS Love was inflam'd, by the little, innocent, Encouragements,
which <hi>Olivia</hi> knew how to give, without incurring the Imputation of
<hi>Forwardneſs:</hi> and which <hi>Pamphilio</hi> regarded, as ſo many
modeſt Overtures, to the Advantage of his Paſſion.—His Viſits
were more frequent, and more open. He could, no longer, conceal his Love; he
declar'd it, at once, to, both, <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0199100802:179"/> 
                     <hi>Olivia,</hi> and her
Mother—for her <hi>Father</hi> was dead: And they, Both, gave him Hope,
of ſucceeding, in his Wiſhes.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Pamphilio</hi>'s Affection growing ſtronger and
ſtronger; he became impatient for their Marriage; in the near Proſpect of
which, all the Neighbourhood rejoyc'd, and did their Utmoſt to advance it.
For they obſerv'd, how his Soul <hi>doated</hi> on her; and darted it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into his <hi>Eyes,</hi> whenever ſhe approach'd him.—<hi>Olivia</hi>
declin'd marrying.—She was too young, ſhe ſaid, to be Miſtreſs of
a Family; and inſiſted on a <hi>Year more,</hi> in which ſhe might fix
her Reſolution.—Tho' this <hi>Year,</hi> to <hi>Pamphilio,</hi> was a
<hi>Lover's Eternity,</hi> he was to ſubmit, on any Terms; and the Time,
requir'd by <hi>Olivia,</hi> at laſt, drew near its Concluſion.—The
Lady, then, grew <hi>cooler,</hi> and the Lover <hi>more
tranſported.</hi>—She declar'd to him, very frankly, That <hi>It was
impoſſible for her to love him.</hi>—Neither <hi>Love,</hi> ſhe
ſaid, nor <hi>Hatred, were Things in our own Power: And he ought not to take
it ill, that ſhe cou'd no longer deceive him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> POOR <hi>Pamphilio</hi> had no Voice to <hi>reply.</hi> But a
ſudden <hi>Tear,</hi> or two, <hi>ſpoke for him!</hi>—He trembled,
grew pale, and gaz'd on her—and ſigh'd, at length this faint
Hope—<hi>That ſhe cou'd not, ſure, be in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</hi>—She
anſwered, <hi>He had no Reaſon to give himſelf the Air of ſo much
Surprize.—She had never promis'd him Marriage,—</hi> 
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0199100802:180"/> 
                     <hi>and was, yet, at her own
Diſpoſal.—Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philio,</hi> bow'd, and left her; and has, alſo, left
<hi>Society.</hi> He ſhuns all his former Companions: And is ſunk, in the
deepeſt Melancholy! His Affairs are neglected, his Health is deſtroy'd; and
his Friends are enrag'd and aſtoniſh'd!</p>
                  <p> ABOUT a Quarter of a Year ago, <hi>Olivia</hi> was
<hi>married:</hi> and with ſo extraordinary a Succeſs, that her Relations
are already upon ſuing out a <hi>Divorce.</hi>—What ought to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Condition of this Lady <hi>Inconſolable,</hi> if ſhe has either
Generoſity, or Reflection, is,—That <hi>Her</hi> hard Fortune afflicts
<hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philio,</hi> to a ſharper Degree than <hi>His own</hi> did!</p>
                  <p> SUCH a <hi>Jilting</hi> Temper, may, perhaps, be conſiſtent
with <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> but it can have neither <hi>Honour,</hi> nor
<hi>Tenderneſs.</hi>—She was form'd to inſpire Love, and very capable
of it, by <hi>Nature:</hi> But ſhe was harden'd, by <hi>Education,</hi> to
become <hi>unſuſceptible</hi> of it.—She expos'd Charms to Sale,
which ſhe intended not to part with: And, then, like a covetous Tradeſman,
who has loſt his beſt Market, ſhe reſolv'd, as a pretty Revenge, <hi>to
throw herſelf away, upon the Firſt Bidder.</hi>

            <p>I NEVER met with any Accident, which more touchingly ſurpriz'd
me, than the Death of my Friend, Sir <hi>Portly Rufus,</hi> under
Circumſtances, with Regard to his Fortune, much inferior to the Figure, he
had maintain'd in the World; and which made ſuch Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on his
departing Soul, as ſerv'd, at once, to excite my Pity, and inflame my
Admiration.</p>
            <p>I VISITED him, during his Sickneſs, and found his Family in
great Diſorder: The chearful Faces, which were formerly worn, by his
Servants, as the lively Signals of his Hoſpitality, were quench'd, and
ſadden'd by a Sorrow, that prov'd its <hi>Deepneſs,</hi> by its
<hi>Silence.</hi>—He was fallen into a forc'd Sleep, 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0199100802:182"/> when I came down to his Houſe in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and it
being late in the Evening, I went to Bed, with a Reſolution not to diſturb
him, 'till the Morning.—I lay awake, and heard the Clock ſtrike
<hi>One,</hi> indulging my Thoughts, under the Solemnity of the Midnight
Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with a Thouſand buſy Reflections, on the Inſtability of our
Health and Pleaſures; when, from an Old Tower of the Pariſh-Church, which
was almoſt contiguous to my Chamber-Window, I heard the <hi>Toll,</hi> of a
Great Bell, ſound out, many Times, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a deep, and mournful
Fullneſs, which left an unuſual Vibration in the Air; and had ſcarce
ceas'd, when I found the whole Family alarm'd; and the Houſe fill'd with
<hi>Shriekings,</hi> and the moſt diſtracted Cries of Sorrow.</p>
            <p>I ROSE, and dreſs'd my ſelf, in much Amazement; and, following
the Clamour, found it, collected in the Sick Man's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:—I was
aſſur'd, at the crowded En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, That <hi>Sir Portly was a Dying
Man.</hi>—That <hi>the Bell, which had toll'd out, at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, always
did ſo, of it's ſelf, before every Death, that was to happen, in the
Family:</hi>—That <hi>it was a Warning, which had never
fail'd:</hi>—And, That <hi>Sir Portly, who had been wak'd, by the Sound
of it, was, himſelf, of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That he could live but a few
Hours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I FOUND my Friend, ſitting up, in his Bed, very faint, and
ſcarce able to ſpeak; and looking round him, with a Mixture of Wildneſs,
and of Sorrow, on the Diſtraction <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0199100802:183"/> of his Aſſembled
Family.—As ſoon as he ſaw me near him, He gave me his Hand, with a
Glimpſe of Chearfulneſs, which ſeem'd to brighten, through his Anguiſh:
And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, with much Earneſtneſs, That I ſhould be left, for
ſome Time, alone, with him, the reſt withdrew, and I ſat near him, on the
Bed-ſide.—He continued ſilent, for ſeveral Minutes, fixing his Eyes
on me, very ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, and with much inward Commotion; till at laſt he
ſpoke to me, as follows.</p>
            <q>YOU have tim'd this Viſit, kindly; for it is the Laſt, you
will ever make me: It is a ſenſible Comfort, that I have this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to communicate my dying Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to a Friend, who will be capable of doing
me Juſtice, where the World may ſpeak of me with a miſtaking
Liberty—</q>
            <p>HERE he put a Key into my Hand, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected me to find a Paper,
which I have now in my Poſſeſſion; and from the Subject of which, I
ſhall take Occaſion, ſome Time hereafter, to draw more Obſervations
than One, for the Uſe of Men of Buſineſs, who may receive Entertainment,
and Advantage, from it.—He ſaid ſomething, concerning his Private
Affairs, in which my Advice he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, might be of Service to his Family:
And, then aſſum'd a Diſcourſe, on the <hi>Toll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pariſh
Bell,</hi> and proceeded in it with much Compoſure.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0199100802:184"/> 
               <p> I HAVE neither Learning, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> nor Leiſure, to
enter upon an Examination, concerning the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of theſe
<hi>Praeter-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Notices.</hi> It is enough for me, that <hi>It is
thus:</hi> And you will ſoon be convinc'd of the Conſequence, with Regard
to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching End.—But, Let not any Thing, ſo common as
<hi>Death,</hi> be an Affliction, or Surprize to you. I have enjoy'd my Bed of
<hi>Sickneſs,</hi> like a <hi>Study.</hi> It has given me an Opportunity of
retiring into my ſelf, without Partiality or Interruption!—The Danger
of my Condition drew a Curtain betwixt the World and me, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all my
Buſineſs into the Compaſs of this ſilent Chamber. Here I have ſeen
Things, <hi>as they are,</hi> and learnt to judge of them, without
Prejudice.</p> 
               <p> TO <hi>forſake the World,</hi> gives me no Pain, from any
Attachment to its Pleaſures. It can tempt me with Nothing <hi>New</hi>; for I
have, already, ſeen it all.—Though I die (as I ſhall) to Night,
<hi>To-morrow</hi> will be like to <hi>To-day</hi>: The ſame <hi>Sun</hi>
will riſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and leave it, in the ſame Darkneſs.—The
Seaſons will come round again, and be <hi>call'd New</hi>; but they will be
no other than the Repetition of what I have, ſo often beheld
already.—Why ſhould it ſtartle me, to be call'd back to the Place,
from which I came hither? I roſe, from Uncertainty, into Life; and I am now
but returning, out of Life, into Uncertainty. Can any Thing 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0199100802:185"/> be more reaſonable, than that <hi>Others</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given Place to <hi>Me,</hi> I ſhould give Place to others, in my
Turn?—Either I have not made the proper <hi>Uſe</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi>
which I have enjoy'd ſo long already, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to hold it no
longer: Or, having reap'd the Profit of Living, to what End ſhould I wiſh
Life lengthen'd?</p> 
               <p> I HAVE many Hopes, 'tis true, which, it grieves my Soul, to

ſeek what is never to be found. It were to act, like thoſe fooliſh
<hi>Indians,</hi> who run themſelves out of Breath, to <hi>catch the
Sun,</hi> when it ſeems to <hi>ſet, ſo near them:</hi>—So might I
travel on, <hi>for ever,</hi> and weary my ſelf, to no Purpoſe: The Object
of my Purſuit is not in the ſame World, where I am!</p> 
               <p> YET there is one Thing, which makes Death <hi>terrible,</hi>
and triumphs over Reaſon, Reflexion, and Philoſophy! It is, That we are
torn from our <hi>Friend's Society.</hi>—That we are divided, by,
perhaps, an <hi>Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Separation, from what <hi>Love</hi> has
made <hi>dearer</hi> to us than our <hi>Life</hi> is! It is that
Blending,—That Liquefaction—or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, of Two Hearts, in one
Will, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and Intereſt, which is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of all human
Bleſſings! Light is Darkneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and Proſperity <hi>not

on Earth, with ſome kindred Spirit, which it delights to mingle with, Death
is <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> when it ſtrikes between us!—How many
unfiniſh'd Purpoſes may it interpoſe it ſelf, to the Diſappointment
of, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Comfort, or Service, of Thoſe, who are thus
<hi>Dear</hi> to us, when we are cut off, by a ſudden Summons, and allow'd no
Time to compleat our yet but intentional Gratitude, or give Perfection to our
unri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd Labours! Can a <hi>Husband</hi> ſit Eaſie <hi>within,</hi> when
he is ſtraining his dying Eyes, for the laſt, afflicting, Sight of a
Wiſe, who deſerv'd his Tenderneſs, and was intitled to his Protection;
but, whom he is, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, compell'd to leave, to ſtruggle with the
Bitterneſs of <hi>Want</hi>; and acquaint her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the
Licentiouſneſs of Reproach, Contempt and Inſult!—Or can there be a
Strength, in Wiſdom, to ſuſtain a dying <hi>Father,</hi> whoſe Heart is
tortur'd with the burning Uncertainty, of what ſhall become of his helpleſs
Children, expos'd Orphans, to an unpitying World, without Guide, Support, or
Proſpect?</p>

            <p>HERE, my Friend was interrupted, by the Impatience of his Family,
who broke in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, with a Grief, which ſoon appear'd to have too juſt a
Ground: For <hi>Sir Portly</hi> died, in leſs than a quarter of an Hour
after.—There were many Circumſtances, in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0199100802:187"/> of his Death, which will deſerve to be deſcrib'd, in

will at preſent be beſt indulg'd by an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of ſome Excellent
Verſes, from a POEM of <hi>Mrs. ELIZABETH SINGER</hi>'s, <hi>on the Death of
Her Husband.</hi>—I am not ſure, that I remember them right; for it is
long, ſince I read them: But there is ſo much of <hi>Beauty, Nature</hi>
and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> in them, that the Reader cannot fail to diſcern,

            <p>IT has been juſtly obſerv'd, by our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in Defence of
the <hi>Stage,</hi> That <hi>It is a</hi> GLASS, <hi>in which we ſee, what
we, our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are, by the Image of our own Actions, repreſented in the
Perſons of Others.</hi>—Commend me then, to the Wit, or the Satire, of
one of our Theatres, where they have brought <hi>Newgate,</hi> into their
<hi>Mirrour,</hi> and taught our People of Quality, the elegant Art of
<hi>breaking Jayl,</hi> by Way of Diverſion and Improvement.</p>
            <p>TO Treat this Subject, if poſſible, with ſome Appearance of
<hi>Gravity,</hi> either the Taſte of our Audiences muſt be depraved, to a
Degree of Horror; or the Judgment of our Maſter-Players corrupted, to a
Degree of Pity!—Too long, indeed, have the moſt Succeſsful of our
Theatrical Entertainments been <hi>Low</hi> and <hi>Contemptible</hi>; but I
never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, before, That they were <hi>Ungenerous,</hi> 
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0199100802:191"/> and <hi>Inhumane!</hi>—What Idea will Poſterity
conceive of the Preſent Age, when they ſhall read, among a thouſand
living Records, to our Infamy, That our Nobility, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of the Firſt
Figure, in Life, cou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to be Partakers in an Inſult offered to the
Memory, and Misfortune, of a poor Wretch, a <hi>Felon,</hi> who had, juſt
before, been Executed, at <hi>Tyburn</hi>; by ſitting, contented Spectators,
to obſerve his Crimes, and his Miſeries, acted over again, for their
Delight, and Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>BUT, If (as <hi>Lucan</hi> ſays of <hi>Nero</hi>) the Gods cou'd
make Way for <hi>CAESAR,</hi> by no other Means than thoſe dreadful Things
which <hi>preceded</hi> him,—If <hi>Nothing leſs</hi> cou'd induce the
Town, to bear with the inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable <hi>CAESAR in AEGYPT,</hi> than their
acting it immediately after SHEPHERD <hi>in</hi> NEWGATE, the Players have, at
leaſt, <hi>One</hi> Good Argument for permitting it:—They made Way too
for a <hi>Brother's Tragedy,</hi> whoſe tender Heart might, have been broke,
if he had, <hi>twice, write diſmally,</hi> to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.—<hi>King
JOHN,</hi> the Dramatick <hi>Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> of laſt Winter, was a
puſillanimous Prince, and cou'd condeſcend to hear Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why it was
neceſſary to ſubmit, for Fear of <hi>a forcible Depoſing:</hi> But
<hi>CAESAR</hi> was a <hi>Hero,</hi> and too <hi>reſolv'd,</hi> to ſhake at
<hi>Danger!</hi>—Tho' all the Serpents, of <hi>Africa,</hi> ſhou'd have
<hi>hiſs'd in his Face,</hi> he would have regarded them, as little, 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0199100802:192"/> as he did, the <hi>Boxes,</hi> the <hi>Pit,</hi> and the
<hi>Gallery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Tragedy is ſo provoking, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious a Field for Satire,
that it is with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culy, I reſtrain my Pen, from the ſevereſt Licence
of juſt <hi>Invectives.</hi> But I ſoften my Indignation, when I turn my
Eye, from the Play to the <hi>Author:</hi>—The Exemplary <hi>Candor,
Humanity, Politeneſs, Affability,</hi> and <hi>Generoſity,</hi> of that
Gentleman's indulgent Behaviour, with Regard to the Works and Intereſt of
other Writers! But, <hi>above all, his prodigious Modeſty!</hi> Theſe, his
extraordinary and well-known, Virtues, overbalance a thouſand Abſurdities
in his Tragedy; and determine me to continue ſilent.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Theatre,</hi> to confeſs the Truth, is a Subject of too
much <hi>Conſequence,</hi> from its Effect on the Morals, and Behaviour of
the <hi>Publick,</hi> to leave it either decent, or reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to omit
Defects in the Stage's Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſcend to the Actor's particular
Failings.—But we have Perſons on the Stage, who want not ſome
<hi>Graces,</hi> and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Qualities, as well of Body, as of Mind, which
might have <hi>adorn'd,</hi> even the Beſt of thoſe Characters, which they
are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to repreſent: And of Theſe I ſhall ſpeak
ſeriouſly, and with Pleaſure, on Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which will offer
themſelves, when I come, in a little Time, to conſider the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
State of our Stage,</hi> and what Juſtice there may be, in thoſe Pretences
to its <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,</hi> 
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0199100802:193"/> which we have heard ſo
very much of, under its Management, as it now ſtands.</p>
            <p>BUT, TO return to my firſt Subject: There have not been wanting,
publick Marks of Diſapprobation, as often as thoſe ill-cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Entertainments above-mentioned have been exhibited: Yet, they <hi>went on, with
an unmoveable Steadineſs of Reſolution,</hi> which, in a Cauſe, the
<hi>Reverſe</hi> of theirs, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be call'd a <hi>Virtue</hi>;
and, even as the Caſe really ſtands, it is an <hi>Accompliſhment, very
new, and Extraordinary,</hi> and muſt be allow'd not unworthy of the
<hi>higheſt Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration!</hi>—That heroic <hi>Roman</hi> Spirit, which
<hi>Horace</hi> ſpeaks of, in the Motto to my PAPER, went no farther than a
private applauding himſelf, at home, in Return for the <hi>Hiſſes,</hi>
which he met with, when abroad: But our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Firmneſs of Face,
can <hi>look Reproach in the Teeth,</hi> and perſevere, with as much
Negligence, and Satisfaction, as if we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for our <hi>Exceſs of
Wit,</hi> what is levell'd at our <hi>Want of Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I WAS favour'd many Months ſince, with a Sheet or Two, of
Excellent Reflexions, which were loſt, by ſome Accident, and have been but
lately recover'd. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obſervations, ſeem ſo applicable to my
preſent Purpoſe, that I cannot do better than borrow them, for Reproof of a
barbarous Cuſtom, which had ſpread itſelf, <hi>too broad,</hi> among us,
before it appear'd on one of our <hi>Theatres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0199100802:194"/>AT <hi>Paris,</hi> and at
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> there is ſcarce a Week paſſes, without ſome
<hi>Publick Execution</hi>; and yet, tho' there are <hi>News-Papers</hi> in
Abundance, we ſeldom, or never, find any Account of that Sort, in
them.—They think, and perhaps juſtly enough, That it is a Point of
National Credit, to conceal, with as much Decency as they can, the Enormities
of their Countrymen.—On the contrary, our Writers for the <hi>Day,</hi>
and the <hi>Week,</hi> watch with Earneſtneſs, for the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and
are ſure to paſs by no ſuch Subject.—It often makes a very Glaring
<hi>Paragraph</hi>; but is ſometimes unhappily ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated. I have
frequently known a <hi>Change at Court</hi> yok'd with a <hi>Remove at
Tyburn;</hi> and both follow'd, cloſe in the Rear, by an Account of ſome
<hi>Church-Advancement</hi>; or new-drawn <hi>Matrimonial Tye,</hi> among
People of Quality.</p>
            <p>I ONLY hint at theſe Liberties, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to deal gently
with my Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.—There are other Wretches among us, who attend

<hi>Subſiſtence</hi> from it.—Not a poor Criminal can be hang'd, but
they break open his expiring Lips, and rob him of his <hi>Laſt Words.</hi>
When he has ſuffer'd the Sentence of the <hi>Law,</hi> he is condemn'd,
afreſh, to a <hi>Libel:</hi> And is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>at Reſt,</hi> even

who <hi>draw</hi> out his Good Name, and <hi>quarter</hi> it; and hang up his
Reputation, in <hi>Effigie,</hi> They give him a <hi>Quarto,</hi> or an
<hi>Octavo</hi> Shrowd; and fringe, and flouriſh it with his <hi>Birth,</hi>

            <p>TO be <hi>half-hang'd,</hi> has been the Caſe of one or two

when a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal's Account of <hi>Himſelf</hi> is ſuppos'd to be
<hi>true,</hi> it ſeems a Mifortune that They, who wilfully, <hi>belye,</hi>

and read, then, beſides his <hi>Birth,</hi> and <hi>Education,</hi> his

Ghoſt:</hi> And if his Life has been at all remarkable, we have <hi>His

bundles up his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi> and deſcribes his Exploits, in ſo

            <p>I KNOW not whether ſuch <hi>Expoſing</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as Theſe,

becauſe they can't tell how elſe to diſpoſe of

<hi>knew</hi> them, for they were his Cuſtomers of five Years ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;

cou'd ſhew them; Exclaim, at his <hi>fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prices,</hi> and make it a

               <p> AFTER having reflected on my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and on Marriage, I
fell aſleep, and found my ſelf in a <hi>Myrtle Grove,</hi> where ſeveral
<hi>Ways</hi> ran together into one Great Path, that led to the <hi>Temple of
Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>—The Flowers, moſt of which were <hi>Violets,</hi> and
<hi>bleeding Lovers,</hi> exhal'd a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Odour: And the Birds, that
warbled round me, help'd to fill the Scene with Tranſport.</p> 
               <p> I OBSERV'D Crowds of Travellers, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing onward; but none,
to my great Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, <hi>repaſſing.</hi>—Upon looking a little
nearer, I diſcover'd Troops of flying Boys with Silver Wings, that hover'd
before them, for their <hi>Guides.</hi> There were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Ranks, and
of both Sexes.</p> 
               <p> I TOOK particular Notice of ſome, who tho' they ſeem'd to
make more Haſte then the reſt, were, at the End, the fartheſt
behind-hand. Theſe, I heard, were call'd <hi>Coquets,</hi> in the Language of
the Country. <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0199100802:203"/> They ſeem'd, to do nothing but ſport,
and flutter about; without gaining any Ground, or <hi>deſiring</hi> to gain
any.</p> 
               <p> THE next, I was told, were <hi>Prudes:</hi> And theſe had taken
a Bye-Path, and mov'd onward, toward the Temple, very ſlowly; and, to all
Appearance, unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; with their Necks fantaſtically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and their
Eyes looking back, upon the Country, they had newly paſs'd through. Yet
Theſe were the Firſt that came up; and ſlipt, ſilently into the
Temple!</p> 
               <p> AMONG the Men, was a Troop, which ſeem'd compos'd of the moſt
expert Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers. My Guide inform'd me, They were call'd <hi>Hibernians.</hi>
They did many Things, I perceiv'd, very differently from the reſt: For, while
others led up but <hi>one</hi> Companion, to the Temple, theſe had
ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in ſeveral Paths; and were the only Perſons, who, after lodging
<hi>One,</hi> went out again, to conduct <hi>Another.</hi>—It was eaſy
to diſtinguiſh them, however mingled in the Crowd, by the <hi>Shine</hi> of
a certain <hi>Metal,</hi> which had burniſh'd their Cheeks, and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
and caſt a <hi>Gleam,</hi> like a <hi>Corinthian Vizard.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> I WAS call'd off, by a confus'd Noiſe, at ſome Diſtance;
and made toward it, as well as I cou'd; but found ſuch an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the
Air, that I cou'd not ſtir one Step, without ſneezing. This was a Troop of
<hi>Sword-Knots,</hi> and <hi>Cockades,</hi> diſplaying <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0199100802:204"/> a powerful Inſtrument, that glitter'd much, and was call'd a
<hi>Snuff-Box.</hi> The Scuffle of Tongues was ſo great, that I ſtaid not
long, among the <hi>Pretty Gentlemen,</hi> (for that was the Name they went by)
but paſs'd on, to a Part of the Grove, whence there iſſued a delightful
<hi>Harmony.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> COMING thither, I obſerv'd a Number, apart from the reſt,
with Harps in their Hands, which they touch'd, with tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Melody.
Nine Goddeſſes were mix'd among them: all moſt raviſhingly beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!
Theſe happy Gentlemen, I found, were the Favourites of the Grove; but they
made no Haſte to the Temple; rather wandering up and down, and making
<hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> into every Path, with an Air of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Indifference.</p> 
               <p> I LEFT them, and came up with a Troop of Clowdy, Haughty, and
Erect, Movers, diſtinguiſh'd by <hi>peculiar Head-Pieces,</hi> which, at
Diſtance, look'd like <hi>Diadems.</hi> All the Female Travellers, they
chanc'd to meet with, receiv'd their Whiſpers with a kind of Triumph; and
liſten'd to them with more Rapture, than even to the Voices of thoſe
<hi>Divine Muſicians!</hi>—This Train was under the Care of two
Goddeſſes, whoſe Names were <hi>Inſolence</hi> and <hi>Privilege!</hi>
I was now within the Sight of the Temple; but taking an Averſion, in my
Sleep, to the affected <hi>Struttings</hi> of this Company, I wak'd fortunately
out of my Dream, and reſolv'd to ſend it to the PLAIN-DEALER.</p>

Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment;</hi> where, for the ſame Rates which were paid his Rivals, he
treated the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, in their own Way, with <hi>raw Horſe Fleſh,</hi>
inſtead of <hi>Ragouſts</hi>; and <hi>Spring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in the Place of
<hi>Brandy.</hi>—The <hi>Bears</hi> were ſtrangely delighted, at a
Change, they were, ſo able to reliſh; and flock'd, in Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, to
their <hi>New Ordinary</hi>; where they <hi>grinn'd,</hi> and grew
<hi>fat,</hi> upon a <hi>Diet,</hi> which was adapted to their Palates: So
that, in a little Time, not a <hi>Cub,</hi> of any <hi>Quality,</hi> cou'd make
a Meal, upon their <hi>Old Commons.</hi> And the poor Shepherd, who provided
for them, <hi>ſo judiciouſly,</hi> had all their Cuſtom, for the future,
and became Richer, than the <hi>King's own Bear-Wards!</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0199100802:207"/>How ſuch an odd Story as this came in my
Way, I know not; But I will leave it, as I found it: For I am in a Humour to
talk of the <hi>Theatres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Royal Company of Comedians</hi> differs from the
<hi>South-Sea-Company,</hi> the <hi>Bank,</hi> and other <hi>Acting
Companies,</hi> of this <hi>City,</hi> in this one Point, among more, That It
has <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> but no <hi>Governour.</hi>—It is certain,
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that thoſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> whom they call their
<hi>Managers,</hi> have had all poſſible Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on their Side. The
Court-Authority, and Countenance, went with them.—The <hi>Noble,</hi> and
the <hi>Ignoble,</hi> join'd in a long, and unreaſonable Partiality, to
ſupport them, <hi>without Rivals</hi>; in direct Oppoſition to the
Intereſt of their own Pleaſure; which is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, beſt provided
for, when <hi>Rival Theatres</hi> contend, which ſhall, moſt deſerve
Encouragement.—It is worth while, then to examine, how they
<hi>loſt</hi> this Advantage. And I take the Fact to be thus.</p>
            <p>THE good <hi>Old Patentee,</hi> of the <hi>New Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> died,
under a Length of Oppreſſion; and left his <hi>Right,</hi> and his
<hi>Houſe,</hi> to his <hi>Son</hi>; an Unfear'd, and Friendleſs Youth! of
whom it might then have been ſaid, as of <hi>Chamont,</hi> in the
<hi>Orphan.</hi> 
               <q>His <hi>Hopes</hi> were <hi>all</hi> his Fortune!</q>
            </p>
            <p>HE <hi>Open'd,</hi> againſt a Tide of <hi>Prejudice</hi>; and
acted many Years, not only, without <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0199100802:208"/> 
               <hi>Favour,</hi> but
almoſt without <hi>Notice,</hi> at leaſt from the <hi>Faſhionable
World.</hi>—He try'd every <hi>Reaſonable</hi> Art of
<hi>Pleaſing,</hi> without Succeſs!—He reviv'd the beſt old <hi>Old
Plays,</hi> and brought on ſeveral <hi>New Ones!</hi> but had, often the
Mortification to oppoſe his own <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and the ſublimeſt
Scenes of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> to the cold Encouragement of <hi>Empty
Boxes!</hi>—What ſhou'd he do, in this Caſe?—The Torrent of
Opinion was <hi>againſt him.</hi> Good <hi>Senſe,</hi> and ſolid
<hi>Thinking,</hi> were as Uſeleſs to him as his
<hi>Boxkeepers!</hi>—At laſt, by a Quickneſs in his <hi>Natural
Wit;</hi> and a Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sharpneſs in his <hi>Obſervation,</hi> He
perceiv'd he had nothing to do, if he wou'd have the <hi>Game</hi> play'd into
his Hands, but to lay aſide his <hi>Judgment,</hi> and abandon Himſelf to
his <hi>Fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN Purſuance of this lucky <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> He compos'd a
<hi>New Species of Entertainment,</hi> which had an infinite deal of
<hi>Senſe</hi> in them; but it was only the <hi>Senſe</hi> of
<hi>Seeing.</hi>—It is ſcarce poſſible to conceive the
<hi>Eaſe,</hi> which this Reformation of the Stage gave the Bulk of our
<hi>Genteel Audiences</hi>!—They, cou'd, now, laugh out, without
Reſtraint; for they were no longer in Danger of <hi>being Merry, in the wrong
Place!</hi> They felt no Weight of <hi>Words,</hi> which had formerly <hi>lain
heavy</hi> upon their <hi>Underſtandings:</hi> And, the Burden of their
<hi>Attention</hi> being, ſo commodiouſly, <hi>ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd,</hi> they
<hi>came,</hi> and <hi>ſaw,</hi> and were <hi>ſatisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0199100802:209"/>THE old <hi>Managers</hi> were indiſcreet
enough not only to <hi>envy,</hi> but to <hi>imitate</hi> him.—They made
That their <hi>Choice,</hi> which, in their <hi>Rival,</hi> had been
<hi>Neceſſity.</hi> But, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temping it, with inferior Genius, they
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo aukward, and ungraceful in it, that they <hi>compell'd</hi>
their partial <hi>Admirers to take Notice, That they were
excell'd</hi>—And, ſo taught 'em, from that Time forward, to believe it
probable, That, ſince in <hi>one</hi> Point, they had, ſo manifeſtly, the
<hi>Diſadvantage,</hi> they might, in <hi>Others</hi> too, have been rather
<hi>Fortunate,</hi> than ſo <hi>Deſerving,</hi> as they had concluded
them.</p>
            <p>THUS, the <hi>Young,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſs'd,</hi> became a a
Match for the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Proſperous.</hi>—He has continued,
ever ſince to maintain the Ground he won; 'till the Current is, now, turn'd,
and diſpos'd to <hi>run, in his Favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SO far, his <hi>Wit</hi> has carried him. We are to look out for
his <hi>Judgment hereafter.</hi> But, for my Part, I am of Opinion, That, when
he ſhall have <hi>toy'd</hi> us into Good Humour enough to forgive him a
little <hi>Reaſon,</hi> he will have Courage and Generoſity, to reſtore
the Stage to its Dignity; and exchange our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps</hi> for
<hi>Subſtantial Diets,</hi> as ſoon as our ſick Stomachs ſhall have
recover'd Strength enough to digeſt it.—There is ſcarce a ſurer
<hi>Proof,</hi> That a Man has <hi>Worth,</hi> than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which he
ſhews the <hi>Worthy:</hi> And I was delighted, the other Day, with the
Praiſes, in which I heard it told, at an <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> That the 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0199100802:210"/> 
               <hi>OLD BATCHELOR</hi> is, by this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Voluntary Offer, to be acted, next <hi>Monday,</hi> at the <hi>Theatre</hi> in
<hi>Lincoln's-Inn Fields,</hi> for the Benefit of ſo Learned a Benefactor to
the Stage, as Mr. <hi>DENNIS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON my expreſſing ſome Concern, That it was not rather a
Play, of Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s own Writing, I was inform'd, That the Maſter
of that <hi>Theatre,</hi> who ſought all Opportunities of ſhewing his
Eſteem of ſo Excellent, and ſo Injur'd a Judge of Wit, and Learning, had
left the <hi>Choice</hi> of the <hi>Play</hi> to Mr. <hi>Dennis
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> who had pitch'd upon the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, becauſe it was a
Work of his old Friend Mr. <hi>Congreve.</hi>—I acknowledg'd the
<hi>Generoſity</hi> of the Maſter of the <hi>Theatre,</hi> and the
<hi>Modeſty</hi> of the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> whom he treats with ſo
well-judg'd a Humanity: But I cou'd not avoid indulging a Fit of talkative
<hi>Spleen,</hi> againſt that <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which
has more than once, appear'd in the Diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſome Writings, from
which the <hi>Name</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> will, long, continue to receive
Honour, after his <hi>Body</hi> ſhall be Duſt and Aſhes!</p>
            <p>THE Stupidity which follows <hi>Prejudice,</hi> has made
Thouſands of his Cotemporaries inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his Great Merit, which, if
they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd their Reaſon to examine it, they wou'd be <hi>charm'd by,</hi>
and take a <hi>Pride</hi> to <hi>encourage.</hi>—The Terror with which
young Writers have accuſtom'd themſelves to hear, and to talk of, his
<hi>Auſterity,</hi> and of his Averſion <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0199100802:211"/> againſt
<hi>Scriblers,</hi> has ſpread abroad a falſe Opinion, that he is
<hi>Ill-natur'd,</hi> where he is only <hi>impartial:</hi> And, that he is an
Enemy to <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> while he is only ſuch to the
<hi>Prophaners</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>IT is pleaſant to obſerve, to what a whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Degree this
<hi>Dread</hi> of <hi>Criticks</hi> has been propagated; and how far down, into
Low Life, we may trace the Effects of our Poet's miſtaken Outcries, who, by
giving their <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds</hi> the Name of <hi>Wolves,</hi> have taught the
Clowns to ſet their Dogs upon 'em, and cut off the Defence of their own Fold.
Honeſt Mr. <hi>David Cook,</hi> the ingenious <hi>Bell-Man</hi> of

Reaſon for the Fears of ſo ſafe a Muſe as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s, yet I
can't help wiſhing, that no great Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had ever allow'd himſelf to join
the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cry againſt Criticks.—If the Poets have <hi>no Art,</hi>
they are a Race of Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Triflers! and if they have <hi>Art,</hi> they
have <hi>Criticiſm.</hi>—Whoever is a good <hi>Poet,</hi> is, and
muſt be, <hi>Himſelf,</hi> a <hi>Critick.</hi>—To be afraid of a
<hi>Judge,</hi> is the Mark of a <hi>criminal Conſcience.</hi>—But the
ſevere, and manly, Cenſures, which are peculiar to Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s
Writings, have encreas'd the Number of his Enemies, by a piercing
<hi>Sharpneſs,</hi> which they carry with them? Such Arguers, if they had
liv'd with <hi>Cato,</hi> wou'd have made War upon that <hi>noble
Plainneſs,</hi> which diſtinguiſh'd, and ſupported, his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: And
refus'd the Reverence, due to his <hi>Vertues,</hi> becauſe His
<hi>Manners</hi> were not ſupple enough, to fall in with their Notions of
<hi>Politeneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE beſt Way to become acquainted with a Writer is, to look for
him in his Writings:—His <hi>Soul,</hi> which is his Nobleſt
<hi>Self,</hi> lives there, and is, there <hi>diſcovered.</hi>—How
often have I remember'd (with Pain, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy it muſt, one Day bring
us) That the moſt generous, and extenſive Deſign, that ever was conceived
by Man, with Relation to the <hi>Groundwork</hi> of <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> in
<hi>Poetry,</hi> was once, undertaken, by this Gentleman, <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0199100802:213"/> and a Subſcription for it propos'd, upon the moſt moderate
Terms, with ſo diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd a Succeſs, that after a Year or two's
fruitleſs Application, he publiſh'd a <hi>Specimen</hi> of his intended
Work, with an Apology for not proceeding in it: Becauſe, after ſo long a
Trial, he had been able to procure no more than <hi>Seventy or Eighty
Subſcribers,</hi> whoſe <hi>NAMES</hi> he printed, to their Glory! For,
they will be read, an Age or two hence, with a Veneration, not unlike That,
with which the <hi>Athenians</hi> engrav'd thoſe of the <hi>Three Hundred

defended the Honour of their Country's <hi>Judgment,</hi> againſt an
Inundation, of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Preſumption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT will make this Fact more wonder'd at, is,—That it
happen'd at a Time, when a boundleſs Profuſion of Encouragement was pour'd
out, upon all Pretenſions, but Thoſe of <hi>Learning,</hi> and of
<hi>Modeſty!</hi>—But it will not, I hope, be <hi>believ'd,</hi> That

as above, the Play of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> next, is to be acted: And, who, now,

            <p>I HAVE ſomewhere, met with a Story of one of the ancient
Princes, of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> I think, it was ANTIOCHUS.—He was
hunting, and loſt his Followers; and Night coming on, after a tedious
Wandering, over Heaths, and Foreſts he came at laſt, to a little Cottage,
where the Poor People were at Supper, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him, very chearfully, as
a Traveller, who had loſt his way. The chief Subject of their Diſcourſe,
was concerning the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Miniſters.</hi>—As for
the <hi>King himſelf,</hi> they accus'd him of <hi>no Vices.</hi>—They
ſpoke of him with much Duty; and agreed, That he <hi>meant well,</hi> and was
deſirous of his Subject's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: But he was not, they ſaid, ſo
abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, the <hi>Monarch</hi> of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as of his
People: Submitting his own Senſe of Affairs, <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0199100802:216"/> and the
Authority of his Determinations, to Men of leſs Vertue, and Underſtanding,
than Himſelf; and giving Way to Eaſe, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, while he devol'd the
Power of his Office, on Wretches, whoſe Hearts were too narrow, and their
Paſſions too violent, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any Government at all; much leſs That
of a <hi>Kingdom</hi>!</p>
            <p>THE King ſaid little to all This; but laid it up, for his Uſe,
and Benefit: And, in the Morning, when his Guards, and the Great Men, of his
Court, having follow'd the Track of his Horſe, were come to him, at the
Cottage, he receiv'd them with this Declaration.—<hi>You are miſtaken,
if you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I have been, all Night, out of my Way.—I have ſat
in Counſel, with an Aſſembly of the only Honeſt, and faithful
Adviſers, I met with, ſince I became your Sovereign. Nor did I ever hear a
Word, of the True Condition of my Affairs before I learnt it, in this
Cottage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Condition of a Nation, where <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> have their
Prince in <hi>Pupilage,</hi> is ſo vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Reverſe</hi> of
<hi>Ours,</hi> That a Diſcourſe, on ſuch a Subject muſt be forc'd to
draw <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> either from the Hiſtories of Foreign Countries, or
from our own, remov'd, far backward.—But, as the Bleſſing of a
perfect <hi>Health</hi> is never better underſtood, and valued, than while he
who is ſo happy as to enjoy it, employs himſelf in reading the
<hi>Symptoms,</hi> of ſome dangerous, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi>
ſo the Comfort, which we, <hi>Free</hi> 
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0199100802:217"/>
               <hi>Britons</hi> muſt receive, from a Compariſon, of our <hi>own
Happineſs,</hi> with the <hi>Miſery of Others,</hi> is an Argument, which
convinces me, that no Theme deſerves, more juſtly, the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of
a PLAIN DEALER.</p>
            <p>I WILL venture to lay it down, as a <hi>Maxim,</hi> That, where
the Soul of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> is not <hi>Great</hi> enough, to
<hi>overlook,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and to drown all <hi>Perſonal Regards,</hi>
in the Ocean of his <hi>Publick Cares,</hi> let his other <hi>Vertues,</hi> and
good <hi>Qualities,</hi> be never ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and ſo ſhining, he will
confound his Prince's Intereſt, with his own private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments.
Inſtead of <hi>healing</hi> Diviſions, he will <hi>inflame</hi> them; and,
by a Thouſand paſſionate <hi>Extravagancies,</hi> draw upon himſelf a
Univerſal <hi>Hatred</hi>; and upon his Sovereign, a <hi>Contempt,</hi> that
is the moſt dangerous of all Motives to Sedition; and, what wiſe Princes
have been careful to guard themſelves againſt, by a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
<hi>Activity,</hi> which, even where they have not been <hi>lov'd,</hi>
ſerv'd, at leaſt, to make them <hi>fear'd</hi>; which is the <hi>next</hi>
ſure An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Beſt of Princes have had their <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:</hi> But, it
is the eaſieſt Thing in the World to diſtinguiſh the MINION from the
MINISTER. The MINISTER is his Prince's Inſtrument; The MINION makes an
Inſtrument of his Prince—Under a MINI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STER, the common Themes, of all
publick Converſation, are his Great Deſigns, for the Ornament, or the
Intereſt of the Kingdom—<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0199100802:218"/> Benevolence, Mercy,
Wiſdom, <hi>Generoſity,</hi> and <hi>Magnificence,</hi> flow down upon the
People, in a Current of new Laws, and Benefits.—On the contrary, under a
MINION, nothing is talk'd of, but his Subtlety, his Malice, and his

<hi>Satyre,</hi> which gives a lively Repreſentation of the General
<hi>Odium,</hi> theſe buſie MINIONS are always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to live
under.—He was hated for his Cruelty, and Exactions; but carried,
never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, an <hi>Outſide</hi> of Charity and Religion. 
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0199100802:220"/> He met a <hi>Dervis,</hi> one Day, in the Street; and,
having ſtop't, to give him Alms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended himſelf to his
<hi>Prayers.</hi>—The <hi>Dervis,</hi> lifting up his Eyes, to Heaven,
cry'd out, with a loud Voice, <hi>Take him from us, O Great God! Take him from
us, I beſeech Thee!—Hagi-Juſouf</hi> was not ſatisfied with the
Turn of this Prayer; and began to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at the <hi>Dervis:</hi> But the

Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,—<hi>It is good for you, and for All the</hi>
Muſſulmans.</p>
            <p>THE Truth is, there is an unavoidable Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that Princes
ſhou'd be aſſiſted by ſuch Subjects as they think fit to Favour: But
it is happy, where the Maſter has <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the Servant
<hi>Moderation:</hi> For, in that Caſe, the Miſchief will be either
prevented, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, before its Progreſs is become
conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—Opinion, and the Obſtinancy of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, have made
a mighty Noiſe in the World, concerning the Differences between
<hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Limited</hi> Government: But, in the Nature of
Things, there is neither <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power</hi> nor <hi>Freedom</hi>;
taking them in their full Senſe.—Every <hi>Whale</hi> has its
<hi>little leading Fiſh,</hi> and follows it, with a Kind of unweildy
Obſequiouſneſs! This, in the <hi>Sea,</hi> has been thought a Wonder, but
few Things, on <hi>Land,</hi> are more uſual, and familiar.—The moſt
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, of the <hi>State Leviathans,</hi> have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, and led along,
by a <hi>Wife,</hi> a <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi>

<hi>Favourite,</hi> or ſome other ſuch <hi>dimunitive Pilot</hi>: So that
in an unlimited Signification, there is no ſuch Thing as
<hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Grand Signior</hi> it is true, can cauſe any of his
Subjects to be <hi>Strangled,</hi> without aſſigning other Reaſons for
it, than his <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Will, and Pleaſure.</hi> But, how ſeldom is this
done, at his <hi>own mere Motion</hi>; and how often, at that of his
<hi>Vizier</hi>'s, and tyrannick <hi>Minions?—I my ſelf,</hi> (ſays a
Writer of the laſt Age) <hi>have known ſome Sovereigns, ſo far Strangers
to what was convenient, that they wou'd ſcarce grant, or deny, any Thing, out
of the Preſence of their</hi> Secretary.</p>
            <p>THERE is but one <hi>Conſolation,</hi> which can give Men
Patience, while they are <hi>ſuffering,</hi> under the Inſolence of ſuch
Upſtart Tyrants: And that is, their reaſonable Hope, that they ſhall live
to ſee the <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> when the <hi>Guilt</hi> is ripe enough for
Vengeance—It is long, before a Prince can break out of the obſcuring
Miſt, which an Evil Counſellor will conjure up, and involve him
in—But, when by Accident, or Reflection, he comes, at length, to clear
his Eye-ſight, and ſee Things, in their proper Colours, the
<hi>Minion,</hi> then firſt, becomes a <hi>Benefit</hi> to the People he has
injur'd; for he leaves them a Protection, in the Example of his Fall, which may
guard them, in Times to come, againſt the Malice of a New Oppreſſor.</p>

               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0199100802:222"/>THE laſt Emperor of <hi>China,</hi> was
one of the greateſt Monarchs, of his Age, and for nothing more celebrated,
than the Vigour, and Strictneſs, of his <hi>Juſtice:</hi> But he was warm,
in his Purſuits of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Interruption, when
his Mind was intent upon it.—The <hi>Viceroy</hi> of one of the
Provinces, of that vaſt Empire that lay moſt remote from the Imperial City,
had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confiſcated the Eſtate of an honeſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and
reduc'd his Family to the extremeſt Miſery.—The poor Man found means
to travel as far as to the Emperor's Court, and carried back with him a Letter
to the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> commanding him to <hi>reſtore</hi> the Goods, which
he had taken, ſo illegally.</p>
            <p>FAR from obeying this Command, the <hi>Viceroy</hi> put the
Merchant in Priſon; but he had the good Fortune to eſcape, and went, once
more, to the <hi>Capital,</hi> where he caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Emperor's
Feet, who treated him with much Humanity, and gave Orders, that he ſhould
have <hi>another Letter.</hi> The Merchant wept, at this Reſolution, and
repreſented how ineffectual the Firſt had prov'd; and the Reaſons he had
to fear, that the Second wou'd be as little regarded.</p>
            <p>THE Emperor, who had been ſtopt, by this Complaint, as he was
going, with much Haſte, to Dine in the Apartment of a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Lady, grew a
little diſcompos'd, and anſwer'd, with ſome Emotion—<hi>I can do no
more than ſend my Commands: And, if he</hi> 
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0199100802:223"/>
               <hi>refuſes to obey them, put thy Foot upon his Neck.</hi>—I implore
your Majeſty's Compaſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Merchant, holding faſt the
Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Robe, his <hi>Power</hi> is too mighty for my <hi>Weakneſs:</hi>
And your <hi>Juſtice</hi> preſcribes a Remedy, which your <hi>Wiſdom</hi>
has never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd.</p>
            <p>THE Emperor had, by this Time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected himſelf; and
raiſing the Merchant from the Ground, ſaid, <hi>You are in the
Right—To complain of him was your Part, but it is mine to ſee him
puniſh'd.—I will appoint Commiſſioners, to go back with you, and
make ſearch into the Grounds of his Proceeding; with Power, if they find him
guilty, to deliver him into your Hands, and leave</hi> you Viceroy, <hi>in his
ſtead.—For, Since you have</hi> taught me how to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, <hi>You</hi>
muſt <hi>be able to</hi> Govern for me.</p>

            <p>MANY Writers, beſides the Author of my <hi>Motto,</hi> have

to our <hi>Pride,</hi> or our <hi>Avarice.</hi> But I am afraid, I ſhall
touch this Subject, with very little Effect; becauſe I have a Thouſand
Times, obſerved, That there is a <hi>healing Quality</hi> in <hi>Vanity,</hi>
which cures the <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0199100802:225"/> Wounds of good Counſel. Lady
<hi>Low-taſte</hi> finds <hi>SENECA ſo dull,</hi> where he lays open a

noble Lovelineſs of <hi>Generoſity,</hi> That ſhe can neither
<hi>reliſh,</hi> nor <hi>ſupport</hi> him, but falls <hi>aſleep,</hi>
over his Philoſophy, as the readieſt Way to be even with him!—Yet,
who ſo lively in her Attention, and ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported an Admirer of
<hi>this very Seneca,</hi> where he happens to ſpeak <hi>kindly,</hi> of any
Vertue, ſhe is conſcious of, in <hi>herſelf</hi>; or <hi>ſeverely,</hi>
of of any Vice, which ſhe can charge upon Her
<hi>Acquaintance!</hi>—There are <hi>Two Ends</hi> to the Glaſs, thro'
which we look into ourſelves, and others. One <hi>contracts</hi> Objects; and
one <hi>enlarges</hi> them: And, it is the pleaſanteſt Obſervation in the
World, to remark, how kindly <hi>Nature</hi> has inſtructed the ſillieſt,
and blindeſt, of both Sexes, to apply either End of this
<hi>Perſpective,</hi> ſo as to anſwer their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Purpoſe, with

            <p>I AM overwhelm'd with Letters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, againſt <hi>Fate,
Ill-Luck, Blind Fortune,</hi> and the whole Train of <hi>malevolent
Chimera's,</hi> under whoſe Shadow it is uſual to hide the Effects of our

Fortieth Year of Fluttering, has fill'd Three Pages of an angry <hi>Epiſtle,
Falſehood, Traitor,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy,</hi> againſt a Couſin of

            <p>WHAT ſhall we ſay to theſe inſupportable Misfortunes? They

bear: And, for what remains, I can do no more than provide a little Comfort for
ſuch <hi>afflicted Vertue,</hi> by a Proof, That there are Others, almoſt

                  </opener>
                  <p> I CONTRACTED a ſtrict Friendſhip, with a Gentleman: And we
liv'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſome Time; during which he fell in Love with a Young
Lady, between whoſe <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> there ſeems to be a
perpetual War, which of the Two, ſhall appear <hi>moſt
beautiful!</hi>—But ſhe was <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,</hi> by her Relations, to
one, whoſe <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> is much Superior to my Friends.—Yet, he
had frequent Opportunity of <hi>Diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> his <hi>Paſſion,</hi>
but wanted Courage to <hi>declare,</hi> what he, as much wanted Power to
<hi>conceal,</hi> and, ſo, was forc'd, in Search of <hi>Reſt,</hi> to
retire into the Country.</p>
                  <p> BUT Abſence, inſtead of leſſening, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd, and
rivetted, his Anguiſh.—He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to me, in great Diſorder; and
deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a Letter into my Hands, preſs'd me, with the moſt moving Words,
and Geſtures, to convey it, privately, to the Lady's.</p>
                  <p> NOW, Sir, you muſt not ſtart, when I ask you this
Queſtion,—<hi>Whether I ought to deliver it?</hi> The Difficulty lies
here—I know, her Relations have a particular Averſion to this
Gentleman.—And they are Perſons, to whom I owe a Thouſand Benefits,
and Obligations.—My <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is dear to my
<hi>Soul,</hi>—and my <hi>Gratitude</hi> is due to my <hi>Honour.</hi> I
wou'd not <hi>appear to betray</hi> Thoſe <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0199100802:228"/> who have
ſo ſtrong a Claim to my <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>—On the other hand, I was
tender of ſhocking the Delicacy, and Refinement, of a Paſſion, ſo
ſacred as our <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> Love is raſh, and diſtruſtful;
takes Alarm at every Trifle; and judges haſtily, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon. He
wou'd conclude, if I <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd him,</hi> That his Peace, and Intereſt, are
of no Weight with me.—Wou'd he had thought of <hi>another Means</hi> of
conveying his Letter to the Lady!—But, now, ſhou'd I adviſe him to
it, it wou'd look like Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Cauſe; and his Imagination wou'd
take Fire, with ſo many falſe Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, That he cou'd never
preſerve <hi>Temper,</hi> to conſider, That he has puſh'd me, where there
is no Neceſſity for it, on the ſureſt Step by which I can incur the
Hatred, and the Reproaches, of a Family, to which I am indebted, for almoſt
every Thing, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune favours me in!</p>
                  <p> IN this Struggle, between the Duties of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi>
and of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> I can come to no Reſolution. I have Friends
enough, on whoſe Advice, in other Things, I ſet a very conſiderable
Value: But, there is no Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I wou'd follow ſo ſoon, in a Point of
this <hi>Niceneſs,</hi> as that of the PLAIN-DEALER. It is the firſt
Requeſt I have ever made to you; and, I hope, you will not refuſe your
Anſwer.—When I tell him whoſe Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation I act by, I am ſure,
it will ſatisfie him: And, if you <hi>deny</hi> me, the Prejudice 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0199100802:229"/> may be Infinite.—Let me have but a ſingle
<hi>Paragraph,</hi> to direct me: Or, if that be too much, give me a
<hi>Yes,</hi> or a <hi>No,</hi> at the Bottom of One of your <hi>Papers</hi>;
and it ſhall be enough, for one of your ſincereſt Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</p>

            <p>'METHINKS the Difficulty, in this Caſe, is not ſo great, as
the <hi>lively Painting</hi> which deſcribes it, makes it appear, upon a
firſt View.—Since the Lover is ſo worthy of the Lady, (if he had no
other Means of reaching, or being recommended to her, but thro' the Hands of
<hi>This Friend</hi>) my Correſpondent, without all Doubt, wou'd have ſtood
bound to deliver the Letter; and try the utmoſt of his Influence, to render
it ſucceſsful: And the rather, becauſe <hi>Intereſt</hi> only, and not
<hi>Merit,</hi> ſeems to have recommended the <hi>Rival.</hi>—But,
ſince it is ſo eaſy to find other Means, as effectual; and the Favours,
receiv'd by my Correſpondent, from the Lady's Family, are ſtrong Motives
againſt his Friend's em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying him, where there is no viſible
Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that confines the Choice to <hi>him only,</hi> he appears, to
me, a little <hi>miſtaken,</hi> when he ſtrips <hi>Friendſhip</hi> of
that generous <hi>Freedom,</hi> without which, it can never ſubſiſt; and
puniſhes himſelf with ſuch inward Conflicts, in Support of a
<hi>Delicacy</hi>;; which, tho' it <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies</hi> the <hi>Face</hi> of
<hi>Friendſhip,</hi> is rather the <hi>Dreſs,</hi> than the <hi>Body,</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0199100802:230"/>OF all human Paſſions, this, of
<hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> is the moſt refin'd, and I might, almoſt, ſay
too, the moſt <hi>ardent.</hi> But I wou'd be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to ſpeak of the
<hi>Thing:</hi> For the <hi>Word</hi> is much more common, and leſs
powerful.—Moſt People, when they ſay <hi>Friend,</hi> mean
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,</hi> or <hi>Acquaintance.</hi> But, alas! what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Difference!—How Few can diſtinguiſh between <hi>Friendſhip,</hi>
(which is a Parity of Souls) and <hi>Affection,</hi> which is a Claim of Blood;
or a Tye of mutual Intereſts; or an Agreement, of Hopes, or Fears, or
Principles, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; or any of theſe miſtaken <hi>Fellowſhips,</hi>
which are <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> but <hi>not
Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I SAID, it was the moſt <hi>refin'd,</hi> of all our
Paſſions: And it is <hi>ſo,</hi> from its Diſ-intereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, its
Nobleneſs, and its Exemption from all <hi>Earthly</hi> Motives. It is a
<hi>ſtrugling</hi> of the conſcious <hi>Soul,</hi> to enlarge her
<hi>Limits,</hi> in the <hi>Body,</hi> and exert herſelf, in generous

                  <p> HAVING lately met with an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of looking back, upon a
Compleat <hi>SETT</hi> of your PLAIN DEALERS, the laſt Paragraph, in your
<hi>Paper</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> the 9th of <hi>November,</hi> puts me upon
asking, Whether it would not be worth while, to beſtow an <hi>Eſſay</hi>
to ſhew the <hi>Honour,</hi> as well as the <hi>Profit</hi> of
<hi>TRADE</hi>; in order to remove that miſtaken Motion, which
poſſeſſes the Minds of the <hi>Indolent,</hi> and <hi>Unthinking,</hi>
Part of our Nobility and Gentry, <hi>That by engaging in TRADE they degrade
themſelves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0199100802:233"/> YOU will eaſily prove the
<hi>contrary,</hi> ſince not only our <hi>Credit</hi> at Home, but our
<hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Abroad, is ſupported by it. Beſides which, the Education,
neceſſary to qualify a Man for a compleat <hi>Trader,</hi> is ſuch, as
becomes a Gentleman of the firſt Rank. For he ſhould be a Proficient in
<hi>Languages, Hiſtory, Geography,</hi> and <hi>Mathematicks:</hi> And, in
order to be Maſter of the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which may be made, in every Soil,
and Climate, he ſhould know ſomething of <hi>Natural
Philoſophy.</hi>—He ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Policy</hi>
and <hi>Government,</hi> of all Nations: And, though he does not immediately
concern himſelf in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of <hi>State Affairs,</hi> yet he ſhould
be <hi>qualified</hi> for a <hi>PRIME MINISTER.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> OUR Youth of <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Gaiety,</hi> are generally
taken with the Character of a <hi>SOLDIER</hi>; and it muſt be allowed, a
<hi>Noble Employment,</hi>—Eſpecially, when aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in the Defence
of our Country. But then, it may be remembred, That the Art of <hi>War,</hi>
was introduced thro' the <hi>Corruption</hi> of Mankind, and is always attended
with <hi>Ruin</hi> and <hi>Deſolation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> OTHERS, who would appear more polite than their Neighbours,
breed up their Sons to practice the <hi>LAW,</hi>—but I am ſorry to
ſay, that <hi>This,</hi> conſidered as a <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> is is
attended with Conſequencs, as Fatal to Families, as <hi>That</hi> is to
Nations.—For, <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0199100802:234"/> though our <hi>Seats</hi> of
<hi>Juſtice</hi> are filled with Men, from whom we may expect All, that is
equal and juſt; yet by the <hi>Turns,</hi> and <hi>Managements,</hi> of the
inferiour Practicers in thoſe Courts, our Approach to Them, is made ſo
<hi>Intricate</hi> and <hi>Expenſive,</hi> that they who are obliged to ſue
for their own Right, in the common Forms, are frequently <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> even
though they obtain the <hi>Verdict,</hi> in their <hi>Favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> THUS the Properties of the People are render'd precarious, and
many Difficulties are put upon them, in their Purſuit of <hi>Juſtice,</hi>
by thoſe, who pervert the true <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>; and
make That a dark <hi>Myſtery,</hi> which being the Rule of every Man's
Actions, <hi>ſhould lie open, and plain to his Underſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> AND, here, I cannot help mentioning a Thing, which, though it
ſeems but a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle, much be allowed to look like a very unreaſonable
Hardſhip.—The Manner of making out, and ſerving a <hi>Subpoena</hi>
in <hi>Chancery!</hi>—This is a ſmall Slip of Parchment, roll'd up, in
a Lump of Wax, and may chance to be ſerv'd, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, upon a Perſon,
who can hardly read the plaineſt <hi>Engliſh:</hi>—When it comes to
his Hands, perhaps, at firſt, he is <hi>affraid to break it open</hi>; but,
if he proves <hi>hardy</hi> enough to do that, he is not one Jot the wiſer;
for it is wrote in <hi>Barbarous Latin,</hi> with odd unintelligble,
<hi>Abbreviations</hi>; and, in a <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0199100802:235"/> Hand, more
reſembling a Set of <hi>Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,</hi> than the Letters of a
<hi>Chriſtian Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> THE poor Man, thinking no Harm, lays it by, till his
Convenience ſerves him, to get it <hi>explained,</hi> by the firſt
<hi>Great Scholar</hi> he happens to meet with. But, in the mean Time, upon
this Delay, out comes an <hi>Attachment,</hi> and ſo on, to a <hi>Writ</hi>
of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>; for no other Reaſon than that a Man who was bred to
underſtand nothing but <hi>Husbandry,</hi> could not decypher a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
ſerved upon him, in a <hi>Language</hi> he never heard of, and a
<hi>Character,</hi> which the Parſon of the Pariſh, might himſelf, have
been equally puzzled by!</p>
                  <p> THERE are many other Proceedings in the <hi>Law,</hi> of a like
Nature, which if truly conſidered, have methinks, but an <hi>odd</hi>
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, in a Country of ſo much <hi>boaſted Liberty.</hi>—But
if, while we cenſure, what ſeems thus unreaſonable, in the Method of
ſome of our <hi>Law-Practices,</hi> it ſhould be alledged, That,
Notwithſtanding all this, it has produced many Great, and Uſeful Men, <hi>I
allow it,</hi>—only it may be worth conſidering, Whether we have not
more Reaſon to be <hi>aſhamed we ſtand in need of them,</hi> than to
boaſt that we <hi>have them.</hi> And I will ask this plain Queſtion, If
that would not be eſteemed a <hi>happier Climate,</hi> where there is no Need
of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> than where the Uncertainty, or Unwholeſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs 
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0199100802:236"/> of the Air has encourag'd ſo many of them to ſettle,
that you are ſure of finding a Good One in every Street?</p>
                  <p> I BEG Pardon for this Digreſſion; but I was led into it by
mentioning the <hi>Law</hi> as a <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> compared with that of
the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> in order to engage your more able Pen to ſhow, at
large, how much <hi>One</hi> is preferrable to the <hi>other</hi>; as well with
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>Honour,</hi> as the <hi>Uſefulneſs,</hi> that attends
it—ſince All, who raiſe their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes meerly by the Practice of the
<hi>Law,</hi> or the Succeſs of the <hi>Sword,</hi> muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
do it upon the <hi>Ruin</hi> of <hi>Families</hi> and <hi>Nations:</hi> Whereas
the Generous <hi>TRADER,</hi> while he enriches <hi>himſelf,</hi> is
ſpreading Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to all about him: From whence we may infer, That
<hi>This</hi> is the Employment, moſt agreeable to the <hi>Original
Deſign</hi> of our <hi>Beings,</hi> which was, not to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> but
to <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>cheriſh</hi> each other.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>MOSES</hi> was a great <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> and
<hi>David</hi> was a <hi>Warriour:</hi> But <hi>SOLOMON,</hi> whom GOD was
pleaſed to honour, with ſtill ſublimer Marks of his Favour, and to whom
He gave the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Heart;—So that there was none like him, BEFORE, neither ſhould Any
riſe, AFTER, like unto him.</hi> This <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Greateſt King,
the Choſen People of GOD ever had! was a <hi>MERCHANT</hi>; and ſent
Fleets, by way of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> to bring home <hi>Gold,</hi> from the
<hi>Eaſt Indies:</hi> And <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0199100802:237"/> what <hi>Noble
Monuments</hi> did this Prince leave behind him of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and
his <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> BUT we have a living Example in the <hi>CZAR,</hi> a Prince,
who has done more for the Advantage of his Country, and his own Glory, by
encouraing <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> and improving every Branch of
<hi>Trade,</hi> in his Dominions, than by all the <hi>Battles</hi> he has ever
fought.—In fine, <hi>who</hi> has not obſerv'd, That <hi>our own moſt

            <p>I AM perfectly in the Sentiments of the Ingenious Gentleman, who
ſent me the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Letter;—But, the Subject which he has
recommended, can never hope to ſucceed better, than under the Care of ſo
able a Hand, as his own: And, for that Reaſon, I am very deſirous of the
Continuance of his Correſpondence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0199100802:238"/>THE Opinion, That <hi>Merchandizing
deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Blood,</hi> is a Folly, worthy only of the <hi>Tribe,</hi> to whom
this Gentleman imputes it.—It is a Truth, too well known, that the
INDOLENT and UNTHINKING, <hi>Part,</hi> of our <hi>Nobility</hi> and
<hi>Gentry,</hi> is a very <hi>large</hi> Part of them: But (Heaven be
prais'd!) not at all a <hi>conſiderable One.</hi>—They are a Race of
<hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Creatures,</hi> who had the Honour to be born, for their
<hi>own Eaſe</hi>; but for the <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment</hi> of other
People.—They put me in mind of the Innkeeper in the STRATAGEM, who was
able <hi>at preſent,</hi> to produce none of the <hi>Good Things,</hi> his
Gueſts wanted, but had the Satisfaction of, remembring that he could have
furniſh'd 'em, All, <hi>if they had din'd with him, laſt SUNDAY:—No
Matter how pur-blind</hi> a Man of <hi>Quality</hi> happens to be, ſince he
had a <hi>Great Grandfather,</hi> that was <hi>ſharp ſighted!</hi> He may
<hi>be, a Fool too,</hi> (HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF)—but it ought to be <hi>Scandalum
Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum</hi> to laugh at him.—For he has <hi>Proofs,</hi> in the
<hi>Herald's Office,</hi> That his FOREFATHERS cou'd <hi>act wiſely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have the Comfort, however, to know, that <hi>All</hi> our
<hi>Lords,</hi> are not LORDS OF TRADE: If they <hi>were,</hi> my
Correſpondent's Excellent Notions might be urg'd, with an Effect, but
ill-proportion'd to their Value; and fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Noble Eye</hi> of not
a Few able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, of the ſame Stamp with a famous One, in a late
Reign, who, when a certain Knight, a Great Trader, preſented him with a
<hi>Scheme</hi> 
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0199100802:239"/> 
               <hi>for the Improvement of
Commerce,</hi> threw it back to him, with a <hi>wiſe Contempt,</hi> and ask'd
him, <hi>Whether he thought, that Men of HIS QUALITY, had nothing to do but to
read Papers!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO the juſt, and lively, Obſervation, <hi>That a Merchant
ought to be qualify'd for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State,</hi> I will add this Wiſh,
of my own,—That we may, never have a <hi>Miniſter of State,</hi> who is
not <hi>qualified for a Merchant!</hi>—Not <hi>Trade</hi> alone, but
<hi>Politicks,</hi> would ſoon feel the Benefit of ſo <hi>new</hi> a
Regulation.—Yet, there is a Happineſs, <hi>ſtill greater</hi>; and it
is the <hi>Laſt,</hi> the <hi>warmeſt, Hope,</hi> of thoſe, to whoſe
ſucceſsful Induſtry we owe our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce!—That the Way might
always lie open, to the Ear of our Princes Themſelves,</hi> without
paſſing the <hi>narrow Poſterns,</hi> which <hi>Truth</hi> is often
oblig'd to <hi>wait at,</hi> 'till it has wearied it ſelf, to no

            <p>THE Firſt remarkable <hi>Start,</hi> in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the
<hi>Engliſh Traffick,</hi> was made in the Reign of our High-ſpirited
<hi>Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth:</hi> And to what Kind of Meaſures it was owing, may, I
preſume, be gather'd, without much Difficulty, from the following little
Story, which I have taken out of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Diſcourſe,
concerning the <hi>Prerogative of Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <q> QUEEN <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would ſet the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of her
<hi>meaneſt Subject,</hi> againſt the <hi>Authority</hi> of her
<hi>greateſt Councellor.</hi> By her Patience, <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0199100802:240"/> herein,
ſhe raiſed the ordinary <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> above
<hi>Fifty thouſand Pounds a Year,</hi> without any new
Impoſition.—The Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Walſingham</hi> (All <hi>Three
PENSIONERS</hi> to Cuſtomer <hi>Smith)</hi> join'd, to ſet themſelves
againſt a poor <hi>Waiter</hi> of the Cuſtom-Houſe, call'd
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden</hi>; and commanded the Grooms of the Chamber not to give him
Admiſſion.—But the Queen, ſent for him, on a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he
deliver'd, into her Hands, and gave him Countenance <hi>againſt them
all.</hi>—It would not ſerve the Turn <hi>with Her,</hi> to be told by
her Great Officers, that ſhe <hi>diſgrac'd Them,</hi> by allowing her Ear
to the Complaints of <hi>buſie Heads</hi>; and that ſhe diſhonour'd Her
<hi>own Dignity.</hi>—She had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways This, to anſwer—<hi>That,

               <p> WHERE am I? What am I doing? What am I deſigning?—I am
haſtening already to the <hi>End</hi> of my <hi>Life</hi>; and have hardly
ſo much as thought upon the <hi>End</hi> of my <hi>Being!</hi>—I am
tranſported with That which I am not ſure to poſſeſs, <hi>a Day</hi>;
and neglect to acquaint myſelf with what I muſt carry with me, <hi>thro'
Eternity!—Age</hi> has, naturally, a Power to afflict, and mortifie, the
<hi>Body:</hi> Let it now exert a <hi>nobler Influence,</hi> and
<hi>exalt,</hi> and <hi>quicken,</hi> my <hi>Spirit!</hi>—Summon, O my
Soul, thy ſtray'd, and degenerate, Thoughts; Know the Dignity of thy
Condition; and let nothing proceed from Thee, but what may, truly, be worthy of
Thee.</p> 
               <p> I FEAR, if I make a Scrutiny into the Conduct of my Life, I
ſhall diſgrace my bluſhing <hi>Reaſon,</hi> by a Recollection of my
<hi>Vanity.</hi>—The Tenderneſs of my <hi>Infant Years</hi> was too
weak to afford Matter, that cou'd merit my <hi>Age's</hi> Notice; and yet, the
<hi>Tears,</hi> methinks, which it was ſubject to, might have forewarned me,
That I was ent'ring upon a <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> of <hi>Miſery!</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> IN the <hi>Boyiſh</hi> Years, which ſucceeded
<hi>Childhood,</hi> I drew in Pleaſure, at my Eyes, and Ears; and gave my
Soul a <hi>Tincture</hi> that prepared it for the Impreſſions of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Levity.—<hi>Riches, Honour,</hi> and <hi>worldly Greatneſs,</hi>
glitter'd on me, from a lovely <hi>Diſtance:</hi> And <hi>Retirement,</hi>
when I <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0199100802:244"/> heard it talk'd of, ſeem'd <hi>Stupidity</hi>
or <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>—Theſe Conceptions gather'd Strength, as I
advanced into riper Life, from the <hi>Common Conſent,</hi> of all Men, to
practiſe, and to praiſe, as I did: And <hi>That moſt</hi> among Thoſe,
who were reputed <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> and <hi>moſt happy.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> AT my Entrance into <hi>Youth,</hi> I applied myſelf to
<hi>Study.</hi>—I delighted, chiefly, in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and
<hi>Philoſophy</hi>; and, having the good Fortune to meet with Excellent
Maſters, I made a ſwift, and unuſual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.—Yet I cannot help
confeſſing, That it added Fuel to my native Pride. It inflam'd me with a
<hi>Thirſt</hi> of <hi>Praiſe</hi>; and ſerv'd to countenance that
<hi>Self-Love,</hi> which ſtood in need of no
<hi>Incentive.</hi>—Knowledge is apt to <hi>puff up</hi> its
Poſſeſſors.—I dare not ſay, I poſſeſs'd it: But, if I
ſhould be ask'd, <hi>What Fruit, I reap'd, by my Studies?</hi> I think, I
might venture to anſwer, <hi>That Philoſophy, if it did not</hi> teach
<hi>me</hi> TRUTH, <hi>awaken'd, and prepar'd me, to receive it.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> FOR a while, I was very Earneſt in the Study of
<hi>Morality</hi>; and delighted in it ſo much, that I publiſh'd a
Treatiſe, on that Subject: And, afterwards, when I was come to Man's
Eſtate, I compos'd, in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to my Father's particular Command, an
Elaborate <hi>Hiſtory, of my Country.</hi>—But, while I labour'd to
contribute toward the Glory of other Men, I pleas'd myſelf 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0199100802:245"/> with a flattering Proſpect, That I too, by thoſe my
Labours, ſhould have a Place, in the Temple I was building; and, live, in my
<hi>Fame,</hi> many Ages after my <hi>Death.</hi> Abſurd Extravagance of
<hi>erring Vanity!</hi>—As if, what is <hi>nothing,</hi> in
<hi>Itſelf,</hi> could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> from the Opinions of
Others!</p> 
               <p> NEXT, I gave myſelf wholly up to the Service, and
<hi>Government</hi> of my Country; and found my Way ſo plain, and eaſy,
that I ſoon attain'd Great Honours, and helped to fill the <hi>foremoſt
Employments.</hi>—But, alas! What <hi>Boaſt</hi> is
<hi>This?</hi>—Am I not ſenſible, that not only the moſt
<hi>buſy,</hi> but even the moſt <hi>pleaſing,</hi> of my preſent
Thoughts, will vaniſh, like a ſilent Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow?—All theſe Dignities,
and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, theſe <hi>State Buſtles,</hi> and
<hi>Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> with which my Mind is, ſo <hi>gloriouſly
incumber'd,</hi> will diſſolve, <hi>like Smoak into the Wind!</hi> or be
wither'd, like <hi>Flowers,</hi> by the Beams of that <hi>Sun,</hi> which
cheriſh'd them!—Yet, unſtable as theſe <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms</hi> are,
and as I <hi>know</hi> them to be, I muſt meditate on <hi>Them only.</hi> My
Thoughts, however reluctant, muſt, at all Times, and in all Places, give way
to the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Importance of theſe proud <hi>Chimera's</hi>; and abandon
the Contemplation of Things <hi>intrinſically Noble.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> ALAS! how hard it is to ſerve <hi>Two Maſters,</hi> of
oppoſite Meanings! my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> 
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0199100802:246"/> and my
<hi>Pride,</hi> ſeem to have divided me, between them.—<hi>Pride</hi>
teaches me to meaſure my Actions, with Regard only to <hi>outward
Appearances,</hi> by which Men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſeem</hi> happy, than <hi>are</hi>
ſo.—But <hi>Reaſon</hi> is always whiſpering me, that
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Humility, Mediocrity,</hi> and <hi>Self-denial,</hi> are the
Roads, which lead to <hi>Felicity.</hi>—As I approached to <hi>Old
Age,</hi> I grew, more and more, ſenſible on which of theſe Two Sides
<hi>Truth</hi> lay: But I perſiſted, even againſt Conviction, and
ſacrific'd my <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Reſt,</hi> to <hi>Careful Power,</hi>
and <hi>Splendid Miſery.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> WHAT, then, do I <hi>wiſh?</hi>—What is it, that I am
<hi>expecting?</hi>—If I know, that my Purſuits are <hi>Follies,</hi>
what hinders but that I <hi>change</hi> them?—If, after having waſted
the Vigour of my Life, without Advantage from ſuch Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I am leſs
ſatisfied than when I <hi>began</hi> to <hi>live,</hi> Am I weak enough to
hope, That, while, <hi>I, myſelf, do not change, the very Nature of Things
ſhou'd alter?</hi> Shall <hi>Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> turn to <hi>Delight,</hi>
becauſe I am fondly <hi>in Love with Pleaſure?</hi>—Or ſhall a
World, that produces nothing but <hi>Cares,</hi> be taught hereafter to abound
with <hi>Comforts,</hi> That I only may be <hi>indulg'd,</hi> with new, and
unnatural, <hi>Satisfaction?</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> LOOK out, my Soul, upon theſe <hi>Ruins,</hi> that are every
where ſpread round thee! This was, once, That <hi>aweful</hi> ROME! The

<hi>unbounded Influence?</hi> Where the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of her
<hi>Empire?</hi> Where are Her <hi>Treaſures?</hi> Her <hi>Triumphs?</hi> and
the dreadful Conſequences of a <hi>Thouſand Victories?</hi>—Are they
not the Prey of <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Time?</hi> Do they not lie
<hi>buried,</hi> in theſe Heaps of <hi>Ruin?</hi>—And ſhalt
<hi>Thou</hi> be fond of <hi>Glory?—Thou,</hi> who canſt look down with
<hi>Pity,</hi> on the Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a <hi>Power,</hi> that drew a Chain
about the World;—Shalt <hi>Thou</hi> preſume to pride Thyſelf in
<hi>Honours,</hi> or <hi>Diſtinctions?</hi> or grow <hi>vain,</hi> upon the
<hi>little Preference</hi> of a light, and momentary, Dignity!</p> 
               <p> No,—Thou, who haſt <hi>Duration,</hi> and
<hi>Stability!</hi> Thou! who ſhalt endure, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſting,</hi> thro' the
<hi>Changes</hi> of <hi>Eternity!</hi> conſider better the true <hi>Rate</hi>
of <hi>Things</hi>; and proportion thy Deſire to their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.—If they
are not of <hi>Real Worth,</hi> why then, haſt Thou <hi>lov'd</hi>
them?—Why endeavour'ſt Thou to <hi>retain</hi> them? Why art Thou
<hi>ſhaken</hi> at a Proſpect of thy <hi>loſing</hi> them?—Or,
grant they have, in them, any Thing, that may be call'd a <hi>Real Good,</hi>
why, at leaſt, is it not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd, <hi>For how ſhort a Time thou canſt
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them?</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> A THOUSAND Ways, theſe <hi>worldly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi> have it, in
their very <hi>Nature,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us.—While we ſuppoſe their
<hi>Increaſe</hi> the only Means to make us <hi>happy</hi>; 
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0199100802:248"/> we, inſenſibly, become <hi>miſerable:</hi> For we
fix our Minds, ſo intently, upon the <hi>Little we, yet, want,</hi> that we
continue <hi>Dead</hi> to the Enjoyment of All that we were before
poſſeſſed of.—The Fear of <hi>loſing,</hi> what we have already
got, has a Power to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh</hi> vulgar Minds, as effectually as if
they really <hi>poſſeſſed Nothing!</hi> And a greater Vexation than
This, the Humane Soul is not capable of being tormented by—Becauſe, as
the Miſery is <hi>imaginary,</hi> it is <hi>boundleſs</hi>; and, as it drew
its Evil from <hi>Depravity,</hi> it can receive no <hi>Cure</hi> from
<hi>Reaſon.</hi>—Strange Perverſeneſs of our Nature!—We have
our <hi>Happineſs, within ourſelves,</hi> and are always ſeeking it
<hi>abroad:</hi>—We have our <hi>Miſeries, remote, and without</hi>;
and, yet, are, for ever, <hi>ſmarting inward</hi>; and tranſplanting
Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ourſelves, which have no <hi>Roots,</hi> but in our Diligence,
to <hi>excite,</hi> and <hi>nouriſh,</hi> our own Miſchiefs!</p> 
               <p> IF we <hi>feed</hi> the Soul with Meat, which is not
<hi>proper</hi> to her Nature, what Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſhe <hi>pines,</hi> and can
never be <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied?</hi>—But, I perceive, while I <hi>praiſe
MARY,</hi> I am <hi>imitating MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THA.</hi>—I diſcern the
<hi>right</hi> Way; But I chuſe to travel in the <hi>wrong,</hi> till I have
loſt my ſelf in its intricate Windings!—I am troubled, and
<hi>buſied with many Things</hi>; tho' I know, well enough, that there is but

an Affection, and Partiality, for them.—The Love and Gratitude, I owe my
<hi>Friends.</hi>—The Hopes, and Fears, and touching Tenderneſs, with
which I think of my <hi>Wife,</hi> and <hi>Children;—Domeſtick,</hi>
and private <hi>Oeconomy</hi>; and the weightier Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the

Politeſt of the <hi>Claſſicks,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a commendable
<hi>Outſet.</hi> But to be taught, a greater Admiration of them, than of the
<hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Inſpir'd Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> is an <hi>Extream</hi>;
and one, that is, more than ordinary <hi>Criminal.</hi>—How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0199100802:252"/> is it, to hear Perſons expreſſing their utmoſt
Fondneſs for the Former, whilſt the Laſt is ſeldom mentioned; or,
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, with much <hi>Indifference.</hi> There are <hi>ſublime</hi>
Sentiments in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors;—But there is
ſomething, too, which, I cannot forbear to take Notice of, that their
<hi>Characters</hi> were ſeldom ſuitable;—One Proof of which
Aſſertion, we may borrow from <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Life of <hi>Cato</hi>;
Even that <hi>Cato</hi> who was famous for the rigid Stubbornneſs of his
Morality!—When his Domeſticks were worn out with hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or grown
paſt it, through Encreaſe of Age, he would diſmiſs them, and ſhow no
Tokens of further Regard or Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: On which <hi>Plutarch</hi> has left us
this Reflection, <hi>That we are not to uſe unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Wretches, who depend
on us; as we do our</hi> old Shooes, <hi>or</hi> Platters, <hi>and throw them
away, when they are</hi> broken, <hi>and fall to Pieces in our
Service:</hi>—But if it were for nothing better than to expreſs the
Reſpect, we have for the <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> a Man ought always to
cheriſh in himſelf a kind and compaſſionate Diſpoſition.</p> 
               <p> BUT, not to digreſs farther, There are <hi>infinitely
Sublimer</hi> Sentiments in the <hi>Sacred Writings,</hi> and the Lives of
their Authors ſhone, illuſtrious Examples of their Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine!—How
becoming a great Soul, is, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,
Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord</hi>—<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0199100802:253"/> Again,
<hi>What? ſhall we receive Good at the Hand of God, and ſhall we not
receive Evil?</hi>—How Happy would it be for Mankind? if they would feel,
and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, to their Practice, the glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our Redeemer, <hi>To
do nothing, but as we would be done by</hi>; to exerciſe our Benignity even
towards thoſe, who <hi>hate,</hi> and who <hi>perſecute</hi> us! This
Propoſition is contemned by too many, tho' we have it ſo ſtrongly
recommended, not only by the <hi>Words,</hi> but by the <hi>Practice</hi> of
Him, who <hi>died</hi> for our Salvation! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, (as you have obſerv'd
in one of your PLAIN DEALERS) a Return of <hi>Good Offices,</hi> for
<hi>Injuries,</hi> is, indeed, the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Revenge</hi>; For by
ſuch a Conduct, we triumph over, confound, and diſgrace, a malicious Enemy:
As by a contrary Management, we ſeem to <hi>juſtify,</hi> as well as
<hi>inflame</hi> him.</p> 
               <p> IN Fine, There are a beautiful Variety of Inſtructions, in Holy
Writ, which can never be parallell'd; They manifeſt their Heavenly Original;
And, if we make 'em our Delight, will alleviate all earthly Calamity, and
furniſh an infallible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, for every Accident, that can befal Us. I
deſign'd now to have ended; but Recollecting, that there are ſome, who have
little <hi>Faith,</hi> in <hi>Revelation,</hi> I'll go on, a Line or two
farther;—Suppoſe, we grant their <hi>inconſiſtent
Hypotheſis:</hi> Yet, <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0199100802:254"/> ſtill, it is our Intereſt to
direct ourſelves, by the Meaſures of <hi>Revealed Religion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is the trueſt Friend to humane Nature, and promotes nothing which is not
conducive to our Quiet, and Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that, allowing it were not our
<hi>Duty,</hi> it is, however our <hi>Prudence,</hi> to comply with ſo
excellent, and even ſo <hi>agreeable a Model.</hi>

            <p>SO far, I have entertain'd my Readers with ſome Reflexions, for

been written; with leſs Effect than might reaſonably have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,

and flat, obſolete, <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> of the <hi>coarſe

Whether, ſince they are ſatisfied, That there is a Neceſſity for a

they ought to remain contented with the <hi>Vile Verſions,</hi> now in Uſe,
and ſuffer the moſt lofty, and moſt pathetick Idea's of

there is a Similitude, between <hi>His</hi> manner of <hi>Thinking,</hi> and
that of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and others of the <hi>Hebrew

immortal <hi>Greek,</hi> may gather ſome New Force if we conſider
<hi>Homer</hi>'s Deſcription of a Tempeſt, which <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi> was
ſo juſtly charm'd with, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with that of <hi>David,</hi> in the

                  <p> THE Ship <hi>Bouevia,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
about 250 Tun, Captain <hi>Brooks,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; ſet ſail, from the
Coaſt of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on the 25th of <hi>November</hi> laſt; having
two Pilots, one <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the other <hi>Dutch:</hi> And his
<hi>Wife</hi> was on board, with him.</p>
                  <p> THE Day had been fair, and clear; but, in the Evening, about
Six, it blew hard at South and by Weſt. The Gale increas'd, into a violent
Storm, and continu'd for about Seven Hours, veering to the Weſt, and North
and by Weſt: During which the Ship was <hi>ſtranded,</hi> off of
<hi>Enchuyſen,</hi> in the <hi>Texel.</hi>

                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0199100802:265"/> IN order to ſave themſelves, if
poſſible, the Men all got into the Long-Boat, and were juſt ready to put
off: But, not having their Captain among them, they call'd to him to haſten
down; becauſe the Sea ran ſo high, that it broke over the Boat, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd her beating to Pieces, againſt the Side of the ſtranded
Veſſel.—The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in this nice, and perilous, Point of Time,
recollecting that his Wife was Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, in the Cabin, cou'd not bear the
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Thought of endeavouring to ſave himſelf, without her, and was
earneſtly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to bring her along with him.—But, ſhe, who had
heard the Men cry out, That the Boat wou'd ſink, under the weight of two
Perſons more, embrac'd him paſſionately, and refus'd to go.—She
wept, and told him, in the moſt moving man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, That a <hi>Woman,</hi> in
ſuch an Extremity, wou'd prove a <hi>dangerous Incumbrance.</hi> She implor'd
him not to think of <hi>dividing</hi> his Care; but to employ it all for
Preſervation of his ſingle Life, much dearer to her, than <hi>her own
was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> FOR ſome Time, he preſs'd her, in <hi>vain</hi>; but
prevail'd with her, at length, to come up with him upon Deck; where the firſt
Obſervation they made, was, <hi>That the Boat was out of Sight</hi>; having
been beaten off, by the Force of the <hi>Swell,</hi> that roſe between her
and the Veſſel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0199100802:266"/> HE was Gazing, Speechleſs, on her Face,
in a Deſpair, which he found no <hi>Words</hi> to <hi>utter,</hi> when a
Billow, breaking over the Midſhip, waſh'd him headlong, into the Sea; and
left <hi>her,</hi> ſhrieking, and alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, in a Condition ſo far
<hi>leſs ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than his,</hi> that, after a Succeſſion of the
bittereſt <hi>Out-cries,</hi> ſhe fell forward, in a Swoon, and ſunk
ſenſleſs after him.</p>
                  <p> THE Boat, in the mean Time, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to return to the Ship;
and paſſing, providentially near their Captain, who was yet faintly
Swimming, the Men diſcern'd him, in the Sea, and took him up quite Spent, and
Speechleſs: In which Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they laid him in the Bottom of the Boat; and
coming along the Ship's Side, one of the Sailors looking up, ſaw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like a Woman, with her Arms and Cloaths, entangled in the <hi>Shrouds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> THIS Woman was the <hi>Captain's Wife</hi>; who, in the Moment
of her falling forward, had been ſav'd and ſupported againſt that Part of
the <hi>Rigging!</hi>—She was ſtill in a Swoon, and
<hi>inſenſible</hi>; but ſo beloved by the Mariners, that they redoubled
their Efforts to get Aboard, that they might have it in their Power to ſave
her; And they were ſo <hi>Fortunate,</hi> in their Humanity, that they found
Means to lift her into the Boat: Where they laid her, <hi>Dead in all
Appearance,</hi> by her Husband, who was in the ſame Condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0199100802:267"/> THEY put off, again; and, with great
Difficulty, got aſhore, upon one of the Iſlands in the <hi>Texel</hi>;
where the Captain, coming to himſelf, told his Men, That they wou'd have done
more kindly, had they let him periſh in the Sea; ſince the Life, they had
forc'd upon him, muſt for ever be <hi>imbitter'd,</hi> by the Memory of
<hi>Her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy End,</hi> for whoſe Sake only, He had thought it worth
wiſhing for.—His Wife, was now recovering; and near enough to
<hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>anſwer,</hi> this noble Inſtance of his
Tenderneſs.—They flew, aſtoniſh'd, and quite loſt in Exſtacy,
into each other's Arms—And it is eaſier to <hi>imagine,</hi> than
<hi>deſcribe,</hi> what they <hi>thought,</hi> and <hi>ſaid,</hi> on ſo
tranſporting an Occaſion!</p>

that lately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, upon the Heels of one another.—Amongſt many
<hi>Neighbours in the Country,</hi> I can boaſt but of one <hi>Friend,</hi>
with whom I live in the greateſt Intimacy.—He was one Day at Dinner
with me, and ſaid, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, in a laughing way, That there might
poſſibly be <hi>other Faults</hi> in a <hi>Wife,</hi> as inſupportable as
<hi>Adultery:</hi> At this, my <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s <hi>Chaſtity</hi> flew
out, at her Mouth, and Eyes.—<hi>The Spirit of Honeſty came</hi> 
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0199100802:270"/> 
                     <hi>upon her,</hi> and ſhe threw the Spoons, and
Salts, at his Head, till her <hi>Vertue remain'd Triumphant,</hi> and ſhe had
driven her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt from Table.</p>
                  <p> WHILE this Storm was in the Air, there cou'd be little Quiet
under its Influences; ſo, I judiciouſly retir'd to a Farm-houſe; where I
had been recovering my ſelf, about a Week, when a Meſſenger came with
Tydings, That my ſpotleſs Spouſe, having heard, as Ill-luck wou'd have
it, that the Nurſe to my only Child was a Baſtard, had turn'd her away, at
a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute's Warning, and kill'd the Child, in Three Days after, by
perſiſting in a Reſolu- to <hi>wean</hi> it, from a Milk of ſo
<hi>wicked an Original!</hi> Upon this melancholly Account, I hurried Home,
where I had the Comfort to be convinc'd, that I ought, by no Means, to be

attone for the <hi>Loſs of his Friend:</hi> And that her <hi>Chaſtity</hi>
is the worſt Remedy, ſhe cou'd have thought on, to ſupply the Loſs of a
<hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Heir.</hi>—Nay, if ſhe ſhou'd not believe me, I
am determin'd (if you think there may be no <hi>Danger</hi> in it) to let her
alone to try the Experiment.</p>

            <p>INSTEAD of complying with the Requeſt of my Correſpondent, and
coming in, to his Aſſiſtance, againſt ſo <hi>impenetrable</hi> a
Champio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I ſhall add to his Complaint, as juſt a one of my
own.—<hi>That I, too, loſe my Reſt, by</hi> WOMEN.—What they
<hi>do,</hi> or what they <hi>ſuffer,</hi> is for ever invading, and
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming, my Purpoſes.—Their <hi>Charms,</hi>

Town, and Country.—The <hi>Poſt groans</hi> as we do, under the Burthen
of their <hi>Vanities.</hi>—But, what I think ought to be reckon'd among
my <hi>Sufferings not deſerv'd,</hi> is,—That it often coſts me a
<hi>Groat,</hi> to read one of their <hi>Secret Hiſtories,</hi> not worth a
<hi>Half-penny.</hi> My Intelligencers, from remote Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, make no manner
of Conſcience in their Correſpondence, with me.—For, while they
<hi>charge</hi> the <hi>Follies</hi> they acquaint me with, upon thoſe to
whom they belong; They take care to charge the <hi>Poſtage</hi> upon a
Perſon, who is <hi>wholly Innocent.</hi>

            <p>I WAS lately in Deſpair of working any Reformation upon
Offenders, who poſſeſs the Power of <hi>bewitching</hi> thoſe who
examine them: But there came to my Hands, ſome Time ſince, a ſhort
Treatiſe, in Manuſcript, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by Seven Ladies, its Authors; who
intitle themſelves <hi>The Order of Angels.</hi> Into this Order, they tell
me, they propoſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all the BELIEVING <hi>Fair,</hi> (which, if they
do, they can never fail of a moſt <hi>comprehenſive</hi>
Eſtabliſhment!) The Buſineſs, they are to be <hi>admitted for,</hi> is,
to learn, it ſeems, to CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEIVE <hi>after a new Manner,</hi> ſo as to be
<hi>brought to Bed of themſelves</hi>; and, by Virtue of ſuch <hi>New

                  <p> IN Return for that Pleaſure with which I have read your
Abridgment of <hi>PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUTA</hi>'s <hi>Soliloquy,</hi> in one of your late
<hi>Papers,</hi> I ſend you an Abſtract from a much more modern Treatiſe,
Intitled, <hi>An Enquiry into the Nature of Society,</hi> wherein the Author
has conſider'd <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> as it is the Effect of our Common
<hi>Self-Love,</hi> in a manner, that is equally new, and delightful; and with
a <hi>Penetration,</hi> as Remarkable as the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry</hi> of his
Images.—In ſhort, His <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions</hi> appear to me ſo full
of Nature, Wit, and Livelineſs, that I believe they cannot fail to give great
Pleaſure to your Readers: And, for that Reaſon, I have tranſcrib'd what
follows, and ſend it you, for their Entertainment.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0199100802:277"/> 
                     <p> THEY (ſays this too near Obſerver) who have never taken
Notice of the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Spruce Mercer,</hi> and a <hi>Young
Lady,</hi> his Cuſtomer, who comes to his Shop, have neglected a Scene of
Life, that is very <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining.</hi>—HIS Buſineſs is, to ſell
as much Silk as he can, at a Price by which he ſhall get what he
propoſes:—As to the <hi>Lady,</hi> what SHE would be at is, to pleaſe
her Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and buy cheaper by a Groat or Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence a Yard, than the Things,
ſhe wants, are commonly ſold at.</p> 
                     <p> FROM the Impreſſion, the Gallantry of our Sex has made
upon her, ſhe imagines, That ſhe has a fine <hi>Mein,</hi> and eaſie
<hi>Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> and a <hi>peculiar Sweetneſs</hi> of
<hi>Voice:</hi>—That ſhe is <hi>handſome</hi>; and, if not
<hi>beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> at leaſt more <hi>agreeable,</hi> than moſt young
Women ſhe knows.—As ſhe has no Pretenſions, to purchaſe Things
with <hi>leſs Money</hi> than other People, except thoſe, which are built
on her <hi>Good Qualities,</hi> ſo ſhe ſets herſelf off, to the beſt
Advantage her Wit, and Diſcretion, will let her.—The Thoughts of
<hi>Love</hi> are here out of the Caſe: So, on one Hand, ſhe has no Room
for playing the <hi>Tyrant</hi>; and giving herſelf <hi>angry,</hi> or
<hi>peeviſh</hi> Airs; And, on the other, ſhe has more Liberty of
<hi>ſpeaking kindly,</hi> and being <hi>affable,</hi> than ſhe can have, on
almoſt any other Occaſion.—She knows, that Abundance of well-bred
People come to his Shop; and endeavours to render herſelf 
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0199100802:278"/> as <hi>amiable,</hi> as Vertue, and the Rules of
Decency, allow of.</p> 
                     <p> BEFORE her Coach is yet quite ſtopp'd, ſhe is approach'd
by a <hi>Gentleman-like Man,</hi> who has every thing <hi>clean,</hi> and
<hi>faſhionable,</hi> about him: And who, in low Obeiſance, pays her
Homage, and hands her into the Shop.—There, immediately, he ſlips from
her; and through a Bye-Way, that remains viſible, only for half a Moment,
with great Addreſs, <hi>entrenches</hi> himſelf behind the
<hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; whence, <hi>facing</hi> her, with a profound
<hi>Reverence,</hi> he begs the Favour of <hi>knowing her Commands,</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p> LET her ſay, and diſlike, what ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhe
can never be directly <hi>contradicted:</hi> She deals with a Man, in whom,
conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>Patience</hi> is one of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of his
<hi>Trade.</hi> Whatever Trouble ſhe creates, ſhe is ſure to hear nothing
but the moſt <hi>oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Language,</hi> and has always before her a
chearful Countenance, where <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,</hi> ſeem to be
blended with <hi>Good Humour,</hi> and altogether make up an <hi>artificial
Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> more engaging than <hi>untaught Nature</hi> is able to
produce.</p> 
                     <p> WHEN Two Perſons are ſo well met, the Converſation
muſt be very agreeable, as well as extreamly mannerly, tho' they talk, about
Trifles. While <hi>ſhe</hi> remains ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolute what to <hi>take, he</hi>
ſeems to be the ſame, in <hi>adviſing</hi> her: But, when once ſhe has
<hi>choſen,</hi> he immediately becomes <hi>poſitive,</hi> 
                        <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0199100802:279"/> That it is the <hi>Beſt of the Sort.</hi> He
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to extol her Fancy; and, the oftener he looks upon it, the more he
<hi>wonders,</hi> that he ſhou'd not, <hi>before</hi> have diſcover'd the
Pre-eminence of it, over any Thing he has in his Shop.—He founds her
Capacity, finds out her Blind-ſide; and, by Fifty little Stratagems, makes
her <hi>overvalue</hi> her own Judgment, as well as the Commodity ſhe wou'd
purchaſe.</p> 
                     <p> THE greateſt Advantage he has over her, lies in the moſt
material Part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between them, the <hi>Debate</hi> about the
<hi>Price</hi>; which <hi>he</hi> knows, to a Farthing, and <hi>ſhe</hi> is
wholly ignorant of: Therefore, he no where more egregiouſly impoſes on her
Underſtanding. But, tho' he has, here, the Liberty of telling what
<hi>Lies</hi> he pleaſes, as to the <hi>Prime Coſt,</hi> and the Money he
has <hi>refus'd,</hi> yet he truſts not to <hi>Them only.</hi> He attacks her
<hi>Vanity,</hi> and makes her <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the moſt <hi>incredible</hi>
Things in the World, concerning <hi>His Weakneſs,</hi> and her own
<hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Abilities.</hi>—He had taken a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (he ſays)
never to part with that Piece, under ſuch a Price.—But ſhe has the
Power of <hi>talking</hi> him out of his Purpoſes. He proteſts, muſt
<hi>loſe</hi> by her; but, ſince ſhe ſeems to <hi>have a Fancy for
it,</hi> and is <hi>reſolv'd</hi> to give no more, rather than diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige a
Lady he has ſo extraordinary a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for, <hi>He will let her have
it.</hi>—Only begs, <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0199100802:280"/> That <hi>another Time</hi>
ſhe won't ſtand ſo hard with him.</p> 
                     <p> IN the mean Time, the Buyer, who <hi>knows, that ſhe is no
Fool;</hi> and has a <hi>volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tongue,</hi> is eaſily perſwaded, that
ſhe has a very winning Way of talking: And, thinking it ſufficient, for the
Sake of <hi>Good-breeding,</hi> to diſown a Senſe of her Merit, in ſome
witty <hi>Repartee,</hi> ſhe ſwallows, very contentedly, the Subſtance of
every Thing he has told her: And the Upſhot is, That with the
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> of having <hi>ſav'd Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence a Yard,</hi> ſhe has
bought her Silk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly at the ſame Price as any Body elſe might have had
it for.</p> 
                     <p> IT is poſſible, that this Lady, for want of being
ſufficiently <hi>flatter'd,</hi> or for a Fault ſhe is pleas'd to find in
his Behaviour; or, perhaps, in the <hi>Tying</hi> of his <hi>Neckcloth</hi>;
or, for ſome other Diſlike, <hi>as Subſtantial,</hi> may be
<hi>loſt</hi>; and her Cuſtom beſtow'd on ſome other of the Fraternity.
But, where many of them live in a Cluſter, It is not eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
which Shop to go to: And the Reaſons, ſome of the Fair-Sex have for their
Choice are often very <hi>whimſical,</hi> and and kept as a <hi>Great
Secret.</hi>—Among the Mercers, a Fair-Dealer muſt keep before his own
Door; and, to draw in random Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers, make uſe of no other Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than an <hi>Obſequious Air</hi>; and a <hi>Bow,</hi> to every well-dreſs'd
Female, that offers to look towards his Shop.</p> 
                     <p>
                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0199100802:281"/> BUT, I have ſeen another Method o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Inviting Cuſtomers,</hi> the
moſt diſtant in the World from what I have been ſpeaking of.—I
mean, that, which is practis'd by the <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> on thoſe, whom, by
their Mien, and Garb, they know to be <hi>no Londoners.</hi>—It is
pleaſant to ſee half a Dozen of theſe <hi>Tritons</hi> ſurround a Man,
whom they never ſaw in their Lives before, and Two of them, who can get
neareſt, clapping Each an Arm over his Neck, hug him, as familiarly, as if he
was their Brother, newly return'd from an <hi>Eaſt-India Voyage:</hi> A Third
lays hold of his Hand,—Another of his Sleeve,—His Coat—the
Buttons of it—or any thing he can come at: While a Fifth, or a Sixth, who
has ſcamper'd twice round him already, without being able to get at him,
plants himſelf directly <hi>before</hi> the Man in <hi>Hold</hi>; and, within
Three Inches of his Noſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting his Rivals with an open-mouth'd Cry,
ſhews him a dreadful Set of large Teeth, and a Remainder of Bread and
Cheeſe, which the Country Man's Arrival had hinder'd him from
ſwallowing.</p> 
                     <p> AT <hi>all This</hi> no Offence is taken. The Peaſant
thinks <hi>they are making much of him</hi>; and, therefore, far from
oppoſing them, he patiently ſuffers himſelf to be puſh'd, or pull'd,
which way they direct.—He has not Delicacy to find Fault with their
<hi>Dirt,</hi> and <hi>Sweat</hi>; for he has been us'd to it, from his Cradle:
And it is no Diſturbance to <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0199100802:282"/> him, to hear half a Score
People, ſome of them at his Ear, and the fartheſt not Five Foot from him,
<hi>bawl out,</hi> as if he was a Hundred Yards diſtant.—He is
conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that he makes no leſs Noiſe, when he is merry,
<hi>Himſelf</hi>; and is ſecretly <hi>pleas'd,</hi> with their boiſterous
Uſage. The hawling, and pulling him about, he conſtrues, as a
<hi>Courtſhip,</hi> which he can <hi>feel,</hi> and <hi>underſtand:</hi>
And he can't help wiſhing them well, for the Eſteem they ſeem to have for
him.</p> 
                     <p> HE loves to be <hi>taken notice of,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires the
<hi>Londoners</hi> for being ſo Earneſt in their Deſires to
<hi>ſerve</hi> him, for the Value of <hi>Threepence:</hi> Whereas, in the
Country, he muſt firſt tell People what he wants, and tho' he lays out
Three or Four Shillings, he has hardly a Word ſpoke to him, unleſs it is in
Anſwer to the Queſtions he is forc'd to ask them! This <hi>Alacrity</hi> in
his Behalf, moves his Gratitude, to all the Watermen, and being unwilling to

                  <p> EVER ſince you have oblig'd the World with your Paper, I have
taken a great deal of Pleaſure in reading it; ſuch juſt
<hi>Sentiments,</hi> and your <hi>peculiar Method</hi> of <hi>Plain
Dealing,</hi> muſt charm the intelligent, and give Satisfaction to every one,
who is ſuſceptible of Tenderneſs and Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p> AMONG the Subjects, which you have curſorily touch'd on,
LOVE, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paſſion, (notwithſtanding your <hi>grand
Climacteric</hi>) ſeems to claim a conſiderable Share in your
Compoſition; elſe, how could you ſo tenderly expreſs your ſelf
concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affair of <hi>Lucinda?</hi> With what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy did you
Diſcourſe! Humanity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in every Word, and I believe it
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the moſt Ardent LOVER, to ſpeak of Love, with greater
<hi>Emotion,</hi> than you did in that Beautiful PLAIN DEALER.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0199100802:286"/> I HAVE for ſome time been <hi>in
Love,</hi> with a Woman, inveſted with all the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which accompliſh the
Sex; And, as I am entirely <hi>devoted</hi> to that Paſſion, when I read
that Paper, of <hi>Lucinda,</hi> I felt within me ſomething <hi>new,</hi>
That argued ſtill, for <hi>Love</hi>; ſomething, ſo natural, ſo moving!
that it was impoſſible for one, in my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to withſtand it.
The Opinion I had already conceiv'd of my <hi>Beautiful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber,</hi>
heighten'd by a growing and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Paſſion, made me a Thouſand times
delight my ſelf with an Imagination, that my <hi>Emilia</hi> reſembled
<hi>Lucinda!</hi> The Love I bear this moſt agreeable Woman, has ſo deeply
rooted it ſelf in my Heart, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Time</hi> nor
<hi>Accident,</hi> can eradicate it.—All my Thoughts center in her, and
when <hi>abſent</hi> from <hi>her,</hi> I have loſt the <hi>Soul,</hi> that
<hi>animates</hi> my <hi>Life,</hi> and my <hi>Mind</hi> is as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<hi>Dead,</hi> as my <hi>Body</hi> will be, when <hi>I am no more,</hi> and
ſhall have learnt the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>forgetting</hi> her.</p>
                  <p> MY Paſſion for this <hi>dear Creature</hi> has been
ſometime <hi>Dormant:</hi> About two Years ago, my Affairs obliged me to go
Abroad, when our Acquaintance was but little cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet, an Infant
Paſſion, even then made me ſolely <hi>her</hi> Admirer: Such <hi>Beauty,
Good-Nature, Wit,</hi> and lively <hi>Converſation,</hi> as are rarely to be
met with in one Perſon, ſo captivated me, that I could think of nothing but
the <hi>dear Emilia.</hi>—When I <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0199100802:287"/> return'd Home, my
Paſſion encreaſed daily, inſomuch, that at this Time I am a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to every Thing in the World, but <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Emilia!</hi> without
<hi>her,</hi> I ſhall be the moſt unhappy Man alive.—I dread the
Thoughts of <hi>her</hi> being <hi>unkind,</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven grant, they may be
groundleſs!—I have declar'd my Paſſion to <hi>her,</hi> and, if I
don't flatter my ſelf, ſhe <hi>appears</hi> to have ſome regard for me;
this you will readily conclude gives me <hi>Hope; but,</hi> alas! <hi>I
fear</hi> too, or I ſhou'd be <hi>no Lover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> OUR Circumſtances are very different, and we ſeem in this
Caſe only, to be <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> in one another; As for my Part, a
<hi>genteel Employment</hi> is the only Fortune I have to truſt to, and
therefore, according to the laudable Cuſtom of <hi>Bargain</hi> and
<hi>Sale,</hi> in the Affair of <hi>Marriage,</hi> I am afraid I have too
<hi>little Plea that Way</hi>; yet, ſhe is entirely at her own Diſpoſal,
and can, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking any Body Leave,</hi> make me the <hi>happieſt
Man on Earth.</hi>—Dear Mr. <hi>Plain Dealer,</hi> as you have been an
Advocate for <hi>Lucinda,</hi> I beg a little of your Aſſiſtance; What
muſt I do? without her I am inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably loſt, and am afraid it may be ſo,
if you don't intervene with your <hi>good Advice</hi>; I beg you to publiſh
this, in your next; it may have ſome Effect on the <hi>dear Emilia</hi>; I am
almoſt perſwaded ſhe does not <hi>hate</hi> me; And, yet when I reflect
on the <hi>merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ways of the World,</hi> I am plung'd into the utmoſt
<hi>Deſpair.</hi>

                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0199100802:288"/> SIR, As you are a Man of Reaſon, make
not <hi>light</hi> of my Condition, but exert your ſelf to
<hi>aſſiſt</hi> me; I am afraid I have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bounds of a Letter,
pray correct the Miſtakes in Senſe. I forget every Thing but the <hi>dear
Emilia.</hi>—Angels <hi>protect</hi> her, and make her <hi>kind!</hi>
Your Advice, how to proceed, will be very grateful, and your publiſhing This,
ſave me a great deal of Confuſion: For ſhe will know it comes from me, by
a Declaration in it, which none elſe can perceive.</p>

            <p>THERE is no Spectacle, more <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> terrible, than
that of a Man, who lies, <hi>expiring</hi> his <hi>Soul,</hi> on his
Death-bed.—To ſee how the Spirits ſhrink inward, and retire to the
Heart; which is beating with convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Anguiſh! while the Hands and Feet,
its moſt <hi>remote</hi> Dependancies, are <hi>firſt incolden'd</hi> to a
<hi>faſhioned</hi> Clay, as if Death <hi>crept in at the Nails,</hi> and
wou'd, by Surprize, from both <hi>Extreams,</hi> make ſure of the <hi>vital

            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Mind</hi> would fain <hi>utter</hi> it ſelf, but the
Organs of the Voice are ſo debilitated, that it <hi>cannot.</hi> The
<hi>Eyes</hi> now ſettle to a dim Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0199100802:289"/> which
but a little before, was as ſwift as the Shoots of Lightning, as nimble as
<hi>Thought,</hi> and as bright as the poliſh'd <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond!</hi> The
<hi>Countenance</hi> (through which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there ſhined a <hi>lovely
Majeſty,</hi> even to the Captivating of admiring Souls, is alter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>frightful Paleneſs,</hi> and the Languor of a ghaſtly
Stillneſs.—The <hi>Tongue</hi> is <hi>ſilent,</hi> which commanded a
Family, nay, perhaps a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>; and kept every Thing in Awe, with the
Importance of its Motion.—The <hi>Form</hi> that was, Yeſterday, ſo
graceful, is now become a Thing ſo full of <hi>Horror,</hi> that
<hi>Children</hi> are afraid to look upon it; and muſt, therefore, be
tranſmitted from its Pleaſures, and its Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,—from all the
Scences of its inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Blandiſhments, to a dark and ſilent
<hi>Grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is even the Difference of <hi>two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Worlds,</hi>
betwixt a King, <hi>enamel'd</hi> with his Robes and Jewels, ſitting in his
Imperial <hi>State</hi>; and his Poſture, Figure and Condition when
conſign'd to his Six Foot of Royalty, to his <hi>Box</hi> of everlaſting
Obſcurity. And yet this <hi>Change</hi> is without any viſible,
ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, <hi>Diminution:</hi> All the <hi>Limbs</hi> remain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as they were, without Diſlocation, or Contraction.—Whence
<hi>Scaliger</hi> defines Death to be but the <hi>Ceſſation of the Soul's
Functions:</hi> As if it were rather a <hi>Reſtraint,</hi> than a
<hi>Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi> What ſeems wanting, is chiefly <hi>Colour,
Heat,</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi>; yet, that groſs Object, which is left to the
Spectator's Eyes, remains <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0199100802:290"/> remains now but a Compound of
the two ignobler Elements, <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>; while the two
purer, <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Air</hi>; are winged away, as fitter Attendants on
the <hi>Soul,</hi> than on the extinguiſh'd <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN this happens to one, whoſe Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation hath indeared
him to us, when we ſee his Eyes <hi>put on Death,</hi> and hear the
<hi>tolling Bell</hi> give publick Notice of it, what Soul can <hi>then</hi>
loſe a Thought on the fugitive Joys of <hi>Pleaſure!</hi> What a
<hi>Bubble,</hi> what a <hi>Puff,</hi> what a <hi>Wink</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> is
Man! And with what a general, and ſure, Succeſs, does Death ſtand over
Humane Nature, always <hi>ſtriking,</hi> here and there, and exerciſing an
unbounded <hi>Triumph!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE, lately, from ſuch a Sight as <hi>This,</hi> learnt both
<hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Elevation:</hi>—The One, to lower my Eſteem
of a <hi>Body,</hi> which muſt, one Day periſh in unlovely
<hi>Rottenneſs.</hi>—The other, to Reverence a <hi>Soul,</hi> which
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having liv'd here but as a <hi>Sojourner,</hi> reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends, when its
Houſe of Fleſh is demoliſh'd, with a Vigour as unreſtrain'd, and an
Eſſence as refin'd and glorious, as the <hi>un-imbodied,</hi> and
coeleſtial, <hi>Angels!</hi>

                  <p> HUMANITY has inſtructed me, That he who lets a <hi>Secret
die</hi> with him, from the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of which the <hi>World</hi>
might receive <hi>Benefit,</hi> is an Enemy to the Good of Mankind, and a
Diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and Misfortune, to his Country.—Phyſicians may boaſt,
as they pleaſe, of the Vertues of their <hi>Simples,</hi> I know a
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,</hi> call'd <hi>Flattery,</hi> that is a better <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi>
than any of 'em.</p>
                  <p> I AM one of Thoſe, whom <hi>Fortune</hi> has the leaſt
Kindneſs in the World for. <hi>This,</hi> however, ſhe did for me.—My
Father Dying, while I was a Child, ſhe put it into my <hi>Uncle's</hi> Head
to take Care of me; and he ſent me to the <hi>Univerſity</hi>; where I have
now been (at <hi>his</hi> Charge) about two Years, and a half.—I come up
to <hi>London,</hi> every <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> to paſs a Month at my
<hi>Uncle's,</hi> who is a Rich Merchant, in the <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0199100802:293"/>
                     <hi>City</hi>; and give him an <hi>Account,</hi> as he calls it, what I have
<hi>learnt,</hi> during the other Eleven. His <hi>Education</hi> has tinctur'd
him with that infallible Mark of a <hi>narrow Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>—The
<hi>Deſtroying Half the Merit of his Purpoſes, by an ungraceful Manner of
Executing them.</hi>—And he has ſo often, taken Delight to put me,
coarſely, in mind of his <hi>Charity,</hi> That he <hi>robb'd</hi> me, even
of the <hi>Comfort,</hi> which <hi>He laid out his Money to procure</hi>
me.</p>
                  <p> THIS laſt <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> being ſeiz'd by a violent
Fit of the <hi>Gout</hi>; he was roaring out, one Day, in Extremity of
<hi>Pain,</hi> and <hi>Peeviſhneſs:</hi>—He cou'd not, he ſaid,
<hi>imagine,</hi> how ſo <hi>temperate</hi> a Man, as <hi>He</hi> was,
ſhou'd come by ſuch a Diſtemper as the <hi>Gout!</hi> If he had been a
<hi>Glutton,</hi> or a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> he ſhou'd not have wonder'd at
it!—But, for a <hi>Small-Beer-Drinker!</hi> One, who had always been
<hi>remarkable</hi> for his <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> to fall under the Torture of
<hi>ſuch a Diſeaſe, as the Gout!</hi>—It was very hard!—It
was very ſtrange!—And he cou'd not, <hi>for his Part,</hi> tell, how it
was to be <hi>accounted for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IT was my Good-Luck, at that Time, to have been newly reading a
Collection of <hi>Miſcellaneous Poems</hi>; and I bethought my ſelf of
ſomething, that I met with, in it, which had pleas'd me very much; and made
an Impreſſion on my Memory.—I ran, and fetch'd the Book, and opening 
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0199100802:294"/> it to the Place, put it into my <hi>Uncle</hi>'s Hands,
and told him, He might there, find the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> of that
<hi>Misfortune,</hi> he had been complaining of.—He deſir'd me to read
it to him, and I did it, as follows.</p>

He made me read it ſo often, that he has got it by Heart: And repeats it
Twenty Times a Day, in all Companies, as a Proof of his <hi>Nephew's
Ingenuity.</hi> He never cou'd <hi>abide Poetry:</hi> But, is now grown very
fond of it.—He cou'd not have <hi>believ'd,</hi> he ſays, that there
was <hi>ſo much GOOD REASON in Rhyming.</hi> In fine, I am grown a
<hi>Favourite</hi>; and he allows, <hi>I have a great deal of WIT,</hi> ever
ſince I prov'd his Diſtemper to be the Conſequences of his
<hi>JUDGMENT,</hi> and <hi>profound Thinking.</hi>—I cou'd not forbear

                  <p> THE only Account I ſhall give you, with Regard to
<hi>myſelf,</hi> is,—That I am a <hi>Fellow</hi> of one of the
<hi>Colleges,</hi> in this <hi>Univerſity</hi>; my chief Deſign in Writing,
bing to ſtrengthen you, with ſome <hi>new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials</hi> for the better
Performance of that Promiſe, you were once pleas'd to make us, of
<hi>proving,</hi> that the <hi>Women</hi> are a great deal <hi>wiſer</hi>
than <hi>We are.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> MY Father, very lately, ſent me down, into the <hi>Fens,</hi>
to <hi>make Love</hi> to a young Lady, who is Miſtreſs of a conſiderable
Fortune: Where I diſcover'd, to my no ſmall Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, That All my
<hi>Learning,</hi> hitherto, has <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0199100802:302"/> taught me Nothing, that
deſerves Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, with the <hi>Univerſal Knowledge,</hi> which I met
with, in that diſcreet, and profound, Family!—Not <hi>Heaven</hi>
alone, but <hi>Earth, Air, Fire, Water; Birds, Beaſts, Stocks,
Stones!</hi>—Every Part of the ſtill, or moving, mute, or ſpeaking,
<hi>Creation,</hi> has contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Erudition</hi> of my more than
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Miſtreſs!—All Things been <hi>laid open,</hi> to her,
if not in their <hi>Natures,</hi> I am ſure, I may ſay, in their
<hi>Meanings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IN ſhort, after Three Days unſucceſsful Endeavours to
fathom my Fate, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this <hi>infallible</hi> Lady, I am come back
to my College, almoſt too <hi>humble to wiſh for</hi> the
Poſſeſſion of a Bleſſing, ſo <hi>uncommon.</hi>—I ſaw a
<hi>female Dwarf,</hi> in my Miſtreſs's Neighbourhood, and could not help
think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while I was looking on her, and liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a little Hiſtory,
of her having been <hi>ſerv'd up in a Gooſe-Pye,</hi> That this Pocket
<hi>Abridgement</hi> of <hi>Womanhood</hi> might as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly pretend to
incorporate Herſelf with one of the <hi>Gyants,</hi> in the King of
<hi>Pruſſia</hi>'s <hi>frightful Regiment,</hi> as I, to <hi>match my
Mind</hi> with one, whoſe <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> is, ſo vaſtly, too
<hi>big</hi> for me!—</p>
                  <p> AT my firſt coming, I was receiv'd, by an <hi>old Maiden
Aunt,</hi> who is Miſtreſs of the Ceremonies to the Lady I was recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to; ſhe ſurpriz'd me with a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That ſhe <hi>knew of my coming,
before ſhe receiv'd my Father's Letter,</hi> I ſaid, I 
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0199100802:303"/> thought it had been a <hi>Secret:</hi> but ſhe
aſſur'd me. That I had been <hi>hanging, for a whole Week paſt, upon one
of the Bars of the Kitchen Chimney.</hi>—Not being intirely
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd,</hi> as to the <hi>Authority</hi> of this dark Prognoſtick,
I was preparing to ask a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or too; but was <hi>ſcar'd</hi> out of
the Intention, by a melancholy Denunciation, <hi>That my Father wou'd not live
to ſee the Match come to Perfection</hi>; for this Good Lady had (the Night
before this Letter was brought to her) <hi>ſeen it coming, in Both her
Candles, with a Winding-Sheet juſt over-againſt it!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> I BOW'D, with a becoming <hi>Sorrow</hi>; and receiv'd the
Prophecy with all that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> which was due to ſo
<hi>extraordinary a Reaſon!</hi> This won her to a Warmth in my Intereſt;
and ſhe would carry me, without Ceremony, to <hi>ſurprize</hi> her Neice,
in the Garden, where ſhe was viſiting her <hi>Orange Trees,</hi> in the
<hi>Green-Houſe:</hi>—We were got as forward, on this pleaſing
Journey, as to the outſide of the Garden Door, when ſome or other of
thoſe <hi>buſy Powers who envy Lovers their propos'd Enjoyments,</hi> put
it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Old Lady's <hi>Feet, to ſtumble over the Threſhold!</hi> upon
which ſhe turn'd back, in a Fright, and puſh'd me <hi>in</hi> again, with
ſuch <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> that I can never ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<hi>thank</hi> her; ſince, if I had <hi>gone on,</hi> (after ſuch an
<hi>ominous Warning</hi>) <hi>and met my Miſtreſs, in an unlucky
Minute,</hi> All the <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0199100802:304"/> World, it ſeems, from that Time
forward, could never have made it poſſible for me to <hi>come near her, in
a</hi> LUCKY <hi>one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> SHE overtook us, however, as ſoon as we were got back, into
the Parlor; and broke in upon me with ſuch a <hi>Flaſh</hi> of
<hi>Charms,</hi> that, as I ſaluted her, I was ſtruck dumb with
<hi>Rapture,</hi> out, of which I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Time to over-hear her tell the
Old Lady, as ſhe was paſſing round her, to a Chair, <hi>That it was not
I, that had drawn open her Curtains, when the Bride-Cake was put under her
Pillow.</hi>—I was not, yet, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to know what <hi>Good,</hi>
or <hi>Ill,</hi> this <hi>boded</hi> me: But, before we were fully ſeated, a
new Misfortune had befallen us.—My <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s <hi>Chair tumbled
backward,</hi> upon which ſhe declared to me, with the prettieſt
Reſignation in the World, <hi>That ſhe was not to be</hi> LADY-MAYORESS,
<hi>this Year</hi>; but had <hi>Patience</hi> to ſupport herſelf, under all
ſuch Diſappointments.</p>
                  <p> BEING now got into perfect Compoſure, I began to find, that I
was <hi>looking ſilly,</hi>—So I ſigh'd three Times, and inform'd
her, as well as I cou'd, of the <hi>Great Reſpect my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had, for the
Family;</hi> And <hi>Clarinda,</hi> on her Part, had open'd her Fan, to its
full Extent, and was looking down upon it, in the proper <hi>Attitude</hi>; and
telling the Sticks, with both Fingers, when the Aunt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted me with a
Groan, (that had been unluckily mention'd by my naming my <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0199100802:305"/> 
                     <hi>Father)</hi> and confirm'd her former Remark, of the <hi>Winding
Sheet,</hi> by a <hi>Death's Head, ſhe had found out, in the
Fire!</hi>—As <hi>Great Misfortunes</hi> rarely come <hi>ſingle,</hi> a
malicious Coal, <hi>in the Shape of a Coffin,</hi> flew, juſt then, to
<hi>Clarinda</hi>'s Feet; who turn'd pale, and took it up, betwixt a Finger,
and Thumb, and after throwing it <hi>behind</hi> her, over the <hi>left</hi>
Shoulder, corroborated her Aunt's Evidence, by a <hi>Death-Watch,</hi> that had
kept her <hi>waking</hi>;—By the <hi>howling of a Dog,</hi> all Night
long;—By a deep <hi>Grave</hi> that he had ſcratch'd up, at the Foot of
a <hi>Roſemary</hi> Buſh, exactly under her Window!</p>
                  <p> AND, now, their Eyes being turn'd on Me, as if they expected my
Opinion; I gave it them, very gravely, <hi>That theſe Things had ſomewhat
in 'm!</hi>—and it was happy for me, that I ſaid no <hi>leſs</hi> for
an Old Family Servant, with a ſober, mournful, Face, having heard Part of the
Diſcourſe, while he was buſy about the Fire, very diſmally confirm'd
our Terrors, by Three Proofs, which were ſtronger than all.—Firſt, by
the <hi>ſqueaking of a Weaſel,</hi> that had met him upon the
<hi>Cellar-Stairs</hi>; Secondly, by a <hi>Hole, that the Rats had gnaw'd, in
the Back of his beſt Livery:</hi> And, Thirdly, by a ſtrange
<hi>Dream,</hi> that Mrs. <hi>Suſan,</hi> the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maid, had been
almoſt frighted out of her <hi>Wits</hi> by, about <hi>Wet
Cloaths,—Three Miniſters,—Ripe Fruit,—and Roſes in
Bloſſom!</hi>—After all which, to put it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely 
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0199100802:306"/> out of Doubt, and <hi>convince</hi> us, <hi>That
ſomebody wou'd die ſhortly,</hi> he ſhew'd us on one of his Hands, a
dirty <hi>yellow Spot,</hi> which the Thumb, of his other (as he ſhook his
Head, and obſerv'd to us) was not <hi>broad</hi> enough to <hi>cover</hi>;
and this, they all agreed, was no better than a <hi>Death-Mould,</hi> and
<hi>muſt mean ſomething.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IN the midſt of theſe <hi>Miſeries,</hi> I had very
little to ſay for my ſelf, having been <hi>put out</hi> of a premeditated
<hi>Speech,</hi> which I had been inventing during my whole Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but as
<hi>Good-Luck</hi> wou'd have it, the <hi>Tea</hi> came in, to my Relief; and
the firſt <hi>Diſh,</hi> that had the Bleſſing to approach
<hi>Clarinda</hi>'s Lips, was ſo richly cover'd with <hi>Money-bags,</hi>
floating in white Circles, all over the Surface, that <hi>Gayety</hi> took
Place of <hi>Melancholy.</hi>—A little <hi>Spider</hi> too, was ſo kind
as to <hi>ſpin down Good-Luck, into her Lap,</hi> (which, methought, meant
<hi>me</hi> no Harm) Nay, I became, on a ſudden, ſo happy, that her
<hi>Elbow</hi> declar'd in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and her Aunt put her to the
<hi>Bluſh,</hi> by obſerving, <hi>ſhe muſt change her
Bedfellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> BUT let no Man be too much in <hi>Haſte,</hi> to conclude,
that He is <hi>happy.</hi>—My Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph was <hi>daſh'd at once,</hi> by
a Diſcovery That <hi>this was Childermas-Day:</hi> After which my
Miſtreſs ſaid no more, but that <hi>Nothing wou'd come to Good, that was
begun on that worſt Day of the Week:</hi> So her Teeth ach'd <hi>moſt
prodigiouſly?</hi> She was ſorry ſhe cou'd be <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0199100802:307"/>
                     <hi>no Company</hi>; and took her Leave of us, till next Morning.</p>
                  <p> NEXT Morning came;—and the firſt Perſon I met, was
Mrs. <hi>Suſan</hi>; whom I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, croſs the Hall, ſpitting
ſeriouſly in her Hand, and ſhutting it cloſe, with a great deal of
Caution, for Fear of <hi>letting ſlip</hi> (as ſhe afterwards told me) a
<hi>Sign,</hi> ſhe had felt, in her Palm, that a <hi>handſome Gift</hi> was
very near her.—I was glad of this favourable Opportunity, to confirm the
<hi>Truth of that Token</hi>; and ſhe was ſo oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<hi>Communicative</hi> as to intruſt me with two great Secrets, <hi>One,</hi>
That, <hi>I had trod upon her Lady's Toe,</hi> laſt Night, in the Hurry of
waiting on her to the Stair-foot; whence a Concluſion had been drawn, in my
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>That I ſhou'd come, e'er long, to her Bedſide.</hi>—The
<hi>other,</hi> that Mrs. <hi>Suſan</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcover'd, this very
Morning, That one of her Lady's <hi>Stockings</hi> had been <hi>put on,
wrongſide outward,</hi> was forbid pulling it off again, for Fear of
<hi>turning ſome Good-Luck, that was meant her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> Mrs. <hi>SUSAN,</hi> in Return for her kind Intelligence, was
very Earneſt to know, whether I had <hi>dreamt of no Body?</hi>—I told
her, I had had the Happineſs to be, all Night, in <hi>Her Lady's
Company:</hi> And I cou'd perceive, that this Information was no more than had
been expected; which led me into ſome probable Gueſſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the
Purpoſe of a <hi>Caſe-Knife, in a</hi> 
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0199100802:308"/>
                     <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> which, when I got up, in the Morning, I had found,
<hi>under my Bolſter.</hi>—While, I held this Conference with my
<hi>Fellow-Servant,</hi> we had the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of bidding our <hi>Miſtreſs
Goodmorrow,</hi> and of hearing (to my no ſmall Comfort) That her
<hi>Foot,</hi> as ſhe came down Stairs, had given her the Signal, <hi>That
ſhe was to tread upon ſtrange Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IN fine, Sir, it is impoſſible for you to conceive what an
infinite Variety of <hi>Notices, Impulſes,</hi> and <hi>Prognoſticks,</hi>
outward, and inward, theſe Ladies direct their Conduct by.—In my Three
Days ſtay, (which I thought enough for my firſt Viſit) I cou'd learn
nothing, with any certainty, of what I chiefly ſought to know; but was
edified, above Meaſure, in the <hi>Occult Sciences of the
Family.</hi>—My Miſtreſs call'd after me, when I had taken Horſe to
come away, that ſhe was afraid I ſhou'd have a <hi>wet Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>; for
<hi>Puſs was waſhing her Face,</hi> and carried her <hi>Paw above her
Ears;</hi> which, ſhe aſſur'd me, was a <hi>Sign,</hi> that had never
been known to miſcarry.—Whether ſhe meant this as a Diſplay of her
<hi>Art,</hi> or of her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to bring me back again,</hi> is a
Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which, notwithſtanding the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance I have made in
<hi>gueſſing,</hi> I am, yet, unable to diſcloſe, with any poſitive
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</p>
                  <p> BUT, I wou'd not, (for all that) have you think ſlightly of
my <hi>Skill in Tokens</hi>; <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0199100802:309"/> ſince I cou'd
<hi>aſtoniſh</hi> you, if I thought fit, with a Profuſion of
<hi>portentous Myſteries.</hi>—I am abſolutely Maſter of that
<hi>oraculous</hi> Secret, which is <hi>kneaded up,</hi> in the <hi>Dumb
Cake.</hi> I am inſtructed in the <hi>aweful Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> which are
ſacred to the fam'd <hi>Saint Agnes,</hi> to the Purity of whoſe
myſterious Worſhip <hi>Three Faſting Virgins</hi> muſt concur, with
ſo ſtrict an Abſtinence, That a KISS, during thoſe reſtrictive
<hi>Rites,</hi> wou'd be as <hi>Undoing,</hi> as a RAPE, after they are over. I
can foretell the moſt agreeable Things in the World, by <hi>Six Pea-ſhells
over a Door:</hi> And anticipate Conſequences, which wou'd puzzle a
<hi>Southſayer,</hi> by <hi>turning Three Times round, in my Shirt, and
falling into Bed, backward.</hi>—I know who will die, an Old Maid, by the
Help of a <hi>Grey Gooſe Wing,</hi> a <hi>Clean Hearth,</hi> and a <hi>Seive
full of Aſhes!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> BUT I ſhou'd never have done, were I I to let you into the
Virtues of <hi>Roſes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd on Midſummer Night</hi>—of
<hi>Hempſeed, ſown,</hi> and <hi>mow'n, in the Dark, upon the Graves of a
Country Church-Yard</hi>—of <hi>patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pretty Face with
Apple-Kernels</hi>—of <hi>Cutting the Nails, faſting</hi>—of
<hi>twiſting a Garter, in Nine Knots, round a Bed-Poſt</hi>—of <hi>a
Certain Hair, that you may find in your Shooe the firſt Time you hear the
Cuckoo</hi>—and a Thouſand other <hi>deep Diſcoveries,</hi> which I
have made, in this delightful Journey: And, which have put me quite out of
Conceit with my former Studies; ſince, after having <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0199100802:310"/>
                     <hi>labour'd</hi> to be <hi>wiſe,</hi> ſo many Years, in a
<hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> I found my ſelf, (notwithſtanding) little better than a

            <p>WE had once a Species of <hi>Opera,</hi> call'd <hi>Dramatic,</hi>
in which the Dignity of <hi>Reaſon</hi> was not ſacrific'd, as it is now,
to the Diſſoluteneſs of <hi>Sound</hi>; but the Force of <hi>Words</hi>
and <hi>Meaning,</hi> was increas'd by <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> and
<hi>Decoration,</hi> and impreſs'd upon the Soul, by the Mediation of the
<hi>Senſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0199100802:311"/>I HAVE heard, with a Pleaſure, which, I
hope, was not groundleſs, That there is a Deſign on foot, in one of our
<hi>Theatres,</hi> to reſtore theſe manly, as well as delightful,
Entertainments, with an Elegance, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of Ornament, which we have
not yet been accuſtom'd to.—The Succeſs, which <hi>Diocleſian</hi>
has met with (an <hi>Opera,</hi> of <hi>this Kind,</hi> but far ſhort of the
Perfection, which I am told it is propos'd to raiſe to them to) will ſerve,
it is to be hop'd, as an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to keep the Gentleman, who is
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentee</hi> of that <hi>Theatre, firm</hi> and <hi>vigorous,</hi> in his
Intention.—His Genius is admirably turn'd to thoſe Embelliſhments of
<hi>Show</hi> and <hi>Scenary,</hi> which will always have a ſurprizing, and
powerful Effect, on the <hi>Stage</hi>; but <hi>moſt</hi> where they are
aptly, and ſignificantly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced:—And, there are not wanting
<hi>Writers,</hi> who can contribute <hi>Subject,</hi> and
<hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,</hi> whereon to exhauſt, in the moſt rational, as well as
agreeable Manner, the ſprightly Copiouſneſs of his Invention. So that I
am almoſt led to flatter my ſelf, That our emaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating preſent
Taſte, of the <hi>Italian</hi> Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and <hi>Wantonneſs</hi> of
<hi>Muſick,</hi> will give way to a more <hi>Paſſionate,</hi> and
animated Kind of <hi>Opera,</hi> where not only the <hi>Eye</hi> and
<hi>Ear</hi> may expect to be <hi>charm'd,</hi> but the <hi>Heart</hi> to be
touch'd and tranſported.</p>
            <p>IT will be receiv'd as the Effect of <hi>Spleen,</hi> or
<hi>Affectation,</hi> to inſinuate, That the Martial Spirit of our Nation, is
effeminated, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0199100802:312"/> relax'd, by the Influence of
this ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening <hi>Syren:</hi> And yet <hi>Cicero</hi> (who was at leaſt
as good a Judge as moſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our <hi>ROYAL ACADEMY for
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of TRIFLING)</hi> has not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to ſay plainly, (in his
Tract <hi>de Legibus)</hi>—That <hi>the Good or Evil, in a State, depends
greatly on the MUSICK, that is moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd in it: For, if it be too
Light, and Wanton, the People are inſenſibly render'd fooliſh, and
diſorderly; and, on the contrary, if it be Grave and Maſculine, they become
modeſt, by its Influence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Spartan</hi> Plainneſs and Auſterity, have been
celebrated in every Age: And Hiſtories are full of Inſtances of that Wiſe
People's Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, againſt <hi>Innovation,</hi> in Particulars which ſeem'd
to threaten them (at what Diſtance ſoever) with the modiſh Luxuries of
their Neighbours: But the ſtrongeſt Impreſſion which was ever made upon
me in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, was from the Decree they paſſed againſt
<hi>Timotheus,</hi> the <hi>Mileſian,</hi> for an <hi>Improvement</hi> he had
introduced in <hi>Muſick,</hi> much like the admir'd <hi>Concerto's</hi> of
our <hi>Italian Benefactors.</hi> But theſe Grave <hi>Men of
Foreſight,</hi> diſcern'd the Conſequences of ſuch pretended
Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and provided againſt it, by this time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Edict,</hi> with
<hi>Lylius Gyraldus</hi> has inſerted, as he tranſcrib'd it, from
<hi>Boetius.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>FORASMUCH as <hi>Timotheus,</hi> the <hi>Mileſian,</hi>
(receiv'd into our City) holding <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0199100802:313"/> in Contempt the ancient
<hi>Muſick,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the <hi>Harp with Seven Strings,</hi> hath
introduced an <hi>Harmony of many Voices,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Ears of our
Youth, by a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Strings, and a Muſick hitherto unknown,
<hi>Dividing the Simple Notes,</hi> into a Variety of <hi>Feints</hi> and
<hi>Quaverings,</hi> We do therefore Ordain, That he ſhall be
<hi>impeach'd,</hi> and that his ſuperfluous Strings <hi>ſhall be
broken:</hi> To the End, that <hi>Strangers,</hi> from <hi>his Example,</hi>
may be wary of bringing among <hi>Spartans,</hi> the light, and unmanly,
Amuſements, which are practis'd, in <hi>leſs modeſt Countries.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>WHEN I reflect on the Power of Muſick, as it was practis'd among
the Ancients, and conſider the miraculous Inſtances of its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, on the
Paſſions of ſome Princes, who were moſt inflexible in their
Reſolutions: And, when, at the ſame Time, I conſider, That the Muſick,
which had this prodigious Influence, was the Reverſe (as I ſhall
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently prove) of That, which now prevails in <hi>Europe,</hi> and which
produces none of thoſe <hi>tranſporting Effects,</hi> What leſs can I
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, than that All our boaſted Additions to this heavenly Art, are
rather <hi>Enlargements</hi> than <hi>Improvements:</hi>—There is a
little Piece, of <hi>Randolph</hi>'s; which, of all his Poems, I am moſt
pleas'd with; and which gives us, as it were in <hi>Miniature,</hi> the whole,
that can be ſaid, of Muſick!</p>

               <l>Muſick! Thou Queen of Souls;—Ariſe, and ſtring</l>

               <l>And <hi>liſt'ning Tempeſts</hi> catch the mournful Tone!</l>

               <l>Then, on a ſudden, with excurſive Hand,</l>

            </q>
            <p>I SAID, above, That the ſtrange Effects, reported of
<hi>Muſick in former Times,</hi> were the Influence of a Practice, very
different from the <hi>modern</hi>; and I cannot more effectually ſtrengthen
that Aſſertion, than by obſerving I am confirm'd in it, by the Opinion of
Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> communicated, on this Subject, to the <hi>Royal
Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Muſick of the Antients was more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive</hi> than
ours: For <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Dancing</hi> (or meaſur'd Motion) were then
accounted Parts of <hi>Muſick.</hi>—Now, we know, that
<hi>Verſe,</hi> if harmonious, and paſſionate, <hi>ſet</hi> to a
<hi>plain Tune,</hi> and ſung by a <hi>natural Voice,</hi> with ſome
<hi>ſoft Inſtrumental Muſick,</hi> ſuch as not drowns, or obſcures,
but heightens the <hi>Emphatick</hi> Expreſſions; will work ſtrangely
upon the Ear, and move all our Paſſions, in Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the
<hi>Tune</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi>; but eſpecially, if attended with
ſuitable <hi>Geſture</hi> and <hi>Action.</hi> For, 'tis evident, on the
<hi>Stage,</hi> that proper <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0199100802:315"/> 
               <hi>Acting</hi> gives great
<hi>Life</hi> to Words. Now, all this <hi>together,</hi> (which made up the
Ancient <hi>Muſick)</hi> muſt needs operate ſtrongly on the Fancy and
Affections.—For, if the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Reading of a Romance (if it happens
to be well penn'd) will produce <hi>Mirth, Tears, Pity, Anger,
Indignation,</hi> according to the reſpective Intents of it, much more wou'd
it do ſo, if accompined with all thoſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſſiſtants.</p>
            <p>WHY may not all This be <hi>now</hi> done, as well as
<hi>then?</hi>—No Doubt it <hi>may,</hi> and with equal <hi>Effect</hi>
too, if the <hi>Words</hi> were but elegantly adapted to the <hi>Argument,</hi>
and diſpos'd in Places, proper for their <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> pronounc'd with
a tuneful <hi>Voice,</hi> and inlivened by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive <hi>Geſture,</hi>
painting naturally the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Condition, of the Mind; and
<hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically delineating,</hi> as it were, to the <hi>Eye</hi> (as well as
addreſſing to the <hi>Ear</hi>) the Bounds, Diſtinctions, and peculiar
Attributes, of <hi>Joy, Grief, Wonder, Fury, Jealouſy, Compaſſion, Fear,
Love, Hatred,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Emotions, which the acted Mind is
ſubject to.—This wou'd, as certainly <hi>now,</hi> as <hi>then,</hi>
produce extraordinary Effects; and eſpecially upon a <hi>Surprize,</hi> where
Perſons are not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd, or pre-engag'd; and, ſo lie open to the meant
Impreſſions.</p>
            <p>OUR modern <hi>Muſick</hi> is no more than what the Ancients
call'd <hi>Harmonick,</hi> which was but one Part of <hi>Theirs,</hi> whoſe
<hi>Muſick,</hi> as I ſaid above, conſiſted of <hi>Words, Verſe,
Voice,</hi> 
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0199100802:316"/> 
               <hi>Tune, Inſtrument,</hi> and
<hi>Action.</hi>—A very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Combination!—And can we expect,
from <hi>One Piece,</hi> the ſame Influence, as from the
<hi>Whole?</hi>—The Deſign of <hi>Muſick,</hi> among <hi>Us,</hi>
ſeems to aim at exciting no <hi>particular Paſſion</hi>; but, in general,
to <hi>pleaſe the Ear</hi>; and, by a tuneful Intermixture of <hi>different
Voices</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> with <hi>Cadencies</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,</hi>
produce an <hi>elegant Sound,</hi> which only thoſe Perſons can diſcern,
who have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <hi>Judgment</hi> in <hi>Muſick</hi>; while That
much larger Part of the Audience, which conſiſts of Thoſe who have a
<hi>rude,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated <hi>Ear,</hi> remains only amus'd, and
confounded, with a <hi>great Noiſe,</hi> which has Nothing
diſtinguiſhable to their Capacity.</p>
            <p>'TIS true, indeed, that even this <hi>Compound Muſick</hi>
admits of <hi>Characters,</hi> very different: Some are <hi>brisk, elate</hi>
and <hi>airy</hi>; ſome <hi>ſedate</hi> and <hi>grave</hi>; others
<hi>ſoft, reſign'd</hi> and <hi>languid:</hi>—But, ſtill, That kind
of Harmony which is moſt powerful to excite particular Paſſions, or
Diſpoſitions, in the Mind, is the <hi>ſimple, natural,</hi> and
<hi>uncompounded.</hi>—How often have I been forced to go abroad when I
had no mind to it, or <hi>fall aſleep,</hi> in the middle of the Day, by a
<hi>Nurſe's languid Tune,</hi> lulling her Babe to reſt, in a Room, within
my hearing!—Nay, continual Reading in an <hi>even Tone,</hi>—the
ſoft Murmur of a pebbly Brook,—the falling of Rain upon
Trees,—ſhall have an irreſiſtable Power to induce a Repoſe upon
the Spirits.—And, on the contrary, an <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0199100802:317"/>
               <hi>derman</hi> who is lame of the <hi>Gout,</hi> ſhall feel himſelf grow
light, and wanton, at the brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a <hi>Jig,</hi> on a <hi>Kit,</hi> or
<hi>Violin,</hi> exciting a Diſpoſition to <hi>dance,</hi> that is almoſt
too hard for his <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Gravity.</hi>—Nothing is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
therefore, than that <hi>ſimple Harmony</hi> is more operative on the
<hi>Affections,</hi> than an ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate <hi>Compoſition</hi> of <hi>Full
Muſick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SO that, if it is the Aim of <hi>Muſick</hi> to <hi>pleaſe the
Ear,</hi> the Compoſitions of <hi>Italian</hi> Maſters may deſerve to be
<hi>preferr'd,</hi> as form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſweeter Conſorts</hi> than were known
to the Ancients; among whom I find no Footſteps of what we call <hi>ſeveral
Parts</hi> or <hi>Voices</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Baſe, Treble, Mean,</hi> &amp;c.
ſung in Conſort) <hi>anſwering</hi> each other, to diverſify, and fill
up, the Muſick.—But, if we mean, by <hi>Muſick,</hi> to excite
Paſſion, and, move the Heart, to any moral, or ſolid Purpoſe, we muſt
apply a more touching <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and endeavour to act <hi>upon
Nature,</hi> in a more <hi>natural,</hi> and unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Manner. And This, I
doubt not, a judicious <hi>Compoſer</hi> may ſo happily effect, that
(allowing for thoſe <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> with which the Antient Writers ſet
off their Muſick) our Modern may be found capable of producing as
extraordinary Effects as theirs.—And, <hi>This,</hi> methinks, is a
<hi>Mine</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>open'd,</hi> and may deſerve to be
thought on, with ſome Attention, by Thoſe, whoſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> wou'd
be the certain Conſequence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a <hi>Novelty,</hi> ſo
powerfully attractive. But I ſhall ſay more, concerning theſe Things,
upon ſome future Occaſion.</p>

                  <p> THERE is a diſhonourable Kind of Practice, among the Men, who
ſtyle themſelves the <hi>Wits,</hi> which I can no longer forbear
complaining againſt, as an Abuſe that deſerves the Notice, and
Correction, of a PLAIN DEALER.—You muſt needs have obſerv'd, that our
<hi>Poets</hi> are, like our <hi>Politicians,</hi> divided into oppoſite
<hi>Parties</hi>; and draw their Pens, with great Sharpneſs, to the Defiance
of each other's <hi>Muſes.</hi>—Among theſe Warriors, (on both Sides)
there are a turbulent Sett of People, not <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but
<hi>Engineers,</hi> who are known by the Name of <hi>Cannon-Turners:</hi> They
never <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0199100802:319"/> trouble themſelves to provide <hi>Wit, of their
own,</hi> but are ſure, by ſome Stratagem, to ſteal <hi>That, of their
Enemies;</hi> and apply it to a Purpoſe, the Reverſe of what it was
intended for.—The only Difficulty, they are at, is to ſubſtitute the
Word TORY, in the Place of the Monoſyllable, WHIG, without Detriment to the
<hi>Meaſure</hi> of the <hi>Verſe</hi>; or to crowd the unpliable
Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of PRESBYTERIAN, into the paſſive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of JACOBITE:
For, when theſe little Difficulties are once happily adjuſted, they have
turn'd the Malice of their Adverſary's Meaning directly <hi>againſt
Themſelves;</hi> and by killing, with this <hi>good Husbandry,</hi> ſave
the Expence of Artillery.</p>
                  <p> BUT it were well, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, if theſe
<hi>Cannon-Turners</hi> wou'd confine the Exerciſe of their invertive Talents

are never ſo active, as when we are at <hi>War</hi> with any of our

                  <p> I SHALL better clear to your Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, what Juſtice

That <hi>there is nothing, ſo ſoft, ſo tender, and pathetick; and, at the

                  <p> A CERTAIN Friend of Ours, whom we love very well, has drunk

it infus'd; but here I <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0199100802:328"/> think my ſelf oblig'd to
declare, that I mean, by <hi>exceſſive Drinking,</hi> a conſtant, daily,
or frequent Drinking, to a greater Quantity than is ſufficient to cheriſh
Nature.</p>
                  <p> ALL the reſt of the Vices together, are not ſo often
puniſh'd by ſudden Death as exceſſive Drinking alone is, which
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens by the Malignity of the Vice it ſelf, oppreſſing and
ſtifling Nature, and ſometimes by the fatal Accidents which attend upon it
as falſe Quarrels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> OUR Friend whom I mention'd above, has no leſs than
<hi>Twice,</hi> to my Knowledge, very narrowly eſcap'd <hi>ſudden
Death,</hi> which had like to have happen'd <hi>both Times,</hi> by
Exceſſive Drinking, once formerly in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns-Inn-Fields,</hi> and
another Time lately at <hi>S—</hi> Now, as a Death that gives no Time for
Repentance, ought to be look'd upon as the greateſt of all Puniſhments,
Exceſſive Drinking, ought to be regarded as the greateſt of all Vices,
becauſe we ought to believe, That Divine Juſtice has propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<hi>Puniſhments</hi> to the <hi>Crimes</hi> for which they are inflicted; and
becauſe there is no Vice, by which he who uſes it, ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
Defaces or ſo totally Deſtroys, in himſelf, the <hi>Image of God,</hi>
which is <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> I hope that upon reading this, you will have the
Goodneſs to admoniſh our Friend, who has ſo narrowly eſcap'd
<hi>twice,</hi> to beware of a <hi>third Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0199100802:329"/> AS the State of the Mind depends upon
that of the Body, and the Motions of that Particle of Heavenly Fire, upon the
Motions of the animal Spirits, which in time of <hi>Health,</hi> move
Vigorouſly, and Regularly; and Weakly, and Irregularly, in time of
<hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; it muſt neceſſarily be, that <hi>That</hi> Vice
which is the Occaſion of moſt Diſeaſes in the Body, muſt be
likewiſe the Cauſe of moſt Diſorders in the Mind. And there is no Vice
that is ſo great an Enemy to the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> as exceſſive
Drinking, or that ſo often entirely <hi>Overturns</hi> it. Indeed, Drinking
to Exceſs while the Fit continues, ſometimes ſtrengthens the
<hi>Imagination</hi>; but, by the ſame Degrees by which it <hi>raiſes</hi>
the Imagination, it <hi>Depreſſes</hi> the Judgment, the former of which is
common to us with <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and the latter with <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Angels.</hi> But then the Day <hi>after</hi> Drinking, the very Imagination
languiſhes with the Judgment. And Drinking to Exceſs never fails, <hi>in
time,</hi> to <hi>Quench</hi> the Imagination, to <hi>impair</hi> the Memory,
and to drown the Judgment.</p>
                  <p> I DESIRE that you would admoniſh one of our Friend's
<hi>Capacity</hi> to take Notice, That <hi>Bacchus</hi> is often a great
<hi>Leveller,</hi> that he levels the Underſtandings of <hi>Wiſe</hi> Men
and <hi>Fools,</hi> of the Blockhead, and the Man of Senſe; and that
therefore, as 'tis the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Fools to carry on this Vice, 'tis the
Intereſt of Men of Senſe to avoid it.</p>
                  <p> I DESIRE that you would likewiſe put Him in mind that the
ſame <hi>Drunken Deity</hi> 
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0199100802:330"/> is often <hi>worſe</hi>
than <hi>a Leveller</hi>; that he is often a <hi>Subverter</hi> of the Order of
Things, and pulls down the <hi>Rich,</hi> and exalts the <hi>Poor</hi>; that
is, he gives Underſtanding to <hi>Fools,</hi> and makes Men of Senſe
<hi>Madmen.</hi> For Fools having generally ſtronger Nerves and leſs
volatile Spirits, than Men of great Underſtandings, or of Beautiful
Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ſame Quantity of Spiritous Liquor that will ſet Fire to
the Phlegm of Fools and by that Means <hi>rouſe their Capacities,</hi> will
make Men of Senſe either <hi>ſtupid</hi> or <hi>frantick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> AS there is no Vice, which more impairs the Underſtanding and
weakens the Reaſon, there is none which more inflames the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and
diſorders the <hi>Will.</hi> Several other Vices are <hi>Solitary,</hi> and
each of them ſhuns the Company of the reſt; but exceſſive Drinking is
attended with the very worſt of them, that is, with thoſe which have the
directeſt Tendency to the Miſery and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Men; as <hi>Gaming,
Quarrels, Riots, Murders,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p> MOST <hi>other Vices</hi> are <hi>compatible</hi> with
ſeveral <hi>Virtues,</hi> but Drunkenneſs runs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to all the Duties
of Life: A great Drinker, is, for the moſt part, neither a good
<hi>Husband,</hi> nor a good <hi>Father,</hi> nor a good <hi>Son,</hi> nor a
good <hi>Brother,</hi> nor a good <hi>Friend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> BUT 'tis not <hi>Virtue</hi> only that <hi>Deteſts
Drunkenneſs;</hi> 'tis often abhorr'd even by <hi>Vice</hi> it ſelf, as by
<hi>Avarice, Hypocriſie, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> 
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0199100802:331"/>
                     <hi>Bigottry</hi> and <hi>Luſt.</hi> As this unnatural Sin of Drinking is
attended with ſeveral that bring Miſery and Deſtruction on thoſe who
uſe them, as has been ſaid above; 'tis often ſhunn'd by that Human,
<hi>Natural Vice,</hi> which tends to the Propagation of Mankind, as much as it
is by <hi>Vertue.</hi> For there is nothing ſo Inconſiſtent or
Incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with exceſſive Drinking, as the Cleanneſs, Elegance, and
Delicacy, of a <hi>Courtly Gallantry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> AS the Right Management of Human Affairs, requires Health of
Body, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and Serenity of Mind, we ought not to wonder, if a Vice that
breaks the Reſt in him, impairs the Underſtanding, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Memory,
inflames the Paſſions, and debauches the Will, entirely unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Man
for doing what the World calls <hi>Buſineſs.</hi> And therefore hard
Drinking has ruin'd more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, than all the reſt of
our Vices, put together; not by the immediate Expence which attends upon the
Vice, but by altering the very <hi>Natures</hi> of the Heads of Families who
uſe it, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them unfit for the Management of their Affairs, of which
they were very capable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: For other Vices, indeed make Men
<hi>worſe,</hi> but a Habitude of exceſſive Drinking often alters Men, to
that Degree, That they become the <hi>very Reverſe</hi> of what they were
before, and differ more from their <hi>former Selves,</hi> than from their
<hi>preſent Companions.</hi> Such a Habit, when it has been long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0199100802:332"/> has often made the <hi>Ambitious</hi> indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the
<hi>Prudent</hi> inconſiderate, the <hi>Active</hi> idle, and the
<hi>Induſtrious</hi> ſlothful and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: So that their Affairs are
ruin'd for Want of <hi>Application,</hi> or, by being intruſted in the Hands
of thoſe, who turn them wholly to their own Advantage, and to the Ruin of
thoſe who employ them.</p>
                  <p> AS <hi>Perſonal</hi> Vices are the Cauſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Calamities, ſo <hi>National</hi> Vices are the Grounds of National
Sufferings. And as no Vice does more Harm to particular Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than
frequent Drinking to Exceſs, or lays the Foundation of more Diſeaſes, and
of more ill Humours, in them; there is none of our publick Vices, which does
more Harm to our National Conſtitution, or occaſions more Corruption in it
than this pernicious Habitude. And as this Cuſtom in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons
cauſes them to neglect their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Affairs, and either to leave them
wholly undone, or to leave them to be done by thoſe, who will make their
proper Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of them, tho' to the Ruin of thoſe who entruſted them, as
has been ſaid above; the ſame Thing is not unlike to happen to this
Drinking Nation.</p>
                  <p> TO be ſatisfy'd of this, if we may judge of the Future by the
Paſt, we need only caſt an Eye back upon our <hi>Elections,</hi> in which
Thouſands of <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> (as far as in them lay) have ſold their
own <hi>Liberties,</hi> and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi> for
<hi>Liquors. Eſau</hi> 
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0199100802:333"/> ſold his <hi>Birth-Right</hi>
for a <hi>Meſs</hi> of <hi>Pottage</hi>; but then He ſold only his
<hi>own</hi> Birth-Right, and he ſold it to his <hi>Brother</hi>; and he
ſold it to <hi>ſupport Nature,</hi> in the <hi>Extremity</hi> of
<hi>Hunger.</hi> But Thouſands of our <hi>Electors,</hi> have ſold, (as far
as in them lay) not only their <hi>own</hi> Birth-Rights, their <hi>own</hi>
Liberties, but the Liberties and Birth-Rights of <hi>their Brethren,</hi> for
nauſeous Loads to <hi>oppreſs,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy Nature.</hi> I know,
indeed, very well, that upon thoſe Occaſions, in order to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt People,
there is a little of the <hi>Solid</hi> made Uſe of ſometimes, as well as a
great deal of the <hi>Liquid.</hi> But I have a better Opinion of ſome of my
Countrymen, than to believe, That they would <hi>ſell</hi> their
<hi>Wives,</hi> their <hi>Children,</hi> and all their <hi>Poſterity,</hi>
for a <hi>Song,</hi> if, at the Time when They <hi>did</hi> it, They were
<hi>cool</hi> enough to conſider, <hi>What it is they are about.</hi>

                  <p> THUS, my dear Friend, have I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſhew the

                  <p> I AM a young <hi>Woman,</hi> juſt turn'd of
<hi>Fourteen</hi>; and my Father is a Doctor of <hi>Phyſick.</hi> But he
loves <hi>Poetry</hi> mightily: And we have a great many <hi>Wits</hi> come
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to dine with us. For my Part, I have no great Skill, yet, what
Difference there may be between one ſort of Men and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But I liſten,
when any of theſe <hi>Wits</hi> are talking with my Father, becauſe he
ſays, They can teach me Things, That I ſhall be the wiſer for, as long as
I live.</p>
                  <p> ONE of the prettieſt of them all, was reading to us,
yeſterday, ſome ingenious Copies of Verſes, out of a Book of Poems, that
is juſt come out; and I think he told us, it was writ by a Gentleman whoſe
Name is <hi>Baker.</hi>—They were particularly delighted with one little
Poem, among the Reſt, at which They all <hi>laugh'd,</hi> as if they were
<hi>mad:</hi> And ſaid, it was one of the <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0199100802:341"/>
                     <hi>Cleaneſt Turns</hi> They had met with: And my Father cou'd not reſt,
till he had taken a Copy of it.</p>
                  <p> I OBSERV'D, that my Mother, and my Eldeſt Siſter,
<hi>bluſh'd,</hi> while they were laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at it: But I (tho' I ſtole it
out of my Father's Pocket, the ſame Night, and have read it, over and over,
till I have got it by Heart) can make nothing of it, and am vex'd, becauſe I
<hi>want Underſtanding</hi> to find out the Meaning of ſomething that my

                  <p> I AM aſham'd to ask <hi>Queſtions</hi> about it at home,
for Fear of being found out to be Sillier than I ſhou'd be at my
Years.—And, therefore, I bethought my ſelf to beg the Favour of
<hi>you,</hi> to ſhew where the <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of That <hi>Turn</hi>
lies, that my Father, and his <hi>Wits,</hi> were ſo highly diverted

            <p>THE Force of <hi>Avarice</hi> is never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and
ſo much to be wonder'd at, as when it taints the Minds of Perſons eminent
in Quality and Circumſtance, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as one would think, againſt all
mean Temptations, by the large Revenues of a <hi>State Employment.</hi> It is
no ſuch great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Surprize, when we ſee this Tincture of
Covetouſneſs prevailing in a <hi>Mechanick,</hi> one whoſe Birth and
Education are upon a Level; one, who has undergone a State of Servitude, who
has learn'd to be ſcraping and penurious by Habit and Example; and who, by a
Converſation with Dirt and ſervile Gain, makes the amaſſing a Fortune
to be the chief End of Life. But we expect from a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Birth, and a
Liberal Education, Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuitable to their Dignity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0199100802:344"/>WE ſee, 'tis true, this <hi>dirty</hi>
Paſſion often <hi>blotting</hi> the <hi>Eſcutcheons</hi> of the Nobleſt
Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: And we find at the ſame time our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> for their
<hi>Quality</hi> turn'd into a <hi>Contempt</hi> for their Perſons. But how
much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable does this Vice appear, when we find it lodg'd in the
Breaſt of Him, whoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Merit, and the Favour of his Prince, have
raiſed him to preſide in <hi>Juſtice?</hi> We at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach Idea's of
Veneration to their Characters, who are <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>Law.</hi> We
look upon them as the Storehouſes of Wiſdom, and the Fountains of
Integrity: And were they, as it is ſaid of the old <hi>Perſian</hi>
Emperors, to appear in Publick but once in Seven Years, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, no doubt,
would carry up their Reſpect to the Pitch of <hi>Adoration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT our Deference for theſe Great Men is taken off, when we
ſee Frailties breaking thro' their Grandeur: When they proſtitute the
Sanctity of Honour and Conſcience, to Wealth, and unworthy Extorſion. My
Lord <hi>COKE,</hi> I remember, ſomewhere ſpeaking of <hi>Extortion</hi> in
a <hi>Judge,</hi> ſays, It is there worſe than Robbery: For <hi>Robbery is
apparent, and hath the Face of a Crime; but Extortion puts on the Viſor of
Vertue, for Expedition of Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is a very fine Aphoriſm, and worthy the Conſideration of
all Ages and Countries, That <hi>a Judge ought to be ſeaſon'd with two
Sorts of Salt; the Salt of</hi> Wiſdom, <hi>leſt he ſhould appear a</hi>
Fool, <hi>and the Salt of</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0199100802:345"/> 
               <hi>leſt
he ſhould appear a</hi> Devil. I cannot help recollecting, upon this
Occaſion, a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>AELIAN,</hi> who ſpeaking of the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> tells us, 
<q rend="inline">'That they boaſted to have receiv'd their
Syſtem of Laws from <hi>Mercury:</hi> And that their Judges, whenever they
ſate upon the Deciſion of Cauſes, wore, hanging upon their Breaſts, by
a Chain of Gold, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire Image, which was call'd <hi>Truth:</hi> But,
<hi>ſays the Author,</hi> I ſhould think it better, that, inſtead of the
<hi>material</hi> Image dangling at their <hi>Boſoms,</hi> they had the
<hi>Eſſence</hi> of it ſtampt on their <hi>Souls.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I WAS led into this Trace of thinking, by Peruſal of thoſe
Pamphlets which have lately been publiſh'd, concerning the famous Lord
<hi>BACON</hi>; and of another I met with in the Window of a <hi>Member</hi> of
<hi>Parliament,</hi> which is call'd, <hi>The</hi> CASE <hi>of</hi> ORPHANS,
<hi>conſider'd from Antiquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Title Page tells us, That a Part of of its Subject is, <hi>On
the Court of Chancery, having the Diſpoſition of Orphans Money.</hi> As I
obſerv'd ſome Paſſages in it, concerning the unreaſonable Truſt
which has been put in the <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> I ſhall
take the Liberty of tranſcribing a few, and making them a Part of this Day's
Entertainment.</p>
            <q> 
               <p> I MUST freely confeſs, <hi>(ſays this Author)</hi> it is
always my Opinion, That a Lord CHANCELLOR was a moſt proper
<hi>Truſtee,</hi> and <hi>Guardian,</hi> of the Intereſts of
<hi>Orphans,</hi> and <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0199100802:346"/> 
                  <hi>Widows.</hi> I have not
altogether retracted this Opinion, but I am ſo diffident of my own weak
Judgment, that ſtrong Clamour, and ſtrong Arguments, perſwade me often
not to be too poſitive or tenacious of my Sentiments. I am not ſo
perfectly, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, reconcil'd to a CHANCELLOR, and his <hi>Maſters,</hi>
having too intimate an Underſtanding with Each Other: And I begin to
ſuſpect it a Degree of <hi>Harmony,</hi> in no wiſe eſſential to the
Promotion of <hi>Equity.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> IT has been, as I am told, but by a very modern <hi>Order,</hi>
that the <hi>Suiters</hi> Monies have been lodg'd in the Hands of the
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>; and it may be to be wiſh'd that too many have not
Cauſe to be ſorry an Order of that Kind ever took Place.</p> 
               <p> THO' there be a loud Cry of <hi>Deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in the
<hi>Suiters</hi> Money ſo lodg'd, I am not taking upon me to impeach the
Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of thoſe Gentlemen, but only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That that
<hi>Order</hi> ſeems to have been as abſurd and unreaſonable, as it has
prov'd unhappy in its <hi>Conſequences.</hi> The Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of large
Sums of Money, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary Power of approving what Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
they ſhall be plac'd out on, is a Truſt of ſuch a Kind as might debauch
the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Minds, not the moſt ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd in Honeſty,
againſt the Aſſaults of Avarice and Advantage. It gives a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which
I hope was never taken, of <pb n="346" facs="tcp:0199100802:347"/> making Intereſt of that
Money in which they have no Property, and for which they are, barely
Truſtees; and at the ſame Time of not paying One Shilling of its Produce to
the right Owners, under Colour that they have not had any proper Security
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, upon which they could certify it ſafe and fitting to place it
out.</p> 
               <p> WERE there not the unhappy <hi>Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,</hi> which are at
this Time talk'd of, I think ſeveral Caſes of Conſcience might ariſe
upon the Poſſiblity of the <hi>Maſters</hi> Conduct, with Regard to this
Truſt. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe only, for Example, during the late unaccountable
Fluctuation of <hi>Stocks,</hi> when the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Frenzy was at the
Height, and <hi>Money</hi> yielded the Intereſt of a <hi>whole Year</hi> for
the Loan of a <hi>few Hours,</hi> any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Fortunes had been made by the
clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Application of thoſe very Monies, for which no Securities
could be found; or thoſe very Monies had been loſt in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
Venture for private Profit: What Reparation ſhould have been made to the
<hi>Suiters,</hi> or <hi>Orphans,</hi> whoſe Eſtates, in either Caſe,
were ſo <hi>happily,</hi> or <hi>unhappily,</hi> employ'd? Would they have
reap'd the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the firſt <hi>Stock-jobbing</hi>; or was there the
leaſt Reaſon that they ſhould ſit down with the Loſs of the
<hi>Latter?</hi> I make this but a Caſe of Suppoſition; and as it is
ſcarce probable that the ſame Frenzy ſhould ever again poſſeſs us,
yet ſhould it, the <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0199100802:348"/> Wiſdom of our PARLIAMENT is
providing, That the Monies of <hi>Orphans</hi> and other <hi>Suiters,</hi>
engag'd in <hi>Chancery,</hi> ſhall not be ſubject to ſuch Hazards.</p>
            </q>
            <p>BUT ſo much for Quotation. As I have above-mention'd the Name of
the Lord <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor BACON,</hi> who was accus'd by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
<hi>Bribery</hi> and <hi>Extortion,</hi> I ſhall add a a few Words here with
Regard to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct under that Accuſation. It has been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd very
ſingular in his Caſe, and He has been look'd upon as a Man of many
<hi>Fears,</hi> that he ſhould deſert his <hi>Defence,</hi> and, by a
<hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of his Guilt, throw
himſelf on the Favour of the Parliament. But my Lord <hi>BACON,</hi> who, as
it has been obſerv'd, knew that all Wounds ake with laying open, and that
Circumſtances are ſufficient to blaſt a Reputation, was reſolv'd to
avoid the Hazard of a publick Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It may very often be wiſer to
carry Defects private, than to ſtand too perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily on a Juſtification;
wherefore I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saying to be of great Weight, <hi>That no Man has
ſo many Faults, as he that takes upon him to have none at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS puts me in Mind of a FABLE, that I read in my younger Years,
and which I ſhall relate here, becauſe I am reſolv'd not to end with too
much Gravity.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0199100802:349"/> THERE was a Knot of good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions that
enter'd into a Club, under certain Rules and Orders for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the
Society. One Article among the reſt, was, 
<q rend="inline">"That whoever ſhould enroll himſelf a Member
of that <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> with any corporal <hi>Maim,</hi> or
<hi>Blemiſh</hi> about him, ſhould forfeit a Crown to the Board; and for
ſo many Defects, ſo many Crowns."</q> It fell out, that <hi>one</hi> Man in
the Company was obſerv'd to go <hi>Limp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and they call'd upon him
for his <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</hi> The Man put himſelf upon the Teſt, and was
found, in the Search, to have not only one Leg longer than the other, but a
<hi>Scurff</hi> all over his Body. Upon this Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very they demanded another
Crown, and then another, for a Glaſs-Eye he had. They preſs'd him in the
End ſo hard for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that it came to <hi>Stripping,</hi> and upon that
Struggle, they found he had a Rupture: <hi>So that the further he puſh'd his
Defence, his Conteſt become more Chargeable.</hi>

                  <p> YOU were pleas'd, in a late Paper, to thank Heaven, that
<hi>All</hi> our Lords are not <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Trade:</hi> For my Part, I

<hi>All Lords!</hi> They fall, ſo naturally, into <hi>Airs</hi> of

                  <p> YOU muſt know, Sir, that I am <hi>Agent,</hi> for one of our
<hi>American Colonies,</hi> and owe <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0199100802:351"/> to the Duties of
that Station the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being perfectly well acquainted with the

add (above all) to the <hi>Good Government</hi> of their <hi>Dear Brethren</hi>
in the Weſtern World!—I have receiv'd a thouſand Proofs of the

act, in Matters, which carry any Severity, in their Appearance: And, on the
other Hand, of the kind Vigour, and Reſoluti- with which They forward every
Motion, that but tends to the Encouragement, or Satisfaction, of their
Countrymen in thoſe remote, but important, Settlements.—I am not able,
therefore, to <hi>expreſs</hi> the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, I <hi>feel,</hi> for Benefits,
too long, and too many, to enumerate.—But becauſe we ſee Things
cleareſt, when oppos'd againſt their <hi>Contraries,</hi> Indulge me but
ſo far, as to tell the World a <hi>Story</hi> for me, which will teach the
Enemies of theſe <hi>Great</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the Publick Good, to value
them, as they ought, and ſee what Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences there is, between
<hi>Them,</hi> and other People.</p>
                  <q> 
                     <p> ONE of the <hi>Turkiſh Sultans,</hi> whoſe Name I have
forgot, taking into his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the Great Fertility of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
was reſolv'd to give Encouragement to the <hi>Trade,</hi> and
<hi>Plantations</hi> of That Country; <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0199100802:352"/> To this End he
ſent over to the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> a SETT of SAGES,
with <hi>great Salaries,</hi> to whom <hi>References</hi> were to be made upon
all Tranſactions, of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And by whoſe <hi>Reports</hi> He was to
guide himſelf, in <hi>Mercantile</hi> and <hi>Commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> Caſes.</p> 
                     <p> IT happen'd, ſoon after their Arrival, that a Petition was
preſented to the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> by the Planters of <hi>Cotton,</hi>
whoſe whole Year's Expectation had been deſtroy'd by an unuſual
Inundation of the <hi>Nile:</hi> In Commiſeration of which deplorable
Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, They humbly pray'd a Remiſſion of the Tax upon Cotton, for That
one Year only.—The <hi>Baſhaw</hi> (according to His Orders) referr'd
This Petition to the <hi>Sages,</hi> who were, <hi>with all convenient Speed,
to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine its Contents, and report their Opinion, what might fitly be done,
upon the Occaſion.</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p> THE <hi>Sages,</hi> juſtly mindful that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
<hi>Salaries,</hi> which were annex'd to their Office, intitled the People, for
whoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement they were appointed, to the moſt affectionate Proofs
of their <hi>Favour,</hi> and <hi>Good Nature,</hi> were not wanting to lay
hold on this inviting Opportunity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Petitioners how Greatly the
Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of ſo able a <hi>Board</hi> of <hi>Counſellors</hi> was
like to conduce to the Intereſt, not only of the Cotton-Planters, but of all
the Plantations, in general.—They, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt humbly certified,
to the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> 
                        <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0199100802:353"/> That the Loſs of the Cotton
appear'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to have been very conſiderable: But ſeem'd rather an
Effect of the <hi>Planter's own Negligence,</hi> than of the <hi>River's
Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> ſince they cou'd not but know, there were many
<hi>Seeds,</hi> and <hi>Grains,</hi> not liable in their Growth, to receive
Damage by <hi>Inundations:</hi> And, in particular, <hi>Wool</hi> they ſaid
was <hi>Water-proof.</hi>—They were therefore humbly of Opinion, That it
wou'd be for the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Plantation-Intereſt,</hi> that no
Regard ſhou'd be ſhown to the Prayer of the Petitioners, ſince they
ought, inſtead of <hi>Cotton</hi> to have SOWN WOOLL, and thereby ſecur'd
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Misfortune, which had ruin'd them.</p>

                  <p> A DEAR Friend of mine having late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt a hopeful and
beloved Child, and remaining inconſolable thereupon, I beg you'll pleaſe to
inſert for the next <hi>Paper,</hi> the following Abſtract of
<hi>PLUTARCH's</hi> Letter to his WIFE, on a like Occaſion. The ſorrowing
Parent is your conſtant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and I know no better Way to calm the
Violence of her Grief, than by convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, by Your Means, and under the
Sanction of your Authority, ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and <hi>familiar</hi> Things,
as flow'd from that Great Man on this melancholy Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Which may, at the
ſame Time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire our Sex with an Ambition, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Virtues of
<hi>PLUTARCH</hi>'s Wife, <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0199100802:357"/> and ſo to deſerve the
Applauſes he gives Her. I am,</p>

                        </head>
                        <p> THE Meſſenger you diſpatched to tell me of the Death of
my little Daughter, it ſeems miſs'd his Way as he was going to
<hi>Athens:</hi> But when I came to <hi>Tanagra,</hi> I heard of it by my
Niece. I ſuppoſe, by this Time, the Funeral is over. I wiſh, that
whatever happens, as well <hi>now,</hi> as <hi>hereafter,</hi> may create you
no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction. But if you have deſignedly let any Thing alone,
depending upon my Judgment, I pray let it be, without <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi> and
<hi>timorous Superſtition,</hi> which I know are far from you. Only, dear
Wife! let <hi>You</hi> and <hi>I</hi> bear <hi>our</hi> Affliction with
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
                        <p> I KNOW very well, and comprehend, <hi>what Loſs</hi> we
have had; but if I ſhould find you <hi>grieve, beyond Meaſure,</hi> this
would trouble me more than the Thing <hi>it ſelf:</hi> For I had my Birth
neither from a <hi>Stock,</hi> nor a <hi>Stone</hi>; and you know it full well;
I having been aſſiſtant to you in the <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of ſo many
Children, which we <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0199100802:358"/> brought up at <hi>Home</hi> under our
<hi>own Care.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> THIS much lamented Daughter was born after Four Sons, which
made me call her by your <hi>own Name</hi>; therefore, I know ſhe was dear to
you; and Grief muſt have a <hi>peculiar Pungency</hi> in a Heart <hi>tenderly
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate</hi> to <hi>Children</hi>; eſpecially when you call to Mind how
<hi>witty</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> ſhe was, void of <hi>Anger,</hi> and not
<hi>querulous:</hi> She was naturally <hi>mild</hi> and
<hi>compaſſionate</hi> to a Miracle; and gave Specimens of her
<hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> towards <hi>any Thing</hi> that had
oblig'd her; for ſhe would pray her Nurſe to give ſuck not only to
<hi>other Children,</hi> but to her very <hi>Play-things</hi>; as it were,
courteouſly inviting them to <hi>her Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and making the beſt Chear
for them ſhe could. Now, my dear Wife, I ſee no Reaſon why
<hi>theſe</hi> and the <hi>like</hi> Things, which delighted us ſo much
when ſhe was alive, ſhould, upon Remembrance of them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us when ſhe
is dead.</p>
                        <p> IT is but juſt, That the ſame Arguments which we have
oftentimes uſed to <hi>others,</hi> ſhould prevail upon
<hi>ourſelves</hi> at <hi>this</hi> ſo <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> a Time; and
that we ſhould not ſupinely ſit down, and overwhelm the Joys we <hi>have
taſted,</hi> with a Multiplicity of <hi>new Griefs.</hi> A vertuous Woman
ought thus to think with herſelf, That the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of the Mind in violent
Grief muſt be calmed by <hi>Patience</hi>; which does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench 
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0199100802:359"/> on the <hi>natural</hi> Love of Parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards then
Children, as many think, but only ſtruggles againſt <hi>diſorderly</hi>
and <hi>irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Paſſions. For, we allow this <hi>Love</hi> of
<hi>Children</hi> to diſcover itſelf, in <hi>lamenting, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for,</hi> and <hi>longing after</hi> them when they are dead. But the
<hi>exceſſive Inclination</hi> to <hi>Grief,</hi> which carries People on
to <hi>unſeemly Exclamations</hi> and <hi>furious Behaviour,</hi> is no
leſs culpable than <hi>luxurious Intemperance.</hi> Yet Reaſon
<hi>ſeems</hi> to plead in its Excuſe; becauſe, inſtead of
<hi>Pleaſure, Sorrow</hi> is an <hi>Ingredient</hi> of the <hi>Crime.</hi>
What can be more Irrational, I pray, than to check <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Laughter,</hi> and yet, give a free Courſe to <hi>Tears,</hi> which flow from
the <hi>ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> FORMERLY, you diſcover'd, on a <hi>like</hi> Occaſion,
great Conſtancy of Mind, when you loſt your <hi>Eldeſt</hi> Son: And
again, when the lovely <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ron</hi> left us. For I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when the News was brought me of
my Son's Death, as I was returning Home with ſome <hi>Friends</hi> and
<hi>Gueſts,</hi> when they beheld <hi>all Things in Order,</hi> and
obſerv'd a <hi>profound Silence</hi> every where (as they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
declared to others) they thought <hi>no ſuch</hi> Calamity had happened, but
that the Report was falſe: So <hi>diſcreetly</hi> had you ſettled the
Affairs of the Houſe at that Time, when no ſmall <hi>Confuſion</hi> and
<hi>Diſorder</hi> might have been expected. And yet you gave <hi>this</hi>
Son <hi>ſuck</hi> yourſelf, and endured the <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0199100802:360"/>
                           <hi>lancing of your Breaſt,</hi> to prevent the ill Effects of a
Contuſion.</p>
                        <p> THESE are Things worthy of a <hi>Generous Woman,</hi> that
<hi>loves</hi> her <hi>Children!</hi> Whereas, we ſee moſt <hi>others</hi>
receive them in their Hands as <hi>Play-things,</hi> with a <hi>Feminine
Mirth</hi> and <hi>Jollity,</hi> and afterwards, if they chance to die, they
drench themſelves in <hi>exceſſive Sorrow.</hi> Not that <hi>this</hi> is
any Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their <hi>Love</hi> (for that <hi>gentle Paſſion</hi> acts
<hi>regularly</hi> and <hi>diſcreetly!)</hi> it proceeds from a
<hi>Deſire</hi> of <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> mixed with a <hi>little natural
Affection,</hi> which renders their Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>barbarous</hi> and
<hi>extravagant.</hi> Which Thing <hi>Aeſop</hi> knew very well, when he
tells the Story of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s giving Honours to the Gods: For it
ſeems <hi>Grief</hi> alſo made <hi>her</hi> Demands; and it was granted,
That ſhe <hi>ſhould be honoured,</hi> but only by Thoſe who were willing,
of <hi>their own Accord,</hi> to do it.</p>
                        <p> AND, indeed, <hi>this</hi> is the Beginning of Sorrow:
Every-body <hi>firſt</hi> gives her <hi>free Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> and after ſhe
is once <hi>ſettled,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>familiar,</hi> ſhe will not be
forced thence with their <hi>beſt Endeavours.</hi> Therefore, ſhe muſt be
reſiſted at her <hi>firſt Approach,</hi> nor muſt we ſurrender the
Fort to her by any <hi>exterior Signs,</hi> whether of <hi>Apparel,</hi> or
<hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> the <hi>Hair,</hi> or any other <hi>ſuch like</hi>
Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of <hi>mournful Weakneſs</hi>; which, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſo
<hi>enervate</hi> the <hi>Mind,</hi> and reduce her to ſuch Streights, that,
quite <hi>dejected</hi> 
                           <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0199100802:361"/> and <hi>beſieged</hi> with
<hi>Grief,</hi> the poor timorous Wretch <hi>dare not</hi> be merry, or ſee
the Light, or eat and drink in Company. The Inconvenience is accompanied by a
<hi>Neglect</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> with whatſoever relates to the
<hi>Elegance</hi> of <hi>Humane Life.</hi>—Whereas, on the contrary, the
Soul, when it is <hi>diſordered,</hi> ought to receive <hi>Aid</hi> from the
<hi>Vigor</hi> of a <hi>healthful Body.</hi> For the <hi>ſharpeſt Edge</hi>
of the <hi>Soul's Grief,</hi> is <hi>rebated,</hi> when the <hi>Body</hi> is in
<hi>Tranquility,</hi> like the Sea in a Calm. But, where from an ill Courſe
of Diet, the Body becomes <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>hot,</hi> ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſupply the Soul with <hi>commodious</hi> and <hi>ſerene Spirits</hi>; but
only breathes forth <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Vapours,</hi> which annoy her with
<hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; there, it is difficult for a Man (tho' never ſo willing)
to recover the <hi>Tranquility</hi> of his <hi>Mind,</hi> after it hath been
diſturbed with ſo many <hi>evil Affections.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> BUT that which is moſt to be dreaded in this Caſe, does
not at all affrighten me; to wit, The <hi>Viſits</hi> of <hi>fooliſh
Women,</hi> and their accompanying You in Your <hi>Tears</hi> and
<hi>Lamentations</hi>; by which they <hi>ſharpen</hi> Grief, not ſuffering
it either of <hi>itſelf,</hi> or by the Help of <hi>others,</hi> to fade and
vaniſh away. For, I am not ignorant how great a Combat you lately entered,
when you aſſiſted the Siſter of <hi>Theon,</hi> and oppoſed the Women
who came running in with <hi>horrid Cries,</hi> bringing <hi>Fewel,</hi> as it
were, to her Paſſion. When Men ſee their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's 
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0199100802:362"/> 
                           <hi>Houſe</hi> on Fire, every one contributes his
utmoſt to <hi>quench</hi> it: But when they ſee the Mind inflamed with
furious Paſſion, they bring <hi>Fewel</hi> to <hi>nouriſh</hi> and
<hi>increaſe</hi> it. When a Man's <hi>Eye</hi> is in Pain, he is not
ſuffered to touch it, tho' the Inflammation provoke him to it, nor will they
that are near him meddle with it. But he who is gall'd with <hi>Grief,</hi>
ſits and expoſes his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper to <hi>every one,</hi> like Waters that
all may poach in; and ſo that which at firſt ſeem'd a <hi>light</hi> or
<hi>trivial Smart,</hi> by much <hi>Fretting</hi> and <hi>Provoking,</hi>
becomes <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>incurable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> I WOULD have you endeavour to call to Mind <hi>that
Time,</hi> when our Daughter was not, as yet, born to us: Then, joining
<hi>that</hi> Time with <hi>this,</hi> argue thus with your ſelf, we are
<hi>now</hi> in the <hi>ſame</hi> Condition as <hi>then:</hi> Otherwiſe,
dear Wife, we ſhall ſeem diſcontented at the <hi>Birth</hi> of our little
Daughter, if we own, that our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were better <hi>before</hi> it.
The <hi>Two Years</hi> of her <hi>Life</hi> are, by no means, to be forgotten,
by us, but to be numbered amongſt our <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> in that they
afforded us an <hi>agreeable Pleaſure.</hi> Shall we not eſteem a
<hi>ſmall Good</hi> becauſe of a <hi>great Evil?</hi> or, Shall we
ungratefully complain againſt Fortune for what ſhe has <hi>actually given
us,</hi> becauſe ſhe has not added <hi>what we wiſh
for?</hi>—Certainly, to ſpeak reverently of the Gods, and to bear our
<hi>lot</hi> with an <hi>even</hi> 
                           <pb n="362" facs="tcp:0199100802:363"/> 
                           <hi>Mind,</hi>
without <hi>accuſing Fortune,</hi> always brings with it a <hi>fair
Reward.</hi> And he, who in ſuch a Caſe, calls <hi>proſperous Things</hi>
to Mind, and, turning his Thoughts from <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>melancholy</hi>
Objects, fixes them on <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> Ones; will either
quite <hi>extinguiſh</hi> his <hi>Grief,</hi> or, by <hi>allaying</hi> it
with <hi>contrary</hi> Sentiments will render it more <hi>feeble.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> TRUE <hi>Happineſs</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>right
Counſels</hi> of the Mind, tending to its own <hi>conſtant
Eſtabliſhment;</hi> and the <hi>Changes</hi> of <hi>Fortune</hi> are of no
great <hi>Importance</hi> to the <hi>Felicity</hi> of our <hi>Life:</hi> if we
are govern'd by <hi>exterior Things,</hi> and, with the Vulgar, have a Regard
to <hi>Caſualties,</hi> we ſuffer <hi>any kind</hi> of Men to be Judges of
our Happineſs, it will certainly ill become us, to accuſe our Life, if,
like a <hi>Book,</hi> it hath but <hi>one Blot</hi> in it, and all the reſt
be <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>candid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> DO not You, therefore take Notice of the Tears and Moans of
<hi>ſuch</hi> as <hi>viſit you,</hi> at <hi>preſent, condoling</hi> your
Misfortune; for their <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Sighs</hi> are but <hi>of
Courſe.</hi> Rather conſider, How happy every one of them eſteemed you
for the <hi>Children you have,</hi> the <hi>Houſe you keep,</hi> and the
<hi>Life you lead.</hi> For it would be an ill thing, while <hi>others</hi>
covet <hi>your</hi> Fortune, tho' <hi>ſullied</hi> with this
<hi>Affliction,</hi> that you ſhould exclaim againſt what you
<hi>enjoy</hi>; and not be ſenſible, from the <hi>Taſte</hi> of
<hi>Affliction</hi> how grateful you ought to be for the Happineſs which
remains <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched.</hi> 
                           <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0199100802:364"/> Or, like ſome, who
collecting all the <hi>defective</hi> Verſes of <hi>Homer,</hi> paſs'd over
at the ſame time, ſo many <hi>excellent Parts</hi> of his Poems: So ſhall
we peeviſhly <hi>complain of,</hi> and <hi>reckon up</hi> the
<hi>Inconveniencies</hi> of our Life, neglecting the <hi>Benefits</hi> thereof?
Or, Shall we imitate <hi>Covetous</hi> and <hi>Sordid</hi> Miſers, who having
heap'd together much Riches, never <hi>enjoy</hi> what they have in
<hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> but <hi>bewail it</hi> inconſolably, if it
chance to be <hi>loſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> BUT, if you lament the poor Girl, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe died
<hi>unmarried,</hi> and without <hi>Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,</hi> you have wherewithal to
comfort your ſelf, in that <hi>You</hi> are defective in none of theſe
Things, having had <hi>Your Share:</hi> And theſe are not to be eſteemed
<hi>great Evils</hi> where they are <hi>wanted,</hi> and <hi>ſmall
Benefits</hi> where they are <hi>enjoyed.</hi> So long as ſhe is gone to a
Place where ſhe feels no <hi>Pain,</hi> ſhe has no Need of our
<hi>Grief:</hi> For, what <hi>Harm</hi> can befall <hi>us</hi> from
<hi>her,</hi> when ſhe is free from all <hi>Hurt?</hi> And, ſurely, the
Loſs of <hi>great Things</hi> abates the Grief, when it is come to this;
<hi>That there is no more Ground of Grief or Care for them.</hi> But thy
<hi>TIMOXENA</hi> was deprived but of <hi>ſmall Matters</hi>; for ſhe had
no Knowledge but of ſuch; neither took ſhe Delight but in ſuch
<hi>ſmall Things.</hi> How then can you ſay, That <hi>that</hi> is taken
from her, which ſhe never was <hi>ſenſible</hi> of, and which never ſo
much as entered into her <hi>Thoughts?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0199100802:365"/> As for what you hear Others ſay, who
perſuade the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> That the Soul when once freed from the Body,
ſuffers no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience or Evil, nor is ſenſible at all; I know, that
<hi>you</hi> are better grounded in the Doctrines delivered down to us from our
<hi>Anceſtors.</hi> For the <hi>Religious Symbols</hi> are well known to us,
who are of the Fraternity: Therefore, be aſſured, That the <hi>Soul,</hi>
being <hi>incapable of Death,</hi> ſuffers in the Body, in the <hi>ſame
Manner</hi> as <hi>Birds</hi> that are kept in a <hi>Cage.</hi> Wherefore, 
<q> 
                              <l>Even when we firſt receive our Breath,</l>

                           </q> Before
too great a Love of <hi>Earthly</hi> Things be engendred in the Soul, and it

                  <p> WHILE I intended to have ſent you an <hi>Eſſay</hi> on
<hi>Plain-Dealing,</hi> I fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Converſation, which furniſhed me
with it, and the Narrative will be thought a more lively Entertainment. The
Society was compoſed of ſome of your old ſtandard Friends, whoſe
agreeable Characters gave Life to your Underſtanding.—I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
thither to have the Honour of being introduced to the <hi>Plain Dealer</hi>;
but, it ſeems, you were taking Obſervations from your Watch-Tower of
<hi>Barbican,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I make no doubt, we ſhall hear
ſomething to our Advantage; and ſo, as it happen'd, I miſs'd the
Pleaſure which had <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0199100802:367"/> been promiſed me. However, as
your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer, I beg to be admitted into the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Correſpondents,
while I inform you, That the Company I met, were the <hi>Clergyman,</hi> the

                  <p> THE good Gentleman in Black, took Occaſion, from our Speaking
of the Title of your Paper, to diſtinguiſh a <hi>Plain Dealer</hi> from a
<hi>Rough Dealer:</hi> That is, a Man, whoſe Knowledge and Generoſity
inſpire him with a Delight in befriending Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, from the brutal
Impertinent, whoſe Ignorance but <hi>affects</hi> Meaning, and prompts him to
ſuppoſe he appears Wiſeſt, when moſt inſufferably Shocking. The

debaſed into Ill-Manners, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity. The Brute, who boaſts of his
<hi>Bluntneſs,</hi> is a loud Cenſurer of other Mens Conduct, and never
right in his own.—His Eloquence is a Froth of Expreſſion, without
Depth, or Perſpicuity.—While his Depravity miſtakes Brutalities for
Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Graces of human Life are rejected by him as Frailties! Becauſe
his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is impenetrably obdurate, he calls Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
<hi>Magnanimity!</hi> Compaſſion for the Afflicted, is a <hi>Weakneſs in
the Mind</hi>; and a Readineſs to forgive Injuries, an <hi>Affectation,</hi>
or <hi>Deficiency</hi> of <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> The <hi>Plain Dealer,</hi> refining <hi>Nature,</hi> by
Principle, acts the Inquiſitor within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0199100802:368"/> and
throws out a Light of Example, as well as Inſtruction, upon the
World.—The Former inſults the Unfortunate with Cenſure; but the
Latter, reproaching only the Proud and Proſperous, <hi>corrodes</hi> not the
Wounds of the Afflicted, by inſiſting on paſt, and irretrievable
Miſcarriges. Yet, by ſome gentle Alluſion to their Actions, he awakens a
Reflection, that can arm them for their future Safety.—We judge of Things
impartially upon a Surprize, by ſuch Compariſon; and, condemning our own
Faults in others, are forced to ſtand ſelf-convicted, when the
<hi>Recoil</hi> is made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves.</p>
                  <p> But the Barbarity of a <hi>profound Pedant</hi> is ſtill
worſe, if poſſible, than that of a <hi>ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Impertinent.</hi> The
Ignorance of the one, can only move us to Contempt; but the Learning of the
other, provokes our Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation. Tho' Envy may hurt Genius, by urging it, in
the Diſguiſe of Flattery, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too ardent and improper Eſſays, yet, in
the dogmatizing Pedant, it has ſhock'd Worth much more fatally at its firſt
ſetting out; and extinguiſh'd a Spirit, which no Encouragement could
re-kindle. A Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ungratefully turns that Force to the Diſcouragement of
Learning, with whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Learning has
arm'd him to make War againſt Ignorance.—While the <hi>Plain
Dealer</hi> reproves, he ſets <hi>Merits</hi> againſt <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> and
the <hi>Luſtre</hi> of the one, deepens the <pb n="368" facs="tcp:0199100802:369"/>
                     <hi>Shade</hi> of the other! To diſplay but the dark Side a Man, either damps
him with a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that incapacitates him for Action, or diſguſts him into
a ſtubborn Indulgence of thoſe Follies he would otherwiſe have grown
aſhamed of. Roughneſs in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, being like Perſecution in
Religion, Proſelytes are gain'd ſooneſt by a gentle Manner of
Perſuaſion; and I am pleas'd with a Saying that is recorded of King
<hi>Henry the Fourth</hi> of <hi>France.—A Drop of Honey draws more
Flies, than a Spoonful of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IN ſhort, the Force of a fine Inſtruction ought to ſtrike
like a Flaſh of Lightning! As the Subtilty of the one, is ſaid to
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Bone, without bruiſing the Fleſh; the other, with a
Surprize of Influence, ſhoots Remorſe thro' the Heart, before the Temper
can be ruffled into a Diſpoſition to repulſe it. In this Light, a
<hi>Plain Dealer</hi> is a Father, or rather a Friend, which is yet
dearer.—A Father may leave us Wealth and Titles, from which we may derive
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Diſtinction; but ſuch a Friend, can teach us to be wiſe,
and Wiſdom illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Obſcurity, and adorns Dignity with an Eminence
ſuperior to that of Fortune; it veſts us too with the nobleſt
<hi>Power,</hi> for it enables us to govern our
Paſſions.—<hi>Alexander</hi> juſtly preferr'd his Maſter
<hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> to his Father <hi>Philip. The King,</hi> ſaid he,

I know, that, in the common Cant, Flattery is ſaid to be <hi>groſs</hi>;
that it is called, The <hi>Craft</hi> of the <hi>Courtier!</hi> The
<hi>Seducer</hi> of <hi>Beauty!</hi> and, The vain Promiſer of a Happineſs,

this Pauſe but could not reſiſt the Pleaſure of liſtening to that
ever-rambling, ever-agreeable Tongue! What Lover (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inchanting
Trifler) would not rather be <hi>flatter'd</hi> into Hope, then abandon'd to
Deſpair by <hi>Plain Dealing?</hi> The Coxcomb delightfully deceives
himſelf, by fancying our very <hi>Denials</hi> to be Tokens of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Favours. The Man of Senſe (who, when a <hi>Lover,</hi> is, of Courſe, to be
<hi>miſtaken</hi>) believes the Charmer, he admires, has a Wit as penetrating
as her Eyes; and, vain of the real Worth he poſſeſſes, becomes Fool
enough, in his Turn, to think <hi>Merit</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to the
Ladies!—Thus, when you flatter <hi>Us,</hi> you appear agreeable, when we
flatter <hi>You,</hi> we ſecure our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; and when we Both flatter
<hi>Ourſelves,</hi> we conſult and preſerve our Quiet. Theſe are
Pleaſures, which <hi>Plain Dealing</hi> would intirely deface, and
aboliſh.</p>
                  <p> BUT, Madam, cried <hi>Ned Volatile,</hi> as Beaus and Ladies
admire Things for their <hi>Novelty,</hi> we Men of Speculation, approve them
moſt for their <hi>Antiquity.</hi>—A Man of Dreſs, is pleas'd with a
Sword-Knot and Cane-String, after the neweſt Faſhion; while a
<hi>Virtuoſo</hi> prefers a ruſty <hi>Roman Javelin</hi> to the White Wand
of a Lord-Treaſurer.—The Herald derives the Honour of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies from
their <hi>Antiquity:</hi> And ſince there can be no Doubt, but
<hi>Flattery</hi> is more <pb n="371" facs="tcp:0199100802:372"/> 
                     <hi>ancient,</hi> it muſt

ſtrong, had been ſoften'd, to appear more <hi>amiable.</hi> But his
Judgment is mix'd with Partiality, and his Wit with Ill-manners. He's impatient
of Contradiction, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, in Self-conceitedneſs, the very Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs he
contemns.—As a <hi>Lover,</hi> his Indecency checks our Regard, and

                  <p> COULD <hi>Plain-Dealing</hi> (obſerv'd the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>)
be forgiven among the <hi>Great,</hi> it would <hi>both adorn</hi> and
<hi>defend</hi> them. On the contrary, <hi>Double Dealing,</hi> which is an
Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are fond of, has been more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Princes, than
the moſt open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Had <hi>Tarquin</hi> never truſted the
Diſſimulation of the Firſt <hi>Brutus,</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of his Race
had been prevented: And, I think, it may eaſily be determined, by the
Unprejudiced, how far the admired Laſt of that Name deviated from his
boaſted <hi>Honeſty,</hi> when he conſpired againſt the Man whoſe
Intereſt he eſpouſed, and whoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Affection had pardon'd,
promoted, and confided in him; when, in the Perſon of that God-like
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> he aſſaſſinated his <hi>Father,</hi> his

Sentiments, in my Turn; and ventur'd to interpoſe as follows.—Were
<hi>Plain Dealing</hi> a Court Vertue, it would free great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from the
Miſery of a vain Dependance, and avoid the Reſentment of thoſe, whom
<hi>Double Dealing</hi> diſappoints, or makes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of. Greatneſs
proves often too weak a Protection; for the meaneſt Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary may become

<hi>Cunning,</hi> if <hi>Honeſty</hi> may be allowed the <hi>ſafeſt</hi>
Principle of <hi>Policy</hi>; there is then this Difference betwixt <hi>Double
Dealing</hi> and <hi>Plain Dealing</hi>; The one, confounds Families and
Kingdoms, and renders the Guilty, when diſcover'd, deteſtable, even in the
Grave: The other confirms Juſtice, baniſhes Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt from

                  <p> I AM a Young Fellow, left by my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents without any
Proviſion, beſides that of a good Education; nor have I any Proſpect of
Fortune, but what I may, by the Aſſiſtance of that, hope to raiſe in my
Profeſſion. You will certainly think I had other Buſineſs to mind, than
being <hi>in Love</hi>; and yet, Sir, that is the Cauſe of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Application.—I muſt own myſelf not able to withſtand the Charms of
a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Young Lady, who is one of your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. She is at once,
Miſtreſs of the greateſt <hi>Senſe, Knowledge, Wit,</hi> and
<hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0199100802:375"/> 
                     <hi>Temper</hi>; Qualities,
<hi>each</hi> of which by itſelf (poſſeſs'd to that eminent Degree,
ſhe now enjoys them <hi>all</hi>) were ſufficient to make whomſoever
ſhe honours with her Choice, <hi>compleatly happy!</hi> She has, for ſome
Time, admitted me to the Favour of viſiting her, and treats me, on all
Occaſions, with the greateſt Civility. I have heard her often ſay, She
thought <hi>the Law</hi> (to which, by this Time, you perceive I belong) the
moſt <hi>Genteel,</hi> and <hi>Honourable,</hi> of all Profeſſions; That
ſhe never would marry for <hi>Money</hi>;—And a Hundred ſuch Things,
that a young Fellow, as I am, is naturally vain enough to conſtrue into
<hi>Encouragements.</hi> But, Sir, ſhe is a great <hi>Fortune</hi>; and you
know what <hi>Ridicule</hi> a Young Man, <hi>without any,</hi> meets with, who
makes Addreſſes of that Kind, and comes off unſucceſsfully.—I
deſire, therefore, you would take an Opportunity, in one of your Papers, to
let her know, That if ſhe has any ſuch Thoughts, as my Wiſhes have
flattered my Hopes into a <hi>Suſpicion</hi> of, Her Advances ought to be a
great deal <hi>more,</hi> than is uſually judged reaſonable: For while I
have the leaſt <hi>Doubt</hi> of her Inclinations, I had rather die a
Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Deaths,</hi> than, by a miſtaken Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, run the
Hazard of loſing, what alone can make <hi>Life</hi> valuable, to,</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>

               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:0199100802:376"/>THE Caſe of my Correſpondent is pretty
nice, and as this ſeems to be a Matter of the greateſt Importance to both
Parties, I think I cannot beſtow a Paper better, than in taking it into
Conſideration, and in giving ſome Advice, that may be of Service to all,
who are in the ſame Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>IF we conſider the Affair of <hi>Marriage,</hi> as it is now
generally carried on in the World, there are innumerable Difficulties, which
damp purſuits of that Kind, in a Young Fellow, who, let him deſerve ever
ſo well in other Reſpects, wants (what the World <hi>alone</hi> eſteems
<hi>Merit)</hi> an ESTATE.</p>
            <p>SOME of theſe Difficulties ariſe from the <hi>Women
themſelves.</hi>—There are few among them to be found, who have any
Notion of Enjoyments, beyond mere <hi>ſenſual</hi> Gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A
<hi>Maſquerade</hi> affords them infinitely more Pleaſure, than the
brighteſt Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a <hi>Diamond</hi> has more Charms, than any of
the moral Virtues; and, I doubt not, there are ſome, who, for the Sake of
riding in a Coach and Six, would Yoke themſelves with a <hi>verier
Beaſt,</hi> than any in their <hi>own Equipage.</hi> Let any one Traffick
with them for the dear Delights of <hi>Wealth,</hi> they will <hi>buy,</hi>
even at the <hi>higheſt Price</hi>;—That is, They will pay the
Purchaſe in what they prize moſt—<hi>Themſelves.</hi>—And,
tho' hardly any Match, on theſe Conſiderations alone, has ever yet proved
happy, They ſtill <pb n="376" facs="tcp:0199100802:377"/> go on;—Notwithſtanding they
are ſure to <hi>repent,</hi> They never fail to make the <hi>Choice.</hi>

            <q> 
               <l>How wretched is the faithful Youth,</l>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>OTHER Women there are, indeed, whoſe Minds, of a leſs
mercenary Caſt, conſider only the <hi>Merit</hi> of their Admirers; who are
capable of receiving that Love which flows from <hi>Eſteem,</hi> and of
taſting Happineſs from <hi>rational Enjoyments.</hi> But, how few of
theſe enjoy the Liberty of <hi>chooſing for themſelves?</hi> How many
groan under the Tyranny of an Avaritious Parent? who would no more part with
his Daughter, than his Land, to any but the <hi>beſt Purchaſer.</hi> How
would he <hi>Scoff</hi> at a Young Man's Impudence? who, inſtead of paying
<hi>Her Price,</hi> ſhould pretend to talk of Her <hi>Happineſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM thus much of the Sex, then, <hi>Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Merit</hi>
ſeems intirely excluded. The Woman who has <hi>Liberty,</hi> as well as
<hi>Capacity,</hi> to make a prudent Choice, is the only one with whom we can
hope Succeſs. And here ariſe new Difficulties, from another Side; The
<hi>Men</hi> are <hi>now</hi> our Hindrance, and one in my Correſpondent's
Circumſtances, muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>himſelf</hi> to ſuffer for the general
ill Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his <hi>Sex.</hi> Men daily ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves 
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0199100802:378"/> as little <hi>diſintereſted,</hi> in their
Purſuits, as Women. <hi>Age, Folly,</hi> and <hi>Ill-Nature,</hi> are no
Impediments to them, provided there be but <hi>Money.</hi>—Love, and
Eſteem, are ſo frequently uſed as Pretences, while the real Affection is
only for the Fortune, that Women are alarm'd at the firſt Approach; and a
Young Fellow dares hardly Love, where Prudence only permits him to Love,
without incurring the odious Title of a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-hunter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF therefore my Correſpondent ſincerely feels, within
himſelf, that diſintereſted Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which he ſeems to act by, I
would adviſe him to take all poſſible Methods to <hi>convince</hi> the
Lady of it; I need not direct him <hi>how</hi>; for, if he is ſincere, his
Paſſion will diſcover it ſelf in every Word and Action. But by no means
let him be <hi>haſty,</hi> in his Addreſſes.—With a Lady of her
Senſe, his <hi>Modeſty</hi> will add much to his <hi>Influence.</hi> True
Love ſprings not upon a ſudden, and ſhould he urge his Wiſhes, too far,
before her <hi>Inclination</hi> has improv'd itſelf into <hi>Affection,</hi>
ſhe might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conſtrue his Forwardneſs to proceed from other
Motives, than the genuine Effects of his perſonal, and diſintereſted,
Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>ON the other Side, I muſt take upon me to remind the Young Lady,
that <hi>Time</hi> is more in haſte, than <hi>ſhe</hi> is; and I would
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe her, if ſhe is (as I preſume) at her own Diſpoſal, and if
ſhe is ſatisfied of the <hi>Merit,</hi> 
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:0199100802:379"/> as well as
the Affection, of our Young Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer (as one of the Senſe he aſcribes to
her, may ſoon be) not to <hi>demur</hi> upon his Want of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
Happineſs in Marriage, does not depend on Suitableneſs of
<hi>Eſtates,</hi> but of <hi>Tempers.</hi> If there be but a Competency on
<hi>one</hi> Side, no matter on which it lies.—<hi>Love,</hi> indeed,
ſhould be <hi>reciprocal,</hi> but there is no Neceſſity, that
<hi>Fortune</hi> ſhould. There is <hi>This more</hi> to be conſidered,
That, beſides the Happineſs of an agreeable Partner for Life, which ſhe
will enjoy, in <hi>common</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> ſhe will have the Addition
of a <hi>ſuperior</hi> Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in the noble, and ever-pleaſing
Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, That ſhe has intitled herſelf, as well to his

                  <p> I AM ſeldom negligent, in my Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at the
Coffee-Houſe, upon thoſe Days, when you favour the World with your
Lectures;—You very prudently entertain us, with a great deal of
<hi>Variety:</hi> Which is, doubtleſs, the moſt ready, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Means of <hi>Improvement.</hi> For, if you altogether treated about Religious
or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duties, you would be diſregarded by your <hi>gay</hi> Readers, and
reliſh'd only by your <pb n="383" facs="tcp:0199100802:384"/> 
                     <hi>Rational.</hi> But as we are
ignorant of what you will diſcourſe, 'till we take up your Papers, we may,
out of Curioſity, be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares catched, by an <hi>Admonition</hi> in
<hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade,</hi> under the Diſguiſe of a mere
Amuſement.—</p>
                  <p> YOU have indulged no obſcene, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral Reflections: But
have, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, diſcountenanced <hi>Vice</hi>; and ſupported
Religion, with Vivacity, and Frankneſs of Spirit; conſequently, the
<hi>Inconſiderate</hi> may, by Degrees, be awakened into an Exertion of the
<hi>Thinking Faculty</hi>; by which chiefly we are diſtinguiſhed, and
ſupport our boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Superiority, over the <hi>brutal</hi> Creation. A
virtuous Reader of your Paper can at worſt but be render'd <hi>chearful,</hi>
without Violation of his <hi>Innocence.</hi>—And your Writings being
generally <hi>pleaſing,</hi> and very often <hi>uſeful,</hi> I flatter my
ſelf, That Men are not ſo aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to Ignorance, as we are ready to
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, ſince they give ſuch a kind Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you Eſſays, which
have no mean, or ungenerous Gratifications to recommend them.—</p>
                  <p> I LEARN, from your <hi>Plain Dealing,</hi> to be inoffenſive
in Converſation; I obſerve all that paſſes, wherever I happen to be;
and endeavour, at the ſame Time, to <hi>contract</hi> or <hi>extend</hi> my
ſelf, till I am grown <hi>fit</hi> for my Company. Though, by the Way, we
ſhould reſolutely preſerve this moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Steadineſs, on
no Account whatever, to</hi> 
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0199100802:385"/> 
                     <hi>humour a Friend at the
Expence of our Health, our Reputation, or our Virtue.</hi> FRIEND, did I ſay?
I retract the Appellation;—For certainly, if we think right, that
Perſon who ſolicites us to Actions inconſiſtent with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with
Honour, or with Decency, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving of ſo ſublime a
Character.—But (this ſingle Exception allow'd for) we ſhould
condeſcend to appear blind to the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of thoſe we converſe
with—And he, who acts otherwiſe, will juſtly incur the Cenſure of
an odious, and ſcornful Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.—A Man's <hi>firſt</hi> Care
ſhould be to avoid the Reproaches of his own Heart, and his <hi>ſecond</hi>
to eſcape the ill Wiſhes of other People.</p>
                  <p> WE learn, with Delight, from ſuch <hi>Plain Dealing</hi> as
yours, That a wiſe Man's Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to ſubdue the Roughneſs of
Paſſion, into the Calmneſs of a tranquil Humility; And that the more his
Knowledge is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd, the more he will perceive <hi>wanting,</hi> to be
ſearch'd after. <hi>Tully</hi> tells us, The Mind of a wiſe Man never
<hi>ſwells,</hi> nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>elated.</hi> For my own Part, I fancied my
ſelf, when I was young, to be acquaint- with every Thing: But now, I can
perceive my Learning contracted with a narrow Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and almoſt obſcured
in a <hi>dark Point</hi>; when compared with that infinite, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible Number of Subjects, to which I am an utter Stranger. In a
Word, I am convinced, That an ill-grounded Conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs 
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0199100802:386"/> of our own Abilities is the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Weakneſs of Nature: And, even where it may ſeem juſtified, by our real
Merit, it renders odious, and ſupportable, the very <hi>Virtue,</hi> which
Occaſions it.</p>
                  <p> BUT, to make a Tranſition, from what <hi>I learn from</hi>
you, to an Information I intend to <hi>give you</hi>; There is a pretty Maxim
in the <hi>Guardian,</hi> to <hi>think</hi> with the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> but
<hi>talk</hi> with the <hi>Vulgar</hi>: Which occurr'd ſtrongly to my Memory,
upon obſerving with what Pleaſure your late <hi>Cambridge</hi> Letter,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome little feminine Exravagancies, was received in all
Places.—Give me Leave, therefore, to entertain you with a ſtrange, and
fearful Diſcovery, which, it was lately my Fortune to make, upon paſſing
a Night or Two, in a Country Village.—It was in a Ramble, laſt
Harveſt, I had the Honour to wait on a <hi>Widow,</hi> (as well
<hi>ſtor'd</hi> as the <hi>Fields</hi> were) in a kind of
<hi>Progreſs,</hi> to viſit her Tenants.—</p>
                  <p> AFTER Dinner, one Day, I left the good Company, with their
honeſt Entertainers, the Farmer and his narrative Family, to accompany the
<hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>Yard</hi>; and enjoy the ſilent Serenity of a
very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Proſpect; which was bounded by the Shade of Trees and Hills,
with ruin'd Buildings, at a little Diſtance from the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.—I was
envying the Happineſs, and Quiet, of theſe unbuſy People; and had
wander'd, as it were inſenſibly, over half a <pb n="386" facs="tcp:0199100802:387"/> Dozen
Stiles, into the Remoteneſs of a hollow ſandy way: Where I ſtood with
great Delight, to obſerve the Fall of a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Rill,</hi> which
guſhing out from among the Ruſhes above, roll'd down the ſandy Bank, and
ſhap'd it ſelf a Paſſage, along the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Road I walk'd in.
The Gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was ſpread all round, had fitted this Place, above all
I had ever ſeen, for the Abode of fantaſtick Melancholly: And whilſt I
was buſied in Thoughts of this Nature, I ſaw a Country Woman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
towards me, who wav'd her Hand, as ſhe came forward, and cried out to me, to
<hi>walk on.—For I was ſtanding at Gooddy</hi> Hubbard<hi>'s watering
Place!</hi>—</p>
                  <p> AS ſoon as the good Woman came near enough to be ask'd,
<hi>What ſhe meant,</hi> I found, that Gooddy <hi>Hubbard</hi> was a
<hi>Witch,</hi> that lived in the Wood: And, that if any <hi>Cow, Horſe,</hi>
or other Cattle, ſtaid long enough in that Place, to drink of its
<hi>enchanted Water,</hi> All the Hay they ſhould eat, from that Time
forward, would be turned into <hi>crooked Pins,</hi> and the poor Beaſts
muſt certainly <hi>die after it.</hi> I begged ſhe would go along with me,
to ſhew me the Witch's Houſe: To which Propoſition ſhe replied, with
inexpreſſible Conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>She would not, for the World, be ſo
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous:</hi> She added, That it was about half a Mile off, and ſhook
her Head, and aſſured me, that the whole Village trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled 
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0199100802:388"/> at the Sight of this <hi>Goody Hubbard.</hi> That, for
her own Part very lately, as ſhe was Gleaning in a Field, by the Wood's Side,
the Witch had appeared to her out of the Hedge, in the Shape of the Leaf of a
Tree: And ran along before her, and play'd Gambols, over and over in her Path,
all the Way, as ſhe came home again.—I ask'd her, Whether ſhe had
found any ill Conſequence, after ſo terrible an Accident? And ſhe
anſwer'd, (with great Innocence and Gravity) That ſhe had but too much
Reaſon to believe, ſhe was <hi>bewitched,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many
<hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>wicked Thoughts</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ever Day in her Head,
about Things ſhe had never been troubled with, (till that unfortunate Leaf
fell in her way) ſince ſhe was a <hi>Maid,</hi> or but little better.</p>
                  <p> I COULD not reſiſt the Temptation, which theſe ſilly
Stories left me under, of making a <hi>Viſit</hi> to the formidable
<hi>Gooddy Hubbard</hi>; whom I found, in a little Hovel, which the Charity of
the Lord of the Manor had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be built for her, in the Wood; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the honeſt People of the Village, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken it into their Heads to make a
<hi>Witch</hi> of the poor old Woman, fell upon her, as often as ſhe came in
their Way: And had two or three times endangered her Life, by ſcratching her
with their Nails, till every Body had <hi>fetch'd Blood</hi> of her, (as the
Phraſe is) after which, it ſeems, no <hi>Witch,</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
has Power to hurt a Hair of any Perſon's Head, who takes this effectual Way
to <hi>diſarm</hi> her,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:0199100802:389"/> I CAME off, with no other Damage, than
the Loſs of all the Money I had in my Pocket; which the Influence of
downright Compaſſion compelled me to leave behind, for the Comfort of an
afflicted Creature, whoſe unſupported Age, and Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inſtead
of the <hi>Relief</hi> or <hi>Pity,</hi> which was due to them by
<hi>Nature,</hi> had procur'd her the malicious Rage, and Perſecution, of
<hi>unthinking Ignorance!</hi>—I return'd to my <hi>Widow</hi>; and after
a long and pleſant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, on the Subject of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi>
agreed heartily with her, That there were <hi>ſuch Things as Witches</hi>;
and took upon me to aſſure, with a <hi>Sigh,</hi> and a <hi>downcaſt
Eye,</hi> That I had, <hi>my ſelf,</hi> ſuffer'd, ſo ſeverely, by one
of them, that I never expected to become my <hi>own Man</hi> again; though I
ſhould live to the Age of a <hi>Patriarch.</hi>—</p>

Gentlemen of <hi>Rome</hi> were contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Scheme to have more of their
La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies good Company at home, the <hi>Women roſe up in Arms,</hi> to the
great Surprize of the <hi>Roman</hi> State; That they denied the
<hi>Senators</hi> a free Paſſage to the Houſe: And, that <hi>Cato</hi> by
Name, had like to have been <hi>carried off</hi> by the <hi>Mob.</hi> They
claimed, as their ancient <hi>Rights,</hi> and undoubted <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,</hi>
almoſt as ſtrange Things, as your <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> does, in her late
Scheme for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a <hi>Female Parliament.</hi> However, upon a
<hi>Parly</hi> between both Parties, the <hi>Women</hi> ſubmitted the Caſe
to the <hi>Senate:</hi> Where, they always carried the <hi>Majority,</hi>
though 'tis well known, no Lady ſate in <pb n="390" facs="tcp:0199100802:391"/>
                     <hi>Houſe.</hi> Nor was that at all ſurprizing: For if we examine
Hiſtory, I believe, we ſhall find, the <hi>Senate,</hi> at that Time,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted more of <hi>Wits,</hi> than of <hi>Wiſe Men</hi>; over whom,
for the ſake of <hi>Politeneſs,</hi> the <hi>Women</hi> muſt have moſt
Influence; nor is it leſs probable, that their being in Arms might
<hi>frighten</hi> the <hi>old</hi> Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p> THE Uſe of <hi>Bribery</hi> likewiſe, had then newly been
found out; and, I dare ſay, there was no Lady, who had not about her,
<hi>wherewithal</hi> to <hi>purchaſe a Vote.</hi> Such was the Courage of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Ladies of old: And how exactly our <hi>Moderns</hi> imitate
them, is, I believe, too plain to need de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing: Happy, therefore it is,
and much for the <hi>Peace of Great Britain,</hi> that our Parliament has never
attempted the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their exorbitant <hi>Hoops,</hi> or the
Abridgement of their <hi>Pin-Money!</hi> For my Part I muſt frankly
confeſs, I have no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to make againſt Mrs. <hi>Patty Amble</hi>'s
Propoſal. Other Men may have their <hi>Fears,</hi> from the ſuppoſed
<hi>Conſequences</hi> of a <hi>Female Parliament</hi>: But, I think, they are
<hi>out</hi> in their <hi>Politicks.</hi>—If a Power grows always
<hi>weaker,</hi> the more it is <hi>divided,</hi> Let <hi>me</hi> be a
<hi>Republican,</hi> in <hi>Love,</hi> and chuſe rather to pay Obebience to
<hi>Five Hundred</hi> of theſe pretty COMMONS; that live a <hi>Slave,</hi> to
<hi>One, Sole</hi> TYRANT; and neither <hi>enjoy,</hi> nor dare <hi>talk</hi>
of, my <hi>Liberty.</hi>—Alas, Sir! This is exactly the preſent Caſe

            <p>I FELL lately into Company with a Claſs of young Poets, who
affect to be Admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Taſſo,</hi> and were Extravagant in their
Praiſe of a <hi>Simile,</hi> in his <hi>Gieruſalemme,</hi> where the
<hi>Devil,</hi> maligning the Succeſs of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Arms, is
ſaid, To <hi>bite his Lips, and ſpurn up the Floor of Hell, in bellowing
Rage, like a wild Bull, when the Dogs are baiting him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY made me promiſe, That I would give them my impartial
Opinion; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they earneſtly preſs to know it, I will borrow the
Reflections of a Friend, on the Subject of <hi>Similes, in general</hi>; which
contain whatever I would ſay, were I to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of
this great Ornament to Poetry; than which there is nothing more capable of
being made either <hi>delightful</hi> or <hi>ridiculous,</hi> according as it
is uſed, diſcreetly, or at random.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:0199100802:393"/>THE Uſe, which a Poet ought to make of
<hi>Compariſons,</hi> is to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> the Object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented;
that is, to enlighten and enlarge the Apprehenſion of the Reader. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
therefore, of the Thing, which is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi> muſt correſpond
exactly with what it is <hi>compared to:</hi> There muſt not only be an
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent <hi>Reſemblance,</hi> but a viſible <hi>Proportion.</hi> A Thing
<hi>low,</hi> and <hi>inconſiderable,</hi> may be <hi>like</hi> enough to
ſomething <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>magnificent</hi>; but then, wanting Dignity
to appear in its Company, no Poet of Judgment ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to make Uſe
of it.—I will give the Reader an Inſtance of a very remarkable Fault of
this Kind;—Sir <hi>Richard Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> in his <hi>Prince
Arthur,</hi> has been pleaſed to compare the Devil, looking down from a
Mountain, on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Camp, to a <hi>Toad,</hi> on the Border of
a Walk looking up at the Gardener.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>While, with malignant Eyes, th' Apoſtate view'd</l> 
               <l>Their Hoſt, with <hi>Octa</hi>'s Meſſage pleas'd, he
ſtood,</l> 
               <l>Stung deep with Malice, and with Envy torn,</l> 
               <l>While all his <hi>Veins,</hi> like <hi>Aetna</hi>'s Furnace,
burn.</l>
            </q>
            <p>THE <hi>Veins</hi> of the Devil, I ſuppoſe, were not ſo much
owing to Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, that he was deſcribing a
<hi>Spirit</hi>; as to a politick Deſign of reducing <hi>Satan</hi> to
downright <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> that the Reader, conceiving a
more humble Opinion of him, than he had been taught in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, 
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0199100802:394"/> might be the better prepar'd for the <hi>Toad</hi> in
the Compariſon.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>And Streams of Fire, from his red Eye-balls flow'd,</l> 
               <l>Like Light'ning, breaking from a low'ring Cloud:</l> 
               <l>As when a <hi>Toad,</hi> ſquat on a Border, ſpies</l> 
               <l>The Gard'ner paſſing by, his Bloodſhot Eyes,</l> 
               <l>With Spite, and Rage inflam'd, dart Fire around</l> 
               <l>The verdant Walks, and on the flow'ry Ground,</l> 
               <l>The bloated Vermin loathſome Poiſon ſpits,</l> 
               <l>And ſwoln, and burſting with his Hatred, ſits:</l> 
               <l>
                  <hi>So</hi> the <hi>fall'n Angel,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>FALLEN</hi> indeed, if no abler to do Harm to Sir
<hi>Richard</hi>'s Hero, than his <hi>Toad</hi> to the Gardener! Where is the
terrible <hi>Power,</hi> the wily reſtleſs <hi>Malice,</hi> the inſatiate
revengeful <hi>Application,</hi> of this dangerous Enemy to Mankind, in Sir
<hi>Richard</hi>'s <hi>humble Simile?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Toad</hi> may be <hi>poiſonous,</hi> but then he may be
<hi>trod upon,</hi> which is by no Means, the Caſe of the <hi>Devil.</hi> If
a Poet, who introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Satan,</hi> thus <hi>inraged,</hi> would imagine a
Compariſon, to aggrandize the Horror of his Reader's Conception, it muſt
certainly ariſe from nothing, which we are to look <hi>down</hi> upon; no
little, venomous, inconſiderable Creature; The Elements ſhould War
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on ſuch Occaſions, as theſe; the Skies ſhould blaze with
Lightning; the World reel with Earthquakes; the Sea riſe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the
Poles crack with Thunder; and <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0199100802:395"/> all <hi>Nature</hi> groan,
with Variety of Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.—<hi>Toad, Poiſon, Squat, Bloated,
Spits, Vermin, Loathſome, Swoln, Burſting!</hi> What Image can ariſe from
ſuch Expreſſions as theſe, which is either <hi>like,</hi> or
<hi>agreeable?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO ſay Truth, no <hi>Simile</hi> at all ſhould have been
introduced in the Place I have been complaining againſt: The natural
Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Reader, can repreſent to his <hi>Fancy</hi> the Idea of the
Devil, looking angry from a Mountain, much better, than any common Image, of
Things known, can repreſent it to his <hi>Memory.</hi> A Compariſon is
never to be made, but where the Object to be deſcribed is leſs known, or
leſs conceivable, than ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, which, being of equal Grandeur
and Importance, will alſo illuſtrate, and rivet it on the
Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>THE Deſcriptions, and Similes, which we meet with in
<hi>Milton,</hi> give us quite other Ideas of this dreadful Rebel-Angel.</p>
            <q> 
               <l>Scarce had he ceas'd, when the ſuperior Fiend</l>

               <l>Behind him caſt, the broad Circumference</l> 
               <l>Hung on his Shoulders, like the <hi>Moon,</hi>

            <p>

                  <l>Forth came in Order the infernal Peers,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And again,

                  <l>—<hi>Satan,</hi> above the Reſt,</l>

                  </l>

            </p>
            <p>HAVING named Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> I am well enough aware, That Sir
<hi>Richard</hi> may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Juſtification from <hi>that</hi> great
Poet's Example; who has made Uſe, in another Place, of this very Simile of a

pray, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with what Difference, as well in the Occaſion, as the
Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SATAN,</hi> after having changed himſelf into many different

            <q> 
               <l>So ſaying, on he led his radiant Files,</l> 
               <l>Dazling the Moon; Theſe to the Bower direct,</l> 
               <l>In Search of whom they ſought. Him there they found,</l> 
               <l>
                  <hi>Squat,</hi> like a <hi>Toad,</hi> cloſe at the

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>BESIDES his Neceſſity of providing againſt
<hi>Diſcovery,</hi> (of which he was in no Danger in Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s
Poem) he takes the Shape of a <hi>Toad,</hi> as moſt proper, while
<hi>Eve</hi> was aſleep, to approach her cloſely, concealed among the

            <q>

            </q>
            <p>OBSERVE here, that the Devil is in no <hi>Rage,</hi> when thus
compared; but, on the contrary, under much <hi>Terror,</hi> and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>deceive</hi> and <hi>circumvent,</hi> and therefore obliged in Policy,
to aſſume that Form, which was rather ſuitable to his <hi>End,</hi> than

               <l>Touch of Celeſtial Temper, but returns</l> 
               <l>Perforce to its own Likeneſs—Up he ſtarts,</l> 
               <l>Diſcover'd, and ſurpriz'd! As when a Spark</l>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>NOTHING of this is <hi>little,</hi> nothing
<hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing:</hi> The whole is natural, terrible, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick,
ſurprizing, and becoming the Dignity of the Subject, it relates to.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Simile,</hi> ſhould, if poſſible, be <hi>alike,</hi>
in all its Parts; It is enough, that ſome <hi>one</hi> Quality of the
Compariſon reſemble ſome <hi>one</hi> Part, or Nature of the Object it is
compared to.—<hi>Homer</hi> has been infinitely guilty of this Error;
hurried, as it were, away with the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of his Imagination, he ſeldom
ſtaid to weigh any more of a Simile, than that very Part of it, which
ſuited his Purpoſe; not mindful enough, that upon ſtarting an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to
which many Qualities are common, the Apprehenſion of the Reader, is not,
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, at Leiſure to examine which <hi>particular</hi> Quality includes
the <hi>Reſemblance,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſcerns not any Likeneſs at
all, but with ſuch Trouble, and Application, as totally deſtroy the very
End of a <hi>Simile.</hi> For if the <pb n="398" facs="tcp:0199100802:399"/> Deſign of this
Ornament be to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> it ought not
certainly to be found <hi>obſcure</hi> in <hi>itſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is, in the noble <hi>Greek</hi> Poet above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, a
famous Compariſon of <hi>Ajax,</hi> who retreats ſlow, from an overpowering
Crowd of <hi>Trojans</hi>; to an <hi>Aſs</hi> in an <hi>Encloſure,</hi>
ſurrounded and beaten by the Sticks of the Village, but walking gravely,
notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, toward the Gap, he came in at, and ſtopping very
frequently, to <hi>eat,</hi> in his Way: Monſieur <hi>Dacier, Boſſu,</hi>
and all the <hi>French</hi> Criticks, who are not Converts to Monſieur
<hi>Perault</hi>'s Obſervations, have taken a great deal of Pains to
juſtify this Simile of <hi>Homer</hi>'s; But, in my Opinion, they are all
miſtaken, not only in the <hi>Defence,</hi> but in the very
<hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation:</hi> It is not ſo much the <hi>Aſs,</hi> that
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Blame, ſince he was in thoſe Days a <hi>Beaſt</hi> of Great
<hi>Quality:</hi> It is rather, that the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is <hi>partial,</hi>
where it ought to have been <hi>total.</hi>—The <hi>ſtiff, reluctant,
Receding</hi> of <hi>Ajax</hi> from his Enemies, is certainly well hit, in the
Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of the <hi>Aſs</hi>; but where is that Part of the Compariſon,
which ſhould enliven to our Imaginations, his frequent Return to Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
His Impatience of Soul? That Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Indignation, and revengeful
Intrepidity, which the Poet's <hi>Deſcription</hi> had alſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us to
expect in his <hi>Simile?</hi> The <hi>Aſs,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, was <hi>loth
to depart,</hi> as <hi>Ajax,</hi> but he was neither ſo apt to be
<hi>angry,</hi> nor ſo dangerous, if he became ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:0199100802:400"/>COMPARISONS, to conclude this Reflection,
can never be proper in <hi>Paſſions,</hi> or violent Emotions of Mind; The
Imagination is then too much tranſported, and inflamed, to caſt about for
<hi>cool Reſemblances.</hi> But in the Mouth of the Poet, that is to ſay,
in the Courſe of the <hi>Narration,</hi> and not in the <hi>Speeches,</hi>
they are beautiful, and neceſſary. They <hi>deſcribe</hi> Paſſion
well, though they do not <hi>expreſs</hi> it: And, to ſay all in a Word,
Where <hi>Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone</hi> appears too weak to imprint an Idea on the
Mind of a Reader, there the only effectual Remedy is to have Recourſe to a
<hi>Simile.</hi>

            <p>SINCE <hi>Love,</hi> which, in both Sexes, is the moſt
irreſiſtable of our Paſſions, has its ſtrongeſt Influence on
<hi>Woman</hi>; I cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obſerve That Cruelty and malicious
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageneſs of <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> which actuates the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
againſt thoſe whom they conſider as <pb n="400" facs="tcp:0199100802:401"/> their
<hi>Rivals,</hi> without inwardly lamenting the Weakneſs of their Minds; who
had rather be <hi>lovely,</hi> than <hi>happy</hi>; and while they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their pretty Hearts with a Thouſand <hi>Alarms,</hi> and
<hi>Suſpicions,</hi> never take it into their Heads to <hi>diſcover,</hi>
That they hate the Object of their Reſentment, for only <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>loving as They do</hi>; and that what they are <hi>purſuing</hi> with
<hi>Revenge,</hi> ought, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be <hi>met,</hi> with

<hi>Moderation,</hi> ſeems to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd, in this Particular, by the noble
Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Two Ladies, from One of which I have had the Pleaſure to receive
a Letter, ſo intirely <hi>new,</hi> and writ with ſo much <hi>natural</hi>
Force, and Sweetneſs, that it is impoſſible the Reader ſhou'd not feel
the ſame Effect from it, that I did.—I ſuppreſs, for the ſake of
<hi>Modeſty,</hi> and not without ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, and Mortification to my
<hi>Vanity,</hi> an introductory Paragraph, fill'd with the moſt obliging,
and gentile, Praiſes of the PLAIN DEALER; and haſten, at once, into the
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Letter.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p> I AM led, (obſerves this charming Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent) to
imagine <hi>Friendſhip</hi> the Favourite Paſſion of your Soul, becauſe
your Sentiments ſeem finely turn'd for it.—<hi>Mine</hi> too, as far as
its inferior Faculties permit, is truly ſenſible of, and devoted to
it.—But I never felt it ſo forcibly, as I <pb n="401" facs="tcp:0199100802:402"/> did
the other Day, in a Viſit, which I made to a young Lady, a dear and intimate
Friend, in the Country.</p>
                  <p> SHE retir'd from me, not long ſince, to indulge a ſilent
Grief, which I, and every Body, had taken Notice of, but which ſhe had
endeavour'd to conceal from her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, with a Care, as earneſt, as it
was vain. For her Eyes, and alter'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, made it evident to all, who
loved her, and therefore delighted to look on her, that there was ſomething
at her Heart, too melancholy for <hi>Solitude,</hi> and yet too
<hi>engag'd</hi> for <hi>Society.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> THE Privilege of our Intimacy intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to her Chamber,
without No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or Ceremony; where I found her, writing, and
<hi>alone.</hi>—The Subject, which her Thoughts were fill'd with, had
fixed her in ſo profound an Attention, that it gave me Freedom and
Opportunity, to ſtand a while, and obſerve the beautiful Diſtreſs of
her Mind, which was <hi>loſt</hi> and labour'd in a <hi>meaning
Sadneſs,</hi> and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her from ſeeing, or ſuppoſing, that there
was any Body ſo near her.</p>
                  <p> NEVER was <hi>Sorrow</hi> ſo Majeſtical! ſo ſweetly
<hi>Noble!</hi>—Her lively Features were ſoften'd into a
<hi>Languiſhment,</hi> that was love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, than <hi>Health,</hi> and more
charming, than <hi>Tranſport!</hi>—Her <hi>Eyes</hi> ſeem'd to have
<hi>conſpir'd,</hi> againſt the Purpoſe of her <hi>Hands:</hi> For they
ſtream'd down <hi>Tears</hi> upon the <pb n="402" facs="tcp:0199100802:403"/> Paper, as if
they would <hi>efface</hi> the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Words, as faſt as ſhe had written
them. And, now and then, a <hi>Sigh,</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Love alone</hi>
inſpires) ſwell'd her conſcious, and diſtracted, Boſom.</p>
                  <p> AT laſt, ſhe ſaw <hi>me,</hi> and
<hi>trembled!</hi>—She roſe, in Confuſion, and came forward, to
embrace me, which while ſhe was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe preſs'd into my Boſom, the
Paper, ſhe had been writing: And, with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Burſt</hi> of Tears,
breaking ſuddenly from my Neck, flew, down a Pair of Back-Stairs, into the
Garden; and left me Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, with Aſtoniſhment!</p>
                  <p> I FOUND the Paper addreſs'd to <hi>me:</hi> And I leave you
to imagine, whether my <hi>Surprize</hi> was at all abated, when I perus'd in
it, the following Diſcovery of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſs'd <hi>Cauſe</hi> of my dear
Friend's <hi>Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q> 
                     <p> OH! my ever-lov'd!—my faithful Friend!—my Heart is
flowing to you, with <hi>ſuch</hi> Shame, and <hi>confeſſing
Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,</hi> as they who are ſerene enough to enjoy the Comforts of
<hi>Devotion,</hi> addreſs all-pitying <hi>Heaven</hi> with.—My
Miſery is ſo truly great, that nothing but the <hi>Sin</hi> of having
<hi>conceal'd a Thought from you,</hi> cou'd have given it the leaſt
<hi>Addition.</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p> BUT, let me haſten to <hi>impart,</hi> to you, the only
Grief, I cou'd have had a Reaſon for <hi>hiding</hi> from you—I
<hi>love</hi>—Oh! how <pb n="403" facs="tcp:0199100802:404"/> ſhall my Confuſion
preſerve Strength to go on? while I add—That it is—<hi>Your
Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band!</hi>—Let His <hi>Perfection</hi> plead for me, if you
<hi>ſtart</hi> at this Declaration.—And, oh! <hi>confeſs,</hi> what
you have experienc'd, ſo undeniably,—<hi>That none cou'd have ſeen
him, as I have, without being as guilty, as I am.</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p> I WAS dull enough to imagine, That <hi>Friendſhip</hi> having
poſſeſs'd my Heart, wou'd have <hi>guarded</hi> it, againſt
<hi>Love:</hi> But, oh! <hi>That</hi> Thought has <hi>loſt</hi> me!</p> 
                     <p> IT was the fatal Happineſs of being <hi>near you,</hi> that
diſcover'd to me the Beauties of his Mind,—His reſpectful
Tenderneſs, for <hi>You:</hi> His impartial, and diſtinguiſhing Affection
for his <hi>Children!</hi>—His Contempt of the <hi>Proud,</hi> and
<hi>Ignoble</hi>; And his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the <hi>Friendleſs,</hi> and
<hi>Unhappy!</hi>—Oh! how fatally is He accompliſh'd!—and how
<hi>deſerving</hi> your Affection!</p> 
                     <p> CONCEAL from him, oh, my Friend! the Knowledge, that He has
made me <hi>wretched:</hi> For, <hi>yet,</hi> my Eyes, and my Actions have been
ſo watchfully <hi>guarded,</hi> that <hi>He</hi> is as much a Stranger to it,
as all the World, but <hi>Yourſelf</hi>; from whom to have <hi>conceal'd</hi>
it, appear'd to me as <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> as <hi>not</hi> to have conceal'd it
from your Husband.</p> 
                     <p> THIS, only, <hi>dreadful,</hi> Cauſe ſhou'd have torn me
from your lov'd Society.—Suffer me, <hi>here,</hi> to bury myſelf, in
the <hi>Innocence</hi> of <hi>Solitude</hi>; till Abſence, or Death, ſhall 
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0199100802:405"/> have put an End to the Tyranny, with which <hi>Love</hi>
has triumph'd over me.</p> 
                     <p> I KNOW you are too generous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, on this ſad
Occaſion, any dull, or mean, <hi>Excuſes.</hi>—Where the
<hi>Will</hi> is not guilty, the <hi>Misfortune</hi> is ſufficient
<hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But, tho' you have no Pretence for <hi>Pardoning,</hi> I
flatter myſelf, you will <hi>weep for</hi> me; and, in Pity, now and then,
<hi>ſee</hi> your ever faithful, unhappy, Friend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>DESIGNING to be grave to Day, on the ſober Subject of

            <q> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>SALADIN,</hi> the <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> tho' he
had Dominions enough, of his own, was always ready, when Occaſion offered, to
<hi>make free</hi> with other People's.—At his Return without Succeſs,
from the Siege of <hi>Moſoul,</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> he ſeized into his
Hands the whole Lordſhip of <hi>Emeſſa,</hi> in Prejudice to the Right of
<hi>Naſir Eddin,</hi> the young Prince, who clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it. And <hi>this</hi> he
did, upon Pretence, That the late <hi>Father</hi> of the Youth had
<hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,</hi> by giving Countenance to Conſedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies againſt the
<hi>Soldan</hi>'s Intereſt.</p> 
               <p> 
                  <hi>SALADIN,</hi> however, ordered, That proper Care ſhould be
taken, of the injur'd Prince's Education: and being deſirous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, 
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0199100802:425"/> what Progreſs he made in his Studies, he was brought,
one Day, before the <hi>Soldan</hi>; who asked him, with much Gravity, <hi>In
what Part of the Alcoran he was Reading?</hi>—I am come, reply'd the
young Prince (to the <hi>Surprize of all,</hi> who were near him) to that
Verſe, which informs me, That <hi>He</hi> who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> the
<hi>Eſtates</hi> of ORPHANS, is not a <hi>King,</hi> but a
<hi>Tyrant.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> THE <hi>Soldan</hi> was much ſtartled at the Turn, and Spirit,
of his <hi>Repartee</hi>; but, after ſome Pauſe, and Recollection, return'd
the Youth this generous Anſwer.—He, who <hi>ſpeaks,</hi> with ſuch
<hi>Reſolution,</hi> would <hi>act</hi> with ſo much <hi>Courage,</hi> that
I <hi>reſtore</hi> you to your Father's Poſſeſſions, leſt I
ſhould be thought to ſtand in <hi>Fear</hi> of a Virtue, which I only
<hi>reverence.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>SUCH an Influence has <hi>Firmneſs,</hi> even in <hi>Words,</hi>
and <hi>Appearance!</hi> But, when reduced into <hi>Practice,</hi> it is
productive of <hi>innumerable Benefits:</hi> So that, were I to be asked by a
Man of Senſe, <hi>Which would be his ſhorteſt Road, to Felicity</hi>; My
Anſwer ſhould be, The Path, which leads thro' <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and
<hi>Reſolution:</hi> No other <hi>Road,</hi> but this! and no other
<hi>Guide,</hi> than <hi>Conſcience,</hi> can carry him <hi>through</hi> his
Journey, and bring him <hi>ſafe</hi> to the <hi>End</hi> he aims at.</p>
            <p>RESOLUTION in <hi>Life,</hi> is like <hi>Action</hi> in
<hi>Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> deſcribed it: It is the
<hi>Firſt, Second,</hi> and <hi>Third</hi> Thing neceſſary. The Soul is
endowed with Three powerful Faculties; <pb n="425" facs="tcp:0199100802:426"/> the
<hi>Underſtanding,</hi> the <hi>Memory,</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi>; but, with
regard to <hi>moral Life,</hi> they all Three lie <hi>dead,</hi> without the
Help of <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Reſolution is their <hi>Parent,</hi> their
<hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,</hi> and their <hi>Nurſe.</hi> It firſt impregnates them with
<hi>Activity</hi>; then <hi>delivers</hi> them in their <hi>Labours</hi>; and
<hi>nouriſhes</hi> the Effects of thoſe Labours with
<hi>Perſeverance.</hi> What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it, to <hi>know</hi> either the
<hi>Good</hi> or the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> if we <hi>forget</hi> or
<hi>over-look</hi> that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Or, to what End do we <hi>remember,</hi>
what is Great, and Heroick in others, if <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi> does not
conform our Will to co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with our Underſtanding!</p>
            <p>RESOLUTION therefore is the ſpiritual Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mind's
beſt Faculties: and may, not improperly, be called the <hi>Soul</hi> of the
very <hi>Soul</hi> itſelf.—It exerciſes the Underſtanding into
<hi>Meditation</hi>; Meditation gives Life to Memory; and reduces <hi>Good
Will</hi> into Habit; and Habitual Good Will inſpires the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and
Underſtanding to break beautifully forth, into a Series of <hi>good
Actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR this Reaſon I have often reflected, that we ſtand more in
Need of being <hi>remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> than of being <hi>taught</hi>; and that,
whoever would lead Men to be <hi>good,</hi> that is, to be <hi>happy</hi>;
ſhould rather inſpire them with Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to <hi>do</hi> what they know
to be right, than to learn, <hi>what it is</hi> to do rightly. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arguments
ſhould be chiefly applied to the <hi>Memory,</hi> and are <hi>Incentives</hi>
to the <hi>Will,</hi> rather than <hi>Aids</hi> to the
<hi>Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:0199100802:427"/>THIS is evident, methinks, from the
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conſiderations; <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as it regards practical Life,
is no more than a Faculty of diſcerning what is Good, from what is Evil; what
is to be embraced, and what rejected.—Now if the wiſeſt Man upon
Earth, by the Dint only of <hi>Reſolution,</hi> could bring himſelf to
<hi>practiſe,</hi> what a Man of the moſt mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Faculties
<hi>comprehends</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhes,</hi> he would indeed, be a
<hi>wiſe Man,</hi> according to the genuine Signification. But, as the World
goes, were we ſtrictly to meaſure the Capacities, even of the
<hi>Wiſeſt,</hi> by their <hi>Actions,</hi> we ſhould be mortified into a
Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of conſidering this vaſt Globe, but as a Stage full of
<hi>buſy Fools,</hi> with ſcarce a ſteady Purpoſe among them. And,
however the Philoſophers may have declared a <hi>Vacuum</hi> an Abſurdity
in <hi>Nature</hi>; we ſhould, plainly, diſcover one, in <hi>Senſe,</hi>
among the Agents of the intellectual World: We muſt therefore conclude, That
the Fault lies not in the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> but the <hi>Will</hi>; nor
proceeds from Want of Knowledge, but Deficiency of Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and
Reſolution. Mr. DRYDEN, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Men in their <hi>thinking</hi> and
<hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Faculty, ſays ſomewhere, to the Praiſe of the
<hi>meaneſt</hi> Writers, That he never read any Argument ſo
<hi>indifferently</hi> handled, out of which a <hi>wiſe</hi> Man might not
gather ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was <hi>valuable:</hi> And <hi>Cardinal</hi> RICHLIEU,
has obſerv'd, concerning <hi>active</hi> and <hi>political</hi> Life, That he
knew many, to <pb n="427" facs="tcp:0199100802:428"/> whom the Direction of great
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> might be happily committed in the <hi>Morning,</hi> whom,
yet, in the <hi>Afternoon,</hi> he would ſcarce truſt with the
<hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of his <hi>Hen-rooſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A LITTLE common Thief knows he <hi>ſhould not</hi> commit
Injuſtice; and underſtands well enough, when he commits it—but,
wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Reſolution</hi> to be <hi>publickly needy,</hi> rather than
<hi>privately diſhoneſt,</hi> he deviates from the <hi>real</hi> Good; and
ventures upon the <hi>appearing.</hi>—How often has the <hi>Judge</hi>
acted the <hi>Felon</hi> upon the Bench, and robb'd before <hi>their</hi>
Faces, who <hi>accuſe Robbers</hi> at his Tribunal! He <hi>dares commit</hi>
the very Crime which he is ſeated there, to condemn; But he wants
<hi>Reſolution</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Bribe, though he has not the Felon's
<hi>Neceſſity</hi> to plead in Excuſe of it: The poor Thief in this
Caſe, as <hi>ſilly</hi> as he looks at the <hi>Bar,</hi> ſtands in Need
of no <hi>Inſtructor.</hi> But the Judge himſelf, as <hi>wiſe</hi> as he
appears, in his <hi>Furs,</hi> wants a <hi>Remembrancer</hi> at his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, to
put him in Mind of his Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>COMMON Gameſters,</hi> know ſo well the Ignominy of giving
<hi>falſe Judgment,</hi> at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Hazard-Table,</hi> that they have
generally <hi>Reſolution</hi> enough to reſiſt very great ſecret
Temptations that Way; and have ſeldom been found guilty, though
<hi>Cuſtom,</hi> and not <hi>Conſcience,</hi> is the Motive of their
Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But, how <hi>little Hiſtory</hi> need we read, to know, That we
have had Diſpenſers of Equity, who have been in the utmoſt
<hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> of Plain-dealing <hi>Monitors,</hi> not indeed to 
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0199100802:429"/> 
               <hi>inſtruct</hi> them; but to put them in
<hi>Mind,</hi> that <hi>Equity was not Iniquity.</hi>—We <hi>all</hi> of
us <hi>know,</hi> but <hi>few,</hi> or <hi>none</hi> of us
<hi>think.</hi>—We diſtinguiſh not the Things that lie
<hi>before</hi> us, through the <hi>Miſtineſs</hi> of <hi>Avarice,</hi> or
any other intervening Paſſion. It cannot be ſaid, that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to
<hi>ſee:</hi> But that we <hi>ſee</hi> without
<hi>Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>—The <hi>Underſtanding</hi> has <hi>Eyes,</hi>
but <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolution</hi> has <hi>jaundic'd</hi> them.</p>
            <p>HOW does <hi>Ambition</hi> reduce and miſlead thoſe, whom we
call <hi>wiſe</hi> Men, into auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Condeſcenſions, which make them
cheap in the very Eyes of the <hi>Vulgar?</hi> How often have we ſeen
<hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Inſolence</hi> aſſume the Flexure of the
<hi>ſneaking Candidate,</hi> in order to <hi>ſtrut</hi> immediately after,
in the Abuſe of intruſted <hi>Office?</hi> The <hi>Farce of</hi> DOCTOR
FAUSTUS has been repreſented as <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>ridiculous,</hi>
becauſe, its <hi>Plot</hi> is <hi>no more,</hi> than that, while the
<hi>Conjurer</hi> enjoys his <hi>Wand,</hi> he enjoys his Wiſhes: <hi>That
Wand</hi> converts every Thing into the Accompliſhment of his Purpoſes: But
no ſooner is his <hi>Term,</hi> of holding that <hi>White Staff,
expired;</hi> than the <hi>Conjuration expires</hi> with it; and he is the
pooreſt, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, moſt deſpairing, and moſt abandon'd Wretch alive.
This, every Spectator ſees <hi>through,</hi> and <hi>laughs</hi> at; and yet,
how happy might it have been for ſome other <hi>Wand-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> of this
Kingdom, if that poor <hi>Farce</hi> had been acted before them, inſtead of
<hi>their</hi> duller <hi>State Interludes,</hi> in order to ſerve as a
uſeful <hi>Memorial,</hi> that they ſhould not miſuſe 
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0199100802:430"/> 
               <hi>thoſe Wands</hi> like FAUSTUS; that is, play
Tricks, till their <hi>Time is out,</hi> and then be <hi>delivered up</hi> to
the <hi>Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS <hi>little</hi> Men become <hi>great</hi> by
<hi>Reſolution,</hi> and <hi>great Men</hi> degenerate into <hi>little</hi>
ones with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; ſo <hi>Admonitions,</hi> to thoſe Duties, which every
<hi>little Man</hi> knows, are <hi>neceſſary</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to
the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi>; Of this ALEXANDER's Father, PHILIP, demonſtrated
himſelf very ſenſible; That Prince's <hi>Servant, knew,</hi> no doubt, as
well as his <hi>Maſter,</hi> that a <hi>King</hi> was no more than a
<hi>Man:</hi> But PHILIP, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that high Fortune had often made <hi>light
Heads forget</hi> themſelves, commanded this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to wake him every
Morning, by this well-known Leſſon in his Ear;—<hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou art
but a Man.</hi>—Now, many would be apt to imagine, that little Profit
could ariſe from ſuch conſtant Repetition of this ſhort and needleſs
Intimation: Yet Sir FRANCIS BACON, who <hi>knew</hi> well both the
<hi>great</hi> World and the <hi>little,</hi> has left us the following
<hi>Axiom</hi> concerning it: 
<q rend="inline">"All (<hi>moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial</hi>) Precepts concerning
<hi>Kings,</hi> are, in Effect, comprehended in theſe Two
<hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances;—Remember thou art a Man;—Remember thou art</hi>
GOD<hi>'s Vicegerent.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> bridleth their <hi>Power,</hi> the
other their <hi>Will.</hi>"</q>—In Truth, if ALEXANDER had affected to be
no more than he was, the Son of PHILIP, inſtead of aſpiring to Divinity and
the Title of AMMON; he would have <hi>more</hi> than conquer'd the World; for
he would have conquered the very Conqueror of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:0199100802:431"/>RESOLUTION then, is the only Means to make a
Man compleatly <hi>happy</hi>; and frequent <hi>Admonition</hi> ſerves to
keep <hi>Reſolution</hi> alive. The <hi>Loweſt</hi> can ſcarce ſtand in
Need of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Inſtruction</hi>; but the <hi>Higheſt</hi> may be
greatly indebted for <hi>Admonition</hi>; and conſequently, all young Men,
who propoſe to make any Figure in publick Employments, ſhould give Ear, to
a <hi>Plain Dealer,</hi> who dares put them in Mind of their
Weakneſs.—A Man who has Firmneſs enough to <hi>ſee</hi> the
<hi>Worſt</hi> of his own Soul, will ſoon have the Satisfaction to find the
Proſpect much <hi>better'd.</hi> He will learn Patience in <hi>ill</hi>
Fortune, and Abſtinence in <hi>good</hi>; He will be fortified with
<hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to be <hi>humble, juſt,</hi> and <hi>charitable,</hi>
amidſt the ſtrongeſt <hi>Inflations,</hi> and Indulgements of
<hi>Proſperity:</hi> and diſdain to be found <hi>envious, dejected,</hi> or
<hi>revengeful,</hi> amidſt the <hi>bittereſt</hi> Reſentments, and
Sollicitations of <hi>Calamity.</hi> Such a Man ſhall not only preſerve an
inward Tranquility; but, whatever the Colour of his Fortune may be, he will owe
a Luſtre to <hi>Himſelf,</hi> and caſt it round him upon <hi>Others.</hi>
He will not only be <hi>followed,</hi> but <hi>beloved</hi> in his

                  <p> IT is with no ſmall Expectation, that I obſerve you, in
ſome of your Papers, making Excurſions into the Province of
<hi>Criticiſm:</hi> It is a Subject, not only <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,</hi> but
<hi>Inſtructive:</hi> And there is no kind of Knowledge, in which thoſe gay
Spirits, who are loudeſt, and moſt ready, in giving Judgment, are ſo
contemptibly and lamentably Deficient, as in the Art of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rightly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> TWO Improvements might be hop'd for, in the Taſte of moſt
Readers, from a more general Propagation of the Knowledge of
<hi>diſtinguiſhing clearly:</hi> We ſhould neither be aſhamed to
praiſe the Merit of the Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt <pb n="432" facs="tcp:0199100802:433"/> reſt of our

                     <hi>HOMER</hi>'s famous Catalogue, of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Ships,
and their Commanders, would, then, I am apt to believe, ceaſe to paſs for
one of his Sublimeſt, and moſt Poetical Beauties. Its Geographieal
Exactneſs would no longer be pleaded as a Ballance, againſt the Dryneſs,
and Tediouſneſs, of its Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Enumeration: Since it is no Part of a
<hi>Poet's</hi> Buſineſs, to teach the Situation, Bounds, and Quality, of
Countries. Little, occaſional Deſcriptions of that kind, 'tis true, may
ſometimes, be neceſſary; and, being artfully introduced, and handled,
might not only <hi>diverſify</hi> a Poem; but alſo render it
<hi>delightful:</hi> Without which laſt Quality, the whole Labour is loſt.
And nothing, certainly, can <hi>delight,</hi> that is <hi>tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,</hi> and
<hi>heavy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> BUT the Bigotry of a Succeſſion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poetical

                  <p> MANY a Lady has been charm'd into a Paſſion for her future
Lover, upon Sight only of his <hi>Picture:</hi> But my Fate is the very
Reverſe of This; For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaw the <hi>Picture</hi> of my
<hi>Florello,</hi> I was almoſt in Love with the <hi>Original:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
now, I am fallen abſolutely in Love with the Picture, and can ſcarce bear
the Sight of That odious Lover of mine, who <hi>ſat</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p> THE Picture, you muſt know, is a Kind of Paradox: For it is
drawn but in <hi>Black,</hi> and <hi>White</hi>; and yet glows, with the
live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Force; and moſt natural Mixture of ſtrong <hi>Colouring!</hi>
It is <hi>One,</hi> of a valuable <hi>Collection,</hi> which was expos'd to
Publick Sale laſt Week; under Title of <hi>The</hi> UNIVERSAL 
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0199100802:440"/> PASSION, <hi>Part</hi> II.—Wou'd to Heaven I knew
the Painter! A Hand, ſo exquiſite at <hi>Touching,</hi> ſhould <hi>take
me,</hi> as often as I cou'd poſſibly ſit to him. Nay, I wou'd ſooner
be drawn by <hi>Him,</hi> than by <hi>Apelles,</hi> or <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> or
<hi>Lilly,</hi> or <hi>Vandike</hi>; or by any Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ancient, or modern;

                  </p>
                  <p> NOT but there is infinite Difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Two Pieces;
and the <hi>Lines,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are ſtrikingly diſtinguiſh'd, in

de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate!</hi> In my <hi>Florello</hi>'s, They are <hi>ſtrong, bold,
glaring! Florello</hi>'s very <hi>Life</hi> is not half ſo <hi>lively,</hi>

                  <p> YOU will much oblige one of your conſtant Readers, and very

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p> I HAVE perceived, quite through the Courſe of your Papers,
that your Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, is not only to <hi>Delight</hi> your Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but to
<hi>Inform,</hi> and <hi>Refine</hi> them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Conſideration, I muſt
perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, you will ſet the following Subject in the ſtrongeſt
Light; which, the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to recommend it to you, I aſſure you it
is not fictitious, but real Matter of Fact.—There is a certain Widow, who
has two Sons, and two Daughters, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of which, are arrived to the
State, which writes them <hi>Men,</hi> both brought up to creditable
Employments; but neither of them capable of proceeding in their Buſineſs,
without her Aſſiſtance; which, tho' very able to give, ſhe
<hi>refuſes</hi> them.</p>
                  <p> YOU will be more than a little ſurprized, when I tell you,
there is a Perſon, beyond Deſcription, ruſtical, and unlovely, who 
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:0199100802:445"/> makes his aukward Addreſſes to the <hi>Wealth</hi>
of this Widow: And that this is the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> which ſhe
prefers to the Welfare of her Children, who have urg'd her, on their Knees, to
regard, not only <hi>Their Good,</hi> but what the World will ſay of
<hi>herſelf.</hi>—Deaf to all their Interceſſions, ſhe
continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repulſes them, and is unalterably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, on her
<hi>own</hi> and <hi>their</hi> Ruin.</p>
                  <p> NOW, I would beg of you, to tell me, What Motive can induce her
to this? And to account for it in a <hi>Phyſical</hi> Manner? Should not the
moving Wants and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of her own Children, prevail more upon her
<hi>Nature,</hi> than the intereſted Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of a <hi>Stranger</hi>?
For I am afraid, there are no Incentives to <hi>Love,</hi> on either Side, and
I am loth to give it its <hi>other Name.</hi> If, Sir, you inſert this as
ſoon as you can in your Paper, you may do a real Good, and at the ſame Time
you will oblige one of your conſtanr Readers.</p>

            <p>MY good Friend, <hi>Tony Jyngle,</hi> whom I have not ſeen till
lately, ſince the Death of Sir <hi>Portly Rufus,</hi> of which I gave my
Readers the melancholy Hiſtory, in one of my former Papers; was juſt come
to viſit me, as I had received this Letter, from the Publiſher: And, upon
hearing it read, told me, with much Force of Politeneſs, and Penetration, 
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:0199100802:446"/> That there were <hi>certain Politick Reaſons,</hi>

it might do as as well, if I accounted for it <hi>Poetically:</hi> And, to that

                  <p> THE aſtoniſhing Structure, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, but beautiful,

but, the <hi>Veneration</hi> of every reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Being. No leſs than
<hi>infinite Wiſdom</hi> could conceive the Plan; nor leſs than
<hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power</hi> erect the Fabrick! Our Sight is ſtruck with
Amazement, when we look but upon a ſtately Building, the mere Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of
Human Invention; And, yet, (to the Shame of our Stupidity be it ſpoken) we
can conſider the <hi>Earth,</hi> we live on, with
<hi>Indifference</hi>;—we can walk under the <hi>Lamps</hi> of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> without being inlightened by the ſmalleſt Glimmering of
Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection! nor (to many) do they argue any <pb n="447" facs="tcp:0199100802:448"/>
thing greater than <hi>Chance,</hi> which, in other Words, is
<hi>Nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> YET, certainly, no Knowledge can be ſo <hi>delightful,</hi>
to the Soul, as <hi>This,</hi> which is, at the ſame Time, the
<hi>nobleſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>uſeful,</hi> that can buſy us, in our
ſhort Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage through the <hi>Body.</hi> Nay, The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mr.

                  <p> I AM ſenſible, You concur with me, that the <hi>Honour</hi>
due to <hi>God,</hi> ſhould excite the nobleſt of our Thoughts, and

Regions of <hi>Matter,</hi> about us, in which there is not the leaſt
Particle, but carries with it an Argument of God's Exiſtence; not the
ſmalleſt Trifle but ſhews it; nor the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Motion produced, the
ſofteſt Whiſper of the Air, but tells it.—The Frame and
Conſtitution of the World, the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Magnificence of it, the

               <p> IN order to prove, to any Doubter, the the Grandeur of this
Fabrick, we need only bid him conſider the <hi>Sun,</hi> with that
inſupportable Glory that ſurrounds it: The vaſt Diſtance, Magnitude,
and Heat of it! The Planets periodically moving in their ſeveral Orbits,
about it, with all their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Variety</hi> of Aſpects, guarded,
ſome of them, by <hi>ſecondary Planets,</hi> and, as it were,
<hi>emulating</hi> the State of the <hi>Sun</hi>; and, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, all Theſe,
poſſeſs'd by diſtinct and proper <hi>Inhabitants!</hi>—Let him
think of thoſe ſurprizing Viſits the <hi>Comets</hi> make us; the large
Trains of uncommon Splendor, which attend them; the <hi>far Country</hi> they 
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:0199100802:450"/> come from, and the Curioſity and Horror they excite,
not only among <hi>us,</hi> but in the Inhabitants of the Worlds about us; who
alſo may be <hi>up,</hi> as we are, to ſee the <hi>Entry,</hi> and
<hi>Progreſs,</hi> of theſe new Miniſters of the Almighty:—Let him
direct his Eye and Contemplation, through thoſe azure Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons above him, up
to the <hi>fixed Stars,</hi> that radiant, and numberleſs <hi>Hoſt</hi> of
<hi>Heaven</hi>; and reflect but, how unlikely it is, that they ſhould be
placed there, only to adorn, and beſpangle, our Canopy! He will, then,
inſtruct himſelf, that they are ſo many <hi>other</hi> SUNS, with their
ſeveral Regions, and and dependant Planets, about them! He will further
diſcern, by the Help of Glaſſes, ſtill more and more of theſe
<hi>fixed Lights,</hi> and exalt himſelf to an Apprehenſion of their
unaccountable Numbers, and of the Immenſity of thoſe Spaces, that lie
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired beyond, not our <hi>Ken</hi> only, but even our
<hi>Imagination.</hi>

we examine <hi>This our Earth,</hi> what Scope is here for
Admiration?—What Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mountains, Hills, Valleys, Plains, Rivers,
Seas, Trees, Plants! What num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Tribes of different Animals is it
ſtock'd with! How unwearied are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and Works of <hi>one</hi> of
theſe; which is MAN! And yet, when they are <pb n="447" facs="tcp:0199100802:454"/> all
ſurvey'd, as nicely as they can be, whether by our unaſſiſted Senſes,
or the Help of <hi>Teleſcopical</hi> Glaſſes; the Aſſiſtance of
<hi>Microſcopes,</hi> in the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> Parts of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
will go on to diſcover as many new Wonders, as thoſe which have already
been made known to us. New Kingdoms of Animals; new Architecture, and
Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of Workmanſhip, and Oeconomy. So that as, <hi>before,</hi> our
Conception fainted, in thoſe boundleſs Journeys we were obliged to take
through the expanſive Vaſtneſs of the Univerſe; here, on the other
Hand, we tire ourſelves with fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Reſearches into the Principles
and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Parts of it. Both the <hi>Beginnings</hi> and the
<hi>End</hi> of Things, the <hi>Leaſt</hi> and the <hi>Greateſt,</hi> all
conſpire to perplex us: And which every way we proſecute our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, we
ſtill fall in with freſh Subjects of Amazement, and freſh Reaſons to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there are more and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that will for ever eſcape our
eagereſt and moſt ſucceſsful Penetration. We have
<hi>Philoſophy,</hi> indeed, but, the Misfortune is, it dwells but in the
<hi>Surface</hi> of Nature.—</p> 
               <p> IT appears, then, plainly enough, in the Parts and Model of the
World, that there is a <hi>Contrivance,</hi> and a Reſpect to certain
<hi>Reaſons,</hi> and <hi>Ends.</hi> Why elſe is the Sun poſited near the
Middle of our <hi>Syſtem</hi>; but for the more convenient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing of
his Influence to the Planets, <pb n="448" facs="tcp:0199100802:455"/> moving about him? Why
elſe does the Plan of the Earth's <hi>Aequator,</hi> interſect that of her
<hi>Orbit,</hi> and make a proper <hi>Angle</hi> with it, but in order to
diverſify the Year, and create a uſeful <hi>Variety</hi> of
<hi>Seaſons.</hi> Many other Things of this kind, tho' a thouſand Times
repeated, will be always delightful Obſervations to good Men and true
Scholars: None of whom can obſerve thoſe Vapours which aſcend from the
Sea, to meet in <hi>Clouds</hi> above, and fall back again, after
<hi>Condenſation,</hi> without underſtanding the Purpoſe of this
providential <hi>Diſtillation</hi> to be a Diviſion of the Water from its
groſſer <hi>Salts,</hi> that, by Rains, and Dews, it may return upon and
ſupply the Fountains, and refreſhing Rivers, nouriſhing the Vegetables by
Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which therefore deſcend not in Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts, but kindly Drops, as
from a Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, upon a Garden!</p> 
               <p> WHO can view the Structure of a <hi>Plant</hi> or an
<hi>Animal</hi>; the indefinite Number of their <hi>Fibres,</hi> and fine
<hi>Veſſels,</hi> their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon <hi>larger,</hi> and the ſeveral
Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon <hi>them,</hi> and the apt Diſpoſition of all theſe; the
Proviſion that is made for Reception and Diſtribution of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Effect of this Nouriſhment, in Extenſion of the Veſſels,
ſtretching the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,</hi> or <hi>Animal,</hi> gradually, to its
full and determinate Growth; maintaining the Motion of the ſeveral
<hi>Fluids,</hi> repairing the <pb n="449" facs="tcp:0199100802:456"/> Decays of the Body; and
comforting and preſerving Life? Who can take Notice of the various
<hi>Faculties</hi> of Animals, their Arts of ſaving, and providing for
themſelves, or the Means by which they are provided for; the Uſes of
<hi>Plants</hi> to Animals, and of ſome Animals to <hi>others,</hi> and of
the Generality of them to <hi>Mankind</hi>; the Propagation of the ſeveral
Species out of their <hi>proper</hi> Seeds (without Confuſion!) the ſtrong
Inclinations implanted for that Purpoſe; and the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, even of the
Fierceſt to their <hi>Young:</hi> Who, I ſay, can view all this, and not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a <hi>Deſign,</hi> and an <hi>omnipotent Deſigner?</hi> The
meaneſt Inſect, which ſcarce appears, at all, to our naked Eye, will,
when viewed through a Microſcope, preſent a Proſpect, a Thouſand Times
more curious, and ſurprizing, than the fineſt Piece of
<hi>Mechaniſm,</hi> that ever was made by <hi>Man!</hi> For my own Part, as I
cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that I am <hi>fearfully,</hi> and <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
formed;</hi> I likewiſe believe, as firmly, that ſome ſuperintendent Hand
hath <hi>conducted</hi> and <hi>protected me,</hi> from my Birth, to this
preſent Moment; or that, in the Words of the moſt Sacred of all
<hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.—There is a God, in whom I live, move, and have my
Being.</hi>
               </p> 
               <p> WHO, then, that judges of this God, by his <hi>Works</hi> and
his <hi>Mercy,</hi> will be afraid of that <hi>Death,</hi> which muſt bring
us one Stage <hi>nearer</hi> him? Nay, who knows, but <pb n="450" facs="tcp:0199100802:457"/>
that what we <hi>call</hi> DEATH, may be our real, and proper, LIFE, and this,
which we think our <hi>Life,</hi> a kind of <hi>dark,</hi> and <hi>dreaming,
Interval,</hi> which Death only comes to <hi>awaken,</hi> and <hi>redeem</hi>
us from? For my Part, I look forward on the Hour of my
<hi>Diſſolution,</hi> with the Hope, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, of eſcaping
<hi>Mariners,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſinking all Night long, in a

            <p>I AM, though a great Lover of <hi>Trade,</hi> a declar'd Enemy to
the Company of <hi>Vintners</hi>; and profeſs, That my Indignation daily
riſes againſt them more and more, in proportion as they daily deviate from
their firſt laudable Inſtitution. Taverns were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, at their
primitive Erection, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Refectories,</hi> where Men, whoſe
Buſineſs called them Abroad from their Families, and ſingle Gentlemen,
who had no Familes at all, might reſort for a chearful and neceſſary
Refreſhment. So that <hi>Taverns</hi> ſtood in this Town for much the
ſame End, as <hi>Inns</hi> are commodiouſly ſituated up and down the
Country: But, by the Uſe they are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to, Men are not
<hi>refreſh'd</hi> there, but <hi>debauch'd,</hi> and taken off from the
Purſuit of their Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="453" facs="tcp:0199100802:460"/>I WAS led into this Subject, on the Eve of a
late drunken Holiday, when, returning Home in a melancholy Diſpoſition, at
a later Hour than uſual, I was unexpectedly ſaluted with an unlucky Piece
of News, that a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, notwithſtanding all that a famous
Predeceſſor of mine had wittily remark'd, in Ridicule of that ſilly
Practice, wou'd try to drive to himſelf Home on the <hi>Coach-box</hi>; when
he was ſcarce able to get into the <hi>Coach,</hi> without the Help of its
<hi>proper Driver</hi>; had, by the Way, got ſo dangerous a Fall, that he was
thrown almoſt out of the World: And juſt as I was plung'd into a profound
Meditation on this ill Accident, Word was brought me, That <hi>Literatus</hi>
and <hi>Urbanus,</hi> two Boſom Intimates, having drank toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to
Exceſs, the latter loſt his <hi>Civility,</hi> and the former his
<hi>Wits,</hi> ſo far as to puſh on a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about a mere Trifle, 'till
one of them was killed, and his <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Murderer,</hi> left
behind, to imbitter his ſurviving Days with a <hi>Remorſe,</hi> which the
other's <hi>Death</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable to.—I was loſt in the
ſtartling Thought, how dreadful it muſt be, to drop out of a
<hi>Temporary</hi> into an <hi>Eternal</hi> Exiſtence, in ſo deplorable,
and unprepar'd a State! which brought immediately to my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, what the
old King ſays to <hi>Hamlet</hi> in the Tragedy.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:0199100802:461"/> 
               <l>Thus was I—</l> 
               <l>Cut off, ev'n in the <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> of my Sin,</l> 
               <l>No <hi>Reck'ning</hi> made, but ſent to my
<hi>Account,</hi>
               </l> 
               <l>With all my Imperfections on my Head.</l>

            </q>
            <p>THIS ſenſible and moving Complaint, ſo awfully placed in the
Mouth of a <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> ſtrikes a conſiderate Auditor with Terror, and
leaves him <hi>warn'd</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſh'd:</hi> But, there is a Scene
in a Comedy, call'd <hi>The Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lovers,</hi> That comes more immediately to
this Subject, of a Gentleman's Stabbing his Friend in the Fury of his
Drunkenneſs; and which, if it had been read or heard with At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, by
<hi>Urbanus,</hi> would probably have prevented his own becoming a too real
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>this unhappy Truth,</hi> That a Man, who in the preſent
Moment, is Maſter of the ſtrongeſt Reaſon, Poſſeſſor of the
greateſt Honour, and adorn'd with the fineſt Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion,
Friendſhip and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may, in two or three Hours <hi>drinking,</hi> be
puſh'd forward, by the Rage of Wine, to act unheard-of <hi>Brutalities,</hi>
in direct Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Impulſe of all its Virtues. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this
uſeful Scene to the Peruſal of thoſe indanger'd Adventurers, who are apt
to be quarrelſome in their Cups, and yet dare raſhly addict themſelves to
an habitual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:0199100802:462"/>THE Fatigue of ſo melancholy a
Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, caſt me into a diſorder'd kind of Sleep, in which it
furniſhed me (as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ſays) with <hi>the Stuff of which
Dreams are made.</hi> My Imagination, working buſily upon the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my
waking Thoughts, brought me into the Company of a Hoary and Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matron,
whoſe Eyes were ſo <hi>piercing bright,</hi> that they ſeem'd to have
increas'd by Age, their Faculty of Penetration. She told me, That her Name was
CAUTION, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me follow her, ſhe conducted me, as the Propheteſs
did <hi>Aeneas,</hi> into one of the Regions of the <hi>nether World,</hi>
where the Shades of all thoſe, who depart this Life, in the Guilt of their
Debauches, are doom'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit.</p>
            <p>I FOUND my ſelf, without being able to deſcribe the Method of
my ſpeedy Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thither, in a vaſt Place like an Iſland,
incompaſs'd with a Moat of Liquid Fire, where different Crowds of People,
were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Torment of being <hi>forced</hi> to <hi>drink,</hi> every
Moment, till they were deprived of their Senſes, and betrayed into
Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which never failed to fill their Hearts with Pain and
Remorſe, for ſome enormous Tranſgreſſion or other, committed by them
when ſo diſorder'd.—Then the Fury that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter'd the Liquor,
had a Power of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them, by repreſenting their paſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in a
Glaſs, that ſerv'd them inſtead of <hi>Memory.</hi>—When they had
ſuffer'd the full <pb n="456" facs="tcp:0199100802:463"/> Pangs of Sobriety, and pain'd their
Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with what they <hi>might</hi> have been, and what they
<hi>were</hi>; the Fury drench'd them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, with the Intoxicating Tide of
Torture; and this was the Repetition of a Life, whoſe Circle compos'd a Round
of Miſery, that never was to know an End. Each Crowd was thus attended, by
ſome Deputy of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Vengeance,</p>
            <p>THE firſt, I took Notice of, was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Gentlemen, who,
before they began to drink, were of robuſt Make of Body; they had Sanguine
Complexions, and carried <hi>Health</hi> in their whole Appearance: Before
theſe, a <hi>Devil,</hi> in the Dreſs of a <hi>Drawer,</hi> had placed a
vaſt Barrel of Liquor, of which when each had got his Doſe, the Effects of
the Poiſon began to work differently upon theſe poor Patients, that
ſeem'd lately in a State ſo florid. Some, that were of the moſt gigantick
Size, like <hi>Father Dominick</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh Fryer,</hi> ſunk two
Yards and a Half in the <hi>Wetting.</hi> Others again, who were <hi>thin</hi>
Men, were bloated by Dropſies, into the Dimenſions which the former had
ſhrunk from.—They, who juſt before, had Vigour enough to out-voice
their own Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Horns, were, by a Doſe or two of that ſtrange,
alterative Liquor, brought to <hi>ſqueak</hi> like thoſe <hi>Pipes,</hi>
which the <hi>Boys</hi> make of an <hi>Oat-ſtraw.</hi>—They, who uſed
to leap Five-bar-Gates, Quickſet-Hedges, and Park-Palings, could not wag a
Hand, or a Foot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb n="457" facs="tcp:0199100802:464"/> crying out of the Gout, or the
Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: Theſe had been called in the World, COUNTRY 'SQUIRES, and were
active Men in their Time, at the Hunting down of a <hi>Fox,</hi> or crying up
of a <hi>Burgeſs.</hi>—But it was diſmal to behold, what Faces they
made now, when the Fury ſhew'd them their own Figures, in the ſtartling
Glaſs of Reflection!</p>
            <p>THE next Place, that old Mother CAUTION conducted me to, was a
gloomy Walk, which the farther we penetrated into it, was the deeper darkened
with the Shade of <hi>Juniper</hi> and <hi>Eugh</hi> Trees: In the midſt, was
a Little Thatch'd Houſe, as full as it could hold, of Earthen Veſſels,
ſtor'd with a <hi>Juice,</hi> that was but one Remove from <hi>Poyſon:</hi>
The poor Wretches, who frequented this dark Hovel, where moſtly
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and pleaded the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilege of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> for
getting rid of their Senſes, as <hi>freely,</hi> as their Countrymen, of
higher Quality, who paid <hi>dearer</hi> for the ſame <hi>Right,</hi> in
proportion to their better Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and dealt in Poyſons of a
ſlower Operation. Many Cuſtomers went in here but half Dreſs'd, and came
out again Naked; Moſt of them labour'd under Miſeries and Diſeaſes
without a Name; and ſome of them endeavour'd to hang themſelves on the
Trees that gave a Name to the fatal Liquor.—</p>
            <p>BUT, I was <hi>tranſported</hi> in the next Place I came to, and
flatter'd my Imagination, that I was got out of the infernal Regions, into
thoſe, which were form'd for Delight, and, <pb n="458" facs="tcp:0199100802:465"/> by the
Ancients, called, The <hi>Elyſian Fields.</hi> I was led into a noble
Edifice, adorn'd with the moſt magnificent Furniture, Gildings, Sculptures,
Paintings, Glaſs-Sconces, with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Wax Tapers lighted in them; the
Roofs ecchoed and re-ſounded, with the fineſt Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, that cou'd ariſe
from the moſt elegant Variety of the ſweeteſt Inſtruments. Here was an
Aſſembly of the moſt active and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd Gentlemen, together with a
Set of the moſt ſeemingly modeſt and beautiful Women, that ever my Eyes
beheld;—when, immediately, two <hi>Devils,</hi> in <hi>Maſquerade,
appear'd</hi> to the Company, with the moſt complaiſant and inviting Airs
imaginable.—One of them led the Gentlemen to a luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Table, adorn'd
with Cryſtals, repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſtrongeſt and richeſt Wines, of
all Growths and Climates, and dealt Glaſſes round with Profuſion: The
other, which was a <hi>She Devil,</hi> conducted the Ladies, in like Manner, to
another Table, richly ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Silver Equipages, and Vaſes of the
fineſt <hi>China,</hi> which were filled, as ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, with Liquors,
that promoted <hi>Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> but had really ſo different an Effect, that
the Fumes and Vapours ariſing from their <hi>Brimmers,</hi> forced me to
remove to a greater Diſtance.</p>
            <p>This <hi>drinking</hi> Scene being finiſhed, the Word was given
to <hi>Mask</hi> and <hi>Dance</hi>;—But, inſtead of forming a regular
Motion, the whole Company, Male and Female, without <pb n="459" facs="tcp:0199100802:466"/>
Diſtinction of Sex, Age or Condition, fell, jumbled, into one promiſcuous
Heap, upon which enſued horrid Outcries, and a confus'd Claſh of Swords,
from Men, who were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering one another, about Daughters, Wives and
Siſters: So that in a Moment, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, like the ſhifting of a Scene in
Dr. <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> this fine Apartment was chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an
<hi>Hoſpital,</hi> diſtinguiſh'd into little Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, like
Cells.—In theſe unhappy little Cells, were Ladies under a Courſe of
Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (a Fury always holding before their Eyes, a Picture of their departed
Beauty:) I took Notice of <hi>One,</hi> whoſe Picture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the
ſmootheſt, Satten Skin, with the fineſt Tincture imaginable, while the
blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering Original was melting away in Tears, with Cheeks ſwell'd into
Carbuncles, and ſpotted over with purple Pimples: Another, whoſe Portrait
diſplay'd a Lovelineſs, almoſt Angelical, was ſtaring on it with
bloodſhot Eyes, and a Face, ſo diſtorted with Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that ſhe
look'd, methought, more frightful than the <hi>Fury,</hi> that attended
her.—I begg'd of CAUTION to let me retreat from this melancholy
Manſion, becauſe it fill'd me with more Horror than I was able to
ſupport, to ſee the Effects of ſuch ſeeming Pleaſantry, producing
Deſpair and real Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; and ſuch alluring Beauty, betray'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch
hideous and frightful Deformity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:0199100802:467"/>CAUTION was ſo obliging, as to grant my

when I return'd to the upper Regions, ſhe was under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of
conducting me to ſeveral other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This made it impoſſible for me to
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten out of my Dream, and will not, I hope, expoſe me to the Cenſure,
which we old Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſometimes lie under, of being <hi>tedious</hi> in our
<hi>Story-telling,</hi> and talking rather by <hi>Rule</hi> than by

            <head>The <hi>VISION</hi> continued.</head>
            <p>I WAS as much deceiv'd in the next Place, that Old Mother CAUTION
convey'd me to, as I had been in the laſt.—A mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
<hi>Square</hi> open'd to my View, whoſe <pb n="461" facs="tcp:0199100802:468"/> four Sides
were form'd by the fineſt Architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thoſe Stately Palaces, my Guide
told me, were inhabited by Perſons of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rank and Fortune, and
who were reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to have the moſt <hi>delicate</hi> Taſte of
<hi>Living.</hi> She carry'd me into one, that appear'd the nobleſt in the
Quadrangle; and, there, from a Window towards the Garden, which is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
on an Eminence, that borders on deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Fields, and commands an opening
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Country, ſhe ſhew'd me, by the Help of a Proſpective Glaſs,
a Dozen fair <hi>Manor-Towns,</hi> all ſurrounded by a pleaſant Variety of
Hills and Dales, Plains and Woods, Green Meadows and Corn Fields, richly waving
with a promis'd Harveſt: Gardens, and ſweet <hi>Parterres,</hi> with Fiſh
Ponds and Canals that glitter'd thro' the Trees; All which, ſhe ſaid, was
but a ſmall Portion of the Earth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd by this Son of Fortune, who was
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of that fine Palace we ſtood in—This Houſe had been, it
ſeems, every Day, in the Afternoon, and every Night, and all the Night long,
crowded from Top to Bottom, with People of all Sexes, Ages, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
who, provided they had the Merit of <hi>wanting nothing,</hi> were welcome to
partake of all the Abundance of this Place; where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appear'd, but what
was noble and delightful. The Earth, from Pole to Pole, was ranſack'd (as
were the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Water</hi>) to ſupply this Houſe with
Delicacies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="462" facs="tcp:0199100802:469"/>BUT the Owner (who gloried in his
Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, without eſteeming any one of his Gueſts, but in proportion
as he profeſs'd an Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Oſtentatious Magnificence of Living)
valued himſelf moſt upon the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of his taſteful <hi>Wines,</hi>
which Merchants, from all Quarters of the World, were Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emptying in upon
him. They were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by ſuch different Names, that it would
require as much <hi>Study,</hi> as would make a <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> in any other
Science, to Regiſter, and do Juſtice to their <hi>Titles, Colours,
Taſtes,</hi> and the happy Places which produc'd them. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Companies
in every Apartment, had their <hi>Signals,</hi> and <hi>gave Fire</hi>
together; and, by their Number, it was reckon'd, That every <hi>leading
Glaſs,</hi> that was turn'd up by the gay <hi>Maſter,</hi> pour'd out about
a <hi>Tun,</hi> includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Servants Computations, by way of
<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,</hi> and <hi>Emolument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CAUTION, at the <hi>Sound</hi> of every <hi>Health,</hi> bid me
view the Manors from the Garden Window; and I perceiv'd a Man in a Black Gown,
preſenting a Roll of Parchment to another, who was a Jolly kind of Fellow,
and <hi>Steward,</hi> it ſeems, to the Landlord, arm'd with a <hi>Letter</hi>
of <hi>Attorney,</hi> to ſign what Deeds he ſhould <hi>find
neceſſary.</hi>—No ſooner was this Parchment return'd to the Man in
Black, but immediately the Proſpect ſhorten'd, by the Length of one whole
Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, which, vaniſhing from our Sight, left us no other Land Mark, where
it ſtood, but <pb n="463" facs="tcp:0199100802:470"/> a vaſt and fruitful <hi>Crab
Tree.</hi>—The Healths went round ſo frequently, and ſo merrily, that
the Villages and Manor-Towns, diſappear'd like Miſts, in a Sunny Morning;
till at laſt, the Gentleman in Black, with a Train of frightful Monſters at
his Heels, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd fiercely the <hi>Manſion-Houſe,</hi> whence all the
Company ran haſtily away; and the louder the Maſter call'd after them, ſo
much the faſter they continued running.</p>
            <p>AS ſoon as we were got into the <hi>Square</hi> (alas! <hi>fuit
Ilium!</hi>) I mean the Spot, where the Square <hi>had ſtood</hi>; all the
Palaces, were vaniſh'd; and turn'd, methought, into an <hi>Orchard</hi> of
<hi>Crab-Trees:</hi> With whoſe Fruit, a Croud of <hi>fine Gentlemen,</hi>
who were running away in their Shirts, were pelted without Mercy, by red
<hi>Furies,</hi> to whoſe <hi>Favourites</hi> (a Number of <hi>Vintners</hi>
and <hi>lucky Gameſters</hi>) they had, but juſt before, transferr'd their
<hi>Birth-right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is impoſſible to expreſs the Anguiſh, the Deſpair, of
theſe <hi>unlanded</hi> Gentlemen; ſome tore down Branches, and accuſing
one another for the Seduction of ill Example, form'd a Battle with
diſmember'd <hi>Crab-Trees:</hi> others hang'd themſelves among the Boughs,
at the Approach of ill-look'd Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who ſurrounded them in their New
<hi>Orchard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE next was an Aſſembly of Men of <hi>Wit</hi>;
conſiſting of a <hi>Poet,</hi> an <hi>Orator,</hi> a
<hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> a <hi>Mathematician,</hi> a <hi>Divine,</hi> a
<hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> 
               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:0199100802:471"/> 
               <hi>Officer,</hi> the <hi>fine
Gentleman,</hi> who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them all, and an <hi>Eunnch,</hi> who ſung
in the <hi>Opera.</hi>—The <hi>Poet</hi> recited a <hi>Hymn</hi> to
<hi>Bacchus</hi> of his own Compoſing—The <hi>Orator,</hi> with great
Gracefulneſs, harangu'd upon the Force of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> which he
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Warmth of <hi>Wine</hi>—The <hi>Philoſopher</hi>
ſet <hi>Cato</hi>'s <hi>Virtue</hi> before them, as held <hi>ſteady,</hi>
by the <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Drinking.</hi>—The <hi>Divine</hi>
averr'd, That, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Wine made the Face of a Man to</hi>
SHINE, and prov'd it very <hi>ſoberly,</hi> by ſhewing its <hi>Effects</hi>
upon his own <hi>illuminated</hi> Countenance.—The <hi>Mathematician</hi>
produc'd a <hi>Pun,</hi> and ſaid, He lov'd a full <hi>Gage,</hi> becauſe
it was the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Meaſure:</hi> And to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
exactly, was the <hi>Duty</hi> of his Proſeſſion.—The
<hi>Officer</hi> commended <hi>Wine,</hi> as a great Inflamer of
<hi>Courage</hi>; and quoted a <hi>Dutch</hi> Author, in Defence of the Uſe
of <hi>Drinking,</hi> in Times of <hi>War:</hi> And the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Service of
<hi>Auxillary Brandy.</hi>—The <hi>fine Gentleman</hi> expatiated on the
Advantage to be reap'd by entertaining ſuch polite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when
aſſembled over a <hi>Bottle</hi>; and ordered the <hi>Fury</hi> that
attended them, to put round the Glaſs: At which the <hi>Eunuch</hi> began to
<hi>ſing,</hi> and the whole Company clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their Hands, and roar'd out
<hi>Encore,</hi> and <hi>Bravo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NO ſooner had the Glaſs gone round, but the <hi>Orator</hi>
propos'd <hi>Method</hi> to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Argument</hi>; and
inſiſted, that All <pb n="465" facs="tcp:0199100802:472"/> ſhould talk in their
<hi>Turns</hi>; which, as ſoon as any began to do, he broke in upon his own
Rule; and gallop'd, with a bawling Voice, through <hi>Diviſions</hi> and
<hi>Subdiviſions,</hi> 'till he had <hi>diſunited</hi> the whole
Company.—The <hi>Poet,</hi> thought he had equal Right to the Uſe of
his Tongue, and roſe to aſſert it, in an exorbitant Manner, juſt as he
found he had loſt the Uſe of it.—The <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi> cried
out, in vain, That Men muſt labour to ſubdue their Paſſions; and, to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them how eaſy it was, fell into ſo <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> a one
himſelf, that he knock'd down the poor <hi>Poet,</hi> with a Club, called
<hi>Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Baccilinum</hi>; For, ſays he, there is no <hi>other</hi> Way
of <hi>diſputing</hi> againſt thoſe who deny <hi>firſt
Principles;</hi>—The <hi>Divine,</hi> ſeeing a <hi>Philoſopher</hi>
turn <hi>Murderer,</hi> and talk, at the ſame Time of <hi>Principles,</hi>
thunder'd out <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>'s againſt <hi>Diſputing at all,</hi> where
the Buſineſs, they met for, was <hi>Drinking.</hi>—The
<hi>Mathematician</hi> was muttering <hi>Problems,</hi> and tracing out a
<hi>Globe</hi> upon the Table, with his <hi>Fingers</hi> dipt in the
<hi>Liquor</hi> that the Scufflers had <hi>ſpilt</hi> upon it; and the
<hi>fine-bred Gentleman</hi> to aſſiſt the Depth of his important
Deſigns, was pouring more Wine, to that which was ſpilt already, leſt he
might want a Supply of Liquor; But juſt as the Figure was upon the Point of
being finiſhed, the Officer ſwore it made <hi>dull Company,</hi> and rubb'd
it out with his Sleeve: The <hi>Mathematician</hi> ſeeing his <hi>Globe
defac'd,</hi> cried, The <hi>World was at an</hi> 
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:0199100802:473"/>
               <hi>End</hi>; to which the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> agreeing,
and the reſt of the Company deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, they fell all together by the Ears,
and ſqueezed the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to Death, while he was trying the Influence
of his <hi>Muſick</hi> againſt <hi>Madneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the Fury was juſt going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them to their
Senſes again, that they might perform over the ſame Exerciſe, (which they
do, it ſeems, every Hour, juſt as ſtrange Sights are ſhewn in Fairs, or
as Drunken Men renew their waking Debauches, after a little Interval of Sleep
in their Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) I left them, with a pungent Regret, that there ſhould be
in Liquor ſuch a Power of turning <hi>Strength</hi> into <hi>Weakneſs,
Health</hi> into <hi>Sickneſs, Beauty</hi> into <hi>Deformity, Riches</hi>
into <hi>Poverty, Friendſhip</hi> into <hi>Murder, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> into
<hi>Folly,</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> into <hi>Madneſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I WAK'D, with no ſmall Wonder at this ſleeping Ramble of my
Imagination: But turning over a Collection of Old News-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, bound up in
Volumes, from the <hi>Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> gradually downward, I found them
fill'd with Yearly Proofs, that Men act the very ſame Follies,
<hi>waking</hi> in this World, that I had been Dreaming were done in the
other.</p>
            <p>THERE I found Accounts of Men of great Eſtates, dead in a
Priſon, from the Effects of Drinking:—Quarrels every jot as
fantaſtical as any I have been deſcribing—There were Accounts of Men
caſting Lots, <pb n="467" facs="tcp:0199100802:474"/> in their Liquor, which ſhould be
<hi>hang'd,</hi> and which the <hi>Hangman</hi>;—Here were fine
Hiſtories of others, who, in a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Bravado, had drank the Health of
the <hi>Devil,</hi> in a Punch-bowl ſeaſon'd with <hi>Opium,</hi> and
launch'd down, while the Humour was on 'em, to pay a Viſit to their grateful
Patron.—I look'd back as far as the Time, when certain wild Beaſts,
called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hocks,</hi> had broke looſe, here in <hi>London</hi>; and I
found that it was no new Thing for Generals, and Common Soldiers, Lords,
Watchmen, and Drawers, Counts, Coblers and Hackney-Coachmen, to engage in
<hi>no unequal</hi> Matches together, and fight with all the <hi>Triumph</hi>
of <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi>; nay, what is more, I found all this as duly
<hi>repeated here,</hi> as I dreamt it to be in the Lower Regions.</p>
            <p>WHILE I was thus poring over my News Papers, and reflecting, that
the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> tallied exactly (as to its Extravagance)
with the Dreams of his diſorder'd <hi>Fancy,</hi> I heard a Noiſe in the
Street, as if all <hi>Barbican</hi> were in an Uproar, and looking out of my
Window, I ſaw Men with gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Staves, and an Air of exerted Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
knocking down a Set of roaring little <hi>Heroes,</hi> with <hi>Leeks</hi> in
their Hats.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the Matter, I was told, by an Arch-Wag
(ſmiling, as if he derided my Ignorance) That it was nothing, but a few
<hi>Welſhmen</hi>; who were got <hi>Loyally</hi> 
               <pb n="468" facs="tcp:0199100802:475"/>
               <hi>Drunk,</hi> and did ſober People a Miſchief, in Honour of the good
Saint, their <hi>Patron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I RESOLV'D then (as extravagant as my Thoughts ſeem'd to me
before, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>remov'd</hi> out of Nature) to pen them down;
ſince I found, ſuch Perſons did <hi>really exiſt,</hi> as I had
believ'd, Imagination could only <hi>ſhadow,</hi> in the prepoſterous
Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a Dream.—It may, thought I, be of <hi>Uſe,</hi>
to ſhew Men, who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to this Vice, their Pictures, plac'd in the
fulleſt Point of Abſurdity: And, ſince moſt of them take <hi>Hell</hi>
to be a <hi>Dream,</hi> it is natural enough to expect, that a <hi>Dream</hi>
of <hi>Hell</hi> may divert them.</p>

Leave, with no ſmall Difficulty, to retire, at laſt, into the Country; and
living there, but <hi>Seven Years,</hi> in a quiet and peaceful Privacy,
enjoyed more ſolid Satisfaction, than he had ever reap'd before, from all his
long Life, ſpent in Hurry, Danger, and Diſtinction: So that, coming, at

the Great CZAR of RUSSIA. It was ſent me by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to whoſe Hands it

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p> PERCEIVING, that it is cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for you, to receive
Letters from our Sex, I am willing to throw myſelf into your Protection, in
Hopes of meeting with a favourable Regard from you, and that you may
aſſiſt me in my Diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p> I AM a young Woman of ſome Fortune, and of no mean
Extraction; and was, ſome Months ago, the <hi>Happieſt Woman in the
World:</hi> My Story, in ſhort, is this: There was a young Gentleman, every
way ſuperior <pb n="476" facs="tcp:0199100802:483"/> to myſelf, thought fit to make his
Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to me. At firſt I concluded, from the Inequality of our
Fortunes, that he did it purely for a little Diverſion; but, by I know not
what kind of Infatuation, I was ſoon perſwaded, to believe he was juſt
and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in his Pretenſions. From hence, there ſprang an Intimacy
between us, which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable Time, and which, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought
would have a Period, 'till Death had ſeparated us for ever: But, behold the
Viciſſitudes and Changes of Life! the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Turns of Fortune! which
no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnn Foreſight can prevent: When I thought myſelf almoſt arrived to
the higheſt Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of earthly Happineſs, <hi>Strephon,</hi> the unkind
<hi>Strephon!</hi> forſook me, and bereft me of all my Joys, and Hopes, at
once.</p>
                  <p> IT is to me very ſurprizing, that ſo intimate a
Correſpondence, which was carried on with ſo much pretended Satisfaction,
on his Part, ſhou'd now be ſo irkſome to him, as to make him avoid my
Company, and even the very Sight of me. I cannot pretend to penetrate into his
<hi>Thoughts,</hi> but I am ſure his <hi>Actions</hi> always carried in them
the Marks of a real and unfeigned Paſſion. He ſeem'd ever ſtudious, to
<hi>divert</hi> and <hi>pleaſe</hi> me; and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, with a
<hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Reſpect,</hi> which is not common, even in the
moſt <hi>paſſionate Lover.</hi> It is now, I think, two Months ſince he
payed me a Viſit; nor have I heard from him, to let me know the Reaſon of
his <pb n="477" facs="tcp:0199100802:484"/> Abſence, which, together with ſome private
Intimations I have had from others, gives me ſufficient Grounds to believe he
is <hi>falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> AND is it poſſible! after ſuch an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Behaviour, he
ſhould abandon, nay, <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the Perſon he once appear'd ſo
much to admire! Are theſe his Proteſtations of <hi>eternal Love!</hi> Is
<hi>this</hi> his <hi>Friendſhip?</hi> Has he ſo ſoon forgot his Vows, of
Conſtancy and Fidelity? <hi>Who,</hi> even of the moſt <hi>Wiſe</hi> and
<hi>Prudent,</hi> could have ſuſpected, much leſs diſcern'd
<hi>Deceit,</hi> under the fair Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſo much ſeeming
<hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</hi> I was ſo far from diſtruſting
him, whom, I thought, the <hi>Virtuous</hi> and <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Strephon,</hi>
that I put my whole Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him, and was innocently betray'd, by the
irreſiſtable Charms of his Eloquence.</p>
                  <p> I HAVE wrote to him, ſeveral Times, ſince he has left me;
but either my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were intercepted, or he is wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of them;
for I have not, as yet, received an Anſwer; nor can I, by any Means, inform
myſelf, what has been the Cauſe of his unkind Separation. For this
Reaſon, I take this publick Opportunity, both to ask your Advice, in ſo
critical a Juncture, and to convince him, of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous Treatment of
one, for whom he pretended, once, to have the moſt unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Veneration.
If you think fit, to give this Letter a Place, in one of your Papers, I know it
will come to his Hands; and, <pb n="478" facs="tcp:0199100802:485"/> perhaps, ſuch a Memorial,
under your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Protection, may have a greater Influence over him
than any common Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. I deſire therefore you will inſert it, and
oblige your moſt humble Servant,</p>

                  <p> IT is a common Obſervation, That Trees that <hi>Bloſſom
ſooneſt,</hi> are liable to be ſooneſt Froſt nipt. As if Nature, by
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the full Growth of ſuch forward Virtues, miſtook the
Progreſs of Years, and meaſured <hi>Maturity</hi> not by <hi>Age,</hi> but
by <hi>Character.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> I MOURN the Miſery, Mr. PLAIN DEALER, of having lately loſt
a <hi>Friend,</hi> whoſe Picture I will preſent you with, as it is drawn to
the Life, in my Memory!—</p>
                  <p> IN Buſineſs there was a <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> always
triumphing over his Hurry; ſuch a Suavity and Complacence in his Behaviour,
as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the <hi>Heart,</hi> before the <hi>Head</hi> could have Time to
<hi>weigh</hi> him. He was ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to no Paſſion, but
<hi>Love,</hi> which made him a Friend to all Mankind, nor could thoſe narrow
Limits of Soul, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Mens <hi>Friendſhips</hi> to their
<hi>Intereſts,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain <pb n="479" facs="tcp:0199100802:486"/> his boundleſs
Generoſity, which made him <hi>Every Body's,</hi> who had
<hi>Miſeries,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Compaſs of his Eaſing. He had ſo
feveriſh a <hi>Thirſt</hi> of <hi>Obliging,</hi> that an Enemy would have
call'd his Liberality rather his <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> than his
<hi>Ornament.</hi> He ſought for no Reward, but the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of
thoſe he favour'd; and if at any Time it was not in his Power to
<hi>grant,</hi> he was more aſham'd, and unſatisfied, than the Perſon
whom he diſappointed; and, by way of Atonement, injoined himſelf the
Penance of <hi>watching</hi> for ſome <hi>happier</hi> Opportunity, when he
cou'd meet the Wiſh above half way, and prevent its Explanation.</p>
                  <p> NOR did this Benevolence of his Nature extend only to thoſe
within the Sphere of his Acquaintance; whoſe-ever Misfortunes came to his
Knowledge, made an equal, and noble Impreſſion;—For he
<hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated</hi> all Mens Griefs, till he had leſſen'd them, by
<hi>Comforts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> IF there were any ſo Ungenerous as to make him their
<hi>Enemy,</hi> he was as willing to forgive, as they to offer the
Injury.—Judge, then, how happy muſt thoſe few have been, who were
bleſt with his Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy! Whatever Tenderneſs is conceived in Nature from
Mothers to their new-born Infants, may deſerve to paſs as ſome faint
Image of his Sweetneſs:—His Faith, and his Friendſhips, were as
laſting as his <hi>Life</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="480" facs="tcp:0199100802:487"/> WITH all theſe Advantages, never had
Man an humbler Opinion of himſelf; which was an Armor that defended him,
againſt the <hi>Flattery</hi> of Fortune, as his Stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs deſpis'd her
<hi>Malice.</hi> To <hi>Him,</hi> to be <hi>High</hi> or <hi>Low,</hi> were
Accidents merely indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: The one cou'd neither exalt, nor cou'd the other
depreſs his Sentiments: And had Heaven thought fit to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted his
Body, like his Mind, from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, He had been as well <hi>Immortal</hi>
as <hi>Ineſtimable.</hi> The faſhionable Vanities which allure and
captivate young Hearts, could never get Admittance into his maſculine, and
diſcerning Boſom, always guarded by Reaſon and Virtue. He renounc'd, in
the Pride of his Youth, thoſe Enjoyments which others content themſelves
with diſclaiming, when the Power of poſſeſſing them is either loſt
or abated; Oh! I am left in a <hi>Deſart,</hi> without this Guide, that my
fond Soul hung upon! And nothing remains, but the Influence of his
<hi>Example,</hi> that can be worth the Wiſh of any Man, who had the
Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be acquainted with him.—</p>
                  <p> IN Juſtice to his Memory, allow this little Specimen of my
departed Friend, a Place in one of your Papers, and you will much oblige,</p>

                  <p> I HAVE had ſuch an Over-mind to ſee you, that I came to
Town on purpoſe, being a Kind of <hi>Plain Dealer</hi> myſelf. For tho'f I
am a Country Fellow, and no <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Scollard, yet I reckon myſelf the
wiſeſt in our whole Pariſh, except (mayhap) the Parſon: And he is ſo
churliſh, that one dare not <hi>deal plainly</hi> with him. I believe you to
be no proud Man, and that made me ſo bold as to come to ſeek you out, being
in hopes to have told our Parſon, that I had converſed, in my Time, with as
<hi>Learned</hi> a Man as he.</p>
                  <p> GOOD Maſter PLAIN DEALER, be ſo kind as to tell a Body, in
your next Paper, where you may be ſound, and rather than loſe the Sight of
ſo good-natur'd, an old Man, I will come once more on purpoſe, tho'f I
ſhou'd have no other Buſineſs. When I enquired after you, I thought I
ſhou'd ne'er have found you out; but then, at laſt, I was told, by a very
young Man, that you was to be met with, at the <hi>Tower</hi> of
<hi>Barbican.</hi>—Z'lids, I was never ſo ſo glad in all my
Life-time; but ſoon after I found I had nothing to be glad on, and I doubt
the Rogue put the <hi>City-Bite</hi> upon me; for I have ſearched every Crick
and Corner to find out ſuch a <hi>Tower,</hi> and could <pb n="482" facs="tcp:0199100802:489"/> get no News of it: <hi>Barbican</hi> I did find, and the
<hi>Tower</hi> I did find; but I cou'd find no <hi>Tower</hi> of
<hi>Barbican.</hi> I have worn out two Shooes by the Bargain, that were as good
as any two Pair I can get hereabouts. Pray, if there be any ſuch
<hi>Tower,</hi> and you live in it, I beſeech you to order Matters ſo, that
I may come to find it out.</p>
                  <p> I READ your Papers, and underſtand them as well as moſt
other Folks, all but your <hi>Top Sentences,</hi> which are generally ſo
hard, that they puzzle all our Pariſh. The beſt Scollards of us put our
Heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to find out their Meaning; and, when we can't agree about it,
we go to conſult our Parſon; and, I am ſorry to ſay it, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
a hard Judgment upon them.—He does not think it <hi>worth his
Trouble</hi> (he ſays) to <hi>underſtand</hi> Heathen <hi>Authors,</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Men were ſeldom good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>—But
this ſhall not prevent my Reading your Papers, for I have a better Opinion of
you, than to think ſo prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of any of your Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Being in over-great Haſte for the Country, have but juſt Time to put you in

                  <p> TURNING over the Works of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> lately
uſher'd into the World by an extravagant Subſcription, and finding the Six
Volumes, tho' called <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi>'s Works, contained not his VENUS
and ADONIS, his TARQUIN and LU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRECE, and numberleſs other Miſcellane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Pieces, which, for Richneſs of Fancy, and the many beautiful Deſcriptions
that adorn them, are far from being inferior to ſome of his more celebrated
Labours; I thought my ſelf obliged to become a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of the Seventh
Volume alſo, which appears to me, to have no Demerit to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion its
Excluſion.</p>

Lucubrations are ſo juſtly admir'd by all good Judges of Wit and Taſte,
will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge me the Tranſcription of a few of thoſe numberleſs natural
Beauties, which ſhine every where thro' theſe charming Pieces; and the
rather, becauſe I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, That this Volume, which is ſo
neceſſary and eſſential a Part of the Works of that inimitable Author,
has not, by ſome of the Wits in <hi>Leading-Strings,</hi> been look'd upon
with equal Favour; becauſe this Edition of it was not midwif'd into the
World, by the <hi>great Names</hi> that have condeſcended, for the
<hi>Emolument</hi> of the <hi>Publick,</hi> to ſhine in the Title Page of the
Firſt Six Volumes: But as this may take up more Room, than you will have to
ſpare in one Paper, I ſhall now and then occaſionally beg Leave, by your
Means, to recommend to the <hi>Implicite Witlings</hi> of the Age, thoſe
Beauties which might otherwiſe eſcape their Obſervation.</p>
                  <p> AND as it is impoſſible, where ever I open the Book, not to
be ſurprized with the Beauties of this great Genius, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your
Readers with the firſt that offer'd it ſelf; the Exclamation the violated

this unbounded Genius, forgetful indeed of her unfit Condition for Oratory,
whom he repreſents as thus Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, while he is forciby carried away by the
Stream of his own charming Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall only mention, That the
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription the Poet gives of her Riſing to the Morn, her Laſt Will, her
Parley with her Maid, the Maid's ſympathizing Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;

of the Picture he makes the unhappy Lady turn her Eyes to, of <hi>Troy</hi>
beleagur'd by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to avenge the Rape of <hi>Hellen</hi>;
which, for Strength of Deſcription, ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes any Thing of the like

            <p>I AM ſorry, after ſo kind a Reception as has been given to my
Speculations, that any Neceſſity ſhou'd ariſe, for my parting, a little
precipitately, with my good-natur'd Readers: But <hi>Love,</hi> however
faſhionable it is, among ſage Writers, to call it a <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> is
well known to act with a <hi>Strength,</hi> that is irreſiſtable: And I
need not inform Thoſe, who have perus'd me, long, or with any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
Degree of Attention, that <hi>Patty Amble</hi> holds an Influence over me, that
is too hard for all my Gravity; and breaks, like a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfly, thro' my Cobweb
Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>NO longer ago than Yeſterday Morning, there was nothing farther
from my Thoughts than the Diſcontinuance of my Weekly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: 
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:0199100802:501"/> But, about an Hour before Dinner, all my Purpoſes
received new Colours; and, I am, now, no longer what I <hi>was,</hi> before
this ſhort Billet metamorphos'd me.</p>

            <p>IT would be unreaſonable for any of my <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Readers to expect a better Excuſe than This, for my taking Leave of them,
ſo abruptly.—It is poſſible, however, that, <pb n="495" facs="tcp:0199100802:502"/>
when our <hi>firſt Hurry of Buſineſs</hi> is a little over, I may have
Leiſure, more than enough, to <hi>talk on,</hi> as I have done hitherto: But
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>Shape,</hi> I ſhall make my Appearance, is
a Matter I am wholly <hi>dark</hi> in.—This only I am ſure of, and
agree heartily with <hi>Her,</hi> in, That it muſt be any Thing rather than a
<hi>Plain Dealer</hi>; the Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if I am not miſtaken, of every
<hi>Wife,</hi> in Chriſtendom!</p>
            <p>BUT to ſoften as much as poſſible the Abruptneſs of my
Departure, it may not be amiſs to ſpend a little Converſation upon
thoſe agreeable Correſpondents, and indulgent Readers, which, in the
Courſe of this Work, I have met with: Next to the Pleaſure of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good,
the greateſt, is to meet with Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Aſſiſtance in our
Attempts towards it: This has been my Happineſs, and I hope it cannot be
attributed to any reproachable Weakneſs, when I confeſs I feel a Pang at
part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it. Barely to acknowledge amounts to Gratitude in thoſe People
whom Fortune does not enable to return a Benefit; that is, at preſent, my
Caſe: My approaching Fate will allow me to make no better a Payment than
Thanks, which therefore I deſire may be candidly accepted.</p>
            <p>WHEN I had written thus far, an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whom in ſome of
the preceding Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes I have recommended to the publick for a
Pertneſs of Conceit and Flippancy of Tongue, happened to come into my Room, 
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:0199100802:503"/> and taking up the Paper ran it haſtily over, then
throwing it down with a petulant Sneer, and a brisk Voice, cry'd out, 
<q rend="inline">"Foregad, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering your Sentiments, and
Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, grave Sir, I can't help comparing you to a Criminal taking
leave of the Bye-Standers with Tears in his Eyes, before his
Execution.—Faith, I long to ſee thee turn'd off, thoul't make the
prettieſt Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a <hi>Dangler:</hi> ha, ha,"</q>—Then, changing
his Allegory, continued his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence thus, 
<q rend="inline">"Matrimony, my good Friend, is a long and
tireſome Journey, and the worſt Road that ever you travell'd in—You
ſeem uneaſy, but ſure you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Conſcience be diſpleaſed that
I ſhould take up <hi>Plain-Dealing</hi> juſt where you left it off—If
you are, to make you Amends, I promiſe never to imitate you in any Thing,
particularly your laſt Reſolution of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that dreadful Sin of
Matrimony—Believe me, Friend, the Man that ſigns Marriage Articles,
gives it under his Hand that he's a Fool."</q>
            </p>
            <p>TO this I anſwered very gravely, That before I left off
<hi>Plain Dealing</hi> abſolutely, I was reſolved to give him one
Leſſon which might be of uſe to him in his Practice. 
<q rend="inline">"You are to remember, continued I, that he who
gives Advice, ſhould always take Care to do it in ſuch a Manner, that his
Advice may not appear to be an Inſult upon the Character or Underſtanding
of the Perſon <pb n="497" facs="tcp:0199100802:504"/> adviſed: <hi>Good Breeding</hi>
embelliſhes <hi>Good Senſe</hi>; and <hi>True Politeneſs</hi> is no more

            </p>
            <p>BUT to paſs by this volatile Spark, who if I divine aright, will
in every reſpect act like a modern fine Gentleman, that is, continue a
Batchelor till Sixty, to ſhew his <hi>Wit,</hi> and then marry his
Houſe-Keeper, to ſhew his <hi>Judgment</hi>; let me return to the
Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he interrupted, tho' I muſt take ſo much Notice of
his Opinion, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe my Readers if ever I appear again in Publick, I
ſhall amply and impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, by which Time perhaps my own
Obſervations and Experience will better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to make a clear and
ſatisfactory Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it.</p>
            <p>FAREWELL, then, Gentle Readers, be happy as I am ſhortly to be;
I have, on my part, endeavour'd to pleaſe; and you on yours have ſhewn
ſome Regard for my Endeavours: Till I can again attend you, I wiſh you
heartily a more agreeable Inſtructor; but think not my perſuading you to
<hi>good Humour</hi> at Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an Inconſiſtence in my Character; for
tho' I always abhorr'd Flattery, yet I never thought Truth the worſe for
being agreeably dreſs'd: The common Forms of Civility, tho' they are often
the Diſguiſes of Inſincerity, are no Diſgrace to an honeſt Heart, and
a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Where they are made uſe of to <hi>conceal</hi> our
