            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HIS GRACE THE Duke of BUCCLEUGH.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is with much pleaſure I embrace this opportunity of teſtifying my ſincere reſpect for YOUR GRACE's exalted character, as the friend and as the ornament of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by addreſſing theſe volumes to a name ſo much revered and beloved by the nation
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0247000201:5"/>whoſe poetry they are intended to preſerve and to illuſtrate.</p>
            <p>The chief compoſitions in this volume, MY LORD, will be found to breathe the living ſpirit of the Scotiſh people, a race of men who have left monuments of their martial glory in every country. YOUR GRACE, it is hoped, will with pleaſure here recogniſe the noble ardour your example lately tended to revive, by raiſing and commanding in perſon a military force in defence of your country, at a period when her natives had not diſcernment to perceive, nor ſpirit to aſſume, the privileges of Britiſh ſubjects.</p>
            <p>The ſecond volume, MY LORD, contains chiefly pieces deſcriptive of rural merriment, and of love and domeſtic happineſs. Even theſe, it is humbly believed, YOUR GRACE will not diſdain; for it is well known that the felicity of the poor in general, and of your numerous tenants and dependants in
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0247000201:6"/>particular, is regarded by YOUR GRACE as eſſential to your own. In reward, YOUR GRACE enjoys a domeſtic felicity now ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never known to the great who are generally obliged to exchange the free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of true pleaſure for the gaudy ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of oſtentation.</p>
            <p>At a period when many of the Britiſh nobility are waſting their patrimonial eſtates in profligate diſſipation; men trained to arms in defence of their rights and liberties, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages beautified and rendered ſalubrious, and their inhabitants rendered happy, have been the monuments of expence of the DUKE OF BUCCLEUGH.</p>
            <p>The ſilent gratitude of the poor will ever ſpeak YOUR GRACE's praiſes with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion unknown to the moſt exalted elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it were ſurely abſurd for any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enlarge on what is the common ſubject
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0247000201:7"/>of converſation, and known to all; I ſhall not therefore any longer intrude on YOUR GRACE's patience.</p>
            <p>That SCOTLAND may long conſider YOUR GRACE as one of the beſt guardians of her liberty, and the living aſſertor of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſpirit, is the earneſt wiſh of,</p>

               <head>DISSERTATION I. ON THE ORAL TRADITION OF POETRY.</head>
               <p>IT has long been a ſubject of regret, that the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the fine Arts have by oblivion been deprived of the reputation due to their memory. Of the many realms which lay claim to their birth, Egypt ſeems to poſſeſs the preference. Yet, like the Nile, which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that country, while they have diffuſed pleaſure and utility over kingdoms, their origin remains hid in the moſt profound obſcurity.</p>
               <p>That poetry holds a diſtinguiſhed ſuperiority over all theſe ſciences is allowed; yet the firſt practiſer of this enchanting art has loſt the renown it was deſigned to confer. We muſt either allow the conteſted claim of the Oſiris of the Egyptians, and Apollo of the Greeks, or be content to withhold from any, the fame which indeed ſeems due to as many inventors as there are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct nations in the world. For poetry appears not to
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0247000201:12"/>require the labour of diſquiſition, or aid of chance, to invent; but is rather the original language of men in an infant ſtate of ſociety in all countries. It is the effuſion of fancy actuated by the paſſions: and that theſe are always ſtrongeſt when uncontrouled by cuſtom, and the manners which in an advanced community are termed polite, is evident. But the peculiar advantages, which a certain ſituation of extrinſic objects confers on this art, have already been ſo well illuſtrated by emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent critics
<note n="*" place="bottom">Particularly Dr. Blackwell, in his Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer; and Dr. Blair, in his elegant Diſſertation on the Poems of Oſſian.</note>, that it is unneceſſary here to remember them. I have beſides noted a few ſuch as immediately concern the compoſitions now under view in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Diſſertation; and only propoſe here to give a brief account of the utility of the Oral Tradition of Poetry, in that barbarous ſtate of ſociety which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily precedes the invention of letters; and of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that conſpired to render it eaſy and ſafe.</p>
               <p>Among the Egyptians, probably the moſt ancient authors of the elegant, as well as uſeful ſciences, we find that verſes were originally uſed ſolely to preſerve the laws of their princes, and ſayings of their wiſe men from oblivion
<note n="†" place="bottom">Herodot. Diodor. Sicul. &amp;c.</note>. Theſe were ſometimes inſcribed in their temples in their hieroglyphic character, but more
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0247000201:13"/>frequently only committed to the memory of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders of their Law, or diſciples of their ſages. Pythagoras, who was initiated in their ſecret ſcience, conveyed in like manner his dictates to his diſciples, as appears from the moral verſes which paſs under his name at this day. And though the authenticity of theſe may be queſtioned, yet that he followed this mode of bequeathing his knowledge to his followers, is proved from the conſent of all antiquity
<note n="*" place="bottom">Jamblichus de vita Pythag. <hi>paſſim;</hi> and particularly <hi>lib.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. and 25.</note>. Nay, before him, Thales compoſed in like manner his Syſtem of Natural Philoſophy. And even ſo late as the time of Ariſtotle, the Laws of the Agathyrſi, a nation in Sarmatia, were all delivered in verſe. Not to mention the known laws of the Twelve Tables, which, from the fragments ſtill remaining of them, appear to have conſiſted of ſhort rythmic ſentences.</p>
               <p>From laws and religion poetry made an eaſy progreſs to the celebration of the Gods and Heroes, who were their founders. Verſes in their praiſe were ſung on ſolemn occaſions by the compoſers, or bards themſelves. We meet with many before Homer, who diſtinguiſhed themſelves by ſuch productions. Fabricius
<note n="†" place="bottom">In Bibliotheca Graeca, <hi>tom.</hi> I.</note> has enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated near ſeventy whoſe names have reached our times. That immortal author had the advantage of
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0247000201:14"/>hearing their poems repeated; and was certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to his predeceſſors for many beauties which we admire as original. That he was himſelf an ΑΟΙΔΟΣ, or Minſtrel, and ſung his own verſes to the lyre, is ſhown by the admirable author of the Enquiry into his Life and Writings
<note n="*" place="bottom">Sect. VIII.</note>. Nor were his poems reſcued from the uncertain fame of tradition, and committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting till ſome time after his death
<note n="†" place="bottom">Aelian. Var. Hiſt. lib. xiii. c. 14.</note>.</p>
               <p>Such was the utility of the poetic tradition among the more poliſhed nations of antiquity: and with thoſe they denominated Barbarians we find it no leſs practiſed
<note n="‡" place="bottom">The reader, who would deſire more intelligence on this head, may conſult a curious <hi>Diſſertation on the Monuments which ſupplied the Defect of Writing among the firſt Hiſtorians,</hi> by the Abbé Anſeſm, in Les Memoires de l'Academie des Inſcriptions, &amp;c.</note>. The Perſians had their Magi, who preſerved, as would ſeem in this way, the remarkable events of former times, and in war went before the army ſinging the praiſes of their illuſtrious men, whom the extraordinary gratitude and admiration of their countrymen had exalted into Deities. If they gained the victory, the Song of Triumph recorded the deeds of thoſe who had fallen, and by their praiſes animated the ambition of thoſe who enjoyed the conqueſt to farther acts of valour. The latter cuſtom
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0247000201:15"/>was in uſe ſtill more anciently among the Jews, as appears from the ſongs of Moſes

Theſe may be conſidered as affecting the paſſions and the ear. Their mode of expreſſion was ſimple and genuine. They of conſequence touched the paſſions truly and effectively. And when the paſſions are engaged, we liſten with avidity to the tale that ſo agreeably affects them; and remember it again with the moſt prompt facility. This may be obſerved in children, who will forget no circumſtance of an intereſting ſtory, more eſpecially if ſtriking or dreadful to the fancy; when they cannot remember a ſhort maxim which only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies the judgement. The paſſions of men have been and will be the ſame through all ages. Poetry is the ſovereign of the paſſions, and will reign while they

               <p>As the ſubjects of theſe genuine painters of nature deeply intereſted the heart, and by that means were ſo agreeable and affecting, that every hearer wiſhed to remember them; ſo their mode of conſtructing their verſe was ſuch, that the remembrance was eaſy and expeditious.

               <p n="1">1. The frequent returns of the ſame ſentences and deſcriptions expreſſed in the very ſame words. As for inſtance, the delivery of meſſages, the deſcription of battles, &amp;c. of which we meet with infinite examples in Homer, and ſome, if I miſtake not, in Oſſian. Good ones may be found in Hardyknute, Part I. v. 123, &amp;c. compared with part II. v. 107, &amp;c. and in Child Maurice, v. 31, with v. 67; and innumerable ſuch in the ancient Traditional Poetry of all nations. Theſe ſerved as land marks, in the view of which the memory travelled ſecure over the intervening ſpaces. On this head falls likewiſe to be mentioned what we call The Burden, that is, the unvaried repetition of one or more lines fixing the tone of the poem throughout the whole. That this is very ancient among the barbaric nations, may be gathered from the known Song of Regner
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0247000201:23"/>Lodbrog, to be found in Olaus Wormius
<note n="*" place="bottom">Regner Lodbrog, King of Denmark, flouriſhed in the Ninth Century.</note>; every ſtanza of which begins with one and the ſame line. So many of our ballads, both ancient and modern, have this aid to the memory, that it is unneceſſary to condeſcend on any in particular.</p>

This poem was written about 1350. There is a remarkable ſimilarity in its ſtyle and manner with thoſe very curious pieces of ancient Scotiſh poetry, ſtyled The Prophecies of Thomas Rymer, Marvellous Merling, Beid, Berlington, Waldhave, Eltraine, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and Sybilla, printed at Edinburgh in 1615, and reprinted from that edition, 1742, 8vo.

His reaſons are only founded on the modern appearance of ſome particular paſſages. That they have been modernized and corrupted, I will readily allow; but that they are on the main nearly as ancient as Rymer's time, who died about the beginning of the 14th Century, I believe the learned muſt confeſs from intrinſic evidence, in ſuch caſes the ſureſt of all. Not to mention that Sir David Lindſay, who wrote in the reign of James V. is an undoubted witneſs that they muſt be more ancient than this eminent Antiquary would infer.

                     </p>
                     <p>This exordium is evidently retouched by a modern hand.—But very many of the paſſages ſeem to ſtand in their original form, as the following lines, which are all in the Saxon manner, will teſtify:

               <p>I imagine, however, they are all the compoſures of one hand; and, if I may uſe a conjecture, were written immediately after the viſions of Pierce Plowman, every Engliſh poem of note in thoſe days being ſoon ſucceeded by an imitation in Scotland.</p>

<note n="*" place="bottom">Le Clerc, Biolioth. Univerſelle, tom. IX.</note>, has ſhewn that it is common in Scripture. All the Pſalms conſiſt of riming verſes, and many other paſſages which he names. They were uſed among the Greeks ſo early as the time of Gorgias the Sicilian, who taught the Athenians this practice. And though the ſpirit of the Greek and Latin languages did not always admit of them in poetry, yet they were uſed as occaſional beauties by their moſt celebrated writers. Homer, Heſiod, and Virgil, have a few, though ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently more from chance than deſign. The ancient Saturnine verſes were all rimes, as an old commentator
<note n="†" place="bottom">Servius ad Georg. II. ver. 386.</note> informs us. And it is more than probable they were ſo conſtructed merely that the memory might the more eaſily preſerve them, their licence forbidding their being committed to writing. Thoſe who would wiſh to know more particularly the univerſality of this mode of verſifying among the other ancient nations, may conſult the <hi>Huetiana</hi> of the moſt learned and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Biſhop of Avranches
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sect. 78.</note>. The Eaſtern poetry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts altogether, if I miſtake not, of riming lines, as may be obſerved in the ſpecimens of Hafiz their moſt
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:0247000201:28"/>illuſtrious writer, lately publiſhed
<note n="*" place="bottom">Jones, Comment. Poeſeos Aſiaticae—Richardſon's Specimen of Perſian Poetry.</note>. It appears, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that alliteration ſupplied the place of rime with the Northern nations till within a recent period
<note n="†" place="bottom">Ol. Worm. Lit. Run. p. 165 &amp; 176.</note>. Oſſian's poetry, I ſuppoſe, is in ſtanzas ſomething like our ballad meaſure; though it were to be wiſhed the tranſlator had favoured us with ſome information on this head evidenced by ſpecimens of the original. He indeed acquaints us that <q>Each verſe was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with thoſe which preceded, or followed it, that if one line had been remembered in a ſtanza, it was almoſt impoſſible to forget the reſt
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Diſſert. on the Era of Oſſian, p. 228, ed. 1773.</note>:</q> but this ſtands greatly in need of explanation.</p>
               <p>The common ballad ſtanza is ſo ſimple, that it has been uſed by moſt nations as the firſt mode of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing rimes. The Spaniſh romanzes bear a great reſemblance in this, as in other reſpects, to the Scotiſh Ballads. In both, every alternate line ends with ſimilar vowels, though the conſonants are not ſo ſtrictly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. As for inſtance, in the former we have <hi>bana, eſpada; mala, palabra; vega, cueva; rompan, vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos;</hi> for rimes: and in the later, <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:0247000201:29"/>paid more attention to the correſpondence of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants, as may be obſerved in the curious Collection publiſhed by Dr. Percy.</p>
               <p>As the ſimplicity of this ſtanza rendered it eaſy to the compoſer, and likewiſe more natural to expreſs the paſſions, ſo it added to the facility of recollection. It's tone is ſedate and ſlow. The rimes occur ſeldom, and at equal diſtances: though when a more violent paſſion is to be painted, by doubling the rimes, they at once expreſſed the mind better, and diverſified the harmony. Of this the reader will obſerve many inſtances in this collection, as, <hi>Here maun I lie, here maun I die: Like beacon bricht at deid of nicht: Na river heir, my dame, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <head>DISSERTATION II. ON THE TRAGIC BALLAD.</head>
               <p>THAT ſpecies of poetry which we denominate Ballad, is peculiar to a barbarous period. In an advanced ſtate of arts, the Comic Ballad aſſumes the form of the Song or Sonnet, and the Tragic or Heroic Ballad that of the higher Ode.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of our pleaſure in ſeeing a mournful event repreſented, or hearing it deſcribed, has been attempted to be explained by many critics
<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtotle, Scaliger, Dubos, Trapp in his Praelections, Hume, Eſſay on Tragedy; but, above all, Mr. Burke in his Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful.</note>. It ſeems to ariſe from the mingled paſſions of Admiration of the art of the author, Curioſity to attend the termination, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ariſing from a reflection on our own ſecurity, and the Sympathetic Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:0247000201:31"/>In giving this pleaſure, perhaps the Tragic Ballad yields to no effort of human genius. When we peruſe a poliſhed Tragedy or Ode, we admire the art of the author, and are led to praiſe the invention; but when we read an unartful deſcription of a melancholy event, our paſſions are more intenſely moved. The laboured productions of the informed compoſer reſemble a Greek or Roman temple; when we enter it, we admire the art of the builder. The rude effuſions of the Gothic Muſe are like the monuments of their Architecture. We are filled with a religious reverence, and, forgetting our praiſe of the contriver, adore the preſent deity.</p>
               <p>I believe no Tragic Ballad of renowned Antiquity has reached our times, if we deny the beautiful and pathetic CARMEN DE ATY in Catullus a title to this claſs; which, as a modern critic of note has obſerved
<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on the writings and genius of Pope, <hi>p.</hi> 324. 3d <hi>ed.</hi>
                  </note>, ſeems a tranſlation from ſome Greek <hi>Dithyrambic</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">The <hi>Dithyrambics</hi> were Heroic Songs, written with the higheſt glow of poetic fancy in honour of the ancient deities. Ariſtotle informs us, that the Greek Tragedy originated from them; as their Comedy did from their Paſtoral Love Songs.</note>, far more ancient than the times of that poet. His tranſlation of Sappho's Ode might ſhew that he took a delight in the ancient Greek compoſitions, from which indeed he ſeems to have derived in a great meaſure his peculiarly delicate vein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:0247000201:32"/>But it was with the nations in a ſtate of barbarity that this effuſion of the heart flouriſhed as in it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſoil; their ſocieties, rude and irregular, were full of viciſſitudes, and every hour ſubject to the moſt dreadful accidents. The Miniſtrels, who only knew, and were inſpired by the preſent manners, caught the tale of mortality, and recorded it for the inſtruction and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of others. It pleaſed by moving the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and, at the ſame time, afforded caution to their auditors to guard againſt ſimilar miſ-adventures.</p>
               <p>It is amuſing to obſerve how expreſſive the poetry of every country is of its real manners. That of the Northern nations is ferocious to the higheſt degree. Nor need we wonder that thoſe, whoſe laws obliged them to decide the moſt trifling debate with the ſword
<note n="*" place="bottom">Frotho etiam III. Danorum rex, quemadmodum Saxo, lib. V. refert, de qualibet controverſia ferre decerni ſanxit: ſpecioſius vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus quam verbis, confligendum exiſtimans. <hi>Schedius de diis Ger. Syng.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 46.</note>, delighted in a vein of poetry, which only painted deeds of blood, and objects horrible to the imagination. The ballad poetry of the Spaniards is tinged with the romantic gallantry of the nation. The hero is all complaiſance; and takes off his helmet in the heat of combat, when he thinks on his miſtreſs. That of the Engliſh is generous and brave. In their moſt noble ballad, Percy laments over the death of his
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:0247000201:33"/>mortal foe. That of the Scots is perhaps, like the face of their country, more various than the reſt. We find in it the bravery of the Engliſh, the gallantry of the Spaniſh, and I am afraid in ſome inſtances the ferocity of the Northern.</p>
               <p>A late writer
<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſcellanies by John Armſtrong, M.D. vol. II. p. 254.</note> has remarked, that, <q>the Scottiſh tunes, whether melancholy or gay, whether amorous, martial, or paſtoral, are in a ſtyle highly original, and moſt feelingly expreſſive of all the paſſions from the ſweeteſt to the moſt terrible.</q> He proceeds, <q>Who was it that threw out thoſe dreadful wild ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of diſtraction and melancholy in <hi>Lady Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſs's Dream?</hi> an old compoſition, now I am afraid loſt, perhaps becauſe it was almoſt too terrible for the ear.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This compoſition is neither loſt, nor is it too terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the ear. On the contrary, a child might hear it repeated in a winter night without the ſmalleſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A copy

                     <p>The lady Culroſs here meant was Elizabeth daughter of Sir James Melvil of Halhill, and wife of John Colvil Commendator of Culroſs. She is believed to have been the mother of Samuel Colvil the ſatyrical poet, author of the Scots Hudibras, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The Pathetic is the other principal walk of the Tragic Muſe: and in this the Scotiſh Ballads yield to no compoſitions whatever.

Were ever the feelings of a fond mother expreſſed in a language equal in ſimplicity and pathos to that of lady Bothwell?—This leads me to remark, that the dialect in which the Scotiſh Ballads are written gives them a great advantage in point of touching the paſſions. Their language is rough and unpoliſhed, and ſeems to flow immediately from the heart

The Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles, the Athalie of Racine, the Merope of Maffei, and even the very excellent Drama, which ſeems immediately founded on it, not excepted; there being many delicate ſtrokes in this original, which the plot adopted by that author forbade his making proper uſe of.

The Hiſtory of the Civil Wars of Granada is a well-written narration of thoſe diſſentions which tore that kingdom in pieces, for ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the period that Ferdinand and Iſabella, king and queen of Chriſtian Spain, conquered it, down to the time of conqueſt. The chief ſources of thoſe diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were the two great <hi>Vandos,</hi> or factions, of the Zegris and the Abencerrages; whoſe exploits and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, with thoſe of their adherents, are here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played with a minute detail that ſavours very ſtrongly of romance, though the great outlines of the work are evidently founded on hiſtorical truth; which, if the
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:0247000201:41"/>reader pleaſes, is indeed only another name for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpecies of romance.</p>
               <p>This Hiſtory, as we learn from the work itſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe, is a tranſlation from the Arabic of an anonymous Moor, who fled to Africa with many of his countrymen, when Granada was yielded to the arms of Ferdinand. His grandſon, by name Argutaafa, found this work among his grandfather's papers, and preſented it to a Jew, called Rabbi Santo, who tranſlated it into He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew; and gave the Arabic Original to Don Rodrigo Ponce de Leon, Conde de Baylen. That lord being intereſted by it, as his anceſtors had been concerned in the wars there related, ordered the Jew to tranſlate it into Caſtillan Spaniſh; and afterwards gave the tranſlation to the Spaniſh editor, whoſe name from the firſt edition, Barcelona printed by Seb. Matevad, 1610, appears to be Ginez Perez.</p>
               <p>On almoſt every occaſion the author produces ſome romanze, as the voucher of his incidents, tranſlations of a few of which ſhall now be produced. It muſt, however, be premiſed, that the firſt tranſlation is merely meant to convey to the reader an idea of the verſe in which moſt of the originals are written; for which purpoſe one of the feebleſt was choſen, as, had ſtrength of thought or incident been attempted in this way, the ſpirit would have totally evaporated in the midſt of attention to the double rimes, of which the Engliſh language is remarkably penurious.</p>

                  <p>HARDYKNUTE.] This name is of <hi>Daniſh</hi> extract, and ſignifies <hi>Canute the ſtrong. Hardy</hi> in the original implies <hi>ſtrong,</hi> not <hi>valiant;</hi> and though uſed in the latter ſenſe by the Engliſh, yet the Scots ſtill take it in its firſt acceptation. <q>The names in Cunningham,</q> ſays Sir David Dalrymple, <q>are all Saxon, as is the name of the country itſelf.</q> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Scotland, <hi>an.</hi> 1160, <hi>note.</hi> The <hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> are both derived from the old <hi>Gothic,</hi> and were ſo ſimilar, that a perſon of the one nation might underſtand one of the other ſpeaking in his proper tongue. From the names and whole tenor of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0247000201:179"/>this poem, I am inclined to think the chief ſcene is laid in Cunninghamſhire; where likewiſe the <hi>battle of Largs,</hi> ſuppoſed to be that ſo nobly deſcribed in the firſt part, was fought.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Britons.</hi>] This was the common name which the Scots gave the Engliſh anciently, as may be obſerved in their old poets; and particularly <hi>Blind Harry,</hi> whoſe teſtimony indeed can only be relied on, as to the common language and manners of his time; his Life of Wallace being a tiſſue of the moſt abſurd fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ever mingled.</p>

                  <p>A curious account of the riſe and progreſs of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and its influence on ſociety, may be found in a learned and ingenious work lately publiſhed by Dr. Stuart, intitled, <hi>A view of Society in Europe, or Enquiries concerning the Hiſtory of Law, Government, and Manners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>V. 16. <hi>Emergard.</hi>] In the common copies it is Elenor, and indeed in all the recitals I have heard; but in a late edition publiſhed with other Scotiſh ſongs at Edinburgh, 1776, it is rightly read as here. <hi>Emergard,</hi> or <hi>Ermengarde,</hi> was daughter of the Viſcount of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0247000201:182"/>and wife of William the Lyon. She died in 1233 As the name was uncommon, and of difficult pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, the rehearſers ſeem to have altered it to <hi>Elenor,</hi> which has none of theſe defects.</p>
                  <p>The battle of Largs, ſuppoſed to be that meant in this poem, was fought on the firſt of Auguſt 1263, ſo that queen Emergard was dead thirty years before; yet this can amount to no error in chronology, as the verſes evidently imply that the lady of Hardyknute <hi>had</hi> no equal in the kingdom for beauty ſave the queen in the prime of the youth and beauty of both, which might well be forty years, or more, before the period of action in the poem.</p>
                  <p>V. 25. <hi>Fairly.</hi>] This name ſeems likewiſe of Saxon origin. There is a ſmall iſland and a rivulet in Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham ſtill called <hi>Fairly iſle</hi> and <hi>Fairly Burn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>V. 43. <hi>Twenty thouſand glittering ſpeirs,</hi> &amp;c.] This agrees with Buchanan's account, <hi>Acho—viginti millia militum expoſuit.</hi> lib. 7. Torfaeus aſſerts this number of the Norwegians was left dead on the field; but upon what authority I know not, as the ancient relations of the battle of Largs ſupport not his teſtimony. See <hi>Johnſtone's Tranſlation of Haco's Expedition to Scotland in the year</hi> 1263, <hi>from the Plateyan and Friſian MSS.</hi> printed at Copenhagen 1782.</p>
                  <p>V. 49. <hi>Page</hi>] The Pages in the periods of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry were of honourable account. The young war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0247000201:183"/>were firſt denominated <hi>pages,</hi> then <hi>valets,</hi> or <hi>damei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaux,</hi> from which degree they reached that of <hi>ecuyer,</hi> or <hi>ſquire,</hi> and from this that of <hi>knight.</hi> See <hi>Du Cange,</hi> voc. <hi>Valeti,</hi> &amp; <hi>Domicellus.

                  <p>V. 61. <hi>He has tane a horn;</hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>horn,</hi> or <hi>bugil,</hi> was anciently uſed by the Scots inſtead of the trumpet. They were ſometimes richly ornamented, as appears from Lindſay's deſcription of that of Sir Robert Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. <q>The horn he wore was adorned with jewels and precious ſtones, and tipped with fine gold at both ends. <bibl>

                  <p>V. 107—112.] This minute deſcription might lead us to ſuſpect, that a female hand had ſome part in this compoſition. But, before our minſtrel, Homer has ſhewn
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0247000201:184"/>himſelf an adept in the lady's dreſs. To the curious remarks on the variation of the Britiſh habit, given us by Mr. Walpole, in his <hi>Anecdotes of Painting,</hi> and Mr. Granger, in his <hi>Biographical Hiſtory,</hi> might be added the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice from a reverend miniſter of the church of Scotland. <q>About 1698 the women got a cuſtome of wearing few garments: I myſelfe have ſeen the young briſk ladies walking on the ſtreets with maſks on their faces, and with one onlie thin petticoat and their ſmoak; ſo thin that one would make a conſcience of ſweiring they were not naked.</q>

                  <p>V. 112. <hi>Save that of Fairly fair.</hi>] Working at the needle, &amp;c. was reckoned an honourable employment by the greateſt ladies of thoſe times. Margaret, the queen of Malcolm III. as we learn from her life written by <hi>Turgot</hi> her confeſſor, employed the leiſure hours of her ladies in this manner. See Lord Hales' <hi>Annals of Scotland,</hi> an. 1093.</p>
                  <p>V. 121. <hi>Sir Knicht.</hi>] <q>The addition <hi>Sir</hi> to the names of knights was in uſe before the age of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I. and is from <hi>Sire,</hi> which in old French ſignifies <hi>Seignieur</hi> or Lord.

It is ſurpriſing it's omiſſion was not marked in the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment formerly publiſhed, as without it the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the knight's complaint is altogether foreign and vague. The loſs was attempted to be gloſſed over by many variations of the preceding four lines, but the defect was palpable to the moſt inattentive peruſer.</p>
                  <p>V. 154. <hi>Lord Chattan.</hi>] This is a very ancient and honourable Scottiſh ſurname. Some genealogiſts derive them from the <hi>Chatti,</hi> an ancient German tribe; but others, with more probability, from the <hi>Gilchattan</hi> of Ireland. St. <hi>Chattan</hi> was one of the firſt Scotiſh confeſſors, to whom was dedicated the priory of <hi>Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chattan</hi> in Lorn, founded in 1230, and ſome others through the kingdom. The chief of the clan <hi>Chattan</hi> dying in the reign of David I. without male iſſue, the clan aſſumed the anceſtor of the <hi>M'Pherſons</hi> for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, by which means the name appears to have been loſt in that of <hi>M'Pherſon.</hi> See <hi>Buchanan's Brief Enquiry into the Genealogy and Preſent State of Ancient Scottiſh Surnames.</hi> Glaſgow, 1723, 4 to, <hi>p.</hi> 67.</p>
                  <p>We however find the Clan Chattan mentioned as late as 1590 in <hi>The Hiſtory of the Feuds and Conflicts of the Clans, publiſhed from a MS. of the reign of James VI.</hi> Glaſgow, 1764; where a Macintoſh is called their chief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0247000201:187"/>V. 159.] Though we learn from <hi>Buchanan's Equiry,</hi> &amp;c. that the clan <hi>Chattan</hi> are ſaid to have come into Scotland long before the expulſion of the Picts, yet I do not find this pretty anecdote, which is much in the ſpirit of Homer, has any foundation in hiſtory.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0247000201:188"/>and its notes, eſpecially in the quick movement, ſo mixed and huddled together, that a ſtranger finds it almoſt impoſſible to reconcile his ear to it, ſo as to perceive its modulation. Some of theſe <hi>pibrochs,</hi> being intended to repreſent a battle, begin with a grave mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſembling a march, then gradually quicken into the onſet; run off with noiſy confuſion, and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rapidity, to imitate the conflict and purſuit; then ſwell into a few flouriſhes of triumphant joy; and perhaps cloſe with the wild and ſlow wailings of a funeral proceſſion. <bibl>

That this lady may have indeed received a MS. of it as mentioned in Dr. Percy's introductory note, is highly probable. Many valuable MSS. prepared for the preſs, have had a worſe fate. But that ſhe was the author of this capital compoſition, ſo fraught with ſcience of ancient manners as the above notes teſtify, I will no more credit, than that the common people in Lanarkſhire,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0247000201:199"/>who can repeat ſcraps of both the parts, are the authors of the paſſages they rehearſe. That ſhe did not refuſe the name of being the original compoſer is a ſtrange argument: would not the firſt poet in Europe think it added to his reputation? If conjecture may be allowed where proof muſt ever be wanting, I ſuſpect, if we aſſign the end of the fifteenth century as the date of the antique parts of this noble production, we ſhall not greatly err; though at the ſame time the language muſt convince us that many ſtrokes have been beſtowed by modern hands.</p>
                  <p>Since the firſt publication of this volume, Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hales, whoſe abilities have been ſo often, and ſo ſucceſsfully, exerted in illuſtrating the antiquities of his country, to the law and the literature of which he is ſo great an ornament, has communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Editor ſome notices with regard to this poem of Hardyknute, which ſhall here be laid before the reader, almoſt in his own words.</p>
                  <p>The following are extracts of a letter written by Sir John Bruce of Kinroſs, to Lord Binning, about the year 1719.</p>

                     <q>To perform my promiſe, I ſend you a true copy of the manuſcript I found, ſome weeks ago, in a vault at Dumferline. It is written on vellum in a fair Gothic character; but ſo much defaced by time, as you'll find that the tenth part is not legible.</q>

                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0247000201:200"/>Sir John tranſcribes ſome ſtanzas, which he calls <hi>verſes.</hi> After l. 112, P. I. he ſays, <q>here are four verſes defaced,</q> and then he tranſcribes l. 113.</p>
                  <p>At l. 128 he adds, <hi>hiatus in MS.</hi> and then he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes l. 153. At l. 320 he ſays, <q>Here are ten verſes (ſtanzas) ſo ſpoilt that I can only gueſs by the many proper names, that they contain the order of battle of the Scots army, as they ſtood ranged under their different chieftains.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In concluſion Sir John ſays, <q>there's a vaſt deal more of it, but all defaced.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reader is left to judge whether this ſtory of the manuſcript on vellum, &amp;c. has moſt the appearance of a true narrative, or of a <hi>jeu d' eſprit</hi> addreſſed to a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friend.</p>
                  <p>Lord Hales has a copy of the original edition of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyknute, with MS. alterations, in the hand writing of Dr. John Clerk, Phyſician in Edinburgh. At l. 85, it has '<hi>brade</hi> Thomas;' Sir John Bruce has <q>

                     <q>
                        <hi>P.</hi> Now I pray you come on to that fourt kynd of ſpreittis. <hi>E.</hi> That fourt kynde of Spreitis, quhilk be the gentiles was called Diana and her wandring court, and amongs us was called the <hi>Pharie</hi> (as I tolde you) or our guid neighbouris</q> (the King has added on the margin 'or ſillie wightis') <q>was ane of the ſortis of alluſions that was ryfeſt in tyme of Papiſtrie; for all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was holdin odious to propheſie be the devill, yet whome theſe kynd of ſpreittis caried away, and informed, thay wer thought to be ſoncieſt, and of beſt lyfe. To ſpeak of the manie vaine tratlis foundit upon that illuſion; how thair was ane king and queine of <hi>Pharie,</hi> of ſic a jolie court and traine as thay had; how thay had a teind and a dewtie, as it wer, of all guidis: how thay naturallie raid and yeld, eat and drank, and did all other actions lyke naturall men and wemen; I think it is lyker Virgilis <hi>Campi Eliſei,</hi> nor any thing that aught to be beleived be Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianis.</q>

                  <p>This Manuſcript is written in a beautiful Italic hand, ſo nearly reſembling copper-plate engraving, as to have been taken for ſuch even after accurate examination. It is bound in gilded vellum, ſtamped with the King's eypher beneath the crown; and is in all probability the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0247000201:213"/>original copy of this royal monument of ſuperſtition. Many additions are inſerted on the margin, as would ſeem, of the hand-writing of James VI. and ſome notes for his own private uſe. As for inſtance on <hi>B.</hi> II. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. ſpeaking of the Magicians of his time, over againſt the words <q>Thay are ſume of thame riche and worldlie wyſe,</q> he has noted <hi>F. M.</hi>

                  <p>We need not wonder at the ſeverity with which the imaginary crime of withcraft was puniſhed in his reign, when we remark his ſentiment expreſſed on this head, in <hi>B.</hi> III. <hi>ch.</hi> 6. of this ſingular tract. <q>
                        <hi>P.</hi> Then to make ane ende of our conference ſence I ſee it drawis leatt, what forme of puniſhment think ye merites thir Magiciens and Witches? For I ſee that ye account thame to be all alyke giltie. E. <hi>(The King) Thay aught to be put to deathe,</hi> according to the law of God, the civill and imperiall law, and the municipal law of all Chriſtiane nations. <hi>P.</hi> But what kynde of death I pray you? <hi>E.</hi> It is commonly uſed be fyre, but that is ane indifferent thing to be uſed in every countrey according to the law or cuſtume thairof. <hi>P. But aught no ſexe, aage, nor rank, to be eximed?</hi> E. NONE AT ALL.</q>

               <p>THESE verſes, though ſomewhat uncouth, are moving, as they ſeem to flow from the heart. They are now firſt publiſhed from the Editor's quarto Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, <hi>p.</hi> 16. corrected in ſome lines, which appeared too inaccurate for the publick eye. Two entire ſtanzas are rejected from the ſame cauſe. I know nothing of the nobleman to whom they are aſcribed.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Manuſcript <hi>(p.</hi> 17. and 116) are to be found the two following Poems, which I believe have never been in print. They are here added, with a few corrections. They were both written by Sir Robert Aytoun, who bore ſome office under government in the reign of James VI. if I miſtake not. His Latin poems are in the Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum.</p>
