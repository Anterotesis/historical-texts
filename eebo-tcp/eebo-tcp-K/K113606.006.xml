            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Bittern or Mire-drum.</head>
                  <p>THOSE who have walked in an evening by the ſedgy ſides of
unfrequented rivers, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a variety of notes from different
water-fowl: the loud ſcream of the wild gooſe, the croaking of the mallard,
the whining of the lapwing, and the tremulous neighing of the jack-ſnipe. But
of all thoſe ſounds, there is none ſo diſmally hollow as the booming of
the <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0823900106:5"/> bittern. It is impoſſible for words to give thoſe
who have not heard this evening-call an adequate idea of its ſolemnity. It is
like the interrupted bellowing of a bull, but hollower and louder, and is heard
at a mile's diſtance, as if iſſuing from ſome formidable being that
reſided at the bottom of the waters.</p>
                  <p>The bird, however, that produces this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying ſound is
not ſo big as an heron, with a weaker bill, and not above four inches long.
It differs from the heron chiefly in its colour, which is in general of a
paleiſh yellow, ſpotted and barred with black. Its wind-pipe is fitted to
produce the ſound for which it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the lower part of it dividing
into the lungs is ſupplied with a thin looſe membrane, that can be filled
with a large body of air and exploded at pleaſure. Theſe bellowing
explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are chiefly heard from the beginning of ſpring to the end of
autumn; and, however awful they may ſeem to us, are the calls to
court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or of connubial felicity.</p>
                  <p>From the loudneſs and ſolemnity of the note, many have
been led to ſuppoſe, that the bird made uſe of external inſtruments to
produce it, and that ſo ſmall a body could never eject ſuch a quantity of
tone. The common people are of opinion, that it thruſts its bill into a reed 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0823900106:6"/> that ſerves as a pipe for ſwelling the note above its
natural pitch; while others, and in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we find Thomſon the poet,
imagine that the bittern puts its head under water, and then violently blowing
produces its boomings. The fact is, that the bird is ſufficiently provided by
nature for this call; and it is often heard where there are neither reeds nor
waters to aſſiſt its ſonorous invitations.</p>
                  <p>It hides in the ſedges by day, and begins its call in the
evening, booming ſix or eight times, and then diſcontinuing for ten or
twenty minutes to renew the ſame ſound. This is a call it never gives but
when undiſturbed and at liberty. When its retreats among the ſedges are
invaded, when it dreads or expects the approach of an enemy, it is then
perfectly ſilent. This call it has never been heard to utter when taken or
brought up in domeſtic captivity; it continues under the control of man a
mute forlorn bird, equally incapable of attachment or inſtruction. But,
though its boomings are always performed in ſolitude, it has a ſcream which
is generally heard upon the ſeizing its prey, and which is ſometimes
extorted by fear.</p>
                  <p>This bird, though of the heron-kind, is yet neither ſo
deſtructive nor ſo voracious. It is a retired timorous animal, concealing
itſelf <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0823900106:7"/> in the midſt of reeds and marſhy places, and
living upon frogs, inſects, and vegetables; and though ſo nearly
reſembling the heron in figure, yet differing much in manners and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.
As the heron builds on the tops of the higheſt trees, the bittern lays its
neſt in a ſedgy margin, or amidſt a tuft of ruſhes. The heron builds
with ſticks and wool; the bittern compoſes its ſimpler habitation of
ſedges, the leaves of water-plants and dry ruſhes. The heron lays four
eggs; the bittern generally ſeven or eight, of an aſh-green colour. The
heron feeds its young for many days; the bittern in three days leads its little
ones to their food. In ſhort, the heron is lean and cadaverous,
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting chiefly upon animal food; the bittern is plump and fleſhy,
as it feeds upon vegetables when more nouriſhing food is wanting.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be, therefore, from its voracious appetites, but its
hollow boomb, that the bittern is held in ſuch deteſtation by the vulgar. I
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in the place where I was a boy with what terror this bird's note
affected the whole village; they conſidered it as the preſage of ſome
ſad event; and generally found or made one to ſucceed it. I do not ſpeak
ludicrouſly; but if any perſon in the neighbourhood died, they ſuppoſed
it could not be otherwiſe, for the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0823900106:8"/> night-raven had
foretold it; but if nobody hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to die, the death of a cow or a ſheep
gave completion to the prophecy.</p>
                  <p>Whatever terror it may inſpire among the ſimple, its
fleſh is greatly in eſteem among the luxurious. For this reaſon, it is as
eagerly ſought after by the fowler as it is ſhunned by the peaſant; and
as it is a heavy riſing, ſlow winged bird, it does not often eſcape him.
Indeed, it ſeldom riſes but when almoſt trod upon; and ſeems to ſeek
protection rather from conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than flight. At the latter end of autumn,
however, in the evening, its wonted indolence appears to forſake it. It is
then ſeen riſing in a ſpiral aſcent till it is quite loſt from the
view, making at the ſame time a ſingular noiſe very different from its
former boomings. Thus the ſame animal is often ſeen to aſſume different
deſires; and while the Latins have given the bittern the name of the ſtar
reaching bird (or the <hi>ſtellaris</hi>) the Greeks, taking its character
from its more conſtant habits, have given it the title of the

                  <p>AS we proceed in our deſcription of the crane kind, birds of
peculiar forms offer, not entirely like the crane, and yet not ſo far
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as to rank more properly with any other claſs. Where the long neck
and ſtilt-like legs of the crane are found, they make too ſtriking a
reſemblance, not to admit ſuch birds of the the number; and though the bill
or even the toes ſhould entirely differ, yet the outlines of the figure, and
the natural habits and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being the ſame, theſe are
ſufficient to mark their place in the general groupe of nature.</p>
                  <p>The Spoonbill is one of thoſe birds which differs a good
deal from the crane, yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches this claſs more than any other. The body
is more bulky for its height, and the bill is very differently formed from that
of any other bird whatever. Yet ſtill it is a comparatively tall bird; it
feeds among waters; its toes are divided; and it ſeems to poſſeſs the
natural diſpoſitions of the crane. The European ſpoonbill is of about the
bulk of a crane; but <pb facs="tcp:0823900106:10"/>

The common colour of thoſe of Europe, is a dirty white; but thoſe of
America are of a beautiful roſe colour, or a delightful crimſom. Beauty of
plumage ſeems to be the prerogative of all the birds of that continent; and
we here ſee the moſt ſplendid tints beſtowed on a bird, whoſe figure
is ſufficient to deſtroy the effects of its colouring; for its bill is ſo
odly faſhioned, and its eyes ſo ſtupidly ſtaring, that its fine
feathers only tend to add ſplendour to deformity. The bill, which in this
bird is ſo very particular, is about ſeven inches long, and running out
broad at the end, as its name juſtly ſerves to denote; it is there about an
inch and a half wide. This ſtrangely faſhioned inſtrument, in ſome is
black; in others of a light grey; and in thoſe of America, it is of a red
colour, like the reſt of the body. All round the upper chap there runs a kind
of rim, with which it covers that beneath; and as for the reſt, its cheeks,
and its throat, are without feathers, and covered with a black ſkin.</p>
                  <p>A bird ſo oddly faſhioned, might be expected to
poſſeſs ſome very peculiar appetites; but the ſpoonbill ſeems to
lead a life entirely reſembling all thoſe of the crane kind; and Nature,
when <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0823900106:14"/> ſhe made the bill of this bird ſo very broad,
ſeems rather to have ſported with its form, than to aim at any final
cauſe for which to adapt it. In fact, it is but a poor philoſophy to
aſcribe every capricious variety in nature to ſome ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary purpoſe:
in ſuch ſolutions we only impoſe upon each other; and often wilfully
contradict our own belief. There muſt be imperfections in every being, as
well as capacities of enjoyment. Between both, the animal leads a life of
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate felicity; in part making uſe of its many natural advantages, and in
part neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the imperfections of its figure.</p>
                  <p>The ſhoveler chiefly feeds upon frogs, toads and ſerpents;
of which, particularly at the Cape of Good Hope, they deſtroy great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
The inhabitants of that country hold them in as much eſteem as the ancient
Egyptians did their bird ibis: the ſhoveler runs tamely about their houſes;
and they are content with its ſociety, as a uſeful though an homely
companion. They are never killed; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are good for nothing when
they are dead, for the fleſh is unfit to be eaten.</p>
                  <p>This bird breeds in Europe, in company with the heron, in high
trees; and in a neſt formed of the ſame materials. Willoughby tells us,
that in a certain grove, at a village <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0823900106:15"/> called Seven Huys,
near Leyden, they build and breed yearly in great numbers. In this grove
alſo, the heron, the bittern, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant, and the ſhag, have taken up
their reſidence, and annually bring forth their young together. Here the
crane kind ſeem to have formed their general rendezvous; and, as the
inhabitants ſay, every ſort of bird has its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral quarter, where none
but their own tribe are permitted to reſide. Of this grove the peaſants of
the country make good profit. When the young ones are ripe, thoſe that farm
the grove, with a hook at the end of a long pole, catch hold of the bough on
which the neſt is built, and ſhake out the young ones; but ſometimes the
neſt and all tumble down together.</p>
                  <p>The ſhoveler lays from three to five eggs; white, and
powdered with a few ſanguine or pale ſpots. We ſometimes ſee, in the
cabinets of the curious, the bills of American ſhovelers, twice as big and as
long as thoſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon kind among us; but theſe birds have not yet
made their way into Europe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. The Flamingo.</head>
                  <p>THE Flamingo has the juſteſt right to be placed among
cranes; and though it happens to be web-footed, like birds of the gooſe kind,
yet its height, figure and appetites, entirely remove it from that groveling
claſs of animals. With a longer neck and legs than any other of the crane
kind, it ſeeks its food by wading among waters; and only differs from all of
this tribe in the manner of ſeizing its prey; for as the heron makes uſe of
its claws, the flamingo uſes only its bill, which is ſtrong and thick for
the purpoſe, the claws being uſeleſs, as they are feeble, and webbed like
thoſe of water-fowl.</p>
                  <p>The flamingo is the moſt remarkable of all the crane kind,
the talleſt, bulkieſt, and the moſt beautiful. The body, which is of a
beautiful ſcarlet, is no bigger than that of a ſwan; but its legs and neck
are of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary length, that when it ſtands erect, it is
ſix feet ſix inches high. Its wings, extended, are five feet ſix inches
from tip to tip; and it is four feet eight inches from tip to tail. The

a large bill, ſeven inches long, partly red, partly black, and crooked like a
bow. The legs and thighs, which are not much thicker than a man's finger, are
about two feet eight inches high; and its neck near three feet long. The feet
are not furniſhed with ſharp claws, as in others of the crane kind; but
feeble, and united by mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, as in thoſe of the gooſe. Of what uſe
theſe membranes are does not appear, as the bird is never ſeen ſwimming,
its legs and thighs being ſufficient for bearing it into thoſe depths where
it ſeeks for prey.</p>
                  <p>This extraordinary bird is now chiefly found in America, but
was once known on all the coaſts of Europe. Its beauty, its ſize, and the
peculiar delicacy of its fleſh, have been ſuch temptations to deſtroy or
take it, that it has long ſince deſerted the ſhores frequented by man,
and taken refuge in countries that are as yet but thinly peopled. In thoſe
deſert regions, the flamingos live in a ſtate of ſociety, and under a
better polity than any other of the feathered creation.</p>
                  <p>When the Europeans firſt came to America, and coaſted down
along the African ſhores, they found the flamingos on ſeveral ſhores on
either continent, gentle and no way diſtruſtful <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0823900106:19"/> of
mankind<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Albin's New Hiſtory of
Birds.</bibl>
                     </note>. They had long been uſed to ſecurity, in the
extenſive ſolitudes they had choſen; and knew no enemies, but thoſe
they could very well evade or oppoſe. The Negroes and the native Americans,
were poſſeſſed but of few deſtructive arts for killing them at a
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and when the bird perceived the arrow, it well knew how to avoid
it. But it was otherwiſe when the Europeans firſt came among them: the
ſailors, not conſidering that the dread of fire-arms was totally unknown in
that part of the world, gave the flamingo the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a fooliſh bird,
that ſuffered itſelf to be approached and ſhot at. When the fowler had
killed one, the reſt of the flock, far from attempting to fly, only regarded
the fall of their companion in a kind of fixed aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: another and
another ſhot was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; and thus the fowler often levelled the whole
flock, before one of them began to think of eſcaping.</p>
                  <p>But at preſent it is very different in that part of the
world; and the flamingo is not only one of the ſcarceſt but of the
ſhyeſt birds in the world, and the moſt difficult of approach. They
chiefly keep near the moſt deſerted and inhoſpitable ſhores; near
ſalt-water lakes and <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0823900106:20"/> ſwampy iſlands. They come down
to the banks of rivers by day; and often retire to the inland, mountainous
parts of the country at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of night. When ſeen by mariners in the
day, they always appear drawn up in a long cloſe line of two or three hundred
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and, as Dampier tells us, preſent, at the diſtance of half a
mile, the exact repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of a long brick wall. Their rank, however, is
broken when they ſeek for food; but they always appoint one of the number as
a watch, whoſe only employment is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and give notice of danger,
while the reſt are feeding. As ſoon as this truſty centinel perceives the
remoteſt appearance of danger, he gives a loud ſcream, with a voice as
ſhrill as a trumpet, and inſtantly the whole cohort are upon the wing. They
feed in ſilence; but, upon this occaſion, all the flock are in one chorus,
and fill the air with intolerable ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>From this it appears that the flamingos are very difficult to
be approached at preſent, and that they avoid mankind with the moſt
cautious timidity; however, it is not from any anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy to man that they
ſhun his ſociety, for in ſome villages, as we are aſſured by Labat,
along the coaſt of Africa, the flamingos come <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0823900106:21"/> in great
numbers to make their reſidence among the natives. There they aſſemble by
thouſands, perched on the trees, within and about the village; and are ſo
very clamorous, that the ſound is heard at near a mile diſtance. The
Negroes are fond of their company; and conſider their ſociety as a gift of
Heaven, as a protection from accidental evils. The French, who are admitted to
this part of the coaſt, cannot, without ſome degree of diſcontent, ſee
ſuch a quantity of game untouched, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered uſeleſs by the
ſuperſtition of the natives: they now and then privately ſhoot ſome of
them, when at a convenient diſtance from the village, and hide them in the
long graſs, if they perceive any of the Negroes approaching; for they would
probably ſtand a chance of being ill treated, if the blacks diſcovered
their ſacred birds were thus unmercifully treated.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, in their wild ſtate, they are ſhot by mariners;
and their young, which run ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively faſt, are often taken. Labat has
frequently taken them with nets, properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended round the places they breed
in. When their long legs are entangled in the meſhes, they are then
unqualified to make their eſcape: but they ſtill continue to combat with
their deſtroyer; and the old ones, though ſeized by <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0823900106:22"/>
the head, will ſcratch with their claws; and theſe, though ſeemingly
inoffenſive, very often do miſchief. When they are fairly diſengaged from
the net, they nevertheleſs preſerve their natural ferocity; they refuſe
all nouriſhment; they peck and combat with their claws at every opportunity.
The fowler is therefore under a neceſſity of deſtroying them, when taken;
as they would only pine and die, if left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in captivity. The
fleſh of the old ones is black and hard; though, Dampier ſays, well
taſted: that of the young ones is ſtill better. But, of all other
delicacies, the flamingo's tongue is the moſt celebrated. A diſh of
fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo's tongues, ſays our author, is a feaſt for an emperor. In fact,
the Roman emperors conſidered them as the higheſt luxury; and we have an
account of one of them, who procured fifteen hundred flamingo's tongues to be
ſerved up in a ſingle diſh. The tongue of this bird, which is ſo much
ſought after, is a good deal larger than that of any other bird whatever. The
bill of the flamingo is like a large black box, of an irregular figure, and
filled with a tongue which is black and griſtly; but what peculiar flavour it
may poſſeſs, I leave to be determined by ſuch as underſtand good
eating better than I do. It is probable, that the <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0823900106:23"/> beauty
and ſcarcity of the bird, might be the firſt inducements to ſtudious
gluttony to fix upon its tongue as meat for the table. What Dampier ſays of
the goodneſs of its fleſh, cannot ſo well be relied on; for Dampier was
often hungry, and thought any thing good that could be eaten: he avers, indeed,
with Labat, that the fleſh is black, tough and fiſhy; ſo that we can
hardly give him credit, when he aſſerts; that its fleſh can be formed
into a luxurious entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds, as was ſaid, always go in flocks together;
and they move in rank, in the manner of cranes. They are ſometimes ſeen, at
the break of day, flying down in great numbers from the mountains; and
conducting each other with a trumpet cry, that ſounds like the word Tococo,
from whence the ſavages of Canada have given them the name. In their flight
they appear to great advantage; for they then ſeem of as bright a red as a
burning coal. When they diſpoſe themſelves to feed, their cry ceaſes;
and then they diſperſe over a whole marſh, in ſilence and
aſſiduity. Their manner of feeding is very ſingular: the bird thruſts
down its head, ſo that the upper convex ſide of the bill ſhall only touch
the ground; and in this poſition the animal appears, as it were, ſtanding
upon <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0823900106:24"/> its head. In this manner it paddles and moves the
bill about, and ſeizes whatever fiſh or inſect happens to offer. For this
purpoſe the upper chap is notched at the edges, ſo as to hold its prey with
the greater ſecurity. Cateſby, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, gives a different account of their
feeding. According to him, they thus place the upper chap undermoſt, and ſo
work about, in order to pick up a ſeed from the bottom of the water, that
reſembles millet: but as in picking up this, they neceſſarily alſo
ſuck in a great quantity of mud, their bill is toothed at the edges, in
ſuch a manner as to let out the mud, while they ſwallow the grain.</p>
                  <p>Their time of breeding is according to the climate in which
they reſide: in North America they breed in our ſummer; on the other ſide
the line they take the moſt favourable ſeaſon of the year. They build
their neſts in extenſive marſhes, and where they are in no danger of a
ſurprize. The neſt is not leſs curious than the animal that builds it: it
is raiſed from the ſurface of the pool about a foot and a half, formed of
mud, ſcraped up together, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by the ſun, or the heat of the
bird's body: it reſembles a truncated cone, or one of the pots which we ſee
placed on chimnies; on the top it <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0823900106:25"/> is hollowed out to the
ſhape of the bird, and in that cavity the female lays her eggs, without any
lining but the well cemented mud that forms the ſides of the building. She
always lays two eggs, and no more; and, as her legs are immoderately long,
ſhe ſtraddles on the neſt, while her legs hang down, one on each ſide,
into the water.</p>
                  <p>The young ones are a long while before they are able to fly;
but they run with amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwiftneſs. They are ſometimes caught; and,
very different from the old ones, ſuffer themſelves to be carried home, and
are tamed very eaſily. In five or ſix days they become familiar, eat out of
the hand, and drink a ſurprizing quantity of ſea-water. But though they are
eaſily rendered domeſtic, they are not reared without the greateſt
difficulty; for they generally pine away, for want of their natural ſupplies,
and die in a ſhort time. While they are yet young, their colours are very
different from thoſe lively tints they acquire with age. In their firſt
year they are covered with plumage of a white colour, mixed with grey; in the
ſecond year the whole body is white, with here and there a ſlight tint of
ſcarlet; and the great covert feathers of the wings are black: the third year
the bird acquires all its beauty; the <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0823900106:26"/> plumage of the whole
body is ſcarlet, except ſome of the feathers in the wings, that ſtill
retain their ſable hue. Of theſe beautiful plumes, the ſavages make
various ornaments; and the bird is ſometimes ſkinned by the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, to
make muffs. But theſe have dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in heir price, ſince we have
obtained the art of dying feathers of the brighteſt ſcarlet.</p>

Runner.</head>
                  <p>THE extraordinary ſhape of the Avoſetta's bill might
incline us to wiſh for its hiſtory; and yet in that we are not able to
indulge the reader. Natural hiſtorians have hitherto, like ambitious
monarchs, ſhewn a greater fondneſs for extending their dominions, than
cultivating what they poſſeſs. While they have been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to add new
varieties to their catalogues, they have neglected to ſtudy the hiſtory of
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals already known.</p>
                  <p>The Avoſetta is chiefly found in Italy, and now and then
comes over into England. It is about the ſize of a pigeon, is a pretty
upright bird, and has extremely long legs for its ſize. But the moſt
extraordinary part of its figure, and that by which it may be diſtinguiſhed
from all others of the feathered tribe, is the bill, which turns up like a
hook, in an oppoſite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to that of the hawk or the parrot. This
extraordinary bill is black, flat, ſharp and flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible at the end, and about
three inches and an half long. From its being bare a long way 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0823900106:28"/> above the knee, it appears that it lives and wades in the
waters. It has a chirping, pert note, as we are told; but with its other habits
we are entirely unacquainted. I have placed it, from its ſlender figure,
among the cranes; although it is web-footed, like the duck. It is one of
thoſe birds of whoſe hiſtory we are yet in expectation.</p>
                  <p>To this bird of the crane kind, ſo little known, I will add
another, ſtill leſs known; the Corrira or Runner, of Aldrovandus. All we
are told of it is, that it has the longeſt legs of all web-footed fowls,
except the flamingo and avoſetta; that the bill is ſtraight, yellow and
black at the ends; that the pupils of the eyes are ſurrounded with two
circles, one of which is bay, and the other white: below, near the belly, it is
whitiſh; the tail, with two white feathers, black at the extremities; and
that the upper part of the body is of the colour of ruſty iron. It is thus
that we are obliged to ſubſtitute dry deſcription for inſtructive
hiſtory; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy words, to expreſs thoſe ſhadings of colour which
the pencil alone can convey.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. Of Small Birds of the Crane Kind, with the Thighs
partly bare of Feathers.</head>
                  <p>AS I have taken my diſtinctions rather from the general form
and manners of birds, than from their minuter though perhaps more preciſe
diſcriminations, it will not be expected that I ſhould here enter into a
particular hiſtory of a numerous tribe of birds, whoſe manners and forms
are ſo very much alike. Of many of them we have ſcarce any account in our
hiſtorians, but tedious deſcriptions of their dimenſions, and the colour
of their plumage; and of the reſt, the hiſtory of one is ſo much that of
all, that it is but the ſame account repeated to a moſt diſguſting
reiteration. I will therefore groupe them into one general draught; in which
the more eminent, or the moſt whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, will naturally ſtand forward on
the canvas.</p>
                  <p>In this groupe we find an extenſive tribe of native birds,
with their varieties and affinities; and we might add an hundred others, of
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant climates, of which we know little more than the colour and the name.
In this liſt is exhibited the Curlew, a bird of about the ſize 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0823900106:30"/> of a duck, with a bill four inches long: the Woodcock,
about the ſize of a pigeon, with a bill three inches long: the God wit, of
the ſame ſize; the bill four inches: the Green Shank, longer legged; the
bill two inches and an half: the Red Shank, differing in the colour of its feet
from the former: the Snipe, leſs by half, with a bill three inches. Then with
ſhorter bills—The Ruff, with a collar of feathers round the neck of the
male; the Knot, the Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piper, the Sanderling, the Dunlin, the Purre and the
Stint. To conclude; with bills very ſhort—The Lapwing, the Green
Plover, the Grey Plover, the Dottrel, the Turnſtone and the Sea-lark.
Theſe, with their affinities, are properly natives or viſitants of this
country; and are diſperſed along our ſhores, rivers and watery grounds.
Taking in the birds of this kind, belonging to other countries, the liſt
would be very widely extended; and the whole of this claſs, as deſcribed by
Briſſon, would amount to near an hundred.</p>
                  <p>All theſe birds poſſeſs many marks in common; though
ſome have peculiarities that deſerve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. All theſe birds are bare of
feathers above the knee, or above the heel, as ſome naturaliſts chuſe to
expreſs it. In fact, that part which I <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0823900106:31"/> call the knee, if
compared with the legs of mankind, is analogous to the heel: but, as it is
commonly conceived otherwiſe, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the general
apprehenſion. I ſay, therefore, that all theſe birds are bare of
fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers above the knee; and in ſome they are wanting half way up the thigh.
The nudity in that part, is partly natural, and partly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by all birds
of this kind habitually wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in water. The older the bird, the barer are its
thighs; yet even the young ones have not the ſame downy covering reaching
ſo low as the birds of any other claſs. Such a covering there would rather
be prejudical, as being continually liable to get wet in the water.</p>
                  <p>As theſe birds are uſually employed rather in running than
in flying, and as their food lies entirely upon the ground, and not on trees,
or in the air, ſo they run with great ſwiftneſs for their ſize, and the
length of their legs aſſiſts their velocity. But as, in ſeeking their
food, they are often obliged to change their ſtation; ſo alſo are they
equally ſwift of wing, and traverſe immenſe tracts of country without
much fatigue.</p>
                  <p>It has been thought by ſome, that a part of this claſs
lived upon an oily ſlime, found in <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0823900106:32"/> the bottoms of
ditches and of weedy pools; they were thence termed, by Willoughby,
Mud-ſuckers. But later diſcoveries have ſhewn that, in theſe places,
they hunt for the caterpillars and worms of inſects. From hence, therefore,
we may generally aſſert, that all birds of this claſs live upon animals
of one kind or another. The long billed birds ſuck up worms and inſects
from the bottom; thoſe furniſhed with ſhorter bills, pick up ſuch
inſects as lie nearer the ſurface of the meadow, or among the ſands on
the ſea-ſhore.</p>
                  <p>Thus the curlew, the wood-cock, and the ſnipe, are ever
ſeen in plaſhy brakes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der covered hedges, aſſiduouſly
employed in ſeeking out inſects in their worm ſtate; and it ſeems, from
their fatneſs, that they find a plentiful ſupply. Nature, indeed, has
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with very convenient inſtruments for procuring their food.
Their bills are made ſufficiently long for ſearching; but ſtill more,
they are endowed with an exquiſite ſenſibility at the point, for feeling
their proviſion. They are furniſhed with no leſs than three pair of
nerves, equal almoſt to the optic nerves in thickneſs; which paſs from
the roof of the mouth, and run along the upper chap to the point.</p>
                  <p>Nor are thoſe birds with ſhorter bills, and 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0823900106:33"/> deſtitute of ſuch convenient inſtruments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a
proper proviſion made for their ſubſiſtence. The lapwing, the
ſand-piper, and the red-ſhank, run with ſurprizing rapidity along the
ſurface of the marſh, or the ſea-ſhore, quarter their ground with great
dexterity, and leave nothing of the inſect kind that happens to lie on the
ſurface. Theſe, however, are neither ſo fat nor ſo delicate as the
former; as they are obliged to toil more for a ſubſiſtence, they are
eaſily ſatisfied with whatever offers; and their fleſh often contracts a
reliſh from what has been their lateſt, or their principal, food.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the birds formerly deſcribed, have ſtated
ſeaſons for feeding and reſt: the eagle kind prowl by day, and at evening
repoſe; the owl by night, and keeps unſeen in the day-time. But theſe
birds, of the crane kind, ſeem at all hours employed: they are ſeldom at
reſt by day; and, during the whole night ſeaſon, every meadow and marſh
reſounds with their different calls, to courtſhip or to food. This ſeems
to be the time when they leaſt fear interruption from man; and though they
fly at all times, yet, at this ſeaſon, they appear more aſſiduouſly
employed, both in providing for their preſent ſupport, and continuing that
of poſterity. This is uſually the ſeaſon when <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0823900106:34"/> the
inſiduous fowler ſteals in upon their occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, and fills the whole
meadow with terror and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>As all of this kind live entirely in waters, and among watery
places, they ſeem provided by Nature with a warmth of conſtitution to fit
them for that cold element. They reſide, by choice, in the coldeſt
climates; and as other birds migrate here in our ſummer, their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations
hither are moſtly in the winter. Even thoſe that reſide among us the
whole ſeaſon, retire in ſummer to the tops of our bleakeſt mountains;
where they breed, and bring down their young, when the cold weather ſets
in.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of them, however, migrate, and retire to the polar
regions; as thoſe that remain behind in the mountains, and keep with us
during ſummer, bear no proportion to the quantity which in winter haunt our
marſhes and low grounds. The ſnipe ſometimes builds here; and the neſt
of the curlew is ſometimes found in the plaſhes of our hills: but the
number of theſe is very ſmall; and it is moſt probable that they are only
ſome ſtragglers who, not having ſtrength or courage ſufficient for the
general voyage, take up from neceſſity their habitation here.</p>
                  <p>In general, during ſummer, this whole claſs 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0823900106:35"/> either chuſe the coldeſt countries to retire to, or
the coldeſt and the moiſteſt part of ours to breed in. The curlew, the
wood-cock, the ſnipe, the godwit, the grey plover, the green, and the long
legged plover, the knot and the turnſtone, are rather the gueſts than the
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this iſland. They viſit us in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of winter, and
forſake us in the ſpring. They then retire to the mountains of Sweden,
Poland, Pruſſia, and Lapland, to breed. Our country, during the ſummer
ſeaſon, becomes uninhabitable to them. The ground parched up by the heat;
the ſprings dried away; and the vermicular inſects already upon the wing;
they have no means of ſubſiſting. Their weak and delicately pointed bills
are unfit to dig into a reſiſting ſoil; and their prey is departed,
though they were able to reach its retreats. Thus, that ſeaſon when Nature
is ſaid to teem with life, and to put on her gayeſt liveries, is to them an
interval of ſterility and famine. The coldeſt mountains of the north are
then a preferable habitation; the marſhes there are never totally dried up;
and the inſects are in ſuch abundance, that, both above ground and
underneath, the country ſwarms with them. In ſuch retreats, therefore,
theſe birds would continue always; but that the froſts, when 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0823900106:36"/> they ſet in, have the ſame effect upon the face of the
landſcape, as the heats of ſummer. Every brook is ſtiffened into ice; all
the earth is congealed into one ſolid maſs; and the birds are obliged to
forſake a region where they can no longer find ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>Such are our viſitants. With regard to thoſe which keep
with us continually, and breed here, they are neither ſo delicate in their
food, nor perhaps ſo warm in their conſtitutions. The lapwing, the ruff,
the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhank, the ſand-piper, the ſea-pie, the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk plover, and the
ſea-lark, breed in this country, and, for the moſt part, reſide here. In
ſummer they frequent ſuch marſhes as are not dried up in any part of the
year; the Eſſex hundreds, and the fens of Lincolnſhire. There, in
ſolitudes formed by ſurrounding marſhes, they breed and bring up their
young. In win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they come down from their retreats, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered uninhabitable
by the flooding of the waters; and ſeek their food about our ditches and
marſhly meadow-grounds. Yet even of this claſs, all are wanderers upon
ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and take wing to the northern climates, to breed and find
ſubſiſtence. This happens when our ſummers are peculiarly dry; and when
the fenny countries are not ſufficiently watered to defend their
retreats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0823900106:37"/>But though this be the uſual courſe of
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with reſpect to theſe birds, they often break through the general
habits of their kind; and as the lapwing, the ruff, and the ſand-piper, are
ſometimes ſeen to alter their manners, and to migrate from hence, inſtead
of continuing to breed here; ſo we often find the wood-cock, the ſnipe and
the curlew, reſide with us during the whole ſeaſon, and breed their young
in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the country. In Caſewood, about two miles from
Tunbridge, as Mr. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant aſſures us, ſome wood-cocks are ſeen to breed
annually. The young have been ſhot there in the beginning of Auguſt; and
were as healthy and vigorous as they are with us in winter, though not ſo
well taſted. On the Alps, and other high mountains, ſays Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby, the
wood-cock continues all ſummer. I myſelf have fluſhed them on the top of
Mount Jura, in June and July. The eggs are long, of a pale red colour, and
ſtained with deeper ſpots and clouds. The neſts of the curlew and the
ſnipe are frequently found; and ſome of theſe perhaps never entirely
leave this iſland.</p>
                  <p>It is thus that the ſame habits are in ſome meaſure
common to all; but in neſtling, and bringing up their young, one method takes
place univerſally. As they all run and feed <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0823900106:38"/> upon the
ground, ſo they are all found to neſtle there. The number of eggs generally
to be ſeen in every neſt, is from two to four; never under, and very
ſeldom exceeding. The neſt is made without any art; but the eggs are either
laid in ſome little depreſſion of the earth, or on a few bents and long
graſs, that ſcarcely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from the moiſture below. Yet ſuch
is the heat of the body of theſe birds, that their time of incubation is
ſhorter than with any others of the ſame ſize. The magpie, for
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, takes twenty-one days to hatch its young; the lapwing takes but
fourteen. Whether the animal oil, with which theſe birds abound, gives them
this ſuperior warmth, I cannot tell; but there is no doubt of their quick
incubation.</p>
                  <p>In their ſeaſons of courtſhip, they pair as other birds;
but not without violent conteſts between the males, for the choice of the
fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. The lapwing and the plover are often ſeen to fight among
themſelves; but there is one little bird of this tribe, called the ruff, that
has got the epithet of the fighter, merely from its great perſeverance and
animoſity on theſe occaſions. In the beginning of ſpring, when theſe
birds arrive among our marſhes, they are obſerved to engage with
deſperate fury againſt each other; it is then that the fowlers, 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0823900106:39"/> ſeeing them intent on mutual deſtruction, ſpread
their nets over them, and take them in great numbers. Yet even in captivity
their animoſity ſtill continues: the people that fat them up for ſale,
are obliged to ſhut them up in cloſe dark rooms; for if they let ever ſo
little light in among them, the turbulent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners inſtantly fall to
fighting with each other, and never ceaſe till each has killed its
anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt, eſpecially, ſays Willoughby, if any body ſtands by. A
ſimilar animoſity, though in a leſs degree, prompts all this tribe; but
when they have paired, and begun to lay, their contentions are then over.</p>
                  <p>The place theſe birds chiefly chuſe to breed in, is in
ſome iſland ſurrounded with ſedgy moors, where men ſeldom reſort;
and in ſuch ſituations I have often ſeen the ground ſo ſtrewed with
eggs and neſts, that one could ſcarce take a ſtep, without treading upon
ſome of them. As ſoon as a ſtranger intrudes upon theſe retreats, the
whole colony is up, and an hundred different ſcreams are heard from every
quarter. The arts of the lapwing to allure men or dogs from her neſt, are
perfectly amuſing. When ſhe perceives the enemy approaching, ſhe never
waits till they arrive at her neſt, but boldly runs to meet them: when ſhe
has come <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0823900106:40"/> as near them as ſhe dares to venture, ſhe
then riſes with a loud ſcreaming before them, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if ſhe were
juſt fluſhed from hatching; while ſhe is then probably a hundred yards
from the neſt. Thus ſhe flies, with great clamour and anxiety, whining and
ſcreaming round the invaders, ſtriking at them with her wings, and
fluttering as if ſhe were wounded. To add to the deceit, ſhe appears
ſtill more clamorous, as more remote from the neſt. If ſhe ſees them
very near, ſhe then ſeems to be quite unconcerned, and her cries ceaſe,
while her ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are really augmenting. If there be dogs, ſhe flies heavily
at a little diſtance before them, as if maimed; ſtill vociferous and
ſtill bold, but never offering to move towards the quarter where her
treaſure is depoſited. The dog purſues, in hopes every moment of
ſeizing the parent, and by this means actually loſes the young; for the
cunning bird, when ſhe has thus drawn him off to a proper diſtance, then
puts forth her powers, and leaves her aſtoniſhed purſuer to gaze at the
rapidity of her flight. The eggs of all theſe birds are highly valued by the
lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious; they are boiled hard, and thus ſerved up, without any further
preparation.</p>
                  <p>As the young of this claſs are ſoon hatched, ſo, when
excluded, they quickly arrive at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0823900106:41"/> They run about
after the mother as ſoon as they leave the egg; and being covered with a
thick down, want very little of that clutching which all birds of the poultry
kind, that follow the mother indiſpenſably require. They come to their
adult ſtate long before winter; and then flock together, till the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeaſon returns, which for a while diſſolves their ſociety.</p>
                  <p>As the fleſh of almoſt all theſe birds is in high
eſtimation, ſo many methods have been contrived for taking them. That
uſed in taking the ruff, ſeems to be the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous; and it may
not be amiſs to deſcribe it. The Ruff, which is the name of the male, the
Reeve that of the female, is taken in nets about forty yards long, and ſeven
or eight feet high. Theſe birds are chiefly found in Lincolnſhire and the
Iſle of Ely, where they come about the latter end of April, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear
about Michaelmas. The male of this bird, which is known from all others of the
kind by the great length of the feathers round his neck, is yet ſo various in
his plumage, that it is ſaid, no two ruffs were ever ſeen totally of the
ſame colour. The nets in which theſe are taken, are ſupported by
ſticks, at an angle of near forty-five degrees, and placed either on 
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0823900106:42"/> dry ground, or in very ſhallow water, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from
reeds: among theſe the fowler conceals himſelf, till the birds, enticed by
a ſtale or ſtuffed bird, come under the nets: he then, by pulling a
ſtring, lets them fall, and they are taken; as are godwits, knots and grey
plover, alſo in the ſame manner. When theſe birds are brought from under
the net, they are not killed immediately, but fattened for the table, with
bread and milk, hemp-ſeed, and ſometimes boiled wheat; but if expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be wanted, ſugar is added, which will make them a lump of fat in a
fortnight's time. They are kept, as obſerved before, in a dark room; and
judgment is required in taking the proper time for killing them, when they are
at the higheſt pitch of fatneſs; for, if that is neglected, the birds are
apt to fall away. They are reckoned a very great delicacy; they ſell for two
ſhillings, or half a crown a piece; and are ſerved up to the table with the
train, like wood-cocks, where we will leave them.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. Of the Water-hen and the Coot.</head>
                  <p>BEFORE we enter upon water-fowls, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, two
or three birds claim our attention, which ſeem to form the ſhade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the web-footed tribe and thoſe of the crane kind. Theſe partake rather of
the form than the habits of the crane; and, though fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with long legs
and necks, rather ſwim than wade. They cannot properly be called web-footed;
nor yet are they entirely deſtitute of membranes, which fringe their toes on
each ſide, and adapt them for ſwimming. The birds in queſtion are, the
Water-hen, and the Bald Coot.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds have too near an affinity, not to be ranked in
the ſame deſcription. They are ſhaped entirely alike, their legs are
long, and their thighs partly bare; their necks are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, their
wings ſhort, their bills ſhort and weak, their colour black, their
foreheads bald and without feathers, and their habits entirely the ſame.
Theſe, however, naturaliſts have thought proper to range in different
claſſes, from very ſlight diſtinctions in their <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0823900106:44"/>
figure. The water-hen weighs but fifteen ounces; the coot twenty-four. The bald
part of the forehead in the coot is black; in the water-hen it is of a
beautiful pink colour. The toes of the water-hen are edged with a ſtraight
membrane; thoſe of the coot have it ſcolloped and broader.</p>
                  <p>The differences in the figure are but ſlight; and thoſe in
their manner of living ſtill leſs. The hiſtory of the one will ſerve
for both. As birds of the crane kind are furniſhed with long wings, and
eaſily change place, the water-hen, whoſe wings are ſhort, is obliged to
reſide en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely near thoſe places where her food lies: ſhe cannot take
thoſe long journeys that moſt of the crane kind are ſeen to perform;
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by her natural imperfections, as well perhaps as by inclination,
ſhe never leaves the ſide of the pond or the river in which ſhe ſeeks
for proviſion. Where the ſtream is ſelvaged with ſedges, or the pond
edged with ſhrubby trees, the water-hen is generally a reſident there:
ſhe ſeeks her food along the graſſy banks; and often along the
ſurface of the water. With Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear's Edgar, ſhe drinks the green
mantle of the ſtanding pool; or, at leaſt, ſeems to prefer thoſe places
where it is ſeen. Whether ſhe makes pond-weed her food, or hunts among it 
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0823900106:45"/> for water-inſects, which are found there in great
abundance, is not certain. I have ſeen them when pond-weed was taken out of
their ſtomach. She builds her neſt upon low trees and ſhrubs, of ſticks
and fibres, by the water ſide. Her eggs are ſharp at one end, white, with a
tincture of green ſpotted with red. She lays twice or thrice in a ſummer;
her young ones ſwim the moment they leave the egg, purſue their parent, and
imitate all her manners. She rears, in this manner, two or three broods in a
ſeaſon; and when the young are grown up, ſhe drives them off to ſhift
for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>As the coot is a larger bird, it is always ſeen in larger
ſtreams, and more remote from man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The water-hen ſeems to prefer
inhabited ſituations: ſhe keeps near ponds, motes, and pools of water near
gentlemen's houſes; but the coot keeps in rivers, and among ruſhy margined
lakes. It there makes a neſt of ſuch weeds as the ſtream ſupplies, and
lays them among the reeds, floating on the ſurface, and riſing and falling
with the water. The reeds among which it is built keep it faſt; ſo that it
is ſeldom waſhed into the middle of the ſtream. But if this happens,
which is ſometimes the caſe, the bird ſits in her neſt, like a mariner
in his boat, and ſteers with her legs her cargo into <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0823900106:46"/> the
neareſt harbour: there, having attained her port, ſhe continues to ſit in
great tranquility, regardleſs of the impetuoſity of the current; and though
the water penetrates her neſt, ſhe hatches her eggs in that wet
condition.</p>
                  <p>The water-hen never wanders; but the coot ſometimes ſwims
down the current, till it even reaches the ſea. In this voyage theſe birds
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter a thouſand dangers: as they cannot fly far, they are hunted by
dogs and men; as they never leave the ſtream, they are attacked and
deſtroyed by otters; they are preyed upon by kites and falcons; and they are
taken, in ſtill greater numbers, in weirs made for catching fiſh; for
theſe birds are led into the nets, while purſuing ſmall fiſh and
inſects, which are their principal food. Thus animated nature affords a
picture of univerſal invaſion! Man deſtroys the otter, the otter
deſtroys the coot, the coot feeds upon fiſh, and fiſh are univerſally
the tyrants of each other!</p>
                  <p>To theſe birds, with long legs and finny toes, I will add
one ſpecies more, with ſhort legs and finny toes: I mean the Grebe. The
entire reſemblance of this bird's appetites and manners to thoſe of the
web-footed claſs, might juſtly induce me to rank it among them; but as it
reſembles thoſe above deſcribed, in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0823900106:47"/>
form of its toes, and bears ſome ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude in its manners alſo, I will
for once ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice method to brevity. The grebe is much larger than either
of the former, and its plumage white and black: it differs alſo entirely in
the ſhortneſs of its legs, which are made for ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and not walking:
in fact, they are from the knee upward hid in the belly of the bird, and have
conſequently very little motion. By this mark, and by the ſcolloped fringe
of the toes, may this bird be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from all others.</p>
                  <p>As they are thus, from the ſhortneſs of their wings, ill
formed for flying, and from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſhortneſs of their legs, utterly
unfitted for walking, they ſeldom leave the water, and chiefly frequent
thoſe broad ſhallow pools where their faculty of ſwimming can be turned
to the greateſt advantage, in fiſhing and ſeeking their prey.</p>
                  <p>They are chiefly, in this country, ſeen to frequent the
meres of Shropſhire and Cheſhire; where they breed among reeds and flags,
in a floating neſt, kept ſteady by the weeds of the margin The female is
ſaid to be a careful nurſe of its young, being obſerved to feed them
moſt aſſiduouſly with ſmall eels; and when the little brood is tired,
the mother <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0823900106:48"/> will carry them, either on her back or under
her wings. This bird preys upon fiſh, and is almoſt perpetually diving. It
does not ſhew much more than the head above water; and is very difficult to
be ſhot, as it darts down on the appearance of the leaſt danger. It is
never ſeen on land; and, though diſturbed ever ſo often, will not leave
that lake where alone, by diving and ſwimming, it can find food and
ſecurity. It is chiefly ſought for the ſkin of its breaſt, the plumage
of which is of a moſt beautiful ſilvery white, and as gloſſy as
ſatin. This part is made into tippets; but the ſkins are out of ſeaſon
about February, loſing their bright colour; and in breeding-time their
breaſts are entirely bare.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of Water-fowl in General.</head>
                  <p>IN ſettling the diſtinctions among the other claſſes
of birds, there was ſome difficulty; one tribe encroached ſo nearly upon
the nature and habitudes of another, that it was not eaſy to draw the line
which kept them aſunder: but in water-fowl Nature has marked them for us by a
variety of indelible characters; ſo that it would be almoſt as unlikely to
miſtake a land-fowl for one adapted for living and ſwimming among the
waters, as a fiſh for a bird.</p>
                  <p>The firſt great diſtinction in this claſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in
the toes, which are webbed together for ſwimming. Thoſe who have remarked
the feet or toes of a duck, will eaſily conceive how admirably they are
formed for making way in the water. When men ſwim they do not open the
fingers, ſo as to let the fluid paſs through them; but cloſing them
together, preſent one broad ſurface to beat back the water, and thus puſh
their bodies along. What man performs by art, Nature has ſupplied to
water-fowl; and, by broad ſkins, has web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed their toes together, ſo that
they expand <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0823900106:51"/> two broad oars to the water; and thus, moving
them alternately, with the greateſt eaſe paddle along. We muſt obſerve
alſo, that the toes are ſo contrived, that as they ſtrike backward, their
broadeſt hollow ſurface beats the water; but as they gather them in again,
for a ſecond blow, their front ſurface contracts, and does not impede the
bird's progreſſive motion.</p>
                  <p>As their toes are webbed in the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient manner,
ſo are their legs alſo made moſt fitly for ſwift progeſſion in the
water. The legs of all are ſhort, except the three birds deſcribed in a
former chapter; namely, the flamingo, the avoſetta, and the corrira: all
which, for that reaſon, I have thought proper to rank among the crane kind,
as they make little uſe of their toes in ſwimming. Except theſe, all
web-footed birds have very ſhort legs; and theſe ſtrike, while they
ſwim, with greater facility. Were the leg long, it would act like a lever
whoſe prop is placed to a diſadvantage; its motions would be ſlow, and
the labour of moving it conſiderable. For this reaſon, the very few birds
whoſe webbed feet are long, never make uſe of them in ſwimming: the web
at the bottom ſeems only of ſervice as a broad baſe, to prevent them from
ſinking while they walk in the mud; but <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0823900106:52"/> it otherwiſe
rather retards than advances their motion.</p>
                  <p>The ſhortneſs of the legs in the web-footed kinds, renders
them as unfit for walking on land, as it qualifies them for ſwimming in their
natural element. Their ſtay, therefore, upon land, is but ſhort and
tranſitory; and they ſeldom venture to breed far from the ſides of
thoſe waters where they uſually remain. In their breeding ſeaſons,
their young are brought up by the water-ſide; and they are covered with a
warm down, to fit them for the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſituation. The old ones
alſo have a cloſer, warmer plumage, than birds of any other claſs. It is
of their feathers that our beds are compoſed; as they neither mat nor imbibe
humidity, but are furniſhed with an animal-oil, that glazes their furface,
and keeps each ſeparate. In ſome, however, this animal-oil is in too great
abundance; and is as offenſive from its ſmell as it is ſerviceable for
the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of houſehold oeconomy. The feathers, therefore, of all the
penguin kind, are totally uſeleſs for domeſtic purpoſes; as neither
boiling nor bleaching can diveſt them of their oily rancidity. Indeed, the
rancidity of all new feathers, of whatever water-fowl they be, is ſo
diſguſting, that our upholſterers give near <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0823900106:53"/> double
the price for old feathers that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford for new: to be free from ſmell,
they muſt all be lain upon for ſome time; and their uſual method is to
mix the new and the old together.</p>
                  <p>This quantity of oil, with which moſt water-fowl are
ſupplied, contributes alſo to their warmth in the moiſt element where
they reſide. Their ſkin is generally lined with fat; ſo that, with the
warmth of the feathers externally, and this natural lining more internally,
they are better defended againſt the changes or the inclemencies of the
weather, than any other claſs whatever.</p>
                  <p>As, among land-birds, there are ſome found fitted entirely
for depredation, and others for an harmleſs method of ſubſiſting upon
vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, ſo alſo among theſe birds there are tribes of plunderers,
that prey, not only upon fiſh, but ſometimes upon water-fowl themſelves.
There are likewiſe more inoffenſive tribes, that live upon inſects and
vegetables only. Some water-fowls ſubſiſt by making ſudden ſtoops
from above, to ſeize whatever fiſh come near the ſurface; others again,
not furniſhed with wings long enough to fit them for flight, take their prey
by diving after it to the bottom.</p>
                  <p>From hence all water-fowl naturally fall into three
diſtinctions. Thoſe of the Gull kind, that, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0823900106:54"/> with long
legs and round bills, fly along the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to ſeize their prey. Thoſe
of the Penguin kind, that, with round bills, legs hid in the abdomen, and
ſhort wings, dive after their prey: and thirdly; thoſe of the Gooſe kind,
with flat broad bills, that lead harmleſs lives, and chiefly ſubſiſt
upon inſects and vegetables.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are not ſpeculative diſtinctions, made up for the
arrangement of a ſyſtem; but they are ſtrongly and evidently marked by
Nature. The Gull kind are active and rapacious; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, except when they
breed, keeping upon the wing; fitted for a life of rapine, with ſharp
ſtraight bills for piercing, or hooked at the end for holding their fiſhy
prey. In this claſs we may rank the Albatroſs, the Cormorant, the Gannet or
Soland Gooſe, the Shag, the Frigate Bird, the Great Brown Gull, and all the
leſſer tribe of gulls and ſea-ſwallows.</p>
                  <p>The Penguin kind, with appetites as vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, bills as
ſharp, and equally eager for prey, are yet unqualified to obtain it by
flight. Their wings are ſhort, and their bodies large and heavy, ſo that
they can neither run nor fly. But they are formed for diving in a very peculiar
manner. Their feet are placed ſo far backward, and their legs ſo hid in the
abdomen, <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0823900106:55"/> that the ſlighteſt ſtroke ſends them head
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the bottom of the water. To this claſs we may refer the
Penguin, the Auk, the Skout, the Sea-turtle, the Bottle-noſe and the
Loon.</p>
                  <p>The Gooſe kind are eaſily diſtinguiſhable, by their
flat broad bills, covered with a ſkin; and their manner of feeding, which is
moſtly upon vegetables. In this claſs we may place the Swan, the Gooſe,
the Duck, the Teal, the Widgeon, and all their numerous varieties.</p>
                  <p>In deſcribing the birds of theſe three claſſes, I will
put the moſt remarkable of each claſs at the beginning of their
reſpective tribes, and give their ſeparate hiſtory: then, after having
deſcribed the chiefs of the tribe, the more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſorts will naturally
fall in a body, and come under a general deſcription, behind their leaders.
But before I offer to purſue this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical arrangement, I muſt give the
hiſtory of a bird that, from the ſingularity of its conformation, ſeems
allied to no ſpecies; and ſhould therefore be ſeparately deſcribed. I
mean the Pelican.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the Pelican.</head>
                  <p>THE Pelican of Africa is much larger in the body than a
ſwan, and ſomewhat of the ſame ſhape and colour. Its four toes are all
webbed together; and its neck in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of a
ſwan: but that ſingularity in which it differs from all other birds is in
the bill and the great pouch underneath, which are wonderful, and demand a
diſtinct deſcription. This enormous bill is fifteen inches from the point
to the opening of the mouth, which is a good way back behind the eyes. At the
baſe the bill is ſomewhat greeniſh, but varies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end, being of
a reddiſh blue. It is very thick in the beginning, but tapers off to the end,
where it hooks downwards. The under-chap is ſtill more extraordinary; for to
the lower edges of it hang a bag, reaching the whole length of the bill to the
neck, which is ſaid to be capable of containing fifteen quarts of water. This
bag the bird has a power of wrinkling up into the hollow of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chap; but
by opening the bill, and putting <pb facs="tcp:0823900106:58"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0823900106:59"/>

                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0823900106:60"/> one's hand
down into the bag, it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended at pleaſure. The ſkin of which it
is formed will then be ſeen of a bluiſh aſh-colour, with many fibres and
veins running over its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. It is not covered with feathers, but a
ſhort downy ſubſtance as ſmooth and as ſoft as ſatin, and is
attached all along the under edges of the chap, to be fixed backward to the
neck of the bird by proper ligaments, and reaches near half way down. When this
bag is empty it is not ſeen; but when the bird has fiſhed with ſucceſs,
it is then incredible to what an extent it is often ſeen dilated. For the
firſt thing the pelican does in fiſhing is to fill up the bag; and then it
returns to digeſt its burthen at leiſure. When the bill is opened to its
wideſt extent, a perſon may run his head into the bird's mouth, and conceal
it in this monſtrous pouch, thus adapted for very ſingular purpoſes. Yet
this is nothing to what Ruyſch aſſures us, who avers that a man has been
ſeen to hide his whole leg, boot and all, in the monſtrous jaws of one of
theſe animals. At firſt appearance this would ſeem impoſſible, as the
ſides of the under chap, from which the bag depends, are not above an inch
aſunder when the bird's bill is firſt opened; but then they are capable of
great ſeparation; and it muſt neceſſarily be ſo <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0823900106:61"/>
as the bird preys upon the largeſt fiſhes, and hides them by dozens in its
pouch. Tertre affirms that it will hide as many fiſh as will ſerve ſixty
hungry men for a meal.</p>
                  <p>Such is the formation of this extraordinary bird, which is a
native of Africa and America. The pelican was once alſo known in Europe,
particularly in Ruſſia; but it ſeems to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted our coaſts.
This is the bird of which ſo many fabulous accounts have been propagated;
ſuch as its feeding its young with its own blood, and its carrying a
proviſion of water for them in its great reſervoir in the deſart. But the
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of the firſt account anſwers itſelf; and as for the latter,
the pelican uſes its bag for very different purpoſes than that of filling
it with water.</p>
                  <p>Its amazing pouch may be conſidered as ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to the
crop in other birds, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that as theirs lies at the bottom
of the gullet, ſo this is placed at the top. Thus, as pigeons and other birds
macerate their food for their young in their crops, and then ſupply them,
ſo the pelican ſupplies its young by a more ready contrivance, and
macerates their food in its bill, or ſtores it for its own particular
ſuſtenance.</p>
                  <p>The ancients were particularly fond of giving 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0823900106:62"/> this bird admirable qualities and parental af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
ſtruck, perhaps, with its extraordinary figure, they were willing to ſupply
it with as extraordinary appetites; and having found it with a large
reſervoir, they were pleaſed with turning it to the moſt tender and
parental uſes. But the truth is, the pelican is a very heavy, ſluggiſh,
voracious bird, and very ill fitted to take thoſe flights, or to make thoſe
cautious proviſions for a diſtant time, which we have been told they do.
Father Labat, who ſeems to have ſtudied their manners with great
exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, has given us a minute hiſtory of this bird, as found in
America; and from him I will borrow mine.</p>
                  <p>The pelican, ſays Labat, has ſtrong wings, furniſhed
with thick plumage of an aſh-colour, as are the reſt of the feathers over
the whole body. Its eyes are very ſmall, when compared to the ſize of its
head; there is a ſadneſs in its countenance, and its whole air is
melancholly. It is as dull and reluctant in its motions, as the flamingo is
ſprightly and active. It is ſlow of flight; and when it riſes to fly,
performs it with difficulty and labour. Nothing, as it would ſeem, but the
ſpur of neceſſity, could make theſe birds change their ſituation, or
induce them to aſcend into the air: but they muſt either ſtarve or
fly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0823900106:63"/>They are torpid and inactive to the laſt
degree, ſo that nothing can exceed their indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence but their gluttony; it is
only from the ſtimulations of hunger that they are excited to labour; for
otherwiſe they would continue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in fixed repoſe. When they have
raiſed themſelves about thirty or forty feet above the ſurface of the
ſea, they turn their head with one eye downwards, and continue to fly in that
poſture. As ſoon as they perceive a fiſh ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently near the
ſurface, they dart down upon it with the ſwiftneſs of an arrow, ſeize
it with unerring certainty, and ſtore it up in their pouch. They then riſe
again, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great labour, and continue hovering and fiſhing,
with their head on one ſide as before.</p>
                  <p>This work they continue with great effort and induſtry till
their bag is full, and then they fly to land to devour and digeſt at
leiſure the fruits of their induſtry. This, however, it would appear they
are not long performing; for towards night they have another hungry call; and
they again reluctantly go to labour. At night, when their fiſhing is over,
and the toil of the day crowned with ſucceſs, theſe lazy birds retire a
little way from the ſhore; and, though with the webbed feet and clumſy
figure of a gooſe, they will be contented to perch no where but upon trees 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0823900106:64"/> among the light and airy tenants of the foreſt. There
they take their repoſe for the night; and often ſpend a great part of the
day, except ſuch times as they are fiſhing, ſitting in diſmal
ſolemnity, and as it would ſeem half aſleep. Their attitude is, with the
head reſting upon their great bag, and that reſting upon their breaſt.
There they remain without motion, or once changing their ſituation, till the
calls of hunger break their repoſe, and till they find it indiſpenſibly
neceſſary to fill their magazine for a freſh meal. Thus their life is
ſpent between ſleeping and eating; and our author adds, that they are as
foul as they are voracious, as they are every moment voiding excrements in
heaps as large as one's fiſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſame indolent habits ſeem to attend them even in
preparing for incubation, and defending their young when excluded. The female
makes no preparation for her neſt, nor ſeems to chuſe any place in
preference to lay in; but drops her eggs on the bare ground to the number of
five or ſix, and there continues to hatch them. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the place,
without any deſire of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending her eggs or her young, ſhe tamely ſits
and ſuffers them to be taken from under her. Now and then ſhe juſt
ventures to peck, or to cry out when a perſon offers to beat her off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0823900106:65"/>She feeds her young with fiſh macerated
for ſome time in her bag; and when they cry flies off for a new ſupply.
Labat tells us that he took two of theſe when very young, and tied them by
the leg to a poſt ſtuck into the ground, where he had the pleaſure of
ſeeing the old one for ſeveral days come to feed them, remaining with them
the greateſt part of the day, and ſpending the night on the branch of a
tree that hung over them. By theſe means they were all three become ſo
familiar, that they ſuffered themſelves to be handled; and the young ones
very kindly accepted whatever fiſh he offered them. Theſe they always put
firſt into their bag, and then ſwallowed at their leiſure.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems, however, that they are but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable and
uſeleſs domeſtics; their gluttony can ſcarcely be ſatisfied; their
fleſh ſmells very rancid; and taſtes a thouſand times worſe than it
ſmells. The native Americans kill vaſt numbers; not to eat, for they are
not fit even for the banquet of a ſavage; but to convert their large bags
into purſes and tobacco-pouches. They beſtow no ſmall pains in
dreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſkin with ſalt and aſhes, rubbing it well with oil, and
then forming it to their purpoſe. It thus becomes ſo ſoft and pliant,
that the Spaniſh women ſometimes adorn it <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0823900106:66"/> with gold
and embroidery to make work-bags of.</p>
                  <p>Yet, with all the ſeeming hebetude of this bird, it is not
entirely incapable of inſtruction in a domeſtic ſtate. Father Raymond
aſſures us, that he has ſeen one ſo tame and well edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated among the
native Americans, that it would go off in the morning at the word of command,
and return before night to its maſter, with its great paunch diſtended with
plunder; a part of which the ſavages would make it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge, and a part
they would permit it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for itſelf.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <q rend="inline">"The Pelican," as Faber relates, "is not
deſtitute of other qualifications. One of thoſe which was brought alive to
the Duke of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia's court, where it lived forty years, ſeemed to be
poſſeſſed of very uncommon ſenſations. It was much delighted in the
company and converſation of men, and in muſic both vocal and
inſtrumental; for it would willingly ſtand," ſays he, "by thoſe that
ſung or ſounded the trumpet; and ſtretching out its head, and turning its
ear to the muſic, liſtened very attentively to its harmony, though its own
voice was little pleaſanter than the braying of an aſs."</q> Geſner tells
us that the emperor Maximilian had a tame pelican <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0823900106:67"/> which
lived for above eighty years, and that always attended his army on their march.
It was one of the largeſt of the kind, and had a daily allowance by the
emperor's orders. As another proof of the great age to which the pelican lives,
Aldrovandus makes mention of one of theſe birds that was kept ſeveral years
at Mechlin, and was verily believed to be fifty years old.—We often ſee
theſe birds at our ſhews about town.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the Albatroſs, the firſt of the Gull
Kind.</head>
                  <p>THOUGH this is one of the largeſt and moſt formidable
birds of Africa and America, yet we have but few accounts to enlighten us in
its hiſtory. The figure of the bird is thus deſcribed by Edwards. 
<q rend="inline">"The body is rather larger than that of the
pelican; and its wings when extended ten feet from tip to tip. The bill, which
is ſix inches long, is yellowiſh, and terminates in a crooked point. The
top of the head is of a bright brown; the back is of a dirty deep ſpotted
brown; and the belly and under the wings is white; the toes, which are webbed,
are of a fleſh colour."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such are the principal traits in this bird's figure: but
theſe lead us a very ſhort way in its hiſtory; and our naturaliſts have
thought fit to ſay nothing more. However, I am apt to believe this bird to be
the ſame with that deſcribed by Wicquefort, under the title of the
Alcatraz; its ſize, its colours, and its prey incline me to think ſo. He
deſcribes it as a kind of great gull, as large in the body as a 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0823900106:69"/> gooſe, of a brown colour, with a long bill, and living
upon fiſh, of which they kill great numbers.</p>
                  <p>This bird is an inhabitant of the tropical cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and
alſo beyond them as far as the Streights of Magellan in the South Seas. It is
one of the moſt fierce and formidable of the aquatic tribe, not only living
upon fiſh, but alſo ſuch ſmall water-fowl as it can take by ſurprize.
It preys, as all the gull-kind do, upon the wing; and chiefly purſues the
flying-fiſh, that are forced from the ſea by the dolphins. The ocean in
that part of the world preſents a very different appearance from the ſeas
with which we are ſurrounded. In our ſeas we ſee nothing but a dreary
expanſe, ruffled by winds, and ſeemingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by every claſs of
animated nature. But the tropical ſeas, and the diſtant ſouthern
lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes beyond them, are all alive with birds and fiſhes, purſuing and
purſued. Every various ſpecies of the gull-kind are there ſeen hovering
on the wing, at a thouſand miles diſtance from the ſhore. The flying
fiſh are every moment riſing to eſcape from their purſuers of the deep,
only to encounter equal dangers in the air. Juſt as they riſe the dolphin
is ſeen to dart after them, but generally in vain; the gull has more frequent
ſucceſs, and often takes them at their <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0823900106:70"/> riſe; while
the albatroſs purſues the gull, and obliges it to relinquiſh its prey:
ſo that the whole horizon preſents but one living picture of rapacity and
evaſion.</p>
                  <p>So much is certain; but how far we are to credit Wicquefort,
in what he adds concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this bird, the reader is left to determine 
<q rend="inline">"As theſe birds, except when they breed,
live entirely remote from land, ſo they are often ſeen, as it ſhould
ſeem, ſleeping in the air. At night, when they are preſſed by
ſlumber, they riſe into the clouds as high as they can; there, putting
their head under one wing, they beat the air with the other, and ſeem to take
their eaſe. After a time, however, the weight of their bodies, only thus half
ſupported, brings them down; and they are ſeen deſcending, with a pretty
rapid motion, to the ſurface of the ſea. Upon this they again put forth
their efforts to riſe; and thus alternately aſcend and deſcend at their
eaſe. But it ſometimes happens," ſays my author, "that, in theſe
ſlumbering flights, they are off their guard, and fall upon deck, where they
are taken."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What truth there may be in this account, I will not take it
upon me to determine; but certain it is, that few birds float upon the air 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0823900106:71"/> with more eaſe than the albatroſs, or ſupport
themſelves a longer time in that element. They ſeem never to feel the
acceſſes of fatigue; but night and day upon the wing are always prowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet always emaciated and hungry.</p>
                  <p>But though this bird be one of the moſt formidable tyrants
of the deep, there are ſome aſſociations which even tyrants themſelves
form, to which they are induced either by caprice or neceſſity. The
albatroſs ſeems to have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar affection for the penguin, and a
pleaſure in its ſociety. They are always ſeen to chuſe the ſame
places for breeding; ſome diſtant, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited iſland, where the ground
ſlants to the ſea, as the penguin is not formed either for flying or
climbing. In ſuch places their neſts are ſeen together, as if they
ſtood in need of mutual aſſiſtance and protection. Captain Hunt, who
for ſome time commanded at our ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Falkland Iſlands,
aſſures me, that he was often amazed at the union preſerved between
theſe birds, and the regularity with which they built together. In that bleak
and deſolate ſpot, where the birds had long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued undiſturbed
poſſeſſors, and no way dreaded the encroachments of men, they ſeemed
to make their abode as comfortable as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it to be laſting. They
were ſeen to <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0823900106:72"/> build with an amazing degree of uniformity;
their neſts covering fields by thouſands, and reſembling a regular
plantation. In the middle, on high, the albatroſs raiſed its neſt, on
heath ſticks and long graſs, about two feet above the ſurface: round this
the penguins made their lower ſettlements, rather in holes in the ground; and
moſt uſually eight penguins to one alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs. Nothing is a ſtronger
proof of Mr. Buffon's fine obſervation, that the preſence of man not only
deſtroys the ſociety of meaner animals, but their inſtincts alſo.

                  <head>CHAP. IV. The Cormorant.</head>
                  <p>THE Cormorant is about the ſize of a large Muſcovy duck,
and may be diſtinguiſhed from all other birds of this kind, by its four
toes being united by membranes together; and by the middle toe being toothed or
notched, like a ſaw, to aſſiſt it in holding its fiſhy prey. The head
and neck of this bird are of a ſooty blackneſs; and the body thick and
heavy, more inclining in figure to that of the gooſe than the gull. The bill
is ſtraight, till near the end, where the upper chap bends into a hook.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the ſeeming heavineſs of its make,
there are few birds more powerfully predaceous. As ſoon as the winter
approaches, they are ſeen diſperſed along the ſea-ſhore, and
aſcending up the mouths of freſh-water rivers, carrying deſtruction to
all the finny tribe. They are moſt remarkably voracious, and have a moſt
ſudden digeſtion. Their appetite is for ever craving, and never
ſatisfied. This gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſation may probably be encreaſed by the
great quantity of ſmall worms that fill their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, and which their
unceaſing gluttony contributes to engender.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0823900106:74"/>Thus formed with the groſſeſt
appetites, this unclean bird has the moſt rank and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſmell,
and is more foetid than even car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, when in its moſt healthful ſtate.
Its form, ſays an ingenious modern, is diſagreeable; its voice is hoarſe
and croaking; and all its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities obſcene. No wonder then that Milton
ſhould make Satan perſonate this bird, when he ſent him upon the
baſeſt purpoſes, to ſurvey with pain the beauties of Paradiſe, and to
ſit deviſing death on the tree of life<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <bibl>Vide
Penant's Zoology, p. 477.</bibl>
                     </note>. It has been remarked, however, of our
poet, that the making a water-fowl perch on a tree, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied no great
acquaintance with the hiſtory of nature. In vindication of Milton,
Ariſtotle expreſsly ſays, that the cormorant is the only water-fowl that
ſits on trees. We have already ſeen the pelican of this number; and the
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant's toes ſeem as fit for perching upon trees as for ſwimming; ſo
that our epic bard ſeems to have been as deeply verſed in natural hiſtory
as in criticiſm.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, this bird ſeems to be of a multiform nature; and
wherever fiſh are to be found, watches their migrations. It is ſeen as well
by land as ſea; it fiſhes in freſh-water lakes, as well as in the depths
of the ocean; it builds <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0823900106:75"/> in the cliffs of rocks, as well as
on trees; and preys not only in the day-time, but by night.</p>
                  <p>Its indefatigable nature, and its great power in catching
fiſh, were probably the motives that induced ſome nations to breed this
bird up tame, for the purpoſes of fiſhing; and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby aſſures us,
it was once uſed in England for that purpoſe. The deſcription of their
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fiſhing is thus delivered by Faber. 
<q rend="inline">"When they carry them out of the rooms where
they are kept, to the fiſh-pools, they hood-wink them, that they may not be
fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the way. When they are come to the rivers, they take off their
hoods; and having tied a leather thong round the lower part of their necks,
that they may not ſwallow down the fiſh they catch, they throw them into
the river. They preſently dive under water; and there, for a long time, with
wonderful ſwiftneſs, purſue the fiſh; and when they have caught them,
riſe to the top of the water, and preſſing the fiſh lightly with their
bills, ſwallow them; till each bird hath, after this manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured five
or ſix fiſhes. Then their keepers call them to the fiſt, to which they
readily fly; and, one after another, vomit up all their fiſh, a little
bruiſed with the firſt nip <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0823900106:76"/> given in catching them.
When they have done fiſhing, ſetting the birds on ſome high place, they
looſe the ſtring from their necks, leaving the paſſage to the ſtomach
free and open; and, for their reward, they throw them part of their prey; to
each one or two fiſhes, which they will catch moſt dexterouſly, as they
are falling in the air."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At preſent, the cormorant is trained up in every part of
China for the ſame purpoſe, where there are many lakes and canals. 
<q rend="inline">"To this end," ſays Le Comte, "they are
educated as men rear up ſpaniels or hawks; and one man can eaſily manage an
hundred. The fiſher carries them out into the lake, perched on the gunnel of
his boat, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue tranquil, and expecting his orders with
patience. When arrived at the proper place, at the firſt ſignal given each
flies a different way, to fulfil the taſk aſſigned it. It is very
pleaſant, on this occaſion, to behold with what ſagacity they portion out
the lake or the canal where they are upon duty. They hunt about, they plunge,
they riſe an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times to the ſurface, until they have at laſt found
their prey. They then ſeize it with their beak by the middle, and carry it
without fail to their maſter. When the fiſh <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0823900106:77"/> is too
large, they then give each other mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual aſſiſtance: one ſeizes it by
the head, the other by the tail, and in this manner carry it to the boat
together. There the boat-man ſtretches out one of his long oars, on which
they perch, and being delivered of their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, they fly off to purſue
their ſport. When they are wearied, he lets them reſt for a while; but they
are never fed till their work is over. In this manner they ſupply a very
plentiful table; but ſtill their natural gluttony cannot be reclaimed even by
education. They have always, while they fiſh, the ſame ſtring faſtened
round their throats, to prevent them from devouring their prey, as otherwiſe
they would at once ſatiate themſelves, and diſcontinue their purſuit
the moment they had filled their bellies."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the reſt, the cormorant is the beſt fiſher of all
birds; and though fat and heavy with the quantity it devours, is nevertheleſs
generally upon the wing. The great activity with which it purſues, and from a
vaſt height drops down to dive after its prey, offers one of the moſt
amuſing ſpectacles to thoſe who ſtand upon a cliff on the ſhore. This
large bird is ſeldom ſeen in the air, but where there are fiſh below; but
then they muſt be near the <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0823900106:78"/> ſurface, before it will
venture to ſouſe upon them. If they are at a depth beyond what the impetus
of its flight makes the cormorant ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diving to, they certainly
eſcape him; for this bird cannot move ſo faſt under water, as the fiſh
can ſwim. It ſeldom, however, makes an unſucceſsful dip; and is often
ſeen riſing heavily, with a fiſh larger than it can readily devour. It
ſometimes alſo happens, that the cormorant has caught the fiſh by the
tail; and conſequently the fins prevent its being eaſily ſwallowed in
that poſition. In this caſe, the bird is ſeen to toſs its prey above
its head, and very deterouſly to catch it, when deſcending, by the proper
end, and ſo ſwallow it with eaſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of the Gannet or Soland Gooſe.</head>
                  <p>THE Gannet is of the ſize of a tame gooſe, but its wings
much longer, being ſix feet over. The bill is ſix inches long, ſtraight
almoſt to the point, where it inclines down, and the ſides are irregularly
jagged, that it may hold its prey with greater ſecurity. It differs from the
cormorant in ſize, being larger; in its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which is chiefly white; and
by its having no noſtrils, but in their place a long furrow that reaches
almoſt to the end of the bill. From the corner of the mouth is a narrow
ſlip of black bare ſkin, that extends to the hind part of the head; beneath
the ſkin is another that, like the pouch of the pelican, is dilatable, and of
ſize ſufficient to contain five or ſix entire herrings, which in the
breeding ſeaſon it carries at once to its mate or its young.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds, which ſubſiſt entirely upon fiſh,
chiefly reſort to thoſe uninhabited iſlands where their food is found in
plenty, and men ſeldom come to diſturb them. The iſlands to the north of
Scotland, the Skelig iſlands of the coaſts of Kerry, in Ireland, and
thoſe <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0823900106:80"/> that lie in the north ſea off Norway, abound
with them. But it is on the Baſs iſland, in the Firth of Edinburgh, where
they are ſeen in the greateſt abundance. 
<q rend="inline">"There is a ſmall iſland," ſays the
celebrated Harvey, "called the Baſs, not more than a mile in circumference.
The ſurface is almoſt wholly covered during the months of May and June with
their neſts, their eggs and young. It is ſcarcely poſſible to walk
without treading on them: the flocks of birds upon the wing, are ſo numerous,
as to darken the air like a cloud; and their noiſe is ſuch, that one
cannot, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, be heard by the perſon next to him. When one
looks down upon the ſea from the precipice, its whole ſurface ſeems
covered with infinite numbers of birds of different kinds, ſwimming and
purſuing their prey. If, in ſailing round the iſland, one ſurveys its
hanging cliffs, in every crag or fiſſure of the broken rocks, may be ſeen
innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable birds, of various ſorts and ſizes, more than the ſtars of
heaven, when viewed in a ſerene night. If they are viewed at a diſtance,
either receding, or in their approach to the iſland, they ſeem like one
vaſt ſwarm of bees."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are not leſs frequent upon the rocks 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0823900106:81"/> of St. Kilda. Martin aſſures us, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of that ſmall iſland conſume annually near twenty-three thouſand young
birds of this ſpecies, beſides an amazing quantity of their eggs. On
theſe they principally ſubſiſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the year; and from the
number of theſe viſitants, make an eſtimate of their plenty for the
ſeaſon. They preſerve both the eggs and fowls in ſmall pyramidal
ſtone buildings, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them with turf-aſhes, to prevent the evaporation
of their moiſture.</p>
                  <p>The gannet is a bird of paſſage. In winter it ſeeks the
more ſouthern coaſts of Cornwall, hovering over the ſhoals of herrings
and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards that then come down from the northern ſeas: its firſt
appearance in the northern iſlands, is in the beginning of ſpring; and it
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to breed till the end of ſummer. But, in general, its motions are
determined by the migrations of the immenſe ſhoals of herrings that come
pouring down at that ſeaſon through the Britiſh Channel, and ſupply all
Europe as well as this bird with their ſpoil. The gannet aſſiduouſly
attends the ſhoal in their paſſage, keeps with them in their whole
circuit round our iſland, and ſhares with our fiſhermen this
exhauſtleſs banquet. As it is ſtrong of wing, it never comes near the
land; but is conſtant <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0823900106:82"/> to its prey. Wherever the gannet
is ſeen, it is ſure to announce to the fiſhermen the arrival of the finny
tribe; they then prepare their nets, and take the herrings by millions at a
draught; while the gannet, who came to give the firſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, comes,
though an unbidden gueſt, and often ſnatches its prey from the fiſherman
even in his boat. While the fiſhing ſeaſon continues, the gannets are
buſily employed; but when the pilchards diſappear from our coaſts, the
gannet takes its leave, to keep them company.</p>
                  <p>The cormorant has been remarked for the quickneſs of his
ſight; yet in this the gannet ſeems to exceed him. It is poſſeſſed
of a tranſparent membrane under the eye-lid, with which it covers the whole
eye at pleaſure, without obſcuring the ſight in the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
This ſeems a neceſſary proviſion for the ſecurity of the eyes of ſo
weighty a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe method of taking prey, like that of the cormorant,
is by darting headlong down from an height of an hundred feet and more into the
water to ſeize it. Theſe birds are ſometimes taken at ſea, by
faſtening a pilchard to a board, which they leave floating. The gannet
inſtantly pounces down from above upon the board, and is killed or maimed by
the ſhock of a body where it expected no reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0823900106:83"/>Theſe birds breed but once a year, and
lay but one egg, which being taken away, they lay another; if that is alſo
taken, then a third; but never more for that ſeaſon. Their egg is white,
and rather leſs than that of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gooſe; and their neſt large,
compoſed of ſuch ſubſtances as are found floating on the ſurface of
the ſea. The young birds, during the firſt year, differ greatly in colour
from the old ones; being of a duſky hue, ſpeckled with numerous triangular
white ſpots; and at that time reſembling the colours of the ſpeckled
diver.</p>
                  <p>The Baſs Iſland, where they chiefly breed, belongs to one
proprietor; ſo that care is taken never to fright away the birds when laying,
or to ſhoot them upon the wing. By that means, they are ſo confident as to
alight and feed their young ones cloſe beſide you. They feed only upon
fiſh, as was obſerved; yet the young gannet is counted a great dainty by
the Scots, and ſold very dear; ſo that the lord of the iſlet makes a
conſiderable annual profit by the ſale.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of ſmaller Gulls and Petrels.</head>
                  <p>HAVING deſcribed the manners of the great ones of this
tribe, thoſe of the ſmaller kinds may be eaſily inferred. They reſemble
the more powerful in their appetites for prey, but have not ſuch certain
methods of obtaining it. In general, therefore, the induſtry of this tribe
and their audacity encreaſe in proportion to their imbecility; the great
gulls live at the moſt remote diſtance from man; the ſmaller are obliged
to reſide wherever they can take their prey; and to come into the moſt
populous places when ſolitude can no longer grant them a ſupply. In this
claſs we may place the Gull, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, of which there are above
twenty different kinds; the Petrel, of which there are three; and the Sea
ſwallow, of which there are as many. The gulls may be diſtinguiſhed by an
angular knob on the lower-chap; the petrels by their wanting this knob; and the
ſea-ſwallow, by their bills, which are ſtraight, ſlender, and ſharp
pointed. They all, however, agree in their appetites and their places of
abode.</p>
                  <p>The gull, and all its varieties, is very well 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0823900106:85"/> known in every part of the kingdom. It is ſeen with a
ſlow-ſailing flight hovering over rivers to prey upon the ſmaller kinds
of fiſh; it is ſeen following the plowman in fallow fields to pick up
inſects; and when living animal food does not offer, it has even been known
to eat car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion and whatever elſe of the kind that offers. Gulls are found in
great plenty in every place; but it is chiefly round our boldeſt rockieſt
ſhores that they are ſeen in the greateſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; it is there that
the gull breeds and brings up its young; it is there that millions of them are
heard ſcreaming with diſcordant notes for months together.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who have been much upon our coaſts know that there
are two different kinds of ſhores; that which ſlants down to the water with
a gentle declivity, and that which riſes with a precipitate boldneſs, and
ſeems ſet as a bulwark to repel the force of the invading deeps. It is to
ſuch ſhores as theſe that the whole tribe of the gull-kind reſort, as
the rocks offer them a retreat for their young, and the ſea a ſufficient
ſupply. It is in the cavities of theſe rocks, of which the ſhore is
compoſed, that the vaſt variety of ſea-fowls retire to breed in fafety.
The waves beneath, that continually beat at the baſe, often wear 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0823900106:86"/> the ſhore into an impending boldneſs; ſo that it
ſeems to jut out over the water, while the raging of the ſea makes the
place inacceſſible from below. Theſe are the ſituations to which
ſea-fowl chiefly reſort, and bring up their young in undiſturbed
ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who have never obſerved our boldeſt coaſts have
no idea of their tremendous ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. The boaſted works of art, the
higheſt towers, and the nobleſt domes, are but ant-hills when put in
compariſon: the ſingle cavity of a rock often exhibits a coping higher than
the cieling of a gothic cathedral. The face of the ſhore offers to the view a
wall of maſſive ſtone ten times higher than our talleſt ſteeples.
What ſhould we think of a precipice three quarters of a mile in height; and
yet the rocks of St. Kilda are ſtill higher! What muſt be our awe to
approach the edge of that impending height, and to look down on the
unfathomable vacuity below; to ponder on the terrors of falling to the bottom,
where the waves that ſwell like moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are ſcarcely ſeen to curl on
the ſurface, and the roar of an ocean a thouſand leagues broad appears
ſofter than the murmur of a brook! It is in theſe formidable manſions
that myriads of ſea-fowls are for ever ſeen ſporting, flying in
ſecurity down the depth, half a mile <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0823900106:87"/> beneath the feet of
the ſpectator. The crow and the chough avoid thoſe frightful preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices;
they chuſe ſmaller heights, where they are leſs expoſed to the
tempeſt; it is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant, the gannet, the tarrock, and the terne, that
venture to theſe dreadful retreats, and claim an undiſturbed
poſſeſſion. To the ſpectator from above, thoſe birds, though ſome
of them are above the ſize of an eagle, ſeem ſcarce as large as a
ſwallow; and their loudeſt ſcreaming is ſcarce perceptible.</p>
                  <p>But the generality of our ſhores are not ſo formidable.
Though they may riſe two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fathom above the ſurface, yet it often
happens that the water forſakes the ſhore at the departure of the tide, and
leaves a noble and delightful walk for curioſity on the beach. Not to mention
the variety of ſhells with which the ſand is ſtrewed, the lofty rocks
that hang over the ſpectator's head, and that ſeem but juſt kept from
falling, produce in him no unpleaſing gloom. If to this be added the
fluttering, the ſcreaming, and the purſuits of myriads of water-birds, all
either intent on the duties of incubation, or rouzed at the preſence of a
ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nothing can compoſe a ſcene of more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſolemnity. To
walk along the ſhore when the tide is departed, or to ſit in the hollow 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0823900106:88"/> of a rock when it is come in, attentive to the various
ſounds that gather on every ſide, above and below, may raiſe the mind to
its higheſt and nobleſt exertions. The ſolemn roar of the waves
ſwelling into and ſubſiding from the vaſt caverns beneath, the piercing
note of the gull, the frequent chatter of the guillemot, the loud note of the
auk, the ſcream of the heron, and the hoarſe deep periodical croaking of
the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant, all unite to furniſh out the grandeur of the ſcene, and
turn the mind to him who is the Eſſence of all ſublimity.</p>
                  <p>Yet it often happens that the contemplation of a ſea-ſhore
produces ideas of an humbler kind, yet ſtill not unpleaſing. The various
arts of theſe birds to ſeize their prey, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to elude their
purſuers, their ſociety among each other, and their tenderneſs and care
of their young, produce gentler ſenſations. It is ridiculous alſo now and
then to ſee their various ways of impoſing upon each other. It is common
enough, for inſtance, with the arctic gull, to purſue the leſſer gulls
ſo long, that they drop their excrements through fear, which the hungry
hunter quickly gobbles up before it ever reaches the water. In breeding too
they have frequent conteſts: one bird who has no neſt of her own attempts
to diſpoſſeſs another, <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0823900106:89"/> and put herſelf in the
place. This often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens among all the gull-kind; and I have ſeen the poor
bird, thus diſplaced by her more powerful invader, ſit near the neſt in
penſive diſcontent, while the other ſeemed quite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in her new
habitation. Yet this place of pre-eminence is not eaſily obtained; for the
inſtant the invader goes to ſnatch a moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary ſuſtenance, the other
enters upon her own, and always ventures another battle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe
relinquiſhes the juſtneſs of her claim. The contemplation of a cliff thus
covered with hatching-birds affords a very agreeable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; and as
they ſit upon the ledges of the rocks, one above another, with their white
breaſts forward, the whole groupe has not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptly been compared to an
apothecary's ſhop.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds, like all others of the rapacious kind, lay but
few eggs; and hence, in many places, their number is daily ſeen to
diminiſh. The leſſening of ſo many rapacious birds may, at firſt
ſight, appear a benefit to mankind; but when we conſider how many of the
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of our iſlands are ſuſtained by their fleſh, either freſh or
ſalted, we ſhall find no ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thinking that thoſe poor
people may in time loſe their chief ſupport. The gull in general, as was
ſaid, builds on the ledges of <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0823900106:90"/> rocks, and lays from one
egg to three, in a neſt formed of long graſs and ſea-weed. Moſt of the
kind are fiſhy taſted, with black ſtringy fleſh; yet the young ones are
better food: and of theſe, with ſeveral other birds of the penguin kind,
the poor inhabitants of our northern iſlands make their wretched ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.
They have been long uſed to no other food; and even ſalted gull can be
reliſhed by thoſe who know no better. Almoſt all delicacy is a relative
thing; and the man who repines at the luxuries of a well-ſerved table,
ſtarves not for want but from compariſon. The luxuries of the poor are
indeed coarſe to us, yet ſtill they are luxuries to thoſe ignorant of
better; and it is probable enough that a Kilda or a Feroe man may be found to
exiſt, outdoing Apicius himſelf, in conſulting the pleaſures of the
table. Indeed, if it be true that ſuch meat as is the moſt dangerouſly
earned is the ſweeteſt, no men can dine ſo luxuriouſly as theſe, as
none venture ſo hardly in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of a dinner. In Jacobſon's
hiſtory of the Feroe Iſlands, we have an account of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in which
thoſe birds are taken; and I will deliver it in his own ſimple manner.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <q rend="inline">"It cannot be expreſſed with what pains
and danger they take theſe birds in thoſe high ſteep cliffs, whereof many
are two hundred fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0823900106:91"/> high. But there are men apt by
nature and fit for the work, who take them uſually in two manners: they
either climb from below into theſe high promontories, that are as ſteep as
a wall; or they let themſelves down with a rope from above. When they climb
from below, they have a pole five or ſix ells long, with an iron hook at the
end, which they that are below in the boat, or on the cliff, faſten unto the
man's girdle, helping him up thus to the higheſt place where he can get
footing: afterwards they alſo help up another man; and thus ſeveral climb
up as high as poſſibly they can; and where they find diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, they help
each other up, by thruſting one another up with their poles. When the firſt
hath taken footing, he draws the other up to him, by the rope faſtened to his
waſte; and ſo they proceed, till they come to the place where the birds
build. They there go about as well as they can, in thoſe dangerous places;
the one holding the rope at one end, and fixing himſelf to the rock; the
other going at the other end from place to place. If it ſhould happen that he
chanceth to fall, the other that ſtands firm keeps him up, and helps him up
again. But if he paſſeth ſafe, he likewiſe faſtens himſelf till the
other has <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0823900106:92"/> paſſed the ſame dangerous place alſo.
Thus they go about the cliffs after birds as they pleaſe. It often happeneth,
however, the more is the pity, that when one doth not ſtand faſt enough, or
is not ſufficiently ſtrong to hold up the other in his fall, that they both
fall down and are killed. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſome do periſh every

                  <p>Mr. Peter Clanſon, in his deſcription of Norway, writeth,
that there was antiently a law in that country, that whoſoever climbed ſo
on the cliffs, that he fell down and died, if the body was found, before
burial, his next kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould go the ſame way; but if he durſt not
or could not do it, the dead body was not then to be buried in ſanctified
earth, as the perſon was too full of temerity, and his own deſtroyer.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <q rend="inline">"When the fowlers are come, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
aforeſaid, to the birds within the cliffs, where people ſeldom come, the
birds are ſo tame that they take them with their hands; for they will not
readily leave their young. But when they are wild, they caſt a net, with
which they are provided, over them, and intangle them therein. In the mean
time, there lieth a boat beneath in the ſea, wherein they caſt the birds
killed; and in this manner they can, in a ſhort time, fill a 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0823900106:93"/> boat with fowl. When it is pretty fair weather, and there
is good fowling, the fowlers ſtay in the cliffs ſeven or eight days
together; for there are here and there holes in the rocks, where they can
ſafely reſt; and they have meat let down to them with a line from the top
of the mountain. In the mean time ſome go every day to them, to fetch home
what they have taken. 
<p> "Some rocks are ſo difficult, that they can in no
manner get unto them from below; wherefore they ſeek to come down thereunto
from above. For this purpoſe they have a rope, eighty or a hundred fathoms
long, made of hemp, and three fingers thick. The fowler maketh the end of this
faſt about his waiſt, and between his legs, ſo that he can ſit thereon;
and is thus let down, with the fowling ſtaff in his hand. Six men hold by the
rope, and let him eaſily down, laying a large piece of wood on the brink of
the rock, upon which the rope glideth, that it may not be worn to pieces by the
hard and rough edge of the ſtone. They have beſides, another ſmall line,
that is faſtened to the fowler's body; on which he pulleth, to give them
notice how they ſhould let down the great rope, either lower or higher; or to
hold ſtill, <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0823900106:94"/> that he may ſtay in the place whereunto he
is come. Here the man is in great danger, becauſe of the ſtones that are
looſened from the cliff, by the ſwinging of the rope, and he cannot avoid
them. To remedy this, in ſome meaſure, he hath uſually on his head a
ſeaman's thick and ſhaggy cap, which defends him from the blows of the
ſtones, if they be not too big; and then it coſteth him his life:
nevertheleſs, they continually put themſelves in that danger, for the
wretched body's food-ſake, hoping in God's mercy and protection, unto which
the greateſt part of them do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly recommend themſelves when they go to
work: otherwiſe, they ſay, there is no other great danger in it, except
that it is a toilſome and artificial labour; for he that hath not learned to
be ſo let down, and is not uſed thereto, is turned about with the rope,
ſo that he ſoon groweth giddy, and can do nothing; but he that hath learned
the art, conſiders it as a ſport, ſwings himſelf on the rope, ſets
his feet againſt the rock, caſts himſelf ſome fathoms from thence, and
ſhoots himſelf to what place he will: he knows where the birds are, he
undeſtands how to ſit on the line in the air, and how to hold the
fowling-ſtaff in his hand; ſtriking therewith <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0823900106:95"/> the
birds that come or fly away: and when there are holes in the rocks, and it
ſtretches itſelf out, making underneath as a cieling, under which the birds
are, he knoweth how to ſhoot himſelf in among them, and there take firm
footing. There, when he is in theſe holes, he maketh himſelf looſe of the
rope, which he faſtens to a crag of the rock, that it may not ſlip from him
to the outſide of the cliff. He then goes about in the rock, taking the fowl,
either with his hands or with the fowling-ſtaff. Thus, when he hath killed as
many birds as he thinks fit, he ties them in a bundle, and faſtens them to a
little rope, giving a ſign, by pulling, that they ſhould draw them up. When
he has wrought thus the whole day, and deſires to get up again, he ſitteth
once more upon the great rope, giving a new ſign, that they ſhould pull him
up; or elſe he worketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up, climbing along the rope, with his
girdle full of birds. It is alſo uſual, where there are not folks enough to
hold the great rope, for the fowler to drive a poſt ſloping into the earth,
and to make a rope faſt thereto, by which he lets himſelf down, without any
body's help, to work in the manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0823900106:96"/> Some
rocks are ſo formed that the perſon can go into their cavities by land.</p>

                        <p> "Theſe manners are more terrible and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to
ſee than to deſcribe; eſpecially if one conſiders the ſteepneſs and
height of the rocks, it ſeeming impoſſible for a man to approach them,
much leſs to climb or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend. In ſome places, the fowlers are ſeen
climbing where they can only faſten the ends of their toes and fingers; not
ſhunning ſuch places, though there be an hundred fathom between them and
the ſea. It is a dear meat for theſe poor people, for which they muſt
venture their lives; and many, after long venturing, do at laſt periſh
therein.</p> 
                        <p> "When the fowl is brought home, a part thereof is eaten
freſh; another part, when there is much taken, being hung up for winter
proviſion. The feathers are gathered, to make merchandize of, for other
expences. The inhabitants get a great many of theſe fowls, as God giveth his
bleſſing and fit wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When it is dark and hazy, they take moſt; for
then the birds ſtay in the rocks: but in clear weather, and hot
ſun-ſhine, they ſeek the ſea. When they prepare to depart for the
ſeaſon, they keep themſelves moſt there, ſitting on the clifts toward
the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0823900106:97"/> where people get at them ſometimes
with boats, and take them with fowling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaves."</p>

                  <p>Such is the account of this hiſtorian; but we are not to
ſuppoſe that all the birds caught in this manner, are of the gull kind: on
the contrary, numbers of them are of the penguin kind; auks, puffins and

                  <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Penguin Kind: and firſt of the Great
Magellanic Penguin.</head>
                  <p>THE gulls are long winged, ſwift flyers, that hover over the
moſt extenſive ſeas, and dart down upon ſuch fiſh as approach too
near the ſurface. The penguin kind are but ill fitted for flight, and ſtill
leſs for walking. Every body muſt have ſeen the aukward manner in which a
duck, either wild or tame, attempts to change place: they muſt recollect with
what ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and eaſe a gull or a kite waves its pinions, and with what
a coil and flutter the duck at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to move them; how many ſtrokes it is
obliged to give, in order to gather a little air; and even when it is thus
raiſed, how ſoon it is fatigued with the force of its exertions, and
obliged to take reſt again. But the duck is not, in its natural ſtate, half
ſo unweildy an animal as the whole tribe of the penguin kind. Their wings are
much ſhorter, more ſcantily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with quills, and the whole pinion
placed too forward, to be uſefully employed. For this reaſon, the largeſt
of the penguin kind, that have a thick, heavy body to raiſe, cannot 
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0823900106:99"/> fly at all. Their wings ſerve them rather as paddles to
help them forward, when they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to move ſwiftly; and in a manner walk
along the ſurface of the water. Even the ſmaller kinds ſeldom fly by
choice; they flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their wings with the ſwifteſt efforts without making
way; and though they have but a ſmall weight of body to ſuſtain, yet they
ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom venture to quit the water where they are provided with food and
protection.</p>
                  <p>As the wings of the penguin tribe are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted for flight,
their legs are ſtill more auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly adapted for walking. This whole tribe
have all above the knee hid within the belly; and nothing appears but two
ſhort legs, or feet, as ſome would call them, that ſeem ſtuck under the
rump, and upon which the animal is very aukwardly ſupported. They ſeem,
when ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or attempting to walk, like a dog that has been taught to ſit
up, or to move a minuet. Their ſhort legs drive the body in progreſſion
from ſide to ſide; and were they not aſſiſted by their wings, they
could ſcarcely move faſter than a tortoiſe.</p>
                  <p>This aukward poſition of the legs, which ſo unqualifies
them for living upon land, adapts them admirably for a reſidence in water. In
that, the legs placed behind the moving body, <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0823900106:100"/> puſhes it
forward with greater velocity; and theſe birds, like Indian canoes, are the
ſwifteſt in the water, by having their paddles in the rear. Our ſailors,
for this reaſon, give theſe birds the very homely, but expreſſive, name
of Arſe-feet.</p>
                  <p>Nor are they leſs qualified for diving than ſwimming. By
ever ſo little inclining their bodies forward, they loſe their center of
gravity; and every ſtroke from their feet only tends to ſink them the
faſter. In this manner they can either dive at once to the bottom, or ſwim
between two waters; where they continue fiſhing for ſome minutes, and then
aſcending, catch an inſtantaneous breath, to deſcend once more to renew
their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Hence it is that theſe birds, which are ſo
defenceleſs, and ſo eaſily taken by land, are impregnable by water. If
they perceive themſelves purſued in the leaſt, they inſtantly ſink,
and ſhew nothing more than their bills, till the enemy is withdrawn. Their
very internal conformation aſſiſts their power of keeping long under
water. Their lungs are fitted with numerous vacuities, by which they can take
in a very large inſpiration; and this probably ſerves them for a length of
time.</p>
                  <p>As they never viſit land, except when they 
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0823900106:101"/> come to breed, their feathers take a colour from their
ſituation. That part of them which has been continually bathed in the water,
is white; while their backs and wings are of different colours, according to
the different ſpecies. They are alſo covered more warmly all over the body
with feathers, than any other birds whatever; ſo that the ſea ſeems
entirely their element; and but for the neceſſary duties of propagating the
ſpecies, we ſhould ſcarcely have the ſmalleſt opportunity of ſeeing
them, and ſhould be utterly unacquainted with their hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Of all this tribe, the Magellanic Penguin is the largeſt,
and the moſt remarkable. In ſize it approaches near that of a tame gooſe.
It never flies, as its wings are very ſhort, and covered with ſtiff hard
feathers, and are always ſeen expanded, and hanging uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly down by the
bird's ſides. The upper part of the head, back and rump, are covered with
ſtiff, black feathers; while the belly and breaſt, as is common with all of
this kind, are of a ſnowy whiteneſs, except a line of black that is ſeen
to croſs the crop. The bill, which from the baſe to about half way is
covered with wrinkles, is black, but marked croſswiſe with a ſtripe of
yellow. They walk <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0823900106:102"/> erect with their heads on high, their
fin-like wings hanging down like arms; ſo that to ſee them at a diſtance,
they look like ſo many children with white aprons. From hence they are ſaid
to unite in themſelves the qualities of men, fowls and fiſhes. Like men,
they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; like fowls, they are feathered, and like fiſhes, they have
fin-like inſtruments, that beat the water before, and ſerve for all the
purpoſes of ſwimming rather than flying.</p>
                  <p>They feed upon fiſh; and ſeldom come aſhore, except in
the breeding-ſeaſon. As the ſeas in that part of the world abound with a
variety, they ſeldom want food; and their extreme fatneſs ſeems a proof
of the plenty in which they live. They dive with great rapidity, and are
voracious to a great degree. One of them, deſcribed by Cluſius, though but
very young, would ſwallow an entire herring at a mouthful, and often three
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively before it was appeaſed. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this
gluttonous appetite, their fleſh is rank and fiſhy; though our ſailors
ſay, that <hi>it is pretty good eating.</hi> In ſome the fleſh is ſo
tough, and the feathers ſo thick, that they ſtand the blow of a ſcymitar
without injury.</p>
                  <p>They are a bird of ſociety; and eſpecially when they come
on ſhore, they are ſeen drawn up <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0823900106:103"/> in rank and file,
upon the ledge of a rock, ſtanding together with the albatroſs, as if in
conſulation. This is previous to their lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which generally begins in
that part of the world in the month of November. Their preparations for laying
are attended with no great trouble, as a ſmall depreſſion in the earth,
without any other neſt, ſerves for this purpoſe. The warmth of their
feathers and the heat of their bodies is ſuch, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of
incubation is carried on very rapidly.</p>
                  <p>But there is a difference in the manner of this bird's
neſtling in other countries; which I can only aſcribe to the frequent
diſturbances it has received from man or quadrupedes in its receſſes. In
ſome places, inſtead of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf with a ſuperficial
depreſſion in the ground, the penguin is found to burrow two or three yards
deep: in other places it is ſeen to forſake the level, and to clamber up
the ledge of a rock, where it lays its egg, and hatches it in that bleak,
expoſed ſituation. Theſe precautions may probably have been taken, in
conſequence of dear bought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. In thoſe countries where the bird
fears for her own ſafety, or that of her young, ſhe may providentially
provide againſt danger, by digging, or even by climbing; for both which ſhe
is but ill adapted by nature. In thoſe places, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0823900106:104"/> however,
where the penguin has had but few viſits from man, her neſt is made, with
the moſt confident ſecurity, in the middle of ſome large plain, where
they are ſeen by thouſands. In that unguarded ſituation, neither
expecting nor fearing a powerful enemy, they continue to ſit brooding; and
even when man comes among them, have at firſt no apprehenſion of their
danger. Some of this tribe have been called, by our ſea-men, the Booby, from
the total inſenſibility which they ſhew when they are ſought to their
deſtruction. But it is not conſidered that theſe birds have never been
taught to know the dangers of an human enemy: it is againſt the fox or the
vulture that they have learned to defend themſelves; but they have no idea of
injury from a being ſo very unlike their natural oppoſers. The pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guins,
therefore, when our ſea-men firſt came among them, tamely ſuffered
themſelves to be knocked on the head, without even attempting an eſcape.
They have ſtood to be ſhot at in flocks, without offering to move, in
ſilent won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, till every one of their number has been deſtroyed. Their
attachment to their neſts was ſtill more powerful; for the females tamely
ſuffered the men to approach and take their eggs, without any reſiſtance.
But the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of a few of thoſe unfriendly viſits, has 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0823900106:105"/> long ſince taught them to be more upon their guard in
chuſing their ſituations; or to leave thoſe retreats where they were ſo
little able to oppoſe their invaders.</p>
                  <p>The penguin lays but one egg; and, in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented ſhores, is
found to burrow like a rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: ſometimes three or four take
poſſeſſion of one hole, and hatch their young together. In the holes of
the rocks, where Nature has made them a retreat, ſeveral of this tribe, as
Linnaeus aſſures us, are ſeen together. There the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males lay their
ſingle egg in a common neſt, and ſit upon this their general
poſſeſſion by turns; while one is placed as a centinel, to give warning
of approaching danger. The egg of the penguin, as well as of all this tribe, is
very large for the ſize of the bird, being generally found bigger than that
of a gooſe. But as there are many varieties of the penguin, and as they
differ in ſize, from that of a Muſcovy duck to a ſwan, the eggs differ in
the ſame proportion.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Auk, Puffin, and other Birds of the
Penguin Kind.</head>
                  <p>OF a ſize far inferior to the penguin, but with nearly the
ſame form, and exactly of the ſame appetites and manners, there is a very
nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous tribe. Theſe frequent our ſhores, and, like the penguin, have
their legs placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. They have ſhort wings, which are not totally
incapable of flight; with round bills for ſeizing their prey, which is
fiſh. They live upon the water, in which they are continually ſeen diving;
and ſeldom venture upon land, except for the purpoſes of continuing their
kind.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of this ſmaller tribe is the Great Northern
Diver, which is nearly of the ſize of a gooſe: it is beautifully variegated
all over with many ſtripes, and differs from the penguin, in being much
ſlenderer and more elegantly formed. The Grey Speckled Diver does not exceed
the ſize of a Muſcovy duck; and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſize, greatly reſembles the
former. The Auk, which breeds on the iſlands of St. Kilda, and chiefly
differs from the penguin <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0823900106:107"/> in ſize and colour. It is
ſmaller than a duck; and the whole of the breaſt and belly, as far as the
middle of the throat, is white. The Guillemot is about the ſame ſize; it
differs from the auk, in having a longer, a ſlenderer, and a ſtraighter
bill. The Scarlet Throated Diver may be diſtinguiſhed by its name; and the
Puffin or Coulterneb, is one of the moſt remarkable birds we know.</p>
                  <p>Words cannot eaſily deſcribe the form of the bill of the
puffin, which differs ſo greatly from that of any other bird. Thoſe who
have ſeen the coulter of a plough, may form ſome idea of the beak of this
odd-looking animal. The bill is flat; but, very different from that of the
duck, its edge is upwards. It is of a triangular figure, and ending in a
ſharp point; the upper chap bent a little downward, where it is joined to the
head: and a certain callous ſubſtance encompaſſing its baſe, as in
parrots. It is of two colours; aſh-coloured near the baſe, and red towards
the point. It has three fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows or groves impreſſed in it; one in the
livid part, two in the red. The eyes are fenced with a protuberant ſkin, of a
livid-colour; and they are grey or aſh-coloured. Theſe are marks
ſufficient to diſtinguiſh this bird by; but its <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0823900106:108"/>
value to thoſe in whoſe vicinity it breeds, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it ſtill more an
object of curioſity.</p>
                  <p>The puffin, like all the reſt of this kind, has its legs
thrown ſo far back, that it can hardly move without tumbling. This makes it
riſe with difficulty, and ſubject to many falls before it gets upon the
wing; but as it is a ſmall bird, not much bigger than a pigeon, when it once
riſes, it can continue its flight with great celerity.</p>
                  <p>Both this and all the former build no neſt; but lay their
eggs either in the crevices of rocks, or in holes under ground near the
ſhore. They chiefly chuſe the latter ſituation; for the puffin, the auk,
the guillemot, and the reſt, cannot eaſily riſe to the neſt when in a
lofty ſituation. Many are the attempts theſe birds are ſeen to make to
fly up to thoſe neſts which are ſo high above the ſurface. In
ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them inacceſſible to mankind, they often render them almoſt
inacceſſible to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They are frequently obliged to make three or
four efforts, before they can come at the place of incubation. For this
reaſon, the auk and guillemot, when they have once laid their ſingle egg,
which is extremely large for the ſize, ſeldom forſake it until it is
excluded. The male, who is better furniſhed for flight, <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0823900106:109"/> feeds the female during this interval; and ſo bare is the place
where ſhe ſits, that the egg would often roll down from the rock, did not
the body of the bird ſupport it.</p>
                  <p>But the puffin ſeldom chuſes theſe inacceſſible and
troubleſome heights for its ſituation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on its courage, and the
ſtrength of its bill, with which it bites moſt terribly, it either makes or
finds a hole in the ground, where to lay and bring forth its young. All the
winter theſe birds, like the reſt, are abſent; viſiting regions too
remote for diſcovery. At the latter end of March, or the beginning of April,
come over a troop of their ſpies or harbingers, that ſtay two or three
days, as it were to view and ſearch out for their former ſituations, and
ſee whether all be well. This done, they once more depart; and, about the
beginning of May, return again with the whole army of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. But if
the ſeaſon happens to be ſtormy and tempeſtuous, and the ſea
troubled, the unfortunate voyagers undergo incredible hardſhips; and they are
found, by hundreds, caſt away upon the ſhores, lean and periſhed with
famine<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Willoughby's Ornith. p.
326.</bibl>
                     </note>. It is moſt probable, therefore, that this voyage is
performed more on the water than in the air; and as they cannot fiſh 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0823900106:110"/> in ſtormy weather, their ſtrength is exhauſted
before they can arrive at their wiſhed-for harbour.</p>
                  <p>The puffin, when it prepares for breeding, which always
happens a few days after its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, begins to ſcrape up an hole in the
ground not far from the ſhore, and when it has ſome way penetrated the
earth, it then throws itſelf upon its back, and with bill and claws thus
burrows inward, till it has dug a hole with ſeveral windings and turnings,
from eight to ten feet deep. It particularly ſeeks to dig under a ſtone,
where it expects the greateſt ſecurity. In this fortified retreat it lays
one egg; which, though the bird be not much bigger than a pigeon, is of the
ſize of a hen.</p>
                  <p>When the young one's excluded, the parent's induſtry and
courage is incredible. Few birds or beaſts will venture to attack them in
their retreats. When the great ſea-raven, as Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobſon informs us, comes to
take away their young, the puffins boldly oppoſe him. Their meeting affords a
moſt ſingular combat. As ſoon as the raven approaches, the puffin catches
him under the throat with its beak, and ſticks its claws into his breaſt,
which makes the raven, with a loud ſcreaming, attempt to get away; but the
little bird ſtill holds faſt to the invader, <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0823900106:111"/> nor
lets him go till they both come to the ſea, where they drop down together,
and the raven is drowned: yet the raven is but too often ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; and
invading the puffin at the bottom of its hole, devours both the parent and its
family.</p>
                  <p>But were a puniſhment to be inflicted for immorality in
irrational animals, the puffin is juſtly a ſufferer from invaſion, as it
is often itſelf one of the moſt terrible invaders. Near the Iſle of
Angleſey, in an iſlet called Prieſholm, their flocks may be compared, for
multitude, to ſwarms of bees. In another iſlet, called the Calf of Man, a
bird of this kind, but of a different ſpecies, is ſeen in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
In both places, numbers of rabbits are found to breed; but the puffin,
unwilling to be at the trouble of making a hole, when there is one ready made,
diſpoſſeſſes the rabbits, and it is not unlikely deſtroys their
young. It is in theſe unjuſtly acquired retreats that the young puffins are
found in great numbers, and become a very valuable acquiſition to the natives
of the place. The old ones (I am now ſpeaking of the Manks puffin) early in
the morning, at break of day, leave their neſts and young, and even the
iſland, nor do they return till night-fall. All this time they are diligently
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0823900106:112"/> employed in fiſhing for their young; ſo that their
retreats on land, which in the morning were loud and clamorous, are now ſtill
and quiet, with not a wing ſtirring till the approach of duſk, when their
ſcreams once more announce their return. Whatever fiſh, or other food, they
have procured in the day, by night begins to ſuffer a kind of half
digeſtion, and is reduced to an oily matter, which is ejected from the
ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of the old ones into the mouth of the young. By this they are
nouriſhed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fat to an amazing degree. When they are arrived to
their full growth, they who are intruſted by the lord of the iſland, draw
them from their holes; and, that they may more readily keep an account of the
number they take, cut off one foot as a token. Their fleſh is ſaid to be
exceſſively rank, as they feed upon fiſh, eſpecially ſprats and
ſea-weed; however, when they are pickled and preſerved with ſpices, they
are admired by thoſe who are fond of high eating. We are told, that formerly
their fleſh was allowed by the church on Lenten days. They were, at that
time, alſo taken by ferrets, as we do rabbits. At preſent, they are either
dug out, or drawn out, from their burrows, with an hooked ſtick. They bite
extremely hard, and keep ſuch faſt hold of whatſoever 
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0823900106:113"/> they ſeize upon, as not to be eaſily diſengaged.
Their noiſe when taken is very diſagreeable, being like the efforts of a
dumb perſon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>The conſtant depredation, which theſe birds annually
ſuffer, does not in the leaſt ſeem to intimidate them, or drive them
away: on the contrary, as the people ſay, the neſt muſt be robbed, or the
old ones will breed there no longer. All birds of this kind lay but one egg;
yet if that be taken away, they will lay another, and ſo on to a third; which
ſeems to imply that robbing their neſts does not much intimidate them from
laying again. Thoſe, however, whoſe neſts have been thus deſtroyed, are
often too late in bringing up their young; who, if they be not fledged and
prepared for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration when all the reſt depart, are left at land to ſhift
for themſelves. In Auguſt the whole tribe is ſeen to take leave of their
ſummer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence; nor are they obſerved any more till the return of the
enſuing ſpring. It is probable that they ſail away to more ſouthern
regions, as our mariners frequently ſee myriads of water-fowl upon their
return, and ſteering uſually to the north. Indeed, the coldeſt countries
ſeem to be their moſt favoured retreats; and the number of water-fowl is
much greater in thoſe <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0823900106:114"/> colder climates, than in the
warmer regions, near the line. The quantity of oil which abounds in their
bodies, ſerves as a defence againſt cold, and preſerves them in vigour
againſt its ſeverity; but the ſame proviſion of oil is rather
detrimental in warm countries, as it turns rancid, and many of them die of
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which ariſe from its putrefaction. In general, however,
water-fowl can be properly ſaid to be of no climate; the element upon which
they live, being their proper reſidence. They neceſſarily ſpend a few
months of ſummer upon land, to bring up their young: but the reſt of their
time is probably conſumed in their migrations, or near ſome unknown
coaſts, where their proviſion of fiſh is found in greateſt
abundance.</p>
                  <p>Before I go to the third general diviſion of water-fowls, it
may not be improper to obſerve, that there is one ſpecies of round billed
water-fowl, that does not properly lie within any of the former
diſtributions. This is the Gooſe-ander; a bird with the body and wing
ſhaped like thoſe of the penguin kind, but with legs not hid in the belly.
It may be diſtinguiſhed from all others by its bill, which is round, hooked
at the point, and toothed, both upper and under chap, like a ſaw. Its colours
are <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0823900106:115"/> various and beautiful: however, its manners and
appetites entirely reſemble thoſe of the Diver. It feeds upon fiſh, for
which it dives; and is ſaid to build its neſt upon trees, like the heron
and the cormorant. It ſeems to form the ſhade between the penguin and the
gooſe kind; having a round bill, like the one; and unembarraſſed legs,
like the other. In the ſhape of the head, neck and body, it reſembles them
both.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. Of Birds of the Gooſe Kind, properly ſo
called.</head>
                  <p>THE Swan, the Gooſe, and the Duck, are leaders of a
numerous, uſeful, and beautiful tribe of birds, that we have reclaimed from a
ſtate of nature, and have taught to live in dependance about us. To
deſcribe any of theſe would be as ſuperfluous as definitions uſually
are when given of things with which we are already well acquainted. There are
few that have not had opportunities of ſeeing them, and whoſe ideas would
not anticipate our deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, though nothing be ſo eaſy as to
diſtinguiſh theſe in general from each other, yet the largeſt of the
duck-kind approach the gooſe ſo nearly, that it may be proper to mark the
diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>The marks of the gooſe are, a bigger body, large wings, a
longer neck, a white ring about the rump, a bill thicker at the baſe,
ſlenderer towards the tip, with ſhorter legs, placed more forward on the
body. They both have a wadling walk; but the duck, from the poſition of its
legs, has it in a greater degree. By theſe marks, theſe ſimilar tribes
may be known <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0823900106:117"/> aſunder; and though the duck ſhould be
found to equal the gooſe in ſize, which ſometimes happens, yet there are
ſtill other ſufficient diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>But they all agree in many particulars; and have a nearer
affinity to each other than the neighbouring kinds in any other depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Their having been tamed has produced alterations in each, by which they differ
as much from the wild ones of their reſpective kinds as they do among
themſelves. There is nearly as much difference between the wild and the tame
duck, as between ſome ſorts of the duck and the gooſe; but ſtill, the
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics of the kind are ſtrongly marked and obvious; and this
tribe can never be miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>The bill is the firſt great obvious diſtinction of the
gooſe-kind from all of the feathered tribe. In other birds it is round and
wedge-like, or crooked at the end. In all the gooſe kind it is flat and
broad, made for the purpoſes of ſkim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ponds and lakes of the mantling
weeds that ſtand on the ſurface. The bills of other birds are made of an
horny ſubſtance through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; theſe have their inoffenſive bills
ſheathed with a ſkin which covers them all over. The bill of every other
bird ſeems in ſome meaſure formed for piercing or tearing; theirs are
only <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0823900106:118"/> fitted for ſhoveling up their food, which is
chiefly of the vegetable kind.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe birds do not reject animal food when offered
them, yet they can contentedly ſubſiſt upon vegetables, and ſeldom
ſeek any other. They are eaſily provided for; wherever there is water,
there ſeems to be plenty. All the other web-footed tribes are continually
vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious, continually preying. Theſe lead more harmleſs lives: the weeds
on the ſurface of the water, or the inſects at the bottom, the graſs by
the bank, or the fruits and corn in cultivated grounds, are ſufficient to
ſatisfy their eaſy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites: yet theſe, like every other animal, will
not reject fleſh, if properly prepared for them; it is ſufficient praiſe
to them that they do not eagerly purſue it.</p>
                  <p>As their food is chiefly vegetables, ſo their fecundity is
in proportion. We have had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent opportunities to obſerve, that all the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory tribes, whether of birds or quadrupedes, are barren and unfruitful.
We have ſeen the lion with its two cubs; the eagle with the ſame number;
and the penguin with even but one. Nature that has ſupplied them with powers
of deſtruction, has denied them fertility. But it is otherwiſe with theſe
harmleſs animals I am deſcribing. They ſeem formed to fill up the
chaſms in animated nature, cauſed by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raciouſneſs 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0823900106:119"/> of others. They breed in great abundance, and lead their
young to the pool the inſtant they are excluded.</p>
                  <p>As their food is ſimple, ſo their fleſh is nouriſhing
and wholeſome. The ſwan was conſidered as a high delicacy among the
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; the gooſe was abſtained from as totally indigeſtible. Modern
manners have inverted taſtes; the gooſe is now become the favourite; and
the ſwan is ſeldom brought to table unleſs for the purpoſes of
oſtentation. But at all times the fleſh of the duck was in high eſteem;
the ancients thought even more highly of it than we do. We are contented to eat
it as a delicacy; they alſo conſidered it as a medicine; and Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch
aſſures us, that Cato kept his whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in health, by feeding them
with duck whenever they threatened to be out of order.</p>
                  <p>Theſe qualities of great fecundity, eaſy ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and wholeſome nouriſhment, have been found ſo conſiderable as to induce
man to take theſe birds from a ſtate of nature and render them domeſtic.
How long they have been thus dependants upon his pleaſures is not known; for
from the earlieſt accounts, they were conſidered as familiars about him.
The time muſt have been very remote; for there have been many changes wrought
in <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0823900106:120"/> their colours, their figures, and even their internal
parts, by human cultivation. The different kinds of theſe birds, in a wild
ſtate, are ſimple in their colourings: when one has ſeen a wild gooſe
or a wild duck, a deſcription of its plumage will, to a feather, exactly
corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with that of any other. But in the tame kinds no two of any
ſpecies are exactly alike. Different in their ſize, their colours, and
fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in their general form. They ſeem the mere creatures of art; and,
having been ſo long dependant upon man for ſupport, they ſeem to
aſſume forms entirely ſuited to his pleaſures or neceſſities.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. Of the Swan, tame and wild.</head>
                  <p>NO bird makes a more indifferent figure upon land, or a more
beautiful one in the water, than the Swan. When it aſcends from its
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite element, its motions are aukward, and its neck is ſtretched
forward with an air of ſtupidity; but when it is ſeen ſmoothly ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
along the water, commanding a thouſand graceful attitudes, moving at
pleaſure without the ſmalleſt effort, when it 
<q rend="inline">"proudly rows its ſtate," as Milton has it,
"with arched neck, between its white wings mantling,"</q> there is not a more
beautiful figure in all nature. In the exhibition of its form, there are no
broken or harſh lines; no conſtrained or catching mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but the
roundeſt contours, and the eaſieſt tranſitions; the eye wanders over
every part with inſatiable pleaſure, and every part takes a new grace with
new motion.</p>
                  <p>This fine bird has long been rendered do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic; and it is
now a doubt whether there be any of the tame kind in a ſtate of nature. The
wild ſwan, though ſo ſtrongly reſembling this in colour and form, is
yet a different bird; for it <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0823900106:122"/> is very differently formed
within. The wild ſwan is leſs than the tame by almoſt a fourth; for as
the one weighs twenty pounds, the other only weighs ſixteen pounds and three
quarters. The colour of the tame ſwan is all over white; that of the wild
bird is, along the back and the tips of the wings, of an aſh-colour. But
theſe are ſlight differences, compared to what are found upon
diſſection. In the tame ſwan, the wind-pipe ſinks down into the lungs
in the ordinary manner; but in the wild, after a ſtrange and wonderful
contortion, like what we have ſeen in the crane, it enters through a hole
formed in the breaſt-bone; and being reflected therein, returns by the ſame
aperture; and being contracted into a narrow compaſs by a broad and bony
cartilage, it is divided into two branches, which, before they enter the lungs,
are dilated and as it were ſwolen out into two cavities.</p>
                  <p>Such is the extraordinary difference between theſe two
animals, which externally ſeem to be of one ſpecies. Whether it is in the
power of long continued captivity and domeſtication to produce this ſtrange
variety, between birds otherwiſe the ſame, I will not take upon me to
determine. But certain it is, that our tame ſwan is no where to be found, at
leaſt in Europe, in a ſtate of nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0823900106:123"/>As it is not eaſy to account for this
difference of conformation, ſo it is ſtill more difficult to reconcile the
accounts of the ancients with the experience of the moderns, concerning the
vocal powers of this bird. The tame ſwan is one of the moſt ſilent of all
birds; and the wild one has a note extremely loud and diſagreeable. It is
probable, the convolutions of the wind-pipe may contribute to encreaſe the
clangor of it; for ſuch is the harſhneſs of its voice, that the bird from
thence has been called the Hooper. In neither is there the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of melody; nor have they, for above this century, been ſaid to give
ſpecimens of the ſmalleſt muſical abilities: yet, notwithſtanding
this, it was the general opinion of antiquity, that the ſwan was a moſt
melodious bird; and that, even to its death, its voice went on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving. It
would ſhew no learning to produce what they have ſaid upon the muſic of
the ſwan: it has already been collected by Aldrovandus; and ſtill more
profeſſedly by the Abbe Gedoyn, in the Tranſactions of the Academy of
Belles Lettres. From theſe accounts it appears that, while Plato,
Ariſtotle, and Diodorus Siculus, believed the vocality of the ſwan, Pliny
and Virgil ſeem to doubt that received opinion. In this equipoiſe of
authority, Aldrovandus ſeems to have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0823900106:124"/> in
favour of the Greek philoſophers; and the form of the wind-pipe in the wild
ſwan, ſo much reſembling a muſical inſtrument, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined his belief
ſtill more ſtrongly. In aid of this alſo, came the teſtimony of
Pendaſius, who affirmed, that he had often heard ſwans ſweetly ſinging
in the lake of Mantua, as he was rowed up and down in a boat; as alſo of
Olaus Wormius, who profeſſed that many of his friends and ſcholars had
heard them ſinging. 
<q rend="inline">"There was," ſays he, "in my family, a very
honeſt young man, John Roſtorph, a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in divinity, and a Norwegian
by nation. This man did, upon his credit, and with the interpoſition of an
oath, ſolemnly affirm that once, in the territory of Dronten, as he was
ſtanding on the ſea ſhore, early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he heard an unuſual
and ſweet murmur, compoſed of moſt pleaſant whiſtlings and ſounds;
he knew not at firſt whence they came, or how they were made, for he ſaw no
man near to produce them; but looking round about him, and climbing to the top
of a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, he there eſpied an infinite number of ſwans
gathered together in a bay, and making the moſt delightful harmony: a
ſweeter in all his life-time he had never heard."</q> Theſe were accounts
ſufficient at leaſt to keep opinion in ſuſpenſe, though in
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0823900106:125"/> to our own experience; but Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus,
to put, as he ſuppoſed, the queſtion paſt all doubt, gives us the
teſtimony of a country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of our own, from whom he had the relation. This
honeſt man's name was Mr. George Braun, who aſſured him, that nothing was
more common in England, than to hear ſwans ſing; that they were bred in
great numbers in the ſea, near London; and that every fleet of ſhips that
returned from their voyages from diſtant countries, were met by ſwans, that
came joyfully out to welcome their return, and ſalute them with a loud and
chearful ſinging! It was in this manner that Aldrovandus, that great and good
man, was frequently impoſed upon by the deſigning and the needy: his
unbounded cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity drew round him people of every kind, and his
generoſity was as ready to reward falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood as truth—Poor
Aldrovandus! after having ſpent a vaſt fortune, for the purpoſes of
enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening mankind; after having collected more truth and more
falſeſhood than any man ever did before him, he little thought of being
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at laſt to want bread, to feel the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his country, and
to die a beggar in a public hoſpital!</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears that our modern authorities, in favour of the
ſinging of ſwans, are rather <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0823900106:126"/> ſuſpicious, ſince
they are reduced to this Mr. George Braun, and John Roſtorph, the native of a
country remarkable for ignorance and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity. It is probable the ancients
had ſome mythological meaning in aſcribing melody to the ſwan; and as for
the moderns, they ſcarce deſerve our regard. The ſwan, therefore, muſt
be content with that ſhare of fame which it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes on the ſcore
of its beauty; ſince the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of its voice, without better teſtimony,
will ſcarcely be admitted by even the credulous.</p>
                  <p>This beautiful bird is as delicate in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, as
elegant in its form. Its chief food is corn, bread, herbs growing in the water,
and roots and ſeeds, which are found near the margin. It prepares a neſt in
ſome retired part of the bank, and chiefly where there is an iſlet in the
ſtream. This is compoſed of water-plants, long graſs and ſticks; and
the male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male aſſiſt in forming it with great aſſiduity. The
ſwan lays ſeven or eight eggs, white, much larger than thoſe of a
gooſe, with a hard, and ſometimes a tuberous ſhell. It ſits near two
months before its young are excluded; which are aſh-coloured when they
firſt leave the ſhell, and for ſome months after. It is not a little
dangerous to approach the old ones, when their little family are feeding round
them. Their <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0823900106:127"/> fears, as well as their pride, ſeems to
take the alarm; and they have ſometimes been known to give a blow with their
pinion, that has broke a man's leg or arm.</p>
                  <p>It is not till they are a twelve-month old that the young
ſwans change their colour with their plumage. All the ſtages of this bird's
approach to maturity are ſlow, and ſeem to mark its longevity. It is two
months hatching; a year in growing to its proper ſize; and if, according to
Pliny's obſervation, that thoſe animals that are longeſt in the womb are
the longeſt lived, the ſwan is the longeſt in the ſhell of any bird we
know, and is ſaid to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for its longevity. Some ſay that it
lives three hundred years; and Willoughby, who is in general diffident enough,
ſeems to believe the report. A gooſe, as he juſtly obſerves, has been
known to live an hundred; and the ſwan, from its ſuperior ſize, and from
its harder, firmer fleſh, may naturally be ſuppoſed to live ſtill
longer.</p>
                  <p>Swans were formerly held in ſuch great eſteem in England,
that, by an act of Edward the Fourth, none, except the ſon of the king, was
permitted to keep a ſwan, unleſs poſſeſſed of five marks a year. By
a ſubſequent act, the puniſhment for taking their eggs was
impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0823900106:128"/> for a year and a day, and a fine at the
king's will. At preſent they are but little valued for the delicacy of their
fleſh; but many are ſtill preſerved for their beauty. We ſee multitudes
on the Thames and Trent; but no where greater numbers than on the ſalt-water
inlet of the ſea near Abbotſberry, in Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. Of the Gooſe and its Varieties.</head>
                  <p>THE Gooſe, in its domeſtic ſtate, exhibits a variety of
colours. The wild gooſe always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſame marks: the whole upper
part is aſh-coloured; the breaſt and belly are of a dirty white; the bill
is narrow at the baſe, and at the tip it is black; the legs are of a
ſaffron colour, and the claws black. Theſe marks are ſeldom found in the
tame; whoſe bill is entirely red, and whoſe legs are entirely brown. The
wild gooſe is rather leſs than the tame; but both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably retain a
white ring round their tail, which ſhews that they are both deſcended from
the ſame original.</p>
                  <p>The wild gooſe is ſuppoſed to breed in the northern
parts of Europe; and, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of winter, to deſcend into more
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate regions. They are often ſeen flying at very great heights, in
flocks from fifty to an hundred, and ſeldom reſting by day. Their cry is
frequently heard when they are at an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible diſtance above us; and
this ſeems bandied from one to the other, as among hounds in the purſuit.
Whether this be the <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0823900106:130"/> note of mutual encouragement, or the
neceſſary conſequence of reſpiration, is doubtful; but they ſeldom
exert it when they alight in theſe journies.</p>
                  <p>Upon their coming to the ground by day, they range
themſelves in a line, like cranes; and ſeem rather to have deſcended for
reſt, than for other refreſhment. When they have ſat in this manner for
an hour or two, I have heard one of them, with a loud long note, ſound a kind
of charge, to which the reſt punctually attended, and they purſued their
journey with renewed alacrity. Their flight is very regularly arranged: they
either go in a line a-breaſt, or in two lines, joining in an angle in the
middle. I doubt whether the form of their flight be thus arranged to cut the
air with greater eaſe, as is commonly believed; I am more apt to think it is
to preſent a ſmaller mark to fowlers from below. A bullet might eaſily
reach them, if huddled together in a flock, and the ſame diſcharge might
deſtroy ſeveral at once; but, by their manner of flying, no ſhot from
below can affect above one of them; and from the height at which they fly, this
is not eaſy to be hit.</p>
                  <p>The Barnacle differs in ſome reſpects from both theſe;
being leſs than either, with a <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0823900106:131"/> black bill, much
ſhorter than either of the preceding. It is ſcarce neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
the idle error of this bird's being bred from a ſhell ſticking to ſhip's
bottoms; it is well known to be hatched from an egg, in the ordinary manner,
and to differ in very few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars from all the reſt of its kind.</p>
                  <p>The Brent Gooſe is ſtill leſs than the former, and not
bigger than a Muſcovy duck, except that the body is longer. The head, neck,
and upper part of the breaſt, are black; but about the middle of the neck, on
each ſide, are two ſmall ſpots or lines of white, which together appear
like a ring.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and many other varieties, are found in this kind;
which agree in one common cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of feeding upon vegetables, and being
remarkable for their fecundity. Of theſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the tame gooſe is the
moſt fruitful. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs to fear from its enemies, leading a ſecurer
and a more plentiful life, its prolific powers encreaſe in proportion to its
eaſe; and though the wild gooſe ſeldom lays above eight eggs, the tame
gooſe is often ſeen to lay above twenty. The female hatches her eggs with
great aſſiduity; while the Gander viſits her twice or thrice a day, and
ſometimes drives her off to take her place, where he ſits with great
ſtate and compoſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0823900106:132"/>But beyond that of all animals is his
pride when the young are excluded: he ſeems then to conſider himſelf as a
champion not only obliged to defend his young, but alſo to keep off the
ſuſpicion of danger; he purſues dogs and men that never attempt to
moleſt him; and, though the moſt harmleſs thing alive, is then the moſt
petulant and provoking. When, in this manner, he has purſued the calf or the
maſtiff, to whoſe contempt alone he is indebted for ſafety, he returns to
his female and her brood in triumph, clapping his wings, ſcreaming, and
ſhewing all the marks of conſcious ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority. It is probable, however,
theſe arts ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in raiſing his importance among the tribe where they
are diſplayed; and it is probable there is not a more reſpectable animal on
earth to a gooſe than a gander!</p>
                  <p>A young gooſe is generally reckoned very good eating; yet
the feathers of this bird ſtill farther encreaſe its value. I feel my
obligations to this animal every word I write; for, however deficient a man's
head may be, his pen is nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough upon every occaſion: it is happy
indeed for us, that it requires no great effort to put it in motion. But the
feathers of this bird are ſtill as valuable in another capacity, as they make
the ſofteſt and the warmeſt beds to ſleep on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0823900106:133"/>Of gooſe-feathers moſt of our beds
in Europe are compoſed; in the countries bordering on the Levant, and in all
Aſia, the uſe of them is utterly unknown. They there uſe matraſſes,
ſtuffed with wool, or camel's hair or cotton; and the warmth of their climate
may perhaps make them diſpenſe with cuſhions of a ſofter kind. But how
it happens that the ancients had not the uſe of feather-beds, is to me
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing: Pliny tell us, indeed, that they made bolſters of feathers to
lay their heads on; and this ſerves as a proof that they turned feathers to
no other uſes.</p>
                  <p>As feathers are a very valuable commodity, great numbers of
geeſe are kept tame in the fens in Lincolnſhire, which are plucked once or
twice a year. Theſe make a conſiderable article of commerce. The feathers
of Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire are moſt in eſteem; thoſe of Ireland are reckoned
the worſt. Hudſon's Bay alſo furniſhes very fine feathers, ſuppoſed
to be of the gooſe kind. The down of the ſwan is brought from Dantzic. The
ſame place alſo ſends us great quantities of the feathers of the cock and
hen; but Greenland, Iceland, and Norway, furniſh the beſt feathers of all:
and in this number we may reckon the Eider down, of which we ſhall take
notice in its place. The <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0823900106:134"/> beſt method of curing
feathers, is to lay them in a room in an open expoſure to the ſun, and,
when dried, to put them into bags, and beat them well with poles to get the
duſt off. But, after all, nothing will prevent, for a time, the heavy ſmell
which ariſes from the putrefaction of the oil contained in every feather; no
expoſure will draw this off, how long ſoever it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; they muſt
be lain upon, which is the only remedy: and, for this reaſon, old feathers
are much more valuable than new.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. Of the Duck and its Varieties.</head>
                  <p>THE Tame Duck is the moſt eaſily reared of all our
domeſtic animals. The very inſtincts of the young ones direct them to their
favourite element; and though they are conducted by a hen, yet they deſpiſe
the admonitions of their leader.</p>
                  <p>This ſerves as an inconteſtible proof that all birds have
their manners rather from nature than education. A falcon purſues the
partridge, not becauſe it is taught by the old one, but becauſe its
appetites make their importunate call for animal food; the cuckoo follows a
very different trade from that which its nurſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to teach it; and,
if we may credit Pliny, in time deſtroys its inſtructor: animals of the
duck kind alſo follow their appetites, not their tutor, and come to all their
various perfections without any guide. All the arts poſſeſſed by man,
are the reſult of accumulated experience; all the arts of inferior animals
are ſelf-taught, and ſcarce one acquired by imitation.</p>
                  <p>It is uſual with the good women to lay duck-eggs under a
hen, becauſe ſhe hatches them <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0823900106:136"/> better than the
original parent would have done. The duck ſeems to be an heedleſs,
inattentive mother; ſhe frequently leaves her eggs till they ſpoil, and
even ſeems to forget that ſhe is entruſted with the charge: ſhe is
equally regardleſs of them when excluded; ſhe leads them to the pond, and
thinks ſhe has ſufficiently provided for her offspring when ſhe has
ſhewn them the water. Whatever advantages may be procured by coming near the
houſe, or attending in the yard, ſhe declines them all; and often lets the
vermin, who haunt the waters, deſtroy them, rather than bring them to take
ſhelter nearer home. The hen is a nurſe of a very oppoſite character;
ſhe broods with the utmoſt aſſiduity, and generally brings forth a
young one from every egg com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her charge; ſhe does not lead her
younglings to the water indeed, but ſhe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guards them when there by
ſtanding at the brink. Should the rat, or the weazle, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſeize
them, the hen can give them protection; ſhe leads them to the houſe when
tired with padling, and rears up the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious brood, without ever
ſuſpecting that they belong to another.</p>
                  <p>The wild duck differs, in many reſpects, from the tame; and
in them there is ſtill greater <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0823900106:137"/> variety than among the
domeſtic kinds. Of the tame duck there are not leſs than ten different
ſorts; and of the wild, Briſſon reckons above twenty. The moſt obvious
diſtinction between wild and tame ducks is in the colour of their feet;
thoſe of the tame duck being black; thoſe of the wild duck yellow. The
difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween wild ducks among each other, ariſes as well from their
ſize as the nature of the place they feed in. Sea-ducks, which feed in the
ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and dive much, have a broad bill, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upwards, a large hind
toe, and a long blunt tail. Pond-ducks, which feed in plaſhes, have a
ſtraight and narrow bill, a ſmall hind toe, and a ſharp pointed train.
The former are called, by our decoy-men, foreign ducks; the latter are
ſuppoſed to be natives of England. It would be tedious to enter into the
minute varieties of ſuch a number of birds; all agreeing in the ſame
general figure, the ſame habits and mode of living, and differing in little
more than their ſize and the colours of their plumage. In this tribe, we may
rank, as natives of our own European dominions, the Eider Duck, which is double
the ſize of a common duck, with a black bill; the Velvet Duck, not ſo
large, and with a yellow bill; the Scoter, with a knob at the baſe of a
yellow bill; the Tufted Duck, <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0823900106:138"/> adorned with a thick
creſt; the Scaup Duck, leſs than the common duck, with the bill of a
greyiſh blue colour; the Golden Eye, with a large white ſpot at the corners
of the mouth, reſembling an eye; the Sheldrake, with the bill of a bright
red, and ſwelling into a knob; the Mallard, which is the ſtock from whence
our tame breed has probably been produced; the Pintail, with the two middle
feathers of the tail three inches longer than the reſt; the Pochard, with the
head and neck of a bright bay; the Widgeon, with a lead-coloured bill, and the
plumage of the back marked with narrow black and white undulated lines, but
beſt known by its whiſtling ſound: laſtly, the Teal, which is the
ſmalleſt of this kind, with the bill black, the head and upper part of the
neck of a bright bay. Theſe are the moſt common birds of the duck kind
among ourſelves; but who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the amazing variety of this tribe,
if he extends his view to the different quarters of the world? The moſt noted
of the foreign tribe are, the Muſcovy duck, or, more properly ſpeaking, the
Muſk Duck, ſo called from a ſuppoſed muſky ſmell, with naked ſkin
round the eyes, and which is a native of Africa. The Braſilian Duck, that is
of the ſize of a gooſe, all over black except the tips of the wings. The
American Wood Duck, with a variety of <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0823900106:139"/> beautiful colours,
and a plume of feathers that falls from the back of the head like a friar's
cowl. Theſe, and twenty others, might be added, were encreaſing the number
of names the way to enlarge the ſphere of our compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
                  <p>All theſe live in the manner of our domeſtic ducks,
keeping together in flocks in the winter, and flying in pairs in ſummer,
bringing up their young by the water-ſide, and leading them to their food as
ſoon as out of the ſhell. Their neſts are uſually built among heath or
ruſhes, not far from the water; and they lay twelve, fourteen, or more eggs
before they ſit: yet this is not always their method; the dangers they
con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually encounter from their ground ſituation, ſometimes obliges them
to change their manner of building; and their aukward neſts are often ſeen
exalted on the tops of trees. This muſt be a very great labour to perform, as
the duck's bill is but ill-formed for building a neſt, and giving the
materials of which it is compoſed a ſufficient ſtability to ſtand the
weather. The neſt, whether high or low, is generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of
ſingular materials. The longeſt graſs, mixed with heath, and lined within
with the bird's own feathers, uſually go to the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: however, in
proportion as the climate <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0823900106:140"/> is colder, the neſt is more
artificially made, and more warmly lined. In the Artic regions, nothing can
exceed the great care all of this kind take to protect their eggs from the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſs of the weather. While the gull and the penguin kind ſeem to
diſregard the ſevereſt cold, the duck, in thoſe regions, forms itſelf
a hole to lay in, ſhelters the approach, lines it with a layer of long
graſs and clay, within that another of moſs, and laſtly, a warm coat of
fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or down. The eider duck is particularly remarkable for the warmth of
its neſt. This bird, which, as was ſaid, is above twice as large as the
common duck, and reſides in the colder climates, lays from ſix to eight
eggs, making her neſt among the rocks or the plants along the ſea-ſhore.
The external materials of the neſt are ſuch as are in common with the
reſt of the kind; but the inſide lining, on which the eggs are immediately
depoſited, is at once the ſofteſt, warmeſt, and the lighteſt
ſubſtance with which we are acquainted. This is no other than the inſide
down which covers the breaſt of the bird in the breeding-ſeaſon. This the
fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male plucks off with her bill, and furniſhes the inſide of her neſt
with a tapeſtry more valuable than the moſt ſkilful artiſts can
produce. The natives watch the place where ſhe begins to 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0823900106:141"/> build, and, ſuffering her to lay, take away both the
eggs and the neſt. The duck, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not diſcouraged by the firſt
diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, builds and lays in the ſame place a ſecond time; and
this they in the ſame manner take away: the third time ſhe builds, but the
drake muſt ſupply the down from his breaſt to line the neſt with: and,
if this be robbed, they both forſake the place, and breed there no more. This
down the natives take care to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the dirt and moſs with which
it is mixed; and, though no people ſtand in more need of a warm covering than
themſelves, yet their neceſſities compel them to ſell it to the more
indolent and luxurious inhabitants of the ſouth for brandy and tobacco.</p>
                  <p>As they poſſeſs the faculties of flying and ſwimming,
ſo they are in general birds of paſſage, and it is moſt probable
perform their journies acroſs the ocean as well on the water as in the air.
Thoſe that migrate to this country, on the approach of winter, are ſeldom
found ſo well taſted or ſo fat as the fowls that continue with us the
year round: their fleſh is often lean, and ſtill oftner fiſhy; which
flavour it has probably contracted in the journey, as their food in the lakes
of Lapland, from whence they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, is generally of the inſect kind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0823900106:142"/>As ſoon as they arrive among us, they
are generally ſeen flying in flocks to make a ſurvey of thoſe lakes where
they intend to take up their reſidence for the winter. In the choice of
theſe they have two objects in view; to be near their food, and yet remote
from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Their chief aim is to chuſe ſome lake in the
neighbourhood of a marſh where there is at the ſame time a cover of woods
and where inſects are found in greateſt abundance. Lakes, therefore, with a
marſh on one ſide and a wood on the other, are ſeldom without vaſt
quantities of wild fowl; and where a couple are ſeen at any time, that is a
ſufficient inducement to bring hundreds of others. The ducks flying in the
air are often lured down from their heights by the loud voice of the mallard
from below. Nature ſeems to have furniſhed this bird with very particular
faculties for calling. The wind pipe, where it begins to enter the lungs, opens
into a kind of bony cavity, where the ſound is reflected as in a muſical
inſtrument, and is heard a great way off. To this call all the ſtragglers
reſort; and in a week or a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night's time, a lake that before was quite
naked is black with water-fowl, that have left their Lapland retreats to keep
company with our ducks who never ſtirred from home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0823900106:143"/>They generally chuſe that part of the
lake where they are inacceſſible to the approach of the fowler, in which
they all appear huddled together, extremely buſy and very loud. What it is
can employ them all the day is not eaſy to gueſs. There is no food for them
at the place where they ſit and cabal thus, as they chuſe the middle of the
lake; and as for courtſhip, the ſeaſon for that is not yet come; ſo
that it is wonderful what can ſo buſily keep them occupied. Not one of them
ſeems a moment at reſt. Now purſuing one another, now ſcreaming, then
all up at once, then down again; the whole ſeems one ſtrange ſcene of
buſtle with nothing to do.</p>
                  <p>They frequently go off in a more private manner by night to
feed in the adjacent meadows and ditches, which they dare not venture to
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by day. In theſe nocturnal adventures they are often taken; for,
though a timorous bird, yet they are eaſily deceived, and every ſpringe
ſeems to ſucceed in taking them. But the greateſt quantities are taken in
decoys; which, though well known near London, are yet untried in the remoter
parts of the country. The manner of making and managing a decoy is as
follows.</p>
                  <p>A place is to be choſen for this purpoſe far remote from
the common highway and all noiſe <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0823900106:144"/> of people. A decoy is
beſt where there is a large pond ſurrounded by a wood, and beyond that a
marſhy and uncultivated country. When the place is choſen, the pool, if
poſſible, is to be planted round with willows, unleſs a wood anſwers
the purpoſe of ſhading it on every ſide. On the ſouth and north ſide
of this pool are two, three, or four ditches or channels, made broad towards
the pool, and growing narrower till they end in a point. Theſe channels are
to be covered over with nets, ſupported by hooped ſticks bending from one
ſide to the other; ſo that they form a vault or arch growing narrower and
narrower to the point, where it is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by a tunnel-net, like that in
which fiſh are caught in weirs Along the banks of theſe channels ſo
netted over, which are called pipes, many hedges are made of reeds ſlanting
to the edge of the channel, the acute angles to the ſide next the pool. The
whole apparatus alſo is to be hidden from the pool by a hedge of reeds along
the margin, behind which the fowler manages his operations. The place being
fitted in this manner, the fowler is to provide himſelf with a number of wild
ducks made tame, which are called decoys. Theſe are always to be fed at the
mouth or entrance of the pipe, and to be accuſtomed to come at a
whiſtle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0823900106:145"/>As ſoon as the evening is ſet in,
<hi>the decoy riſes,</hi> as they term it, and the wild fowl feed during the
night. If the evening be ſtill, the noiſe of their wings, during their
flight, is heard at a very great diſtance, and produces no unpleaſing
ſenſation. The fowler, when he finds a fit opportunity, and ſees his
decoy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with fowl, walks about the pool, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves into what pipe
the birds gathered in the pool may be enticed or driven. Then caſting
hemp-ſeed, or ſome ſuch ſeed as will float on the ſuface of the
water, at the entrance and up along the pipe, he whiſtles to his decoy-ducks,
who inſtantly obey the ſummons, and come to the entrance of the pipe, in
hopes of being fed as uſual. Thither alſo they are followed by a whole
flock of wild ones, who little ſuſpect the danger preparing againſt them.
Their ſenſe of ſmelling however is very exquiſite; and they would
ſoon diſcover their enemy, but that the fowler always keeps a piece of turf
burning at his noſe, againſt which he breathes; and this prevents the
effluvia of his perſon from reaching their exquiſite ſenſes. The wild
ducks, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, purſuing the decoy-ducks, are led into the broad mouth of
the channel or pipe, nor have the leaſt ſuſpicion of the man who keeps
hidden behind one of the hedges. When they <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0823900106:146"/> have got up
the pipe however, finding it grow more and more narrow, they begin to
ſuſpect danger, and would return back; but they are now prevented by the
man, who ſhews himſelf at the broad end below. Thither, therefore, they
dare not return; and riſe they may not, as they are kept by the net above
from aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The only way left them, therefore, is the narrow funnelled
net at the bottom; into this they fly, and there they are taken.</p>
                  <p>It often happens, however, that the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl are in ſuch a
ſtate of ſleepineſs or dozing, that they will not follow the decoy ducks.
Uſe is then generally made of a dog who is taught his leſſon. He
paſſes backward and forward between the reed-hedges, in which there are
little holes, both for the decoy-man to ſee and for the little dog to paſs
through. This attracts the eye of the wild fowl; who, prompted by curioſity,
advance towards this little animal, while he all the time keeps playing among
the reeds, nearer and nearer the funnel, till they follow him too far to
recede. Sometimes the dog will not attract their attention till a red
handkerchief, or ſomething very ſingular, be put about him. The decoy-ducks
never enter the funnel-net with the reſt, being taught to dive under water as
ſoon as the reſt are driven in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0823900106:147"/>The general ſeaſon for catching fowl
in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coys is from the latter end of October till Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary. The taking them
earlier is prohibited by an act of George the Second, which impoſes a penalty
of five ſhillings for every bird de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed at any other ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Lincolnſhire decoys are commonly let at a certain annual
rent, from five pounds to twenty pounds a year; and ſome even amount to
thirty. Theſe principally contribute to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the markets of London with
wild-fowl. The number of ducks, wigeon, and teal, that are ſent thither is
amazing. Above thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand have been ſent up in one ſeaſon from
ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coys in the neighbourhood of Wainfleet. This quantity makes them ſo
cheap on the ſpot, that it is aſſerted, the ſeveral decoy-men would be
glad to contract for years to deliver their ducks at the next town for
ten-pence the couple.</p>
                  <p>To this manner of taking wild-fowl in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I will
ſubjoin another ſtill more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, frequently practiſed in China.
When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the fowler ſees a number of ducks ſettled in any particular
plaſh of water, he ſends off two or three gourds to float among them.
Theſe gourds reſemble our pompions; but, being made hollow, they ſwim on
the ſurface <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0823900106:148"/> of the water; and on one pool there may
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be ſeen twenty or thirty of theſe gourds floating together.
The fowl at firſt are a little ſhy of coming near them; but by degrees they
come nearer; and as all birds at laſt grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with a ſcare-crow, the
ducks gather about theſe, and amuſe themſelves by whetting their bills
againſt them. When the birds are as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with the gourds as the fowler
could wiſh, he then prepares to deceive them in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. He hollows
out one of theſe gourds large enough to put his head in; and, making holes to
breathe and ſee through, he claps it on his head. Thus accoutred, he wades
ſlowly into the water, keeping his body under, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his head in
the gourd above the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; and in that manner moves imperceptibly towards
the fowls, who ſuſpect no danger. At laſt, however, he fairly gets in
among them; while they, having been long uſed to ſee gourds, take not the
leaſt fright while the enemy is in the very midſt of them; and an
inſiduous enemy he is; for ever as he approaches a fowl, he ſeizes it by
the legs, and draws it in a jerk under water. There he faſtens it under his
girdle, and goes to the next, till he has thus loaded himſelf with as many as
he can carry away. When he <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0823900106:149"/> has got his quantity, without
ever attempting to diſturb the reſt of the fowls on the pool, he ſlowly
moves off-again; and in this manner pays the flock three or four viſits in a
day. Of all the various artifices for catching fowl, this ſeems likely to be
attended with the greateſt ſucceſs, as it is the moſt practiſed in
China.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the King-Fiſher.</head>
                  <p>I Will conclude this hiſtory of birds with one that ſeems
to unite in itſelf ſomewhat of every claſs preceding. It ſeems at once
poſſeſſed of appetites for prey like the rapacious kinds, with an
attachment to water like the birds of that element. It exhibits in its form the
beautiful plumage of the peacock, the ſhadings of the humming-bird, the bill
of the crane, and the ſhort legs of the ſwallow. The bird I mean is the
King-Fiſher, of which many extraordinary falſehoods have been propagated;
and yet of which many extraordinary things remain to be ſaid that are
actually true.</p>
                  <p>The king-fiſher is not much larger than a ſwallow; its
ſhape is clumſy; the legs diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably ſmall, and the bill
diſproportionably long; it is two inches from the baſe to the tip; the
upper chap black and the lower yellow; but the colours of this bird attone for
its inele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant form; the crown of the head and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts of the wings are of
a deep blackiſh green, ſpotted with bright azure; the back and tail are of
the moſt reſplendent azure; the whole under-ſide of the body is
orange-coloured; a <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0823900106:151"/> broad mark of the ſame paſſes
from the bill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the eyes; beyond that is a large white ſpot: the tail
is ſhort, and conſiſts of twelve feathers of a rich deep blue; the feet
are of a reddiſh yellow, and the three joints of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt toe adhere to
the middle toe, while the inner toe adheres only by one.</p>
                  <p>From the diminutive ſize, the ſlender ſhort legs, and
the beautiful colours of this bird, no perſon would be led to ſuppoſe it
one of the moſt rapacious little animals that ſkims the deep. Yet it is for
ever on the wing, and feeds on fiſh, which it takes in ſurprizing
quantities, when we conſider its ſize and figure. It chiefly frequents the
banks of rivers, and takes its prey after the manner of the oſprey, balancing
itſelf at a certain diſtance above the water for a conſiderable ſpace,
then darting into the deep, and ſeizing the fiſh with inevitable
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. While it remains ſuſpended in the air, in a bright day, the
plumage exhibits a beautiful variety of the moſt dazzling and brilliant
colours. It might have been this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary beauty that has given riſe to
fable; for wherever there is any thing uncommon, fancy is always willing to
encreaſe the wonder.</p>
                  <p>Of this bird it has been ſaid that ſhe built her neſt on
the water, and thus in a few days hatched and produced her young. But, to be 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0823900106:152"/> uninterrupted in this taſk, ſhe was ſaid to be
poſſeſſed of a charm to allay the fury of the waves; and during this
period the mariner might ſail with the greateſt ſecurity. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
poets are full of theſe fables; their hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians are not exempt from them.
Cicero has written a long poem in praiſe of the halcyon, of which there
remains but two lines. Even the emperor Gordian has written a poem on this
ſubject, of which we have nothing remaining. Theſe fables have been adopted
each by one of the earlieſt fathers of the church. 
<q rend="inline">"Behold," ſays St. Ambroſe, "the little
bird which in the midſt of the winter lays her eggs on the ſand by the
ſhore. From that moment the winds are huſhed; the ſea becomes ſmooth;
and the calm continues for fourteen days. This is the time ſhe requires;
ſeven days to hatch, and ſeven days to foſter her young. Their Creator
has taught theſe little animals to make their neſt in the midſt of the
moſt ſtormy ſeaſon, only to manifeſt his kindneſs by granting them
a laſting calm. The ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not ignorant of this bleſſing; they
call this interval of fair weather their <hi>halcyon days</hi>; and they are
particularly careful to ſeize the opportunity, as then they need fear no
interruption."</q> This, and an hundred other <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0823900106:153"/>
inſtances might be given of the credulity of mankind with reſpect to this
bird; they entered into ſpeculations concerning the manner of her calming the
deep, the formation of her neſt, and her peculiar ſagacity; at preſent we
do not ſpeculate becauſe we know, with reſpect to our king-fiſher, that
moſt of the facts are falſe. It may be alledged, indeed, with ſome ſhew
of reaſon, that the Halcyon of the ancients was a different bird from our
king-fiſher; it may be urged, that many birds, eſpecially on the Indian
ocean, build a floating neſt upon the ſea; but ſtill, the hiſtory of
the ancient halcyon is clogged with endleſs fable; and it is but an
indifferent method to vindicate falſehood by ſhewing that a part of the
ſtory is true.</p>
                  <p>The king-fiſher with which we are acquainted at preſent,
has none of thoſe powers of allaying the ſtorm, or building upon the waves;
it is contented to make its neſt on the banks of rivers, in ſuch
ſituations as not to be affected by the riſing of the ſtream. When it has
found a place for its purpoſe, it hollows out with its bill a hole about a
yard deep; or if it finds the deſerted hole of a rat, or one cauſed by the
root of a tree decaying, it takes quiet poſſeſſion. This hole it
enlarges at the bottom to a good ſize; and, lining it with the down of the
willow, <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0823900106:154"/> lays its eggs there without any farther
prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>Its neſt, or rather hole, is very different from that
deſcribed by the ancients, by whom it is ſaid to be made in the ſhape of
a long necked gourd of the bones of the ſea-needle. The bones, indeed, are
found there in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities as well as the ſcales of fiſhes; but
theſe are the remains of the bird's food, and by no means brought there for
the purpoſes of warmth or convenience. The king-fiſher, as Bellonius
ſays, feeds upon fiſh, but is incapable of digeſting the bones and
ſcales, which he throws up again as eagles and owls are ſeen to do a part
of their prey. Theſe fill the bird's neſt of courſe; and, although they
ſeem as if deſignedly placed there, are only a kind of nuiſance.</p>
                  <p>In theſe holes, which, from the remains of fiſh brought
there, are very foetid, the king-fiſher is often found with from five eggs to
nine. There the female continues to hatch even though diſturbed; and though
the neſt be robbed, ſhe will again return and lay there. 
<q rend="inline">"I have had one of thoſe females brought
me," ſays Reaumur, "which was taken from her neſt about three leagues from
my houſe. After admiring the beauty of her colours, I let her 
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0823900106:155"/> fly again, when the fond creature was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſeen to return back to the neſt where ſhe had juſt before been made a
captive. There joining the male, ſhe again began to lay, though it was for
the third time, and though the ſeaſon was very far advanced. At each time
ſhe had ſeven eggs. The older the neſt is, the greater quantity of
fiſh-bones and ſcales does it contain: theſe are diſpoſed without any
order; and ſometimes take up a good deal of room."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The female begins to lay early in the ſeaſon; and excludes
her firſt brood about the beginning of April. The male, whoſe fidelity
exceeds even that of the turtle, brings her large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of fiſh while
ſhe is thus employed; and ſhe, contrary to moſt other birds, is found
plump and fat at that ſeaſon. The male, that uſed to twitter before this,
now enters the neſt as quietly and as privately as poſſible. The young
ones are hatched at the expiration of twenty days; but are ſeen to differ as
well in their ſize as in their beauty.</p>
                  <p>As the ancients have had their fables con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this bird,
ſo have the modern vulgar. It is an opinion generally received among them
that the fleſh of the king-fiſher will not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and that it will even
baniſh all vermin. <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0823900106:156"/> This has no better foundation than
that which is ſaid of its always pointing, when hung up dead, with its
breaſt to the north. The only truth which can be affirmed of this bird when
killed is, that its fleſh is utterly unfit to be eaten; while its beautiful
plumage preſerves its luſtre longer than that of any other bird we
know.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given a ſhort hiſtory of birds, I own I cannot
take leave of this moſt beautiful part of the creation without reluctance.
Theſe ſplendid inhabitants of air poſſeſs all thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that
can ſooth the heart and cheer the fancy. The brighteſt colours, the
roundeſt forms, the moſt active manners, and the ſweeteſt muſic. In
ſending the imagination in purſuit of theſe, in following them to the
chirruping grove, the ſcreaming precipice, or the glaſſy deep, the mind
naturally loſt the ſenſe of its own ſituation, and, attentive to their
little ſports, almoſt forgot the TASK of deſcribing them. Innocently to
amuſe the imagination in this dream of life is wiſdom; and nothing is
uſeleſs that, by furniſhing mental employment, keeps us for a while in
oblivion of thoſe ſtronger appetites that lead to evil. But every rank and
ſtate of mankind may find ſomething to imitate in thoſe delightful
ſongſters, and we <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0823900106:157"/> may not only employ the time, but
mend our lives by the contemplation. From their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in defence of their
young, and their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity in incubation, the coward may learn to be
brave, and the raſh to be patient. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable attachment of ſome to
their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions may give leſſons of fidelity; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubial
tenderneſs of others, be a monitor to the incontinent. Even thoſe that are
tyrants by nature never ſpread capricious deſtruction; and, unlike man,
never inflict a pain but when urged by neceſſity.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of Fiſhes in General.</head>
                  <p>THE ocean is the great receptacle of fiſhes. It has been
thought, by ſome, that all fiſh are naturally of that ſalt element; and
that they have mounted up into freſh water, by ſome accidental migration. A
few ſtill ſwim up rivers to depoſit their ſpawn; but of the great body
of fiſhes, of which the ſize is enormous and the ſhoals are endleſs,
thoſe all keep to the ſea, and would quickly expire in freſh water. In
that extenſive and undiſcovered abode, mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions reſide, whoſe manners
are a ſecret to us, and whoſe very form is unknown. The curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of
mankind, indeed, has drawn ſome from <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0823900106:160"/> their depths, and
his wants many more: with the figure of theſe at leaſt he is acquainted;
but for their purſuits, migrations, ſocieties, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies, pleaſures,
times of geſtation, and manner of bringing forth, theſe all are hidden in
the turbulent element that protects them.</p>
                  <p>The number of fiſh to which we have given names, and of the
figure, at leaſt, of which we know ſomething, according to Linnaeus, are
above four hundred. Thus to appearance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the hiſtory of fiſh is
tolerably copious; but when we come to examine, it will be found that of the
greateſt part of theſe we know very little. Thoſe qualities,
ſingularities or advantages, that render animals worth nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtill
remain to be diſcovered. The hiſtory of fiſhes, therefore, has little in
it entertaining: for our philoſophers hitherto, inſtead of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
their nature, have been employed in encreaſing their catalogues; and the
reader, inſtead of obſervations or facts, is preſented with a long liſt
of names, that diſguſt him with their barren ſuperfluity. It muſt
diſpleaſe him to ſee the language of a ſcience encreaſing, while the
ſcience itſelf has nothing to repay the encreaſing tax laid upon his
memory.</p>
                  <p>Moſt fiſh offer us the ſame external form; ſharp at
either end, and ſwelling in the middle; <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0823900106:161"/> by which they
are enabled to traverſe the fluid which they inhabit, with greater celerity
and eaſe. That peculiar ſhape which Nature has granted to moſt fiſhes,
we endeavour to imitate in ſuch veſſels as are deſigned to ſail with
the greateſt ſwiftneſs: however, the progreſs of a machine moved
forward in the water by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man contrivance, is nothing to the rapidity of an
animal deſtined by Nature to reſide there. Any of the large fiſh overtake
a ſhip in full ſail with great eaſe, play round it without effort, and
outſtrip it at pleaſure. Every part of the body ſeems exerted in this
diſpatch; the fins, the tail, and the motion of the whole back-bone,
aſſiſt progreſſion; and it is to that flexibility of body at which
art cannot arrive, that fiſhes owe their great velocity.</p>
                  <p>The chief inſtruments in a fiſh's motion, are the fins;
which, in ſome fiſh, are much more numerous than in others. A fiſh
completely fitted for ſailing, is furniſhed with not leſs than two pair;
alſo three ſingle fins, two above and one below. Thus equipped, it migrates
with the utmoſt rapidity, and takes voyages of a thouſand leagues in a
ſeaſon. But it does not always happen that ſuch fiſh as have the
greateſt number of fins have the ſwifteſt motion: the ſhark is thought
to be one of the ſwifteſt ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0823900106:162"/> yet it wants
the ventral or belly fins; the haddock does not move ſo ſwift, yet it is
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely fitted for motion.</p>
                  <p>But the fins ſerve not only to aſſiſt the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in
progreſſion, but in riſing or ſinking, in turning, or even leaping out
of the water. To anſwer theſe purpoſes, the pectoral fins ſerve, like
oars, to puſh the animal forward; they are placed at ſome little diſtance
behind the opening of the gills; they are generally large and ſtrong, and
anſwer the ſame purpoſes to the fiſh in the water, as wings do to a
bird in the air. With the help of theſe, and by their continued motion, the
flying-fiſh is ſometimes ſeen to riſe out of the water, and to fly
above an hundred yards; till, fatigued with its exertions, it is obliged to
ſink down again. Theſe alſo ſerve to balance the fiſh's head, when it
is too large for the body, and keep it from tumbling prone to the bottom, as is
ſeen in large headed fiſhes, when the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral fins are cut off. Next
theſe are ſeen the ventral fins, placed toward the lower part of the body,
under the belly: theſe are always ſeen to lie flat on the water, in
whatever ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the fiſh may be; and they ſerve rather to raiſe or
depreſs the fiſh in its element, than to aſſiſt progreſſive
motion. The dorſal fin is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated along the ridge of the back; and
ſerves <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0823900106:163"/> to keep it in equilibrio, as alſo to
aſſiſt its progreſſive motion. In many fiſhes this is wanting; but
in all flat fiſhes it is very large, as the pectoral fins are proportionably
ſmall. The anal fin occupies that part of the fiſh which lies between the
anus and the tail; and this ſerves to keep the fiſh in its upright or
vertical ſituation. Laſtly, the tail, which in ſome fiſhes is flat, and
upright in others, ſeems the grand inſtrument of motion: the fins are but
all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to it, and give direction to its great impetus, by which
the fiſh ſeems to dart for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with ſo much velocity. To explain all
this by experiment; a carp is taken, and put into a large veſſel. The
fiſh, in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſpreads all its fins, and ſeems to
reſt upon its pectoral and ventral fins near the bottom: if the fiſh folds
up, for it has the power of folding, either of its pectoral fins, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
to the ſame ſide; folding the right pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral fin, the fiſh inclines to
the right ſide; folding the left fin, it inclines to that ſide in turn.
When the fiſh deſires to have a retrogade motion, ſtriking with the
pectoral fins, in a contrary direction, effectually produces it. If the fiſh
deſires to turn, a blow from the tail ſends it about; but if the tail
ſtrikes both ways, then the motion is progreſſive. In purſuance 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0823900106:164"/> of theſe obſervations, if the dorſal and ventral
fins be cut off, the fiſh reels to the right and left, and endeavours to
ſupply its loſs by keeping the reſt of its fins in conſtant
employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If the right pectoral fin be cut off, the fiſh leans to that
ſide; if the ventral fin on the ſame ſide be cut away, then it loſes
its equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium entirely. When the tail is cut off, the fiſh loſes all
motion, and gives itſelf up to where the water impels it.</p>
                  <p>From hence it appears, that each of theſe inſtruments has
a peculiar uſe aſſigned it; but, at the ſame time, that they all
conſpire to aſſiſt each other's motions. Some fiſh are
poſſeſſed of all, whoſe motions are yet not the ſwifteſt; others
have but a part, and yet dart in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with great rapidity. The number,
the ſize, and the ſituation of the fins, therefore, ſeem rather
calculated to correſpond with the animal's figure, than ſolely to anſwer
the purpoſes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting its ſpeed. Where the head is large and heavy,
there the pectoral fins are large, and placed forward, to keep it from
overſetting. Where the head is ſmall, or produced out into a long beak, and
therefore not too heavy for the tail, the pectoral fins are ſmall, and the
ventral fins totally wanting.</p>
                  <p>As moſt animals that live upon land are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0823900106:165"/> with a covering to keep off the injuries of the weather,
ſo all that live in the water are covered with a ſlimy, glutinous matter,
that, like a ſheath, defends their bodies from the immediate contact of the
ſurrounding fluid. This ſubſtance may be conſidered as a ſecretion
from the pores of the animal's body; and ſerving, not only to defend, but to
aſſiſt the fiſh's eaſy progreſs through the water. Beneath this, in
many kinds, is found a ſtrong covering of ſcales, that, like a coat of
mail, defend it ſtill more powerfully; and under that, before we come to the
muſcular parts of the body, an oily ſubſtance, which ſupplies the
requiſite warmth and vigour.</p>
                  <p>The fiſh, thus protected and fitted for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its
natural element, ſeems as well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the means of happineſs as
quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes or birds; but if we come to examine its faculties more nearly, we
ſhall find it very much their inferior. The ſenſe of touching, which
beaſts and birds have in a ſmall degree, the fiſh, covered up in its own
coat of mail, can have but little acquaintance with.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſe of ſmelling, which in beaſts is ſo
exquiſite, and among birds is not wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, ſeems given to fiſhes
in a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate proportion. It is true, that all fiſhes 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0823900106:166"/> have one or more noſtrils; and even thoſe that have
not the holes perceptible without, yet have the proper formation of the bones
for ſmelling within. But as air is the only medium we know for the
diſtribution of odours, it cannot be ſuppoſed that theſe animals,
reſiding in water, can be poſſeſſed of any power of being affected by
them. If they have any perception of ſmells, it muſt be in the ſame
manner as we diſtinguiſh by our taſte; and, it is probable, the olfactory
membrane in fiſh ſerves them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a diſtinguiſhing palate: by
this they judge of ſubſtances, that, firſt tincturing the water with
their vapours, are thus ſent to the noſtrils of the fiſh, and no doubt
produce ſome kind of ſenſation. This moſt probably muſt be the uſe
of that organ in thoſe animals; as otherwiſe there would be the
inſtruments of a ſenſe provided for them, without any power in them of
enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>As to taſting they ſeem to make very little
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; the palate of moſt fiſh is hard and bony, and
conſequently incapable of the powers of reliſhing different ſubſtances.
This ſenſe among quadrupedes, who poſſeſs it in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
ariſes from the ſoft pliancy of the organ, and the delicacy of the ſkin
which covers the inſtruments of taſting; it may be conſidered, in 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0823900106:167"/> them, as a more perfect and delicate kind of feeling: in
the bony palate of fiſh, therefore, all powers of diſtinguiſhing are
utterly taken away; and we have accordingly often ſeen theſe voracious
animals ſwallow the fiſherman's plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met inſtead of the bait.</p>
                  <p>Hearing in fiſhes is found ſtill more imperfect, if it be
found at all. Certain it is, that anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have not been able to
diſcover, except in the whale kind, the ſmalleſt traces of an organ,
either within or without the head of fiſhes. It is true that in the centre of
the brain of ſome fiſhes are found now and then ſome little bones, the
number and ſituation of which are entirely accidental. Theſe bones, Mr.
Klein has ſuppoſed to conſtitute the organ of hearing; but if we
conſider their entire diſſimilitude to the bones that ſerve for hearing
in other animals, we ſhall be of another opinion. The greateſt number of
fiſhes are deprived of theſe bones entirely: ſome fiſh have them in
ſmall numbers, and others in abundance; yet neither teſtify any excellence
or defect in hearing. Indeed, of what advantage would this ſenſe be to
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals that are incapable of making themſelves heard? They have no voice to
communicate with each other, and conſequently have no need of an organ for
hearing. Mr. Gouan, <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0823900106:168"/> who kept ſome gold fiſhes in a
vaſe, informs us, that, whatever noiſe he made, he could neither diſturb
nor terrify them: he hallowed as loud as he could, putting a piece of paper
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his mouth and the water, to prevent the vibrations from affecting the
ſurface, and the fiſhes ſtill ſeemed inſenſible: but when the paper
was removed, and the ſound had its full play upon the water, the fiſhes
ſeemed inſtantly to feel the change, and ſhrunk to the bottom. From this
we may learn, that fiſhes are as deaf as they are mute; and that when they
ſeem to hear the call of a whiſtle or a bell at the edge of a pond, it is
rather the vibrations of the ſound that affect the water, by which they are
excited, than any ſounds that they hear.</p>
                  <p>Seeing ſeems to be the ſenſe fiſhes are
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of in the greateſt degree; and yet even this ſeems
obſcure, if we compare it to that of other animals. The eye, in almoſt all
fiſh, is covered with the ſame tranſparent ſkin that covers the reſt
of the head; and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſerves to defend it in the water, as they
are without eye-lids. The globe is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed anteriorly, and is
furniſhed behind with a muſcle, which ſerves to lengthen or flatten it,
according to the neceſſities of the animal. The chryſtaline humour, which
in quadrupedes is <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0823900106:169"/> flat and of the ſhape of a button
mould, in fiſhes is as round as a pea; or ſometimes oblong, like an egg.
From all this it appears, that fiſh are extremely near-ſighted; and that,
even in the water, they can ſee objects at a very ſmall diſtance. This
diſtance might very eaſily be aſcertained, by comparing the refraction of
bodies in the water, with that formed by a lens that is ſpherical. Thoſe
unſkilled in mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical calculations, will have a general idea of this,
from the glaſſes uſed by near-ſighted people. Thoſe whoſe
chryſtaline humour is too convex, or, in other words, too round, are always
very near-ſighted; and obliged to uſe concave glaſſes, to correct the
imperfections of Nature. The chryſtaline humour of fiſh is ſo round that
it is not in the power of any glaſſes, much leſs of water, to correct
their viſion. This chryſtaline humour in fiſhes all muſt have ſeen;
being that little hard pea-like ſubſtance which is found in their eyes
after boiling. In the natural ſtate it is tranſparent, and not much harder
than a jelly.</p>
                  <p>From all this, it appears how far fiſh fall behind
terreſtrial animals in their ſenſations, and conſequently in their
enjoyments. Even their brain, which is by ſome ſuppoſed to be of a ſize
with every animal's underſtanding, ſhews <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0823900106:170"/> that fiſh
are inferior even to birds in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. It is divided into three parts,
ſurrounded with a whitiſh froth, and gives off nerves as well to the
ſenſe of ſight as of ſmelling. In ſome fiſh it is grey, in others
white; in ſome it is flatted, in others round; but in all extremely ſmall,
compared to the bulk of the animal.</p>
                  <p>Thus Nature ſeems to have fitted theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals with
appetites and powers of an inferior kind; and formed them for a ſort of
paſſive exiſtence in the obſcure and heavy element to which they are
conſigned. To preſerve their own exiſtence, and to continue it to their
poſterity, fill up the whole circle of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and enjoyments; to
theſe they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled rather by neceſſity than choice, and ſeem
mechanically excited to every fruition. Their ſenſes are incapable of
making any diſtinctions; but they drive forward in purſuit of whatever they
can ſwallow, conquer, or enjoy.</p>
                  <p>A ceaſeleſs deſire of food ſeems to give the ruling
impulſe to all their motions. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite impels them to encounter every
danger; and indeed their rapacity ſeems inſatiable. Even when taken out of
the water, and almoſt expire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they greedily ſwallow the very bait by
which they were allured to deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The maw is, in general, placed next the <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0823900106:171"/>
mouth; and though poſſeſſed of no ſenſible heat, is however endued
with a ſurprizing faculty of digeſtion. Its digeſtive power ſeems, in
ſome meaſure, to encreaſe with the quantity of food it is ſupplied
with; a ſingle pike having been known to devour an hundred roaches in three
days. Its faculties alſo are as extraordinary; for it digeſts not only
fiſh, but much harder ſubſtances; prawns, crabs, and lobſters, ſhells
and all. Theſe the cod or the ſturgeon will not only devour, but
diſſolve down, though their ſhells are ſo much harder than the ſides
of the ſtomach which contains them. This amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty in the cold maw of
fiſhes has juſtly excited the curioſity of philoſophers; and has
effectually overturned the ſyſtem of thoſe, who ſuppoſed that the
heat of the ſtomach was alone a ſufficient inſtrument for digeſtion.
The truth ſeems to be, and ſome experiments of the ſkilful Dr. Hunter
ſeem to evince, that there is a power of animal aſſimilation lodged in
the ſtomach of all creatures, which we can neither deſcribe nor define,
converting the ſubſtances they ſwallow into a fluid fitted for their own
peculiar ſupport. This is done neither by trituration, nor by warmth, nor by
motion, nor by a diſſolving fluid, nor by their united efforts; but by
ſome principle in the ſtomach yet unknown, which <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0823900106:172"/>
acts in a different manner from all kinds of artificial maceration. The meat
taken into the ſtomach or maw is often ſeen, though very near being
digeſted, ſtill to retain its original form; and ready for a total
diſſolution, while it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the eye as yet untouched by the force of
the ſtomach. This animal power is lodged in the maw of fiſhes, in a greater
degree than in any other creatures; their digeſtive powers are quick, and
their appetites ever are craving.</p>
                  <p>Yet, though fiſh are thus hungry, and for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ever prowling, no
animals can ſuffer the want of food for ſo long a time. The gold and
ſilver fiſh we keep in vaſes ſeem never to want any nouriſhment at
all; whether it be that they feed on the water-inſects, too minute for our
obſervation, or that water alone is a ſufficient ſupply, is not evident;
but they are often ſeen for months without apparent ſuſtenance. Even the
pike, the moſt voracious of fiſhes, will live in a pond where there is none
but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and, what is more extraordinary, will be often found to thrive
there.</p>
                  <p>Still, however, fiſh are of all other animals the moſt
voracious and inſatiable. Whatever any of them is able to ſwallow
poſſeſſed of life, ſeems to be conſidered as the moſt deſirable
food. Some that have very ſmall mouths feed <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0823900106:173"/> upon worms
and the ſpawn of other fiſh: others, whoſe mouths are larger, ſeek
larger prey; it matters not of what kind, whether of another or their own.
Thoſe with the largeſt mouths purſue almoſt every thing that has life;
and often meet each other in fierce oppoſition, when the fiſh with the
largeſt ſwallow comes off with the victory, and devours its
antagoniſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus are they irritated by the continual deſire of
ſatisfying their hunger; and the life of a fiſh, from the ſmalleſt to
the greateſt, is but one ſcene of hoſtility, violence and evaſion. But
the ſmaller fry ſtand no chance in the unequal combat; and their uſual
way of eſcaping, is by ſwimming into thoſe ſhallows where the greater
are unable or too heavy to purſue. There they become invaders in turn, and
live upon the ſpawn of larger fiſh, which they find floating upon the
ſurface of the water: yet there are dangers attending them in every place.
Even in the ſhallows, the muſcle, the oyſter, and the ſcallop, lie in
ambuſh at the bottom, with their ſhells open, and whatever little fiſh
inadvertently approaches into contact, they at once cloſe their ſhells upon
him, and devour the impriſoned prey at their leiſure.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the purſuit of fiſhes, like that of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
animals, confined to a ſingle region, or <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0823900106:174"/> to one
effort: ſhoals of one ſpecies follow thoſe of another through vaſts
tracts of ocean, from the vicinity of the pole even down to the equator. Thus
the cod, from the banks of Newfoundland, purſues the whiting, which flies
before it even to the ſouthern ſhores of Spain. The cachalot is ſaid, in
the ſame manner, to purſue a ſhoal of herrings, and to ſwallow
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands at a gulp.</p>
                  <p>This may be one cauſe of the annual mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of fiſhes
from one part of the ocean to the other; but there are other motives, which
come in aid of this alſo. Fiſhes may be induced to change the place of
their reſidence, for one more ſuited to their conſtitutions, or more
adapted to depoſiting their ſpawn. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that no fiſh are
fond of very cold waters, and generally frequent thoſe places where it is
warmeſt. Thus, in ſummer, they are ſeen in great numbers in the
ſhallows near the ſhore, where the ſun has power to warm the water to the
bottom; on the contrary, in winter, they are found towards the bottom in the
deep ſea, for the cold of the atmoſphere is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently penetrating
to reach them at thoſe great depths. Cold produces the ſame effect upon
freſh-water fiſhes; and when they are often ſeen dead after ſevere
froſts, it is moſt probable that <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0823900106:175"/> they have been
killed by the ſeverity of the cold, as well as by their being excluded by the
ice from air.</p>
                  <p>All fiſh live in the water; yet they all ſtand in need of
air for their ſupport. Thoſe of the whale kind, indeed, breathe the air in
the ſame manner as we do, and come to the ſurface every two or three
minutes to take a freſh inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but thoſe which continue entirely
under water, are yet under a neceſſity of being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with air, or
they will expire in a very few minutes. We ſometimes ſee all the fiſh of
a pond killed, when the ice every where covers the ſurface of the water, and
thus keeps off the air from the ſubjacent fluid. If a hole be made in the
ice, the fiſh will be ſeen to come all to that part, in order to take the
benefit of a freſh ſupply. Should a carp, in a large vaſe of water, be
placed under an air-pump, and then be deprived of its air, during the operation
a number of bubbles will be ſeen ſtanding upon the ſurface of the
fiſh's body; ſoon after the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal will appear to breathe ſwifter and
with greater difficulty; it will then be ſeen to riſe towards the ſurface
to get more air; the bubbles on its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face begin to diſappear; the belly,
that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſwolen, will then fall of a ſudden, and the animal ſinks
expiring and convulſed at the bottom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0823900106:176"/>So very neceſſary is air to all
animals, but particularly to fiſh, that, as was ſaid, they can live but a
few minutes without it: yet nothing is more difficult to be accounted for, than
the manner in which they obtain this neceſſary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Thoſe who have
ſeen a fiſh in the water, muſt remember the motion of its lips and its
gills, or at leaſt of the bones on each ſide that cover them. This motion
in the animal is, without doubt, analogous to our breathing; but it is not air,
but water, that the fiſh actually ſucks in and ſpouts out through the
gills at every motion. The manner of its breathing is thus: the fiſh firſt
takes a quantity of water by the mouth, which is driven to the gills; theſe
cloſe and keep the water ſo ſwallowed from returning by the mouth; while
the bony covering of the gills prevents it from going through them, until the
animal has drawn the proper quantity of air from the body of water thus
impriſoned: then the bony covers open and give it a free paſſage; by
which means alſo the gills again are opened and admit a freſh quantity of
water. Should the fiſh be prevented from the free play of its gills, or
ſhould the bony covers be kept from moving, by a ſtring tied round them,
the animal would ſoon fall into convulſions and die in a few minutes.</p>
                  <p>But though this be the general method of <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0823900106:177"/> explaining reſpiration in fiſhes, the difficulty remains to know
what is done with this air, which the fiſh in this manner ſeparates from
the water. There ſeems no receptacle for containing it; the ſtomach being
the chief cavity within the body, is too much filled with aliment for that
purpoſe. There is indeed a cavity, and that a pretty large one, I mean the
air-bladder or ſwim, which may ſerve to contain it for vital purpoſes;
but that our philoſophers have long deſtined to a very different uſe. The
uſe univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally aſſigned to the air-bladder is the enabling the fiſh
to riſe or ſink in the water at pleaſure, as that is dilated or
compreſſed. The uſe aſſigned by the ancients for it was to come in
aid of the lungs, and to remain as a kind of ſtore-houſe of air to ſupply
the animal in its neceſſities. I own my attachment to this laſt opinion;
but let us exhibit both with their proper ſhare of evidence, and the reader
muſt be left to determine.</p>
                  <p>The air-bladder is deſcribed as a bag filled with air,
ſometimes compoſed of one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of two, and ſometimes of three
diviſions, ſituated towards the back of the fiſh, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the
maw or the gullet. Thoſe who contend that this bag is deſigned for
raiſing or depreſſing the fiſh in the water, build upon the following
experiment. A carp being put into the <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0823900106:178"/> air-pump, and the
air exhauſted, the bladder is ſaid to expand itſelf to ſuch a degree,
that the fiſh ſwells in an extraordinary manner till the bladder burſts,
and then the fiſh ſinks, and ever after continues to crawl at the bottom.
On ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, the air-bladder was pricked and wounded, which let out
its air; upon which the fiſh funk to the bottom, and was not ſeen to riſe
after. From thence it is inferred, that the uſe of the air-bladder muſt be
by ſwelling at the will of the animal, thus to encreaſe the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of
the fiſh's body, and thence diminiſhing its ſpecific gravity, to enable
it to riſe to the top of the water, and keep there at pleaſure. On the
contrary, when the fiſh wants to deſcend, it is, ſay they, but to
exhauſt this bladder of its air; and the fiſh being thus rendered ſlimmer
and heavier, conſequently ſinks to the bottom.</p>
                  <p>Such is the account given of the uſe of the air-bladder; no
part of which ſeems to me well ſupported. In the firſt place, though
nothing is more certain, than that a carp put into the air-pump will ſwell,
yet ſo will a mouſe or a frog; and theſe we know to have no
air-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. A carp will riſe to the ſurface: but ſo will all fiſh
that want air, whether they have an air-bladder or not. The air-bladder is
ſaid to burſt in the experiment; but that I deny. The <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0823900106:179"/> air-bladder is indeed found empty, but it has ſuffered no
laceration, and may be diſtended by being blown into like any other bladder
that is ſound. The fiſh after the experiment, I grant, continues to creep
at the bottom; and ſo will all fiſh that are ſick and wounded, which
muſt be the caſe with this after ſuch an operation. Thus theſe facts
prove nothing, but that when the fiſh is killed in an air-pump the
air-bladder is found exhauſted; and that it will naturally and
neceſſarily be; for the drain of air by which the fiſh is ſupplied in
the natural way will neceſſarily oblige it to make uſe of all its hidden
ſtores; and, as there is a communication between the gullet and the
air-bladder, the air which the latter contains will thus be obviouſly drawn
away. But ſtill farther, how comes the air-bladder, according to their
hypotheſis, to ſwell under the experiment of the air-pump? What is it that
cloſes the aperture of that organ in ſuch a manner as at laſt to burſt
it; or what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity has the fiſh for dilating it to that violent
degree? At moſt, it only wants to riſe to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; and that the
fiſh can eaſily do without ſo great a diſtention of the air-bladder.
Indeed, it ſhould rather ſeem, that the more the air was wanted without,
the leſs neceſſity there was for its being uſeleſsly accumulated
within; and to <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0823900106:180"/> make the modern ſyſtem
conſiſtent, the fiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the air-pump, inſtead of permitting its
bladder to be burſt, would readily give up its contents; which, upon their
ſuppoſition, all can do at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, the fiſh can neither encreaſe nor
diminiſh the quantity of air in its air-bladder at will, no more than we can
that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our ſtomachs. The animal has no one muſcle,
much leſs pair of muſcles, for contracting or dilating this organ; its
aperture is from the gullet; and what air is put into it muſt remain there
till the neceſſities, and not the will, of the animal call it forth as a
ſupply.</p>
                  <p>But, to put the matter paſt a doubt, many fiſh are
furniſhed with an air-bladder that continually crawl at the bottom; ſuch as
the eel and the flounder; and many more are entirely without any bladder, that
ſwim at eaſe in every depth; ſuch as the anchovy and freſh-water
gudgeon<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Redi.</bibl>
                     </note>. Indeed, the number
of fiſh that want this organ is alone a ſufficient proof that it is not
ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the purpoſes of ſwimming; and as the ventral fins,
which in all fiſh lie flat upon the water, ſeem fully ſufficient to keep
them at all depths, I ſee no great occaſion for this internal
philoſophical apparatus for raiſing and depreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0823900106:181"/> them. Upon the whole, the air-bladder ſeems adapted for different
purpoſes than that of keeping the fiſh at different depths in the water;
but whether it be to ſupply them with air when it is wanted from without, or
for what other purpoſe, I will not take upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have ſeen fiſh in every reſpect inferior to
land animals; in the ſimplicity of their conformation, in their ſenſes,
and their enjoyments; but of that humble exiſtence which they have been
granted by nature, they have a longer term than any other claſs of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
nature. 
<q rend="inline">"Moſt of the diſorders incident to
mankind," ſays Bacon, "ariſe from the changes and alterations of the
atmoſphere; but fiſhes reſide in an element little ſubject to change;
theirs is an uniform exiſtence; their movements are without effort, and their
life without labour. Their bones alſo, which are united by cartilages, admit
of indefinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion; and the different ſizes of animals of the ſame
kind among fiſhes is very various. They ſtill keep growing; their bodies,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſuffering the rigidity of age, which is the cauſe of natural
decay in land animals, ſtill continue encreaſing with freſh ſupplies;
and as the body grows the conduits of life furniſh their ſtores in greater
abundance. <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0823900106:182"/> How long a fiſh that ſeems to have
ſcarce any bounds put to its growth continues to live is not aſcertained;
perhaps the life of a man would not be long enough to meaſure that of the
ſmalleſt."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There have been two methods deviſed for determining the age
of fiſhes, which are more ingenious than certain; the one is by the circles
of the ſcales, the other by the tranſverſe ſection of the back-bone.
The firſt method is this. When a fiſh's ſcale is examined through a
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope, it will be found to conſiſt of a number of circles, one
circle within another, in ſome meaſure reſembling thoſe which appear
upon the tranſverſe ſection of a tree, and ſuppoſed to offer the
ſame information. For as in trees we can tell their age by the number of
their circles, ſo in fiſhes we can tell theirs by the number of circles in
every ſcale, reckoning one ring for every year of the animal's exiſtence.
By this method, Mr. Buffon found a carp, whoſe ſcales he examined, to be
not leſs than a hundred years old; a thing almoſt incredible had we not
ſeveral accounts in other authors which tend to confirm the diſcovery.
Geſner brings us an inſtance of one of the ſame age; and Albertus of one
more than double that period.</p>
                  <p>The age of the ſkate and the ray, that want ſcales, may be
known by the other method; <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0823900106:183"/> which is, by ſeparating the
joints of the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, and then minutely obſerving the number of rings
which the ſurface where it was joined exhibits. By this the fiſh's age is
ſaid to be known; and perhaps with as much certainty as in the former
inſtance.</p>
                  <p>But how unſatisfactory ſoever theſe marks may be, we
have no reaſon to doubt the great age of ſome fiſhes. Thoſe that have
ponds often know the oldeſt by their ſuperior ſize. But the longevity of
theſe animals is nothing when compared to their fecundity. All ſorts, a few
of the larger ones excepted, multiply their kind ſome by hundreds and ſome
by millions. There are ſome that bring forth their young alive, and ſome
that only produce eggs: the former are rather the leaſt fruitful: yet even
theſe are ſeen to produce in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. The viviparous blenny, for
inſtance, brings forth two or three hundred at a time, all alive and playing
round the parent together. Thoſe who exclude their progeny in a more
imperfect ſtate, and produce eggs, which they are obliged to leave to chance,
either on the bottom at the edge of the water, or floating on the ſurface
where it is deeper, are all much more prolific; and ſeem to proportion their
ſtock to the danger there is of its conſumption. Of <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0823900106:184"/>
theſe eggs thus depoſited, ſcarce one in an hundred brings forth an
animal; they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by all the leſſer fry that frequent the
ſhores; by aquatic birds near the margin, and by the larger fiſh in deep
water. Still, however, there are enough for ſupplying the deep with
inhabitants; and, notwithſtanding their own ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and that of the fowls
of various tribes, the numbers that eſcape are ſufficient to relieve the
wants of a very conſiderable part of mankind. Indeed, when we conſider the
numbers that a ſingle fiſh is capable of producing, the amount will ſeem
aſtoniſhing. If, for inſtance, we ſhould be told of a being ſo very
prolific, that in a ſingle ſeaſon it could bring forth as many of its
kind as there are inhabitants in England, it would ſtrike us with ſurprize;
yet a ſingle cod produces full that number. The cod ſpawns in one
ſeaſon, as Lewenhoeck aſſures us, above nine million of eggs or peas
contained in one ſingle roe. The flounder is commonly known to produce above
one million; and the mackarel above five hundred thouſand. Such an amazing
encreaſe, if permitted to come to maturity, would overſtock nature, and
even the ocean itſelf would not be able to contain, much leſs to provide
for, the half of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. But two wiſe purpoſes are anſwered by
this amazing encreaſe; it preſerves the ſpecies <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0823900106:185"/> in
the midſt of numberleſs enemies, and ſerves to furniſh the reſt with
a ſuſtenance adapted to their nature.</p>
                  <p>Fiſhes ſeem, all except the whale-kind, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
diveſted of thoſe parental ſolicitudes which ſo ſtrongly mark the
manners of the more perfect terreſtrial animals. How far they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate
remains as yet a doubt; for though they ſeem to join, yet the male is not
furniſhed with any external inſtrument of generation. It is ſaid, by
ſome, that his only end in that action is to emit his impregnating milt upon
the eggs that at that time fall from the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. He is ſaid to be ſeen
purſuing them as they float down the ſtream, and carefully impregnating
them one after another. On ſome occaſions alſo the females dig holes in
the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of rivers and ponds, and there depoſit their ſpawn, which is
impregnated by the male in the ſame manner. All this, however, is very
doubtful; what we know with certainty of the matter, and that not diſcovered
till very lately, is, that the male has two organs of generation that open into
the bladder of urine, and that theſe organs do not open into the rectum as in
birds, but have a particular aperture of their own<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Vide Gaman de Generatione Piſcium.</bibl>
                     </note>. Theſe
organs of generation in the male are <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0823900106:186"/> empty at ſome
ſeaſons of the year; but before the time of ſpawing they are turgid with
what is called the milt, and emit the fluid proper for impregnation.</p>
                  <p>Fiſh have different ſeaſons for depoſiting their
ſpawn: ſome, that live in the depths of the ocean, are ſaid to chuſe
the winter months; but, in general, thoſe with which we are acquainted,
chuſe the hotteſt months in ſummer, and prefer ſuch water as is
ſomewhat tepefied by the beams of the ſun. They then leave the deepeſt
parts of the ocean, which are the coldeſt, and ſhoal round the coaſts, or
ſwim up the freſh-water rivers, which are warm as they are comparatively
ſhallow. When they have depoſited their burthens, they then return to their
old ſtations, and leave their naſcent progeny to ſhift for
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The ſpawn continues in its egg-ſtate in ſome fiſh
longer than in others, and this in proportion to the animal's ſize. In the
ſalmon, for inſtance, the young animal continues in the egg from the
beginning of December till the beginning of April; the carp continues in the
egg not above three weeks; the little gold fiſh from China is produced
ſtill quicker. Theſe all, when excluded, at firſt eſcape by their
minuteneſs and agility. They riſe, ſink, and turn much readier than grown
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0823900106:187"/> fiſh; and they can eſcape into very ſhallow waters
when purſued. But, with all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſcarce one in a thouſand
ſurvives the numerous perils of its youth. The very male and female that have
given them birth, are equally dangerous and formidable with the reſt,
forgetting all relation at their departure.</p>
                  <p>Such is the general picture of theſe heedleſs and hungry
creatures: but there are ſome in this claſs, living in the waters, that are
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of finer organs and higher ſenſations; that have all the
tenderneſs of birds or quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes for their young; that nurſe them with
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant care, and protect them from every injury. Of this claſs are the
<hi>Cetaceous</hi> tribe, or the fiſhes of the whale-kind. There are others,
though not capable of nurſing their young, yet that bring them alive into the
world, and defend them with courage and activity. Theſe are the
<hi>Cartilaginous</hi> kinds, or thoſe who have griſtles inſtead of
bones. But the fierce unmindful tribe we have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, that leave
their ſpawn without any protection, are called the <hi>Spinous</hi> or bony
kinds, from their bones reſembling the ſharpneſs of thorns.</p>
                  <p>Thus there are three grand diviſions in the fiſh-kind: the
<hi>cetaceous,</hi> the <hi>cartilaginous,</hi> and the <hi>ſpinous</hi>; all
differing from each other in <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0823900106:188"/> their conformation, their
appetites, in their bringing forth, and in the education of their young.
Theſe three great diſtinctions are not the capricious differences formed by
a maker of ſyſtems, but are ſtrongly and firmly marked in nature. Theſe
are the diſtinctions of Ariſtotle; and they have been adopted by mankind
ever ſince his time. It will be neceſſary, therefore, to give the
hiſtory of each of theſe in particular; and then to range under each head,
thoſe fiſhes whoſe hiſtory is the moſt remarkable; or, more properly
ſpeaking, thoſe of which we have any hiſtory. For we ſhall find, when
we come to any of the ſpecies in particular, how little can be ſaid of
their habits, their ſtations, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of propagation.</p>
                  <p>Much, indeed, can be ſaid of them, if conſidered
relatively to man; and large books have been written of the manner of taking
fiſh; or of dreſſing them. Apicius is noted for having firſt taught
mankind to ſuffocate fiſh in Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian pickle; and Quin for giving a
ſauce to the Johndory: Mrs. Glaſs is famous for her eel pie, and Mr. Tull
for his invention of ſpay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carp to give it a finer flavour. In this manner
our cooks handle the ſubject. On the other hand, our phyſicians aſſure
us that the fleſh of fiſhes yields little nouriſhment, and ſoon
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts; <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0823900106:189"/> that it abounds in a groſs ſort of oil
and water, and hath but few volatile particles, which renders it leſs fit to
be converted into the ſubſtance of our bodies. They are cold and moiſt,
and muſt needs, ſay they, produce juices of the ſame kind, and
conſequently are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to ſtrengthen the body. In this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of
opinion, it is the wiſeſt way to eat our fiſh in the ordinary manner, and
pay no great attention to cooks or doctors.</p>
                  <p>I cannot conclude this chapter without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a queſtion
to the learned which, I confeſs, I am not able to reſolve. How comes it
that fiſh which are bred in a ſalt element have yet no ſalt to the
taſte, or that is capable of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from it?</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of Cetaceous Fiſhes in General.</head>
                  <p>AS on land there are ſome orders of animals that ſeem
formed to command the reſt, with greater powers and more various inſtincts,
ſo in the ocean there are fiſhes which ſeem formed upon a nobler plan
than others, and that, to their fiſhy form, join the appetites and the
conformation of quadrupedes. Theſe all are of the <hi>cetaceous</hi> kind;
and ſo much raiſed above their fellows of the deep, in their appetites and
inſtincts, that almoſt all our modern naturaliſts have fairly excluded
them from the finny tribes, and will have them called, not fiſhes, but, great
beaſts of the ocean. With them it would be as improper to ſay men go to
Greenland fiſhing for whale, as it would be to ſay that a ſportſman
goes to Blackwall a fowling for mackarel.</p>
                  <p>Yet, notwithſtanding philoſophers, mankind will always
have their own way of talking; and for my own part I think them here in the
right. A different formation of the lungs, ſtomach and inteſtines, a
different manner of breathing or propagating, are not ſufficient to
counterbalance the great obvious analogy which <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0823900106:191"/> theſe
animals bear to the whole finny tribe. They are ſhaped as other fiſhes;
they ſwim with fins; they are entirely naked, without hair; they live in the
water, though they come up to breathe; they are only ſeen in the depths of
the ocean, and never come upon ſhore but when forced thither. Theſe ſure
are ſufficient to plead in favour of the general denomination, and acquit
mankind of error in ranking them with their lower companions of the deep.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill they are as many degrees raiſed above other
fiſhes in their nature, as they are in general in their ſize. This tribe is
compoſed of the Whale and its varieties, of the Cachalot, the Dolphin, the
Grampus, and the Porpeſs. All theſe reſemble quadrupedes in their
internal ſtructure, and in ſome of their appetites and affections. Like
quadrupedes, they have lungs, a midriff, a ſtomach, inteſtines, liver,
ſpleen, bladder, and parts of generation; their heart alſo reſembles that
of quadrupedes, with its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cloſed up as in them, and driving red
and warm blood in circulation through the body. In ſhort, every internal part
bears a moſt ſtriking ſimilitude; and to keep theſe parts warm, the
whole kind are alſo covered between the ſkin and the muſcles with a thick
coat of fat or blubber, which, like the bacon-fat of an hog, 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0823900106:192"/> keeps out the cold, renders their muſcles glib and
pliant, and probably makes them lighter in ſwimming.</p>
                  <p>As theſe animals breathe the air, it is obvious that they
cannot bear to be any long time under water. They are conſtrained, therefore,
every two or three minutes, to come up to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to take breath, as
well as to ſpout out through their noſtril, for they have but one, that
water which they ſucked in while gaping for their prey. This conduit, by
which they breathe, and alſo throw out the water, is placed in the head, a
little before the brain. Though externally the hole is but ſingle, it is
internally divided by a bony partition, which is cloſed by a ſphincter
muſcle on the inſide, that, like the mouth of a purſe, ſhuts it up at
the pleaſure of the animal. There is alſo another muſcle or valve, which
prevents the water from going down the gullet. When therefore the animal takes
in a certain quantity of water, which is neceſſary to be diſcharged and
ſeparated from its food, it ſhuts the mouth, cloſes the valve of the
ſtomach, opens the ſphincter that kept the noſtril cloſed, and then
breathing ſtrongly from the lungs, puſhes the water out by the effort, as
we ſee it riſe by the preſſure of air in a fire-engine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0823900106:193"/>The ſenſes of theſe animals ſeem
alſo ſuperior to thoſe of other fiſhes. The eyes of other fiſhes, we
have obſerved, are covered only with that tranſparent ſkin that covers
the reſt of the head; but in all the cetaceous kinds, it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by
eye-lids, as in man. This, no doubt, keeps that organ in a more perfect
ſtate, by giving it intervals of relaxation, in which all viſion is
ſuſpended. The other fiſhes, that are for ever ſtaring, muſt ſee,
if for no other reaſon, more feebly, as their organs of ſight are always
exerted.</p>
                  <p>As for hearing, theſe alſo are furniſhed with the
internal inſtruments of the ear, although the external orifice no where
appears. It is moſt probable that this orifice may open by ſome canal,
reſembling the Euſtachian tube, into the mouth; but this has not as yet
been diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Yet Nature ſure has not thus formed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete apparatus
for hearing, and denied the animal the uſe of it when formed. It is moſt
likely that all animals of the cetaceous kind can hear, as they certainly utter
ſounds, and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to each other. This vocal power would be as needleſs to
animals naturally deaf, as glaſſes to a man that was blind.</p>
                  <p>But it is in the circumſtances in which they continue their
kind, that theſe animals ſhew an <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0823900106:194"/> eminent
ſuperiority. Other fiſh depoſit their ſpawn, and leave the ſucceſs
to accident: theſe never produce above one young, or two at the moſt; and
this the female ſuckles entirely in the manner of quadrupedes, her breaſts
being placed, as in the human kind, above the navel. We have read many fabulous
accounts of the nurſing of the demigods of antiquity, of their feeding on the
marrow of lions, and their being ſuckled by wolves; one might imagine a
ſtill more heroic ſyſtem of nutrition, if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the young
hero was ſuckled and grew ſtrong upon the breaſt-milk of a
ſhe-whale.</p>
                  <p>The whale or the grampus are terrible at any time; but are
fierce and deſperate in the defence of their young. In Waller's beautiful
poem of the Summer Iſlands, we have a ſtory, founded upon fact, which
ſhews the maternal tenderneſs of theſe animals for their offspring. A
whale and her cub had got into an arm of the ſea, where, by the deſertion
of the tide, they were encloſed on every ſide. The people from ſhore
ſoon ſaw their ſituation, and drove down upon them in boats, with ſuch
weapons as the urgent occaſion offered. The two animals were ſoon wounded
in ſeveral places, and the whole ſea round was tinctured with their blood.
The whales made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral attempts to eſcape; and at laſt the old one, 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0823900106:195"/> by its ſuperior ſtrength, forced over the ſhallow,
into the depths of the ocean. But though in ſafety herſelf, ſhe could not
bear the danger that awaited her young one; ſhe therefore ruſhed in once
more where the ſmaller animal was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and reſolved, when ſhe
could not protect, at leaſt to ſhare his danger.—The ſtory ends
with poetical juſtice; for the tide coming in, brought off both in ſafety
from their enemies, though not without ſuſtaining an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of
wounds in every part.</p>
                  <p>As to the reſt, the diſtinctive marks of this tribe are,
that the number of their fins never exceeds three; namely, two pectoral fins,
and one back fin; but in ſome ſorts the laſt is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Theſe fins
differ very much from thoſe of other fiſhes, which are formed of ſtraight
ſpines: the fins of the cetaceous tribe are made up of bones and muſcles;
and the ſkeleton of one of their fins, very much reſembles the ſkeleton
of a man's hand. Their tails alſo are different from thoſe of all other
fiſh: they are placed ſo as to lie flat on the ſurface of the water;
while the other kinds have them, as we every day ſee, upright or edgeways.
This flat poſition of the tail in cetaceous animals, enables them to force
themſelves ſuddenly to the ſurface of the water to breathe, which they
are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually conſtrained to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0823900106:196"/>Of theſe enormous animals, ſome are
without teeth, and properly called whales; others have the teeth only in the
lower jaw, and are called, by the French, cachalots: the narwhal has teeth only
in the upper jaw: the dolphin's teeth, as well as thoſe of the porpeſs and
grampus, are both above and below. Theſe are the marks that ſerve to
diſtinguiſh the kinds of this enormous tribe from each other; and theſe
ſhall ſerve to guide us, in giving their hiſtory.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the Whale, properly ſo called, and its
Varieties.</head>
                  <p>IF we compare land animals, in reſpect to magnitude, with
thoſe of the deep, they will appear contemptible in the competition. It is
probable, indeed, that quadrupedes once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted much larger than we find
them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. From the ſkeletons of ſome that have been dug up at
different times, it is evident, that there muſt have been terreſtrial
animals twice as large as the elephant; but creatures of ſuch an immenſe
bulk required a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able extent of ground for ſubſiſtence, and, by
being rivals with men for large territory, they muſt have been deſtroyed in
the conteſt.</p>
                  <p>But it is not only upon land that man has exerted his power of
deſtroying the larger tribes of animated nature, he has extended his efforts
even into the midſt of the ocean, and has cut off numbers of thoſe enormous
animals that had perhaps exiſted for ages. We now no longer hear of whales
two hundred, and two hundred and fifty, feet long, which we are certain were
often ſeen about two centuries ago. They have all <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0823900106:198"/> been
deſtroyed by the ſkill of mankind, and the ſpecies is now dwindled into a
race of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive animals, from thirty to about eighty feet long.</p>
                  <p>The northern ſeas were once the region to which the
greateſt of theſe animals reſorted; but ſo great has been the
ſlaughter of whales for more than two ages, that they begin to grow thinner
every day; and thoſe that are found there, ſeem, from their ſize, not
come to their full dimenſions. The greateſt whales reſort to places where
they have the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance; to thoſe ſeas that are on the
oppoſite ſide of the globe, near the ſouth pole. In that part of the
world, there are ſtill to be ſeen whales that are above an hundred and
ſixty feet long; and perhaps even longer might be found in thoſe latitudes
near the ſouth pole, to which we have not as yet ventured.</p>
                  <p>Taking the whale, however, at the ordinary ſize of eighty
feet long and twenty feet high, what an enormous animated maſs muſt it
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the ſpectator! With what amazement muſt it ſtrike him, to
behold ſo great a creature gambolling in the deep, with the eaſe and
agility of the ſmalleſt animal, and making its way with incredible
ſwiftneſs! This is a ſight which is very common to thoſe who frequent
the northern or <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0823900106:199"/> ſouthern ocean. Yet though this be
wonderful, perhaps ſtill greater wonders are concealed in the deep, which we
have not had opportunities of exploring. Theſe large animals are obliged to
ſhew themſelves in order to take breath; but who knows the ſize of
thoſe that are fitted to remain for ever under water; and that have been
encreaſing in magnitude for centuries? To believe all that has been ſaid of
the ſea-ſerpent, or the Kraken, would be credulity; to reject the
poſſibility of their exiſtence, would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                  <p>The Whale is the largeſt animal of which we have any certain
information; and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious purpoſes to which, when taken, its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts are converted, have brought us tolerably acquainted with its hiſtory.
Of the whale, properly ſo called, there are no leſs than ſeven different
kinds; all diſtinguiſhed from each other by their external figure, or
internal conformation. The Great Greenland Whale, without a back-fin, and black
on the back; the Iceland Whale, without a back-fin, and whitiſh on the back;
the New England Whale, with a hump on the back; the Whale with ſix humps on
the back; the Fin-fiſh, with a fin on the back near the tail; the Pike-headed
Whale, and the Round-lipped Whale. All theſe differ <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0823900106:200"/>
from each other in figure, as their names obviouſly imply. They differ alſo
ſomewhat in their manner of living; the fin-fiſh having a larger ſwallow
than the reſt, being more active, ſlender and fierce, and living chiefly
upon herrings. However, they are none of them very voracious; and, if compared
to the Cachalot, that enormous tyrant of the deep, they appear harmleſs and
gentle. The hiſtory of the reſt, therefore, may be comprized under that of
the Great Common Greenland Whale, with which we are beſt acquainted.</p>
                  <p>The Great Greenland Whale is the fiſh for taking which there
are ſuch preparations made in different parts of Europe. It is a large heavy
animal, and the head alone makes a third of its bulk. It is uſually found
from ſixty to ſeventy feet long. The fins on each ſide are from five to
eight feet, compoſed of bones and muſcles, and ſufficiently ſtrong to
give the great maſs of body which they move, ſpeed and activity. The tail,
which lies flat on the water, is about twenty-four feet broad; and, when the
fiſh lies on one ſide, its blow is tremendous. The ſkin is ſmooth and
black, and, in ſome places, marbled with white and yellow; which, running
over the ſurface, has a very beautiful effect. This marbling is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
obſervable in the fins and the tail. In <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0823900106:201"/> the figures
which are thus drawn by Nature, fancy often forms the pictures of trees,
land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes and houſes. In the tail of one that was thus marbled, Ray tells
us that the number 122 was figured very evenly and exact, as if done with a
pencil.</p>
                  <p>The whale makes uſe only of the tail to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance itſelf
forward in the water. This ſerves as a great oar to puſh its maſs along;
and it is ſurprizing to ſee with what force and celerity its enormous bulk
cuts through the ocean. The fins are only made uſe of for turning in the
water, and giving a direction to the velocity impreſſed by the tail. The
female alſo makes uſe of them, when purſued, to bear off her young,
clapping them on her back, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them by the fins on each ſide
from falling.</p>
                  <p>The outward or ſcarf ſkin of the whale is no thicker than
parchment; but this removed, the real ſkin appears, of about an inch thick,
and covering the fat or blubber that lies beneath: this is from eight to twelve
inches in thickneſs; and is, when the fiſh is in health, of a beautiful
yellow. The muſcles lie beneath; and theſe, like the fleſh of
quadrupedes, are very red and tough.</p>
                  <p>The cleft of the mouth is above twenty feet 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0823900106:202"/> long, which is near one third of the animal's whole
length; and the upper jaw is furniſhed with barbs, that lie, like the pipes
of an organ, the greateſt in the middle, and the ſmalleſt to the ſides.
Theſe compoſe the whale-bone; the longeſt ſpars of which are found to
be not leſs than eighteen feet: the ſhorteſt, being of no value, are
thrown away. The tongue is almoſt immovably fixed to the lower jaw, ſeeming
one great lump of fat; and, in fact, it fills ſeveral hogſheads with
blubber. The eyes are not larger than thoſe of an ox; and when the
chryſtaline humour is dried, it does not appear larger than a pea. They are
placed towards the back of the head, being the moſt convenient ſituation
for enabling them to ſee both before and behind; as alſo to ſee over
them, where their food is principally found. They are guarded by eye-lids and
eye-laſhes, as in quadrupedes; and they ſeem to be very
ſharp-ſighted.</p>
                  <p>Nor is their ſenſe of hearing in leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for
they are warned, at great diſtances, of any danger preparing againſt them.
It would ſeem as if Nature had deſignedly given them theſe advantages, as
they multiply little, in order to continue their kind. It is true indeed, that
the external organ of hearing is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0823900106:203"/> for
this might only embarraſs them in their natural element; but as ſoon as the
thin ſcarf ſkin abovementioned is removed, a black ſpot is diſcovered
behind the eye, and under that is the auditory canal, that leads to a regular
apparatus for hearing. In ſhort, the animal hears the ſmalleſt ſounds
at very great diſtances, and at all times, except when it is ſpouting
water; which is the time that the fiſhers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to ſtrike it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſpout-holes or noſtrils, in all the ceta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
tribe, have been already deſcribed: in this whale they are two; one on each
ſide the head before the eyes, and crooked, ſomewhat like the holes on the
belly of a violin. From theſe holes this animal blows the water very
fiercely, and with ſuch a noiſe that it roars like a hollow wind, and may
be heard at three miles diſtance. When wounded, it then blows more fiercely
than ever, ſo that it ſounds like the roaring of the ſea in a great
ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>We have already obſerved, that the ſubſtance called
whalebone, is taken from the upper jaw of the animal, and is very different
from the real bones of the whale. The real bones are hard, like thoſe of
great land animals, are very porous, and filled with marrow. Two great ſtrong
bones ſuſtain the under lip, lying againſt <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0823900106:204"/> each
other in the ſhape of an half-moon: ſome of theſe are twenty feet long;
they are ſeen in ſeveral gardens ſet up againſt each other, and are
uſually miſtaken for the ribs of this animal.</p>
                  <p>Such is the general conformation and figure of this great
inhabitant of the deep, the preciſe anatomy of which has not been yet
aſcertained. In thoſe places where they are caught in greateſt abundance,
the ſailors are not very curious as to the ſtructure of the viſcera; and
few anatomiſts care to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a taſk, where the operator, inſtead of
ſeparating with a lancet, muſt cut his way with an ax. It is as yet
doubted, therefore, whether the whale, that in moſt points inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
reſembles a quadrupede, may not have one great bowel fitted entirely for the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of air, to ſupply it, when conſtrained to keep longer than
uſual at the bottom. The ſailors univerſally affirm that it has; and
phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have nothing but the analogy of its parts to oppoſe to their
general aſſertions.</p>
                  <p>As theſe animals reſemble quadrupedes in conformation,
ſo they bear a ſtrong reſemblance in ſome of their appetites and
manners. The female joins with the male, as is aſſerted, <hi>more
humano,</hi> and once in two years feels the acceſſes of deſire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0823900106:205"/>Their fidelity to each other exceeds
whatever we are told of even the conſtancy of birds. Some fiſhers, as
Anderſon informs us, having ſtruck one of two whales, a male and a female,
that were in company together, the wounded fiſh made a long and terrible
reſiſtance: it ſtruck down a boat with three men in it, with a ſingle
blow of the tail, by which all went to the bottom. The other ſtill attended
its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and lent it every aſſiſtance; till, at laſt, the fiſh
that was ſtruck, ſunk under the number of its wounds; while its faithful
aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, diſdaining to ſurvive the loſs, with great bellowing,
ſtretched itſelf upon the dead fiſh, and ſhared his fate.</p>
                  <p>The whale goes with young nine or ten months, and is then
fatter than uſual, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when near the time of bringing forth. It is
ſaid that the embryo, when firſt percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, is about ſeventeen inches
long, and white; but the cub, when excluded, is black, and about ten feet long.
She generally produces one young one, and never above two. When ſhe ſuckles
her young, ſhe throws herſelf on one ſide on the ſurface of the ſea,
and the young one attaches itſelf to the tate. The breaſts are two;
generally hid within the belly; but ſhe <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0823900106:206"/> can produce
them at pleaſure, ſo as to ſtand forward a foot and an half, or two feet;
and the tates are like thoſe of a cow. In ſome, the breaſts are white; in
others, ſpeckled; in all, filled with a large quantity of milk, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
that of land animals.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can exceed the tenderneſs of the female for her
offspring; ſhe carries it with her wherever ſhe goes, and, when hardeſt
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, keeps it ſupported between her fins. Even when wounded, ſhe
ſtill claſps her young one; and when ſhe plunges to avoid danger, takes
it to the bottom; but riſes ſooner than uſual, to give it breath
again.</p>
                  <p>The young ones continue at the breaſt for a year; during
which time, they are called by the ſailors, <hi>ſhort-heads.</hi> They are
then extremely fat, and yield above fifty barrels of blubber. The mother, at
the ſame time, is equally lean and emaciated. At the age of two years they
are called <hi>ſtunts,</hi> as they do not thrive much immediately after
quitting the breaſt: they then yield ſcarce above twenty, or twenty-four,
barrels of blubber: from that time forward they are called
<hi>ſkull-fiſh,</hi> and their age is wholly unknown.</p>
                  <p>Every ſpecies of whale propagates only with thoſe of its
own kind, and does not at all min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0823900106:207"/> with the reſt:
however, they are generally ſeen in ſhoals, of different kinds together,
and make their migrations in large companies, from one ocean to another. They
are a gregarious animal, which implies their want of mutual defence againſt
the invaſions of ſmaller, but more powerful, fiſhes. It ſeems
aſtoniſhing, therefore, how a ſhoal of theſe enormous animals find
ſubſiſtence together, when it would ſeem that the ſupplying even one
with food would require greater plenty than the ocean could furniſh. To
encreaſe our wonder, we not only ſee them herding together, but uſually
find them fatter than any other animals of whatſoever ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We likewiſe
know that they cannot ſwallow large fiſhes, as their throat is ſo
nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that an animal larger than an herring could not enter. How then do
they ſubſiſt and grow ſo fat? A ſmall inſect which is ſeen
floating in thoſe ſeas, and which Linnaeus terms the Meduſa, is
ſufficient for this ſupply. Theſe inſects are black, and of the ſize
of a ſmall bean, and are ſometimes ſeen floating in cluſters on the
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water. They are of a round form, like ſnails in a box, but
they have wings, which are ſo tender that it is ſcarce poſſible to
touch them without breaking. Theſe ſerve rather for ſwimming than flying;
and the little <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0823900106:208"/> animal is called by the Icelanders, the
Walfiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choas, which ſignifies the whale's provender. They have the taſte
of raw muſcles, and have the ſmell of burnt ſugar. Theſe are the food
of the whale, which it is ſeen to draw up in great numbers with its huge
jaws, and to bruiſe between its barbs, which are always found with ſeveral
of theſe ſticking among them.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſimple food of the great Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land whale; it
purſues no other animal, leads an inoffenſive life in its element, and is
harmleſs in proportion to its ſtrength to do miſchief. There ſeems to
be an analogy between its manners and thoſe of the elephant. They are both
the ſtrongeſt and the largeſt animals in their reſpective ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
neither offer injury, but are terrible when provoked to reſentment. The
fin-fiſh indeed, in ſome meaſure, differs from the great whale in this
particular, as it ſubſiſts chiefly upon herrings, great ſhoals of which
it is often ſeen driving before it. Yet even the ſwallow of this fiſh is
not very large, if compared to the cachalot tribe; and its ravages are but
ſports in compariſon. The ſtomach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines of all theſe
animals, when opened, ſeldom have any thing in them, except a ſoft unctuous
ſubſtance, of a browniſh colour; and their excrements are of a ſhining
red.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0823900106:209"/>As the whale is an inoffenſive animal,
it is not to be wondered that it has many enemies, willing to take advantage of
its diſpoſition, and inaptitude for combat. There is a ſmall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, of
the ſhell-fiſh kind, called the Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe, that ſticks to its body,
as we ſee ſhells ſticking to the foul bottom of a ſhip. This
inſinuates itſelf chiefly under the fins; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever efforts the great
animal makes, it ſtill keeps its hold, and lives upon the fat, which it is
provided with inſtruments to arrive at.</p>
                  <p>The ſword-fiſh, however, is the whale's moſt terrible
enemy. 
<q rend="inline">"At the ſight of this little animal," ſays
Anderſon, "the whale ſeems agitated in an extraordinary manner; leaping
from the water as if with affright: wherever it appears, the whale perceives it
at a diſtance, and flies from it in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite direction. I have been
myſelf," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues he, "a ſpectator of their terrible encounter. The whale
has no inſtrument of defence except the tail; with that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to
ſtrike the enemy; and a ſingle blow taking place, would effectually
deſtroy its adverſary: but the ſword-fiſh is as active as the other is
ſtrong, and eaſily avoids the ſtroke; then bounding into the air, it
falls upon its great ſubjacent enemy, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0823900106:210"/>
not to pierce with its pointed beak, but to cut with its toothed edges. The
ſea all about is ſeen dyed with blood, proceeding from the wounds of the
whale; while the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous animal vainly endeavours to reach its invader, and
ſtrikes with its tail againſt the ſurface of the water, making a report
at each blow louder than the noiſe of a cannon."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is ſtill another and more powerful enemy called, by
the fiſhermen of New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Killer. This is itſelf a cetaceous
animal, armed with ſtrong and powerful teeth. A number of theſe are ſaid
to ſurround a whale, in the ſame manner as dogs get round a bull. Some
attack it with their teeth behind; others attempt it before; until, at laſt,
the great animal is torn down, and its tongue is ſaid to be the only part
they devour when they have made it their prey. They are ſaid to be of ſuch
great ſtrength, that one of them alone was known to ſtop a dead whale that
ſeveral boats were towing along, and drag it from among them to the
bottom.</p>
                  <p>But of all the enemies of theſe enormous fiſhes, man is
the greateſt: he alone deſtroys more in a year than the reſt in an age,
and actually has thinned their numbers in that part of the world where they are
chiefly ſought. The great reſort of theſe animals, was found to be 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0823900106:211"/> on the inhoſpitable ſhores of Spitzbergen; where the
diſtance of the voyage, the coldneſs of the climate, the terrors of the icy
ſea, and, ſtill more, their own formidable bulk, might have been expected
to protect them from human injury. But all theſe were but ſlight barriers
againſt man's arts, his courage, and his neceſſities. The European
ſhips, ſoon after the improvement of navigation, found the way into thoſe
ſeas; and as early as the beginning of the fourteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, the
Biſcayneers were in poſſeſſion of a very conſiderable trade to the
coaſts of Greenland. The Dutch and the Engliſh followed them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and
ſoon took that branch of commerce out of their hands. The Engliſh commenced
the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs about the beginning of the ſeventeenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury; and the
town of Hull had the honour of firſt attempting that profitable branch of
trade. But, at preſent, it ſeems upon the decline, as the quantity of
fiſh are ſo greatly reduced, by the conſtant capture for ſuch a vaſt
length of time. It is now ſaid, that the fiſhers, from a defect of whales,
apply themſelves to the ſeal-fiſhery; yet, as theſe animals are
extremely timorous, they will ſoon be induced to quit thoſe ſhores, where
they meet ſuch frequent diſturbance and danger. The poor natives of
Greenland themſelves, who uſed to feed upon <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0823900106:212"/> the
whale, are diminiſhing, in proportion as their ſuſtenance is removed;
and, it is probable; that the revolution of a few years will ſee that
extenſive coaſt totally deſerted by its inhabitants; as it is already
nearly deſerted by the whales.</p>
                  <p>The art of taking whales, like moſt others, is much improved
by time, and differs in many reſpects from that practiſed by the
Biſcayneers; when they firſt frequented the icy ſea. But as the
deſcription of their methods is the leaſt complicated, and conſequently
the eaſieſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, it will be beſt ſuited to our purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>For this navigation, the Biſcayneers, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
ſeaſons, fitted out thirty ſhips, of two hundred and fifty tons each,
with fifty choice men a-piece, and a few boys. Theſe were ſtored with ſix
month's proviſion; and each ſhip had its boats, which were to be
ſerviceable when come to the place of duty. When arrived at the part where
the whales are expected to paſs to the ſouthward, they always keep their
fails ſet, and a ſailor is placed at the maſt head, to give information
when he ſpies a whale. As ſoon as he diſcovers one, the whole crew are
inſtantly in employment: they fit out their boats, and row away to where the
whale was ſeen. The harpooner, who is to ſtrike the fiſh, ſtands at the
prow of the boat, with an harpoon <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0823900106:213"/> or javelin in his
hand, five or ſix feet long, pointed with ſteel like the barb of an arrow,
of a triangular ſhape. As this perſon's place is that of the greateſt
dexterity, ſo alſo it is of the greateſt danger: the whale ſometimes
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the boat with a blow of its tail, and ſometimes drives againſt
it with fury. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, however, the animal ſeems to ſleep on the
ſurface of the water; while the boat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, the harpooner ſtands
aloft, and, with his harpoon tied to a cord of ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fathom
length, darts it into the animal, and then rows as faſt as poſſible away.
It is for ſome time before the whale ſeems to feel the blow; the
inſtrument has uſually pierced no deeper than the fat, and that being
inſenſible, the animal continues for a while motionleſs; but ſoon
rouzed from its ſeeming lethargy, as the ſhaft continues to pierce deeper
and deeper into the muſcular fleſh, it flies off with amazing rapidity. In
the mean time, the harpoon ſticks in its ſide; while the rope, which is
coiled up in the boat, and runs upon a ſwivel, lengthens as the whale
recedes, but ſtill ſhews the part of the deep to which it has retreated.
The cord is coiled up with great care; for ſuch is the rapidity with which it
runs off, that if it was but the leaſt checked, as it yields with the
animal's retreat, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0823900106:214"/> it would infallibly overſet the
boat, and the crew would go to the bottom. It ſometimes happens alſo, that
the rapidity with which it runs over the ſwivel at the edge of the boat,
heats it, and it would infallibly take fire, did not a man ſtand continually
with a wet mop in his hand, to cool the ſwivel as the cord runs. The whale
having dived to a conſiderable depth, remains at the bottom, ſometimes for
near half an hour, with the harpoon in its body, and then riſes to take
breath, expecting the danger over: but the inſtant it appears, they are all
with their boats ready to receive it, and fling their harpoons into its body:
the animal again dives and again riſes, while they repeat their blows. The
ſhip follows in full ſail, like all the reſt, never loſing ſight of
the boats; and ready to lend them aſſiſtance; the whole ocean ſeems
dyed in blood. Thus they renew their attacks, till the whale begins to be quite
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled and ſpent, when they plunge their longer ſpears into various
parts of its body, and the enormous animal expires. When it is dead, to prevent
it from ſinking, they tie it with a ſtrong iron chain to the ſide of the
boat, and either cut it up in pieces, and carry it home in that manner, or
extract the oil from the blubber on ſhip-board.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0823900106:215"/>Such is the manner in which theſe
fiſh were taken in the beginning; but ſucceeding arts have improved the
method, and the harpoon is now thrown by; a machine being uſed which inflicts
a deeper wound, and ſtrikes the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal with much greater certainty: there
are better methods for extracting the oil, and properer machines for cutting
the animal up, than were uſed in the early fiſheries. But as an account of
this belongs to the hiſtory of art, and not of nature, we muſt be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, with obſerving, that ſeveral parts of this animal, and all but
the inteſtines and the bones, are turned to very good account; not only the
oil, but the greaves from which it is ſeparated. The barbs alſo were an
article of great profit; but have ſunk in their price ſince women no longer
uſe them to ſwell out their petticoats with whale-bone. The fleſh of this
animal is alſo a dainty to ſome nations; and even the French ſea-men are
now and then found to dreſs and uſe it as their ordinary diet at ſea. It
is ſaid, by the Engliſh and Dutch ſailors, to be hard and ill-taſted;
but the French aſſert the contrary; and the ſavages of Greenland, as well
as thoſe near the ſouth pole, are fond of it to diſtraction. They eat the
fleſh, and drink the oil, which is a firſt rate delicacy. The find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0823900106:216"/> a dead whale is an adventure conſidered among the
fortunate circumſtances of their wretched lives. They make their abode
beſide it; and ſeldom remove till they have left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the
bones.</p>
                  <p>Jacobſon, whom we quoted before in the Hiſtory of Birds,
where he deſcribes his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen of the iſland of Feroe as living a part
of the year upon ſalted gulls, tells us alſo, that they are very fond of
ſalted whale's fleſh. The fat of the head they ſeaſon with bay ſalt,
and then hang it up to dry in the chimney. He thinks it taſtes as well as fat
bacon; and the lean, which they boil, is, in his opinion, not inferior to beef.
I fancy poor Jacobſon would make but an indifferent taſter at one of our
city feaſts!</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Narwhal.</head>
                  <p>FROM whales that entirely want teeth, we come to ſuch as
have them in the upper jaw only; and in this claſs there is found but one,
the Narwhal, or Sea-unicorn. This fiſh is not ſo large as the whale, not
being above ſixty feet long. Its body is ſlenderer than that of the whale,
and its fat not in ſo great abundance. But this great animal is
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſtinguiſhed from all others of the deep by its tooth or
teeth, which ſtand pointing directly forward from the upper jaw, and are from
nine to fourteen feet long. In all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of weapons with which Nature
has armed her various tribes, there is not one ſo large or ſo formidable as
this. This terrible weapon is generally found ſingle; and ſome are of
opinion that the animal is furniſhed but with one by nature; but there is at
preſent the ſkull of a narwhal at the Stadthouſe at Amſterdam with two
teeth; which plainly proves that in ſome animals, at leaſt, this
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is double. It is even a doubt whether it may not be ſo in all;
and that the narwhal's <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0823900106:218"/> wanting a tooth is only an
accident which it has met with in the encounters it is obliged daily to be
engaged in. Yet it muſt be owned of theſe that are taken only with one
tooth, there ſeems no ſocket nor no remains of any other upon the
oppoſite ſide of the jaw, but all is plain and even. However this be, the
tooth, or, as ſome are pleaſed to call it, the horn of the narwhal is the
moſt terrible of all natural inſtruments of deſtruction. It is as
ſtraight as an arrow, about the thickneſs of the ſmall of a man's leg,
wreathed in the manner we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee twiſted bars of iron; it tapers
to a ſharp point; and is whiter, heavier, and harder than ivory. It is
generally ſeen to ſpring from the left ſide of the head directly forward
in a ſtraight line with the body; and its root enters into the ſocket above
a foot and an half. In a ſkull to be ſeen at Hamburgh there are two teeth,
which are each above ſeven feet long, and are eight inches in circumference.
When the animal poſſeſſed of theſe formidable weapons is urged to
employ them, it drives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly forward againſt the enemy with its teeth,
that, like portended ſpears, pierce whatever ſtands before them.</p>
                  <p>The extreme length of theſe inſtruments have induced
ſome to conſider them rather as <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0823900106:219"/> horns than teeth;
but they in every reſpect reſemble the tuſks of the boar and the
elephant. They grow, as in them, from ſockets in the upper jaw; they have the
ſolidity of the hardeſt bone, and far ſurpaſs ivory in all its
qualities. The ſame error has led others to ſuppoſe, that as among
quadrupedes the female was often found without horns, ſo theſe
inſtruments of defence were only to be found in the male; but this has been
more than once refuted by actual experience; both ſexes are found armed in
this manner; the horn is ſometimes found wreathed and ſometimes ſmooth;
ſometimes a little bent and ſometimes ſtraight; but always ſtrong,
deeply fixed, and ſharply pointed.</p>
                  <p>Yet, notwithſtanding all theſe appointments for combat,
theſe long and pointed tuſks, amazing ſtrength, and unmatchable celerity,
the narwhal is one of the moſt harmleſs and peaceful inhabitants of the
ocean. It is ſeen conſtantly and inoffenſively ſporting among the other
great monſters of the deep, no way at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to injure them, but pleaſed
in their company The Greenlanders call the narwhal the fore-runner of the
whale; for wherever it is ſeen, the whale is ſhortly after ſure to
follow. This may ariſe as well from the natural paſſion for ſociety in
theſe animals as from both living <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0823900106:220"/> upon the ſame
food, which are the inſects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the preceding chapter. Theſe
powerful fiſhes make war upon no other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and, though
furniſhed with inſtruments to ſpread general deſtruction, are as
innocent and as peaceful as a drove of oxen. Nay, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs are they
of their own weapons, and ſo utterly unmindful to keep them in repair for
engagement, that they are conſtantly ſeen co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with weeds,
ſlough, and all the filth of the ſea; they ſeem rather conſidered as an
impediment than a defence.</p>
                  <p>The manners and appetites both of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whal and the great
whale are entirely ſimilar; they both alike want teeth for chewing, and are
obliged to live upon inſects; they both are peaceable and harmleſs, and
always rather fly than ſeek the combat. The narwhal, however, has a much
narrower gape than the great whale, and therefore does not want the uſe of
barbs to keep in its food when once ſucked into the mouth. It is alſo much
ſwifter, and would never be taken by the fiſherman but for thoſe very
tuſks, which at firſt appear to be its principal defence. Theſe animals,
as was ſaid, being fond of living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, are always ſeen in herds of
ſeveral at a time; and whenever they are attacked, they crowd together in
ſuch a manner, that they are <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0823900106:221"/> mutually embaraſſed
by their tuſks. By theſe they are often locked together, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
from ſinking to the bottom. It ſeldom happens, therefore, but the
fiſhermen make ſure of one or two of the hindmoſt, which very well reward
their trouble.</p>
                  <p>It is from the extraordinary circumſtance of the teeth,
therefore, that this fiſh demands a diſtinct hiſtory; and ſuch has been
the curioſity of mankind, and their deſire to procure them, that a century
ago they were conſidered as the greateſt rarity in the world. At that time
the art of catching whales was not known; and mankind ſaw few, except ſuch
as were ſtranded on the coaſts by accident. The tooth of the narwhal,
therefore, was aſcribed to a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent animal from that which really
bore it. Among other foſſil ſubſtances they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dug up;
and the narwhal being utterly unknown, naturaliſts ſoon found a
terreſtrial owner. They were thought to be the horns of unicorns, an animal
deſcribed by Pliny as reſembling an horſe, and with one ſtraight horn
darting forward from the middle of its forehead. Theſe teeth were, therefore,
conſidered as a ſtrong teſtimony in favour of that hiſtorian's
veracity, and were ſhewn among the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious remains of antiquity.
Even for ſome <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0823900106:222"/> time after the narwhal was known, the
deceit was continued, as thoſe who were poſſeſſed of a tooth ſold
it to great advantage. But at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they are too well known to deceive
any, and are only ſhewn for what they really are; their curioſity
encreaſing in proportion to their weight and their ſize.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of the Cachalot and its Varieties.</head>
                  <p>THE Cachalot, which has generally gone under the name of the
Spermaceti Whale, till Mr. Penant very properly made the diſtinction, by
borrowing its name from the French, has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral teeth in the under-jaw, but
none in the upper. As there are no leſs than ſeven di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions among
whales, ſo alſo there are the ſame number of diſtinctions in the tribe
we are deſcribing. The cachalot with two fins and a black back; the cachalot
with two fins and a whitiſh back; that with a ſpout in the neck; that with
the ſpout in the ſnout; that with three fins and ſharp pointed teeth;
that with three fins and ſharp edged teeth; and laſtly, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalot with
three fins and flatted teeth.</p>
                  <p>This tribe is not of ſuch enormous ſize as the whale,
properly ſo called, not being above ſixty feet long and ſixteen feet
high. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their being more ſlender, they are much more
active than the common whale; they remain a longer time at the bottom; and
afford a ſmaller quantity of oil. As in the common whale the head was ſeen
to make a third part of its bulk, ſo in this ſpecies the 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0823900106:224"/> head is ſo large as to make one half of the whole. The
tongue of this animal is ſmall; but the throat is very formidable; and with
very great eaſe it could ſwallow an ox. In the ſtomach of the whale
ſcarce any thing is to be found; but in that of the cachalot there are loads
of fiſh of different kinds; ſome whole, ſome half digeſted, ſome
ſmall, and others eight or nine feet long. The cachalot is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as
deſtructive among leſſer fiſhes as the whale is harmleſs; and can at
one gulp ſwallow a ſhoal of fiſhes down its enormous gullet. Linnaeus
tells us that this fiſh purſues and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the dolphins and porpoiſes
ſo much, as often to drive them on ſhore.</p>
                  <p>But, how formidable ſoever this fiſh may be to its fellows
of the deep, it is by far the moſt valuable, and the moſt ſought after by
man, as it contains two very precious drugs, ſpermaceti and amber-greaſe.
The uſe of theſe, either for the purpoſes of luxury or medicine, is ſo
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, that the capture of this animal, that alone ſupplies them,
turns out to very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, particularly ſince the art has been found
out of converting all the oil of this animal, as well as the brain, into that
ſubſtance called ſpermaceti.</p>
                  <p>This ſubſtance, as it is naturally formed, is 
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0823900106:225"/> found in the head of the animal, and is no other than
the brain. The outward ſkin of the head being taken off, a covering of fat
offers about three inches thick; and under that, inſtead of a bony ſkull,
the animal has only another thick ſkin, that ſerves for a covering and
defence of the brain. The firſt cavity, or chamber, of the brain, is filled
with that ſpermaceti which is ſuppoſed of the greateſt purity and
higheſt value. From this cavity there is generally drawn about ſeven
barrels of the cleareſt ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maceti, that thrown upon water coagulates like
cheeſe. Below this there is another chamber juſt over the gullet, which is
about ſeven feet high; and this alſo contains the drug, but of leſs
value. It is diſtributed in this cavity like honey in a hive, in ſmall
cells, ſeparated from each other by a membrane like the inner ſkin of an
egg. In proportion as the oily ſubſtance is drawn away from this part it
fills anew from every part of the body; and from this is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obtained
about nine barrels of oil. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, the ſpinal marrow, which is about
as thick as a man's thigh, and reaches all along the back-bone to the tail,
where it is not thicker than one's finger, affords no inconſiderable
quantity.</p>
                  <p>This ſubſtance, which is uſed in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0823900106:226"/> of many medicines, rather to give them conſiſtence
than efficacy, was at firſt ſold at a very high price, both from the many
virtues aſcribed to it and the ſmall quantity that the cachalot was capable
of ſupplying; at preſent, the price is greatly fallen; firſt, becauſe
its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy in medicine is found to be very ſmall; and again becauſe the
whole oil of the fiſh is very eaſily convertible into ſpermaceti. This is
performed by boiling it with a lea of pot-aſh, and hardening it in the manner
of ſoap. Candles are now made of it, which are ſubſtituted for wax, and
ſold much cheaper; ſo that we need not fear having our ſpermaceti
adulterated in the manner ſome medical books caution us to beware of; for
they carefully guard us againſt having our ſpermaceti adulterated with
virgin's wax.</p>
                  <p>As to the amber greaſe which is ſometimes found in this
whale, it was long conſidered as a ſubſtance found floating on the
ſurface of the ſea; but time, that reveals the ſecrets of the mercenary,
has diſcovered that it chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this animal. The name, which has
been improperly given to the former ſubſtance, ſeems more juſtly to
belong to this; for the amber greaſe is found in the place where the
ſeminal veſſels are uſually ſituated in other <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0823900106:227"/>
animals. It is found in a bag of three or four feet long, in round lumps, from
one to twenty pounds weight, floating in a fluid rather thinner than oil, and
of a yellowiſh colour. There are never ſeen more than four at a time in one
of theſe bags; and that which weighed twenty pounds, and which was the
largeſt ever ſeen, was found ſingle. Theſe balls of amber greaſe are
not found in all fiſhes of this kind, but chiefly in the oldeſt and
ſtrongeſt. The uſes of this medicine for the purpoſes of luxury and as
a perfume are well known; though upon ſome ſubjects ignorance is preferable
to information.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Dolphin, the Grampus, and the Porpus, with
their Varieties.</head>
                  <p>ALL theſe fiſh have teeth both in the upper and the lower
jaw, and are much leſs than the whale. The Grampus, which is the largeſt,
never exceeds twenty feet. It may alſo be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the
flatneſs of its head, which reſembles a boat turned upſide down. The
porpus reſembles the grampus in moſt things except the ſnout, which is
not above eight feet long; its ſnout alſo more reſembles that of an hog.
The dolphin has a ſtrong reſemblance to the porpus, except that its ſnout
is longer and more pointed. They have all fins on the back; they all have heads
very large, like the reſt of of the whale-kind; and reſemble each other in
their appetites, their mannners, and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; being equally voracious,
active, and roving.</p>
                  <p>The great agility of theſe animals prevents their often
being taken. They ſeldom remain a moment above water; ſometimes, indeed,
their too eager purſuits expoſe them to danger; and a ſhoal of herrings
often allures them out of <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0823900106:229"/> their depth. In ſuch a
caſe, the hungry animal continues to flounder in the ſhallows till knocked
on the head, or till the retiring tide ſeaſonably comes to its relief. But
all this tribe, and the dolphin in particular, are not leſs ſwift than
deſtructive. No fiſh could eſcape them, but from the aukward poſition
of the mouth, which is placed in a manner under the head: yet, even with
theſe diſadvantages, their depredations are ſo great, that they have been
juſtly ſtiled the plunderers of the deep.</p>
                  <p>What could induce the ancients to a predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in favour of
theſe animals, particularly the dolphin, it is not eaſy to account for.
Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians and philoſophers ſeem to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended who ſhould invent
the greateſt number of fables concerning them. The dolphin was celebrated in
the earlieſt time for its fondneſs to the human race, and was
diſtinguiſhed by the epithets of the boy-loving and philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropiſt.
Scarce an accident could happen at ſea but the dolphin offered himſelf to
convey the unfortunate to ſhore. The muſician flung into the ſea by
pirates, the boy taking an airing into the midſt of the ſea, and returning
again in ſafety, were obliged to the dolphin for its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. It is not
eaſy, I ſay, to aſſign a cauſe why the ancients ſhould thus have
invented ſo <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0823900106:230"/> many fables in their favour. The figure of
theſe animals is far from prejudicing us in their intereſts; their extreme
rapacity tends ſtill leſs to endear them: I know nothing that can
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to man and excite his prejudices, except that when taken they
ſometimes have a plaintiff moan, with which they continue to expreſs their
pain till they expire. This, at firſt, might have excited human pity; and
that might have produced affection. At preſent, theſe fiſhes are regarded
even by the vulgar in a very different light; their appearance is far from
being eſteemed a favourable omen by the ſea-men; and from their boundings,
ſprings, and frolics in the water, experience has taught the mariners to
prepare for a ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>But it is not to one circumſtance only that the ancients
have confined their fabulous reports concerning theſe animals; as from their
leaps out of their element, they aſſume a temporary curvature, which is by
no means their natural figure in the water, the old painters and ſculptors
have univerſally drawn them wrong. A dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin is ſcarce ever exhibited by
the ancients in a ſtraight ſhape, but curved, in the poſition which they
ſometimes appear in when exerting their force; and the poets too have adopted
the general error. Even Pliny, the beſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt, <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0823900106:231"/>
has aſſerted, that they inſtantly die when taken out of the water; but
Rondelet, on the contrary, aſſures us, that he has ſeen a dolphin carried
alive from Montpellier to Lyons.</p>
                  <p>The moderns have more juſt notions of theſe animals; and
have got over the many fables, which every day's experience contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts.
Indeed their numbers are ſo great, and, though ſhy, they are ſo often
taken, that ſuch peculiarities, if they were poſſeſſed of any, would
have been long ſince aſcertained. They are found, the porpeſs
eſpecially, in ſuch vaſt numbers, in all parts of the ſea that
ſurrounds this kingdom, that they are ſometimes noxious to ſeamen, when
they ſail in ſmall veſſels. In ſome places they almoſt darken the
water as they riſe to take breath, and particularly before bad weather are
much agitated, ſwimming againſt the wind, and tumbling about with
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual violence.</p>
                  <p>Whether theſe motions be the gambols of pleaſure, or the
agitations of terror, is not well known. It is moſt probable that they dread
thoſe ſeaſons of turbulence, when the leſſer fiſhes ſhrink to the
bottom, and their prey no longer offers in ſufficient abundance. In times of
fairer weather, they are ſeen herding together, and purſuing ſhoals of
various fiſh <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0823900106:232"/> with great impetuoſity. Their method of
hunting their game, if it may be ſo called, is to follow in a pack, and thus
give each other mutual aſſiſtance. At that ſeaſon when the mackarel,
the herring, the ſalmon, and other fiſh of paſſage, begin to make their
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the cetaceous tribes are ſeen fierce in the purſuit; urging
their prey from one creek or bay to another, deterring them from the
ſhallows, driving them towards each other's ambuſh, and uſing a greater
variety of arts than hounds are ſeen to exert in purſuing the hare.
However, the porpeſs not only ſeeks for prey near the ſurface, but often
deſcends to the bottom in ſearch of ſand-eels and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, which it
roots out of the ſand with its noſe, in the manner hogs harrow up the
fields for food. For this purpoſe, the noſe projects a little, is ſhorter
and ſtronger than that of the dolphin; and the neck is furniſhed with very
ſtrong muſcles, which enable it the readier to turn up the ſand.</p>
                  <p>But it ſometimes happens, that the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity, or the
hunger, of theſe animals, in their uſual purſuits, urges them beyond the
limits of ſafety. The fiſhermen, who extend their long nets for pilchards,
on the coaſts of Cornwall, have ſometimes an unwelcome cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0823900106:233"/> in one of theſe. Their feeble nets, which are
calculated only for taking ſmaller prey, ſuffer an univerſal laceration,
from the efforts of this ſtrong animal to eſcape; and if it be not knocked
on the head, before it has had time to flounder, the nets are deſtroyed, and
the fiſhery interrupted. There is nothing, therefore, they ſo much dread,
as the entangling a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſs; and they do every thing to intimidate the
animal from approaching.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, theſe creatures are ſo violent in the purſuit of
their prey, that they ſometimes follow a ſhoal of ſmall fiſhes up a
freſh-water river, from whence they find no ſmall difficulty to return. We
have often ſeen them taken in the Thames at London, both above the bridges
and below them. It is curious enough to obſerve with what activity they avoid
their purſuers, and what little time they require to fetch breath above the
water. The manner of killing them is for four or five boats to ſpread over
the part of the river in which they are ſeen, and with fire-arms to ſhoot
at them the inſtant they riſe above the water. The fiſh being thus for
ſome time kept in agitation, requires to come to the ſurface at quicker
intervals, and thus affords the markſmen more frequent opportunities.</p>
                  <p>When the porpeſs is taken, it becomes no 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0823900106:234"/> inconſiderable capture, as it yields a very large
quantity of oil; and the lean of ſome, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly if the animal be young,
is ſaid to be as well taſted as veal. The inhabitants of Norway prepare
from the eggs found in the body of this fiſh, a kind of caviar, which is
ſaid to be very delicate ſauce, or good when even eaten with bread. There
is a fiſhery for porpeſs along the weſtern iſles of Scotland during the
ſummer ſeaſon, when they abound on that ſhore; and this branch of
induſtry turns to good advantage.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt, we are told, that theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals go with
young ten months; that, like the whale, they ſeldom bring forth above one at
a time, and that in the midſt of ſummer: that they live to a conſiderable
age; though ſome ſay not above twenty five or thirty years; and they
ſleep with the ſnout above water. They ſeem to poſſeſs, in a degree
proportioned to their bulk, the manners of whales; and the hiſtory of one
ſpecies of cetaceous animals will, in a great meaſure, ſerve for all the
reſt.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of Cartilaginous Fiſhes in General.</head>
                  <p>WE have ſeen that fiſhes of the cetaceous kind bear a
ſtrong reſemblance to quadrupedes in their conformation; thoſe of the
cartilaginous kinds are one remove ſeparated from them: they form the ſhade
that completes the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible gradations of nature.</p>
                  <p>The firſt great diſtinction they exhibit is, in having
cartilages or griſtles inſtead of bones. The cetaceous tribes have their
bones entirely reſembling thoſe of quadrupedes, thick, white, and filled
with marrow: thoſe of the ſpinous kind, on the contrary, have ſmall
ſlender bones, with points reſembling thorns, and generally ſolid
throughout. Fiſhes of the cartilaginous kinds have their bones always ſoft
and yielding; and age, that hardens the bones of other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, rather
contributes ſtill more to ſoften theirs. The ſize of all fiſhes
encreaſes with age; but from the pliancy of the bones in this tribe, they
ſeem to have no bounds placed to their dimenſions: and it is ſuppoſed
that they grow larger every day till they die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0823900106:237"/>They have other differences, more
obviouſly diſcernible. We have obſerved, that the ceta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous tribes had
lungs like quadrupedes, an heart with its partition in the ſame manner, and
an apparatus for hearing; on the other hand we mentioned, that the ſpinous
kinds had no organs of hearing, no lungs to breathe through, and no partition
in the heart; but that their cold red blood was circulated by the means of the
impulſe made upon their gills by the water. Cartilaginous fiſhes unite both
theſe ſyſtems in their conformation: like the cetaceous tribes, they have
organs of hearing, and lungs; like the ſpinous kinds, they have gills, and an
heart without a partition. Thus poſſeſſed of a two-fold power of
breathing, ſometimes by means of their lungs, ſometimes by that of their
gills, they ſeem to unite all the advantages of which their ſituation is
capable, and drawing from both elements, every aid to their neceſſities or
their enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>This double capacity of breathing in theſe animals, is one
of the moſt remarkable features in the hiſtory of nature. The apertures by
which they breathe, are ſomewhere placed about the head; either beneath, as
in flat fiſh; on the ſides, as in ſharks; or on the top of the head, as
in pipe-fiſh. To theſe apertures are the gills <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0823900106:238"/>
affixed, but without any bone to open and ſhut them, as in ſpinous
fiſhes; from which, by this mark, they may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed,
though otherwiſe very much alike in appearance. From theſe are bending
cylindrical ducts, that run to the lungs, and are ſuppoſed to convey the
air, that gives the organs their proper play. The heart, however, has but one
valve; ſo that their blood wants that double circulation which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in
the cetaceous kinds; and the lungs ſeem to me rather as an internal
aſſiſtant to the gills, than fitted for ſupplying the ſame offices as
in quadrupedes, for they want the pulmonary vein and artery.</p>
                  <p>From this ſtructure, however, the animal is enabled to live
a longer time out of water than thoſe whoſe gills are more ſimple. The
carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous ſhark, or ray, live ſome hours after they are taken; while
the ſpinous herring or mackarel expire a few minutes after they are brought
on ſhore. From hence this tribe ſeems poſſeſſed of powers that
other fiſhes are wholly deprived of; they can remain continually under water,
without ever taking breath; while they can venture their heads above the deep,
and continue for hours out of their native element.</p>
                  <p>We obſerved, in a former chapter, that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fiſhes
have not, or at leaſt appear not to <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0823900106:239"/> have, externally
any inſtruments of generation. It is very different with thoſe of the
carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous kind, for the male always has theſe inſtruments double. The
fiſh of this tribe are not unfrequently ſeen to copulate; and their manner
is belly to belly, ſuch as may naturally be expected from animals whoſe
parts of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration are placed forward. They in general chuſe colder
ſeaſons and ſituations than other fiſh for propagating their kind; and
many of them bring forth in the midſt of winter.</p>
                  <p>The ſame duplicity of character which marks their general
conformation obtains alſo with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their manner of bringing forth.
Some bring forth their young alive; and ſome bring forth eggs, which are
afterwards brought to maturity. In all, however, the manner of geſtation is
nearly the ſame; for upon diſſection, it is ever found, that the young,
while in the body, continue in the egg till a very little time before they are
excluded; theſe eggs they may properly be ſaid to hatch within their body;
and as ſoon as their young quit the ſhell, they begin to quit the womb
alſo. Unlike to quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes, or the cetaceous tribes, that quit the egg
ſtate a few days after their firſt conception, and continue in the womb
ſeveral months after, theſe continue in the body of the female, in their
egg <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0823900106:240"/> ſtate, for weeks together; and the eggs are found
linked together by a membrane, from which, when the faetus gets free, it
continues but a very ſhort time till it delivers itſelf from its
confinement in the womb. The eggs themſelves conſiſt of a white and a
yolk, and have a ſubſtance, inſtead of ſhell, that aptly may be
compared to ſoftened horn. Theſe, as I obſerved, are ſometimes hatched
in the womb, as in the ſhark and ray kinds; and they are ſometimes
excluded, as in the ſturgeon, before the animal comes to its time of
diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging. Thus we ſee that there ſeems very little difference between
the viviparous and the oviparous kinds, in this claſs of fiſhes; the one
hatch their eggs in the womb, and the young continue no long time there; the
others exclude their eggs before hatching, and leave it to time and accident to
bring their young to maturity.</p>
                  <p>Such are the peculiar marks of the carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous claſs of
fiſhes, of which there are many kinds. To give a diſtinct deſcription of
every fiſh is as little my intention, as perhaps it is the wiſh of the
reader; but the peculiarities of each kind deſerve notice, and the moſt
ſtriking of theſe it would be unpardonable to omit.</p>
                  <p>Cartilaginous fiſh may be divided firſt into 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0823900106:241"/> thoſe of the ſhark kind, with a body growing leſs
towards the tail, a rough ſkin, with the mouth placed far beneath the end of
the noſe, five apertures on the ſides of the neck for breathing, and the
upper part of the tail longer than the lower. This claſs chiefly comprehends
the Great White Shark, the Balance Fiſh, the Hound Fiſh, the Monk Fiſh,
the Dog Fiſh, the Baſking Shark, the Zygaena, the Tope, the Cat Fiſh, the
Blue Shark, the Sea Fox, the Smooth Hound Fiſh, and the Porbeagle. Theſe
are all of the ſame nature, and differ more in ſize, than in figure or
conformation.</p>
                  <p>The next diviſion is that of flat fiſh; and theſe their
broad, flat, thin ſhape is ſufficiently capable of diſtinguiſhing from
all others of this kind. They may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed alſo from
ſpinous flat fiſh, by the holes through which they breathe, which are
uncovered by a bone; and which, in this kind, are five on each ſide. In this
tribe we may place the Torpedo, the Skate, the Sharp-noſed Ray, the Rough
Ray, the Thornback, and the Fire Flare.</p>
                  <p>The third diviſion is that of the ſlender ſnake-ſhaped
kind: ſuch as the Lamprey, the Pride, and the Pipe Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>The fourth diviſion is of the Sturgeon and its variety, the
Iſing-glaſs Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0823900106:242"/>The laſt diviſion may comprize
fiſh of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent figures and natures, that do not rank under the former
diviſions. Theſe are the Sun Fiſh, the Tetrodon, the Lump Fiſh the Sea
Snail, the Chimaera and the Fiſhing Frog. Each of theſe has ſomewhat
peculiar in its powers or its form, that deſerves to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked. The
deſcription of the figures of theſe at leaſt may compenſate for our
general igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the reſt of their hiſtory.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of Cartilaginous Fiſhes of the Shark
Kind.</head>
                  <p>OF all the inhabitants of the deep, thoſe of the ſhark
kind are the fierceſt and the moſt voracious. The ſmalleſt of this
tribe is not leſs dreaded by greater fiſh, than many that to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
ſeem more powerful; nor do any of them ſeem fearful of attacking animals
far above their ſize: but the Great White Shark, which is the largeſt of
the kind, joins to the moſt amazing rapidity, the ſtrongeſt appetites for
miſchief: as he approaches nearly in ſize to the whale, he far
ſurpaſſes him in ſtrength and celerity, in the formidable arrangement
of his teeth, and his inſatiable deſire of plunder.</p>
                  <p>The white ſhark is ſometimes ſeen to rank even among
whales for magnitude; and is found from twenty to thirty feet long. Some
aſſert that they have ſeen them of four thouſand pound weight; and we
are told particularly of one, that had a human corpſe in his belly. The head
is large, and ſomewhat flatted; the ſnout long, and the eyes large. The
mouth is enormouſly wide; as is the throat, and capable of ſwallowing a man
with great eaſe. But its <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0823900106:244"/> furniture of teeth is ſtill
more terrible: of theſe there are ſix rows, extremely hard,
ſharp-pointed, and of a wedge-like figure. It is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that there are
ſeventy-two in each jaw, which make one hundred and forty-four in the whole;
yet others think that their number is uncertain; and that, in proportion as the
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal grows older, theſe terrible inſtruments of deſtruction are found
to encreaſe. With theſe the jaws both above and below appear planted all
over; but the animal has a power of erecting or depreſſing them at
pleaſure. When the ſhark is at reſt, they lie quite flat in his mouth;
but when he prepares to ſeize his prey, he erects all this dreadful
apparatus, by the help of a ſet of muſcles that join them to the jaw; and
the animal he ſeizes, dies pierced with an hundred wounds in a moment.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this fiſh leſs terrible to behold as to the reſt
of his form: his fins are larger, in proportion; he is furniſhed with great
goggle eyes, that he turns with eaſe on every ſide, ſo as to ſee his
prey behind him as well as before; and his whole aſpect is marked with a
character of malignity: his ſkin alſo is rough, hard and prickly; being
that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which covers inſtrument caſes, called ſhagreen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0823900106:245"/>As the ſhark is thus formidable in his
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſo is he alſo dreadful, from his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and activity. No
fiſh can ſwim ſo faſt as he; none ſo conſtantly employed in
ſwimming, he outſtrips the ſwifteſt ſhips, plays round them, darts
out before them, returns, ſeems to gaze at the paſſengers, and all the
while does not ſeem to exhibit the ſmalleſt ſymptom of an effort to
proceed. Such amazing powers, with ſuch great appetites for deſtruction,
would quickly unpeople even the ocean, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially the ſhark's upper
jaw projects ſo far above the lower, that he is obliged to turn on one ſide
(not on his back, as is generally ſuppoſed) to ſeize his prey. As this
takes ſome ſmall time to perform, the animal purſued ſeizes that
opportunity to make its eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Still, however, the depredations he commits are frequent and
formidable. The ſhark is the dread of ſailors in all hot climates; where,
like a greedy robber, he attends the ſhips, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of what may drop
over board. A man who unfortunately falls into the ſea at ſuch a time, is
ſure to periſh, without mercy. A ſailor that was bathing in the
Mediterranean, near Antibes, in the year 1744, while he was ſwimming about
fifty yards from the ſhip, <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0823900106:246"/> perceived a monſtrous
fiſh making towards him, and ſurveying him on every ſide, as fiſh are
often ſeen to look round a bait. The poor man, ſtruck with terror at its
approach, cried out to his companions in the veſſel to take him on board.
They accordingly threw him a rope with the utmoſt expedition, and were
drawing him up by the ſhip's ſide, when the ſhark darted after him from
the deep, and ſnapped off his leg.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Penant tells us, that the maſter of a Guinea-ſhip,
finding a rage for ſuicide prevail among his ſlaves, from a notion the
unhappy creatures had, that after death they ſhould be reſtored again to
their families, friends and country; to convince them at leaſt that ſome
diſgrace ſhould attend them here, he ordered one of their dead bodies to be
tied by the heels to a rope, and ſo let down into the ſea; and though it
was drawn up again with great ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet, in that ſhort ſpace, the
ſharks had bit off all but the feet. Whether this ſtory is prior to an
accident of the ſame kind, which happened at Belfaſt, in Ireland, about
twenty years ago, I will not take upon me to determine; but certain it is,
there are ſome circumſtances alike in both, though more terrible in that I
am going to relate. A Guinea captain was, <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0823900106:247"/> by ſtreſs
of weather, driven into the harbour of Belfaſt, with a lading of very
ſickly ſlaves, who, in the manner above-mentioned, took every opportunity
to throw themſelves over board when brought up upon deck, as is uſual, for
the benefit of the freſh air. The captain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, among others, a woman
ſlave attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drown herſelf, pitched upon her as a proper example to
the reſt: as he ſuppoſed that they did not know the terrors attending
death, he ordered the woman to be tied with a rope under the arm-pits, and ſo
let her down into the water. When the poor creature was thus plunged in, and
about half way down, ſhe was heard to give a terrible ſhriek, which at
firſt was aſcribed to her fears of drowning; but ſoon after the water
appearing red all round her, ſhe was drawn up, and it was found that a
ſhark, which had followed the ſhip, had bit her off from the middle.</p>
                  <p>Such is the frightful rapacity of this animal; nothing that
has life is rejected. But it ſeems to have a peculiar enmity to man: when
once it has taſted human fleſh, it never deſiſts from haunting thoſe
places where it expects the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of its prey. It is even aſſerted, that
along the coaſts of Africa, where theſe animals are found in great
abundance, numbers of the <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0823900106:248"/> Negroes, who are obliged to
frequent the waters, are ſeized and devoured by them every year. The people
of theſe coaſts are firmly of opinion, that the ſhark loves the black
man's fleſh in preference to the white; and that when men of different
colours are in the water together, it always makes choice of the former.</p>
                  <p>However this be, men of all colours are equally afraid of this
animal, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived different methods to deſtroy him. In general,
they derive their ſucceſs from the ſhark's own rapacity. The uſual
method of our ſailors to take him, is by baiting a great hook with a piece of
beef or pork, which is thrown out into the ſea by a ſtrong cord,
ſtrengthened near the hook with an iron chain. Without this precaution, the
ſhark would quickly bite the cord in two, and thus ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free. It
is no unpleaſant amuſement to obſerve this voracious animal coming up to
ſurvey the bait, particularly when not preſſed by hunger. He approaches
it, examines it, ſwims round it, ſeems for a while to neglect it, perhaps
apprehenſive of the cord and the chain: he quits it for a little; but his
appetite preſſing, he returns again; appears preparing to devour it, but
quits it once more. When the ſailors have ſufficiently diverted
themſelves with his <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0823900106:249"/> different evolutions, they then
make a pretence, by drawing the rope, as if intending to take the bait away; it
is then that the glutton's hunger excites him; he darts at the bait, and
ſwallows it, hook and all. Sometimes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he does not ſo entirely
gorge the whole, but that he once more gets free; yet even then, though wounded
and bleeding with the hook, he will again purſue the bait until he is taken.
When he finds the hook lodged in his maw, his utmoſt efforts are then
excited, but in vain, to get free; he tries with his teeth to cut the chain; he
pulls with all his force to break the line; he almoſt ſeems to turn his
ſtomach inſide out, to diſgorge the hook: in this manner he continues his
formidable though fruitleſs efforts; till quite ſpent, he ſuffers his
head to be drawn above water, and the ſailors, confining his tail by a nooze,
in this manner draw him on ſhip board, and diſpatch him. This is done by
beating him on the head till he dies; yet even that is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without
difficulty and danger; the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous creature, terrible even in the agonies of
death, ſtill ſtruggles with his deſtroyers; nor is there an animal in the
world that is harder to be killed. Even when cut in pieces, the muſcles
ſtill preſerve their motion, and vibrate for ſome minutes after being
ſeparated from the body. <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0823900106:250"/> Another method of taking him,
is by ſtriking a barbed inſtrument, called a fizgig, into his body, as he
bruſhes along by the ſide of the ſhip. As ſoon as he is taken up, to
prevent his flouncing, they cut off the tail with an ax, with the utmoſt
expedition.</p>
                  <p>This is the manner in which Europeans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſhark;
but ſome of the Negroes along the African coaſt, take a bolder and more
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous method to combat their terrible enemy. Armed with nothing more than
a knife, the Negroe plunges into the water, where he ſees the ſhark
watching for his prey, and boldly ſwims forward to meet him; though the great
animal does not come to provoke the combat, he does not avoid it, and ſuffers
the man to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him; but juſt as he turns upon his ſide to ſeize the
aggreſſor, the Negroe watches the opportunity, plunges his knife in the
fiſh's belly, and purſues his blows with ſuch ſucceſs that he lays
the ravenous tyrant dead at the bottom: he ſoon however returns, fixes the
fiſh's head in a nooze, and drags him to ſhore, where he makes a noble
feaſt for the adjacent villages.</p>
                  <p>Nor is man alone the only enemy this fiſh has to fear: the
Remora, or Sucking Fiſh, is probably a ſtill greater, and follows the
ſhark <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0823900106:251"/> every where. This fiſh has got a power of
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to whatever it ſticks againſt, in the ſame manner as a
cupping-glaſs ſticks to the human body. It is by ſuch an apparatus that
this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſticks to the ſhark, and drains away its moiſture. The
ſeamen, however, are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it is ſeen to attend on the ſhark
for more friendly purpoſes, to point him to his prey, and to apprize him of
his danger. For this reaſon it has been called the Shark's Pilot.</p>
                  <p>The ſhark ſo much reſembles the whale in ſize, that
ſome have injudiciouſly ranked it in the claſs of cetaceous fiſhes: but
its real rank is in the place here aſſigned it, among thoſe of the
cartilaginous kind. It breathes with gills and lungs, its bones are griſtly,
and it brings forth ſeveral living young; Belonius aſſures us, that he
ſaw a female ſhark produce eleven live young ones at a time. But I will not
take upon me to vouch for the veracity of Rondeletius, who, when talking of the
blue ſhark, ſays, that the female will permit her ſmall brood, when in
danger, to ſwim down her mouth, and take ſhelter in her belly. Mr. Penant
indeed, ſeems to give credit to the ſtory, and thinks that this fiſh,
like the Oppoſſum, may have a place fitted by Nature for the reception of
her young. To his opinion much deference is due, and is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, 
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0823900106:252"/> at leaſt, to make us ſuſpend our aſſent; for
nothing is ſo contemptible as that affectation of wiſdom which ſome
diſplay, by univerſal incredulity.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, a ſhark, when living, is a very formidable
animal; and, when dead, is of very little value. The fleſh is hardly
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible by any but the Negroes, who are fond of it to diſtraction; the
liver affords three or four quarts of oil; ſome imaginary virtues have been
aſcribed to the brain; and its ſkin is, by great labour, poliſhed into
that ſubſtance called ſhagreen. Mr. Penant is of opinion, that the female
is larger than the male in all this tribe; which would, if confirmed by
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, make a ſtriking agreement between them and birds of prey. It
were to be wiſhed that ſucceeding hiſtorians would examine into this
obſervation, which is offered only as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture!</p>

Kind.</head>
                  <p>THE ſame rapacity which impels the ſhark along the
ſurface of the water, actuates the flat fiſh at the bottom. Leſs active
and leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, they creep in ſecurity along the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, ſeize
every thing that comes in their way; neither the hardeſt ſhells nor the
ſharpeſt ſpines give protection to the animals that bear them; their
inſatiable hunger is ſuch, that they devour all; and the force of their
ſtomach is ſo great, that it eaſily digeſts them.</p>
                  <p>The whole of this kind reſemble each other very ſtrongly
in their figure; nor is it eaſy without experience to diſtinguiſh one
from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſtranger to this dangerous tribe may imagine he is only
handling a ſkate when he is inſtantly ſtruck numb by the torpedo; he may
ſuppoſe he has caught a thornback till he is ſtung by the fire-flare. It
will be proper, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after deſcribing the general figure of theſe
animals, to mark their differences.</p>
                  <p>All fiſh of the ray kind are broad, cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
ſwimming flat on the water, and having ſpines on different parts of their
body, or at <pb facs="tcp:0823900106:254"/>

tail. They all have their eyes and mouth placed quite under the body, with
apertures for breathing either about or near them. They all have teeth, or a
rough bone, which anſwers the ſame purpoſe. Their bowels are very wide
towards the mouth, and go on diminiſhing to the tail. The tail is very
differently ſhaped from that of other fiſhes; and at firſt ſight more
reſembling that of a quadrupede, being narrow, and ending either in a bunch
or a point. But what they are chiefly diſtinguiſhed by is their ſpines or
prickles, which the different ſpecies have on different parts of their body.
Some are armed with ſpines both above and below; others have them on the
upper part only; ſome have their ſpines at the tail; ſome have three rows
of them, and others but one. Theſe prickles in ſome are comparatively
ſoft and feeble; thoſe of others, ſtrong and piercing. The ſmalleſt
of theſe ſpines are uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining towards the tail; the larger
towards the head.</p>
                  <p>It is by the ſpines that theſe animals are
diſtinguiſhed from each other. The ſkate has the middle of the back
rough, and a ſingle row of ſpines on the tail. The ſharp noſed ray has
ten ſpines that are ſituated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle of the back. The rough ray
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0823900106:258"/> has its ſpines ſpread indiſcriminately over the
the whole back. The thorn-back has its ſpines diſpoſed in three rows upon
the back. The fire flare has but one ſpine, but that indeed a terrible one.
This dangerous weapon is placed on the tail, about four iches from the body,
and is not leſs than five inches long. It is of a flinty hardneſs, the
ſides thin, ſharp pointed, and cloſely and ſharply bearded the whole
way. The laſt of this tribe that I ſhall mention is the torpedo; and this
animal has no ſpines that can wound; but in the place of them it is
poſſeſſed of one of the moſt potent and extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in
nature.</p>
                  <p>Such are the principal differences that may enable us to
diſtinguiſh animals, ſome of which are of very great uſe to mankind,
from others that are terrible and noxious. With reſpect to their uſes
indeed, as we ſhall ſoon ſee, they differ much; but the ſimilitude
among them, as to their nature, appetites, and conformation, is perfect and
entire. They are all as voracious as they are plenty; and as dangerous to a
ſtranger as uſeful to him who can diſtinguiſh their differences.</p>
                  <p>Of all the larger fiſh of the ſea, theſe are the moſt
numerous; and they owe their numbers to their ſize. Except the white ſhark
and cacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot alone, there is no other fiſh that has a ſwallow 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0823900106:259"/> large enough to take them in; and their ſpines make
them a ſtill more dangerous morſel. Yet the ſize of ſome is ſuch,
that even the ſhark himſelf is unable to devour them: we have ſeen ſome
of them in England weigh above two hundred pounds; but that is nothing to their
enormous bulk in other parts of the world. Labat tells us of a prodigious ray
that was ſpeared by the Negroes at Guadaloupe, which was thirteen feet eight
inches broad, and above ten feet from the ſnout to the inſertion of the
tail. The tail itſelf was in proportion, for it was no leſs than fifteen
feet long; twenty inches broad at its inſertion, and tapering to a point. The
body was two feet in depth; the ſkin as thick as leather, and marked with
ſpots; which ſpots, in all of this kind, are only glands, that ſupply a
mucous to lubricate and ſoften the ſkin. This enormous fiſh was utterly
unfit to be eaten by the Europeans; but the Negroes choſe out ſome of the
niceſt bits, and carefully ſalted them up as a moſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
proviſion.</p>
                  <p>Yet, large as this may ſeem, it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that we
have ſeen only the ſmalleſt of the kind; as they generally keep at the
bottom, the largeſt of the kind are ſeldom ſeen; and, as they may
probably have been growing for ages, the extent of their magnitude is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0823900106:260"/> It is generally ſuppoſed, however, that they are the
largeſt inhabitants of the deep; and, were we to credit the Norway Biſhop,
there are ſome above a mile over. But to ſuppoſe an animal of ſuch
magnitude is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; yet the over-ſtretching the ſuppoſition does not
deſtroy the probability that animals of this tribe grow to an enormous
ſize.</p>
                  <p>The ray generally chuſes for its retreat ſuch parts of the
ſea as have a black muddy bottom; the large ones keep at greater depths; but
the ſmaller approach the ſhores, and feed upon whatever living animals they
can ſurprize, or whatever putrid ſubſtances they meet with. As they are
ravenous, they eaſily take the bait, yet will not touch it if it be taken up
and kept a day or two out of water. Almoſt all fiſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear much more
delicate with regard to a baited hook than their ordinary food. They appear by
their manner to perceive the line and to dread it; but the impulſe of their
hunger is too great for their caution; and, even though they perceive the
danger, if thoroughly hungry, they devour the deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Theſe fiſh generate in March and April; at which time only
they are ſeen ſwimming near the ſurface of the water, ſeveral of the
males purſuing one female. They adhere ſo faſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0823900106:261"/> in coition, that the fiſhermen frequently draw up both
together, though only one has been hooked. The females are prolific to an
extreme degree; there having been no leſs than three hundred eggs taken out
of the body of a ſingle ray. Theſe eggs are covered with a tough horny
ſubſtance, which they acquire in the womb; for before they deſcend into
that, they are attached to the ovary pretty much in the ſame manner as in the
body of a pullet. From this ovary, or egg-bag, as it is vulgarly called, the
fiſh's eggs drop one by one into the womb, and there receive a ſhell by the
concretion of the fluids of that organ. When come to the proper maturity, they
are excluded, but never above one or two at a time, and often at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of
three or four hours. Theſe eggs, or purſes, as the fiſhermen call them,
are uſually caſt about the beginning of May, and they continue caſting
during the whole ſummer. In October, when their breeding ceaſes, they are
exceedingly poor and thin; but in November they begin to improve, and grow
gradually better till May, when they are in the higheſt perfection.</p>
                  <p>It is chiefly during the winter ſeaſon that our
fiſhermen take them; but the Dutch, who are indefatigable, begin their
operations earlier, <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0823900106:262"/> and fiſh with better ſucceſs
than we. The method practiſed by the fiſhermen of Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough is thought
to be the beſt among the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh; and, as Mr. Penant has given a very
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct account of it, I will take leave to preſent it to the reader.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <q rend="inline"> "When they go out to fiſh, each perſon is
provided with three lines: each man's lines are fairly coiled upon a flat
oblong piece of wicker work; the hooks being baited and placed very regularly
in the centre of the coil. Each line is furniſhed with two hundred and eighty
hooks, at the diſtance of ſix feet two inches from each other. The hooks
are faſtened to lines of twiſted horſe-hair, twenty-ſeven inches in
length. 
<p> "When fiſhing, there are always three men in each coble;
and conſequently nine of theſe lines are faſtened together and uſed as
one line, extending in length near three miles, and furniſhed with above two
thouſand five hundred hooks. An anchor and a buoy are fixed at the firſt
end of the line, and one more at each end of each man's lines: in all, four
anchors, and four buoys made of leather or cork. The line is always laid
acroſs the current. The tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon
our coaſt; and, when <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0823900106:263"/> undiſturbed by winds, run each
way about ſix hours. They are ſo rapid that the fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can only
ſhoot and haul their lines at the turn of the tide; and therefore the lines
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remain upon the ground about ſix hours. The ſame rapidity of tide
prevents their uſing hand lines; and therefore two of the people commonly
wrap themſelves in the ſail and ſleep, while the other keeps a ſtrict
look-out, for fear of being run down by ſhips, and to obſerve the weather:
for ſtorms often riſe ſo ſuddenly, that it is ſometimes with extreme
difficulty they eſcape to the ſhore, though they leave lines behind
them.</p> 
                        <p> "The coble is twenty feet ſix inches long, and five feet
extreme breadth. It is about one ton burthen, rowed with three pair of oars,
and admirably conſtructed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of encountering a mountainous
ſea. They hoiſt ſail when the wind ſuits.</p> 
                        <p> "The five-men-boat is forty feet long, fifteen broad, and
twenty-five tons burthen. It is ſo called, though navigated by ſix men and
a boy; becauſe one of the men is hired to cook, and does not ſhare in the
profits with the other five. All our able fiſhermen go in theſe boats to
the herring-fiſhery at Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, the latter end of September, and 
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0823900106:264"/> return about the middle of November. The boats are then
laid up until the beginning of Lent, at which time they go off in them to the
edge of the Dogger, and other places, to fiſh for turbot, cod, ling,
ſkates, &amp;c. They always take two cobles on board, and when they come upon
their ground, anchor the boat, throw out the cobles, and fiſh in the ſame
manner as thoſe do who go from the ſhore in a coble; with this difference
only, that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines, and,
inſtead of waiting the return of the tide in the coble, return to the boat
and bait their other lines; thus hawling one ſet, and ſhooting another,
every turn of tide. They commonly run into the harbour twice a week, to deliver
their fiſh. The five-men-boat is decked at each end, but open in the middle,
and has two long ſails.</p> 
                        <p> "The beſt bait for all kinds of fiſh, is freſh herring
cut in pieces of a proper ſize; and, notwithſtanding what has been ſaid
to the contrary, they are taken there at any time in the winter, and all the
ſpring, whenever the fiſhermen put down their nets for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: the
five-men boats always take ſome nets for that end. Next to herrings are the 
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0823900106:265"/> leſſer lampreys, which come all winter by
land-carriage from Tadcaſter. The next baits in eſteem are ſmall haddocks
cut in pieces, ſand worms, muſcles and limpets; and laſtly, when none of
theſe can be found, they uſe bullock's liver. The hooks uſed there are
much ſmaller than thoſe employed at Iceland and Newfoundland. Experience
has ſhewn that the larger fiſh will take a living ſmall one upon the
hook, ſooner than any bait that can be put on; therefore they uſe ſuch as
the fiſh can ſwallow. The hooks are two inches and an half long in the
ſhank; and near an inch wide between the ſhank and the point. The line is
made of ſmall cording, and is always tanned before it is uſed. All the rays
and turbots are extremely delicate in their choice of baits: if a piece of
herring or had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock has been twelve hours out of the ſea, and then uſed as
a bait, they will not touch it."</p>
                     </q> 
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is the manner of fiſhing for thoſe fiſh that
uſually keep near the bottom on the coaſts of England; and Duhamel
obſerves, that the beſt weather for ſucceeding, is a half calm, when the
waves are juſt curled with a ſilent breeze.</p>
                  <p>But this extent of line, which runs, as we have ſeen, three
miles along the bottom, is <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0823900106:266"/> nothing to what the Italians
throw out in the Mediterranean. Their fiſhing is carried on in a tartan,
which is a veſſel much larger than our's; and they bait a line of no leſs
than twenty miles long, with above ten or twelve thouſand hooks. This line is
called the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſina; and the fiſhing goes by that of the pielago. This
line is not regularly drawn every ſix hours, as with us, but remains for
ſome time in the ſea; and it requires the ſpace of twenty-four hours to
take it up in. By this apparatus they take rays, ſharks, and other fiſh;
ſome of which are above a thouſand pound weight. When they have caught any
of this magnitude, they ſtrike them through with an harpoon to bring them on
board, and kill them as faſt as they can.</p>
                  <p>This method of catching fiſh is obviouſly fatiguing and
dangerous; but the value of the capture generally repays the pain. The ſkate
and the thornback are very good food; and their ſize, which is from ten
pounds to two hundred weight, very well rewards the trouble of fiſhing for
them. But it ſometimes happens that the lines are viſited by very unwelcome
intruders; by the rough ray, the fireflare, or the torpedo. To all theſe the
fiſhermen have the moſt mortal antipathy; and, when diſcovered, 
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0823900106:267"/> ſhudder at the ſight: however, they are not always
ſo much upon their guard, but that they ſometimes feel the different
reſentments of this angry tribe; and, inſtead of a prize, find they have
caught a vindictive enemy. When ſuch is the caſe, they take care to throw
them back into the ſea with the ſwifteſt expedition.</p>
                  <p>The rough ray inflicts but ſlight wounds with the prickles
with which its whole body is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. To the ignorant it ſeems
harmleſs, and a man would at firſt ſight venture to take it in his hand,
without any apprehenſions; but he ſoon finds, that there is not a ſingle
part of its body that is not armed with ſpines; and that there is no way of
ſeizing the animal, but by the little fin at the end of the tail.</p>
                  <p>But this animal is harmleſs, when compared to the Fireflare,
which ſeems to be the dread of even the boldeſt and moſt experienced
fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The weapon with which Nature has armed this animal, which grows
from the tail, and which we deſcribed as barbed and five inches long, hath
been an inſtrument of terror to the ancient fiſhermen as well as the
moderns: and they have delivered many tremendous fables of its aſtoniſhing
effects. Pliny, Aelian, and Oppian, have ſupplied it with a venom that
affects even the inanimate creation: trees that <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0823900106:268"/> are
ſtruck by it, inſtantly loſe their verdure; and rocks themſelves are
incapable of reſiſting the potent poiſon. The enchantreſs Circe armed
her ſon with a ſpear headed with the ſpine of the trygon, as the moſt
irreſiſtible weapon ſhe could furniſh him with; a weapon that ſoon
after was to be the death of his own father.</p>
                  <p>That ſpears and darts, ſays Mr. Penant, might in very
early times have been headed with this bone inſtead of iron, we have no
doubt. The Americans head their arrows with the bones of fiſhes to this day;
and from their hardneſs and ſharpneſs, they are no contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible weapons.
But that this ſpine is poſſeſſed of thoſe venomous qualities
aſcribed to it, we have every reaſon to doubt; though ſome men of high
reputation, and the whole body of fiſhermen, contend for its venomous
effects. It is, in fact, a weapon of offence belonging to this animal, and
capable, from its barbs, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting a very terrible wound, attended with
dangerous ſymptoms; but it cannot be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of any poiſon, as
the ſpine has no ſheath to preſerve the ſuppoſed venom on its
ſurface; and the animal has no gland that ſeparates the noxious fluid:
beſides, all thoſe animals that are furniſhed with envenomed fangs or
ſtings, ſeem to have them ſtrongly connected with their ſafety and
exiſtence; they never part with them; there <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0823900106:269"/> is an
apparatus of poiſon prepared in the body to accompany their exertions; and
when the fangs or ſtings are taken away, the animal languiſhes and dies.
But it is otherwiſe with the ſpine of the fireflare; it is fixed to the
tail, as a quill is into the tail of a fowl, and is annually ſhed in the
ſame manner: it may be neceſſary for the creature's defence, but is no
way neceſſary for its exiſtence. The wound inflicted by an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's
tail, has ſomething terrible in the idea, and may from thence alone be
ſuppoſed to be fatal. From hence terror might have added poiſon to the
pain, and called up imagined dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: the Negroes univerſally believe that
the ſting is poiſonous; but they never die of the wound; for, by opening
the fiſh, and laying it to the part injured, it effects a ſpeedy cure. The
ſlightneſs of the remedy proves the innocence of the wound.</p>
                  <p>The Torpedo is an animal of this kind, equally formidable and
well known with the former; but the manner of its operating, is to this hour a
myſtery to mankind. The body of this fiſh is almoſt circular, and thicker
than others of the ray kind; the ſkin is ſoft, ſmooth, and of a
yellowiſh colour, marked, as all the kind, with large annular ſpots; the
eyes very ſmall; the tail tapering to a point; and the weight 
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0823900106:270"/> of the fiſh from a quarter to fifteen pounds. Redi
found one twenty-four pounds weight. To all outward appearance, it is
furniſhed with no extraordinary powers; it has no muſcles formed for
particularly great exertions; no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conformation perceptibly differing
from he reſt of its kind: yet ſuch is that unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable power it
poſſeſſes, that, the inſtant it is touched, it numbs not only the
hand and arm, but ſometimes alſo the whole body. The ſhock received, by
all accounts, moſt reſembles the ſtroke of an electrical machine;
ſudden, tingling, and painful. 
<q rend="inline">"The inſtant," ſays Kempfer, "I touched it
with my hand, I felt a terrible numbneſs in my arm, and as far up as the
ſhoulder. Even if one treads upon it with the ſhoe on, it affects not only
the leg, but the whole thigh upwards. Thoſe who touch it with the foot, are
ſeized with a ſtronger palpitation than even thoſe who touched it with
the hand. This numbneſs bears no reſemblance to that which we feel when a
nerve is a long time preſſed, and the foot is ſaid to be aſleep; it
rather appears like a ſudden vapour, which paſſing through the pores in
an inſtant, penetrates to the very ſprings of life, from whence it
diffuſes itſelf over the whole body, and gives real pain. The nerves are
ſo affected, that the perſon <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0823900106:271"/> ſtruck imagines all
the bones of his body, and particularly thoſe of the limb that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the
blow, are driven out of joint. All this is accompanied with an univerſal
tremor, a ſickneſs of the ſtomach, a general convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a total
ſuſpenſion of the faculties of the mind. In ſhort," continues Kempfer,
"ſuch is the pain, that all the force of our promiſes and authority could
not prevail upon a ſea man to undergo the ſhock a ſecond time. A Negroe
indeed, that was ſtanding by, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily undertook to touch the torpedo; and
was ſeen to handle it without feeling any of its effects. He informed us,
that his whole ſecret conſiſted in keeping in his breath; and we found,
upon trial, that this method anſwered with ourſelves. When we held in our
breath, the torpedo was harmleſs; but when we breathed ever ſo little, its
efficacy took place."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Kempfer has very well deſcribed the effects of this animal's
ſhock; but ſucceeding experience has abundantly convinced us, that holding
in the breath, no way guards againſt its violence. Thoſe, therefore, who,
depending on that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, ſhould play with a torpedo, would ſoon find
themſelves painfully undeceived: not but that this fiſh may be many times
touched with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0823900106:272"/> ſecurity; for it is not upon
every occaſion that it exerts its potency. Reaumur, who made ſeveral trials
upon this animal, has at leaſt convinced the world that it is not
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, but by an effort, that the torpedo numbs the hand of him that
touches it. He tried ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and could eaſily tell when the fiſh
intended the ſtroke, and when it was about to continue harmleſs. Always
before the fiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſtroke, it flattened the back, raiſed the
head and the tail, and then, by a violent contraction in the oppoſite
direction, ſtruck with its back againſt the preſſing finger, and the
body, which before was flat, became humped and round.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt not infer, as he has done, that the whole effect
of this animal's exertions ariſe from the greatneſs of the blow which the
fingers receive at the inſtant they are ſtruck. We will, with him, allow,
that the ſtroke is very powerful, equal to that of a muſquet-ball, ſince
he will have it ſo; but it is very well known, that a blow, though never ſo
great on the points of the fingers, diffuſes no numbneſs over the whole
body: ſuch a blow might break the ends of the fingers indeed, but would
hardly numb the ſhoulder. Thoſe blows that numb, muſt be applied
immediately to ſome <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0823900106:273"/> great and leading nerves, or to a
large ſurface of the body; a powerful ſtroke applied to the points of the
fingers will be exceſſively painful indeed, but the numbneſs will not
reach beyond the fingers themſelves. We muſt, therefore, look for another
cauſe producing the powerful effects wrought by the torpedo.</p>
                  <p>Others have aſcribed it to a tremulous motion which this
animal is found to poſſeſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembling that of an horſe's
ſkin, when ſtung by a fly. This operating under the touch with an amazing
quickneſs of vibration, they ſuppoſe produces the uneaſy ſenſation
deſcribed above; ſomething ſimilar to what we feel when we rub pluſh
cloth againſt the grain. But the cauſe is quite diſproportioned to the
effect; and ſo much beyond our experience, that this ſolution is as
difficult as the wonder we want to explain.</p>
                  <p>The moſt probable ſolution ſeems to be, that the ſhock
proceeds from an animal electricity, which this fiſh has ſome hidden power
of ſtoring up, and producing on its moſt urgent occaſions. The ſhocks
are entirely ſimilar; the duration of the pain is the ſame: but how the
animal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives to renew the charge, how it is prevented from evaporating it
on contiguous objects, how it is originally procured, theſe are difficulties
that time alone can elucidate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0823900106:274"/>But to know even the effects is
wiſdom. Certain it is that the powers of this animal ſeem to decline with
its vigour; for as its ſtrength ceaſes, the force of the ſhock ſeems to
diminiſh; till, at laſt, when the fiſh is dead, the whole power is
deſtroyed, and it may be handled or eaten with perfect ſecurity: on the
contrary, when immediately taken out of the ſea, its force is very great, and
not only affects the hand, but if even touched with a ſtick, the perſon
finds himſelf ſometimes affected. This power, however, is not to be
extended to the degree that ſome would have us believe; as reaching the
fiſhermen at the end of the line, or numbing fiſhes in the ſame pond.
Godig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, in his Hiſtory of Abyſſinia, carries this quality to a moſt
ridiculous exceſs: he tells us of one of theſe that was put into a baſket
among a number of dead fiſhes, and that the next morning the people, to their
utter aſtoniſhment, perceived, that the torpedo had actually numbed the
dead fiſhes into life again.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, it is generally ſuppoſed that the female
torpedo is much more powerful than the male. Lorenzini, who has made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
experiments upon this animal, ſeems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that its power wholly
reſides in two thin muſcles that cover a part of the back. 
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0823900106:275"/> Theſe he calls the trembling fibres; and he
aſſerts that the animal may be touched with ſafety in any other part. It
is now known alſo that there are more fiſh than this of the ray kind,
poſſeſſed of the numbing quality, which has acquired them the name of
the torpedo. Theſe are deſcribed by Atkins and Moore, and found in great
abundance along the coaſt of Africa. They are ſhaped like a mackarel,
except that the head is much larger; the effects of theſe ſeem alſo to
differ in ſome reſpects. Moore talks of keeping his hand upon the animal;
which in the ray torpedo it is actually impoſſible to do. 
<q rend="inline">"There was no man in the company," ſays he,
"that could bear to keep his hand on this animal the twentieth part of a
minute, it gave him ſo great pain; but upon taking the hand away, the
numbneſs went off, and all was well again. This numbing quality continued in
this torpedo even after it was dead; and the very ſkin was ſtill
poſſeſſed of its extraordinary power till it became dry."</q> Condamime
informs us of a fiſh poſſeſſed of the powers of the torpedo, of a
ſhape very different from the former, and every way reſembling a lamprey.
This animal, if touched by the hand, or even with a ſtick, inſtantly
benumbs the hand and arm to the very ſhoulder; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0823900106:276"/> the man falls down under the blow. Theſe animals,
therefore, muſt affect the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſyſtem in a different manner from the
former, both with reſpect to the manner and the intention; but how this
effect is wrought, we muſt be content to diſmiſs in obſcurity.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Lamprey and its Affinities.</head>
                  <p>THERE is a ſpecies of the Lamprey ſerved up as a great
delicacy among the modern Romans, very different from ours. Whether theirs be
the murena of the ancients I will not pretend to ſay; but there is nothing
more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than that our lamprey is not. The Roman lamprey agrees with the
ancient fiſh in being kept in ponds, and conſidered by the luxurious as a
very great delicacy.</p>
                  <p>The lamprey known among us is differently eſtimated,
according to the ſeaſon in which it is caught, or the place where it has
been fed. Thoſe that leave the ſea to depoſit their ſpawn in freſh
waters are the beſt; thoſe that are entirely bred in our rivers, and that
have never been at ſea, are conſidered as much inferior to the former.
Thoſe that are taken in the months of March, April, or May, juſt upon their
leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſea, are reckoned very good; thoſe that are caught after they
have caſt their ſpawn, are found to be flabby and of little value. Thoſe
caught in ſeveral of the rivers in Ireland the people will not venture to
touch; thoſe <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0823900106:278"/> of the Engliſh Severn are conſidered
as the moſt delicate of all other fiſh whatever.</p>
                  <p>The lamprey much reſembles an eel in its general appearance,
but is of a lighter colour, and rather a clumſier make. It differs however in
the mouth, which is round, and placed rather obliquely below the end of the
noſe. It more reſembles the mouth of a leech than an eel; and the animal
has a hole on the top of the head through which it ſpouts water, as in the
ceta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous kind. There are ſeven holes on each ſide for reſpiration; and
the ſins are formed rather by a lengthening out of the ſkin, than any ſet
of bones or ſpines for that purpoſe. As the mouth is formed reſembling
that of a leech, ſo it has a property reſembling that animal of ſticking
cloſe to and ſucking any body it is applied to. It is extraordinary the
power they have of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to ſtones; which they do ſo firmly as not to
be drawn off without ſome difficulty. We are told of one that weighed but
three pound; and yet it ſtuck ſo firmly to a ſtone of twelve pounds, that
it remained ſuſpended at its mouth, from which it was ſeparated with no
ſmall difficulty. This amazing power of ſuction is ſuppoſed to ariſe
from the animal's exhauſting the air within its body by the hole over the
noſe, while the mouth is cloſely fixed <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0823900106:279"/> to the
object, and permits no air to enter. It would be eaſy to determine the weight
this animal is thus able to ſuſtain; which will be equal to the weight of a
column of air of equal diameter with the fiſh's mouth.</p>
                  <p>From ſome peculiarity of formation, this animal ſwims
generally with its body as near as poſſible to the ſurface; and it might
eaſily be drowned by being kept by force for any time under water. Muralto
has given us the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of this animal; but, in a very minute deſcription,
makes no mention of lungs. Yet I am very apt to ſuſpect, that two red
glands tiſſued with nerves, which he deſcribes as lying towards the back
of the head, are no other than the lungs of this animal. The abſolute
neceſſity it is under of breathing in the air, convinces me that it muſt
have lungs, though I do not know of any anatomiſt that has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
them.</p>
                  <p>The adheſive quality in the lamprey may be in ſome
meaſure encreaſed by that ſlimy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with which its body is all
over ſmeared; a ſubſtance that ſerves at once to keep it warm in its
cold element, and alſo to keep its ſkin ſoft and pliant. This mucous is
ſeparated by two long lymphatic canals, that extend on each ſide from the
head to the tail, and that furniſh <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0823900106:280"/> it in great
abundance. As to its inteſtines, it ſeems to have but one great bowel,
running from the mouth to the vent, narrow at both ends, and wide in the
middle.</p>
                  <p>So ſimple a conformation ſeems to imply an equal
ſimplicity of appetite. In fact, the lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey's food is either ſlime and
water, or ſuch ſmall water-inſects as are ſcarce perceivable. Perhaps
its appetite may be more active at ſea, of which it is properly a native; but
when it comes up into our rivers, it is hardly perceived to devour any
thing.</p>
                  <p>Its uſual time of leaving the ſea, which it is annually
ſeen to do in order to ſpawn, is about the beginning of ſpring; and after
a ſtay of a few months it returns again to the ſea. Their preparation for
ſpawning is peculiar; their manner is to make holes in the gravelly bottom of
rivers; and on this occaſion their ſucking power is particularly
ſerviceable; for if they meet with a ſtone of a conſiderable ſize, they
will remove it and throw it out. Their young are produced from eggs in the
manner of flat fiſh; the female remains near the place where they are
excluded, and continues with them till they come forth. She is ſometimes
ſeen with her whole family playing about her; and after ſome time ſhe
conducts them in triumph back to the ocean.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0823900106:281"/>But ſome have not ſufficient
ſtrength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and theſe continue in the freſh water till they die.
Indeed, the life of this fiſh, according to Rondeletius, who has given its
hiſtory, is but of very ſhort continuance; and a ſingle brood is the
extent of the female's fertility. As ſoon as ſhe has returned after
caſting her eggs, ſhe ſeems exhauſted and flabby. She becomes old
before her time; and two years is generally the limit of her exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>However this may be, they are very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eating after
they have caſt their eggs, and particularly at the approach of hot weather.
The beſt ſeaſon for them is the months of March, April, and May; and they
are uſually taken in nets with ſalmon, and ſometimes in baſkets at the
bottom of the river. It has been an old cuſtom for the city of Glouceſter,
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to preſent the king with a lamprey-pye; and as the gift is made at
Chriſtmaſs, it is not without great difficulty the corporation can procure
the proper quantity, though they give a guinea a piece for taking them.</p>
                  <p>How much they were valued among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, or a fiſh
bearing ſome reſemblance to them, appears from all the claſſics that
have praiſed good living or ridiculed gluttony. One ſtory we are told of
this fiſh with which I will <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0823900106:282"/> conclude its hiſtory. A
ſenator of Rome, whoſe name does not deſerve being tranſmitted to
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, was famous for the delicacy of his lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preys. Tigelinus,
Manucius, and all the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated epicures of Rome, were loud in his praiſes:
no man's fiſh had ſuch a flavour, was ſo nicely fed, or ſo exactly
pickled. Auguſtus, hearing ſo much of this man's entertainments, deſired
to be his gueſt; and ſoon found that fame had been juſt to his merits;
the man had indeed very fine lampreys, and of an exquiſite flavour. The
emperor was deſirous of knowing the method by which he fed his fiſh to ſo
fine a reliſh; and the glutton, making no ſecret of his art, informed him
that his way was to throw into his ponds ſuch of his ſlaves as had at any
time diſpleaſed him. Auguſtus, we are told, was not much pleaſed with
his receipt; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ordered all his ponds to be filled up. The
ſtory would have ended better if he had ordered the owner to be flung in
alſo.</p>

                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0823900106:284"/> THE Sturgeon, with a form as terrible
and a body as large as the ſhark, is yet as harmleſs as the fiſh we have
been juſt deſcribing; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable and unwilling to injure others, it flies
from the ſmalleſt fiſhes, and generally falls a victim to its own
timidity.</p>
                  <p>The ſturgeon in its general form reſembles a freſh-water
pike. The noſe is long; the mouth is ſituated beneath, being ſmall, and
without jaw-bones or teeth. But, though it is ſo harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ill provided
for war, the body is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable enough to appearance. It is long, pentagonal,
and covered with five rows of large bony knobs, one row on the back and two on
each ſide, and a number of fins to give it greater expedition. Of this fiſh
there are three kinds; the Common Sturgeon, the Caviar Sturgeon, and the Huſo
or Iſinglaſs fiſh. The firſt has eleven knobs or ſcales on the back;
the ſecond has fifteen; and the latter thirteen on the back and forty-three
on the tail. Theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences ſeem ſlight to us who only conſider the
animal's form; but thoſe who conſider its uſes <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0823900106:285"/>
find the diſtinction of conſiderable importance. The firſt is the
ſturgeon, the fleſh of which is ſent pickled into all parts of Europe.
The ſecond is the fiſh from the roe of which that noted delicacy called
caviar is made; and the third, beſides ſupplying the caviar, furniſhes
alſo the valuable commodity of iſinglaſs. They all grow to a very great
ſize; and ſome of them have been found above eighteen feet long.</p>
                  <p>There is not a country in Europe but what this fiſh viſits
at different ſeaſons; it annually aſcends the largeſt rivers to
ſpawn, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagates in an amazing number. The inhabitants along the banks
of the Po, the Danube, and the Walga, make great profit yearly of its
incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions up the ſtream, and have their nets pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for its reception.
The ſturgeon alſo is brought daily to the markets of Rome and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, and
they are known to abound in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean ſea. Yet thoſe fiſh that
keep entirely either in ſalt or freſh water are but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſmall.
When the ſturgeon enjoys the viciſſitude of freſh and ſalt water, it
is then that it grows to an enormous ſize, ſo as almoſt to rival even the
whale in magnitude.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we without frequent viſits from this much eſteemed
fiſh in England. It is often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally taken in our rivers in
ſalmon-nets, <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0823900106:286"/> particularly in thoſe parts that are
not far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the ſea. The largeſt we have heard of caught in
Great-Britain was a fiſh taken in the Eſke, where they are moſt
frequently found, which weighed four hundred and ſixty pounds. An enormous
ſize to thoſe who have only ſeen our freſh-water fiſhes!</p>
                  <p>North-America alſo furniſhes the ſturgeon; their rivers
in May, June, and July, ſupply them in very great abundance. At that time
they are ſeen ſporting in the water, and leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from its ſurface
ſeveral yards into the air. When they fall again on their ſides, the
concuſſion is ſo violent, that the noiſe is heard in ſtill weather at
ſome miles diſtance.</p>
                  <p>But of all places where this animal is to be found, it appears
no where in ſuch numbers as in the Lakes of Friſchehaff and Curiſchaff,
near the city of Pillau. In the rivers alſo that empty themſelves into the
Euxine Sea this fiſh is caught in great numbers, particularly at the mouth of
the river Don. In all theſe places the fiſhermen regularly expect their
arrival from the ſea, and have their nets and ſalt ready prepared for their
reception.</p>
                  <p>As the ſturgeon is an harmleſs fiſh and no way
voracious, it is never caught by a bait in the ordinary manner of fiſhing,
but always in <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0823900106:287"/> nets. From the deſcription given above
of its mouth, it is not to be ſuppoſed that the ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon would ſwallow
any hook capable of holding ſo large a bulk and ſo ſtrong a ſwimmer. In
fact, it never attempts to ſeize any of the finny tribe, but lives by rooting
at the bottom of the ſea, where it makes inſects and ſea-plants its whole
ſubſiſtence. From this quality of floun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at the bottom it has
received its name; which comes from the German verb <hi>ſtoeren,</hi>
ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying to wallow in the mud. That it lives upon no large animals is
obvious to all thoſe who cut it open, where nothing is found in its ſtomach
but a kind of ſlimy ſubſtance, which has induced ſome to think it lives
only upon water and air. From hence there is a German proverb, which is applied
to a man extremely temperate, when they ſay he is as moderate as a
ſturgeon.</p>
                  <p>As the ſturgeon is ſo temperate in its appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, ſo is
it alſo equally timid in its nature. There would be ſcarce any method of
taking it did not its natural deſire of propagation induce it to incur ſo
great a variety of dangers. The ſmalleſt fiſh is alone ſufficient to
terrify a ſhoal of ſturgeons; for, being unfurniſhed with any weapon of
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, they are obliged to truſt to their ſwiftneſs and their caution
for ſecurity. Like all animals <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0823900106:288"/> that do not make war
upon others, ſturgeons live in ſociety among themſelves; rather for the
purpoſes of pleaſure, than from any power of mutual protection. Geſner
even aſſerts, that they are delighted with ſounds of various kinds; and
that he has ſeen them ſhoal together, at the notes of a trumpet.</p>
                  <p>The uſual time, as was ſaid before, for the ſturgeon to
come up rivers to depoſit its ſpawn, is about the beginning of ſummer,
when the fiſhermen of all great rivers make a regular preparation for its
reception. At Pillau par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the ſhores are formed into diſtricts,
and allotted to companies of fiſhermen, ſome of which are rented for about
three hundred pounds a year. The nets in which the ſturgeon are caught, are
made of ſmall cord, and placed acroſs the mouth of the river; but in ſuch
a manner that, whether the tide ebbs or flows, the pouch of the net goes with
the ſtream. The ſturgeon thus caught, while in the water, is one of the
ſtrongeſt fiſhes that ſwims, and often breaks the net to pieces that
encloſes it; but the inſtant it is raiſed with its head above water, all
its activity ceaſes: it is then a lifeleſs, ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs lump, and
fuffers itſelf to be tamely drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on ſhore. It has been found prudent,
however, to draw it to ſhore gently; for, if <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0823900106:289"/> excited
by any unneceſſary violence, it has been found to break the fiſhermen's
legs with a blow of its tail. The moſt experienced fiſhers, therefore, when
they have drawn it to the brink, keep the head ſtill elevated, which prevents
its doing any miſchief with the hinder part of the body: others, by a nooze,
faſten the head and the tail together; and thus, without immediately
diſpatching it, bring it to the market, if there be one near; or keep it till
their number is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted for exportation.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of this animal pickled is very well known at all
the tables of Europe; and is even more prized in England, than in any of the
countries where it is uſually caught. The fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen have two different
methods of preparing it. The one is by cutting it in long pieces lengthwiſe,
and having ſalted them, by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up in the ſun to dry: the fiſh
thus prepared is ſold in all the countries of the Levant, and ſupplies the
want of better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. The other method, which is uſually practiſed
in Holland, and along the ſhores of the Baltic, is to cut the ſturgeon
croſswiſe into ſhort pieces, and put it into ſmall barrels, with a
pickle made of ſalt and ſaumure. This is the ſturgeon which is ſold in
England; and of which great quantities came from the north, 
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0823900106:290"/> until we gave encouragement to the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it
from North America. From thence we are very well ſupplied; but it is ſaid,
not with ſuch good fiſh as thoſe imported from the north of Europe.</p>
                  <p>A very great trade is alſo carried on with the roe of the
ſturgeon, preſerved in a particular manner, and called Caviar: it is made
from the roe of all kinds of ſturgeon, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the ſecond. This
is much more in requeſt in other countries of Europe than with us. To all
theſe high reliſhed meats, the appetite muſt be formed by degrees; and
though formerly even in England it was very much in requeſt at the politeſt
tables, it is at preſent ſunk entirely into difuſe. It is ſtill,
however, a conſiderable merchandize among the Turks, Greeks, and Venetians.
Caviar ſomewhat reſembles ſoft ſoap in conſiſtence; but it is of a
brown, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form colour, and is eaten as cheeſe with bread. The manner of
making it is this: they take the ſpawn from the body of the
ſturgeon—for it is to be obſerved that the ſturgeon differs from
other cartilaginous fiſh, in that it has ſpawn like a cod, and not eggs
like a ray.—They take the ſpawn, I ſay, and freeing it from the
ſmall membranes that connect it together, they waſh it with vinegar, and
afterwards ſpread it <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0823900106:291"/> to dry upon a table; they then
put it into a veſſel with ſalt, breaking the ſpawn with their hands,
and not with a peſtle; this done, they put it into a canvas bag, letting the
liquor drain from it; laſtly, they put it in a tub, with holes in the bottom,
ſo that, if there be any moiſture ſtill remaining, it may run out: then
it is preſſed down, and covered up cloſe for uſe.</p>
                  <p>But the Huſo or Iſinglaſs Fiſh furniſhes a ſtill
more valuable commodity. This fiſh is caught in great quantities in the
Danube, from the months of October to January: it is ſeldom under fifty
pounds weight, and often above four hundred: its fleſh is ſoft, glutinous
and flabby; but it is ſometimes ſalted, which makes it better taſted, and
then it turns red like ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. It is for the commodity it furniſhes that
it is chiefly taken. Iſinglaſs is of a whitiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, enclining
to yellow, done up into rolls, and ſo exported for uſe. It is very well
known as ſerviceable not only in medicine, but many arts. The varniſher,
the wine-merchant, and even the clothier know its uſes; and very great ſums
are yearly expended upon this ſingle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of commerce. The manner of
making it is this: they take the ſkin, the entrails, the fins and the tail of
this fiſh, and cut them into ſmall pieces; theſe are left to macerate in
a ſufficient <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0823900106:292"/> quantity of warm water, and they are all
boiled ſhortly after with a ſlow fire, until they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and
reduced to a jelly; this jelly is ſpread upon inſtruments made for the
purpoſe, ſo, that drying, it aſſumes the form of parchment, and, when
quite dry, it is then rolled into the form which we ſee it in the
ſhops.</p>
                  <p>This valuable commodity is principally fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from
Ruſſia, where they prepare great quantities ſurprizingly cheap. Mr.
Jackſon, an ingenious countryman of our own, found out an obvious method of
making a glue at home that anſwered all the purpoſes of iſinglaſs; but
what with the trouble of making it, and perhaps the arts put in practice to
underſell him, he was, as I am told, obliged to diſcontinue the improvement
of his diſcovery. Indeed, it is a vain attempt to manufacture among
ourſelves thoſe things which may be more naturally and cheaply ſupplied
elſewhere. We have many traders that are unnaturally, if I may ſo expreſs
it, employed among us; who furniſh more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſly thoſe
neceſſaries with which other countries could eaſily and cheaply ſupply
us. It would be wiſer to take what they can thus produce; and to turn our
artizans to the encreaſe and manufacture of ſuch productions as thrive more
readily among us. Were, for inſtance, <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0823900106:293"/> the number of
hands that we have now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the manufacture of ſilk, turned to the
encreaſe of agriculture, it is probable that the encreaſed quantity of corn
thus produced, would be more than an equivalent for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of national
wealth in purchaſing wrought ſilk from other countries.</p>

                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0823900106:295"/>OF all others, the cartilaginous claſs
ſeems to abound with the greateſt variety of ill-formed animals; and, if
philoſophy could allow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, we might ſay, that the
cartilaginous claſs was the claſs of monſters: in fact, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits a
variety of ſhapeleſs beings, the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of which from the uſual form
of fiſhes are beyond the power of words to deſcribe, and ſcarcely of the
pencil to draw. In this claſs we have the Pipe Fiſh, that almoſt tapers
to a thread, and the Sun Fiſh, that has the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a bulky head, but
the body cut off in the middle; the Hippocampus, with an head ſomewhat like
that of an horſe, and the Water Bat, whoſe head can ſcarcely be
diſtinguiſhed from the body. In this claſs we find the Fiſhing Frog,
which from its deformity ſome have called the Sea Devil, the Chimaera, the
Lump Fiſh, the Sea Porcupine, and the Sea Snail. Of all theſe the hiſtory
is but little known; and naturaliſts ſupply the place with
deſcription.</p>
                  <p>The Sun Fiſh ſometimes grows to a very 
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0823900106:296"/> large ſize; one taken near Plymouth was five hundred
weight. In form it reſembles a bream, or ſome deep fiſh cut off in the
middle: the mouth is very ſmall, and contains in each jaw two broad teeth,
with ſharp edges: the colour of the back is duſky and dappled, and the
belly is of a ſilvery white. When boiled, it has been obſerved to turn to a
glutinous jelly, and would moſt probably ſerve for all the purpoſes of
iſinglaſs, were it found in ſufficient plenty.</p>
                  <p>The Fiſhing Frog in ſhape very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a tadpole
or young frog, but then a tadpole of enormous ſize, for it grows to above
five feet long, and its mouth is ſometimes a yard wide. Nothing can exceed
its deformity. The head is much bigger than the whole body; the under jaw
projects beyond the upper, and both are armed with rows of ſlender, ſharp
teeth: the palate and the tongue are furniſhed with teeth in like manner; the
eyes are placed on the top of the head, and are encompaſſed with prickles:
immediately above the noſe are two long beards or filaments, ſmall in the
beginning, but thicker at the end, and round: theſe, as it is ſaid,
anſwer a very ſingular purpoſe; for being made ſomewhat reſembling a
fiſhing-line, it is aſſerted, that the animal converts them to the
purpoſes of fiſhing. With theſe extended, as <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0823900106:297"/> Pliny
aſſerts, the fiſhing frog hides in muddy waters, and leaves nothing but
the beards to be ſeen; the curioſity of the ſmaller fiſh bring them to
view theſe filaments, and their hunger induces them to ſeize the bait; upon
which the animal in ambuſh inſtantly draws in its filaments with the little
fiſh that had taken the bait, and devours it without mercy. This ſtory,
though apparently improbable, has found credit among ſome of our beſt
naturaliſts; but what induces me to doubt the fact is, that there is another
ſpecies of this animal that has no beards, which it would not want if they
were neceſſary to the exiſtence of the kind. Rondeletius informs us, that
if we take out the bowels, the body will appear with a kind of tranſparence;
and that if a lighted candle be placed within the body, as in a lanthorn, the
whole has a very formidable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The fiſhermen, however, have in
general a great regard for this ugly fiſh, as it is an enemy to the dog
fiſh, the bodies of thoſe fierce and voracious animals being often found in
its ſtomach: whenever they take it, therefore, they always ſet it at
liberty.</p>
                  <p>The Lump Fiſh is trifling in ſize, compared to the former:
its length is but ſixteen inches, and its weight about four pounds; the
ſhape of the body is like that of a bream, deep, and it <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0823900106:298"/> ſwims edgeways; the back is ſharp and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and the belly
flat; the lips, mouth and tongue of this animal are of a deep red; the whole
ſkin is rough, with bony knobs, the largeſt row is along the ridge of the
back; the belly is of a bright crimſon colour: but what makes the chief
ſingularity in this fiſh, is an oval aperture in the belly, ſurrounded
with a fleſhy, ſoft ſubſtance, that ſeems bearded all round; by means
of this part it adheres with vaſt force to any thing it pleaſes. If flung
into a pail of water, it will ſtick ſo cloſe to the bottom, that on
taking the fiſh by the tail, one may lift up pail and all, though it holds
ſeveral gallons of water. Great numbers of theſe fiſh are found along the
coaſts of Greenland in the beginning of ſummer, where they reſort to
ſpawn. Their roe is remarkably large, and the Greenlanders boil it to a pulp
for eating. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fat, but not admired in England, being both
flabby and inſipid.</p>
                  <p>The Sea Snail takes its name from the ſoft and unctuous
texture of its body, reſembling the ſnail upon land. It is almoſt
tranſparent, and ſoon diſſolves and melts away. It is but a little
animal, being not above five inches long. The colour, when freſh taken, is of
a pale brown, the ſhape of the body round, and the <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0823900106:299"/>
back fin reaches all the way from the head to the tail. Beneath the throat is a
round de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, of a whitiſh colour, ſurrounded by twelve brown
ſpots, placed in a circle. It is taken in England at the mouths of rivers,
four or five miles diſtant from the ſea.</p>
                  <p>The body of the Pipe Fiſh, in the thickeſt part, is not
thicker than a ſwan-quill, while it is above ſixteen inches long. This is
angular, but the angles being not very ſharp, they are not diſcernable
until the fiſh is dried. Its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral colour is an olive brown, marked with
numbers of bluiſh lines, pointing from the back to the belly. It is
viviparous; for, on cruſhing one that was juſt taken, hundreds of very
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute young ones were obſerved to crawl about.</p>
                  <p>The Hippocampus, which from the form of its head ſome call
the Sea Horſe, never exceeds nine inches in length. It is about as thick as a
man's thumb, and the body is ſaid, while alive, to have hair on the fore
part, which falls off when it is dead. The ſnout is a ſort of a tube with a
hole at the bottom, to which there is a cover, which the animal can open and
ſhut at pleaſure. Behind the eyes there are two fins, which look like ears;
and above them are two holes, which ſerve for reſpiration. The whole body
ſeems to be compoſed of cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0823900106:300"/> rings, on the
intermediate membranes of which ſeveral ſmall prickles are placed. It is
found in the Mediterranean, and alſo in the Weſtern Ocean; and, upon the
whole, more reſembles a great caterpillar than a fiſh. The antients
conſidered it as extremely venomous; probably induced by its peculiar
figure.</p>
                  <p>From theſe harmleſs animals, covered with a ſlight coat
of mail, we may proceed to others, more thickly defended, and more formidably
armed, whoſe exact ſtation in the ſcale of fiſhes is not yet
aſcertained. While Linnaeus ranks them among the Cartilaginous kinds, a later
naturaliſt places them among the Spinous claſs. With which tribe they
moſt agree, ſucceeding obſervations muſt determine. At preſent, we
ſeem better acquainted with their figure than their hiſtory: their
deformity is obvious; and the venemous nature of the greateſt number, has
been confirmed by fatal experience. This circumſtance, as well as the happy
diſtance at which they are placed from us, being all found in the Oriental or
American ſeas, may have prevented a more critical enquiry; ſo that we know
but little of the nature of their malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſtill leſs of their
purſuits and enmities in the deep.</p>

                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0823900106:302"/> Sea Orb, which is almoſt
round, has a mouth like a frog, and is from ſeven inches to two feet long.
Like the porcupine, from whence it ſometimes takes its name, being alſo
called the Sea Porcupine, it is covered over with long thorns or prickles,
which point on every ſide; and, when the animal is enraged, it can blow up
its body as round as a bladder. Of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary creature there are many
kinds: ſome threatening only with ſpines, as the Sea Hedge-hog; others
defended with a bony hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met that covers the head, as the Oſtracion; others
with a coat of mail from the head to the tail, where it terminates in a point,
as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſcus; and others ſtill armed offenſively and defenſively
with bones and ſpines, as the Shield Orb.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe ſcarce one is without its peculiar weapon of
offence. The centriſcus wounds with its ſpine; the oſtracion poiſons
with its venom; the orb is impregnable, and is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely poiſonous, if
eaten. Indeed, their figure is not ſuch as would tempt one to make the
experiment; and the natives of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they are ſound, are
careful to inform foreigners of their danger: yet a certain ſailor at the
Cape of Good Hope, not believing what the Dutch told him concerning their
venom, <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0823900106:303"/> was reſolved to make the experiment, and break
through a prejudice which he ſuppoſed was founded on the animal's
deformity. He tried and eat one; but his raſhneſs coſt him his life; he
inſtantly fell ſick, and died a few days after.</p>
                  <p>Theſe frightful animals are of different ſizes; ſome not
bigger than a foot-ball, and others as large as a buſhel. They almoſt all
flatten and erect their ſpines at pleaſure, and encreaſe the terrors of
their appearance in proportion to the approach of danger. At firſt they
ſeem more inoffenſive; their body oblong, with all their weapons pointing
towards the tail; but upon being provoked or alarmed, the body that before
ſeemed ſmall ſwells to the view; the animal viſibly grows rounder and
larger, and all its prickles ſtand upright, and threaten the invader on every
ſide. The Americans often amuſe themſelves with the barren pleaſure of
catching theſe frightful creatures by a line and hook baited with a piece of
ſea-crab. The animal approaches the bait with its ſpines flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened; but
when hooked and ſtopped by the line, ſtraight all its ſpines are erected;
the whole body being armed in ſuch a manner at all points, that it is
impoſſible to lay hold of it on any part. For this reaſon it is dragged
to ſome diſtance from the water, and there it quickly <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0823900106:304"/> expires. In the middle of the belly of all theſe there is a ſort
of bag or bladder filled with air, and by the inflation of which the animal
ſwells itſelf in the manner already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>In deſcribing the deformed animals of this claſs, one is
ſometimes at a loſs whether it be a fiſh or an inſect that lies before
him. Thus the hippocampus and the pipe-fiſh bear a ſtrong reſemblance to
the caterpillar and the worm; while the leſſer orb bears ſome likeneſs
to the claſs of ſea-eggs to be deſcribed after. I will conclude this
account of cartilaginous fiſhes with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of an animal which I
would ſcarcely call a fiſh, but that Father Labat dignifies it with the
name. Indeed, this claſs teems with ſuch a number of odd ſhaped animals,
that one is prompted to rank every thing extraordinary of the finny ſpecies
among the number; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Labat ſays its bones are cartilaginous, and
that may entitle it to a place here.</p>
                  <p>The animal I mean is the Galley Fiſh, which Linnaeus
degrades into the inſect tribe, under the title of the Meduſa, but which I
chuſe to place in this tribe, from its habits that are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſimilar.
To the eye of an unmindful ſpectator, this fiſh ſeems a tranſparent
bubble ſwimming on the ſurface of the ſea, or like a bladder variouſly
and beautifully painted with <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0823900106:305"/> vivid colours, where red
and violet predominate as variouſly oppoſed to the beams of the ſun. It
is however an actual fiſh; the body of which is compoſed of cartilages, and
a very thin ſkin filled with air, which thus keeps the animal floating on the
ſurface as the waves and the winds happen to drive. Sometimes it is ſeen
thrown on the ſhore by one wave, and again waſhed back into the ſea by
another. Perſons who happen to be walking along the ſhore often happen to
tread upon theſe animals; and the burſting of their body yields a report
like that when one treads upon the ſwim of a fiſh. It has eight broad feet
with which it ſwims, or which it expands to catch the air as with a ſail.
It faſtens itſelf to whatever it meets by means of its legs, which have an
adheſive quality. Whether they move when on ſhore Labat could never
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, though he did every thing to make them ſtir; he only ſaw that it
ſtrongly adhered to whatever ſubſtances he applied it. It is very common
in America, and grows to the ſize of a gooſe egg, or ſomewhat more. It is
perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſeen floating; and no efforts that are uſed to hurt it can
ſink it to the bottom. All that appears above water is a bladder clear and
tranſparent as glaſs, and ſhining with the moſt beautiful colours of
the rainbow. Beneath, in <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0823900106:306"/> the water, are four of the feet
already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that ſerve as oars, while the other four are expanded
above to ſail with. But what is moſt remarkable in this extraordinary
creature is the violent pungency of the ſlimy ſubſtance with which its
legs are ſmeared. If the ſmalleſt quantity but touch the ſkin, ſo
cauſtic is its quality, that it burns it like hot oil dropped on the part
affected. The pain is worſt in the heat of the day, but ceaſes in the cool
of the evening. It is from feeding on theſe that he thinks the poiſonous
quality contracted by ſome Weſt-Indian fiſh may be accounted for. It is
certain theſe animals are extremely common along all the coaſts in the Gulf
of Mexico; and whenever the ſhore is covered with them in an unuſual
manner, it is conſidered as a certain fore-runner of a ſtorm.</p>

                     <p>From the great variety in this claſs, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious how
difficult a taſk it muſt have been to deſcribe or remember even a part of
what it contains. When ſix hundred different ſorts of animals offer
themſelves to conſideration, the mind is bewildered in the multiplicity of
objects that all lay ſome claim to its attention. To obviate this
confuſion, ſyſtems have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, which, throwing ſeveral
fiſhes that agree in many particulars into one groupe, and thus uniting all
into ſo many particular bodies, the mind that was incapable of ſeparately
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering each, is enabled to comprehend all when thus offered in larger
maſſes to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, of all the beings in animated nature, fiſhes
moſt demand a ſyſtematical arrangement. Quadrupedes are but few, and can
be all known; birds, from their ſeldom varying in their ſize, can be very
tolerably diſtinguiſhed without ſyſtem; but among fiſhes, which no
ſize can diſcriminate, where the animal ten inches and the animal ten feet
long is entirely the ſame, there muſt be ſome other criterion by which
they are to be diſtinguiſhed; ſomething that gives preciſion to our
ideas of the animal whoſe hiſtory we deſire to know.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0823900106:309"/>Of the real hiſtory of fiſhes,
very little is yet known; but of very many we have full and ſufficient
accounts, as to their external form. It would be unpardonable, therefore, in an
hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of theſe animals, not to give the little we do know; and, at
leaſt, arrange our forces, though we cannot tell their deſtination. In this
art of arrangement, Artedi and Linnaeus have long been conſpicuous: they have
both taken a view of the animal's form in different lights; and, from the parts
which moſt ſtruck them, have founded their reſpective ſyſtems.</p>
                     <p>Artedi, who was foremoſt, perceiving that ſome fiſhes
had hard prickly fins, as the pike; that others had ſoft pliant ones, as the
herring; and that others ſtill wanted that particular fin, by which the gills
are opened and ſhut, as the eel, made out a ſyſtem from theſe
varieties. Linnaeus, on the other hand, rejecting this ſyſtem, which he
found liable to too many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, conſidered the fins, not with regard to
their ſubſtance, but their poſition. The ventral fins ſeem to be the
great object of his ſyſtem; he conſiders them in fiſhes ſupplying the
ſame offices as feet in quadrupedes; and from their total abſence, or from
their being ſituated nearer the head or the tail, in different fiſhes, he
takes the differences of his ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0823900106:310"/>Theſe arrangements, which are
totally ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and which are rather a method than a ſcience, are always
fluctuating; and the laſt is generally preferred to that which went before.
There has lately appeared, however, a ſyſtem, compoſed by Mr. Gouan of
Montpellier, that deſerves applauſe for more than its novelty. It appears
to me the beſt arrangement of this kind that ever was made; and in it the
diviſions are not only preciſely ſyſtematical, but in ſome meaſure
adopted by nature itſelf. This learned French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has united the ſyſtems
of Artedi and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus together; and by bringing one to correct the other, has
made out a number of tribes, that are marked with the utmoſt preciſion. A
part of his ſyſtem, however, we have already gone through in the
cartilaginous, or, as he calls a part of them, the <hi>branchioſtegous</hi>
tribe of fiſhes. In the arrangement of theſe I have followed Linnaeus, as
the number of them was but ſmall, and his method ſimple. But in that which
is more properly called the Spinous claſs of fiſhes, I will follow Mr.
Gouan's ſyſtem; the terms of which, as well as of all the former
ſyſtems, require ſome explanation. I do not love to multiply the
technical terms of a ſcience; but it often happens that names, by being long
uſed, are as neceſſary to be known as the ſcience itſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0823900106:311"/>If we conſider the ſubſtance of
the fin of a fiſh, we ſhall find it compoſed, beſides the ſkin,
either of ſtraight, hard, pointed, bony prickles or ſpines, as in the pike;
or of ſoft, crooked or forked bones, or cartilages, as in the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The
fiſh that have bony prickly fins, are called Prickly Finned Fiſh; the
latter, that have ſoft or cartilaginous fins, are called, Soft Finned Fiſh.
The prickly finned fiſh have received the Greek new-formed name of
<hi>Acan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thopterigii</hi>; the ſoft finned fiſh have likewiſe their
barbarous Greek name of <hi>Malacopterigii.</hi> Thus far Artedi has ſupplied
Mr. Gouan with names and diviſions. All Spinous fiſh are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into
Prickly finned fiſh, and Soft finned fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Again, Linnaeus has taught him to remark the ſituation of
the fins: for the ventral or belly fins, which are thoſe particularly to be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, are either wholly wanting, as in the eel, and then the fiſh is
called <hi>Apodal</hi> (a Greek word ſignifying without feet); or the ventral
fins are placed more forward than the pectoral fins, as in the haddock, and
then the animal is called a <hi>Jugular</hi> fiſh; or the ventral fins are
placed directly under the pectoral fins, as in the father-laſher, and then it
is called a <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racic</hi> fiſh: or, laſtly, the ventral fins are
placed <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0823900106:312"/> nearer the tail than the pectoral fins, as in the
minow, and then it is an <hi>Abdominal</hi> fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Poſſeſſed of theſe diſtributions, the French
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt mixes and unites them into two grand diviſions. All the prickly
finned fiſh make one general diviſion; all the ſoft finned fiſh
another. Theſe firſt are diſtinguiſhed from each other, as being either
<hi>apodal, jugular, thoracic</hi> or <hi>abdominal.</hi> Thus there are
prickly finned <hi>apodal</hi> fiſhes; prickly finned <hi>jugular</hi>
fiſhes, prickly finned <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racic</hi> fiſhes, and prickly finned
<hi>abdominal</hi> fiſhes. On the other hand, the ſoft finned fiſhes fall
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſimilar diſtribution, and make the other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diviſion. Thus
there are ſoft finned <hi>apodal</hi> fiſhes, ſoft finned
<hi>jugular</hi> fiſhes, ſoft finned <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racic</hi> fiſhes, and
ſoft finned <hi>abdominal</hi> fiſhes. Theſe general characters are
ſtrongly marked, and eaſily remembered. It only remains, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to
divide theſe into ſuch tribes as are moſt ſtrongly marked by nature;
and to give the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct characters of each, to form a complete ſyſtem
with great ſimplicity. This Mr. Gouan has done; and the tribes into which he
has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed each of theſe diviſions, exactly amount to fifty. Thus
the reader, who can contain in his memory the characteriſtic marks of fifty
kinds, will have a tolerable idea of the form of every kind of ſpinous
fiſh. I ſay, of the form; for <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0823900106:313"/> as to the hiſtory
and the nature of the animal itſelf, that can only be obtained by experience
and information.</p>

                        <p>Such is the ſyſtem of Mr Gouan; by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to which
any fiſh that offers, we can know its rank, its affinities, and partly its
anatomy, all which make a conſiderable part in its natural hiſtory. But, to
ſhew the uſe of this ſyſtem ſtill more apparently, ſuppoſe I meet
with a fiſh, the name to me unknown, of which I deſire to know ſomething
more. The way is firſt to ſee whether it be a cartilaginous fiſh, which
may be known by its wanting fins to open and ſhut the gills, which the
cartilaginous kinds are wholly without. If I find that it has them, then it is
a ſpinous fiſh; and, in order to know its kind, I examine its fins, whether
they be prickly or ſoft: I find them ſoft; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ranked
among the ſoft finned fiſhes. I then examine its ventral or belly fins, and
finding that the fiſh has them, I look for their ſituation, and find they
lie nearer to the tail than the pectoral fins. By this I find the animal to be
a ſoft finned abdominal fiſh. Then, to know which of the kinds of theſe
fiſhes it is, I examine its figure and the ſhape of its head, I find the
body rather oblong; the head with a <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0823900106:324"/> ſmall beak; the
lower jaw like a ſaw; the fin covering the gills with eight rays. This animal
muſt therefore be the herring, or one of that family, ſuch as the pilchard,
the ſprat, the ſhad, or the anchovy. To give another inſtance: Upon
examining the fins of a fiſh to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, I find them prickly; I then
lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>k for the ſituation of the
ventral fins, I find them entirely wanting; this then muſt be a prickly
finned apodal fiſh. Of this kind there are but three; and by comparing the
fiſh with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, I find it either of the trichurus kind, the
ſword-fiſh, or the gilt head. Upon examining alſo its internal
ſtructure, I ſhall find a very great ſimilitude between my fiſh and
that placed at the head of the family.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of Spinous Fiſhes in General.</head>
                  <p>HAVING given a method by which ſpinous fiſhes may be
diſtinguiſhed from each other, the hiſtory of each in particular might
natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be expected to follow: but ſuch a diſtinct account of each would
be very diſguſting, from the unavoidable uniformity of every deſcription.
The hiſtory of any one of this claſs very much reſembles that of all the
reſt: they breathe air and water through the gills; they live by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
each devouring ſuch animals as its mouth is capable of admitting; and they
propagate, not by bringing forth their young alive, as in the cetaceous tribes,
nor by diſtinct eggs, as in the generality of the cartilaginous tribes, but
by ſpawn, or peas, as they are generally called, which they produce by
hundreds of thouſands. Theſe are the leading marks that run through their
whole hiſtory, and which have ſo much ſwelled books with tireſome
repetition.</p>
                  <p>It will be ſufficient therefore to draw this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
claſs into one point of view, and to mark how they differ from the former
claſſes; and what they poſſeſs peculiarly ſtriking, ſo as 
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0823900106:326"/> to diſtinguiſh them from each other. The firſt
object that preſents itſelf, and that by which they differ from all others,
are the bones. Theſe, when examined but ſlightly, appear to be entirely
ſolid; yet, when viewed more cloſely, every bone will be found hollow, and
filled with a ſubſtance leſs rancid and oily than mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Theſe bones
are very numerous, and pointed; and, as in quadrupedes, are the props or
ſtays to which the muſcles are fixed which move the different parts of the
body.</p>
                  <p>The number of bones in all ſpinous fiſhes of the ſame
kind, is always the ſame. It is a vulgar way of ſpeaking to ſay, that
fiſhes are at ſome ſeaſons more bony than at others; but this ſcarce
requires contradiction. It is true indeed, that fiſh are at ſome
ſeaſons much fatter than at others; ſo that the quantity of the fleſh
being diminiſhed, and that of the bones remaining the ſame, they appear to
encreaſe in number, as they actually bear a greater proportion.</p>
                  <p>All fiſh of the ſame kind, as was ſaid, have the ſame
number of bones: the ſkeleton of a fiſh, however irregularly the bones may
fall in our way at table, has its members very regularly diſpoſed; and
every bone has its fixed place, with as much preciſion as we find in the
orders of a regular fabric. But then ſpinous fiſh differ 
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0823900106:327"/> in the number of bones according to the ſpecies; for
ſome have a greater number of fins by which they move in the water. The
number in each is always in proportion to the number and ſize of theſe
fins: for every fiſh has a regular apparatus of bones and muſcles, by which
the fins are moved; and all thoſe fiſh where they are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or large,
muſt, of conſequence, be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably bony. Indeed, in the larger
fiſh, the quantity of fleſh is ſo much, and the bones themſelves are
ſo large, that they are eaſily ſeen and ſeparated: but in the ſmaller
kinds with many fins, the bones are as numerous as in the great; yet being ſo
very minute, they lurk almoſt in every part of the fleſh, and are dangerous
as well as troubleſome to be eaten. In a word, thoſe fiſh which are
large, fat, and have few fins, are found to be the leaſt bony; thoſe which
are ſmall, lean, and have many fins, are the moſt bony of all others. Thus,
for inſtance, a roach appears more bony than a carp, becauſe it is leaner
and ſmaller; and it is actually more bony than an eel, becauſe it has a
greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fins.</p>
                  <p>As the ſpinous fiſh partake leſs of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupede in
their formation than any others, ſo they can bear to live out of their own
element a ſhorter time. In general, when taken out of <pb n="320" facs="tcp:0823900106:328"/>
the water, they teſtify their change by panting more violently and at
cloſer intervals, the thin air not furniſhing their gills the proper play;
and in a few minutes they expire. Some indeed are more vivacious in air than
others; the eel will live ſeveral hours out of water; and the carp has been
known to be fattened in a damp cellar. The method is by placing it in a net
well wrapped up in wet moſs, the mouth only out, and then hung up in a vault.
The fiſh is fed with white bread and milk; and the net now and then plunged
into the water. The animal, thus managed, has been known not only to live for a
fortnight, but to grow exceedingly fat, and of a ſuperior flavour. From this
it would ſeem, that the want of moiſture in the gills, is the chief cauſe
of the death of theſe animals; and could that be ſupplied, their lives
might be prolonged in the air, almoſt as well as in their own element.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is impoſſible to account for the different
operations of the ſame element, upon animals, that, to appearance, have the
ſame conformation. To ſome fiſhes, bred in the ſea, freſh water is
immediate deſtruction: on the other hand, ſome fiſhes, that live in our
lakes and ponds, cannot bear the ſalt water. Whence this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference can
ariſe, is not eaſy to be accounted <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0823900106:329"/> for. The ſaline
quality of the water cannot properly be given as the cauſe; ſince no
fiſhes imbibe any of the ſea's ſaltneſs with their food, or in
reſpiration. The fleſh of all fiſhes is equally freſh, both in the
river, and at the ſalteſt depths of the ocean; the ſalt of the element in
which they live, no way mixing with their conſtitution. Whence then is it
that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals will live only there; and will quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, when carried into
freſh water? It may probably ariſe from the ſuperior weight of the
ſea-water. As from the great quantity of ſalt diſſolved in its
compoſition, it is much heavier than freſh water, ſo it is probable it
lies with greater force upon the organs of reſpiration, and gives them their
proper and neceſſary play: on the other hand, thoſe fiſh which are
uſed only to freſh water, cannot bear the weight of the ſaline fluid, and
expire in a manner ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated in the groſsneſs of the ſtrange
element.</p>
                  <p>But though there are ſome tribes that live only in the
ſea, and others only in freſh water, yet there are ſome whoſe organs
are equally adapted to either element; and that ſpend a part of their
ſeaſon in one, and a part in the other. Thus the ſalmon, the ſhad, the
ſmelt, and the flounder, annually quit their native ocean, and come up our
rivers to depoſite their <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0823900106:330"/> ſpawn. This ſeems the
moſt important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their lives; and there is no danger which
they will not encounter, even to the ſurmounting precipices, to find a proper
place for the depoſition of their future offspring. The ſalmon, upon
theſe occaſions, is ſeen to aſcend rivers five hundred miles from the
ſea; and to brave not only the danger of various enemies, but alſo to
ſpring up cataracts as high as a houſe. As ſoon as they come to the
bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the torrent, they ſeem diſappointed to meet the obſtruction,
and ſwim ſome paces back: they then take a view of the danger that lies
before them, ſurvey it motionleſs for ſome minutes, advance, and again
retreat; till at laſt ſummoning up all their force, they take a leap from
the bottom, their body ſtraight, and ſtrongly in motion; and thus moſt
frequently clear every obſtruction. It ſometimes happens, however, that
they want ſtrength to make the leap; and then, in our fiſheries, they are
taken in their deſcent. But this is one of the ſmalleſt dangers that
attend theſe adventuring animals in their progreſs: numberleſs are the
methods of taking them; as well by the hook, as by nets, baſkets, and other
inventions, which it is not our buſineſs here to deſcribe. Their capture
makes, in ſeveral countries, a great article of commerce; and being cured in

                  <p>As theſe mount up the rivers to depoſite their ſpawn,
others, particularly the eel, deſcend the freſh water ſtream, as Redi
aſſures us, to bring forth their young in the ſea. About the month of
Auguſt, annually, theſe animals take the opportunity of the moſt
obſcure nights, and when the rivers are flooded by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental rains, ſeek
the ocean. When they have reached the ſea, and produced their young, for they
are viviparous, they again aſcend the ſtream, at different times, as
opportunity offers, or as the ſeaſon is favourable or tempeſtuous. Their
paſſage begins uſually about the end of January, and continues till
towards the end of May, when they are taken in the river Arno by millions, and
ſo ſmall that a thouſand of them goes to a pound. There is nothing more
certain than, that they deſcend in our own rivers after floods, in great
abundance, and are thus caught in nets, to very great advantage. They are
poſſeſſed alſo of a power of climbing over any obſtacle; for, by
applying their glutinous and ſlimy bodies to the ſurface of the object they
deſire to ſurmount, they can thus creep up locks, weirs, and every thing
that would prevent their aſcending the current of the ſtream.</p>

                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:0823900106:333"/>But the length of the voyage performed
by theſe fiſhes, is ſport, if compared to what is annually undertaken by
ſome tribes, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſide in the ocean. Theſe are known to
take a courſe of three or four thouſand miles in a ſeaſon; ſerving
for prey to whales, ſharks, and the numerous flocks of water-fowl, that
regularly wait to intercept their progreſs. Theſe may be called fiſh of
paſſage, and bear a ſtrong analogy to birds of paſſage, both from
their ſocial diſpoſition, and the immenſity of their numbers. Of this
kind are the cod, the haddock, the whiting, the mackrel, the tunny, the
herring, and the pilchard. Other fiſh live in our vicinity, and reſide on
our coaſts all the year round; or keep in the depths of the ocean, and are
but ſeldom ſeen: but theſe, at ſtated ſeaſons, viſit their
accuſtomed haunts with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular certainty, generally returning the ſame
week in the ſucceeding year, and often the ſame day.</p>
                  <p>The ſtated returns, and the regular progreſs of theſe
fiſh of paſſage, is one of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary circumſtances in
all the hiſtory of nature. What it is that impels them to ſuch diſtant

are queſtions that curioſity may aſk, but philoſophy can hardly
reſolve. We muſt diſmiſs enquiry, ſatisfied with the certainty of the
facts.</p>
                  <p>The cod ſeems to be the foremoſt of this wandering tribe;
and is only found in our northern part of the world. This animal's chief place
of reſort is on the banks of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland, and the other ſand banks that
lie off Cape-Breton. That extenſive flat ſeems to be no other than the
broad top of a ſea-mountain, extending for above five hundred miles long, and
ſurrounded with a deeper ſea. Hither the cod annually repair in numbers
beyond the power of calculation, to feed on the quantity of worms that are to
be found there in the ſandy bottom. Here they are taken in ſuch quantities,
that they ſupply all Europe with a conſiderable ſhare of proviſion. The
Engliſh have ſtages erected all along the ſhore for ſalting and drying
them; and the fiſhermen, who take them with the hook and line, which is their
method, draw them in as faſt as they can throw out. This immenſe capture,
however, makes but a very ſmall diminution, when compared to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
and when their proviſion there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, or the ſeaſon for
propagation returns, they go off to the polar ſeas, where they depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite 
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0823900106:336"/> their roes in full ſecurity. From thence want of food
forces them, as ſoon as the firſt more ſouthern ſeas are open, to
repair ſouthward for ſubſiſtence. Nor is this fiſh an unfrequent
viſitant upon our own ſhores: but the returns are not ſo regular, nor
does the capture bear any proportion to that at Newfoundland.</p>
                  <p>The haddock, the whiting, and the mackrel, are thought, by
ſome, to be driven upon our coaſts rather by their fears than their
appetites; and it is to the purſuit of larger fiſhes, we owe their welcome
viſits. It is much more probable, that they come for that food which is found
in more plenty near the ſhore, than farther out at ſea One thing is
remarkable, that their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations ſeem to be regularly conducted. The grand
ſhoal of haddocks that comes periodically on the Yorkſhire coaſts,
appeared there in a body on the tenth of December, 1766; and exactly on the
ſame day, in the following year. This ſhoal extended from the ſhore near
three miles in breadth, and in length for more than forty. The limits of a
ſhoal are preciſely known; for if the fiſhermen put down their lines at
the diſtance of more than three miles from ſhore, they catch nothing but
dog fiſh: a proof that the haddock is not there.</p>
                  <p>But of all migrating fiſh, the herring and the pilchard take
the moſt adventurous voyages. <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0823900106:337"/> Herrings are found in
the greateſt abundance in the higheſt northern latitudes. In thoſe
inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible ſeas, that are covered with ice for a great part of the
year, the herring and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard find a quiet and ſure retreat from all their
numerous enemies: thither neither man, nor their ſtill more deſtructive
enemy, the fin fiſh, or the cachalot, dares to purſue them. The quantity of
inſect food which thoſe ſeas ſupply, is very great; whence, in that
remote ſituation, defended by the icy rigour of the climate, they live at
eaſe, and multiply beyond expreſſion. From this moſt deſirable
retreat, Anderſon ſuppoſes, they would never depart, but that their
numbers render it neceſſary for them to migrate; and, as with bees from a
hive, they are compelled to ſeek for other retreats.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon, the great colony is ſeen to ſet out
from the icy ſea about the middle of winter; compoſed of numbers, that if
all the men in the world were to be loaded with her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, they would not carry
the thouſandth part away. But they no ſooner leave their retreats, but
millions of enemies appear to thin their ſquadrons. The fin-fiſh and the
cachalot ſwallow barrels at a yawn; the porpus, the grampus, the ſhark, and
the whole numerous tribe of dog-fiſh, find them an eaſy prey, and 
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0823900106:338"/> deſiſt from making war upon each other: but ſtill
more, the unnumbered flocks of ſea-fowl that chiefly inhabit near the pole,
watch the outſet of their dangerous migration, and ſpread extenſive
ruin.</p>
                  <p>In this exigence, the defenceleſs emigrants find no other
ſafety but by crouding cloſer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and leaving to the outmoſt bands
the danger of being the firſt devoured; thus, like ſheep when frighted,
that always run together in a body, and each finding ſome protection in being
but one of many that are equally liable to invaſion, they are ſeen to
ſeparate into ſhoals, one body of which moves to the weſt, and pours down
along the coaſts of America, as far ſouth as Carolina, and but ſeldom
farther. In Cheſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peak Bay, the annual inundation of theſe fiſh is ſo
great, that they cover the ſhores in ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites as to become a
nuiſance. Thoſe that hold more to the eaſt, and come down towards
Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, endeavour to ſave themſelves from their mercileſs purſuers, by
approaching the firſt ſhore they can find; and that which firſt offers in
their deſcent, is the coaſt of Iceland, in the beginning of March. Upon
their arrival on that coaſt, their phalanx, which has already ſuffered
conſiderable diminutions, is nevertheleſs of amazing extent, depth, and
cloſeneſs, covering <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0823900106:339"/> an extent of ſhore as large as
the iſland itſelf. The whole water ſeems alive; and is ſeen ſo black
with them to a great diſtance, that the number ſeems inexhauſtible. There
the porpeſs and the ſhark continue their depredations; and the birds devour
what quantities they pleaſe. By theſe enemies the herrings are cooped up
into ſo cloſe a body, that a ſhovel, or any hollow veſſel put into
the water, takes them up without farther trouble.</p>
                  <p>That body which comes upon our coaſts, begins to appear off
the Shetland Iſles in April. Theſe are the forerunners of the grand ſhoal
which deſcends in June; while its arrival is eaſily announced, by the
number of its greedy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, the gannet, the gull, the ſhark and the
porpeſs. When the main body is arrived, its breadth and depth is ſuch as to
alter the very appearance of the ocean. It is divided into diſtinct columns,
of five or ſix miles in length, and three or four broad; while the water
before them curls up, as if forced out of its bed. Sometimes they ſink for
the ſpace of ten or fifteen minutes, then riſe again to the ſurface; and,
in bright weather, reflect a variety of ſplendid colours, like a field
beſpangled with purple, gold and azure. The fiſhermen are ready prepared to
give them a proper recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0823900106:340"/> and, by nets made for the
occaſion, they take ſometimes above two thouſand barrels at a ſingle
draught.</p>
                  <p>From the Shetland Iſles, another body of this great army,
where it divides, goes off to the weſtern coaſts of Ireland, where they
meet with a ſecond neceſſity of dividing. The one takes to the Atlantic,
where it is ſoon loſt in that extenſive ocean; the other paſſes into
the Iriſh ſea, and furniſhes a very conſiderable capture to the
natives.</p>
                  <p>In this manner, the herrings expelled from their native
ſeas, ſeek thoſe bays and ſhores where they can find food, and the
beſt defence againſt their unmerciful purſuers of the deep. In general,
the moſt inhabited ſhores are the places where the larger animals of the
deep are leaſt fond of purſuing; and theſe are choſen by the herring as
an aſylum from greater dangers. Thus, along the coaſts of Norway, the
German ſhores, and the northern ſhores of France, theſe animals are found
punctual in their viſitations. In theſe different places they produce their
young; which, when come to ſome degree of maturity, attend the general
motions. After the deſtruction of ſuch numbers, the quantity that attempts
to return is but ſmall; and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon doubts whether they ever return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0823900106:341"/>Such is the account given of the
migration of theſe fiſhes, by one who, of all others, was beſt acquainted
with their hiſtory; and yet many doubts ariſe, in every part of the
migration. The moſt obvious which has been made is, that though ſuch
numbers periſh in their deſcent from the north, yet, in compariſon to
thoſe that ſurvive the account is trifling. and it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that
of thoſe taken by man, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not one to a million. Their
regularly leaving the ſhore alſo at a ſtated time, would imply that they
are not in theſe viſits under the impulſe of neceſſity. In fact,
there ſeems one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that ſhews theſe animals governed by a
choice with reſpect to the ſhores they pitch upon; and not blindly drove
from one ſhore to another. What I mean is, their fixing upon ſome ſhores
for ſeveral ſeaſons, or indeed, for ſeveral ages together; and, after
having regularly viſited them every year, then capriciouſly forſaking
them, never more to return. The firſt great bank for herrings was along the
ſhores of Norway. Before the year 1584, the number of ſhips from all parts
of Europe that reſorted to that ſhore, exceeded ſome thouſands. The
quantity of herrings that were then aſſembled there, was ſuch, that a man
who ſhould put a ſpear in the water, as Olaus Magnus aſſerts, would
ſee it <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0823900106:342"/> ſtand on end, being prevented from falling.
But ſoon after that period, theſe animals were ſeen to deſert the
Norway ſhores, and took up along the German coaſt, where the Hanſe-towns
drove a very great trade by their capture and ſale; but, for above a century,
the herrings have, in a great meaſure, forſaken them; and their greateſt
colonies are ſeen in the Britiſh channel, and upon the Iriſh ſhores. It
is not eaſy to aſſign a cauſe for this ſeemingly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious
deſertion: whether the number of their finny enemies encreaſing along the
northern coaſts, may have terrified the herring tribe from their former
places of reſort; or, whether the quantity of food being greater in the
Britiſh channel, may not allure them thither, is not eaſy to determine!</p>
                  <p>The pilchard, which is a fiſh differing little from the
herring, makes the coaſt of Cornwall its place of principal reſort. Their
arrival on that coaſt is ſoon proclaimed by their attendants the birds, and
the larger fiſhes; and the whole country prepare to take the advantage of
this treaſure, providentially thrown before them. The natives ſometimes
encloſe a bay of ſeveral miles extent with their nets called ſaines. To
direct them in their operations, there were ſome years ago (but I believe
they are diſcontinued) ſeveral <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0823900106:343"/> men placed on
eminencies near the ſhore, called <hi>huers,</hi> who, with brooms in their
hands, gave ſignals where the nets were to be extended, and where the
ſhoals of fiſhes lay: this they perceived by the colour of the water, which
aſſumed a tincture from the ſhoals beneath. By theſe means, they
ſometimes take twelve or fifteen hundred barrels of pilchards at a draught;
and they place them in heaps on the ſhore. It often happens, that the
quantity caught exceeds the ſalt or the utenſils for curing them; and then
they are carried off to ſerve for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of manure. This fiſhery
employs nor only great numbers of men at ſea, training them to naval affairs,
but alſo numbers of women and children at land, in ſalting and curing the
fiſh; in making boats, nets, ropes and caſks, for the purpoſes of taking
or fitting them for ſale. The poor are fed with the ſuperfluity of the
capture; the land is manured with the offals: the merchant finds the gain of
commiſſion, and honeſt commerce; the fiſherman a comfortable
ſubſiſtence from his toil. 
<q rend="inline">"Ships," ſays Dr. Borlaſe, "are often
freighted hither with ſalt, and into foreign countries with the fiſh,
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying off at the ſame time a part of our tin. The uſual produce of the
number of hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads exported for ten years, from 1747 to 
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0823900106:344"/> 1756 incluſive, amounted to near thirty thouſand
hogſheads each year: every hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head has amounted, upon an average, to the
price of one pound, thirteen ſhillings and three-pence. Thus the money paid
for pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards exported, has annually amounted to near fifty thouſand
pounds."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence theſe infinite numbers are derived, ſtill remains
obſcure; but it will encreaſe our wonder to be told, that ſo ſmall a
fiſh as the ſtickleback, which is ſeldom above two inches long, and that
one would think could eaſily find ſupport in any water, is yet obliged to
colonize, and leave its native fens in ſearch of new habitations. Once every
ſeventh or eighth year, amazing ſhoals of theſe appear in the river
Welland, near Spalding, and come up the ſtream, forming one great column.
They are ſuppoſed to be multitudes collected in ſome of the fens, till
overcharged with numbers, they are periodically obliged to migrate. An idea may
be had of their numbers, when we are informed, that a man, employed by a farmer
to take them, for the purpoſe of manuring his grounds, has got, for a
conſiderable time, four ſhillings a day, by ſelling them at a halfpenny a
buſhel!</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the amazing propagation of <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0823900106:345"/> fiſhes along our own coaſts and rivers; but their numbers bear
no proportion to the vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities found among the iſlands of the Indian
ocean. The inhabitants of theſe countries are not under the neceſſity
even of providing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for fiſhing; it is but going down to the
ſhore, and there the fiſh are found in great numbers in the plaſhes that
ſtill continue to have water in them. In ſome of theſe places the
quantity is ſo great, that they are leſt in ſhoals, on thoſe ſwamps,
dried up by the ſun, and their putrefaction contributes to render the country
unhealthful.</p>
                  <p>This power of encreaſing in theſe animals, exceeds our
idea, as it would, in a very ſhort time, outſtrip all calculation. A
ſingle her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, if ſuffered to multiply unmoleſted and undiminiſhed
for twenty years, would ſhew a progeny greater in bulk than ten ſuch globes
as that we live upon. But happily the balance of nature is exactly preſerved;
and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is equal to their fecundity. For this reaſon we are
to conſider the porpeſs, the ſhark, or the cod-fiſh, not in the light
of plunderers and rivals, but of benefactors to mankind. Without their
aſſiſtance, the ſea would ſoon become overcharged with the burthen of
its own productions; and that element, which at <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0823900106:346"/>
preſent diſtributes health and plenty to the ſhore, would but load it
with putrefaction.</p>
                  <p>In the propagation of all fiſh ſome degree of warmth
ſeems abſolutely neceſſary, not only to their preſervation, but to
the advancement of their poſterity. Their ſpawn is always depoſited in
thoſe places where the ſun-beams may reach them, either at the bottom of
ſhallow ſhores, or floating on the ſurface in deeper waters. A ſmall
degree of heat anſwers all the purpoſes of incubation, and the animal
iſſues from the egg in its ſtate of perfect formation, never to undergo
any ſucceeding change.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſtill, I have ſome doubts whether moſt fiſh come
from the egg completely formed. We know that in all the frog tribe, and many of
the lizard kind, they are produced from the egg in an imperfect form. The
tadpole, or young frog, with its enormous head and ſlender tail, are well
known; a ſpecies of the lizard alſo, which is excluded from the ſhell
without legs, only acquires them by degrees, and not till after ſome time
does it put off its ſerpent form. It is probable that ſome kinds of fiſh
in like manner ſuffer a change; and though it be too inconſiderable to
ſtrike the fiſherman or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive ſpectator, yet it makes a very
material difference to the naturaliſt, and would perhaps 
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0823900106:347"/> diſarrange his moſt favourite ſyſtems. A
ſlight alteration in the fins or bones that cover the gills would overturn
the whole fabric of the moſt applauded ichthyologiſt; and yet, as I
obſerved, it is moſt probable that theſe minute alterations often take
place.</p>
                  <p>As a proof of this, during the month of July, there appear
near Greenwich innumerable ſhoals of ſmall fiſhes, which are known to the
Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners by the name of White Bait. It is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally agreed that they are
the young of ſome fiſh; they are never ſeen but at this time of the year,
and never found to have any roe, a circumſtance that proves their not being
come to maturity. The quantity is amazing; and the fiſh that produces them in
ſuch numbers muſt be in plenty, though it is not yet known what that fiſh
is, as they correſpond with no other ſpecies whatever. They moſt
reſemble the ſmelt in form; and yet they want a fin, which that animal is
never without. They cannot be the bleak, as they are never found in other
rivers where the bleak breed in great abundance. It is moſt probable,
therefore, that they are the young of ſome animal not yet come to their
perfect form, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to no preſent ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>The time that ſpinous fiſhes continue in the 
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0823900106:348"/> pea is in proportion to the ſize of the kind. It is a
rule that chiefly holds through nature, that the larger the animals are, the
longer they continue before excluſion. This I ſay holds generally through
all nature; though it is not eaſy to aſſign a cauſe for ſo well known
a truth. It may probably be, that as all large bodies take a longer time to
grow hot than ſmall ones, ſo the larger the egg, the longer influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of
vital warmth it requires to reach through all its receſſes, and to unfold
the dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant ſprings that wait to be put into motion.</p>
                  <p>The manner in which the eggs of fiſhes are impregnated is
wholly unknown. All that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly offers is, that in ponds the ſexes are
often ſeen together among the long graſs at the edge of the water; that
there they ſeem to ſtruggle; and that during this time they are in a
ſtate of ſuffering; they grow thin; they loſe their appetite, and their
fleſh becomes flabby; the ſcales of ſome grow rough, and they loſe
their luſtre. On the contrary, when the time of coupling is over, their
appetite returns; they re-aſſume their natural agility, and their ſcales
become brilliant and beautiful.</p>
                  <p>Although the uſual way with ſpinous fiſhes is to produce
by ſpawn; yet there are ſome, ſuch as the cel and the blenny, that are
known to bring forth their young alive. Bowlker, who <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0823900106:349"/> has
written a treatiſe upon fiſhing, ſeems to determine the queſtion
relative to the viviparous production of eels, upon the authority of one or two
credible witneſſes. An eel, opened in the preſence of ſeveral perſons
of credit, was found to have an infinite number of little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, cloſely
wrapped up together in a lump, about the ſize of a nutmeg, which being put
into a baſon of water, ſoon ſeparated, and ſwam about: yet ſtill,
whether theſe may not have been worms generated in the animal's body, remains
a doubt; for there are ſcarce any fiſhes that are not infeſted with worms
in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the growth of fiſhes, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that among carps, particularly the firſt year, they grow to about the ſize
of the leaf of a willow-tree; at two years, they are about four inches long.
They grow but one inch more the third ſeaſon, which is five inches. Thoſe
of four years old are about ſix inches; and ſeven after the fifth. From
that to eight years old they are found to be large in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the
goodneſs of the pond, from eight to twelve inches. With regard to
ſea-fiſh, the fiſhermen aſſure us that a fiſh muſt be ſix years
old before it is fit to be ſerved up to table. They inſtance it in the
growth of a mackarel. <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0823900106:350"/> They aſſure us that thoſe a
year old are as large as one's finger; that thoſe of two years, are about
twice that length; at three and four years, they are that ſmall kind of
mackarel that have neither melts nor rows; and between five and ſix, they are
thoſe full grown fiſh that are ſerved up to our tables. In the ſame
manner, with regard to flat fiſhes, they tell us that the turbot and barble
at one year are about the ſize of a crown piece; the ſecond year as large
as the palm of one's hand; and at the fifth and ſixth year, they are large
enough to be ſerved up to table. Thus it appears that fiſh are a
conſiderable time in coming to their full growth, and that they are a
long-time deſtroyed before it comes to their turn to be deſtroyers<note n="*" place="bottom">

ſix feet long; the back all over enamelled with ſpots of a bluiſh green
and ſilver; the tail and fins of a gold colour; and all have a brilliancy of
tint, that nothing but Nature's pencil can attain to: the eyes are placed on
each ſide of the head, large and beautiful, ſurrounded with circles of
ſhining gold. In the ſeas where they are found, theſe fiſh are always
in motion, and playround ſhips in full ſail, with eaſe and ſecurity:
for ever either purſuing or purſued, they are ſeen continually in a
ſtate of warfare; either defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the ſhark, or
darting after the ſmaller fiſhes. Of all others, the Flying-fiſh moſt
abounds in theſe ſeas; and as it is a ſmall animal, ſeldom growing
above the ſize of a herring, it is chiefly ſought by the dorado. Nature has
furniſhed each reſpectively with the powers of purſuit and evaſion. The
dorado being above ſix feet long, yet not thicker than a ſalmon, and
furniſhed with a full complement of fins, cuts its way through the water with
amazing rapidity: on the other hand, the flying-fiſh is furniſhed with two
pair of fins longer than the body, and theſe alſo moved by a ſtronger
ſet of muſcles than any other. This equality of power ſeems to furniſh
one of the moſt entertaining ſpectacles thoſe ſeas can 
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0823900106:353"/> exhibit. The efforts to ſeize on the one ſide, and
the arts of eſcaping on the other, are perfectly amuſing. The dorado is
ſeen, upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, darting after its prey, which will not leave the
water, while it has the advantage of ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, in the beginning of the
chace. But, like an hunted hare, being tired at laſt, it then has recourſe
to another expedient for ſafety, by flight. The long fins, which began to
grow uſeleſs in the water, are now exerted in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner and
different direction to that in which they were employed in ſwimming: by this
means the timid little animal riſes from the water, and flutters over its
ſurface, for two or three hundred yards, till the muſcles employed in
moving the wings, are enfeebled by that particular manner of exertion. By this
time, however, they have acquired a freſh power of renewing their efforts in
the water, and the animal is capable of proceeding with ſome velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city by
ſwimming: ſtill, however, the active enemy keeps it in view, and drives it
again from the deep; till, at length, the poor little creature is ſeen to
dart to ſhorter diſtances, to flutter with greater effort, and to drop down
at laſt into the mouth of its fierce purſuer. But not the dorado alone, all
animated nature ſeems combined againſt this little fiſh, which 
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0823900106:354"/> ſeems poſſeſſed of double powers, only to be
ſubject to greater dangers. For though it ſhould eſcape from its enemies
of the deep, yet the tropic bird and the albatroſs are for ever upon the wing
to ſeize it. Thus purſued in either element, it ſometimes ſeeks refuge
from a new enemy; and it is not unfrequent for whole ſhoals of them to fall
on ſhip-board, where they furniſh man with an object of uſeleſs
curioſity.</p>
                  <p>The warfare in freſh-water is not carried on with ſuch
deſtructive activity; nor are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that element ſo numerous.
It would ſeem that there is ſomething more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the fecundity of
fiſhes in the ocean, than in an element leſs impregnated with ſalt. It
has been the opinion of ſome philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, that all fiſh are natives of
that great reſervoir; and that only colonies have been ſent up rivers,
either through accident, or the neceſſity of procuring ſubſiſtence.
They have been led to this opinion by the ſuperior fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity of ſea
fiſh, which breed twenty to one; as well as by their ſuperiority in
ſtrength and ſize, over thoſe of the ſame kind found in lakes and
rivers. This is a matter too remotely ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative to be worth purſuing;
but certain it is, that, in freſh water, fiſhes ſeem to abate much of
their courage and rapacity; purſue <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0823900106:355"/> each other with
leſs violence, and ſeem to be leſs powerfully actuated by all their
appetites. The greedineſs with which ſea-fiſh devour the bait is
prodigious, if compared with the manner they take it in freſh water. The
lines of ſuch fiſhermen as go off to ſea, are coarſe, thick and
clumſy, compared to what are uſed by thoſe who fiſh at land. Their
baits are ſeldom more than a piece of a fiſh, or the fleſh of ſome
qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupede, ſtuck on the hook in a bungling manner; and ſcarce any art is
employed to conceal the deception. But it is otherwiſe in freſh water; the
lines muſt often be drawn to an hair-like fineneſs; they muſt be
tinctured of the peculiar colour of the ſtream; the bait muſt be formed
with the niceſt art, and even, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to exceed the perfection of
nature: yet ſtill the fiſhes approach it with diffidence, and often ſwim
round it with diſdain. The cod, on the banks of Newfoundland, the inſtant
the hook, which is only baited with the guts of the animal laſt taken, is
dropped into the water, darts to it at once, and the fiſhermen have but to
pull up as faſt as they throw down. But it is otherwiſe with thoſe who
fiſh in freſh waters, they muſt wait whole hours in fruitleſs
expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and <hi>the patience of a fiſherman</hi> is proverbial among
us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0823900106:356"/>This comparative neglect of food, which
is found in all the tribes of freſh water fiſhes, renders them leſs
turbulent and leſs deſtructive among each other. Of all theſe the pike is
the moſt active and voracious; and our poets, whoſe buſineſs it is to
obſerve the ſurface of nature, have called it the tyrant of the watery
plain. In fact, in proportion to its ſtrength and celerity, the pike does
ſome miſchief; but what are its efforts, compared to thoſe of the
cachalot or the ſhark! they reſemble the petty depredations of a robber,
put in competition with the ravages of a conqueror! However, the pike will
attack every fiſh leſs than itſelf; and it is ſometimes ſeen choaked,
by attempting to ſwallow ſuch as are too large a morſel. It is immaterial
of what ſpecies the animal it purſues appears to be, whether of another or
its own; all are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately devoured; ſo that every fiſh owes its
ſafety to its minuteneſs, its celerity, or its courage: nor does the pike
confine itſelf to feed on fiſh and frogs; it will draw down the water-rat
and the young ducks, as they are ſwimming about. Geſner tells us of a mule
that ſtooped to drink in the water, when a famiſhed pike, that was near,
ſeized it by the noſe, nor was it diſengaged till the beaſt flung it on
ſhore. So great is their rapacity, that <pb n="346" facs="tcp:0823900106:357"/> they will
contend with the otter for his prey, and even endeavour to force it from him.
For this reaſon it is dreaded by all other fiſh; and the ſmall ones
ſhew the ſame uneaſineſs and deteſtation at the preſence of their
tyrant, as the little birds do at the ſight of an hawk or an owl. When the
pike lies aſleep near the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, as is frequently the caſe, the
leſſer fiſh are often obſerved to ſwim around it in vaſt numbers,
with a mixture of caution and terror.</p>
                  <p>The other tribes of freſh water fiſh are much inferior to
this animal in courage and rapacity: they chiefly ſubſiſt upon worms and
inſects, purſuing them at the bottom, or jumping after them to the
ſurface of the water. In winter alſo, their appetite ſeems entirely to
forſake them; at leaſt they continue in ſo torpid a ſtate, that few
baits will tempt them to their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At that ſeaſon, they
forſake the ſhallow waters, and ſeek thoſe deep holes to be found in
every river, where they continue for days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without ever appearing to
move. The cold ſeems to affect them; for at that time they lie cloſe to the
bottom, where the water is moſt warm, and ſeldom venture out except the day
be peculiarly fine, and the ſhallows at the edges of the ſtream become
tepified by the powerful rays of the ſun. Indeed, I have been aſſured,
that <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0823900106:358"/> ſome fiſhes may be rendered ſo torpid by the
cold, in the northern rivers, as to be frozen up, in the great maſſes of
ice, in which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ſeveral months together, ſeemingly without
life or ſenſation, the priſoners of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation, and waiting the
approach of a warmer ſun, to reſtore them at once to life and liberty. Thus
that chearful luminary not only diſtributes health and vegetation to the
productions of the earth, but is ardently ſought even by the gelid
inhabitants of the water.</p>
                  <p>As fiſh are enemies one to another, ſo each ſpecies is
infeſted with worms of different kinds, peculiar to itſelf. The great
fiſh abound with them; and the little ones are not entirely free. Theſe
troubleſome vermin lodge themſelves either in the jaws, and the
inteſtines internally, or near the fins without. When fiſh are healthy and
fat, they are not much annoyed by them; but in winter, when they are lean or
ſickly, they then ſuffer very much.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the reputed longevity of this claſs ſecure them
from their peculiar diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They are not only affected by too much cold,
but there are frequently certain diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the element in which they
reſide, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable to their health and propagation. Some ponds they will
not breed in, however <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0823900106:359"/> artfully diſpoſed for
ſupplying them with freſh recruits of water, as well as proviſion. In
ſome ſeaſons they are found to feel epidemic diſorders, and are ſeen
dead by the water-ſide, without any apparent cauſe: yet ſtill they are
animals of all others the moſt vivacious, and they often live and
ſubſiſt upon ſuch ſubſtances as are poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous to the more
perfect claſſes of animated nature.</p>
                  <p>It is not eaſy to determine whether the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
qualities which many of them are found to poſſeſs, either when they wound
our bodies externally with their ſpines, or when they are unwarily eaten at
our tables, ariſes from this cauſe. That numbers of fiſhes inflict
poiſonous wounds, in the opinion of many, cannot be doubted. The concurrent
teſtimony of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, they think ſufficient to contradict any
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings upon this head, taken from anatomical inſpection. The great
pain that is felt from the ſting given by the back fin of the weever, bears
no proportion to the ſmallneſs of the inſtrument that inflicts the wound.
How the poiſon is preſerved, or how it is conveyed by the animal, it is not
in our power to perceive; but its actual exiſtence has been often atteſted
by painful experience. In this inſtance we muſt decline conjecture,
ſatisfied with hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0823900106:360"/>The fact of their being poiſonous when
eaten, is equally notorious; and the cauſe equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable. My poor
worthy friend Dr. Grainger, who reſided for many years at St.
Chriſtopher's, aſſured me, that of the fiſh caught, of the ſame kind,
at one end of the iſland, ſome were the beſt and moſt wholeſome in
the world; while others taken at a different end, were always dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and
moſt commonly fatal. We have a paper in the Philoſophical Tranſactions,
giving an account of the poiſonous qualities of thoſe found at New
Providence, one of the Bahama iſlands. The author there aſſures us, that
the greateſt part of the fiſh of that dreary coaſt, are all of a deadly
nature: their ſmalleſt effects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring on a terrible pain in the
joints, which, if terminating favourably, leaves the patient without any
appetite for ſeveral days after. It is not thoſe of the moſt deformed
figure, or the moſt frightful to look at, that are alone to be dreaded; all
kinds, at different times, are alike dangerous; and the ſame ſpecies which
has this day ſerved for nouriſhment, is the next, if tried, found to be
fatal!</p>
                  <p>This noxious quality has given riſe to much ſpeculation,
and many conjectures. Some have ſuppoſed it to ariſe from the fiſhes on
theſe ſhores eating of the machinel apple, a deadly <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0823900106:361"/>
vegetable poiſon, that ſometimes grows pendent over the ſea: but the
quantity of thoſe trees, growing in this manner, bears no proportion to the
extenſive infection of the fiſh. Labat has aſcribed it to their eating
the gally fiſh, which is itſelf moſt potently poiſonous; but this only
removes our wonder a little farther back; for it may be aſked, with as juſt
a cauſe for curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, how comes the gally fiſh itſelf to procure its
noxious qualities? Others have aſcribed the poiſon of theſe fiſhes to
their feeding upon coperas beds: but I do not know of any cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mines found
in America. In ſhort, as we cannot deſcribe the alembic by which the
rattle-ſnake diſtils its malignity, nor the proceſs by which the
ſcorpion, that lives among roſes, converts their ſweets to venom, ſo we
cannot diſcover the manner by which fiſhes become thus dangerous; and it is
well for us of Europe that we can thus wonder in ſecurity. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that, with us, if fiſhes, ſuch as carp or tench, acquire any diſagreeable
flavour from the lakes in which they have been bred, this can be removed, by
their being kept ſome time in finer and better water: there they ſoon clear
away all thoſe diſagreeable qualities their fleſh had contracted, and
become as delicate as if they had been always fed in the moſt cleanly 
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0823900106:362"/> manner. But this expedient is with us rather the
precaution of luxury, than the effect of fear; we have nothing to dread from
the noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualities of our fiſh; for all the animals our waters furniſh
are wholeſome.</p>
                  <p>Happy England! where the ſea furniſhes an abundant and
luxurious repaſt, and the freſh waters an innocent and harmleſs
paſtime; where the angler, in chearful ſolitude, ſtrolls by the edge of
the ſtream, and fears neither the coiled ſnake, nor the lurking crocodile;
where he can retire at night, with his few trouts, to borrow the pretty
deſcription of old Walton, to ſome friendly cottage, where the landlady is
good, and the daughter innocent and beautiful; where the room is cleanly, with
lavender in the ſheets, and twenty ballads ſtuck about the wall! There he
can enjoy the company of a talkative bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſportſman, have his trouts
dreſſed for ſupper, tell tales, ſing old tunes, or make a catch! There
he can talk of the wonders of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with learned admiration, or find ſome
harmleſs ſport to content him, and paſs away a little time, without
offence to God, or injury to man!</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of the Diviſion of Shell Fiſh.</head>
                  <p>IN deſcribing the inhabitants of the water, a claſs of
animals occur, that mankind, from the place of their reſidence, have been
content to call fiſh; but that naturaliſts, from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, have
juſtly agreed to be unworthy of the name. Indeed, the affinity many of this
kind bear to the inſect tribe, may very well plead for the hiſtorian who
ranks them rather as inſects. However, the common language of a country
muſt not be ſlightly invaded; the names of things may remain, if the
philoſopher be careful to give preciſion to our ideas of them.</p>
                  <p>There are two claſſes of animals, therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
the water, which commonly receive the name of fiſhes, entirely different from
thoſe we have been deſcribing, and alſo very diſtinct from each other.
Theſe are divided by naturaliſts into Cruſtaceous and Teſtaceous
animals: both, totally unlike fiſhes to appearance, ſeem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the
order of nature; and as thoſe have their bones on the inſide, and their
muſcles hung upon them for the purpoſes of life and motion, theſe, on the
contrary, have all their bony parts on <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0823900106:365"/> the outſide,
and all their muſcles within. Not to talk myſteriouſly—all who have
ſeen a lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or an oyſter, perceive that the ſhell in theſe bears
a ſtrong analogy to the bones of other animals; and that, by theſe
ſhells, the animal is ſuſtained and defended.</p>
                  <p>Cruſtaceous fiſh, ſuch as the crab and the lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
have a ſhell not quite of a ſtony hardneſs, but rather reſembling a
firm cruſt, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure capable of yielding. Teſtaceous
fiſhes, ſuch as the oyſter or cockle, are furniſhed with a ſhell of a
ſtony hardneſs; very brittle, and incapable of yielding. Of the
cruſtaceous kinds are the Lobſter, the Crab, and the Tortoiſe: of the
teſtaceous, that numerous tribe of Oyſters, Muſcles, Cockles, and Sea
Snails, which offer with infinite variety.</p>
                  <p>The cruſtaceous tribe ſeem to hold the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle rank
between fiſhes, properly ſo called, and thoſe ſnail like animals that
receive the name of teſtaceous fiſhes. Their muſcles are ſtrong and
firm, as in the former; their ſhell is ſelf-produced, as among the latter.
They have motion, and hunt for food with great avidity, like the former. They
are incapable of ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, but creep along the bottom, like the latter: in
ſhort, they form the link that unites theſe two claſſes, that ſeem
ſo very oppoſite in their natures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0823900106:366"/>Of teſtaceous fiſhes we will ſpeak
hereafter. As to animals of the cruſtaceous kind, they are very numerous,
their figure offers an hundred varieties: but as to their nature, they are
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly divided into two very diſtinct kinds, differing in their habits
and their conformation. The chief of one kind is the Lobſter; the chief of
the other, the Tortoiſe. Under the Lobſter we rank the Prawn, the Cray
Fiſh, the Shrimp, the Sea Crab, the Land Crab, and all their varieties. Under
the Sea Tortoiſe, the Turtle, the Hawkſbill Turtle, the Land Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe,
and their numerous varieties.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Cruſtaceous Animals of the Lobſter
Kind.</head>
                  <p>HOWEVER different in figure the lobſter and the crab may
ſeem, their manners and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation are nearly the ſame. With all the
voracious appetites of fiſhes, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to lead an inſect life
at the bottom of the water; and though preſſed by continual hunger, they
are often obliged to wait till ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident brings them their prey. Though without
any warmth in their bodies, or even without red blood circulating through their
veins, they are animals wonderfully voracious. Whatever they ſeize upon that
has life, is ſure to periſh, though never ſo well defended: they even
devour each other: and, to encreaſe our ſurprize ſtill more, they may, in
ſome meaſure, be ſaid to eat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as they change their ſhell
and their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach every year, and their old ſtomach is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the
firſt morſel that ſerves to glut the new.</p>
                  <p>The lobſter is an animal of ſo extraordinary a form, that
thoſe who firſt ſee it are apt to miſtake the head for the tail; but it
is ſoon diſcovered that the animal moves with its claws foremoſt; and
that the part which plays <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0823900106:368"/> within itſelf by joints,
like a coat of armour, is the tail. The two great claws are the lobſter's
inſtruments of proviſion and defence; theſe, by opening like a pair of
nippers, have great ſtrength, and take a firm hold; they are uſually
notched, like a ſaw, which ſtill more encreaſes their tenacity. Beſide
theſe powerful inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which may be conſidered as arms, the
lobſter has eight legs, four on each ſide; and theſe, with the tail,
ſerve to give the animal its progreſſive and ſideling motion. Between
the two claws is the animal's head, very ſmall, and furniſhed with eyes
that ſeem like two black horny ſpecks on each ſide; and theſe it has a
power of advancing out of the ſocket, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in at pleaſure. The
mouth, like that of inſects, opens the long way of the body; not
croſſways, as with man, and the higher race of animals. It is furniſhed
with two teeth for the comminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its food; but as theſe are not
ſufficient, it has three more in the ſtomach; one on each ſide, and the
other below. Between the two teeth there is a fleſhy ſubſtance, in the
ſhape of a tongue. The inteſtines conſiſt of one long bowel, which
reaches from the mouth to the vent; but what this animal differs in from all
others, is, that the ſpinal marrow is in the breaſt-bone. It is furniſhed
with two long <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0823900106:369"/> feelers or horns, that iſſue on each
ſide of the head, that ſeem to correct the dimneſs of its ſight, and
apprize the animal of its danger, or of its prey. The tail, or that jointed
inſtrument at the other end, is the grand inſtrument of motion; and with
this it can raiſe itſelf in the water. Under this we uſually ſee lodged
the ſpawn in great abundance; every pea adhering to the next by a very fine
filament, which is ſcarcely perceivable. Every lobſter is an
her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite, and is ſuppoſed to be ſelf-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated! The ovary, or
place where the ſpawn is firſt produced, is backwards, toward the tail,
where a red ſubſtance is always found, and which is nothing but a cluſter
of peas, that are yet too ſmall for excluſion. From this receptacle there
go two canals, that open on each ſide at the jointures of the ſhell, at the
belly; and through theſe paſſages the peas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to be excluded, and
placed under the tail, where the animal preſerves them from danger for ſome
time, until they come to maturity; when, being furniſhed with limbs and
motion, they drop off into the water.</p>
                  <p>When the young lobſters leave the parent, they immediately
ſeek for refuge in the ſmalleſt clefts of rocks, and in ſuch like
crevices at the bottom of the ſea, where the entrance is but ſmall, and the
opening can be eaſily defended. <pb n="361" facs="tcp:0823900106:370"/> There, without
ſeeming to take any food, they grow larger in a few weeks time, from the mere
accidental ſubſtances which the water waſhes to their retreats. By this
time alſo they acquire an hard, firm ſhell, which furniſhes them with
both offenſive and defenſive armour. They then begin to iſſue from
their fortreſſes, and boldly creep along the bottom, in hopes of meeting
with more diminutive plunder. The ſpawn of fiſh, the ſmaller animals of
their own kind, but chiefly the worms that keep at the bottom of the ſea,
ſupply them with plenty. They keep in this manner cloſe among the rocks,
buſily employed in ſcratching up the ſand with their claws for worms, or
ſurprizing ſuch heedleſs animals as fall within their graſp: thus they
have little to apprehend, except from each other; for in them, as among
fiſhes, the large are the moſt formidable of all other enemies to the
ſmall.</p>
                  <p>But this life of abundance and ſecurity is ſoon to have a
moſt dangerous interruption; for the body of the lobſter ſtill continuing
to encreaſe, while its ſhell remains inalterably the ſame, the animal
becomes too large for its habitation, and impriſoned within the cruſt that
has na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally gathered round it, there comes on a neceſſity of getting
free. The young of this <pb n="362" facs="tcp:0823900106:371"/> kind, therefore, that grow
faſter, as I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the fiſhermen, change their ſhell oftener
than the old, who come to their full growth, and who remain in the ſame
ſhell often for two years together. In general, however, all theſe animals
change their ſhell once a year; and this is not only a moſt painful
operation, but alſo ſubjects them to every danger. Their molting ſeaſon
is generally about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſummer; at which time their food is in
plenty, and their ſtrength and vigour in the higheſt perfection. But ſoon
all their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity ceaſes: they are ſeen forſaking the open parts of the
deep, and ſeeking ſome retired ſituation among the rocks, or ſome
outlet where they may remain in ſafety from the attacks of their various
enemies. For ſome days before their change, the animal diſcontinues its
uſual voraciouſneſs; it is no longer ſeen laboriouſly harrowing up
the ſand at the bottom, or fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others of its kind, or hunting its
prey; it lies torpid and motionleſs, as if in anxious expectation of the
approaching change. Juſt before caſting its ſhell, it throws itſelf
upon its back, ſtrikes its claws againſt each other, and every limb ſeems
to tremble; its feelers are agitated, and the whole body is in violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
it then ſwells itſelf in an unuſual manner, <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0823900106:372"/> and at
laſt the ſhell is ſeen beginning to divide at its junctures; particularly
it opens at the junctures of the belly, where, like a pair of jumps, it was
before but ſeemingly united. It alſo ſeems turned inſide out; and its
ſtomach comes away with its ſhell. After this, by the ſame operation, it
diſengages itſelf of the claws, which burſt at the joints; the animal,
with a tremulous motion, caſting them off as a man would kick off a boot that
was too big for him.</p>
                  <p>Thus, in a ſhort time, this wonderful creature finds
itſelf at liberty; but in ſo weak and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled a ſtate, that it
continues for ſeveral hours motionleſs. Indeed, ſo violent and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is the operation, that many of them die under it; and thoſe which ſurvive,
are in ſuch a weakly ſtate for ſome time, that they neither take food,
nor venture from their retreats. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after this change, they have not
only the ſoftneſs, but the timidity of a worm. Every animal of the deep is
then a powerful enemy, which they can neither eſcape nor oppoſe; and this,
in fact, is the time when the dog-fiſh, the cod, and the ray, devour them by
hundreds. But this ſtate of defenceleſs imbecillity continues for a very
ſhort time: the animal, in leſs than two days, is ſeen to have the ſkin
that covered <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0823900106:373"/> its body grown almoſt as hard as before;
its appetite is ſeen to encreaſe; and, ſtrange to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! the firſt
object that tempts its gluttony, is its own ſtomach, which it ſo lately was
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from. This it devours with great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſome time
after eats even its former ſhell. In about forty-eight hours, in proportion
to the animal's health and ſtrength, the new ſhell is perfectly formed, and
as hard as that which was but juſt thrown aſide.</p>
                  <p>To contribute to the ſpeedy growth of the ſhell, it is
ſuppoſed by ſome, that the lobſter is ſupplied with a very
extraordinary concretion within its body, that is converted into the ſhelly
ſubſtance. It is a chalky ſubſtance, found in the lower part of the
ſtomach of all lobſters, improperly called crab's eyes, and ſold under
that title in the ſhops. About the time the lobſter quits its ſhell, the
teeth in its ſtomach break theſe ſtones to pieces, and the fluids
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein diſſolve them. This fluid, which ſtill remains in the
new ſtomach, is thought to be replete with a petrifying quality, proper for
forming a new ſhell: however, the concreting power that firſt formed
theſe, ſhews a ſufficient power in the animal to produce alſo the
ſhell; and it is going but a ſhort way in the cauſes of things, when we
attempt to explain one wonder by another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0823900106:374"/>When the lobſter is compleatly
equipped in its new ſhell, it then appears how much it has grown in the
ſpace of a very few days; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the old ſhell being compared
with thoſe of the new, it will be found that the creature is encreaſed
above a third in its ſize; and, like a boy that has outgrown his cloaths, it
ſeems wonderful how the deſerted ſhell was able to contain ſo great an
animal as entirely fills up the new.</p>
                  <p>The creature thus furniſhed, not only with a complete
covering, but alſo a greater ſhare of ſtrength and courage, ventures more
boldly among the animals at bottom; and not a week paſſes that in its
combats it does not ſuffer ſome mutilation. A joint, or even a whole claw,
is ſometimes ſnapped off in theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters. At certain ſeaſons of
the year theſe animals never meet each other without an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. In
theſe, to come off with the loſs of a leg, or even a claw, is conſidered
as no great calamity; the victor carries off the ſpoil to feaſt upon at his
leiſure, while the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires from the defeat to wait for a thorough
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. This repair is not long in procuring. From the place where the joint
of the claw was cut away, is ſeen in a moſt ſurprizing manner to burgeon
out the beginning of a new claw. <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0823900106:375"/> This, if obſerved, at
firſt, is ſmall and tender, but grows, in the ſpace of three weeks, to be
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as large and as powerful as the old one. I ſay almoſt as large,
for it never arrives to the full ſize; and this is the reaſon we generally
find the claws of the lobſters of unequal magnitude.</p>
                  <p>After what has been thus deſcribed, let us pauſe a little,
to reflect on the wonders this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary creature offers to our
imagination! An animal without bones on the inſide, yet furniſhed with a
ſtomach capable of digeſting the hardeſt ſubſtances, the ſhells of
muſcles, of oyſters, and even its own; an animal gaining a new ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and a new ſhell at ſtated intervals! Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the inſtruments of
generation double in both ſexes; and yet with an apparent inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of
uniting! Without red blood circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating through the body, and yet apparently
vigorous and active! But moſt ſtrange of all, an animal endowed with a
vital principle that furniſhes out ſuch limbs as have been cut away; and
keeps continually combating it, though in conſtant repair to renew its
engagements!—Theſe are but a ſmall part of the wonders of the deep,
where Nature ſports without a ſpectator!</p>
                  <p>Of this extraordinary yet well known animal there are many
varieties, with ſome differences <pb facs="tcp:0823900106:376"/>

                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0823900106:377"/> in the claws, but little in
the habits or confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. It is found above three feet long; and if we may
admit the ſhrimp and the prawn into the claſs, though unfurniſhed with
claws, it is ſeen not above an inch. Theſe all live in the water, and can
bear its abſence for but a few hours. The ſhell is black when taken out of
the water, but turns red by boiling. The moſt common way of taking the
lobſter is in a baſket, or pot, as the fiſhermen call it, made of
wicker-work, in which they put the bait, and then throw it to the bottom of the
ſea, in ſix or ten fathom water. The lobſters creep into this for the
ſake of the bait, but are not able to get out again. The river craw-fiſh
differs little from the lobſter, but that the one will live only in freſh
water, and the other will thrive only in the ſea.</p>
                  <p>The crab is an animal found equally in freſh and ſalt
water; as well upon land as in the ocean. In ſhape it differs very much from
the lobſter, but entirely reſembles it in habits and conformation. The tail
in this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is not ſo apparent as in the former, being that broad flap
that ſeems to cover a part of the belly, and when lifted diſcovers the peas
or ſpawn, ſituated there in great abundance. It reſembles the lobſter
in the number of its claws, which are two; and its legs, which are eight, 
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0823900106:378"/> four on either ſide. Like the lobſter, it is a bold
voracious animal; and ſuch an enmity do crabs bear each other, that thoſe
who carry them for ſale to market, often tie their claws with ſtrings to
prevent their fighting and maiming themſelves by the way. In ſhort, it
reſembles the lobſter in every thing but the amazing bulk of its body
compared to the ſize of its head, and the length of its inteſtines, which
have many convolutions.</p>
                  <p>As the crab, however, is found upon land as well as in the
water, the peculiarity of its ſituation produces a difference in its
habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, which it is proper to deſcribe. The Land Crab is found in ſome
of the warmer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Europe, and in great abundance in all the tropical
cimates in Africa and America. They are of various kinds, and endued with
various properties; ſome being healthful, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, and nouriſhing food;
others, poiſonous or malignant to the laſt degree; ſome are not above
half an inch broad, others are found a foot over; ſome are of a dirty brown,
and others beautifully mottled. That animal called the Violet Crab of the
Caribbee Iſlands, is the moſt noted both for its ſhape, the delicacy of
its fleſh, and the ſingularity of its manners.</p>
                  <p>The violet crab ſomewhat reſembles two hands cut through
the middle and joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <pb n="369" facs="tcp:0823900106:379"/> for each ſide looks
like four fingers, and the two nippers or claws reſemble the thumbs. All the
reſt of the body is covered with a ſhell as large as a man's hand and
bunched in the middle, on the fore-part of which there are two long eyes of the
ſize of a grain of barley, as tranſparent as chryſtal and as hard as
horn. A little below theſe is the mouth, covered with a ſort of barbs,
under which there are two broad ſharp teeth as white as ſnow. They are not
placed, as in other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, croſs-ways, but in the oppoſite direction,
not much unlike the blades of a pair of ſciſſars. With theſe teeth they
can eaſily cut leaves, fruits, and rotten wood, which is their uſual food.
But their principal inſtrument for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſeizing their food is their
nippers, which catch ſuch an hold, that the animal loſes the limb ſooner
than its graſp, and is often ſeen ſcampering off, having left its claw
ſtill holding faſt upon the enemy. The faithful claw ſeems to perform its
duty, and keeps for above a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute faſtened upon the finger while the crab
is making off<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note>.
In fact it loſes no great matter by leaving a leg or an arm, for they ſoon
grow again, and the animal is found as perfect as before.</p>
                  <p>This, however, is the leaſt ſurprizing part of 
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0823900106:380"/> this creature's hiſtory: and what I am going to
relate, were it not as well known and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently confirmed as any other
circumſtance in natural hiſtory, it might well ſtagger our belief.
Theſe animals live not only in a kind of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſociety in their retreats
in the mountains, but regularly once a year march down to the ſea-ſide in a
body of ſome millions at a time. As they multiply in great numbers, they
chuſe the months of April or May to begin their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; and then ſally
out by thouſands from the ſtumps of hollow trees, from the clefts of rocks,
and from the holes which they dig for themſelves under the ſurface of the
earth. At that time the whole ground is covered with this band of adventurers;
there is no ſetting down one's foot without treading upon them<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Labat. Voyage aux Iſle Francoiſe, vol. ii. p.
221.</bibl>
                     </note>. The ſea is their place of deſtination, and to that they
direct their march with right-lined preciſion. No geometrician could ſend
them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined ſtation by a ſhorter courſe; they neither turn
to the right or left, whatever obſtacles intervene; and even if they meet
with a houſe, they will attempt to ſcale the walls to keep the unbroken
tenor of their way. But though this be the general order of their route, they
upon other occaſions are compelled to conform to <pb n="371" facs="tcp:0823900106:381"/> the
face of the country; and if it be interſected by rivers, they are then ſeen
to wind along the courſe of the ſtream. The proceſſion ſets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from the mountains with the regularity of an army under the guidance of an
experienced commander. They are commonly divided into three battalions; of
which, the firſt conſiſts of the ſtrongeſt and boldeſt males, that,
like pioneers, march forward to clear the route and face the greateſt
dangers. Theſe are often obliged to halt for want of rain, and go into the
moſt convenient encampment till the weather changes. The main body of the
army is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of females, which never leave the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains till the rain
is ſet in for ſome time, and then deſcend in regular battalia, being
formed into columns of fifty paces broad and three miles deep, and ſo cloſe
that they almoſt cover the ground. Three or four days after this the
rear-guard follows; a ſtraggling undiſciplined tribe, conſiſting of
males and females, but neither ſo robuſt nor ſo numerous as the former.
The night is their chief time of proceeding; but if it rains by day, they do
not fail to profit by the occaſion; and they continue to move forward in
their ſlow uniform manner. When the ſun ſhines and is hot upon the
ſurface of the ground, they then make an univerſal halt, and 
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0823900106:382"/> wait till the cool of the evening. When they are
terrified, they march back in a confuſed diſorderly manner, holding up
their nippers, with which they ſometimes tear off a piece of the ſkin, and
then leave the weapon where they inflicted the wound. They even try to
intimidate their enemies; for they often clatter their nippers together, as if
it were to threaten thoſe that come to diſturb them. But though they thus
ſtrive to be formidable to man, they are much more ſo to each other; for
they are poſſeſſed of one moſt unſocial property, which is, that if
any of them by accident is maimed in ſuch a manner as to be incapable of
proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the reſt fall upon and devour it on the ſpot, and then
purſue their journey.</p>
                  <p>When after a fatiguing march and eſcaping a thouſand
dangers, for they are ſometimes three months in getting to the ſhore, they
have arrived at their deſtined port, they prepare to caſt their ſpawn.
The peas are as yet within their bodies, and not excluded, as is uſual in
animals of this kind, under the tail; for the creature waits for the benefit of
the ſea-water to help the delivery. For this purpoſe, the crab has no
ſooner reached the ſhore, than it eagerly goes to the edge of the water,
and lets the waves waſh over its body two or three <pb n="373" facs="tcp:0823900106:383"/>
times. This ſeems only a preparation for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſpawn to maturity;
for without farther delay they withdraw to ſeek a lodging upon land: in the
mean time, the ſpawn grows larger, is excluded out of the body, and ſticks
to the barbs under the flap, or more properly the tail. This bunch is ſeen as
big as an hen's egg, and exactly reſembling the rowes of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. In this
ſtate of pregnancy, they once more ſeek the ſhore for the laſt time,
and ſhaking off their ſpawn into the water, leave accident to bring it to
maturity. At this time whole ſhoals of hungry fiſh are at the ſhore in
expectation of this annual ſupply; the ſea to a great diſtance ſeems
black with them; and about two thirds of the crabs eggs are immediately
devoured by theſe rapacious invaders. The eggs that eſcape are hatched
under the ſand; and ſoon after millions at a time of theſe little crabs
are ſeen quitting the ſhore, and ſlowly travelling up to the
mountains.</p>
                  <p>The old ones, however, are not ſo active to return; they
have become ſo feeble and lean, that they can hardly creep along, and the
fleſh at that time changes its colour. The moſt of them, therefore, are
obliged to continue in the flat parts of the country till they recover, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
holes in the earth, which they cover at the <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0823900106:384"/> mouth with
leaves and dirt ſo that no air may enter. There they throw off their old
ſhells, which they leave as it were quite whole, the place where they opened
on the belly being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen. At that time they are quite naked, and almoſt
without motion for ſix days together, when they become ſo fat as to be
delicious food. They have then under their ſtomachs four large white
ſtones, which gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in proportion as the ſhell hardens, and
when they come to perfection are not to be found. It is at that time that the
animal is ſeen ſlowly making its way back; and all this is moſt commonly
performed in the ſpace of ſix weeks.</p>
                  <p>This animal when poſſeſſed of its retreats in the
mountains is impregnable; for only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon vegetables, it
ſeldom ventures out; and its habitation being in the moſt inacceſſible
places, it remains for a great part of the ſeaſon in perfect ſecurity. It
is only when impelled by the deſire of bringing forth its young, and when
compelled to deſcend into the flat country, that it is taken. At that time
the natives wait for its deſcent in eager expectation, and deſtroy
thouſands; but diſregarding the bodies, they only ſeek for that ſmall
ſpawn which lies on each ſide of the ſtomach within the ſhell, of about
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0823900106:385"/> the thickneſs of a man's thumb. They are much more
valuable upon their return after they have caſt their ſhell; for being
covered with a ſkin reſembling ſoft parchment, almoſt every part except
the ſtomach may be eaten. They are taken in their holes by feeling for them
in the ground with an inſtrument: they are ſought after by night, when on
their journey, with flambeaux. The inſtant the animal perceives itſelf
attacked, it throws itſelf on its back, and with its claws pinches moſt
terribly whatever it happens to faſten on. But the dextrous crab-catcher
takes them by the hinder legs in ſuch a manner, that its nippers cannot touch
him, and thus he throws it into his bag. Sometimes alſo they are caught when
they take refuge at the bottom of holes, in rocks by the ſea-ſide, by
clapping a ſtick at the mouth of the hole, which prevents their getting out;
and then ſoon after the tide coming, enters the hole, and the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is
found upon its retiring drowned in its retreat.</p>
                  <p>Theſe crabs are of conſiderable advantage to the natives;
and the ſlaves very often feed entirely upon them. In Jamaica, where they are
found in great plenty, they are conſidered as one of the greateſt
delicacies of the place. Yet ſtill, the eating of them is attended with 
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0823900106:386"/> ſome danger; for even of this kind many are found
poiſonous, being fed, as it is thought, upon the makinel apple; and whenever
they are found under that noxious plant, they are always rejected with caution.
It is thus with almoſt all the productions of thoſe luxurious climates;
however tempting they may be to the appetite, they but too often are found
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive; and ſcarce a delicacy among them that does not carry its own
alloy.</p>
                  <p>The deſcent of theſe creatures for ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
purpoſes deſerves our admiration; but there is an animal of the lobſter
kind that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually deſcends from its mountains in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and for
purpoſes ſtill more important and various. Its deſcent is not only to
produce an offspring, but to provide itſelf a covering; not only to ſecure
a family, but to furniſh an houſe. The animal I mean is the ſoldier-crab,
which has ſome ſimilitude to the lobſter, if diveſted of its ſhell.
It is uſually about four inches long, has no ſhell behind, but is covered
down to the tail with a rough ſkin, terminating in a point. It is however
armed with ſtrong hard nippers before, like the lobſter; and one of them is
as thick as a man's thumb, and pinches moſt powerfully. It is, as I ſaid,
without a ſhell to any part except its nippers; but what 
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0823900106:387"/> Nature has denied this animal it takes care to ſupply
by art; and taking poſſeſſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted ſhell of ſome
other animal, it reſides in it, till, by growing too large for its
habitation, it is under a neceſſity of change. It is a native of the
Weſt-India Iſlands; and, like the former, it is ſeen every year
deſcending from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the ſea-ſhore, to depoſit its
ſpawn, and to provide itſelf with a new ſhell. This is a moſt
buſtling time with it, having ſo many things to do; and, in fact, very
buſy it appears. It is very probable that its firſt care is to provide for
its offspring before it attends to its own wants; and it is thought, from the
number of little ſhells which it is ſeen examining, that it depoſits its
ſpawn in them, which thus is placed in perfect ſecurity till the time of
excluſion.</p>
                  <p>However this be, the ſoldier is in the end by no means
unmindful of itſelf. It is ſtill ſeen in its old ſhell, which it
appears to have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably outgrown; for a part of the naked body is
ſeen at the mouth of it, which the habitation is too ſmall to hide. A
ſhell, therefore, is to be found large enough to cover the whole body; and
yet not ſo large as to be unmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unwieldy. To anſwer both
theſe ends is no eaſy matter, nor the attainment of a ſlight 
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0823900106:388"/> enquiry. The little ſoldier is ſeen buſily
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rading the ſhore along that line of pebbles and ſhells that is formed by
the extremeſt wave; ſtill, however, dragging its old incommodious
habitation at its tail, unwilling to part with one ſhell, even though a
troubleſome appendage, till it can find another more convenient. It is ſeen
ſtopping at one ſhell, turning it and paſſing it by, going on to
another, contemplating that for a while, and then ſlipping its tail from its
old habitation, to try on the new. This alſo is found to be inconvenient; and
it quickly returns to its old ſhell again. In this manner it frequently
changes, till at laſt it finds one light, roomy and commodious; to this it
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres, though the ſhell be ſometimes ſo large as to hide the body of
the animal, claws and all<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Pere du
Teſtre.</bibl>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is not till after many trials, but many combats alſo,
that the ſoldier is thus completely equipped; for there is often a conteſt
between two of them for ſome well looking favourite ſhell for which they
are rivals. They both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take poſſeſſion; they ſtrike with
their claws; they bite each other, till the weakeſt is obliged to yield, by
giving up the object of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. It is then that the victor immediately
takes <pb n="379" facs="tcp:0823900106:389"/> poſſeſſion, and parades it in his new
conqueſt three or four times back and forward upon the ſtrand before his
envious antagoniſt.</p>
                  <p>When this animal is taken, it ſends forth a feeble cry,
endeavouring to ſeize the enemy with its nippers; which if it faſtens upon
it will ſooner die than quit the graſp. The wound is very painful, and not
eaſily cured. For this reaſon, and as it is not much eſteemed for its
fleſh, it is generally permitted to return to its old retreat to the
mountains in ſafety. There it continues till the neceſſity of changing
once more, and the deſire of producing an offspring, expoſe it to freſh
dangers the year enſuing.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the Tortoiſe and its Kinds.</head>
                  <p>HAVING deſcribed the lobſter and the crab as animals in
ſome meaſure approaching to the inſect tribes, it will appear like
injuſtice to place the Tortoiſe among the number, that, from its
ſtrength, its docility, the warm red blood that is circulating in its veins,
deſerves to be ranked even above the fiſhes. But as this animal is covered,
like the lobſter, with a ſhell, as it is of an amphibious nature, and
brings forth its young from the egg without hatching, we muſt be content to
degrade it among animals that in every reſpect it infinitely
ſurpaſſes.</p>
                  <p>Tortoiſes are uſually divided into thoſe that live upon
land, and thoſe that ſubſiſt in the water; and uſe has made a
diſtinction even in the name; the one being called Tortoiſes, the other
Turtles. However, Seba has proved that all tortoiſes are amphibious; that the
land tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe will live in the water; and that the ſea turtle can be fed
upon land. A land tortoiſe was brought to him that was caught in one of the
canals of Amſterdam, which he kept for half a year in his houſe, where it
lived very well <pb n="381" facs="tcp:0823900106:391"/> contented in both elements. When in the
water it remained with its head above the ſurface; when placed in the ſun,
it ſeemed delighted with its beams, and continued immovable while it felt
their warmth. The difference, therefore, in theſe animals, ariſes rather
from their habits than their conformation; and, upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there will
be leſs variety found between them than between birds that live upon land,
and thoſe that ſwim upon the water.</p>
                  <p>Yet, though Nature ſeems to have made but few diſtinctions
among theſe animals, as to their conformation, yet, in their habits, they are
very diſſimilar; as theſe reſult from the different qualities of their
food, and the different ſorts of enemies they have to avoid or encounter. I
will therefore exhibit their figure and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under one common
deſcription, by which their ſlight differences will be more obvious; and
then I will give a ſeparate hiſtory of the manners of each, as
naturaliſts and travellers have taught us.</p>
                  <p>All tortoiſes, in their external form, pretty much
reſemble each other; their outward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering being compoſed of two great
ſhells, the one laid upon the other, and only touching at the edges: however,
when we come to look cloſer, we ſhall find that the upper ſhell is
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <pb n="382" facs="tcp:0823900106:392"/> of no leſs than thirteen pieces, which are
laid flat upon the ribs, like the tiles of an houſe, by which the ſhell is
kept arched and ſupported. The ſhells both above and below that, which
ſeem, to an inattentive obſerver, to make each but one piece, are bound
together at the edges by very ſtrong and hard ligaments, yet with ſome
ſmall ſhare of motion. There are two holes at either edge of this vaulted
body; one for a very ſmall head, ſhoulders and arms, to peep through; the
other at the oppoſite edge, for the feet and the tail. Theſe ſhells the
animal is never diſengaged from; and they ſerve for its defence againſt
every creature but man.</p>
                  <p>The tortoiſe has but a ſmall head, with no teeth; having
only two bony ridges in the place, ſerrated and hard. Theſe ſerve to
gather and grind its food; and ſuch is the amazing ſtrength of the jaws,
that it is impoſſible to open them where they once have faſtened. Even
when the head is cut off, the jaws ſtill keep their hold; and the muſcles,
in death, preſerve a tenacious rigidity. Indeed, the animal is
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of equal ſtrength in all other parts of its body: the
legs, though ſhort, are inconceivably ſtrong; and torpid as the tortoiſe
may appear, it has been known to carry five men ſtanding 
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0823900106:393"/> upon its back, with apparent eaſe and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Its
manner of going forward is by mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its legs one after the other; and the
claws with which the toes are furniſhed, ſink into the ground like the
nails of an iron ſhod wheel, and thus aſſiſt its progreſſion.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to its internal parts, not to enter into minute
anatomical diſquiſitions, it may not be improper to obſerve, that the
blood circulates in this animal as in ſome cartilaginous fiſhes, and
ſomething in the manner of a child in the womb. The greateſt quantity of
the blood paſſes directly from the vena cava into the left ventricle of the
heart, which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with the right ventricle by an opening; while the
auricles only receive what the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles ſeem incapable of admitting. Thus
the blood is driven by a very ſhort paſſage through the circulation; and
the lungs ſeem to lend only occaſional aſſiſtance. From this
conformation the animal can ſubſiſt for ſome time, without uſing the
lungs or breathing; at leaſt, the lungs are not ſo neceſſary an
inſtrument for driving on the circulation as with us.</p>
                  <p>Such is the general ſtructure of this animal, whether found
to live by land or water. With regard to the differences of theſe animals,
the <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0823900106:394"/> land tortoiſe, from its habits of making uſe of
its feet in walking, is much more nimble upon land than the ſea turtle: the
land tortoiſe, if thrown upon its back, by rocking and balancing its body,
like a child rocking in a cradle, at laſt turns itſelf upon its face again;
but the turtle, when once turned, continues without being able to move from the
ſpot. In comparing the feet alſo of theſe animals, the nails upon the
toes of one that has been long uſed to ſcratch for ſubſiſtence upon
land, are blunt and worn; while thoſe that have only been employed in
ſwimming, are ſharp and long, and have more the ſimilitude of fins. The
brain of the land tortoiſe is but ſmall; and yet it is three times as large
as that of the turtle. There is a difference alſo in the ſhape of their
eggs, and in the paſſage by which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; for, in the land
tortoiſe, the paſſage is ſo narrow, that the egg conforms to the
ſhape of the aperture, and though round when in the body, yet becomes much
more oblong than thoſe of fowls, upon being excluded; otherwiſe they would
never be able to paſs through the bony canal by which they are protruded: on
the contrary, the paſſage is wider in the turtle, and therefore its eggs
are round. Theſe are the moſt ſtriking diſtinctions; but that which is 
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0823900106:395"/> moſt known is their ſize; the land tortoiſe often
not exceeding three feet long, by two feet broad; the ſea turtle being
ſometimes from five to ſeven feet long. The ſize, however, is but a
fallacious diſtinction; ſince land tortoiſes, in ſome parts of India,
grow to a very great magnitude; though probably not, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients affirm,
big enough for a ſingle ſhell to ſerve for the covering of an
houſe.</p>
                  <p>But if the different kinds of tortoiſes are not
ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed by their figure, they are very obviouſly
diſtinguiſhable by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of living. The land tortoiſe lives in
holes dug in the mountains, or near marſhy lakes; the ſea turtle in
cavities of rocks, and extenſive paſtures at the bottom of the ſea. The
tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe makes uſe of its feet to walk with, and burrow in the ground; the
turtle chiefly uſes its feet in ſwimming, or creeping at bottom.</p>
                  <p>The land tortoiſe is generally found, as was obſerved
above, from one foot to five feet long, from the end of the ſnout to the end
of the tail; and from five inches to a foot and an half acroſs the back. It
has a ſmall head, ſomewhat reſembling that of a ſerpent; an eye without
the upper lid; the under eye-lid ſerving to cover and keep that organ in
ſafety. It has a ſtrong, ſcaly tail, like the lizard. Its head the animal
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0823900106:396"/> can put out and hide at pleaſure, under the great
penthouſe of its ſhell: there it can remain ſecure from all attacks;
there, defended on every ſide, it can fatigue the patience of the moſt
formidable animal of the foreſt, that makes uſe only of natural ſtrength
to deſtroy it. As the tortoiſe lives wholly upon vegetable food, it never
ſeeks the encounter; yet, if any of the ſmaller ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals attempt to invade
its repoſe, they are ſure to ſuffer. The tortoiſe, impregnably
defended, is furniſhed with ſuch a ſtrength of jaw, that, though armed
only with bony plates inſtead of teeth, wherever it faſtens, it infallibly
keeps its hold, until it has taken out the piece.</p>
                  <p>Though peaceable in itſelf, it is formed for war in another
reſpect, for it ſeems almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with immortality. Nothing can kill
it; the depriving it of one of its members, is but a ſlight injury; it will
live, though deprived of the brain; it will live, though deprived of its head.
Redi informs us that, in making ſome experiments upon vital motion, he, in
the beginning of the month of November, took a land tortoiſe, made a large
opening in its ſkull, and drew out all the brain, waſhed the cavity, ſo
as not to leave the ſmalleſt part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and then, leaving the hole
open, ſet <pb n="387" facs="tcp:0823900106:397"/> the animal at liberty. Notwithſtanding
this the tortoiſe marched away without ſeeming to have received the
ſmalleſt injury; only it ſhut the eyes, and never opened them afterwards.
Soon after the hole in the ſkull was ſeen to cloſe; and, in three days,
there was a complete ſkin covering the wound. In this manner the animal
lived, without a brain, for ſix months; walking about unconcernedly, and
moving its limbs as before. But the Italian philoſopher, not ſatisfied with
this experiment, carried it ſtill farther; for he cut off the head, and the
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal lived twenty-three days after its ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the body. The head
alſo continued to rattle the jaws, like a pair of caſtanets, for above a
quarter of an hour.</p>
                  <p>Nor are theſe animals leſs long lived than difficult in
deſtroying. Tortoiſes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known to exceed eighty years old; and
there was one kept in the Archbiſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury's garden, at Lambeth,
that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered above an hundred and twenty. It was at laſt killed by
the ſeverity of a froſt, from which it had not ſufficiently defended
itſelf in its winter retreat, which was a heap of ſand, at the bottom of
the garden.</p>
                  <p>The uſual food of the land tortoiſe ſeems not ſo
nouriſhing as to ſupply this extraordinary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <pb n="388" facs="tcp:0823900106:398"/> of vitality. It lives upon vegetables in its retreats in the
mountains or the plain; and ſeldom makes its prey of ſnails or worms, but
when other food is not found in grateful plenty. It is fond alſo of fruits;
and when the foreſt affords them, is generally found not far from where they
grow. As it can move but ſlowly, it is not very delicate in the choice of its
food; ſo that it uſually fills itſelf with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever offers. Thoſe that
are kept in a domeſtic ſtate, will eat any thing; leaves, fruits, corn
bran, or graſs.</p>
                  <p>From the ſmallneſs of its brain, and the ſlowneſs of
its motion, it obviouſly appears to be a torpid, heavy animal, requiring
reſt and ſleep; and, in fact, it retires to ſome cavern to ſleep for
the winter. I already obſerved that its blood circulated through the heart by
a ſhort paſſage; and that it did not, as anatomiſts expreſs it, go
through the great circulation. With us and quadrupes the blood goes from the
veins to the heart; from the heart it is ſent to be ſpread over the lungs;
from the lungs it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the heart again; and from thence it goes to the
arteries, to be diſtributed through the whole body. But its paſſage in
the tortoiſe is much ſhorter; for, from the veins it goes to the heart;
then leaving the lungs entirely out of its courſe, it takes a ſhort cut, if
I may ſo <pb n="389" facs="tcp:0823900106:399"/> ſay, into the beginning of the arteries,
which ſend it round the animal frame. From hence we ſee the lungs are left
out of the circulation; and conſequently, the animal is capable of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to live without continuing to breathe. In this it reſembles the
bat, the ſerpent, the mole, and the lizard; like them it takes up its dark
reſidence for the winter; and, at that time, when its food is no longer in
plenty, it happily becomes inſenſible to the want. Nor is it unmindful to
prepare its retreat, and make it as convenient as poſſible; it is
ſometimes bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried two or three feet in the ground, with its hole furniſhed
with moſs, graſs, and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as well to keep the retreat
warm, as to ſerve for food, in caſe it ſhould prematurely wake from its
ſtate of ſtupefaction. But it muſt not be ſuppoſed that, while it is
thus at reſt, it totally diſcontinues to breathe; on the contrary, an
animal of this kind, if put into a cloſe veſſel, without air, will ſoon
be ſtifled; though not ſo readily as in a ſtate of vigour and
activity.</p>
                  <p>From this dormant ſtate the tortoiſe is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the
genial return of ſpring; and is thought not to be much waſted by its long
confinement. To animals that live an hundred and fifty years, a ſleep of
ſix months is but as <pb n="390" facs="tcp:0823900106:400"/> the nap of a night. All the
actions of theſe long lived creatures ſeem formed upon a ſcale
anſwering the length of their exiſtence: their ſlumbers are for a
ſeaſon; their motions are ſlow, and require time in every action: even
the act of procreation, which among other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals is performed in a very few
minutes, is with them the buſineſs of days. About a month after their
enlargement from a torpid ſtate, they prepare to tranſmit their
poſterity; and both continue joined, for near a month, together. The eggs of
the female are contained in the ovary, above the bladder, which, is extremely
large; and theſe are, before their excluſion, round and naked, with ſpots
of red: after they are laid, however, they aſſume another form, being
ſmaller and longer than thoſe of a hen. This alteration in the figure of
the eggs moſt probably proceeds from the narrowneſs of the bony paſſage
through which they are excluded. Swammerdam, who compared the ſize of the
eggs taken out of this animal's body with the diameter of the paſſage
through which they were excluded, was of opinion that the bones themſelves
ſeparated from each other, and cloſed again; but, in my opinion, it is more
probable to ſuppoſe, that the eggs, and not the bones, alter their form.
Certain it is, that they are round in the body, and that they are oval upon
being protruded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:0823900106:401"/>The eggs of all the tortoiſe kind,
like thoſe of birds, are furniſhed with a yolk and a white; but the ſhell
is different, being ſomewhat like thoſe ſoft eggs that hens exclude
before their time: however, this ſhell is much thicker and ſtronger, and is
a longer time in coming to maturity in the womb. The land tortoiſe lays but a
few in number, if compared to the ſea turtle, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſits from an hundred
and fifty to two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in a ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>The amount of the land tortoiſe's eggs, I have not been able
to learn; but, from the ſcarceneſs of the animal, I am apt to think they
cannot be very numerous. When it prepares to lay, the female ſcratches a
ſlight depreſſion in the earth, generally in a warm ſituation, where
the beams of the ſun have their full effect: there depoſiting her eggs, and
covering them with graſs and leaves, ſhe forſakes them, to be hatched by
the heat of the ſeaſon. The young tortoiſes are generally excluded in
about twenty-ſix days; but, as the heat of the weather aſſiſts, or its
coldneſs retards incubation, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happens that there is a
difference of two or three days. The little animals no ſooner leave the egg
than they ſeek for their proviſion, entirely ſelf-taught; and their
ſhell, with which they are covered from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <pb n="392" facs="tcp:0823900106:402"/> expands and grows larger with age; As it is compoſed of a variety
of pieces, they are all capable of extenſion at their futures, and the
ſhell admits of encreaſe in every direction. It is otherwiſe with thoſe
animals, like the lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, whoſe ſhell is compoſed all of one piece,
that admits of no encreaſe; which, when the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is too big for the
habitation, muſt burſt the ſhell, and get another. But the covering of
the tortoiſe grows larger in proportion as the internal parts expand; in
ſome meaſure reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the growth of the human ſkull, which is
compoſed of a number of bones, encreaſing in ſize in proportion to the
quantity of the brain. All tortoiſes, therefore, as they never change their
ſhell, muſt have it formed in pieces; and though, in ſome that have been
deſcribed by painters or hiſtorians, theſe marks have not been attended
to, yet we can have no doubt that they are general to the whole tribe.</p>
                  <p>It is common enough to take theſe animals into gardens, as
they are thought to deſtroy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects and ſnails in great abundance. We
are even told that, in hot countries, they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into a domeſtic
ſtate, as they are great deſtroyers of bugs. How ſo large and heavy an
animal is capable of being expert at ſuch petty prey, is not eaſy to
conceive; but I have <pb facs="tcp:0823900106:403"/>

gentlemen's houſes, that, in general, appear torpid, harmleſs and even fond
of employment. Children have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times got upon the back of a tortoiſe;
and ſuch was the creature's ſtrength, that it never ſeemed overloaded,
but moved off with its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to where it expected to be fed, but would carry
them no further. In winter they regularly find out a place to ſleep in; but
in thoſe warm countries in which the tortoiſe is found larger, and in
greater plenty than in Europe, they live without retiring the whole year
round.</p>
                  <p>The Sea Tortoiſe, or Turtle as it is now called, is
generally found larger than the former. This element is poſſeſſed with
the property of encreaſing the magnitude of thoſe animals, which are common
to the land and the ocean. The ſea pike is larger than that of freſh-water;
the ſea bear is larger than that of the mountains; and the ſea turtle
exceeds the land tortoiſe in the ſame proportion. It is of different
magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, according to its different kinds; ſome turtles being not above
fifty pound weight, and ſome above eight hundred.</p>
                  <p>The Great Meditèrranean Turtle is the largeſt of the
turtle kind with which we are acquainted. It is found from five to eight feet
long, and from ſix to nine hundred pounds <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0823900106:405"/> weight. But,
unluckily, its utility bears no proportion to its ſize; as it is unfit for
food, and ſometimes poiſon thoſe who eat it. The ſhell alſo, which is
a tough ſtrong integument, reſembling an hide, is unfit for all
ſerviceable purpoſes. One of theſe animals was taken in the year 1729, at
the mouth of the Loire, in nets that were not deſigned for ſo large a
capture. This turtle, which was of enormous ſtrength, by its own ſtruggles
involved itſelf in the nets in ſuch a manner as to be incapable of doing
miſchief: yet, even thus ſhackled, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared terrible to the
fiſhermen, who were at firſt for flying; but finding it impotent, they
gathered courage to drag it on ſhore, where it made a moſt horrible
bellowing; and when they began to knock it on the head with their gaffs, it was
to be heard at half a mile's diſtance. They were ſtill further intimidated
by its nauſeous and peſtilential breath, which ſo powerfully affected
them, that they were near fainting. This ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal wanted but four inches of
being eight feet long, and was above two feet over: its ſhell more
reſembled leather than the ſhell of a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe; and, unlike all other
animals of this kind, it was furniſhed with teeth in each jaw, one rank
behind another, like thoſe of a ſhark: its feet alſo, different from the
reſt of this kind, wanted claws; <pb n="395" facs="tcp:0823900106:406"/> and the tail was
quite diſengaged from the ſhell, and fifteen inches long, more reſembling
that of a quadrupede than a tortoiſe. This animal was then unknown upon the
coaſts of France; and was ſuppoſed to have been brought into the European
ſeas, in ſome India ſhip that might be wrecked upon her return. Since
that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, two or three of theſe animals have been taken upon the
coaſts; two in particular upon thoſe of Cornwall, in the year 1756, the
largeſt of which weighed eight hundred pounds; and one upon the Iſle of
Rhea, but two years before that, weighed between ſeven and eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
One, moſt probably of this kind alſo, was caught about thirty years ago
near Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and a good deal of company was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to feaſt upon it:
a gentleman, who was one of the gueſts, told the company that it was a
Mediterranean turtle, and not wholeſome; but a perſon who was willing to
ſatisfy his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite at the riſque of his life, eat of it: he was ſeized
with a violent vomiting and purging; but his conſtitution overpowered the
malignity of the poiſon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are a formidable and uſeleſs kind, if compared to
the turtle caught in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean. Theſe are of
different kinds; not only unlike each other <pb n="396" facs="tcp:0823900106:407"/> in form, but
furniſhing man with very different advantages. They are uſually
diſtinguiſhed by ſailors into four kinds; the Trunk Turtle, the
Loggerhead, the Hawkſbill, and the Green Turtle.</p>
                  <p>The Trunk Turtle is commonly larger than the reſt, and its
back higher and rounder. The fleſh of this is rank, and not very
wholeſome.</p>
                  <p>The Loggerhead is ſo called from the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its
head, which is much bigger in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion than that of the other kinds. The
fleſh of this alſo is very rank, and not eaten but in caſe of
neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>The Hawkſbill Turtle is the leaſt of the four, and has a
long and ſmall mouth, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the bill of an hawk. The
fleſh of this alſo is very indifferent eating; but the ſhell ſerves for
the moſt valuable purpoſes. This is the animal that ſupplies the
tortoiſe-ſhell of which ſuch a variety of beautiful trinkets are made.
The ſubſtance of which the ſhells of other turtles are compoſed, is
thin and porous; but that of the hawkſbill is firm, and, when po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, is
beautifully marbled. They generally carry about three pounds; but the largeſt
of all ſix pounds. The ſhell conſiſts, as in all the kind, of thirteen
leaves or plates, of which eight are flat, and five hollow. They are raiſed
and <pb n="397" facs="tcp:0823900106:408"/> taken off by means of fire, which is made under
under the ſhell after the fleſh is taken out. As ſoon as the heat affects
the leaves, they ſtart from the ribs, and are eaſily raiſed with the
point of a knife. By being ſcraped and poliſhed on both ſides, they
become beautifully tranſparent; or are eaſily caſt into what form the
workman thinks proper, by making them ſoft and pliant in warm water, and then
ſcrewing them in a mold, like a medal: however, the ſhell is moſt
beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful before it undergoes this laſt operation.</p>
                  <p>But of all animals of the tortoiſe kind, the green turtle is
the moſt noted, and the moſt valuable. The delicacy of its fleſh, and its
nutritive qualities, together with the property of being eaſily digeſted,
were, for above a century, known only to our ſea-men and the inhabitants of
the coaſts where they were taken. It was not till by ſlow degrees the
diſtinction came to be made between ſuch as were malignant and ſuch as
were wholeſome. The controverſies and contradictions of our old travellers
were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous upon this head; ſome aſſerting, that the turtle was
delicious food; and others, that it was actual poiſon. Dampier, that rough
ſea-man, who has added more to natural hiſtory than half of the
philoſophers that went before him, appears to be the firſt who informed us 
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0823900106:409"/> of their diſtinctions; and that, while the reſt
might be valuable for other purpoſes, the green turtle alone was chiefly
prized for the delicacy of its fleſh. He never imagined, however, that this
animal would make its way to the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious tables of Europe; for he ſeems
chiefly to recommend it as ſalted up for ſhip's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in caſe of
neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>At preſent the turtle is very well known among us; and is
become the favourite food of thoſe that are deſirous of eating a great deal
without the danger of ſurfeiting. This is a property the fleſh of the
turtle ſeems peculiarly poſſeſſed of; and by the importation of it
alive among us, gluttony is freed from one of its greateſt reſtraints. The
fleſh of turtle is become a branch of commerce; and therefore ſhips are
provided with conveniences for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them with water and proviſion, to
bring them over in health from Jamaica and other Weſt India iſlands. This,
however, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways effected; for though they are very viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and
ſcarce require any proviſion upon the voyage, yet, by the working of the
ſhip and their beating againſt the ſides of the boat that contains them,
they become battered and lean; ſo that to eat this animal in the higheſt
perfection, inſtead of bringing the turtle to <pb n="399" facs="tcp:0823900106:410"/> the
epicure, he ought to be tranſported to the turtle.</p>
                  <p>This animal is called the green turtle, from the colour of its
ſhell, which is rather greener than that of others of this kind. It is
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally found about two hundred weight; though ſome are five hundred, and
others not above fifty. Dampier tells us of one that was ſeen at Port Royal
in Jamaica, that was ſix feet broad acroſs the back: he does not tell us
its other dimenſions; but ſays, that the ſon of Captain Roach, a boy
about ten years old, ſailed in the ſhell, as in a boat, from the ſhore to
his father's ſhip, which was above a quarter of a mile from land. But this is
nothing to the ſize of ſome turtles the ancients ſpeak of. Aelian
aſſures us, that the houſes in the Iſland of Taprobane are uſually
covered with a ſingle ſhell. Diodorus Siculus tells us, that a people
neighbouring on Ethiopia, called the Turtle-eaters, coaſted along the ſhore
in boats made of the upper ſhell of this animal; and that in war, when they
had eaten the fleſh, the covering ſerved them as a tent. In this account,
Pliny, and all the reſt of the ancients agree; and as they had frequent
oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of knowing the truth, we are not lightly to contradict their
teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>At preſent, however, they are not ſeen of 
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0823900106:411"/> ſuch amazing dimenſions. We are told, by Laet, that
on the Iſle of Cuba they grow to ſuch a ſize, as that five men can
ſtand on the back of one of them together; and what is more ſurprizing
ſtill, that the animal does not ſeem overloaded, but will go off with them
upon its back, with a ſlow ſteady motion, towards the ſea.</p>
                  <p>They are found in the greateſt numbers on the Iſland of
Aſcenſion; where, for ſeveral years, they were taken to be ſalted to
feed the ſlaves, or for a ſupply of ſhip's proviſion. Their value at
preſent ſeems to be better known.</p>
                  <p>This animal ſeldom comes from the ſea but to depoſit its
eggs, and now and then to ſport in freſh-water. Its chief food is a
ſubmarine plant, that covers the bottom of ſeveral parts of the ſea not
far from the ſhore. There the turtles are ſeen, when the weather is fair,
feeding in great numbers, like flocks of ſheep, ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms deep upon
the verdant carpet below. At other times they go to the mouths of rivers, as
they ſeem to find gratification in freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water. After ſome time thus
employed, they ſeek their former ſtations; and when done feeding, they
generally float with their heads above water, unleſs they are alarmed by the
approach of hunters or birds of prey, in which <pb n="401" facs="tcp:0823900106:412"/> caſe
they ſuddenly plunge to the bottom. They often ſeek their proviſion among
the rocks, feeding upon moſs and ſea-weed; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable will not
diſdain to prey upon inſects and other ſmall animals, as they are very
fond of fleſh when taken and fed for the table.</p>
                  <p>At the time of breeding, they are ſeen to forſake their
former haunts and their food, and to take ſometimes a voyage of nine hundred
miles to depoſite their eggs on ſome favourite ſhore. The coaſts they
always reſort to upon theſe occaſions are thoſe that are low, flat, and
ſandy; for being heavy animals, they cannot climb a bold ſhore; nor is any
bed ſo proper as ſand to lay their eggs on. They couple in March, and
continue united till May; during a great part of which time they are ſeen
locked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and almoſt incapable of ſeparation. The female ſeems
paſſive and reluctant; but the male graſps her with his claws in ſuch a
manner, that nothing can induce him to quit his hold. It would ſeem that the
graſp, as in frogs, is in ſome meaſure convulſive, and that the animal
is unable to relax its efforts.</p>
                  <p>When the time for laying approaches, the female is ſeen
towards the ſetting of the ſun drawing near the ſhore, and looking
earneſtly about her, as if afraid of being diſcovered. 
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0823900106:413"/> When ſhe perceives any perſon on ſhore, ſhe
ſeeks for another place; but if otherwiſe, ſhe lands when it is dark, and
goes to take a ſurvey of the ſand where ſhe deſigns to lay. Having
marked the ſpot, ſhe goes back without laying for that night, to the ocean
again; but the next night returns to depoſite a part of her burthen. She
begins by woking and digging in the ſand with her fore-feet till ſhe has
made a round hole, a foot broad and a foot and an half deep, juſt at the
place a little above where the water reaches higheſt. This done, ſhe lays
eighty or ninety eggs at a time, each as big as a hen's egg, and as round as a
ball. She continues laying about the ſpace of an hour; during which time, if
a cart were driven over her, ſhe would not be induced to ſtir. The eggs are
covered with a tough white ſkin, like wetted parchment. When ſhe has done
laying, ſhe covers the hole ſo dexterouſly, that it is no eaſy matter
to find the place; and theſe muſt be accuſtomed to the ſearch to make
the diſcovery. When the turtle has done laying ſhe returns to the ſea,
and leaves her eggs to be hatched by the heat of the ſun. At the end of
fifteen days ſhe lays about the ſame number of eggs again; and at the end
of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fifteen days ſhe repeats the ſame; three <pb n="403" facs="tcp:0823900106:414"/>
times in all, uſing the ſame precautions every time for their
ſafety..</p>
                  <p>In about twenty-four or twenty-five days after laying, the
eggs are hatched by the heat of the ſun; and the young turtles, being about
as big as quails, are ſeen burſting from the ſand, as if earth-born, and
running directly to the ſea, with inſtinct only for their guide: but, to
their great misfortune, it often happens that, their ſtrength being ſmall,
the ſurges of the ſea, for ſome few days, beat them back upon the
ſhore. Thus expoſed, they remain a prey to thouſands of birds that then
haunt the coaſts; and theſe ſtooping down upon them carry off the
greateſt part, and ſometimes the whole brood, before they have ſtrength
ſufficient to withſtand the waves, or dive to the bottom. Helbigius informs
us, that they have ſtill another enemy to fear, which is no other than the
parent that produced them, that waits for their arrival at the edge of the
deep, and devours as many as ſhe can. This circumſtance however demands
further confirmation; though nothing is more certain than that the crocodile
acts in the ſame unnatural manner.</p>
                  <p>When the turtles have done laying they then return to their
accuſtomed places of feeding. <pb n="404" facs="tcp:0823900106:415"/> Upon their out-ſet to
the ſhore, where they breed, they are always found fat and healthy; but upon
their return, they are weak, lean, and unfit to be eaten. They are ſeldom,
therefore, moleſted upon their retreat; but the great art is to ſeize them
when arrived, or to intercept their arrival. In theſe uninhabited iſlands,
to which the green turtle chiefly reſorts, the men that go to take them land
about night-fall, and without making any noiſe (for thoſe animals, though
without any external opening of the ear, hear very diſtinctly, there being an
auditory conduit that opens into the mouth) lie cloſe while they ſee the
female turtle coming on ſhore. They let her proceed to her greateſt
diſtance from the ſea; and then, when ſhe is moſt buſily employed in
ſcratching a hole in the ſand, they ſally out and ſurprize her. Their
manner is to turn her upon her back, which utterly incapacitates her from
moving; and yet, as the creature is very ſtrong and ſtruggles very hard,
two men find it no eaſy matter to lay her over. When thus ſecured they go
to the next; and in this manner, in leſs than three hours, they have been
known to turn forty or fifty turtles, each of which weighs from an hundred and
fifty to two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. Labat aſſures us that when 
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0823900106:416"/> the animal is in this helpleſs ſituation, it is
heard to ſigh very heavily, and even to ſhed tears.</p>
                  <p>At preſent, from the great appetite that man has
diſcovered for this animal, they are not only thinned in their numbers, but
are alſo grown much more ſhy. There are ſeveral other ways, therefore,
contrived for taking them. One is, to ſeize them when coupled together, at
the breeding ſeaſon, when they are very eaſily approached, and as
eaſily ſeen; for theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, though capable of living for ſome time
under water, yet riſe every eight or ten minutes to breathe. As ſoon as
they are thus perceived, two or three people draw near them in a canoe, and
ſlip a nooze either round their necks or one of their feet. If they have no
line, they lay hold of them by the neck, where they have no ſhell, with their
hands only; and by this means they uſually catch them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But
ſometimes the female eſcapes, being more ſhy than the male.</p>
                  <p>Another way of taking them is by the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon, either when
they are playing on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water, or feeding on the bottom; when
the harpoon is ſkilfully darted, it ſticks faſt in the ſhell of the
back; the wood then diſengages from the iron, and the line is long 
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0823900106:417"/> enough for the animal to take its range; for if the
Harpooner ſhould attempt at once to draw the animal into his boat till it is
weakened by its own ſtruggling, it would probably get free. Thus the turtle
ſtruggles hard to get looſe, but all in vain; for they take care the line
faſtened to the harpoon ſhall be ſtrong enough to hold it.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another way which, though ſeemingly awkward, is
ſaid to be attended with very great ſucceſs. A good diver places
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the head of the boat; and when the turtles are obſerved, which
they ſometimes are in great numbers, aſleep on the ſurface, he
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately quits the veſſel, at about fifty yards diſtance, and keeping
ſtill under water, directs his paſſage to where the turtle was ſeen,
and, coming up beneath, ſeizes it by the tail; the animal awaking,
ſtruggles to get free; and by this both are kept at the ſurface until the
boat arrives to take them in.</p>
