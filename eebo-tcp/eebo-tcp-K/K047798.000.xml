            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE want of a proper ſet of exerciſes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the different branches of mathematical knowledge, which are deemed requiſite to the military profeſſion, induced me to draw up the following ſheets. Their utility to the ſtudents in the Royal Military Academy, having been fully eſtabliſhed, recommended them to the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Maſter General; and His Grace has been pleaſed to order them to be printed.</p>
            <p>The miſcellaneous form of this ſmall work, ariſes from its conſiſting chiefly of practical queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in moſt of the ſciences now taught in the Academy. Although Invention was not my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object, yet throughout the whole there will be found many things that are new, in
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1175700500:6"/>point of matter, but more ſo in the manner of treating the ſubjects.</p>
            <p>In the Conic Sections there are ſeveral new and important properties diſperſed through the books; and it is preſumed that this branch is treated in a way better adapted to its intended uſe, than heretofore. The propoſitions, although demonſtrated in a manner ſtrictly geometrical, have this peculiarity, that only the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of each ſection is demonſtrated from the cone itſelf, and all the ſubſequent ones derived from the firſt, or from each other, in an eaſy and natural way, without introducing any arbitrary organical deſcription of curves in plano. The arrangement of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eps in ſeparate lines is alſo found to be an advantage, as it renders the demonſtrations more eaſy to be comprehended, by preſenting the whole to the eye in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected view. And another very conſiderable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement ariſes from the application of a new and general property concerning the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections of a right line, with any of the curves, in two points: by means of which the general properties of the oblique ordinates, to any dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, are eaſily deduced, without the forced and perplexed conſideration of the areas of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpaces.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral propoſitions and properties, in the three curves or ſections, are alſo arranged in ſuch
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1175700500:7"/>order, and enunciated in ſuch manner, as to ſhew which properties are common to the different ſections; and in particular it will be found, that moſt of the definitions and ſcholia are common to all the three curves; and that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and demonſtrations of the ellipſe, are literally the ſame with thoſe of the hyperbola: a circumſtance which muſt render both the learning and the remembering of the properties much eaſier than heretofore.</p>
            <p>The collection of practical queſtions, which follow the Conic Sections, are moſtly given without ſolutions, their anſwers only being ſet down, as probationary exerciſes to certain rules and branches of ſcience contained in moſt books relating to theſe ſubjects. But the laſt collection, concerning forces, and the accompanying cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time, ſpace, and the velocity ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, have ſolutions annexed to them; as they require a knowledge of ſome other principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that are uſually found in the common books of ſcience. Many of the problems in this part may, indeed, be met with elſewhere; but it is preſumed, that the ſolutions will be found in general, either new, or attended with conſiderable improvement.</p>
            <p>I have taken the liberty alſo to enrich this part with ſome new and uſeful problems relating
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:1175700500:8"/>to the times of filling and emptying the ditches of fortifications, or other receptacles, with water, entering and evacuating them under certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Theſe curious problems, His Grace the Maſter General of the Ordnance was pleaſed to propoſe at a late examination of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen Cadets; and the ſolutions at large, of ſuch important propoſitions, are here publiſhed, as far as I know, for the firſt time.</p>
            <p>To theſe ſucceeds the common theory of the motion of bodies in reſiſting mediums, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in a manner, I truſt, better adapted to practical purpoſes than in any former publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The volume then concludes with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of ſome experiments, lately made to aſcertain the actual reſiſtance of the air to given ſurfaces, moving through it with given velocities, and different degrees of inclination: experiments, which it is to be wiſhed may be farther proſecuted, as it is by ſuch means only that the true theory of military projectiles, as well as other branches of natural philoſophy, can be improved to any degree of practical utility.</p>

               <head>DEFINITIONS.</head>
               <p n="1">1. CONIC ſections are the figures made by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual interſection of a cone and a plane.</p>
               <p n="2">2. According to the different poſitions of the cutting plane, there ariſe five different figures or ſections, namely, a triangle, a circle, an ellipſe, a parabola, and an hyperbola: the three laſt of which only are peculiarly called conic ſections.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the cutting plane paſs through the vertex of the cone, and any part of the baſe, the ſection will evidently be a triangle; as VAB.</p>
               <figure>
                  <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p n="4">4. If the plane cut the cone parallel to the baſe, or make no angle with it, the ſection will be a circle; as ABD.</p>
               <figure>
                  <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1175700500:11"/>5. The ſection DAB is an ellipſe, when the cone is cut obliquely through both ſides, or when the plane is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the baſe in a leſs angle than the ſide of the cone is.</p>
               <figure>
                  <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p n="6">6. The ſection is a parabola, when the cone is cut by a plane parallel to the baſe, or when the cutting plane and the ſide of the cone make equal angles with the baſe.</p>
               <figure>
                  <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p n="7">7. The ſection is an hyperbola, when the cutting plane makes a greater angle with the baſe than the ſide of the cone makes.</p>
               <figure>
                  <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p n="8">8. And if all the ſides of the cone be continued through the vertex, forming an oppoſite equal cone, and the plane be alſo continued to cut the oppoſite cone, this latter ſection will be the oppoſite hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola to the former; as dBe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The vertices of any ſection, are the points where the cutting plane meets the oppoſite ſides of the cone, or the ſides of the vertical triangular ſection; as A and B.</p>
               <p>Hence the ellipſe and the oppoſite hyperbolas, have each two vertices; but the parabola only one; unleſs we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the other as at an infinite diſtance.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Axis, or Tranſverſe Diameter, of a conic ſection, is the line or diſtance AB between the vertices.</p>
               <p>Hence the axis of a parabola is infinite in length, Ab being only a part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1175700500:12"/>Ellipſe.</p>
               <p>Oppos. Hyperb.</p>
               <p>Parabola.</p>

               <figure>
                  <head>Parabola.</head>
               </figure>
               <p n="11">11. The Center C is the middle of the axis.</p>
               <p>Hence the center of a parabola is infinitely diſtant from the vertex. And of an ellipſe the axis and center lie within the curve; but of an hyperbola without.</p>
               <p n="12">12. A Diameter is any right line, as AB or DE, drawn through the center, and terminated on each ſide by the curve; and the extremities of the diameter, or its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections with the curve, are its vertices.</p>
               <p>Hence all the diameters of a parabola are parallel to the axis, and infinite in length. And hence alſo every diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ellipſe and hyperbola have two vertices; but of the parabola only one; unleſs we conſider the other as at an infinite diſtance.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The Conjugate to any diameter, is the line drawn through the center, and parallel to the tangent of the curve at the vertex of the diameter. So FG, parallel to the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent at D, is the conjugate to DE; and HI, parallel to the tangent at A, is the conjugate to AB.</p>
               <p>Hence the conjugate HI, of the axis AB, is perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to it.</p>

               <p>In theſe four theorems, the force <hi>f,</hi> though variable, is ſuppoſed to be conſtant for the indefinitely ſmall time <hi>t;</hi> and they are to be uſed in all caſes of variable forces, as the former ones in conſtant forces; namely, from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1175700500:179"/>of the problem under conſideration, deduce an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion for the value of the force <hi>f,</hi> which ſubſtitute in one of theſe theorems, which ſhall be proper to the caſe in hand, and the equation thence reſulting will determine the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding values of the other quantities required in the problem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note.</hi> That the motive force <hi>m,</hi> of a body, is equal to <hi>fq,</hi> the product of the accelerative force, and the quantity of matter in it; and, therefore, <hi>m</hi> will be found by ſubſtituting <hi>m</hi>/<hi>q</hi> for <hi>f</hi> in the theorems above.</p>
               <p>Alſo the momentum, or quantity of motion, is <hi>q v,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the velocity and matter.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be obſerved, that the theorems equally hold good for the deſtruction of motion and velocity, by means of retarding forces, as for the generation of the ſame by means of accelerating forces.</p>
               <p>And to the following problems, which are all reſolved by the application of theſe theorems, it has been thought proper to ſubjoin their ſolutions, for the better information and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the ſtudent.</p>
               <p>The following table of the moſt common and uſeful forms of fluxions and fluents, is inſerted, as it will be found very uſeful for aſſigning the fluents found in many of the following problems.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note.</hi> The logarithms mentioned in the fluents, are the hyperbolic ones, and the radius of the circle is 1.</p>

                  <p>To any point G draw the tangent GP, alſo draw GQ parallel and PQ perpendicular to AD. Then PG is parallel to the chord AI by the nature of the curve. And, by the nature of forces, the force of gravity ∶ force in direct. GP ∷ GP ∶ GQ ∷ AI ∶ AH ∷ AD ∶ AI; in like manner, the force of grav. ∶ force in curve at E ∷ AD ∶ AK; that is, the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerative force in the curve, is as the correſponding chord AI or AK of the circle, or as the arc AG or AE of the cycloid, ſince AG is always = 2AI. So that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and concluſions for the velocity and time of deſcribing any arc in this caſe, will be the ſame as in the laſt problem.</p>
                  <p>From whence it follows that the time of a ſemi-vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in all arcs, AG, AE, &amp;c, is the ſame conſtant quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

                  <p>Since the time of a body's falling by gravity through ½<hi>l,</hi> or half the length of the pendulum, is √ <hi>l</hi>/2<hi>g,</hi> which being in proportion to 3.1416 √ <hi>l</hi>/2<hi>g,</hi> as 1 to 3.1416; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diameter of a circle is to its circumference, as the time of falling through half the length of a pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, to the time of one vibration.</p>
                  <p>If the time of the whole vibration be 1 ſecond, this equation ariſes, 1″ = 3.1416 √ <hi>l</hi>/2<hi>g,</hi> and hence <hi>l</hi> = 2<hi>g</hi>/3.1416<hi rend="sup">2</hi> = <hi>g</hi>/4.9348, and <hi>g</hi> = 3.1416<hi rend="sup">2</hi> × ½<hi>l</hi> = 4.9348<hi>l.</hi> So that if one of theſe, <hi>g</hi> or <hi>l,</hi> be given by experiment, theſe equations will give the other. When <hi>g,</hi> for inſtance, is ſuppoſed to be 16 1/12 feet, or 193 inches, then is <hi>l</hi> = <hi>g</hi>/4.9348 = 39.11 the length of a pendulum to vibrate ſeconds. Or if <hi>l</hi> = 39⅛, the length of the ſeconds pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum for the latitude of London, then is <hi>g</hi> = 4.9348 <hi>l</hi> = 193.07 inches = 16 107/1200 feet, or nearly 16 1/12 feet, for the ſpace deſcended by gravity in the firſt ſecond of time in the latitude of London.</p>
                  <p>Hence the times of vibration of pendulums, are as the ſquare roots of their lengths; and the number of vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made in a given time, reciprocally as the ſquare roots of the lengths. And hence the length of a pendulum
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1175700500:197"/>vibrating <hi>n</hi> times in a minute, or 60″, is <hi>l</hi> = 39 1/8 × 60<hi rend="sup">2</hi>/<hi>n2</hi> = 140850/<hi>nn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When a pendulum vibrates in a circular arc, as the length of the ſtring is conſtantly the ſame, the time of vibration will be longer than in a cycloid; but the two times will approach nearer together as the circular arc is ſmaller; ſo that when it is very ſmall, the times of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration will be nearly equal.

                  <p>Hence it follows that the time loſt in each ſecond, by vibrating in a circle, inſtead of the cycloid, is D<hi rend="sup">2</hi>/51150; and conſequently the time loſt in a whole day of 24 hours, or 24 × 60 × 60 ſeconds, is 5/3 D<hi rend="sup">2</hi> nearly.

                  <p>It is propoſed to determine the Velocity, and the Time of Vibration, of a Fluid in the Arms of a Canal or bent Tube.</p>
                  <p>Let the tube ABCDEF have its two branches AC, GE vertical, and the lower part CDE in any poſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the whole being of a uniform diameter or width throughout. Let water, or quickſilver, or any other fluid, be poured in, till it ſtand in equilibrio, at any horizontal line BF. Then let one ſurface be preſſed or puſhed down by ſhaking, from B to C, and the other will aſcend through the equal ſpace FG; after which let them be permitted freely to return. The ſurfaces will then continually vibrate in equal times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween AC and EG. The velocity and times of which oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillations are therefore required.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>When the ſurfaces are any where out of a horizontal line, as at P and Q, the parts of the fluid in QDR, on each ſide, below QR, will balance each other; and the weight of the part in PR, which is equal to 2PF, gives motion to the whole So that the weight of the part 2PF is the motive force by which the whole fluid is urged, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wt of 2PF / whole wt. is the accelerative force. Which weights being proportional to their lengths, if <hi>l</hi> be the length of the whole fluid, or axis of the tube filled, and <hi>a</hi> = FG or BC; then is <hi>a</hi>/<hi>l</hi> the accelerative force.

                  <p>Again, for the time, we have <hi>ṫ</hi> or <gap reason="math">

And when <hi>x</hi> = <hi>a,</hi> it becomes <hi>t</hi> = ¼ <hi>p</hi> √ <hi>l</hi>/<hi>g</hi> for the time of moving from G to F, <hi>p</hi> being = 3.1416; and conſequently ½ <hi>p</hi> √ <hi>l</hi>/<hi>g</hi> the time of a whole vibration from G to E, or from C to A. And which therefore is the ſame, whatever AB is, the whole length <hi>l</hi> remaining the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And the time of vibration is alſo equal to the time of the vibration of a pendulum whoſe length is ½<hi>l,</hi> or half the length of the axis of the fluid. So that if the length <hi>l</hi> be 78¼ inches, it will oſcillate in 1 ſecond.</p>
                  <p>SCHOL. This reciprocation of the water in the canal, is nearly ſimilar to the motion of the waves of the ſea. For the time of vibration is the ſame, however ſhort the branches are, provided the whole length be the ſame. So that when the height is ſmall, in proportion to the length
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1175700500:217"/>of the canal, the motion is ſimilar to that of a wave, from the top to the bottom or hollow, and from the bottom to the top of the next wave; being equal to two vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the canal; the whole length of a wave, from top to top, being double the length of the canal. Hence the wave will move forward by a ſpace nearly equal to its breadth, in the time of two vibrations of a pendulum whoſe length is (½<hi>l</hi>) half the length of the canal, or one fourth of the breadth of a wave, or in the time of one vibration of a pendulum whoſe length is the whole breadth of the wave, ſince the times of vibration are as the ſquare roots of their lengths. Conſequently, waves whoſe breadth is equal to 39⅛ inches, or 3 25/96 feet, will move over 3 2/9 ⅚ feet in a ſecond, or 195⅝ feet in a minute, or nearly 2 miles and a quarter in an hour. And the velocity of greater or leſs waves will be increaſed or diminiſhed in the ſubduplicate ratio of their breadths.</p>

                  <p>To determine the Force of Fluids in Motion. And the Circumſtances attending Bodies moving in Fluids.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is evident that the reſiſtance to a plane, moving perpendicularly through an infinite fluid, at reſt, is equal to the preſſure or force of the fluid upon the plane at reſt, and the fluid moving with the ſame velocity, and in the contrary direction, to that of the plane in the former caſe. But the force of the fluid in motion, muſt be equal to the weight or preſſure which generates that motion; and which, it is known, is equal to the weight or preſſure of a column of the fluid, whoſe baſe is equal to the plane, and its altitude equal to the height through which a body muſt fall, by the force of gravity, to acquire the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the fluid: and that altitude is, for the ſake of brevity, called the altitude due to the velocity. So that, if <hi>a</hi> denote the area of the plane, <hi>v</hi> the velocity, and <hi>n</hi> the ſpecific gravity of the fluid; then, the altitude due to the velocity <hi>v</hi> being <hi>v2</hi>/4<hi>g,</hi> the whole reſiſtance, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force <hi>m,</hi> will be <hi>a</hi> × <hi>n</hi> × <hi>v2</hi>/4<hi>g</hi> = <hi>anv2</hi>/4<hi>g</hi>; <hi>g</hi> being 16 1/12 feet. And hence, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the reſiſtance is as the ſquare of the velocity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ratio, of the ſquare of the velocity, may be otherwiſe derived thus. The force of the fluid in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be as the force of one particle multiplied by
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1175700500:231"/>the number of them: but the force of a particle is as its velocity; and the number that ſtrikes the plane in a given time, is alſo as the velocity; therefore the whole force is as <hi>v</hi> × <hi>v</hi> or <hi>v2</hi>, that is, as the ſquare of the velocity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the direction of motion, inſtead of being perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to the plane, as above ſuppoſed, were inclined to it in any angle, the ſine of that angle being <hi>s,</hi> to the radius 1; then the reſiſtance to the plane, or the force of the fluid againſt the plane, in the direction of the motion, as aſſigned above, will be diminiſhed in the triplicate ratio of radius to the ſine of the angle of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or in the ratio of 1 to <hi>s3</hi>. For, AB being the direction of the plane, and BD that of the motion, making the angle ABD, whoſe ſine is <hi>s;</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of particles, or quantity of the fluid, ſtriking the plane, will be diminiſhed in the ratio of 1 to <hi>s,</hi> or of radius to the ſine of the angle B of inclination; and the force of each particle will alſo be diminiſhed in the ſame ratio of 1 to <hi>s;</hi> ſo that, on both theſe accounts, the whole reſiſtance will be diminiſhed in the ratio of 1 to <hi>s2</hi>, or in the duplicate ratio of radius to the ſine of the ſaid angle. But again, it is to be conſidered that this whole reſiſtance is exerted in the direction BE perpendicular to the plane; and any force in the direction BE, is to its effect in the direction AE, parallel to BD, as AE to BF, that is as 1 to <hi>s.</hi> So that finally, on all theſe accounts, the reſiſtance in the direction of motion, is diminiſhed in the ratio of 1 to <hi>s3</hi>, or in the triplicate ratio of radius to the fine of inclination. Hence, comparing this with article 1, the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or the motive force on the plane, will be <hi>m</hi> = <hi>anv2</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Since ⅙<hi>pd3</hi> is the magnitude of the globe, if N de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note its denſity or ſpecific gravity, its weight <hi>w</hi> will be = ⅙<hi>pd3</hi> N, and therefore the retardive force <hi>f</hi> or <hi>m</hi>/<hi>w</hi> = <hi>pnv2</hi>
                     <hi>d2</hi>/32<hi>g</hi> × 6/<hi>p</hi>N<hi>d3</hi> = 3<hi>nv2</hi>/16<hi>g</hi>N<hi>d</hi>; which is alſo = <hi>v2</hi>/4<hi>gs</hi> by art. 8 of the general theorems in page 169; hence then 3<hi>n</hi>/4N<hi>d</hi> = 1/<hi>s,</hi> and s = N / <hi>n</hi> × 4/3 <hi>d,</hi> which is the ſpace that would be deſcribed by the globe, while its whole motion is generated or deſtroyed by a conſtant force which is equal to the force of reſiſtance, if no other force acted on the globe to continue its motion. And if the denſity of the fluid were equal to that of the globe, the reſiſting force is ſuch, as, acting conſtantly on the globe without any other force, would generate or deſtroy its motion in deſcribing the ſpace 4/3<hi>d,</hi> by that accelerating or retarding force.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hence the greateſt velocity that a globe will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by deſcending in a fluid, by means of its relative weight in the fluid, will be found by making the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Ex. If a leaden ball, of 1 inch diameter, deſcend in water, and in air of the ſame denſity as at the earth's ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, the three ſpecific gravities being as 11⅓, and 1,

                     </gap> is the greateſt velocity it can acquire in air.</p>
                  <p>But if the globe were only 1/100 of an inch diameter, the greateſt velocities it could acquire, would be only 1/10 of theſe, namely 86/100 of a foot in water, and 26 feet nearly in air.

                  <p>From this table of reſiſtances, ſeveral practical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences may be drawn. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the reſiſtance is nearly as the ſurface; the reſiſtance increaſing but a very little above that proportion in the greater ſurfaces. Thus, by comparing together the numbers in the 6th and laſt columns, for the baſes of the two hemiſpheres, the areas of which are in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 17¾ to 32, or as 5 to 9 very nearly; but the numbers in thoſe two columns, expreſſing the reſiſtances are nearly as 1 to 2, or as 5 to 10, as far as to the velocity
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1175700500:245"/>of 12 feet; after which the reſiſtances on the greater ſurface increaſe gradually more and more above that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. And the mean reſiſtances are as 140 to 288, or as 5 to 10 2/7. This circumſtance therefore agrees nearly with the theory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reſiſtance to the ſame ſurface, is nearly as the ſquare of the velocity; but gradually increaſes more and more above that proportion as the velocity increaſes. This is manifeſt from all the columns. And therefore this circumſtance alſo nearly agrees with the theory, in ſmall velocities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the hinder parts of bodies are of different forms, the reſiſtances are different, though the fore parts be alike; owing probably to the different preſſures of the air on the hinder parts. Thus, the reſiſtance to the fore part of the cylinder is leſs than that on the flat baſe of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, or of the cone; becauſe the hinder part of the cylinder is more preſſed or puſhed, by the following air, than thoſe of the other two figures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The reſiſtance on the baſe of the hemiſphere, is to that on the convex ſide, nearly as 2⅖ to 1, inſtead of 2 to 1, as the theory aſſigns the proportion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this particular, the theory is attended with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable error.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The reſiſtance on the baſe of the cone, is to that on the vertex, nearly as 2 3/10 to 1, inſtead of 5¼ to 1, as the theory in pa. 223 art. 6 requires it to be. So that the theory in this inſtance gives leſs than half the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Hence we can find the altitude of a column of air, whoſe preſſure ſhall be equal to the reſiſtance of a body, moving through it with any velocity.</p>

                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:1175700500:246"/>Let <hi>a</hi> = the area of the ſection of the body, ſimilar to any of thoſe in the table, perpendicular to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of motion; <hi>r</hi> = the reſiſtance to the velocity in the table; and <hi>x</hi> = the altitude ſought, of a column of air, whoſe baſe is <hi>a,</hi> and its preſſure <hi>r.</hi> Then <hi>ax</hi> = the content of the column in feet, and 1⅕<hi>ax</hi> or 6/5<hi>ax</hi> its weight in ounces; therefore 6/5<hi>ax</hi> = <hi>r,</hi> and <hi>x</hi> = ⅚ × <hi>r</hi>/<hi>a</hi> is the altitude ſought in feet, namely ⅚ of the quotient of the reſiſtance of any body divided by its tranſverſe ſection; which is a conſtant quantity for all ſimilar bodies, however different in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, ſince the reſiſtance <hi>r</hi> is as the ſection <hi>a,</hi> as we have found in art. 1. When <hi>a</hi> = 2/9 of a foot, as in all the figures in our table, except the ſmall hemiſphere; then <hi>x</hi> = ⅚ × <hi>r</hi>/<hi>a</hi> becomes <hi>x</hi> = 15/4 <hi>r,</hi> where <hi>r</hi> is the reſiſtance in our table to the ſimilar body. If, for example, we take the convex ſide of the large hemiſphere, whoſe reſiſtance is .634 oz to a velocity of 16 feet per ſecond; then <hi>r</hi> = .634, and <hi>x</hi> = 15/4 <hi>r</hi> = 2.3775 feet, is the altitude of the column of air whoſe preſſure is equal to the reſiſtance on a ſpherical ſurface with a velocity of 16 feet. And to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the above altitude with that which is due to the given velocity, it will be 32<hi rend="sup">2</hi> ∶ 16<hi rend="sup">2</hi> ∷ 16 ∶ 4 the altitude due to the velocity 16; which is near double the altitude that is equal to the preſſure. And as the altitude is proportional to the ſquare of the velocity, therefore, in ſmall velocities, the reſiſtance to any ſpherical ſurface, is equal to the preſſure of a column of air on its great circle, whoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is 19/32 or .594 of the altitude due to its velocity.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Hence we may infer the great reſiſtance ſuffered by military projectiles. For we find in the table that a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1175700500:247"/>globe of 6⅜ inches diameter, which is equal to the ſize of an iron ball weighing 36 lb, moving with a velocity of only 16 feet per ſecond, meets with a reſiſtance equal to the preſſure of ⅔ of an ounce weight; and therefore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting only according to the ſquare of the velocity, the leaſt reſiſtance that ſuch a ball would meet with, when moving with a velocity of 1600 feet, would be equal to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of 417 lb, and that independent of the preſſure of the atmoſphere itſelf on the fore part of the ball, which would be 480 lb more, as there would be no preſſure from the atmoſphere on the hinder part, in the caſe of ſo great a velocity as 1600 feet per ſecond. So that the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance would not be leſs than about 900 lb to ſuch a velocity.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Having ſaid in the laſt article that the preſſure of the atmoſphere is taken intirely off the hinder part of the ball, moving with a velocity of 1600 feet per ſecond; which muſt happen when the ball moves faſter than the particles of air can follow by ruſhing into the place quitted and left void by the ball, or when the ball moves faſter than the air ruſhes into a vacuum from the preſſure of the incumbent air. Let us therefore inquire what this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity is. Now the velocity with which any fluid iſſues, depends upon its altitude above the orifice, and is indeed equal to the velocity acquired by a heavy body in falling freely through that altitude. But, ſuppoſing the height of the barometer to be 30 inches or 2½ feet, the height of an uniform atmoſphere, all of the ſame denſity as at the earth's ſurface, would be 2½ × 14 × 833⅓ or 29166 feet; therefore √16 ∶ √29166 ∷ 32 ∶ 8√29166 = 1366 feet, which is the velocity ſought. And therefore with a velocity of 1600 feet per ſecond, or any velocity above 1366 feet, the ball muſt continually leave a vacuum behind it, and ſo muſt ſuſtain the whole preſſure of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1175700500:248"/>atmoſphere on its fore part, as well as the reſiſtance ariſing from the vis inertia of the particles of air ſtruck by the ball.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Upon the whole we find that the reſiſtance of the air, as determined by our experiments, differs very widely, both in reſpect to the quantity of it on all figures, and in reſpect to the proportions of it on oblique ſurfaces, from the ſame as determined by the preceding theory, which is the ſame as that of Sir Iſaac Newton, and moſt modern philoſophers. Neither ſhould we ſucceed better if we have recourſe to the theory given by profeſſor Graveſande, or others, as ſimilar differences and inconſiſtencies ſtill occur.</p>
                  <p>We conclude therefore that all the theories of the reſiſtance of the air hitherto given, are very erroneous. And I have only laid down the preceding one, till further experiments on this important ſubject ſhall enable us to deduce from them, another, that ſhall be more conſonant to the true phenomena of nature.</p>
