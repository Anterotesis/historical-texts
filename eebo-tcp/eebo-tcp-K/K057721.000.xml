            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>FLY, comic ſcenes! where diſtant Ganges laves</l>
               <l>Hindoſtan's golden ſhores, with hallow'd waves;</l>
               <l>Where palms gigantic rear their tufted heads,</l>
               <l>And nature in coloſſal vegetation ſpreads,</l>
               <l>Where rich ananas court the Indian's eye,</l>
               <l>And groves of citrons fan the fev'riſh ſky,</l>
               <l>Where rattling canes around the riv'lets play,</l>
               <l>And the centennial aloe drinks the day!</l>
               <l>In their deep ſhades bid Lucidorus ſmile,</l>
               <l>His heavy ſenſe of <hi>diſtant</hi> hours beguile.</l>
               <l>Bid him not think, becauſe I gaily write,</l>
               <l>That heavy hours to him, to me, are light;</l>
               <l>My native ſpirits, bounding from repoſe,</l>
               <l>Bear me, unwilling, where Caſtalia flows.</l>
               <l>I love to weep, love the ſoft feaſt of grief,</l>
               <l>Court mournful thoughts, nor ever wiſh relief;—</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Sadneſs</hi> I woo, yet ſtill the phantom flies,</l>
               <l>And <hi>joy</hi> ſeduces, whilſt I aſk for ſighs.</l>
               <l>

But Hymen frowns, and joy no longer cheers,</l>
               <l>Weeping, I ſink—Thalia drinks my tears:</l>
               <l>He tears my heart; ſhe my rapt ſoul inſpires;</l>
               <l>He chills with grief; ſhe fills me with her fires.</l>

                  <p>Your patient, Sir, is as well as a patient can be, who is out of the reach of his d—d Doctor. No further occaſion for aſſes milk, ſtimulatives, balſamics, or coolers.</p>

                  <p>Alas, poor Doctor!—no more fees—he has given you the <hi>go-by</hi> fairly. Is it not a ſhame that a man of your proweſs in the fields of Galen, ſhould not be able to conquer ſuch a pitiful hectic as drove him him out of the world? why, a phyſician ought to have the diſeaſes at his call, and whiſtle them on and off, as a huntſman does his hounds.</p>

                  <p>Aye, 'twas a crying ſin, to let ſuch a ſpirited fine young fellow be kick'd out of life by a raſcally little feveret! An old woman would have cured him; but ſuch an obſtinate confidence in the ſkill of the renown'd Doctor Feelove! He died full of reſentment, and his laſt words were—"Toſs the Doctor in a blanket."</p>

                  <p>I can forgive that—I can forgive that—but I can't forgive your illiberality, Sir. An old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cure him! It was not in the power of all the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians between London and the Alps to cure him;—not an herb, gum, wood, or fungus in the whole me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicopeia, that could have given him breath two days longer.</p>

(I'm ſure found out to ſay I'm any other;)</l>
               <l>No more Miſs Archer now—the archer's mother!</l>
               <l>Nay, never wonder, doubt, nor ſtart, nor ſtare,</l>
               <l>Don't you perceive the Goddeſs in my air?</l>
               <l>Yon low'ring brow ſays, No—Well!—if you doubt me,</l>
               <l>I'll drop the Goddeſs,—here's enough without me:</l>
               <l>Each ſcarlet Mars above, though e'er ſo dainty,</l>
               <l>May leer around—there's Venus's in plenty;</l>
               <l>Or aim his glaſs beneath, upon the pit,</l>
               <l>He'll ſee his Venus by her Vulcan ſit:</l>
               <l>There Bacchus woos his Venus all divine!</l>
               <l>He nectar aſks—but ſhe—a pint of wine!</l>
               <l>And you can never want the Queen of Love,</l>
               <l>I ſpeak to you, ye roaring Gods above;—</l>
               <l>Momus is ſurely there, from all this racket,</l>
               <l>Yonder he ſits—he's in a ſailor's jacket;</l>
               <l>Thrice happy God, who lives but in a joke!</l>
               <l>His Venus laughs, too—in her hat and cloak.</l>
               <l>Where have I got to?—Lud, how glib my tongue!</l>
               <l>Am I Miſs Archer, Venus, or Miſs Younge?</l>
               <l>Be what I will, among my friends I rank ye,</l>
               <l>Applaud Miſs Archer, and Miſs Younge ſhall thank ye.</l>
