            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY.</head>
            <p>WE read, in the Holy Scriptures, not only of wine that maketh glad the heart of man, but of oil to make his face to ſhine, or his outſide, for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſignifies, and it ought, in this place, Pſalm civ. 15. ſo to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>The ancients accuſtomed themſelves to the outward application of oil, in order to heighten the comelineſs of their perſons—and they did well: for what conſtitutes beauty more than the natural diffuſion of gelatinous juices extracted from the aliment, and brought forward, through the arteries, to all parts of the body? or, if theſe be wanting, what better ſubſtitute can there be than oils properly applied?</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0219200800:5"/>
            <p>This practice of inunction was ſo general, and ſo frequent, that our Saviour gently reproved Simon, the Phariſee, for omitting this inſtance of civility. Luke vii. 46.—The rich and honourable were anointed with oils of the greateſt fragrance.<note n="*" place="bottom">— <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But the ancients uſed oil not only for the decoration and refreſhment of their perſons, but for the preſervation of their health and ſtrength. After bathing, they rubbed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over with ceromata to cloſe the pores of the body,<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </gap>. ANACREON.</note> (Athenaeus lib. xv. cap. 13.) Before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0219200800:6"/>in violent and fatiguing exerciſes, they always uſed ceromata, or medicated oils, to prevent ſtrains, to make their limbs ſupple, and, by hindering tranſpiration, to preclude any great waſte of ſtrength. Now although it muſt be confeſſed that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were not the moſt improved anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, yet their general and frequent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the uſe of ointments and friction was excellent, being very preventative of diſeaſe, and conducive to health, as will appear from the following ſtatement of facts.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. All over the human body are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable inhalants, which are the orifices and branches of the abſorbent veſſels that ultimately terminate in the great veins near the heart. Theſe abſorb and carry fluids <hi>into</hi> the body, but they cannot carry any <hi>out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. There are alſo innumerable exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, which perforate the ſurface of the ſkin, that are the extremities of the arteries, and which carry fluids <hi>out</hi> of the body, but they cannot carry any <hi>in.</hi> According to Sanctorius, the tranſpiration from the ſkin
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0219200800:7"/>far exceeds, in quantity, all the excretions by the other emunctories, and, comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to alvine diſcharges, the proportion is as one to four, ſo that if the ſkin ejects twenty-four, the inteſtines ſhall diſcharge only ſix ounces.<note n="*" place="bottom">If by any means the exhalants be ſo cloſed, as to hinder the greater part of tranſpiration, it muſt be confeſſed that the <hi>deliciae animalis vitae,</hi> that is to ſay, good eating, may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, for a time, unneceſſary; for it appears in ſtory, that wetting the body with ſalt water, prevented hunger in ſix people, who were on a raft in the ſea for ſix days in the Gulph of Mexico; and Captain Bligh of the Bounty experienced the ſame effect after he had been turned adrift, in a boat, by his crew, in the Pacific Ocean.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Animal, or vital heat, which is moſt neceſſary to the nutrition and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the body, is generated by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſition in the lungs of atmoſpheric air by animal gas<note n="†" place="bottom">BOERHAAVE, MARTIN, and others, were of opinion, that the motion of the blood was the <hi>cauſe</hi> of animal heat. If ſo, how is it that the vital heat is nearly the ſame in all perſons in health, although the circulation of the blood be very different? How is it that the vital heat ſhall be the ſame in a young lady, ſitting at her ſampler, as in a ſawyer, in the violent exerciſe of his trade? The circulation ſhall be far above par in one, and below it in the other; but, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the vital heat ſhall be the ſame in both!</note> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Plenck.</note>. And hence it is, that the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0219200800:8"/>more and quicker we inſpire atmoſpheric ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the warmer we become, as in running up hill, or in vehement reading and ſpeaking.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vegetables perſpire from their leaves as animals from their lungs. This vegetable perſpirable matter, when acted upon by the ſun's light, produces the pure part of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpheric, or vital air; hence it is, that exerciſe in a garden, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> is far more ſalubrious than in the ſtreets of a city.</note> That vital heat is generated by the aforeſaid decompoſition in the lungs, appears from conſidering that animals, deſtitute of lungs, are not hotter than the circumambient air, whereas the vital heat of animals poſſeſſed of lungs is by no means dependent on the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the air. In the human body it is hardly ever leſs than 95 degrees, or more than 105 of <hi>Fahrenheit's</hi> tongue thermometer; but if the living body, in a healthy ſtate, be placed in contact to much hotter bodies, it will not acquire their exceſs; nor, if in the midſt of much colder bodies, will it acquire their coldneſs; thus, on the coaſt of Africa, where the heat of the climate ſhall riſe to 140 degrees of <hi>Fahrenheit's</hi> thermometer, the human body will retain its natural heat of 96 degrees, becauſe of the evaporation of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0219200800:9"/>ſweat which generates coldneſs; hence it is, that the negroes in the Weſt India Iſlands endure labour in the ſun far better than white men, becauſe, as it is ſaid, of their quicker evaporation of perſpirable matter from their ſkin and lungs. So again in the frozen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the North, the heat of the living body ſhall experience no material change; and this is providential, for if the living body had not the means to reſiſt exceſſive heat,<note n="*" place="bottom">The heat of the room in which Dr. Blagden, and others, entered, was raiſed, whilft they were in it, to 240<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, and to 260<hi rend="sup">o</hi>; theſe exceſſive heats were borne for a conſiderable time, with little inconvenience, by the gentlemen who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to them, both naked and with their clothes on; nor was the <hi>heat</hi> of Dr. Blagden's body at all <hi>increaſed,</hi> though the velocity of his pulſe was, in one inſtance, more than doubled. A blaſt of the heated air from a pair of bellows was ſearcely to be endured, for the following obvious reaſon: When the ſame air remained for any time in contact with the body, part of its heat was deſtroyed, and, conſequently, the body was ſurrounded with a colder medium than the air of the room; whereas, when freſh portions of the air were applied to the body in ſuch a quick ſucceſſion that no part of it could remain in contact a ſufficient time to be cooled, the heat was ſeaſibly greater.
<p>
                     <hi>Vide</hi> CHAMBERS'S Dictionary, under the article HEAT.</p>
               </note> the fluids would become too thin, run out, or putrify; and if it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0219200800:10"/>exceſſive cold, the fluids of the body could not circulate, and, of courſe, become coagulant.</p>
            <p>This vital heat is the cauſe of that ſtrong inteſtine action by which the ſolids of the body are expanded, the fluids broke down and divided, and ſuperfluous and heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous matter ſeparated and diſcharged. When it is ſufficiently ſtrong, in a healthy ſtate,<note n="*" place="bottom">This vital heat may be in exceſs, as in hectic and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory fevers, acute rheumatiſm, &amp;c. <hi>Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi>—Is not vitiated air, in jails, when combined with animal gas, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of patrid miaſma?</note> it forces the blood and juices into the extreme arteries, the ſkin becomes ſoft and glowing, and the fleſh turgeſcent from that bland oleaginous aliment ſo well, and ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally diffuſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Friction, although far leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative and reſtorative than bodily exerciſe in the open country air, eſpecially if uſed to the point of fatigue, yet, in one particular, it is more ſerviceable, becauſe of its topical application.</p>
            <p>Friction, by obliging the veins to admit of diſtenſion, cauſes the arterial blood more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0219200800:11"/>abundantly to flow into them, hereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the velocity of the circulation, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the vital heat, and augmenting vigour; moreover, the venal blood, by means of friction, runs quicker towards the heart, which it ſtimulates to a greater propulſion of the blood and juices over the whole body.</p>
            <p>If cold coagulated blood be rubbed, in a glaſs mortar, it will again become a frothy liquid of a crimſon colour. It is ſaid, indeed, that this effect ariſes from freſh ſurfaces of blood being expoſed to the atmoſpheric air, with the oxygen, of which it immediately combines, reſtoring it to the ſame floridity as when in the body; nevertheleſs, it is alſo true, that gentle friction ſo attenuates ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant blood, in bruiſes, that it will enter into the mouths of the bibulous veins.</p>
            <p>Friction moves and attenuates the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe immeable juices in the veſſels that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber and relax the nervous ſyſtem; but if vehemently and immoderately uſed it excites inflammation, and, by too much, encreaſing the contraction of the heat and arteries, the liquids exhale, and the body becomes parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dry. Immoderate labour, in like
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0219200800:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>manner, is prejudicial to the health, and it prevents longevity, for hard-working people ſoon look old; and it is obſervable, that women, in general, live longer than men.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Oil, whether contained in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lular membrane of the body, or externally applied, greatly, by its lubricity, facilitates muſcular motion. It keeps off the coldneſs of the atmoſphere; hence, fat perſons are not ſo ſuſceptible of cold as lean people, and it is the beſt preventive againſt chilblains. It gives whiteneſs to the tender ſkin; hence it is, that the fatteſt parts of the body are the whiteſt, as the breaſts of young women.—It gives roundneſs and beauty to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man form; for the ſkin, when not diſtended by it, contracts itſelf into unſightly wrinkles. It gives nouriſhment to the body, for being abſorbed by the inhalants, it is carried, with the chyle, into the blood. If it be ſaid that oil, externally applied, ſtops the excretory pores, thereby preventing ſweat and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible perſpiration, I anſwer, from my own experience, that it does not, but it rather promotes both, eſpecially if applied by briſk friction, for it cleanſes the exhalants of that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0219200800:13"/>ever encruſting luting ſordes, which covers even the moſt delicate perſons, and which the vapour bath ſoon diſcovers to every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual.<note n="*" place="bottom">The cuticle, or upper ſkin, by time, wears rough, and decays, and a new one is generated; hence it is, that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penes and ſhell-fiſh, every ſummer, become new coated. Vegetables and trees ſeem to have this property, according to the ingenious Mr. FORSYTH's experiments on this curious ſubject.</note> The ancients, who were in the frequent practice of inunction, never found plain oil to ſtop the pores; for when they wiſhed to ſtop or hinder tranſpiration, they uſed wax with their oil; ſuch were the precious ceromata, mentioned by Athenaeus, (Deipnoſoph 5.) as of ſaffron, ſweet mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram, fenugreek, flower-de-luce, and of roſes; and not thinking even theſe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſufficiently obſtructive of the pores, they, before engaging in gymnaſtic exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and after anointing themſelves with oil, rolled themſelves in the ſand.</p>
            <p>From what I have written concerning the inhalants, the exhalants, vital heat, friction and oil, I think, that the following practice will be thought, by the public, reaſonable, uſeful and important.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0219200800:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>In incipient dropſy, particularly the leuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmatic, and anaſarcous (ariſing from the debility of the vaſcular ſyſtem), the chief cure is to ſtrengthen the veſſels by friction, and a ſtimulating oil; ſo that the abſorbents ſhall take up the water from the cavities, and the perſpiratory powers recover their wonted action. That the dropſy does not ariſe, as is commonly imagined, from an atony, or laxity of the whole body, and the viſcera thereof, appears from this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that many cachectic perſons are not dropſical, and many who have ciſted dropſy, are entirely free from any cachexy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>In chronic rheumatiſm, owing to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous colluvies of humours predominant about the moving fibres of the muſcles; as alſo in ſtiffneſs, and rigidity of the joints and muſcles, particularly in old military men, ariſing from frequent and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures to the injuries of the weather, and from old healed-up wounds and fractures; medicated oils, with a fleſh-bruſh, together with electrical ſhocks on the ſtiffened parts, will be found very ſerviceable.</p>

            <p>The fibres of old people are hard and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, their perſpiration is little, and that bland vapour which formerly bedewed their bodies is no more; inunction, with friction to them, is moſt ſalutary, for the animal warmth and juices are hereby drawn into the ſkin, and the oil, by its nouriſhing powers, renovates and invigorates the whole ſyſtem. The ſagacious Sydenham had great ſucceſs in the recovery of debilitated nature, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending healthy young men as bedfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to the aged and infirm; he ſaid, that heat alone was not the cauſe of reſtoration, for the application of warm napkins did no good, (ſec. i. cap. iv. p. 79.) it was therefore only to be aſcribed to the mild oleaginous effluvia. Now, if the human oleaginous effluvia be ſo penetrating and balſamic as to afford revivifying nouriſhment by abſorp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why ſhould not the oil of ſweet-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, for inſtance, do the ſame thing, eſpecially when broke down and preſſed in, by heat and friction.</p>
            <p>Soldiers that are expoſed to exceſſive heats in hot countries, ſhould frequently be ordered to rub their bodies with ceromata, to prevent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0219200800:16"/>too great a waſte of ſtrength by perſpiration; and when in cold countries, they are expoſed to rain, and ſleep in damp camps, they ſhould be enjoined to follow the practice of inunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for being generally young men, ſuch ſtimuli would quickly arouſe their native heat, draw it to the ſurface, and keep it there, and alſo, by cloſing the inhalants, effectually ſhut out an otherwiſe too pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating a humidity.</p>
            <p>After hard labour, or exceſſive fatigue, the outward uſe of oil is wonderfully reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and refreſhing: this is not only teſtified by the practice of the ancient Athletae, but by ſome mowers at Hendon, this ſummer, who, before the application, were nearly exhauſted by exceſſive labour at taſk work, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards followed it up with eaſe and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>After warm bathing in the winter ſeaſon, the application of a ceroma is very adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for by rendering the inhalants imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the cold air, colds are prevented, and, by cloſing the orifices of exhalants, the dewy, nutritious juice, and vital heat (drawn towards the ſkin by the bath) is then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0219200800:17"/>which muſt greatly warm and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>An imperfect paralyſis in the aged, not only ariſes from a deficiency of vigour, and a relaxation of nerves, ſtrained and worn by various deſtroying cauſes, as gluttony, ebriety, &amp;c. but often it is owing to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineneſs of the vital principle, or the Anima-Medica,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the curious and elegant oration of the late learned Dr. Nicholls, (Phyſician to George the IId.) on the Powers of the Anima Medica, before the College of Phyſicians in London.</note> for terror, or imminent danger, has often been the means of reſtoring thoſe limbs (during the paroxyſm of fear) that were before uſeleſs. Here then it ſeems, that impotency is not the cauſe, but ſloth; ſurely then the natural and beſt cure muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from exerciſe, friction, and ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oil.</p>
            <p>Chilly, ſedentary perſons who ill endure the winter's cold, ſhould frequently uſe friction, and a ſtimulating oil, for it is, through debility from want of exertion, that the arteries do not propel the fluids with ſuch force as would prove ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the exhalants in the ſkin.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0219200800:18"/>
            <p>A nervous unhappineſs, with ſuſceptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of cold is often occaſioned by a thick cacochymy of humours, not at all inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory; in this caſe, after proper evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is proper to draw the juices to the ſurface of the body by light frictions with the aromata, ſo indeed as to promote the due circulation of the blood, but not by violent application, to encumber the heart and lungs by the reflux of theſe thick and foul hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. The mind of man may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered figuratively as the axle-tree, round which the wheel of life can beſt turn, for although it may be unconſcious of its power, yet it works wonders on the ſolids and fluids of the body, rectifying their irregularity, and reducing them to moderation, or elſe rendering them inordinate and deſtructive. But if the mind have power over the body, ſo alſo has the body a wonder-working power over the mind, for it is the blood that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the <hi>temperament</hi> of different perſons. The red part abounds in the <hi>ſanguineous,</hi> whoſe veins are large and cerulean, the head thin of hair, the fleſh ſoft and abundant, and the cheeks of a roſy colour. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0219200800:19"/>of this temperament are fond of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they are ſoon but not long angry, eaſily perſuaded and inconſtant.</p>
            <p>The albumenous part of the blood abounds in the petuitous, whoſe veins are ſmall and almoſt imperceptible; the face pale, the fleſh abundant, but cold and flaccid. The mind is uſually placid and ſerene, regardful of deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, and of the honeſtum, and of what it ought to do, but generally too lazy to exert its powers.</p>
            <p>When the blood is too concrete, having loſt its proper fluidity, it forms the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholic temperament. The fleſh and hair are of a very dark colour, as among the Jews, (who are commonly of this temperament) the head frequently bald. The body is very lean and dry, the blood veſſels denſe and thin. The mind is conſtant to its purpoſe, not haſty, mindful of injuries, and remarkable for earneſtneſs in thinking.</p>
            <p>From theſe temperaments are made up the reſt, as the bilious, where the body is thin, the colour brown, the hair black, criſp and buſhy, the veins large, the mind intelligent and reſolute.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0219200800:20"/>
            <p>The phlegmatic are cold, not hairy, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to baldneſs, fat and unweildly, liable to tumours, the mind ſometimes timid, generally inoffenſive. The warm temperament is in body agile and robuſt, well covered with yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, thick, and copious pile, as the head with hair; the angles of the eyes, and alſo the face and lips are of a very red colour, the pulſe full and frequent, the mind capable, but impetuous.</p>
            <p>But nevertheleſs, to vindicate the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the mind over the body, it is to be obſerved that, by the medicinal and dietetic art, one temperament may be altered, in ſome degree into another, ſo that the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous may become ſanguineous, the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous melancholic <hi>et vice verſa.</hi> St. Paul ſaith, <q>"I keep my body under, and bring it into ſubjection: leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myſelf ſhould be a caſt away." <bibl>1 Cor. ix. 27.</bibl>
               </q> Undoubtedly the mind can, and often does reduce the body to reaſon, by the means of diet and the forbearing virtues; hence the uſe of faſting and religious meditation: but here obſerve, that what would ſtimulate one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0219200800:21"/>perſon, ſay of a hot temperament, into paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, might only lift up another who is pitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous into reaſonable comfort.</p>
            <p>Phlegmatic perſons of irritable habits of body (whoſe circulation is weak, the blood not being ſent in ſufficient force to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, ſo as in a due degree, to promote per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and who by their inhalants, abſorb more moiſture from the atmoſphere than ſtronger people), ſhould perſeveringly uſe friction, if not oil; they ſhould alſo pay particular attention to diet. They ſhould avoid ſugar and butter, which, by thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the juices, impedes the circulation. Inſtead of eating glary food, as pig-meat and fatted calf, they ſhould be contented with a more drying and attenuating diet, which would prevent alarming portions of lymph from collecting in the lungs, or in the joints. True indeed it is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a perſon be charged with too much lymph he may continue in health, but how long theſe defluxions may remain benign and unhurtful, no one can ſay, for alſo true it is, that, by the adverſe diameters of a very few veſſels, the juices may ſoon become
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0219200800:22"/>ſtagnant and banefully acrimonious. The too abundant lymph ſhould be diſcharged by draſtic purges, at long intervals, and for diet, ſuch as ſtrengthens the elaſticity of the fibres, ſhould be recommended. Roaſt meat<note n="*" place="bottom">Roaſting, except the little that flies off by vapour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrates the juices of the meat within it, giving the meat an empyreumatic and ſtimulating flavour; whereas, boiling diſcharges the gelatinous part and eſſential oil of the meat into the water, rendering it inſapid; therefore, it will not. I believe, be too much to ſay, that half a pound of roaſt will afford as much nouriſhment with a greater ſtimulus, as three quarters of a pound of boiled meat; moreover, the organs of digeſtion require fibrous matter to work upon, as will appear from the following experiment, which, I heard, was tried by an eminent ſurgeon in London: He confined one large dog to the broth of meat boiled down, as we ſay, to rags, and another large dog to the ragged meat ſo boiled down, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, I ſuppoſe, a little water to quench his thirſt. The dog that drank the broth ſoon became emaciated, and died; but he that eat the fibres of the meat remained in health, and grew fat.
<p>The old French way of dreſſing meat with little or no water, but with a few vegetables, as potatoes, in a pan ſo cloſely covered or luted, as to confine all the vapour or eſſential oil within, is, <hi>me judice,</hi> the moſt palatable, and the beſt mode of cookery.</p>
               </note> and game are proper; fruits, if any, ſhould be ſomewhat auſtere, and alſo the wine; ſay good rough port, but ever let this dietetic rule be carefully obſerved, <hi>"ne quid nemis."</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0219200800:23"/>
            <p>Wine, if medically taken, augments the ſtrength of the animal fibres and rarifies the juices of the body; but if immoderately drank, it excites a univerſal ſpaſm that ends in weakneſs and relaxation, as the trembling hands and ſtaggering gate of bacchanalians ſufficiently evince. Wine after much uſe loſes its ſtimulating power; hence it is that hard-drinkers proceed from bad to worſe, from wine to the drinking of pure ſpirit; thus deſtroying their health, their reputation, and their life, for a very tranſient and miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſatisfaction.<note n="*" place="bottom">In general debility brought on by drinking ſpirituous liquors, with loſs of appetite, it is, firſt, adviſable for the patient to leave off drinking one fourth of his uſual quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: if, in a fortnight, his appetite ſomewhat returns, let him leave off another fourth part, and ſo every fortnight continue the decreaſe, 'till the burning potation be totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for a daily, but ſmall quantity of red port wine. If indeed, the natural powers of digeſtion be quite deſtroyed, by the means of ſpirituous liquors, then there is but little hope of reſtoration.</note> But wine, if mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately taken, enables the veſſels of the body with encreaſed alacrity to take up and diſperſe nouriſhment over the ſyſtem. It is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe after fatigue; alſo in the cure of mental languors, and in urgent fears, for it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0219200800:24"/>not only braces the fibres, but it tonifies the mind; and therefore it is that ſoldiers and ſailors after a dram of ſpirituous liquor, deſpiſe danger, and joyouſly enter into a battle.</p>
            <p>Again, pituitous perſons who uſe but little exerciſe, are particularly ſuſceptible of the ill effects of a damp air, which although, by the thermometer, may not be colder than a dry one, is more penetrating becauſe <hi>it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts</hi> better, filling the inhalants with crude noxious vapour; hence ſwellings of the great joints of the limbs are frequent, which are miſtaken for the gout. Certainly the beſt preſervatives are ſtrong daily exerciſe to the point of fatigue, ſo as to ſweat; a dry cardiac diet; frequent friction with ceromata of eſſential oil, to counteract the baneful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the atmoſphere; and ſuch cloathing as of wool cloſe to the ſkin, which, being a bad conductor, will prevent the inhalants from improper abſorption.<note n="*" place="bottom">By warm cloathing, we may indeed avoid in part, a cold humidity, but if we would do ſo entirely, the face and the hands muſt be alſo cloathed; whereas, by counteracting the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the air by ſtimulants and eſſential oils, every good effect will be anſwered, without acquiring the bad habit of too warm cloathing.</note>
            </p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0219200800:25"/>
            <p>It is alſo not uncommon for ſuch perſons to be troubled with an aqueous, not a chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous, diabetes, for by checked exhalation, what is not diſcharged by perſpiration and ſweat, paſſes through the bladder; and their too copious abſorption of circumambient fluids doubtleſs encreaſes the quantity of urine.<note n="*" place="bottom">Perſpiratio ad urinam in aeſtate eſt in ratione, 5. 3; in hyeme vero ut, 2. 3.</note> This very common, and too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, yet dangerous diſeaſe, may, I think, be abated if not entirely cured, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing practice: — If it ariſe from hectic fever, mucilages (perhaps with acids to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the hectic) are ſerviceable; but if from hyſteric, or any tranſitory relaxing cauſes, mucilages and diffuſible ſtimuli are more proper. In either caſe the <hi>primae viae</hi> ſhould be cleanſed firſt by ipecacuanha, then by rhubarb; ſtrengtheners, and mild aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents ſhould be uſed; a dry binding diet, and morning and evening friction in a warm room, with a defenſive oil againſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0219200800:26"/>damp weather,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cold gives additional ſtrength to perſons already ſtrong in health, becauſe of the re-action of the vital power, and becauſe the air may be nearly uncharged with vapour, and therefore more of it, in a given time, is inhaled; but cold debilitates very weak and ſedentary people, becauſe of the want of re-action. Damp and cold air, or damp and hot air, is hurtful to all perſons, becauſe leſs pure air, and too much humidity is inhaled by the ſkin and lungs. Certainly the healthieſt is the warm and dry atmoſphere, which ought to be a conſideration of ſome weight to valetudinarians who can afford either to change their reſidence, or to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</note> ſhould be earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
            <p>Sometimes cold and damp air ſhall ſo relax the nervous ſyſtem, as to deprive the patient of the uſe of his limbs; then a briſk vomit and the application, by friction, of warm medicated oil on the back bone, or on the inert limbs, will be of great ſervice.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe of children, called the rickets, after diſcharging the redundant lymph by vomits and detergent doſes of rhubarb, is to be cured by friction, and with woollen cloths properly fumigated.</p>
            <p>It is not uncommon to ſee, in young ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary people, the ſkin diſcoloured, the muſcles lank, the face pale and variouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0219200800:27"/>with puſtules; the ſpirits gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a low ſtate, and the body ſluggiſh. The cure is to excite the perſpiratory powers by bodily labour, friction, roaſt meat, and wine; and to heal the face by lenient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious liniment.</p>
            <p>Old ſtrains, and ſtubborn pains in the back, loins, and elſewhere, are, for the moſt part, curable by friction and medicated oil, and even incipient white ſwellings, that would otherwiſe cripple or render the limb uſeleſs, are thus to be diſperſed and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Dry white ſcaly eruptions on the elbows and knees, even of long ſtanding, may be cured by friction and medicated oil;<note n="*" place="bottom">When, through neglect, the hair of the head in children becomes matted and ſtuck together, by a viſcid humour that the exhalants caſt upon the ſkin, the ſafeſt and ſpeedieſt cure, after cutting off the hair, is, daily to ſpunge the head with hot water, always taking care, after ſpunging, to dry the head well with hot cloths.</note> and here I muſt remark, that although the cure of the ſea ſcurvy may be obtained by the vegetable acid of oranges and lemons, yet I ſubmit to the conſideration of the ſurgeons of the navy, whether or not, rubbing the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0219200800:28"/>oil of the rinds on the diſeaſed parts, would not accelerate the cure.</p>
            <p>After fevers, and ſome chronical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, the hair of the head falls off, either becauſe the ſkin ſhrinks and becomes dry, through want of nutritious juices, or becauſe through diſeaſed relaxation, the ſtabulum of the hair becomes too weak. In the firſt caſe, baldneſs may be cured by oily liniments. In the ſecond, good ſtrengtheners of the ſyſtem will be found moſt uſeful.</p>
            <p>If this publication ſhould ſerve as a hint to a more enlarged mode of medical practice than the preſent, I ſhall, as a Clergyman of the Church of England, moſt heartily rejoice as having been the humble means of doing ſome good to my fellow-creatures.</p>
            <p>It may be neceſſary here to obſerve, that I had been ſeven years in holy orders, before I became doctor of phyſic, at Leyden, never thinking it at all improper to blend two very uſeful profeſſions together, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as our bleſſed Lord himſelf healed the diſeaſes of the body as well as of the ſoul.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0219200800:29"/>
            <p>Indeed, I am ſtrongly of opinion, as I have elſewhere obſerved in my Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic Monitor, that the public and private good reſulting from ſuch a union of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, would be great and incalculable. The unbeneficed clergy (being phyſicians) would enlarge the ſphere of their uſefulneſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt the poor people, and by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting moderate fees<note n="*" place="bottom">A viſit near the practitioner's reſidence might be rated at half-a-guinea. If two miles off, one guinea, and ſo on, <hi>in modo.</hi> Journeys in the night, and in bad weather, when car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages muſt be hired, deſerve a larger conſideration.</note> from the yeomanry and gentry, they would ſoon diſentangle themſelves from that poverty and diſtreſs, which is as ſubverſive of their reſpectabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in civilized life, as of their deſerved comfort.</p>
            <p>To the public at large, the advantages would be very great, having able prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners always near at hand, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enormous expence of cure ſo properly cut down as to exclude none from the benefit of good medical advice.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0219200800:30"/>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the clergy would not be ſo competent in the healing art as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, I will aſk why not? They have the ſame advantages of learning at Oxford and Cambridge, where there are hoſpitals, as other medical ſtudents, and if degrees in phyſic are thought to be particularly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable from Oxford and Cambridge, ſurely the competency ought not to be diſputed. By this union of profeſſions in the clergy, as phyſicians, no injury would be done to ſurgeons, apothecaries, and chymiſts, nor no injuſtice to phyſicians of eſtabliſhed fame and practice; for, if ſucceſsful, they would ſtill retain their patients, and even encreaſe the number, though, poſſibly, they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive fees more ſuitable to their reſpective merit.</p>
