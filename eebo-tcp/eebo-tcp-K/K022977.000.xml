            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF we will look a little into the Conduct and Cuſtom of the World, it may not appear ſo extraordinary as ſome have thought it, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> becauſe he cannot be the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Honour</hi> to Mankind, ſhould be fond of uſurping the <hi>Fountain of Infamy,</hi> and pleaſe himſelf with dealing out a Fund of <hi>dirty</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions from that <hi>inexhauſtible</hi> Spring. And as nothing yields a more ſincere Delight than to ſee the Workings of a <hi>beneficent</hi> Mind; I doubt not but every <hi>good</hi> Man is rejoiced to obſerve this <hi>Great Prince</hi> creating <hi>Dunces</hi> upon <hi>Dunces,</hi> of his own free Will and Motion, with ſo much Alacrity, and all in a due Subordination. It is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0136400800:34"/> certain, I ought to be very well ſatisfied with my Share of <hi>Honours</hi> in this Kingdom of <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſince the Preamble to my Patent is, That <hi>He could not find One more fit to wear them.</hi> I would not willingly act like the Favourite, whom <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> ſomewhere deſcribes, who being made proud by his Prince, advanced his Pride againſt the Power that bred it: But I would rather, like a grateful Favourite, lay out my Talents in aſſerting the Legality of my Maſter's Title to thoſe Dominions, in which he exerciſes ſo free a Sway, and from whence he ſo unſparingly diſpenſes his <hi>Promotions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince I have mention'd <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> (one of the Tributaries by Conqueſt made ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his Throne) I will attempt to convince Unbelievers, by ſome few Inſtances of his <hi>Proweſs,</hi> with what a Strength of Arm, and Fineneſs of Head, he has <hi>humbled</hi> that proud Adverſary to his Sceptre; Or, (to ſtep out of all <hi>Metaphor</hi> at once) I will attempt to ſhew with what Fidelity he has perform'd the <hi>dull</hi> Office of an <hi>Editor,</hi> hardly without aiming to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Author himſelf, or having any Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his Readers ever ſhould: Or, where he does aim, to ſhew he has ſuch a happy Fatality at Miſtaking, that we are to wiſh he would not explain the Author into <hi>Nonſenſe.</hi> Give me Leave to ſubjoin ſome Examples juſt as they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to my Obſervation.</p>

            <p>I had deſign'd to throw in another Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Word <hi>Caſtle;</hi> but I have already tranſgreſs'd the Limits of a Letter, and there are two, or three, Topicks ſtill behind, that I have an Occaſion to touch upon.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s DUNCIAD having lately made its Appearance in ſo pompous a Shape, with <hi>Notes variorum,</hi> (I am ſorry the Editor could not ſpare us this ſhort Scrap in a <hi>ſingle</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;) I am very well content to paſs over the <hi>Slander</hi> of his <hi>Wit;</hi> but ought not, as I apprehend, to reſt Silent under <hi>that</hi> of his <hi>Malice,</hi> in which he would fix a pretended Charge of Ingratitude upon Me, a Vice, I hope, of all others the leaſt ingraſted in my Nature. This Charge is, <q>That during the Space of two Years, while Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> was preparing his Edition of <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> I, who had then ſome Correſpondence with him, and was ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting Favours by Letters, did wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0136400800:42"/> my Deſign (upon that Author) till after his Publication.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To one Part of this Accuſation I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in a former Letter in this <hi>Paper.</hi> To ſay I concealed my Deſign, is a ſlight Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: for I had no ſuch certain Deſign, till I ſaw how <hi>incorrect</hi> an Edition Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Publick. To the other Part, I think, I dare ſecurely charge my Memory with all the <hi>Favours</hi> that ever I ventur'd to ask of Mr. <hi>Pope:</hi> and I challenge him to produce my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt me, if he thinks there is any Room for it. The firſt Favour that I ask'd, was, when I introduced a Play upon the Stage, that he would aſſiſt me in a few Tickets towards my Benefit. In about a Month after this Requeſt, I received my Packet back, with this civil Excuſe, That he had been all the while from home, and had not my Parcel till it was too late to do any thing with it. This, I confeſs, induced me, when I put out my Propoſals for <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> to ſollicit Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> for this <hi>Second Favour,</hi> that he would pleaſe to recommend <hi>that</hi> my <hi>Deſign,</hi> if it did not interfere with his own Affair of the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> reply'd by Letter, <q>That <hi>he was glad I had undertaken this Work, and ſhould be as glad to promote my Intereſt, notwithſtanding his own Subſcription to the</hi> Odyſſey: <hi>That his own Awkwardneſs, and indeed Inability, of ſolliciting in any Kind, made him quite uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0136400800:43"/> to his own Intereſt; but that he might not be intirely ſo to mine, he would ask thoſe of his Friends for me, with whom he was familiar enough to ask any thing.</hi>
               </q>—But from that Day to the Publication of my <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare Reſtored,</hi> (an Interval of above Two Years) I never received one Line more from Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> no Intimation of <hi>one</hi> Subſcriber by his Intereſt, not even an Order that I ſhould put his <hi>own</hi> Name down in my Liſt. Upon this naked Fact, I ſubmit the Cenſure both of my <hi>Obligations</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Publick</hi> ſhould not have been troubled with this State of the Caſe, had not theſe Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations been induſtriouſly propagated at this Criſis, both to hurt my Intereſt in my <hi>Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for my <hi>Remarks on</hi> SHAKESPEARE, which will now ſhortly appear in the World; and in that <hi>Play,</hi> which is deſigned for my <hi>Benefit</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> next in the Theatre at <hi>Drury Lane.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Double Falſhood.</note> It is my Misfortune, I can boaſt but of a very ſcanty Intereſt, and much leſs Merit; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, Both are the more eaſily to be ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
