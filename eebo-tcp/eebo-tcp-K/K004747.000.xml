            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE intention of the following ſheets is to direct a right uſe of thoſe medicines which are neceſſary to be kept in families, whoſe diſtance from a good practitioner, or any other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, renders an immediate application in ſudden illneſſes almoſt impoſſible, and occaſions thoſe delays in trifling complaints, which oftentimes prove of very bad conſequence. It has been found by experience, for want of proper hints and directions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the doſes of medicines, ſeveral fatal errors have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, either from the ignorance of perſons themſelves, or from being obliged to have recourſe, for want of better, to the advice of nurſes, and ſuch good women, whoſe greateſt ſkill extends to the making a poſſet for a ſweat, or a plaſter for a ſore ſhin.</p>
            <p>THOSE captains of ſhips whoſe veſſels are too ſmall to allow of carrying a ſurgeon, and gentlemen whoſe buſineſs may call them to take a long voyage in ſuch ſmall veſſels, or to travel by land through unfrequented or poor places, or thoſe who are going to ſettle in any of his Majeſty's plantations, will find a great advantage from being thus enabled to become their own phyſicians in caſes of neceſſity; and we often ſee that Nature, with a little aſſiſtance, will free the conſtitution from diſorders which are not too deeply rooted, or very malignant in the firſt attack. I would by no means be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to pretend that the medicines I here recommend, are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in the reſpective diſorders they are preſcribed for, being for the moſt part ſuch only as are to be found in the diſpenſatory of the college of phyſicians; where I have been under a neceſſity of compounding, I have attended to the practice of the principal phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians in town, and aſſume no further merit to myſelf than to care of ſelecting ſuch medicines whoſe operations are the leaſt dangerous. Thus far however I will venture to aſſert, that, by following theſe directions, which are plain and eaſy, and wrote in a ſtile fitted to the meaneſt capacity, perſpicuity being always preferable to elegance in this kind of writing, the patient may, by
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0307600400:4"/>applying what is neceſſary in time, prevent thoſe ills that follow from neglect, which good nurſing and a few innocent things might at firſt remove.</p>
            <p>THOSE who have a knowledge in phyſic, and do not ſtand in need of my aſſiſtance, will in the boxes find many uſeful medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to be kept at hand, and may extend their practice, by giving me a catalogue of ſuch others as they would chuſe to have added.</p>
            <p>LADIES and gentlemen, who reſide in the country, will hereby be enabled to aſſiſt their poor neighbours; which many of them I doubt not would take a pleaſure in doing, did they but know what to apply.</p>
            <p>WITH each box of medicines may be had a box of ſcales and weights; each weight marked diſtinctly, that any perſon may at once adjuſt the proper quantity for a doſe.</p>
            <p>As many people may chuſe to keep by them what is proper for their own particular complaints, whom it may not ſuit to have the box complete, I think it neceſſary to mention, that any of the medicines here recommended may be had ſeparate, or as many of them as agreeable, packed up in leſſer boxes for the conveniency of carriage.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS tincture is of uſe in a difficulty of breathing, tightneſs acroſs the breaſt, and ſhort coughs, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly if brought on by cold north-eaſterly winds, which frequently affect the breaſt, ſides, and lungs: it allays the cough, opens the cheſt, and looſens the phlegm, ſo that it eaſily comes away; and frees the pores of the ſkin which have been ſhut up by the winds.</p>
               <p>It may be taken as often as occaſion requires, from thirty to ſixty or eighty drops, in a little<note n="*" place="bottom">See Page 15.</note> pectoral drink or barley water, with which you ſhould dilute plentifully, drinking it of the ſame heat as you would a diſh of tea.</p>

               <head>ASTRINGENT ELECTARY.</head>
               <p>NEVER be too haſty in the uſe of this electary; it is often found that a purging is the means made uſe of by Nature to carry off other complaints, or to free the body from bad humours, which might in time beget diſorders; now, by ſtopping this wholeſome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0307600400:6"/>drain too ſoon, theſe bad humours may be thrown back into the blood, and produce the worſt conſequences: therefore you will ſeldom or never err, by ſuffering the purging, if not over violent, to continue two or three days, at the end of that time, ſhould you find the patient weakened by it, or that it is really a diſorder it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not a cure for other diſorders, then you may give a doſe or two of rhubarb, and afterwards proceed to the uſe of the electa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: by theſe means you will cleanſe the ſtomach and bowels, and get rid of the complaint without any farther trouble.</p>
               <p>Fluxes, which ſeafaring people are ſubject to, are to be treated much in the ſame manner, but be very careful to cleanſe the bowels firſt.</p>
               <p>Some of my friends who have been many years accuſtomed to the ſea, recommend the<note n="*" place="bottom">See p. 17.</note> purging apozem before the uſe of aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents: they ſay it cools the body, and carries off every thing which is diſagreeable to the bowels, better than rhubarb, or any other purge. After having cleanſed the ſtomach and bowels of the filth which occaſioned the diſorder, by the one or other of theſe means, you will find ipecacuanha given with the aſtringent electary in very ſmall quantities, viz. from half a grain to one or two grains, of infinite ſervice; but this ſhould be practiſed only by thoſe who have ſome little knowledge in phyſic, and they will have the ſatisfaction to find the method here recommended will ſeldom, if ever, fail of ſucceſs.</p>

               <p>The fit being put by, a ſecond ounce ſhould be taken in the like ſmall doſes within the three following days, at the diſtance of about ſix or eight hours; the patient may now reſt ſix days, unleſs ſigns of the ague's return require the bark to be repeated ſooner, when a third ounce is to be taken in like manner, a doſe every ſix or eight hours; another week being elapſed, a fourth ounce is alſo to be adminiſtered, when you may take your leave of them, and be pretty well aſſured they will not be ſubject to a return.</p>
               <p>The common mixture to give it in may be made of three quarters of a pint of ſpring water, and a quarter of a pint of good French brandy, ſweetened with a bit of ſugar, a teacupful of which ſhould be taken with each doſe; mix the powder in a little of it, and drink the remainder after it.</p>
               <p>If it purges, which is oftentimes the caſe, it ſhould be given in a little cinnamon tea; ſhould that not anſwer, two, three, or four drops of laudanum muſt be added to each doſe.</p>

               <p>Is of late years brought into much eſteem in England; it is of a reſtorative and ſtrengthening quality<note n="*" place="bottom">Salop, like moſt other things for which there is a large demand, to enable the trader to ſell cheap, is very frequently much adulterated. I am afraid the greateſt part of what is commonly ſold for powder of ſalop, will be found to have in it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of ſtarch and gum arabic, which ought to put people upon their guard where they purchaſe it; for, although the virtues of the true are undeniable, the adulterated muſt fall ſhort of its excellency, and the falſe in appearance, if art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully managed, will deceive very good judges.</note>; many ladies, whom I have had the honour to recommend it to, of tender conſtitutions, where tea has been found to prey over-much upon a week ſtomach and where more nouriſhment has been neceſſary than they received from their ordinary food, eat it in a morning for breakfaſt; and I muſt confeſs it would much pleaſe me to ſee it more univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, particularly by thoſe who are ſubject to nervous complaints, being in its own nature very ſtrengthening, eaſy of digeſtion, and, in the manner here recommended, affords a great deal of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an impoveriſhed ſtate of blood; therefore the propereſt food that can be received after a ſevere fit of ſickneſs, whereby the patint is much weakened.</p>
               <p>The common way of preparing it is with water, and a glaſs of wine added to it, but the method I think far preferable is this:</p>
               <p>Boil half a pint of milk with as much water, while it is in a boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, let two tea-ſpoonfuls of the powder of ſalop, firſt mixed in a baſon with a ſpoonful or two of cold water, be thrown into it; after it has ſimmered a minute or two, ſtirring it the while, you will find the whole of a ſmooth creamy conſiſtence; a bit of ſugar, and a little nutmeg may be added to make it palatable. Thoſe whom milk is apt to render coſtive, ſhould mix the ſalop with the water alone as above directed, and add the milk to it after it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the fire.</p>

               <p>IS of late years come into great eſteem in all nervous diſorders; of the bruiſed root they make a tea in the ſame manner as ſena tea, and drink it three or four times a day, which is a proper thing to take the nervous tincture in, being of itſelf I am afraid not effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as the quantity of the root given in this manner, or in the tincture prepared from it, is too trifling to have any great depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon.</p>

               <head>ON BLEEDING.</head>
               <p>IRATHER chuſe to mention the complaints in which bleeding is adviſeable under this general head, than with the medicines for the reſpective diſorders, becauſe it may naturally be ſuppoſed they cannot always procure the aſſiſtance; for which reaſon, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting to bleed before the uſe of the medicines, in caſes where it might prove ſerviceable, may be a means of preventing their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering thoſe remedies, which, taken in time, will frequently alone remove the complaints. Beſides, I would not wiſh the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful to be too free with the lancet, as an injudicious evacuation of blood may be ſucceeded with very bad conſequences; and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention through the whole, as I obſerved in the preface, being no other than to ſupply families with a few uſeful remedies for ſlight indiſpoſitions, by which they may frequently prevent tedious ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but not to put the unexperienced upon trifling with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they are really ill, and can have proper advice.</p>
               <p>Blood ſhould be taken away in the beginning of fevers, when there is a ſtrong, quick pulſe, the eyes red and fiery, with great heat and thirſt; but never when they are in the decline, as, from being inflammatory, they are often at this period degenerated into the nevous kind, when the chief of the affair is to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the frequent application of bliſters.</p>
               <p>In aſthmatical complaints, if the patient be of a full habit of body.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0307600400:33"/>
               <p>In coughs, if the pulſe is quick and full, with an oppreſſion at the breaſt, or difficulty in breathing.</p>
               <p>In colics, where the pain is violent, the bowels inflamed, and no ſtools.</p>
               <p>In fits, if the ſpirits are hurried and overpowered, and the patient full of blood.</p>
               <p>In ſwimmings, dizzineſs, and pains of the head.</p>
               <p>In ſtitches, and pleuritic diſorders of the ſide and breaſt, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly if it gives pain to take a deep breath.</p>
               <p>In ſore throats, where there is a ſtrong, quick pulſe, and the throat greatly ſwelled and inflamed.</p>
               <p>For the piles it is ſometimes ſerviceable; as likewiſe in female obſtructions, and frequently in rheumatic complaints; in apoplec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic diſorders, a dyſentery or bloody flux, and irkſome heat of the bowels; for the hooping cough, particularly if of a full habit of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the phlegm which is brought up appears ſtreaked with blood; in all of which caſes, the quantity taken away muſt be proportioned to the age of the patient, and the violence of the complaint.</p>
               <p>Bleeding again ought to be directed in large abſceſſes or ſwellings, where the heat and pain is immoderate; for in theſe caſes, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood, the matter is more eaſily and ſpeedily brought to ripen, and by that means the body more effectually freed from its diſtempers.</p>
               <p>In a word, wherever prevail ſore eyes, ſciatica or hip gout, a dry huſky cough, an head-ach, pains of the womb or of the bladder, dry gripes, ſtrangury, gravel, pain from the ſtone, violent bleedings of the noſe, ears, or other parts, an inveterate ſcorbutical itch, and the like, opening a vein is of peculiar ſervice; but in dropſies, a jaundice, the gout, and all illneſſes occaſioned by a relaxed ſtate of body, an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed blood, or too great weakneſs of the veſſels, you muſt ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the medicines recommended in this little manual, and not, by an abrupt and prepoſterous uſe of bleeding, increaſe the diſorder, and ruin the health of the patient and your own reputation.</p>

               <head>ON THE APPLICATION OF BLISTERS.</head>
               <p>TO the cautions here laid down with reſpect to bleeding, I ſhall add a word or two concerning the application of bliſters.</p>
               <p>The moſt excellent remedy may be proſtituted by an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, raſh, and fooliſh practice; which, it is plain, oftentimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens with regard to bliſters, by ordering them indiſcriminately in all ſevers, and without diſtinction in any time of the diſtemper, which can only be the effect of ignorance.</p>
               <p>Therefore, before we reſolve on an expedient of this nature, it would be convenient to conſider whether the fever be of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory or nervous kind; if of the former, inſtead of bliſtering the lancet ought to be uſed, and a mild cooling regimen ſet on ſoot, as already directed; this will moderate the heat of the blood, and by degrees reſtore it to its due temper. On the other hand, in fevers of the nervous claſs, where the ſymptoms are quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, the pulſe being low and weak, the ſpirits almoſt ſpent, and the eyes, inſtead of appearing ſparkling, red and fiery, grown quite dim, we ought by all means to make uſe of bliſters, and that freely.</p>
               <p>They are oftentimes proper in paralytic and nervous complaints, as likewiſe in rheumatic pains and pleuriſies, in which caſes a bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter applied immediately upon the part affected frequently affords great relief; and, and in a variety of other caſes they are of infinite
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0307600400:35"/>ſervice; but then regard muſt be paid to the ſtate of the patient's blood, for if a full, quick pulſe, great heat, thirſt, and the other ſymptoms of an inflammatory fever attend upon the diſorders, the fever muſt firſt be conquered, and afterwards, if neceſſity requires it, let bliſters be applied. Should they cauſe a ſtrangury, which will ſometimes be the caſe, give the patient plentifully of marſhmallow drink, or barley water with a little gum arabic diſſolved in it; or if there is a purging, which you would wiſh to be ſtopped, of the hartſhorn drink, and this inconvenience will ſoon be remedied.</p>
               <p>In regard to the management of them, the plaſter ſhould be ſpread upon a piece of an old glove, and bound on to the part intended; after twenty-four hours, the ſtrength of the flies being pretty well ſpent, you may remove the bliſter, and, if you cannot procure the proper dreſſings, a little Turner's cerate ſpread upon a piece of fine rag may ſupply its place.</p>
               <p>Should any bliſters appear unbroke, ſnip them with a pair of ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars; if they give violent pain, this may be done when the plaſter has been applied only twelve hours; when, by diſcharging the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and laying it ſmooth on again, you eaſe the patient, and give the bliſter an opportunity of acting more.</p>
