            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE preſent to Mr. Rich procured me an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to dine with him, which favour I did not accept, but paid my devoirs to him at his morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing levees.—My old maſter, Rich, one day ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Muſter Williamſkin,</hi> you are much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſince I firſt began to <hi>larn</hi> you; I think I muſt engage you.—Name your terms."</q> I then propoſed (on that hint) a plan for ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mber of nights rather than for the ſeaſon:—He inſtantly agreed, and Mr. Foote's Minor was fixed on for immediate preparation; nay, he deigned to deſire me to caſt the parts, I was in ſuch ſudden favour; as he ſaid, with truth, he knew nothing of <hi>Muſter Footy's</hi> farce. Mrs. Rich was a Methodiſt,—not that I mention it as a recommendation, or that ſhe was a better Chriſtian for bowing at the ſhrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of Nonſenſe and Hypocriſy.—Mr. Foote's laſh on Methodiſm at that time was ſeverely felt by that ſect; their compoſition is gloom, melancholy, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and ſpleen; cheerfulneſs is ſeldom obſerved to dawn on their countenances. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their boaſted inſpirations, if Methodiſt preachers had a little reflection, what muſt they think of daring to pronounce every theatre the devil's houſe, and all the players the devil's children! I hope they are joking:—and though it may be joking, I am ſorry to ſay it is wicked. To make a complete actor requires more requiſites to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally excel than almoſt any other profeſſion whatever.</p>
            <p>The amazing powers diſplayed by a Garrick, a Barry, a Mrs. Cibber, and a Siddons, and many others, is evidently the hand of God:—He alone could give the finiſh to ſuch intrinſic merit. And that the Almighty has intended them for that very work is evident; which, if not ſo produced, the world would have loſt ſeeing the higheſt pitch of admiration the human frame can aſpire to. To mention Shakſpeare only, proves more than all the before-mentioned perſons, as he is a hoſt, and ſtands unequalled, as a moral writer, in many points, as well the wonder of the world, as an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal genius.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0593400203:5"/>
I do not wiſh to inſinuate that <hi>every Methodiſt</hi> is an hypocrite, but I mean that I think the greateſt part are really ſo:—So of the preachers, I believe, there are ſome in earneſt, though I fear the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber might be eaſily told. When perſons get to the height of a Whitfield and a Weſley's fame for acting, there is a pride as well as a duty in behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well; and they both laboured hard: but I dare ſay neither of thoſe gentlemen ever refuſed a golden ticket for their ſeparate benefits any more than I ever did?—O yes, <hi>I</hi> actually did <hi>once refuſe five guineas</hi> at York! but I was <hi>modeſt</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it; I expected it to be offered a ſecond time—It was not; what then? Why then I was <hi>diſappointed,</hi> and never will be ſo fooliſh again, if opportunity offers.—Let one of the tabernacle boaſt the ſame—they know better—and that a bird in hand is worth two in the buſh. But, O ye ſaints of your own creating! I will preach to you—Mark! <hi>Judge not of plays and players, leſt</hi> you <hi>be judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who are the moſt cenſorious on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of others, are uſually moſt notoriouſly guilty of far greater failings themſelves; and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Methodiſtical ſlander is, of all, the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, bitter, and cruel, and is ſo eaſily diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs by the elect, that it is not worth while dwelling any longer upon it.</p>

In the comedy of the Hypocrite the Colonel ſays, he ſuppoſes they go to the play for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the brethren:—Cantwell anſwers, <q rend="inline">"The charity covereth the ſin:"</q>—which was actually the caſe; for in the year 1757, as Shuter was bountiful to the tabernacle, Mr. Whitfield not only permitted, but adviſed his hearers to attend Shuter's benefit; but <hi>(a-la-mode theatre)</hi> for that night only.</p>
            <p>A preacher at Hull was once in diſtreſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; I actually ſent him a leg of mutton and turneps: previous to that I had been an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant at his tabernacle; he entertained great hopes of my converſion, and I certainly confeſs to the being wicked enough to have been deemed a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Methodiſt. I had then quitted the old playhouſe in Lowgate for a new one in Finkle-ſtreet. That the principal performers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles love to follow the ſmell of a theatre is evident, by their particularly conſecrating thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed ſhops, and thinking them enviable ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations to practiſe their own love-feaſts in—<q rend="inline">"Put out the light, and then—"</q> So this Rev.

            <p>At times I have heard good diſcourſes from Mr. Whitfield, delivered with energy, feeling, and pathos, but then he had been really and truly an actor on the ſtage in the early part of his life; and as he liked tragedy, and found that a pair of ſquint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes (as may be ſeen by his print) did not move the young ladies' tender hearts, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced laughter inſtead of tears, he d—d the ſtage, and ever after ſtuck to that text; but he often melted and ſqueezed to ſome purpoſe many a rich dowager, who felt the power of his feelings from their mutual ſympathy. The low ſtuff of the preachers in general is not worth repeating; but to ſhew I have not often attended without ſometimes being a good boy, I will begin with the ſecond beſt performer in that line I ever ſaw, and give his harangue verbatim; and tho' but frothy ſtuff, it is much better, and more like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than the damnation ſo terribly thundered out,

            <p>Mr. Weſley about four years ago, in the fields at Leeds, for want of room for his congregation in his tabernacle, gave an account of himſelf by informing us, That when he was at college he was particularly fond of the devil's pops (or cards); and ſaid, that every Saturday he was one of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant party at Whiſt, not only for the afternoon, but alſo for the evening; he then mentioned the names of ſeveral reſpectable gentlemen who were with him at college.—<q rend="inline">"But," continued he, "the latter part of my time there I became acquainted with the Lord, I uſed to hold communication with him. On my firſt acquaintance," ſaid Weſley, "I uſed to talk with the Lord once a week, then every day, from that to twice a day, till at laſt the intimacy ſo increaſed, that He appointed a meeting once in every four hours."</q> He recollected, he ſaid, the laſt Saturday he ever played at cards, that the rubber at Whiſt was longer than he expected; and on obſerving the tediouſneſs of the game, he pulled out his watch, when to his ſhame he found it was ſome minutes paſt eight, which was beyond the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had never broken; and what was more extraordinary, that his brother and ſiſter, though diſtant from Cambridge, experienced ſigns of grace on that ſame day, on that ſame hour, in the month of October.

Then Whitfield, looking round the rails of his little deſk below—<q rend="inline">"What, you young ones! why you are ſome of you twelve, ſome fourteen, and ſome ſixteen years of age, yet you do not think of going to hell? What!" exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Whitfield, "twelve and fourteen years of age, and not thinking of going to hell! O ye little

brats you!"</q>—and at that inſtant the old women groaned, and, like fell Charybdis, murmured hoarſe applauſe; and Whitfield ſhook his head, and growled in his white wig, exactly like my perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Squintum, as I actually practiſed it from the ſerious comical diſcourſe I am now relating. Whitfield then proceeded thus—<q rend="inline">"You go to plays! and what do you ſee there? Why, if you will not tell me, I will tell you what you ſee there!—When you ſee the players on the ſtage, you ſee the devil's children grinning at you; and when you go to the playhouſe, I ſuppoſe you go in ruffles—I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether St. Paul wore ruffles? No; there were no ruffles in thoſe days. I am told," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he archly, "that people ſay I bawl—well I allow it, I do bawl, and I will bawl—I will not be a velvet-mouthed preacher, I will not ſpeak the word of <hi>Gud</hi> in a ſleepy manner; like your church preachers—I'll tell you a ſtory.<p>"The Archbiſhop of Canterbury in the year 1675, was acquainted with Mr. Betterton the player. One day the Archbiſhop of Canterbury ſaid to Betterton the player, "Pray inform me Mr. Betterton, what is the reaſon you actors on the ſtage can affect your congregations with ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things imaginary, as if they were real, while we in the church ſpeak of things real, which our congregations only receive as if they were ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary?"
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0593400203:14"/>
"Why, my Lord, (ſays Betterton the player) the reaſon is very plain—we actors on the ſtage, ſpeak of things imaginary, as if they were real, and you in the pulpit ſpeak of things real, as if they were imaginary." Therefore," added Whitfield, "I will bawl, I will not be a velvet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthed preacher."</p>

            <p>I leave the reader to judge on the good reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Methodiſm.

And what a joke for Mr. Whitfield to pronounce damnation on players, when he certainly avowed in his own opinion, that Mr. Betterton was, what all the world ever acknowledged him to be, a ſcholar and gentleman of honour; and Mr. Whitfield gave the players reaſoning and exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for his own mode of preaching.

            <p>But now for my tabernacle at Covent-Garden, where myſelf and Mr. Rich were lately caſting the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0593400203:16"/>
comedy of the Minor, and which was the occaſion of my preaching. Mr. Rich and I were on ſuch ſudden terms of violent friendſhip, that he inſiſted I ſhould caſt the parts. I put down the Minor, Mr. Dyer;—Richard Wealthy, Mr. Sparks, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The morning after, a note came from Mr. Sparks for Mr. Rich, to the following purport: <q rend="inline">"Mr. Sparks's compliments to Mr. Rich, he is concerned at being obliged to return the part of Richard Wealthy; but as he is given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Mr. Wilkinſon is engaged, and is to ſuſtain the principal characters in the comedy, Mr. Sparks cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>onſent by any means to perform or aſſiſt in any piece, for the advantage of a villain, who unprovoked has endeavoured to hurt him in his peace of mind, and injure his reputation, as an actor, with the public."</q>—When Mr. Rich gave me the note to read, it perplexed me much; but I immediately adverted to my very diſagreeable ſituation when at Drury-Lane, and that I had given up every idea of offending the actors of Covent-Garden: that by the artifice of Mr. Garrick and Mr. Foote I was forced on the ſtage at Drury-Lane, in 1758, againſt my own conſent: and requeſted Mr. Rich further to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when my own benefits happened at Drury-Lane, in 1758 and 1759, not any actor whatever had been offended by any imitations or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0593400203:17"/>
mimicry from me; that my ſole aim was levelled at Mr. Foote, for the ill-treatment I had received from him: and as a ſtronger proof, I referred to my conduct in Dublin the winter before, where I had not created a ſingle enemy by ſuch behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; nor at my benefit the ſpring before at Drury-Lane, or offered any entertainment of the kind, either from the deſire of my friends, the public, or even to aſſiſt my own emolument on my late benefits in London, which it certainly muſt be acknowledged it would have done, and much to my advantage; but I readily leſſened my own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits rather than incur enmity: I had in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that conſideration hoped, that I had cleared myſelf from all intentional injury to Mr. Sparks or other gentlemen. This fully proved to my own mind, for once in my life, the good policy of having laid by imitative talents, (Mr. Foote excepted) all that time: for had I kept publicly practiſing thoſe ſhining qualities, as I judged them, and though I was then certainly in great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (while under the trammels of Mr. Foote and Mr. Garrick); yet had I at the latter part of my time with him made too free with my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the theatres, very likely I ſhould not have ſtood any chance of riſing again in London haſtily, or have been ever received at Covent-Garden theatre. Indeed I might have ſubſiſted on Mr.

Garrick's flaps of the ſhoulders of mutton, but, like poor J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rry Sneak, not have got a bit of the brown. My reaſons to Mr. Rich worked as palliatives in my behalf, and had much weight with him. He ſent for Sparks, and in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner related to him what <hi>Mr. Williamſkin</hi> had ſaid: Sparks in a ſhort time was cool and pacified, and ſaid, On the whole it appeared perfectly clear that the young man was not ſo much to blame as he had ſuppoſed: that it was apparent Wilkinſon had not received any reward or gratuity for what he had done, from either of his maſters Foote or Garrick; but on the contrary they had been guilty of meanneſs and ingratitude: And Sparks concluded with not only his declared acceptance of the part, but offered every aſſiſtance to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſals to aid and bring the Minor forward: for its being levelled as a ſtroke at Foote, tickled Sparks, as gratifying his ancient grudge. Though Mr. Foote's acquaintance was univerſal, yet as all knew he ſpared neither friend nor foe, there could not be the leaſt reaſon to apprehend a ſhadow of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment from the audience by any attack of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micry played on Mr. Foote himſelf from any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, as Mr. Foote attacked every body, and, like Drawcanſir, might have ſaid to his friends—
<q>
                  <l>I huff, I bluff, I ſtrut, look big, and ſtare,</l>
                  <l>And this I do becauſe—I dare, I dare!</l>

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0593400203:19"/>
A moſt intimate friend of Mr. Foote's wrote to me the following lines, on my being diſpleaſed, and is a ſtrong likeneſs.— <q rend="inline">
                  <p>"Mr. Wilkinſon you ſhould have known him better long before this time of day; then you would have looked upon him as a peculiar man, with ſuch gifts of originality relative to men, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and places—whether he is in general right or wrong, I will not pretend to ſay; but I will give you this as my own opinion, that if he is wrong, it is difficult to diſpute with him; and when he is right, it is impoſſible to anſwer him."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Peace being ſettled, and myſelf one of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden company, Foote ſoon got intelligence from ſpies in our royal camp, of what was going forward: he was much enraged, and not having forgiven my freedoms with him at Dublin the winter before, he thought I purſued him like his evil ſpirit. And one morning when I was ſitting at the grand levee at Mr. Rich's, with my new friend Sparks in council of war, we were alarmed with a thundering rat-tat and ringing of the bell alſo, when a ſervant announced Mr. Foote was come to wait on Mr. Rich; and inſtead of being uſhered into the grand ſaloon, he had been ſhewn into the parlour.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rich went down to Mr. <hi>Footſeye,</hi> as he called him, but the viſit was not accompanied by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0593400203:20"/>
a calm, for it was moſt violent, bluſtering, and boiſterous. Mr. Foote furiouſly exclaimed—<q rend="inline">"Damn it, you old hound! if you dare let Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon, that pug noſed ſon of a b—h, take any liberty with me as to mimicry, I will bring you yourſelf, Rich, on the ſtage! If you want to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage that pug, black his face, and let him hand the tea-kettle in a pantomime; for damn the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low he is as ignorant as a whore's maid! And if he dares to appear in my characters, in the Minor, I will," ſaid Foote, "inſtantly produce your old ſtupid ridiculous ſelf, with your three cats, and your hound of a mimic altogether, next week at Drury-Lane, for the general diverſion of the pit, boxes, and galleries; and that will be paying you, you ſquinting old Hecate, too great a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!"</q> And after a few ſarcaſms Foote haſtily departed, denouncing vengeance on him and his cats, and immediately Mr. Rich appeared with a moſt woeful countenance, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">why <hi>Muſter Sparkiſh, Muſter Footſeye</hi> has been here, and he ſays if I let <hi>Muſter Williamſkin</hi> act his parts on the ſtage, <hi>Muſter Sparkiſh,</hi> he will write parts for me, my cats, and <hi>Muſter Williamſkin,</hi> and bring us all upon the ſtage; ſo we muſt not act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Is it not truly ſtrange and laughable, that Mr. Foote, of all people, ſhould confeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf galled, and exert his wit againſt mimicry—he who has been for years an univerſal torturer and ſpoiler of private peace, from the licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties he has taken? Now, Mr. Rich," added Sparks, "let me intereſt myſelf in this matter, I augur ſucceſs; therefore let us of Covent-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-theatre, immediately rally our forces, take the field, let ſlip the dogs of war, and act the Minor in defiance of his own guards at Drury-Lane."</q> Rich agreed, ſeemed pleaſed—but he was ſtill frightened of Foote, and I believe, dreaded an affront on his favourite cat more than on himſelf; all was ſettled to have the performance brought forward as ſoon as poſſible: for, as Sparks obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,—<q rend="inline">"advantage <hi>fed them fat while we delayed.</hi>"</q> Indeed the Minor was ready at Drury-Lane, and they meant not to loſe time; for Foote enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not the leaſt doubt of victory.</p>
            <p>We, from various obſtacles, could not get it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently on the ſtage in leſs than a fortnight, as other pieces were preparing, ſuch as Mr. Macklin's new comedy of the Married Libertine; his Love-a-la-Mode; and Mr. Beard and Miſs Brent, were rehearſing Dr. Arne's new opera of Thomas and Sally; which all conſidered, made it ſeem dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0593400203:22"/>
to get our Minor produced. And on the end of the week that this matter had been ſettled, it was advertiſed on the Thurſday from Drury-Lane, and on the Saturday was paſted on every wall—The MINOR; and that favourite little comedy had been all the week puffed and paragraphed in every newſpaper by Mr. Foote. But unforeſeen events ſometimes do and undo what our utmoſt wiſdom and wiſhes cannot, as here was an extraordinary inſtance; for the bills were but a few hours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to public view, when it ſo happened they were as haſtily plucked down as they had been vigilantly put up; it was on Saturday the 25th of October, 1760, when the ſudden death of our truly beloved and lamented monarch King George II. occaſioned, for three weeks, a ſuſpenſion of theatrical hoſtilities and diverſions of all kinds in the great city of London.

On the ſecond night of my perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Mr. Rich at the end of the Minor brought an article for me to ſign, accompanied by Mr. Wood, his ſon-in-law, an attorney; the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was, one hundred guineas for playing till the firſt of January, and a benefit when I choſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it. It was a very genteel offer, as my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit conſidered, made it of real conſequence to me, and of courſe the propoſal was by me accepted, ſigned, and ſealed. On the firſt night, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ormance of Shift, I broke looſe into my imitative
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0593400203:26"/>
qualities, which I had not practiſed (as to actors) in London for two years.</p>
            <p>Moſſop had but the year before gone to Ireland; he was very peculiar, very popular, and well recollected: I was very like him indeed, and was obliged to repeat his ſpeeches of Zaphimri in the Orphan of China.</p>
            <p>To prove what odd mortals we are as to our love and our hate, Sparks, who I related as formerly to have been my profeſſed enemy, was now turned to the other extreme, and was my hearty well-wiſher. On my leaving the ſtage as Shift, he took me faſt by the hand and wiſhed me joy, and burſt out into a violent fit of laughing:—Says I, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Sparks, what are you laughing at?" "Why," replied he, "I am laughing at myſelf, Sir: for two years ago I was bloody angry at you for the carrying me into company where I was not; yet your imitation of Moſſop was ſo ſtrong, that I was irreſiſtibly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed whether I would or no: ſo I am laughing at my own abſurdity."</q> Thoſe imitations having been bottled up by me ſo long had then double the effect, and made Shift a ſtar in the Minor.—My introduction in the character of Foote was truly Foote from top to toe; and as to Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick I made no ſcruple, though I had him before me, as his curioſity had led him to ſee me, not expecting that I would take him, off, or he would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0593400203:27"/>
not have been ſo publicly ſurrounded, but have carefully avoided ſuch a queer ſituation. My imitations were never told either in bill or newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper who they were deſigned for; but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I was particularly lucky, the audience would repeat the name, as Sparks! Sparks! Barry! Barry! Nor was I a little pleaſed when repeating from Macbeth, <q rend="inline">"Who can be wiſe, amazed, &amp;c."</q> I heard the audience echo from one to the other, <q rend="inline">"O Garrick! Garrick!"</q>—O thought I, my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, this is my day of triumph!—and from that night he never forgave or forgot his being ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded in the front box, nor did he ever ſpeak to me again to the day of his death.</p>
            <p>My Whitfield was beyond compare; his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was then univerſally known.—Mr. Foote was ſtruck by ſtepping in by chance, and once hearing Whitfield; the mixture of whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, whim, conſequence, and extravagance, pleaſed his fancy and entertained him highly, as Whitfield that day was dealing out damnation, fire, and brimſtone as cheerfully as if they were ſo many bleſſings. What pity it is that our fears only, and not our reaſon, will bring conviction; but reaſon, handed by unaffected pure piety and religion, would be a day of woe to Methodiſm, and leſſen their audiences in many tabernacles, where they are certain to lament preaching to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0593400203:28"/>
though at the ſame time wedged to the outer doors, and on the Sunday exclaiming at the full crowded theatres, which have probably been almoſt deſerted. But Mr. Foote was only a ſpy at Whitfield's academy, while I had been a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot for ſome ſeaſons before my encounter at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Garden with Mr. Foote. My attendance had been conſtant with my friend Shuter, and as he actually was one of the new-born, and paid large ſums to Whitfield, I was always permitted to ſtay with him, for he really was bewildered in his brain, more by wiſhing to acquire imaginary grace than by all his drinking: and whenever he was warm with the bottle, and with only a friend or two, like Maw-worm he could not mind his ſhop becauſe he thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I have gone with Shuter at ſix in the morning of a Sunday to Tottenham-Court-Road, then before ten to Mr. Weſley's in Long-Acre, at eleven again to Tottenham-Court-Road tabernacle, dined near Bedlam in Moorfields (a very proper place for us both) with a party of the Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> mean) from that to Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie d's in Moorfields till eight, and then ſhut up to commune with the family-compact. Now with all this practice and attention, and with my

natural talents, I muſt have been a blockhead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not to have gleaned ſome good things; (and doubtleſs Mr. Whitfield was at times a good preacher, and truly excellent.) I therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhibited and obtained a much ſtronger like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as Dr. Squintum than Mr. Foote did. The week before my Covent-Garden exhibition I met my friend Shuter at the tabernacle; a great cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had continued for ſome time, as we had not ſpoke to, or even looked at each other ſince the breach between us in the year 1758; but as we were met together in a place of charity and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs to all who ſubſcribed to the dictator, we became very ſociable, and before the concluſion of Whitfield's lecture were perfectly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled: We adjourned to the Roſe, and by three the next morning were ſworn friends, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo till death called him away.—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ned Shuter was a lively, ſpirited, ſhrewd compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; ſuperior natural whim and humour ſurely never inhabited a human breaſt, for what he ſaid and did was all his own, as it was with difficulty he could read the parts he had to play, and could not write at all; he had attained to SIGN an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but no more: Nature could not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed her gifts to greater advantage than on

poor Ned, as what ſhe gave he made ſhine, not only conſpicuouſly but brilliantly, and that to the delight of all who knew him on or off the ſtage—he might be truly dubbed <q rend="inline">"The Child of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:"</q>—He was no man's enemy but his own. Peace, reſt, and happineſs, I hope he now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes—for the poor, the friendleſs, and the ſtranger he often comforted; and when ſometimes reduced by his follies, he never could ſee a real object in miſery and reſiſt giving at leaſt half he was worth to his diſtreſſed fellow creature.</p>
            <p>My popularity that year of the Minor was ſuch, that my acquaintance I might truly term univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. My benefit was the week before Chriſtmas, and was not only crowded, but honourably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, which put my finances into a moſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able accumulation, though my free living from place to place was very expenſive, and indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant:—Yet the reader is to obſerve my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits in general were all free from any charges, and were what we on the ſtage term <hi>clear benefits;</hi> and my night being numerouſly attended in the middle of a winter ſeaſon in ſuch a metropolis as London cannot be judged a phaeno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe two notes I often conſidered, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark was ſo juſt, (though I had not paid obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the firſt) and made me gueſs from that

time to the preſent that they proceeded from the ſecret good wiſhes and knowledge of Mr. Murphy, who was often on parties at Mr. Foote's, and knew what I meant when the public did not:—Whether it was to him I was obliged or no he beſt can tell; if he did, it may have eſcaped his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and he may not recollect ſo trivial a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, as it did not relate to himſelf. Why I take the wiſdom to myſelf of thinking the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters came from Mr. Murphy (who had behaved very kindly to me) is, that in 1759, on my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit night at Drury-Lane, as I was acting the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Mr. Foote, he (Mr. Murphy) was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the orcheſtra; and as I grew elated with applauſe, and feeling to myſelf that all I did was right, I too often made uſe of a particular word, which Mr. Foote thoughtleſsly, and from cuſtom, often repeated laughingly in his own room in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon converſation; it was a word fooliſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicate, and by no means fit to be preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly or ignorantly mentioned in a public theatre; and I had never thought as to the meaning, but was, I declare, moſt perfectly innocent of it; and from my rapid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0593400203:33"/>
this unfit word before a moſt reſpectable audience. I ſaw Mr. Murphy in the orcheſtra enjoying my performance and applauding, which gave me double vigour; when on a ſudden he ſtarted up, and I loſt, from the ſituation full before me, him whom I had ſeen in ſuch high humour, therefore I feared ſomething was very wrong, but what I could not divine;—but I do ſuppoſe, what <hi>I ſaid</hi> ſo repeatedly had frightened him from his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſeat:—Luckily for me the loud laughter and applauſe drowned the ſenſes, or I might have ſeen more decampments, or myſelf have been ordered ſo to do: and I am certain, had I been at that time diſgraced I ſhould not have known for why. But all went off to my exceſs of joy; and when I ſaw Mr. Murphy ſome days after, he kindly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained what had drove him from his place, as he declared he trembled for me, and gave me at the ſame time proper information ſufficient to rectify my error and improve my breeding, without need of Johnſon's Dictionary for further knowledge. This is a leſſon for all imitations to be confined entirely to the modes and manners only with which the audience are acquainted; for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate manners in life of Mr. Garrick, or Mr. Any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, they are neither familiarized to, nor in the leaſt acquainted with, therefore fooliſh to add, by way of garniſh; as what might pleaſe in a private

            <p>My friendly reader, I fear, will be apt to ſhrink, and think I have been too liberal in praiſing and loading myſelf with encomiums re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to my applauſe and reputation in London in 1760, as a rival in point of mimicry, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic eſtimation, when oppoſed to Mr. Foote; but I really aver and believe I have not exceeded the ſtrict bounds of truth. As to the exactitude of time and place I am perſuaded this olio will ſtand foremoſt of almoſt any produced; ſelf is generally partial, and I am obliged to be the herald of my own praiſes: for Shakſpeare ſays, <q rend="inline">"<hi>If a man will not erect his own tomb-ſtone ere he dies, his memory ſhall liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As a true imitator I ſtood before Mr. Foote in the public eye; for though he drew characters ſtrongly, yet his manners in point of likeneſs were not ſtrictly juſt; beſides my partial friends of that time, who cannot now come when they are called, and, for all I know, may now be ſpirits in the <hi>vaſty deep,</hi> yet as theatrical and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vouchers I ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Macklin has often acted by me as a particular kind friend, and to him I am in debt for many obligations of tender regard paid to my juvenile years, and ſince; and as I never made him any equal return, confeſs myſelf his obliged and grateful debtor. Mr. Murphy I have not the ſatisfaction or pleaſure to call an intimate, or even common acquaintance; my frequent laughs with him at that diſtant juncture of time were chiefly occaſioned by my often meeting him on parties at Mr. Foote's and at the New Exchange coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; but Mr. Macklin and I have often met in Dublin, ſometimes in the ſame theatre, ſometimes in our different ſhips of war; and meet him where I would, I cannot but remember civilities, not only

to me, but to any friend I took in my hand to introduce to him.</p>
            <p>With a full purſe, a ſtock of health, and plenty of good friends, my Covent-Garden engagement ended; after which I ſoiled till Paſſion-Week drew near—A week that occaſions the players ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to forget it is a religious one, though their ſuperiors may not have the ſame feeling occaſion to rub up their memories: but every player and playereſs can recollect that week without a prompter.</p>
            <p>Mr. Garrick, as I before obſerved, continued obdurate; but thank God I neither wanted his forgiveneſs nor his favours as a manager.</p>
            <p>Early in March I was favoured with a letter from my good friend Mrs. Strode at Portſmouth, informing me, that a world of people were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected there, as a grand expedition was preparing againſt the French, and the number of officers and ſubalterns both of army and navy would be incredible ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſter: that there were no plays going forward, nor any diverſions whatever; and if I could but hit on any entertainment, it would turn out lucrative to me, and be received as a compliment to the town, and all my friends and acquaintance. I made proper inquiries on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this pleaſing intelligence, and heard every thing Mrs. Strode had mentioned in a manner ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0593400203:37"/>
friendly ſoon confirmed. Now the love of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, added to the allurement of wandering, ſeemed to me irreſiſtible; I knew nothing could be done there in Paſſion-Week, though I might prepare for the enſuing holidays, but did not conceive how to manage and contrive without an able aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant. Mrs. Strode, at my requeſt, procured the theatre againſt my arrival; but one auxiliary at leaſt became indiſpenſably neceſſary.—I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the matter to my laughing whimſical friend Joſeph Auſtin, who liked a frolic as well as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; I therefore did not heſitate a moment as to whom I ſhould impart my perplexity: To him I related my new-fangled ſcheme and want of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, alſo laid before him the glaring temptations of army-officers, &amp;c. and propoſed terms of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Without a pauſe our wiſe heads ſettled it immediately; and that we might be more ſure of attractive merit, Joſeph clapped in his lady as a third performer (a very pretty woman) into the chaiſe, and on Palm Sunday we ſat down to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at Portſmouth: We found the playhouſe as the company of comedians had left it, a mere wreck: They had torn away all traces of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſelf—all little ornaments of what it ought to have been—having removed all the wings and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And conveyed in their baggage-cart at Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth to their fortreſs at Plymouth, themſelves having a long and heavy winter march: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I fear the greateſt part of that theatrical army were obliged on the expedition to uſe their legs inſtead of carriages to obtain ſafe footing at their diſtant Devo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My friend Joſeph and I had a moſt whimſical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining week; I am ſure he never can forget it, as it conſiſted of oddity and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y freakiſh occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. From ten till two at noon we were buſily employed with plaiſtering paper on laths for our wings, and filling up the back part of the ſtage with ſomething like what we term a flat ſcene; indeed we had a carpenter, but Joſeph and Tate were the principal workmen. Before the week was expired our playhouſe was prepared for the receiving a moſt ſplendid audience, with which we were honoured; even our ſtage was crowded and produced the beſt back flat ſcene I ever ſaw,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0593400203:39"/>
which well paid us for our induſtry. We were not only gratified with the great houſe being lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative and faſhionable, but we were ſtill more flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and pleaſed by a deſire of a ſecond night, and with the aſſurance of good ſupport; for my own part I had been ſo fettered and confined while articled by Mr. Garrick, that I was rejoiced at being what I liked to be, and ever will be if I can, FREE <hi>as air;</hi> that by choice ſhall ever be my motto; therefore the ſecond night was palat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quite agreeable to me. But here a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty aroſe: I had engaged to perform for my friend Shuter's benefit on Thurſday, March 26, and that promiſe, without breach of word, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or friendſhip, was eaſy and practicable, as time would juſt allow it, and not any to ſpare; but my trepanned friend Joſeph, on this ſmuggled expedition, was likely to be tried for offences at the grand court of Drury by Judge Garrick, a ſevere judge, who would demand his bond, as Joſeph had actually engaged to play the Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night, March 25, a new part wrote by Mrs. Clive for her own benefit; who at writing was (as may with juſtice be equally ſaid of myſelf) <hi>a dead good one.</hi> However he was very happy, and temptation lay before him:—So fell Adam—So fell Joſeph, though he has not the leaſt relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0593400203:40"/>
to Joſeph the Baſhful:—Notwithſtanding his perilous ſituation he yielded to entreaty, though he foreſaw and dreaded the inevitable ſtorm. We performed much the ſame kind of jumbled incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent entertainment as we had done on the firſt night. We had a full houſe on the Tueſday, and ſoon after ſupper that night my friend Joſeph Auſtin ſet off with his lady for London, and left me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to ſettle all bills, &amp;c. for our private and public expenditure. My friend got to London in a whole ſkin, but too late for his part; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he had been ſo laden the week before with ſtate affairs upon his head and ſhoulders, that had he been there a day ſooner I do not ſuppoſe he had ſtudied ſufficiently to have known a ſentence.—The lamentable conſequence to Mrs. Bayes (or rather Dame Clive) was her being obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to change her new farce, or have an apology made for the part to be read—which I underſtood was kindly undertaken by Mr. Packer, but am not certain. However the piece was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately d—d, and the dreadful doom of it ſhe attributed entirely to the neglective and audacious behaviour of that impudent Auſtin; it enraged that truly comical lady (on the ſtage only) to the higheſt pitch of fury; not Ceres with her torch ſet the fields of corn on fire with more eager fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic fury than ſhe would have at that inſtant

               </gap>ynagogue, Garrick himſelf, could ſhe have dragged him to her altar of revenge; but <q rend="inline">"ſuch divinity ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds a king"</q> that he eſcaped her vengeance by a ſecure and ſpeedy retreat; and if truth may be ſpoken, I am inclined to think on this matter he was more indebted to flight than his divinityſhip for ſafety: as be it known, though our monarch Garrick uſed to be lordly and managerial over great and ſmall, yet Dame Clive (like the Welch) was never ſubdued—indeed the great little man dreaded her. As an inſtance—I remember one night, while I had the honour to appertain to Drury-Lane theatre, Lethe was to be acted by deſire of ſeveral perſons of diſtinction: The bill run thus: <hi>A dramatic ſatire called Lethe</hi>—The new character of Lord Chalkſtone by Mr. Garrick; and not any other performers mentioned, not even Woodward's or Yates's—Mrs. Clive's part was the Fine Lady.—There were ſeveral actors of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the piece, but whether it had been printed in that manner by deſign or accident I know not, as play-bills publiſhed daily muſt be liable to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, even though Mr. Kemble was the manager. Madam Clive at noon came to the theatre and furiouſly rung the alarm bell: for her name being omitted was an offence ſhe conſtrued ſo heinous, that nothing but vengeance, and blood! blood!
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0593400203:42"/>
Iago was the word! and it was no more ſtrange than true that Garrick ever feared to meet that female ſpirit. Perhaps Mr. Croſs the prompter might think Garrick's name was all-ſufficient; but her not ſeeing in the bill <q rend="inline">"The Fine Lady by Mrs. Clive,"</q> was ſo unpardonable an offence, that could ſhe have got near him, and he had been ſevere in his replies, I dare ſay ſhe would have deranged King David's wig and dreſs as adorned for Lord Chalkſtone, which would have diſconcerted him much. Mrs. Clive was a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of combuſtibles—ſhe was paſſionate, croſs, vulgar, yet ſenſible, and a very generous woman, and as a comic actreſs, of genuine worth—<hi>indeed, indeed,</hi> ſhe was a diamond of the firſt water.—When her ſcene of the Fine Lady came on, ſhe was received with the uſual expreſſion of gladneſs on her approach, as ſo charming an actreſs truly deſerved; and her ſong from the Italian Opera, where ſhe was free with a good ridiculous imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Signora Mingotti, who was the darling favourite at the King's Theatre, and admired by all the <hi>amat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urs,</hi>—ſhe was univerſally encored, and came off the ſtage much ſweetened in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and manners from her firſt going on.—<q rend="inline">"Aye," ſays ſhe in triumph, "that artful devil could not hurt me with the Town, though he had
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0593400203:43"/>
ſtruck my name out of the bills."</q> She laughed and joked about her late ill-humour as if ſhe could have kiſſed all around her, though that happineſs was not granted, but was willingly excuſed; and what added to her applauſe was her inward joy, triumph, and ſatisfaction, in finding the little great man was afraid to meet her, and which was of all conſolations the greateſt; not our brave Rodney could feel more pride or glory on the French Admiral de Graſſe delivering up his ſword to him, than Madam Clive did in the idea of her ſubduing Garrick. The valiant Boadicia never hurled her ſpear with more furor than Clive, that Amazonian Thaleſtris of Drury-Lane theatre, purſued that great general, Garrick, whenever he offended her; indeed the whole green-room dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her frowns. She was the original, and quite at home when in the Cobler's Wife in the Devil to Pay, and always proved that Poor Nell had a great ſoul; indeed, to thoſe who approached her door in miſery, ſhe ſupplied their wants, and gave at once without pride or oſtentation. Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick alluded to Mrs. Clive in Nell, and Mrs. Pritchard in the Queen in Hamlet, when he wrote and ſpoke the following lines the ſeaſon that Barry, Cibber, Quin, and Woffington, united forces at Covent-Garden—<q>

               </q> So Madam Clive, of whom I have been ſpeaking ſo long, when her farce was d—d, as ſhe could nor ſtart that Fox Auſtin from his hiding-place, at laſt found Mr. Garrick her darling prey, whoſe curioſity had led him back to take a peep at the field of battle, after beholding her farce and its fatal overthrow, and had exultingly fat ſmiling at the tumult, and enjoying the ſtorm, which grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his ſpleen; and indeed her works, I believe, were truly indifferent, and would not have cut a much better figure in print than my own; with this difference, ſhe profeſſed ability, I profeſs quite the contrary, cry quarter, and ſue for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Clive, like the good houſewife, who ſees a rat in the trap in the morning taken, no ſooner eſpied him than ſhe faſtened; and the furious poeteſs bitterly and vehemently harangued her manager as abetting and aiding in a plot to ſink her works to oblivion, by being privy to Auſtin's having eloped, and thereby deſtroying her fame. The manager proteſted his innocence, nay acted great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

war was not to be defended; and what added to his crime in Mr. Garrick's eye was, that he had been with that infernal exotic, Wilkinſon, to whom he never granted abſolution. He d—d Wilkinſon, he d—d Foote, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Lacey, I ſay, ecod we will have no more exotics at the theatre!"</q> and concluded with a determination to diſcard Auſtin, for he was at that time really an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and offended with him, and much diſapproved of his intimacy with me, as his jealous fearful temper ſuggeſted Auſtin (who was in full confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him) might give information now and then of <q rend="inline">"The forbidden ſecrets of his priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe:"</q> He at length pacified Clive, convinced her he was not concerned in the plot, and hoped to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I have mentioned this on gueſs, and if I am wrong in my aſſertion ſhall be happy to retract; for I would not advance a falſehood fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

any advantage whatever, and Mr. Auſtin can eaſily in any newſpaper contradict what I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and inform us of Mr. Garrick's generoſity. Mr. Auſtin is an inſtance of one who ſome time glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the ſunſhine-beams of court favour; yet with all his dependence on the great man in hopes of independence, he never could obtain his wiſhes and expectations; for, like the Miſer, Joſeph wanted to <q rend="inline">"to touch ſomething real,"</q> but was only paid (as Ramilie) with forgiveneſs of all that had paſſed.</p>
            <p>At length wearied out, Mr. Auſtin was under the neceſſity of leaving his friends and country, and ſeeking a refuge and aſylum in Old Ireland: He never more returned to his old maſter Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding Mr. Garrick's oddities, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did and ſhall reverence, reſpect, and eſteem him as the greateſt actor the Britiſh ſtage has ever known, from its firſt eſtabliſhment to the preſent day: but in other points I have only given the picture as it ſhould be, from the life, with all its ſpots, blemiſhes, and beauties; ſo my conſcience may reſt: as certainly, if my narrative reſpecting his treatment of myſelf be true, there remains no call of any trait of Mr. Garrick from my pen but juſtice.</p>

            <p>Mr. Garrick, though attached to ſubordination, was kept in order and decorum himſelf by our preſent ingenious writer, Counſellor Murphy; that gentleman could teaze his ſoul, and gall his gizzard whenever he pleaſed or judged himſelf wronged. Mr. Macklin my maſter Garrick did not much love, though formerly they were on a friendly footing, but the Drury palace gates againſt his irony were faſt cloſed. When Barbaroſſa (wrote by the late Dr. Brown) was produced, Garrick the firſt night entered after the fourth act in a glittering ſilver-ſpangled tiſſue ſhape; when Mrs. Clive, inſtead of court adulation, cried out, <q rend="inline">"O my God! room! room! make room for the royal lamp-lighter!"</q>—which rudeneſs diſconcert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him much for the remaining part of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and certainly it was too free, and not well timed, as he was tremblingly alive all over on the firſt night of a new part in a new play; and it

               </gap>ertainly is a ſerious matter in London, and a ſervice of danger.</p>
            <p>Before I arrived in town from Portſmouth for Shuter's benefit, Mr. Arthur (manager of the Bath company) came to that town on the plan of building a new theatre there, as the inhabitants much wiſhed for a better and more regular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of performers. Mr. Arthur waited on me, wiſhed me joy on the ſucceſs of my two nights public <hi>impromptu</hi> at Portſmouth; and as his friends, who had encouraged his new undertaking, wiſhed to ſee me there again the enſuing ſummer, he hoped it would turn out mutually agreeable and lucrative to himſelf and me;—the matter was ſettled and agreed between us. He then made another propoſal for my playing ten nights that ſpring ſeaſon at Bath, with a clear benefit—that was alſo agreed on, and I left Portſmouth and got to London on Wedneſday night, March 25, 1760, and on Thurſday gave Tea, as I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſed, for my friend Shuter's benefit; and I may with great truth affirm with wonderful applauſe: The approbation intoxicated me ſo much, that the night following, being in company with Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Ballard the treaſurer, I conſented to pour water on the leaves for his benefit early in May, though I had engaged for Bath, and knew I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

back again; but my deſire for applauſe increaſed my thirſt: it went down ſo deliciouſly, that I was glad to cover that as an obligation, which in fact I was pleaſed to be requeſted to do, and thought no price I could pay equal to public ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. I did not then ſo well know the fickle changes of Fortune as well as life—Would I were young again!—But let it go—A fooliſh figure! farewell it.</p>
            <p>I arrived at Bath well, and without the leaſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue; the next day I paid my reſpects to Mr. Arthur, alſo to Mr. Ridout, with a thouſand compliments from Mr. Rich, who was unhappy at his ill-declining health calling him there, and obliging him to quit Covent-Garden theatre; to which place he never more returned. He was the only man in whom Mr. Rich placed any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, or whoſe advice he would liſten to. Mr. Ridout being prime miniſter, he was of courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpattered with plenty of abuſe; but he, like me and Benedick, cared not for a ſatire or an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram:—for if a man will let himſelf be beaten with brains, he ſhall wear nothing handſome about him.</p>
            <p>Ridout was extremely glad to ſee me at Bath, and when my benefit was advertiſed he ſent me a letter deſiring three box tickets, and begged my acceptance of the incloſed three guineas, with his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0593400203:51"/>
beſt wiſhes and thanks for having ſo honourably kept my promiſe in 1758, not to meddle with his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of acting any night of my imitations at either of the London theatres. The three guineas was meant, it is true, as a <hi>dcuceur,</hi> and I had ſome t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rtainly had deprived myſelf of a credit as to the imitation; and I pin my faith more on Mr. Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin's opinion than on my own merit: for Mr. Macklin when I laſt ſaw him declared I had taken ſuch exact meaſure of Mr. Ridout, that my like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him was my maſter-piece. At Bath he died:—When I ſaw him there he appeared in a weak languid ſtate, not in immediate danger—
<q>
                  <l>But who can controul his fate?</l>
               </q>
I ſo fly-like (Mr. Aircaſtle myſelf) from one point to another, that I can apologize, but cannot help being incoherent.</p>
            <p>Bath was then certainly a pleaſing ſpot:—Now I am told, and it is well known, that city has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed at an incredible rate of elegance, to the aſtoniſhment and admiration of all Europe. In that city Mr. Keaſberry treated me with my firſt dinner, and I was particularly lucky by unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly meeting with an unthough-of bleſſing; for in a few hours after my name had been publiſhed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

agreeable pleaſure of receiving cards from my ever dear remembered friends and patrons Mr. and Mrs. Chaigneau and Mrs. Forbes, and ſome others from Ireland—a moſt happy intelligence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for me, abſtracted from intereſt. Bath was at that time, and ſtill continues, a place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, faſhionable, and friendly reſort of perſons of quality and fortune from the kingdom of Ireland: It was in truth a fortunate circumſtance, as they immediately introduced me not only to a genteel but faſhionable reſort of friends, who were of the utmoſt ſervice in fixing my reputation as a public performer amongſt all the circle of their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, beſides the certain allowed credit, convenience, and ſelf-ſatisfaction on my Bath onſet as an actor, to have ſuch eligible and eſteemed places to dine at, and be received as a particular friend and viſitant at Mr. Chaigneau's in Gay-ſtreet, and Mrs. Forbes's in Queen-ſquare, &amp;c. I played a variety of characters there, and it would be tedious and fulſome to repeat the favours I received; every perſon I knew conſulted to make me happy. My benefit was on Monday, April 27, 1761—Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy the play, with Tea and the farce of the Guardian—I acted Mrs. Amlet, and the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, with Tea; and in the courſe of my playing I acted Richard, Lear, Hamlet, and Shylock—parts in the Minor, Cadwallader, Petruchio, &amp;c.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0593400203:53"/>
My benefit was honoured with ſo great a demand for places, that the <hi>whole pit was laid into the boxes,</hi> a circumſtance which had not been often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced. A large party, with the late Lord Clive, were that night contented with places in the pit: Indeed a theatre is ſuch a ſtrange place, that the ſeat which is faſhionable one night is horrid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for ſometimes if only the firſt rows of the ſide-boxes are taken the cry is, <q rend="inline">"Not a place to be had in the boxes; every ſeat is let!"</q> The front-boxes, if Mrs. Siddons acts, are called good places, and acknowledged (as they truly are) to be the beſt ſeats in the houſe for ſeeing a play; but on any night, if not wiſhing to be at the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, and yet wanting an excuſe to ſtay away, the cry is, <q rend="inline">"It is horrid—it is a bore.—Who can ſit in the front-boxes? thoſe giblet pies!</q>

            <p>When my nights with Mr. Arthur were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired I had engaged to perform Lady Pentweazle and Cadwallader for his benefit on Monday, May 4; but Mr. Ballard the Covent-Garden treaſurer, (with Shuter's ſummons) advertiſed me in the London papers according to my promiſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The two laſt plays were Hamlet and Richard the Third: the firſt for the benefit of Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liames, (termed the <hi>Ancient Carpenter</hi>) on Friday, June 5, 1761; and the laſt, for Mr. Wooley the painter, Monday, June 8.—The farce was <hi>Hob in the Will,</hi> in which Mr. Wooley appeared in the character of <hi>Hob.</hi>

            <p>The reaſon for my being ſo particular as to the days, months, and years, on trifles not worth doubting is, that it helps as a reference to the profeſſed plan with which I ſet out, and to make good my aſſertions with thoſe now living, who might think it worth while either to corroborate or contradict my relation of facts with the ſtricteſt obſervance of time and place.</p>
            <p>From thence I lounged at Wincheſter until the new theatre at Portſmouth (building under Mr. Arthur's inſpection) was ready for the reception of the Bath Company, at that time under his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, where I reſorted according to beat of

drum and marching orders on the 1ſt of July; but when I ſaw the deſolate ſtate of the building, I judged it impracticable for its wide extended walls to have a play enacted that good year of our Lord: However Arthur was indefatigable; ſlow, and ſure; and in ſo ſhort a time as Monday, July 20, <hi>Hamlet</hi> was announced for opening our new theatre, with the farce of the Contrivances—Hamlet, Mr. Wilkinſon; Polonius, Mr. Arthur; Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atia, Mr. Keaſberry; the Queen, Mrs. Lee.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Lee was wife to the late Mr. Lee, and mother to the preſent Miſs Lees of Bath: One wrote the pleaſant comedy of the Chapter of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; and the other that entertaining and well-drawn romance of the Receſs. Mr Lee was well known in London as an actor of merit at Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden, alſo as manager and performer at Edinburgh and Bath. But ſome diſpute had happened about a year before I was at Bath between Mr. Lee and Mr. Palmer, (the Bath proprietor) which not being amicably ſettled, Mr. Lee withdrew; but ſhe very ſenſibly (not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given any cauſe for complaint) deſired to be retained.</p>
            <p>Our new grand theatre at noon, on the 20th of July, had not the leaſt appearance of being fit to be opened that night, either before or behind the curtain—the whole company were of that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0593400203:60"/>
opinion: But great men will overcome obſtacles, and the wonder-working incomparable Arthur deſpiſed difficulties. At twelve o'clock at noon there was not one ſeat in the pit, but he actually contrived to get it finiſhed by ſeven. Not any rehearſal was poſſible, as the ſtage was up to one's waiſt in ſhavings. The populace were eager to ſee the new playhouſe, new company, and the firſt acted play; but on traverſing the ſtreets from four till ſeven, and no admittance, they became very noiſy, the ſailors particularly unruly; when into the ſtreet popped our old croſs commander in chief, Admiral Arthur—not like his advertiſed character of Polonius, but more reſembling one of the witches in Macbeth; for he had on an old round flapped hat, a woman's checked apron, with a large broom in his hand, and his face as begrimed and greasy as a barn-acting Othello in the Dog-days: He harangued the multitude, high and low, and humbly beſeeched their patience while himſelf and the hard-laboured carpenters aſſiſted in ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhavings out of the pit and gallery: He received a good hooting with a laugh, and retired to make his words good by deeds, and Hecate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like he ſweated and ſwept moſt violently, till the word without was given, as their impatience was beyond bounds; the doors were burſt open, the witch and her ſtick were thrown down and rolled
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0593400203:61"/>
over and over; the broom had no other charms or ſpells than to aſſiſt the cripple to hobble out and eſcape with all poſſible expedition; there were no perſons ready, or offices fixed to take the money, ſo each ſailor and his laſs, or his companion and others ſeated themſelves in ſuch places as ſuited their fancies. But Arthur to ſhew his humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs acted as a wary and careful manager; for, without putting off his apron, as ſoon as the houſe had filled and all were a little quiet and ſeated, in the midſt of a cloud of duſt he doffed his old brown hat, and went profoundly round the theatre to collect in it from every part what he could either by threats or civility obtain: ſome did pay, others did not, and ſome only what they pleaſed; nor would he have ſtirred till twelve at night whilſt he beheld the glimpſe of another dropping ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have paid for their forcibly-obtained foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When he had finiſhed that difficult job he retired to what was abſolutely requiſite, ſoap and ſand, and in about an hour more (the hour of nine) we proceeded on with our ſolemnity. Mr. Arthur was transformed—a long old periwig and a ſumptuous ſuit of clothes gracing his perſon for Polonius (a part which he had often performed in London, and acted truly well); but the lamps and candles having been loaded with the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of our kindred duſt from Hecate, (the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager's

outrageous ſweepings) had occaſioned ſuch a miſt and violent heat on the audience-part of the theatre, on the ſtage, behind the ſcenes, and had diſperſed ſuch an univerſal melancholy gloom as I never can forget:—every one of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and the well-warmed (nay I may ſay nearly parched) ſpectators became reflectors of burning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I muſt not omit before I quit Hampſhire to mention, that early in Auguſt 1761, Mr. Lee had hired a banditti ſet of actors to perform at Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter every Saturday for a few weeks, a camp being there, but far inferior to the encampment I before deſcribed the preceding year; but I agreed on ſuch nights to accompany Mrs. Lee, he paying the carriage for two days, the Saturday and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and to have a clear benefit; which engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he punctually fulfilled, but we differed about ſome trifle and did not part friends. Mr. Lee was very fond of teaching to act, with which he amuſed himſelf from Saturday to Saturday with almoſt as thin a company as Gibbet's in the Beaux Stratagem—I am ſure it did not double it.—The ſalaries the reader may be ſure were poor, as Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter with the little camp could not afford great expences ſo as to procure Mr. Lee a living, and the additional charges of my going there with Mrs. Lee; yet Mr. Lee being known as an actor of merit, the officers were pleaſed and obliged to him for their Saturday's lounge, and made it a point to do all in their power to ſupport him.—Mr. Lee would not lead off the firſt play—I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was really afraid, his ſpirits being daſhed, as whoſe would not; like Falſtaff, who ſays, <q rend="inline">"If I be not aſhamed of my ſoldiers, I am a ſouſed gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The firſt play was on Saturday, Auguſt 8, 1761. There was not any thing appeared to Lee to be ſo practicable as my doing the parts in the Minor, ſo the Minor was fixed on without any other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment whatever; and it was acted from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in a very mutilated ſtate, as it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the people Mr. Lee had ſo ſuddenly and with difficulty collected could be perfect in the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſcenes where I was not concerned: However a very genteel houſe appeared of Mr. Lee's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and I was well received as their old favourite acquaintance, having been there a whole campaign the year before with the Bath company; ſo from conſideration to Mr. Lee and myſelf, they went away in perfect good humour, profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pleaſed and ſatisfied with their ſhort enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 15, we acted the Fair Penitent: Mr. Lee had amuſed himſelf with drilling his troops, and the play had one great claim to being well received, as it was very perfect. Lothario, Mr. Lee; Horatio, Mr. Wilkinſon; Lavinia, Mrs. Burden, who had acted Charlotte in Love A-la-Mode at Covent-Garden, and the lady I have ſo often mentioned as the <hi>infernal limb;</hi> Caliſta by Mrs. Lee. The farce was Lethe—The Old Man and Lord Chalkſtone, Mr. Wilkinſon; French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mr. Lee.</p>

After the hard duty I had ſuſtained of marching and counter marching from ſtage to ſtage, and the buſineſs univerſally heavy on me at Portſmouth garriſon, no wonder if I wiſhed to indulge a few weeks autumn repoſe, with that beſt good phyſician my mother, who

               </gap>ſt I viſited my old maſter Mr. Rich, who had ſome weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered Mr. Ballard the treaſurer to write me a letter of invitation, and that I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by his manager to be in London by the 20th of September, the opening time of the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don theatres, with an offer of 6l. per week, and to be ready in the character of Bayes, and to ſign an article for three years, benefits included in the propoſal. My engagement with Mr. Arthur, rendered a compliance (with honour or any degree of honeſty) impoſſible. My non-attendance much offended Mr. Rich, as he thought (and very juſtly) he had made me a very genteel and comfortable offer; but after I had two or three times attended his mornings levee, we became as good friends as ever. He even condeſcended to requeſt a favour, which was, that I would make my firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a farce, which he told me ſecretly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, was of his own writing; and I have reaſon to believe it was, and that it will not be eagerly contradicted or claimed on account of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed honours to poſterity. It was called the Spirit of Contradiction. He ſaid, if I would but act the part of the Gardener from his <hi>larning,</hi> it would make my fortune, <hi>provided</hi> I would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly yield to his inſtructions.

            <p>When I ſpoke of the Gardener for Mr. Shuter (who was the Edwin of the time) inſtead of myſelf, he took his ſnuff, ſtroaked his cat, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"If I give it <hi>Muſter Shuttleworth</hi> he will not let me teach him, and he is ſo idle: I want it perfect <hi>Muſter Williamſkin;</hi> but I will <hi>larn</hi> you <hi>Muſter,</hi> if you will play the part from my tuition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We were one noon, hard at work with the part of the Gardener, when Mr. Younger the prompter abruptly came into the room on urgent and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſtage ſtate-affairs, Rich perceiving him, turned haſtily about, and in a rage ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Get away <hi>Muſter Youngmore,</hi> I am teaching <hi>Muſter Whittington</hi> to act."</q> If queſtioned why I have ſpoken of Mr. Rich ſo reſpectfully, yet draw ſuch a caricature? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,

my obligations to him at firſt were not thoſe of a good kind, that I altered my opinion, by having notions ſuperior to prejudice, and as a true drawing of character, without giving tints of theſe oddities, ſtrangers would have no true notion of Mr. Rich's real manner and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal oddities: And I wiſh every writer, good or bad, never dealt in more ſatire or intention of doing harm than my inſignificant ſelf. Indeed Mr. Rich's peculiarities are not here obſerved as a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, for his beſt friends then, and thoſe who now remain cannot but ſay the relation is not more whimſical than true.</p>
            <p>When I had undergone ſix days leſſons, and repeated the Gardener line by line, and to the beſt my ear could conduct me, Mr. Rich ſaid, <q rend="inline">"No engagement with his <hi>larning</hi> me, unleſs confirmed by an article ſigned for three years."</q> Now I had been ſo weary of Mr. Garrick's ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and above all loved to ramble, and was ſo habituated to get money and be my own maſter, that I could not by any means reliſh the leaſt idea of bondage; for being at liberty (excluſive of the profit) ſeemed doubly pleaſant and alluring. So in ſhort, after a pauſe, with heſitation, and finding I could not gulp down an article, I frankly told him my diſpoſition; but that I was notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his command, on his profered terms for

            <p>The day before the fracas happened, I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter of preſſing invitation from Mr. Moſſop, then manager of Smock-Alley theatre in Dublin. That unexpected treaty could not have been brought about after Moſſop's declared aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had it not been for the willing interference of Counſellor Barrett. That gentleman had a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0593400203:75"/>
ſtrong partiality for Mr. Moſſop, as a friend and an actor; they had been bred I underſtood at college together, which laſting intimacy induced Mr. Barrett to be ever ready to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conciliation and acts of kindneſs; for the which, I doubt he ſuffered very conſiderably (tho' willingly) by frequently encroaching on his own ſubſtantial finances to the generouſly aſſiſting Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop with material ſums at times when bewildered, and plunged in his fatal airy ſcheme of being an oppoſing manager, which too frequently occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned various occurrences and diſaſters at different periods; for which generous benevolence, I fear the friendly hearted Counſellor never had a chance or poſſibility of being reimburſed: however he was affluent, and did not want money, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſtreſſed actor unhappily did. I relate this from conjecture only, never having been on a footing of intimacy with Mr. Barrett to enable me to vouch for its authenticity, though infinitely obliged to him in Ireland, in 176<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for many civilities which I am ever pleaſed to acknowledge; likewiſe his being inſtrumental to the bringing me and Mr. Moſſop on terms of amity once more in 1762: but that governour of reſtleſs players was not by any means bleſſed with a tythe of Mr. Barry's pleaſing abilities as an actor, or generous qualities as a man or manager. Mr. Barry had certainly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0593400203:76"/>
a moſt enchanting faſcination beyond the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral lot of mankind; as a proof, it was ſeldom either creditor or <hi>enemy</hi> left Barry in an ill humour, however in other reſpects diſſatisfied or diſappointed. Mr. Moſſop was overloaded with a quantity of combuſtibles, conſiſting of pride, inſolence, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and gall. I reviewed the difference as to the reſpective managers; but Moſſop's offer claimed a priority of preference, as being the firſt, and that offer was liberal. The reader will think it ſtrange that Moſſop ſhould have any engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with me after his declarations; but he judged (I ſuppoſe) it was better policy to keep ſuch a miſchievous monkey in his own theatre, where he might play his tricks at the expence of the enemy, than ſuffer pug to be at the oppoſite one, and be let looſe upon himſelf. He wrote me word I might depend on every friendſhip in his power, to render his theatre agreeable; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated, that after his generous perſentation he truſted I would not deal ſo unlike a gentleman when I arrived in Dublin, as to enter or liſten to any terms whatever as to engaging with Barry and Woodward, which I aſſented to. On my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival Mr. Moſſop and I ſoon ſettled all prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it was early in January and a few days after Chriſtmas holidays. My firſt appearance was in the <hi>play</hi> of the Minor, (which two years before
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0593400203:77"/>
had been damned as a <hi>farce</hi>): it would have been hazardous; but its being inſinuated and advertiſed with a pompous account of the amazing run and ſucceſs it had met with at all the three theatres in London, not omitting to mention conſiderable alterations, which by ſo doing obtained a verdict in favour of ſeeing and hearing it acted. And as Mr. Foote has been mentioned to have obſerved the difference of weather, humours, and various accidents that make for and againſt to render it impoſſible to account for the uncertain changes in theatrical events, ſo the Minor was acted to a very fine houſe, received with univerſal applauſe, and continued to be performed twice a-week to good houſes.</p>
            <p>My imitation of Mrs. Bellamy (in Shift), with the Introduction, the Puppets, and a Mock Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta Imitation, &amp;c. were of great ſervice. The Minor was well ſupported, as may be perceived by the following caſt.—I acted Mr. Foote's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; the Minor, Mr. Jefferſon; Mr. Wealthy, Mr. Sowden; Sir William, Mr. Baddely; Loader, Mr. Ryder:—Lucy, Mrs. Kelf. In that theatre I met with my agreeable friend, Mrs. Abington, in high eſtimation; ſhe did not ſee her old friend Tate with a new face. She had grown weary of being connected with Barry and Mrs. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, as the latter could not reliſh the triumph of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0593400203:78"/>
Miſs Notable, nor could Miſs Notable patiently ſubmit to the inſolence and affected ſuperiority of Mrs. Conqueſt. My agreeable acquaintance Mrs. Kelf, now Mrs. Egerton, with her mother and ſiſter, were at Moſſop's theatre; and if this book falls into her hands, ſhe will laugh very heartily on recollecting the many happy days, and whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical adventures which occurred that winter in dear Dublin. Whenever I remember the happineſs I there experienced, and the numerous obligations I received in that city, I ſigh and languiſh for another peep, ere I depart to meet my many good friends of great Britain and Ireland which have gone before me, to that country <hi>from whoſe bourne no traveller returns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Moſſop and myſelf, for the firſt three weeks, were on the moſt intimate footing. I dined twice with him at Dr. Wilſon's apartments in Trinity College; he was a ſtaunch friend of Moſſop's. (I believe the Smock-ally theatre was Dr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's property.) Theſe dinners, I ſurmiſed, were intended to induce me, by their mutual rhetoric and perſuaſion, to attack Barry and Woodward; but that I declined from policy. For I propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally judged it moſt likely that this ſudden apparent friendſhip would not be of very long duration, as I knew in his heart he hated me: ſo the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I depended on his good will was very
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0593400203:79"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ak and frivolous; and when he wanted to be quit of me, I ſhould have ſhut Barry's doors againſt my ſweet ſelf. However I propoſed, over our claret, to take great pains with Woodward's favourite character of the Barber, and he might advertiſe my name for it in the manner of the original, which ſeemed to pleaſe Moſſop much; a plain proof how we reliſh ſatire againſt others, and how little we allow for it againſt ourſelves: It was immediately brought forward.</p>
            <p>The next day after being with Mr. Moſſop, I waited on the attractive Abington, and importuned her aſſiſtance in Termagant, which ſhe good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turedly complied with. She was at that juncture of time in her full bloom and prime of life: ſhe has had her day—Miſs Farren now has her day; and ſhe, I hope, will live like the French beauty Madam Ninon de l'Enclos, who captivated her ſon by her charms when ſhe was at the age of ſeventy.</p>
            <p>I told Mrs. Abington I ſhould revive the Jealous Wife for my night, if ſhe would favour me with playing Mrs. Oakley, ſhe conſented to ſtudy it againſt the 22d of February. Indeed ſhe, that winter, as well as in 1760, paid me great civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and I never received a favour in my life that I was not grateful for, and ever ready and proud to acknowledge. It was ſurpriſing that ſo truly good a comedy ſhould have been in print
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0593400203:80"/>
two winters, and not brought forward properly at either of the Dublin theatres. We acted the Author three or four nights, and it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by their Graces the Duke and Ducheſs of Northumberland; his Grace was at that time the Lord Lieutenant. The Upholſterer was often repeated, and I was eſteemed ſo very like Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the part, by my having ſo exactly copied his manner and dreſs, that I do not believe Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Cibber's relation of his likeneſs of Dogget in Fondlewi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e was in truth beyond my exact repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Woodward in the Barber. Lady Pentweazle alſo helped to make out my twelve nights, with the repeating the ſucceſsful comedy of the Jealous Wife, in which I acted Mr. Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. That year, early in March 1762, both the tragedy candidates Barry and Moſſop, had fixed on performing Othello on the ſame Monday, for their benefit play. Moſſop relying on his novelty, Barry on his long-eſtabliſhed reputation; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans prepared for battle, bets ran high and furious as in the preſent days for pugiliſm. Moſſop's holder of the ſtakes was the Counteſs of Brandon, heavy in demeanour, but alert in apprehenſion. Her l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he two combatants, by promiſing to Barry, that provided he would poſtpone his night to the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he would alſo command that evening's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, by which means the town would be kept in good humour, the particular friends of each reſt ſatisfied, and, his Grace alſo added, he ſhould (by ſuch attention and compliance from Mr. Barry) not be deprived the pleaſure of ſeeing him in his favourite character of Othello, which always afforded him the higheſt ſatisfaction.—Barry of courſe complied, and was not inwardly diſpleaſed that the critics (without a diviſion) would have ſuch an immediate opportunity to compare notes on the ſkill and ſuperiority of the declared opponents. On this remarkable occaſion each houſe was equally thronged, though Barry's on the Tueſday was the greateſt receipt, as Crow-ſtreet, was capable of containing more than Smock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alley; otherwiſe party zeal added to curioſity, raiſed auditors in ſuch ſuper-abundance as would have filled Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden theatres. As to victory, Barry's Othello was ſo meritorious as to make Moſſop's viewed at a diſtance only; he was as much ſuperior in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Moor, as Moſſop would have been to Barry in Richard or Zanga. I ſat the evening of Moſſop's benefit in an upper box, where a lady, who ſat next me, exclaimed on Moſſop's firſt appearance, with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0593400203:82"/>
an archneſs and humour peculiar to that nation, <q rend="inline">"O! faith Moſſop has got two eyes in his belly?"</q> This ſhrewd remark was occaſioned by his wearing a heavy emboſſed ſhape, (fit for Brutus or Cato) a dragon's face on the breaſt, with two large gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring red ſtones for the eyes, his face and wig being black, conveyed exactly what the lady had ſo iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically expreſſed. Mr. Barry, though maſterly that night of controverſy, had frequently ſhewn himſelf to more advantage, merely owing to his then taking too great pains in his favourite and much eſteemed part; which proves, that lucky ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents fortunately combined with nature will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſtrike out more beauties for an artiſt than all the moſt determined force of premeditation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Moſſop that year had an Italian opera com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which was of infinite ſervice to him, but aſtoniſhingly hurt his own conſequence: for what with parties and other diverſions of routs, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, concerts, &amp;c. with which Dublin in the winter abounds, and oppoſed by the forces of Woodward and Barry (for they ſtill maintained their faſhion and good report) the great box nights were chiefly confined to thoſe of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettas. That agreeable ſinger and actreſs <hi>Signora De Amicé</hi> was the principal, and was almoſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ſhe after that greatly ſucceeded at the opera houſe in London, as the firſt ſerious woman ſinger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0593400203:83"/>
Theſe Italian comic operas were all the rage, and were ſupported at the following prices:—boxes, pit, and lattices, 5s. 5d.—middle gallery, 2s. 2d.—upper gallery, 1s. 1d. Dublin was then torn to pieces by the perpetual application for one theatre or the other; it was reduced quite to a party matter. The Counteſs of Brandon would not be ſeen at Crow-ſtreet upon any account, but attended conſtantly at her dear Moſſop's. Barry, I believe had at leaſt converted the ladies two to one in his favour. Barry's making love, when on the ſtage, left tender impreſſions; but yet this play-begging at laſt grew troubleſome, and ended with fatal circumſtances, of which an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count has before been given.</p>
            <p>Moſſop, when he had a good houſe, inſtead of endeavouring to extricate himſelf in any degree from his multiplicity of difficulties, grew deſperate, and inſtead of paying either his tradeſmen or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, flew to the gay circles, where he was gladly admitted; and in order to mend his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fortune by the chance of a die or the turn up of a card, of which I believe he was ignorant, and unacquainted with the neceſſary arts to ſucceed. He has often left the theatre with a hundred gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas in his pocket, and returned home with an aching head and heart; but his guineas, with debts of honour, were all left behind. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0593400203:84"/>
of Brandon ſerved him greatly it is true; but often the money ſhe occaſioned being paid at the theatre returned to her own coffers. This was the univerſal opinion of Dublin, and is all I can alledge in that caſe as to its authenticity; and, as to Moſſop's poverty, there needs no evidence for that unfortunate reality.</p>
            <p>This conduct, and a train of evils attendant thereon, ſoon preyed upon his health, involved his talents with himſelf, and gave bitter ſours to that temper which was, in its natural ſource, far from being one of the beſt. An inſtance of the poverty his performers were reduced to in 1764 I will, with permiſſion, relate.</p>
            <p>The Diſtreſſed Mother was to be acted—Oreſtes, Mr. Moſſop; Andromache, by Mrs. Burden (whom I have ſo often mentioned.) The ſalaries had not been paid for ſeveral weeks, and ſhe was in true character as the diſtreſſed <hi>woman.</hi> With infinite difficulty ſhe forced acceſs to the General Moſſop; for it was hard to accompliſh admittance on account of many inconvenient reaſons, unleſs on a Sunday, and on that grand levee-day performers and tradeſmen were too menial to be admitted. But with the force of a heroine, who dauntleſs ſurmounts all barriers and tyrants at will, ſo Mrs. Burden burſt into the <q rend="inline">"inmoſt receſs of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon houſe,"</q> and when arrived at the royal hall, ſhe was as determined to preſerve character—for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0593400203:85"/>
at the awful voice of Moſſop ſhe, Andromache-like, was proſtrate at the feet of her royal maſter, and uttered forth in tragic tones, <q rend="inline">"O! Sir, for God's ſake aſſiſt me, I have not bread to eat, I am actually ſtarving, and ſhall be turned out into the ſtreets."</q>

Abington: With Tea, Bucks have at ye All, and the farce of the Country Houſe.</p>
            <p>My engagement with Moſſop being expired, I intended ſoon leaving my old favourite ſpot, which was now become a home; but was detained by Mrs. Abington's requeſting I would ſtay and aſſiſt her in a ſcene of fun and humour for her benefit night, which ſhe had complied with at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of her really good benefactor Lord Miltown. Mrs. Abington, had often entertained ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel parties with ſome droll ſtories of a good gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman ſhe named Mrs. Fuz. I had been on parties with Lord Miltown and Lord Clambrazil, when in high ſpirits and good humour, and had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted myſelf and the company with ſtories and anecdotes, of my dear, favourite, old lady, Mrs. White, of whom the reader muſt by this time have formed ſome idea, by referring back to what I have before related of my darling old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman's ſingularities.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Abington had promiſed Lord Miltown ſhe would produce herſelf as Mrs. Fuz, and ſhe would prevail on her friend Wilkinſon to do the ſame, as Mrs. Jenkins (alias Mrs. White); which information his Lordſhip made known to all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of diſtinction in Dublin: but the peer did not reflect, that thoſe ſtories told by myſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0593400203:87"/>
and Sir Francis Delaval and Mr. Foote knew the mother and the daughters, as well as myſelf; but on a ſtage where few of the audience were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted either with the character that Mrs. Abington or I repreſented, the joke was as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find out as Mr. Bayes's laughing violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his own Prince Volſcius, where the joke lay in the boots.—Her play was Rule a Wife—Leon, Mr. Moſſop; Copper Captain, Mr. Brown:—Eſtifania, Mrs. Abington. Between the play and farce, an interlude called Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Fuz. Mrs. Jenkins, Mr. Wilkinſon; Mrs. Fuz, Mrs. Abington. Before the night came, we often entertained ourſelves with extempore rehearſals, and conceived ourſelves eaſy, perfect, and entertaining. Mrs. Jenkins was dreſſed before the play concluded. Mrs. Abington, after an epilogue of ſhrewd turn, and ſpoke with great point, retired to dreſs as Mrs. Fuz; our dreſſes had been before well conſidered.—It was a crowded houſe; part of the pit laid into the boxes. Mrs. Abington had ordered an excellent ſupper, ſuperbly lighted, &amp;c. and had wrote a little intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory dialogue-ſcene in the ſtreet between two gentlemen, giving a deſcription of a party they were that night invited to, and where two extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary characters were aſked for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentof the lady's gueſts, at whoſe houſe the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous was appointed; but each perſon was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0593400203:88"/>
to lay their fingers on their lips, and not to laugh on any account whatever, but to pay every mark of attention and approbation, in order that the two ladies might with more unlimited free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom diſplay their different abſurdities. After the dialogue was finiſhed, the ſcene was drawn up, and diſcovered ſeveral well-dreſſed ladies and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at ſupper:—Miſs Ambroſe was ſitting at my elbow as the daughter of Mrs. Jenkins, who intended bringing her on the ſtage:—Mrs. Fuz was ſeated at one front corner of a long ſupper table, and I was at the other: Mrs. Kelf was at the head as lady of the ceremonies, which was the only good part, for there were the ſervants with wine, and ſhe diſplayed on the occaſion her being miſtreſs of a good knife and fork. On being diſcovered, and looking ſcornfully at each other, our two figures had for ſome time a fine effect; loud fits of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceeded, and from theſe great expectations were formed.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Fuz then deſired Mrs. Jenkins to begin—Mrs. Jenkins deſired Mrs. Fuz would do the ſame—and we found ourſelves in an aukward ſituation: But after a few efforts the two ladies entered into a hobbling ſhort converſation, which was received very well, from the eager opinion that ſomething better would follow, for the audience were all eyes and ears; but we ſoon flagged: Mrs. Fuz aſked for a glaſs of wine—ſays Mrs. Jenkins, <hi>upond</hi> my <hi>ſould</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0593400203:89"/>
and I will have a glaſs of <hi>wind</hi> too. Then Mrs. Fuz ſaid, when ſhe was firſt married her two <hi>breaſteſes</hi> were ſo large, you might have carried a plate of ſalt upon them:—That did not do, and the Abington began to feel it a ſervice of danger, perplexity, and diſgrace.—Mrs. Jenkins called to her daughter to act Juliet, and obſerve her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to ſtick herſelf upon the ſtage as if ſhe was chilled and ſtabbed <hi>throfout:</hi> But as ſhe kneeled down to act Juliet, the ſtrange old lady, Mrs. Fuz, got up, gave her a kick, ran away, and abandoned Mrs. Jenkins to the mercy of the audience; I was well aware of what might be expected, and therefore loſt no time, but aroſe and ran after her, crying out, <q rend="inline">"Mrs. Fuz! Mrs. Fuz!"</q>—The audience began to ſmoke the joke, and by their tokens of anger gave the neceſſary hint to the ſtaring ladies and gentlemen on the ſtage, that a retreat would not be imprudent if they regarded their ſafety; ſo they ran away alſo, which cauſed a laugh; for it was evident when Mrs. Abington and I had eloped, they were ignorant what to do, not knowing but that we meant to return, for they were only deſired to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tay on till we finiſhed, which the performers could not conceive would be ſo abruptly as we made it, but expected us to come back and make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to our characters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0593400203:90"/>
I hope Mrs. Abington has not forgot this, but will laugh at it as I do; though it was truly auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the time, and it really drew Lord Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town into diſgrace, for he had ſaid ſo much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the promiſed ſcene, that it had been the converſation of the preceding week.</p>
            <p>When the curtain dropped, which was with loud marks of cenſure, the ladies univerſally aroſe, and, by way of joke, laughed and courteſied to each other, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Your ſervant, Mrs. Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins; your ſervant, Mrs. Fuz!</q>—which I dare ſay vexed his Lordſhip much, not only for his own and the diſappointment of the audience, but more ſo, as any failure of Mrs. Abington's was morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to him; for he was then, and I am told is now a moſt violently attached and true patron and well-wiſher of hers. Mrs. Abington, in her epilogue after Eſtifania, had ſpoke ſome lines very ſarcaſtically aimed at Mr. Woodward; who, to ſpeak truth, deſerved it at her hands: they were very ſevere, and her being ſo great a favourite, and delivering them moſt excellently in Woodward's manner, ſtung him to the quick. Indeed he was ſo much irritated by her arch exhibition, that it put a ſtop to my intended ſail for England, and was the occaſion of an intimacy between hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the ſame misfortune has been known in London to have happened: for when it comes to the tag, as we call it, of a well-known play, we at rehearſals, like careleſs people at church, begin to move off before the bleſſing is pronounced; and from

               </gap>, by viſiting his Dublin friends and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers after an abſence of three years. Great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were formed, yet the attraction failed, and on his benefit in particular, which was the Monday after mine; for an influenza had ſeized men, women, and children: I never was worſe with any illneſs than at that time. Auſtin and I
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0593400203:96"/>
were in the middle gallery on his benefit night, when I do not believe there were twelve perſons there beſides, nor much more than 14l. in the houſe, even though Mr. King played Bayes in the Rehearſal, and had to change his dreſs between two or three of the acts, for he ſpoke Bucks have at ye All! and acted in Mr. Garrick's Interlude of the Farmer's Return from London, and had his abilities, aſſiſted by a very good company, as may be ſeen in the bill of the Jealous Wife.</p>
            <p>Mr. King's good ſenſe will not be angry at this recital, for it is an inſtance of the power of faſhion, more or leſs, in every place: But when Mr. King, a few ſeaſons after, returned, the people were not ſo unwitted; for on his being advertiſed to appear in Lord Ogleby, it was with the utmoſt difficulty a ſeat could be obtained, not only for his firſt night, but ſeveral ſucceeding ones; all ran in crowds to ſee their old favourite Tom King every time he performed, though a very bad ſet of players to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him.</p>
            <p>Dublin is remarkable for doing a great deal for the actor, or nothing; and if one particular part by a performer happens to pleaſe their fancies and judgment, once a week to the end of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it will fill the houſe. The winter 1788, in November and December, he performed with as high ſpirits and more profit than on any

preceding he ever made there; and was ſo careſſed and eſteemed by every one, that they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented when his firſt engagement was finiſhed with the manager, and therefore he agreed for twelve nights more after Chriſtmas, which was equally beneficial with the firſt: and the Iriſh hoſpitality was ſuch, that it is well he got away with ſafety; for wherever they eſteem, they are apt to endanger the healths of their gueſts with acts of kindneſs. He then went to Scotland and performed four nights at Glaſgow, (which run in regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, Tueſday, Wedneſday, Thurſday, and Friday) and each night to an overflowing houſe. On the Saturday he travelled forty-four miles from Glaſgow to Edinburgh, where at ſix o'clock there was not a ſeat to be had in any part of the theatre, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> little country air, I requeſted my friend Auſtin
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0593400203:98"/>
to dine with me at one of thoſe pleaſant villages with which Dublin is romantically and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſurrounded. At our return, on entering the metropolis, I accidentally caſt my eyes on the plaiſtered-up play-bill, and, to my infinite ſurpriſe, read <q rend="inline">"The Orphan: Caſtalio, Mr. Barry, &amp;c. and between the play and farce Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> will give TEA: After which, Mr. Macklin's Love A-la-Mode."</q> I thought it very ſtrange, unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented, and rude behaviour, my nights being expired, and my time delayed, that Mr. Barry or Mr. Woodward ſhould improperly advertiſe me for what I was not then prepared for at their terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and that done by one or both without a line or meſſage. I felt myſelf angry and hurt, and declared I would not attend the theatre, but Mr. Auſtin perſwaded me much not to abide by that reſolution: He urged, that the managers had acted rather cavalierly, but judged it much more adviſable to avoid offending my friends or the public, or even the managers; we might meet again: it was always better to be on terms with thoſe leaders in power; and he did not doubt but they meant to pay me ſome compliment. To this friendly admonition and advice I not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively liſtened, but obeyed its dictates, went to my lodgings, dreſſed and prepared to give ſome jumbled performance at the playhouſe: when there,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0593400203:99"/>
I complained of the ill behaviour, which the graces of Barry ſoon made eaſy, and prevented me from permitting rage to fire my boſom. When the Orphan finiſhed, and Barry had, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy huſband of Monimia, departed to the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary ſhades, I in a few minutes informed Mr. Carmichael the prompter, that I was ready to give the whole houſe Tea, tho' without cups and ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; but juſt when the curtain was drawing up, the ſaid Carmichael came in a violent hurry and told me he came with peremptory orders from Mr. Barry, that I muſt not on any pretext whatever attempt to proceed with my part of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the evening until the end of Love A-la-Mode, and that Mr. Macklin inſiſted on that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction being complied w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. Macklin was ever tenacious of his favourite of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>spring, and he judged, I do conjecture, that any delay or laugh <hi>immediately after</hi> the tragedy from the audience might in ſome ſmall degree take off the reliſh when Love A-la-Mode began. However I perſiſted, that if I obliged Mr. Barry with doing what he had not the leaſt right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and or expect, I would, unleſs I was then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to perform, inſtantly quit the theatre: To that declaration Barry did not pay much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as he was ever intimidated by Mr. Macklin, and tremblingly alive and fearful of his

deſertion to Moſſop, the mortal opponent of Crow-ſtreet citadel, of courſe neither my petition nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance could prevail; and I, as obſtinate as either, not only left the royal army under the command of the maſter revellers, but, inſtead of going home, retired to Mr. Acheſon's, a private and worthy family in Trinity-lane, where I was aſſured not any purſuers would ever dream of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me; or indeed if they had, I ſhould not have returned.</p>
            <p>After inquiring as to the termination of the evening at the playhouſe, I was informed that all went on ſmoothly; the piece received the tribute due to its merit, and Macklin, Barry, Woodward, and Meſſink a repetition of approbation which their reſpective merits had ſo frequently obtained: Not one of the three leading perſonages had caſt a thought on Wilkinſon, nor did they ſuppoſe he would be called for; or if he was, that a ſlight apology from the manager of Mr. <hi>Tate's</hi> departure would ſettle all matters amicablv.</p>
            <p>But the event proved much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for when the farce finiſhed, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience were judged to be departing, on peeping through the curtain a few minutes after their ſuppoſed <hi>exeunt omnes,</hi> they were all eſpied in dread array, and as regularly ſeated as they had been viewed the hour preceding; and on neither

preparatory muſic giving the elevating ſound, nor Mr. W. making his expected appearance, from a murmur a violent clamour enſued, when ſpeedily Mr. Barry ſtepped forward and informed the large aſſemblage the whole matter; that Mr. W. it was true had been there, but for what reaſon Mr. B. could not divine Mr. W. had as unexpectedly as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly eloped: however, that would not in the ſmalleſt degree pacify them; they judged their rights infringed, and their authority much impoſed upon, inſiſted on my being ſent for, and ſaid they would ſit patiently till I attended and fulfilled my duty—but all the meſſengers' ſearch was fruitleſs—and, indeed, had it been otherwiſe, and they had found me in my hiding-place, I ſhould not have returned to have endured the wrathful reſentments and diſgrace I certainly had not deſerved and muſt have ſuffered, but, ſnail-like, would have pulled in my horns, and kept ſnug and ſecure within my ſhell. For the manager certainly, (as I was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged then to him) had not the right or the power to act as he did; and I, forewarned of the diſpleaſure I had incurred, had prudently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined I would not venture my ſweet ſelf again in their field of battle that year of our Lord. On their patience being exhauſted, and Mr. Barry's aſſurance of the various means taken to recover the loſt ſheep, the whole blame fell (as was likely)

            <p>Wedneſday the 25th of Auguſt, The Rehearſal—the firſt time I ever acted Bayes.</p>
            <p>The company was ſummoned by Mr. Yates to Preſton on account of the jubilee, which is kept there with great feſtivity, and celebrated every twenty-one years:—he had engaged ſeveral principal Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don performers. I returned back to Cheſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eager to ſee my friend Smith and family, and other new acquaintance at that place; but I made my journey thither a pleaſant round, and took Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton in my way: I met Mr. Sowden coming from Ireland on the road, and he turned back and wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0593400203:109"/>
with me to the Jubilee, and then to ſtay with me a few days at Cheſter. At Preſton we found very bad accommodations, very dear, very dirty, and much crowded. The proceſſion was tolerable, but not worth the trouble or expence of a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſee it; indeed I was very glad on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day to perſuade Mr. Sowden to quit Preſton for Cheſter, for it was all confuſion and mire, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the main ſtreet, which I recollect is ſpacious and handſome, but it was the crowd and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency that made us glad to depart; and we went from thence to Liverpool, where I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before been; and after one day's view we croſſed in the Eaſt Ferry to Cheſhire, where we ordered a poſt-chaiſe, and got in good time to dinner at Cheſter.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sowden's intimacy with me began the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before at Mr. Moſſop's theatre, where he was a ſub-manager at that time. He was a ſenſible ſhrewd bred man, looked on in general as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably inſincere; not that I ever met with any thing from him in any reſpect, but the oppoſite conduct. I once went with him from Dublin to Wicklow (a pleaſant ride) to receive ſome rents there: He was very entertaining, and a great epicure: He was poſſeſſed of an ample fortune, the conſequence of being a good economiſt, and well knowing how to lend his money to great advantage, yet not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0593400203:110"/>
without good ſecurity: He made himſelf generally pleaſing, as he never contradicted any body, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked any thing at another perſon's table, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways approved. If a gentleman had ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sowden, that cabbage-leaf thoſe ſtrawberries are on is a fine leaf?"</q> he would have ſworn a loud oath, that the cabbage-leaf not only was a handſome cabbage-leaf, but, by G—d! the handſomeſt cabbage-leaf that ever grew. He was father to Mrs. Jackſon at Edinburgh, and I believe ſhe only came in for an inconſiderable part of his fortune; but of that Mrs. Jackſon is the only competent and proper judge; and I ſincerely hope my conjecture may be quite wrong for her ſake.</p>
            <p>From Cheſter I went to London, where I had not paid my dutiful reſpects for ſeveral months, and there had a welcome not to be ſuſpected. From thence, for a few nights, I paid a viſit on the eve of the peace being ſettled between France and England, to my brandy company of the old thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre at Portſmouth; the Bath commander had left that place for his regular winter quarters: ſhips of war were ſailing daily into the harbour to be paid off, conſequently money was plenty, and the theatre well filled. I had not viſited my friends for a full year, I was therefore a kind of novelty, beſides having attained a ſupply of new characters. The 20th of October, 1762, I acted Lear, alſo
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0593400203:111"/>
Bayes, &amp;c. and finiſhed with a crowded benefit and well-pleaſed theatre. I have often wiſhed once more to walk thoſe ramparts, and take a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpect of my juvenile part of life, ſo frequently employed on that ſpot where I was then ſo highly gratified with friends, pleaſure, and credit; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever opportunity offers, I will indulge myſelf for a few days with that trip. From Portſmouth I returned by the road through Saliſbury to Bath, where I expected without doubt an engagement; but there my vanity or my hopes, call it which you will, were fruſtrated as to the theatre. Mr. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur thought I aſked too much, and I, that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered too little; in conſequence thereof Mr. Simpſon of the great rooms obliged me with them to exhibit in; and actually I had, to a jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, ill-conducted medley, at 3s. per ticket, not leſs than 60l. and I was at very little expence, Mr. Fleming leading <hi>gratis;</hi> in ſhort, the night was univerſally faſhionable, and every body was willing to ſerve me, which eaſily accounts for any ſucceſs of that kind however wonderful it may appear. It actually had ſuch general ſanction, that the theatre was ſo deſerted as to be obliged to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed for the want of an audience on that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; an inſtance perhaps never before or ſince there, within living memory. I had a ſecond night on Thurſday, Dec. 16, and very genteely
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0593400203:112"/>
attended, 35l.; it was much better conducted and approved, and would have been more lucrative had my firſt been more properly conſidered.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to Briſtol, where I had never before been, and on Tueſday, February 1ſt, I had a moſt brilliant and crowded audience, at the aſſembly room, in Princeſs-ſtreet. Mr. Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſted me again as leader, and gave his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's Sermon on his violin; for which he was much admired and applauded, and was truly a worthy man, and univerſally eſteemed; he was father to the Miſs Flemings now of Bath. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the compliment in a ſmall degree by once performing for his benefit at William Wiltſhire's rooms on the 28th November, 1764, at Bath; but he aſſiſted me twice there, and twice at Briſtol.</p>
            <p>I was much obliged to the ladies and gentlemen at Briſtol for their general patronage, and their kindneſſes ſhewn me on thoſe nights, as except Mr. Church at the White Lion, Broad-ſtreet, Briſtol, I did not know even the names of three people in that opulent city, my whole time there was entirely confined to Mr. and Mrs. Church. They behaved with great kindneſs to me, as I was very ill under their care in a fever near three weeks.</p>

            <p>On my recovery, from thence I returned by Bath to London, for a few days recreation, and then ſet off on an invitation I had received from Mr. Ivory, manager of the Norwich theatre; ſo there was another new trip. Mr. Hurſt (whom I had known in Ireland) was appointed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting manager, and I believe was the occaſion of the offer. Mr. Hurſt I had often met in my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0593400203:114"/>
(as Garrick termed it) and his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour at Norwich was kind and attentive to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree both as to my profit, when my benefit was to be fixed, and in every other particular. In return I really underwent infinite labour; for he worked me not as an horſe of blood; but as an horſe for burthens, I even now ſink at the very thought of how I drudged and toiled in that theatrical Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich mine.</p>
            <p>On Monday, February 29, 1763, I played Othello; on Saturday, March 5, the Minor. Mr. Banniſter, ſenr. was there, and took his firſt ideas of mimicry from ſeeing me play thoſe parts in the Minor, Cadwallader, and other of Mr. Foote's pieces. My playing in the Minor drew <hi>repeated</hi> and <hi>increaſing</hi> good houſes. This may appear as a ſtretch; but Mr. Dodd was there, to whoſe ſervices I have been much obliged at York: he was a reigning favourite at that time, and I call on him to vouch, that tho' the city of Norwich is not the moſt theatrical town in the kingdom, yet that audience to any piece that is well received will bear a more repeated acting of it than any other town of the ſize whatever. I think the Padlock was acted twenty-five nights the firſt ſeaſon; now, that to be accompliſhed from its production there with only four plays, or but three in a-week, I look upon to be equal to fifty times in London.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0593400203:115"/>
Norwich ſeaſon was then five months. I acted Bayes four play nights progreſſively—Saturday, March 12, Monday 14, Tueſday 15, and Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day 17. The Rehearſal was much liked, though not calculated for any audience <q rend="inline">"to pit, box, and gallery it"</q> out of the meridian of London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Bath, or York.

               </gap>ius, was acted by Mr. Dodd, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent clever Mr. Banniſter played the grave ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Mr. Smith; the Gentleman Uſher, Mr. Weſton, who had not then acted in London (and was not in any degree of eminence as a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.) I do not believe, take it for all in all, that Norwich ever had a better company than that identical ſeaſon; Mr. Chalmers was there as a comic actor, and I fear I ſpeak truth when I ſay, I verily believe he was a greater favourite than Weſton; he was father to Mr. Chalmers with me at York ſome ſeaſons, a young man of merit and a very good harlequin.</p>
            <p>I will here mention that an adventure of mine, related by Mrs. Bellamy in her ſixth volume, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to Mr. Chalmers the comedian, of Norwich, paſſing for Wilkinſon, the York manager, is no more than ſtrictly true, however vague, romantic, and improbable it may appear to a ſtranger. I have been often taxed as to its authenticity; but the following perſons are ſtill inhabiting this earthly

The day I met my friend Socia Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at Hollytown, was on Saturday the 16th of April, 1774. But as that matter is not in the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to my adventures at Norwich, and leſt I ſhould ſtray until I am bewildered, I will get back to that town, and inform the reader, that after being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially and partially received in ſeveral principal characters, my benefit night there was fixed on Monday, April 11, 1763. I had been lucky to a degree in having the honour to pleaſe the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Norwich, and almoſt every part repeated again; alſo the farces were approved, and Bucks have at ye All, there was no end to. I played at my benefit, King Lear, and promiſed to treat all the ladies and gentlemen with TEA, which was ſeriouſly taken by the people in general as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract they expected would be fulfilled: it was thought very expenſive, and would be attended with much difficulty and trouble; but Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon was vaſtly genteel, but then how would he be able to find cups and ſaucers for ſuch a quantity of people?

In ſhort, the town was in a mob at three o'clock in the afternoon, to ſecure a firſt ſeat if poſſible to ſee Mr. Wilkinſon and drink a Diſh of Tea with him. The interlude given that night as Tea, was the ſame kind of mixed entertainment, conſiſting chiefly of the imitations of thoſe actors, and the ſame materials which had been ſo greatly received in London, Dublin, &amp;c. and with which the reader has been peſtered from the firſt volume of this complex—<hi>what d'ye call it—ſomething—nothing of a book;</hi> for the work will certainly be allowed originality, and that no ſuch hurlo-thrumbo production as to information of jumbled matter and anecdotes ever before appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! What is more extraordinary than the ſtrange
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0593400203:118"/>
miſtake which aroſe in the peoples' ideas, ſhould not only have been taken as ſeriouſly offenſive at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich then, but it actually laid the foundation for fabricating a thouſand ſtories, and Fame increaſing as ſhe goes, told the tale with wonderful additions to the children of that time, and remembered by thoſe young ones who then could not liſp; yet they can now relate what their daddies told them of me, (Wilkinſon) who promiſed to give all the town Tea, and behaved ſo ill, he would not keep his promiſe, but made a joke of it.<q>
                  <l>On eagle's wings immortal ſcandals fly,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It was ſoon after my departure circulated, and even put at length into the newſpapers (which muſt be true) that I was obliged to ſecure my perſonal ſafety by flight, that I ordered a poſt chaiſe with four horſes, took all the money which had been received that night into a large ſilk handkerchief, without waiting to count if all was right, and got out of Norwich with all expedition, leſt I ſhould have been torn in pieces by the enraged multitude; and when I arrived in London, they ſaid Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon laughed at the Norwich flats, and an hundred ridiculous falſehoods of that kind were propagated, and handed carefully down by that generation and piouſly tranſmitted to their children. Now the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0593400203:119"/>
plain matter of fact was no more than by not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying them really with the eager expected Tea, the thirſt for which was ſo great that I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve had Mr. Garrick been King Lear they would have thought the play had been too long; but when they found no Tea, they did not reliſh what I was doing as the way by any means to make them amends for the inſult they ſuppoſed I had wilfully given to their underſtandings; but what was more, my likeneſs of Mr. Barry, Mr. Sparks, or any of the London performers was Greek to them; and it was natural for them not to admire what they could not by any means comprehend. The difference of audiences in ſuch like circumſtances is amazing. A farce, if it poſſeſſes true humour, in London will be greatly reliſhed and applauded: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the country very poſſibly the ſame (even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently acted) ſhall be termed vile, low, vulgar, and indelicate. The Love for Love of Congreve, the Trip to Scarborough, the Way of the World, the Confederacy, and others, are in London attended to as plays of wit and merit, (witneſs their conſtant repetition) but in the country not permitted, or if permitted to appear, not upon any account faſhionable, which is juſt as bad.</p>
            <p>The ſame unlucky reception of my Tea at Norwich, would happen to the ableſt imitator in London, ſuppoſing he gave the ſtrongeſt likeneſſes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0593400203:120"/>
of the Edinburgh and York actors; a London audience ſo tried would feel not only chagrined and diſappointed, but would give ſuch tokens of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and anger, as would far exceed that of the enraged Norwichers. My farce that night helped to confirm my diſgrace; for out of London certainly no one was ſo very likely to diſpleaſe as Mr. Foote's Orators, not only quite obſolete but local: let any perſon now take it up of the age of twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five, and it will puzzle the beſt head to find out or comprehend how at that time, even in London, an audience could poſſibly be entertained by it, however well acted. The porter-club, the laſt ſcene of the farce, gave it a complete overthrow, though aſſiſted by Mr. Weſton; their patience was quite exhauſted, and I could barely make a finiſh. I dare ſay no lady can feel this account more forcibly than Mrs. Wells; for without being on the ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At thoſe little jokes I was applauded in Peter Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph; but as to the ſtories circulated, and believed about my running away from conviction of inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional affront from myſelf, they were too ridiculous to tell, and more ſo to be credited; what added to the idea of deſigned inſult that night was at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of my Tea, I gave a Medley which Mr. Garrick himſelf had wrote for Mr. Beard, and given to me; he deſigned it firſt as a compliment to Mr. Beard for his Ranelagh benefit, but after that he altered it for the playhouſe.</p>
            <p>The lines taken as rude, were the very harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ones that follow, to a common tune—<q>
                  <l>Now if you think I'm wrong,</l>
                  <l>In all I've ſaid or ſung,</l>
                  <l>And wiſh that poor I had been dumb, dumb, dumb,</l>
                  <l>Tho' the fiſh are in the net,</l>
                  <l>Yet I ſhall fume and fret,</l>
                  <l>And though I have caught you be mum, mum, mum,</l>
                  <l>I therefore beg and pray,</l>
                  <l>That nothing you will ſay,</l>

For if like you they're taught,</l>
                  <l>They'll not like you be caught,</l>
                  <l>And therefore I pray you all mum, mum, mum.</l>
               </q> Their being in an ill humour, and my ſinging thoſe lines in the medley very gravely, (as I judged a very good joke) they abſolutely took ſeriouſly, and occaſioned all the buſtle and nonſenſe here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and in reſentment they echoed back—<hi>hum, hum, hum;</hi> and it was agreed, <hi>nem. con.</hi> that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally laughed at them.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak my thoughts on the matter, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived myſelf much injured by ſuch ill-ſuſpicions and miſconſtructions on all I had done; and I really had fatigued myſelf more that night, hoping to pleaſe, than almoſt any one I ever performed before or ſince; as it was too much even for a ſtronger conſtitution than mine.</p>
            <p>As I remained on the ſpot, inſtead of quitting Norwich, my very extraordinary departure from which I ſhall immediately give an account of, that muſt ſatisfy all who believe or diſbelieve to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

but be buried and forgot: But there are thoſe who can vouch to the inglorious and diſgraceful truth, and I can boaſt as being one of the firſt who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved my brethren in the country from ſuch ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Another cuſtom was, after the play the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was to return thanks, and if married, both huſband and wife to appear. Mr. Frodſham once at York ſpoke a comic epilogue on his benefit night, and actually carried his wife (now living) on and off the ſtage on his back, to comply with the expected homage:—on particular occaſions four or five children to make up weight, courteſying and bowing in frocks, had a wonderful effect, as the audience in general, and the ladies in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, prided themſelves upon beſtowing their bounty on ſuch a pains-taking man, or ſuch a pains-taking couple as they proved themſelves to be. Tho' I had heard ſo much of thoſe cuſtoms, yet I was honourably received after all my alledged ILL-BEHAVIOUR <hi>at Norwich,</hi> as uſual, with much pleaſantry and good humour. The laſt night of my acting there I made as polite an acknowledgement as lay in my power, and meant what I ſaid, that I really thought myſelf, as a ſtranger at Norwich, particularly honoured and obliged; which coming unexpectedly was received with double effect, and I was diſmiſſed with great glory and marks of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0593400203:130"/>
and the audience were not a little pleaſed that I confeſſed myſelf indebted to them for the favours they had conferred on me.</p>
            <p>Now, after ſuch particulars, it is really aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſuch falſehoods to the contrary could be propagated and believed from that time 1763, and never cleared up till 1787, when I was laſt at Norwich, and will be much more ſo by this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful account. Another ſtrange cuſtom they had at Norwich, and if aboliſhed it has not been many years, which was for a drummer and a trumpeter (not the King's) in every ſtreet to proclaim in an audible voice, having been aſſiſted by his ſhrill notes to ſummons each garreteer, without which ceremony the gods would not ſubmit to deſcend from their heights into the ſtreets to inquire what play was to be acted, nor aſcend into the gallery.</p>
            <p>A cuſtom of this kind prevailed ſo far with a Mr. Herbert's Lincolnſhire company in the time of our revered, well-remembered, and beloved Marquis of Granby, that when at Grantham the players determined to omit the uſual ceremony of the drum, wiſhing to grow more polite; and by obſtinate perſeverance, Lady Jane Gray, Mary Queen of Scots, King Henry the Eighth, the King of France, nay even Cardinal Wolſey had no command, attraction, or power over the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace when they loſt their accuſtomed and ſo much
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0593400203:131"/>
loved ſound of the drum and trumpet. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were obſtinate, tho' they could not by all their arts, or by all their charms, obtain a livelihood; and their heroiſm was ſo great, that they preferred death, honourable death, rather than ſubmit to ſlaviſh terms. The Marquis of Granby ſent for the manager of the troop, and ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Manager, I like a play; I like a player; and <hi>ſhall</hi> be <hi>glad</hi> to <hi>ſerve you:</hi>—But, my good friend, why are you all ſo ſuddenly offended at and averſe to the noble ſound of a drum?—I like it," ſaid the Marquis, "and all the inhabitants like it: Put my name on your play-bill, provided you drum, <hi>but not otherwiſe.</hi> Try the effect on to-morrow night; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

noble Marquis. They left Grantham in great credit, without being drummed out of town, tho' accompanied by their friend the drummer; and I am told the cuſtom is continued at Grantham to this day. This is a ſtrong proof how difficult it is to ſurmount prejudices, whether in religion, politics, or even ſo trivial a matter as the ſound of a drum; for rumour has fewer tongues than ſhe has ears.</p>
            <p>But, my good reader, obſerve, I have not yet in my Hiſtory got from Norwich:—if you will kindly look back to Mr. Kennedy's acting Leon the laſt night I played there in 1763, I muſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inform you, that after all my quarrels, &amp;c. with Mr. Foote, however contradictory to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves and Mr. Foote's repeated declarations, he had ſecretly ſent Kennedy to Norwich as an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour with credentials, neither more nor leſs than not only to preſent articles of peace, but fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

an engagement, which he hoped would prove laſting and advantageous to both; that in many pieces, dividing the parts, would be better for each of us; for however clever he might flatter himſelf to be from his own opinion and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of the public, he was convinced one perſon perpetually before the audience, be he ever ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and meritorious, had not ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as by a little ſpace ere he was ſeen again: (a certain good remark for me then, and many young performers now, to remember). His letter added, that he had wrote a part purpoſely for me in a new farce called The Mayor of Garratt, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0593400203:134"/>
would do him the favour to make it my home whenever not better engaged.—This was a change! and it was flattering, profitable, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable.—I inſtantly made propoſals, which were immediately agreed to, by a letter that reached me on my arrival at York, and the firſt week in June I was to attend the Haymarket theatre.</p>
            <p>What made Mr. Foote ſo very generous, open, and explicit, was, that he judged it would be lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative to him if he complied as to terms.</p>
            <p>So it plainly appears that a war of five years was amicably and honourably concluded, with a peace not inglorious, but equitably adjuſted for the advantage of both parties, and from that time not any bickerings or breach of treaties happened between us to the time of his death, in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn ſeaſon 1777.—Peace to his manes! His entertaining qualities and univerſality of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and aſtoniſhing genius are too well known, eſtabliſhed, and acknowledged, to need any eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums from my weak abilities. He was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out virtues, though he had thoſe foibles and faults to which human nature is too ſubject.—So Foote farewell—<q>

            <p>From Norwich I took a trip to York, where I had never been, and entered into a treaty with Mr.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0593400203:135"/>
Baker for ſix nights. Mr. Baker was the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I named as manager of the York theatre, with whom I had previouſly formed an intimate acquaintance, as before-mentioned, at Mrs. Wier's, in the autumn 1758.</p>
            <p>As my Norwich engagement finiſhed on Sunday April the 16th, I intended quitting that place on the Monday morning following; but as I had grown rich, I at that time was wonderfully prudent, and determined on a ſaving ſcheme: So I gave up all idea of travelling ſo far as York, and lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the way in a poſt-chaiſe. Therefore the only prudent method was to go in the Monday morning's coach as far as Newmarket, but I could not be permitted to take a place for half way, unleſs they were left empty for want of London paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; which was and is, I believe, ſtill the conſtant cuſtom. I was called up early on the Monday morning to be ready for the coach; but judge my diſappointment and chagrin, when on my approach I found it chuck-full, as is often ſaid at the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre. What was to be done? A poſt-chaiſe I could not think of, on account of the charge:—There was no time allowed for conſideration, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll was prepared and ready at the Maid's Head for inſtant procedure. I determined to leave Norwich moſt triumphantly, and at an eaſy expence—two points not always in the power of us mortals—by

exalting myſelf on the coach-box; a ſituation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was as unfit for as the undertaking to ride o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> horſes at the Royal Grove:—But previouſly I had petitioned, reaſoned, urged, and intreated, but all to no effect; I could not make any impreſſion on the obdurate ſouls, who, proud and ſulky, kept eaſy and firm poſſeſſion of their ſeats, and hardly deigned to anſwer when I requeſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be ſqueezed in, but could not ſoften their hard hearts: and under the roſe be it ſpoken, no hearts are harder than thoſe of travellers in ſtage coaches, diligences, &amp;c. and not without ſome reaſon; for if not guarded by hearts of ſteel, it would, with the conjoined intereſt of inn-keepers and poſt-boys, be a perpetual tax upon our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures, our convenience, and our pockets, as we ſhould pay for what we did not poſſeſs. However, the inſide paſſengers on that occaſion called aloud on Mr. Whip to drive on; ſo my trunks, &amp;c. were left in the baſket, and I was hoiſted on the coach-box as the only alternative: but on the firſt movement of the vehicle, if it had not been for the arm of the coachman, I ſhould have been inſtantly under the wheels in the ſtreet, as I had not the leaſt notion how to keep my ſeat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> therefore the enraged travellers were under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of once more being detained till I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the help of the hoſtler and ſervants o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the inn, who were there and full ready to aſſiſt: I was received into their arms from the coach-box, and chucked into the baſket as a place of more ſafety, though not of eaſe or comfort, where I ſuffered moſt ſeverely from the jolting, particularly over the ſtones; it was moſt truly dreadful, and made me ſuffer almoſt equal to the ſea-ſickneſs I had experienced on board the pacquet in a ſtorm: however, as I had lived well at Norwich, the coach emetic did me no harm.</p>
            <p>The ſtage coaches then were not hung on ſprings as they are at preſent, nor were the roads near ſo good:—The coach was then double the time in performing the journey. We arrived at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market, where, though I produced myſelf as an outſide paſſenger, I was permitted the honour of being treated at table as an inſide gueſt; for they all knew me and pitied my ſituation, but naturally preferred my ſuffering ſome torment, rather than being miſerably ſtowed themſelves by cramming the vehicle as if loaded with Norwich turkies at Chriſtmas, and that merely to accommodate a ſtranger. We of the coach all ſupped together, ſeparated for bed, wiſhed each other a good night, with pleaſant and ſafe journies to our different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinations; they to London, myſelf to croſs the country till I got to the great North road.—On inquiry I was informed a ſtage croſſed from
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0593400203:138"/>
either Ipſwich or Bury (I forget which) the next day about twelve, which I determined to wait for; and I conceived it a matter of pleaſing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for it had a delightful convenience as to the hour of its coming, as it allowed me a long time to reſt before it arrived. After I had break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted on Tueſday the coach ſtopped, and from out of it, to my infinite mortification, came no leſs than ſix paſſengers; therefore I thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ringing the bell and having immediate recourſe to the agreeable though expenſive poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiſe; but on inquiry one of the perſons had only taken a place to Newmarket, in order to be in readineſs for the next Norwich coach to London. So after an hour's baiting for the gueſts and horſes, we took poſſeſſion of the vehicle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſlowly, and arrived about three o'clock at Cambridge; where finding not any other carriage croſſed on to the North road, I ſat myſelf down at the inn (a very indifferent one) and ordered whatever was ready to be produced for my imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate dinner.</p>

So far the reader may ſuppoſe I am not adhering to truth, when I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we were two days in going from Stamford to York; but in the year 1763, the roads were ſo bad at particular ſeaſons of the year, that they were for want of proper forming almoſt impaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and it has been known in the winter to have been eight or ten days journey from York to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. At that time it was not ſo familiar as it now is for ladies and gentlemen to fly like air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balloons, from the fartheſt points of eaſt and weſt, and from north to ſouth.

            <p>Saturday, April 23, 1763, Romeo and Juliet, with the Frenchified Lady never in Paris, was plaiſtered on the walls, for the benefit of Mr. Buck.

            <p>Mr. Foote mentioned our appearing together in the piece of the Minor: for ſaid he, the public w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eed I have often thought that admirable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Othello, would be better for the actor if not ſo inceſſantly in ſight; more pity and leſs fatigue to the performer would have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, had Shakeſpear ſo contrived; but his writings are ſo noble, wonderful, and natural, that I do not approve of the liberty I have taken, but will remove my remark more ſtrongly upon my favourite character of Zanga; which is finely drawn, and a charming part for the actor, but is much hurt by his beginning and ending almoſt every act of the play; and though it muſt be granted the poetry is fine, yet as it owes its beauties to the production of art, not that of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0593400203:152"/>
nature, it makes the Revenge a heavy, laborious, tireſome play, though Alonzo, Carlos, Zanga, and Leonora, are all good parts for the performers; Zanga particularly ſo.</p>
            <p>Well, I muſt return to Mr. Foote, with whom I dined, and it was agreed, the Minor ſhould be the opening piece, early in June 1763: Shift and Squintum, Mr. Wilkinſon;—Mrs. Cole and Smirk, Mr. Foote;—with the new farce of the Mayor of Garratt. My Shift, with the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was extravagantly well received, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſeveral nights.—The Mayor of Garratt had great ſucceſs, and a run of almoſt every night in the ſeaſon; it met with ſome oppoſition, which in general only gives a whet to the appetite of thoſe who chuſe to approve and ſupport.</p>
            <p>Peter Primmer, I dreſſed with an old tye-wig, like the Barber's in the Upholſterer, a long band neckcloth, a large rod in my right hand, and a Scotch plaid night gown, and had ſix boys with primmers and rods, and ſix girls with horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books, as my attendants in proceſſion, as the candidate for being choſen Mayor of Garratt. My likeneſs was ſtrong, and it was well taken; and as a ſchoolmaſter at Garratt near Wandſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, the dreſs was ridiculous, and not totally improper; but as a reſemblance of Mr. Sheridan,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0593400203:153"/>
who always appeared at his lecture, and every where as a gentleman my being <hi>too comical</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the effect; therefore it was judged much better to anſwer the purpoſe intended, to dreſs it in black, and a bag-wig, &amp;c. That alteration gave the people a ſtrong conception of him they knew; whereas the ridiculous wig and gown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed every part of the imitation by the abſurd appearance. The part I have entirely forgot, and only remember it concluded with my ſpeaking the following verſes, as an ode from the old horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe ſong of Nancy Dawſon.<q>

This, if you are a theatrical reader, I beg you will notice was the very winter Woodward had broke his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection as manager with Barry, and had ſpoken his prologue, of the Prodigal returned at London, and had been received with open arms, at his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſidence of Elyſium. That Prologue, if I had properly conſidered, certainly was a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and wanton undertaking, and therefore ſhould have required thought, as it indubitably might have drawn me into a predicament which, if taken of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively, might to a certainty have turned out ſo ſerious, that all my friends combined, could not have extricated me from the bad conſequences, as offence is ſooner conceived than forgiven; and too many people like being offended to gratify, by ſuch opportunity, their darling ſpleen and ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and even acquaintances are liable to ſway with the opinion of the multitude to prove thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

London, on looking over the Dublin Journal, he to his aſtoniſhment had ſeen his Prodigal prologue advertiſed to be ſpoken by Mr. Wilkinſon, and in his manner:—That he expected and requeſted to have that part of the bill expunged, as it might greatly injure him, and he alſo judged it a ſervice of danger to Mr. Wilkinſon:—He made a point of it the more as he intended (he added) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a few nights in the ſpring on his own ſtage in Crow-ſtreet, and he feared Mr. Wilkinſon's whim might have a perilous tendency. I felt the force of truth, and not meaning injury, ſhould have been unhappy to have occaſioned any.

Be it obſerved, that Mr. Woodward, when he ſpoke that prologue firſt at Covent Garden, after an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a few years, popped his head on the ſtage from the door, drew himſelf haſtily away as if aſhamed of being ſuch a prodigal ſon as to leave his good friends and not know when he was well. He next crept on by the curtain, peeping, and then hiding his face again till he attained the centre of the ſtage, which was wittingly conceived, and had a happy effect. So on my approach that night I practiſed the ſame manoeuvre, but as in imitation of Woodward, and not owing to my own bright thought: The audience on my firſt approach, and drawing back as above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,

For though he might be right in ſound judgment to return to London, he could eaſily have ſtudied means to have paid court, and obtained pardon and ſupport on his going back to the ſtation where he had formerly been for many years an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed favourite, without inconſiderately and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully

have been in a very indifferent dreſs; yet they wiſhed me to ſpeak it with a ſtuffed belly, roſy cheeks, and in a great pair of French boots: No remonſtrances would avail—I urged my boots as an excuſe, but they only laughed aloud and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Never mind, Major, ſpeak it in your boots."</q>—I thought ſome planet had unwitted men—I was obliged to ſubmit, and was ſo far in character (as the Prodiga) that I felt more inclined to cry than laugh. After that diſagreeable ceremony the farce proceeded on, was highly received, and acted ſix or ſeven nights, but never without their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite prologue, let me have acted what I would; nay, had I played Lady Townly or Juliet, I am certain I muſt have ſpoke it.

            <p>Mr. Woodward went over to Ireland late in the ſpring ſeaſon 1764:—he was advertiſed to play; and, to ſecure his former footing, his firſt appearance was announced for a public charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; when a rumour was whiſpered, and of courſe ſoon circulated, about Mr. Woodward's prodigal prologue, ſpoken in London at Covent Garden theatre, and ſo often repeated by Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the audience in Dublin during the winter months of playing. It may be readily conje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured that fooliſh buſineſs was not a little puſhed forwards by the oppoſite intereſts connected with the Moſſopian theatre; and actors can, in ſpite of nature, now and then give a lift to irritation and ſpleen in public taverns, &amp;c. particularly if things are not agreeable to themſelves at the time. Not but there are as worthy and ſuperior minds of both ſexes to be found in a theatre as in any other ſet of people whatever: but when we judge in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0593400203:208"/>
of mankind, wo be to the ſafety of thoſe who truſt their ſecurity, in the ſtate of reliance, on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, honour, and good-nature:—though it is ſaid charity covereth a multitude of ſins, yet Woodward's coat of mail and merit on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would not avail; it was not only penetrable ſtuff, but furiouſly threatened with aſſaſſination on all ſides, as they judged it a flimſy pretext to hide or conceal a conſcientiouſneſs of his fault, and a groſs affront to the city of Dublin at large.</p>
            <p>The playing for a charity for his firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, was a poor ſubterfuge, and made bad worſe, as they all knew his real view and intent was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; they therefore termed that a paltry evaſion, and a tacit confeſſion of guilt and fear, and on the day of his intended performance, the ſaid prologue was actually printed as ſpoken by the <hi>grateful</hi> Henry Woodward; therefore all the lines they had noted when I ſpoke it, they locked ſafe in the volumes of their brains, and ſuch as they took to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and affrontive were marked in the freſh print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones in Italics—here <hi>potatoes,</hi> another line <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips,</hi> and at laſt <hi>baniſhed from thoſe boards.</hi>—The matter wore ſo ſerious an aſpect, that Mr. Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and his friends thought it prudent and adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for him to decline playing there that night, or any other; on that he ſpeedily retreated, not making his appearance even in the ſtreets for fear of being
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0593400203:209"/>
inſulted, nor did he ever viſit Ireland to play again.</p>
            <p>I am vexed at relating this, becauſe it was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a fooliſh wantonneſs on my part, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with perplexity and vexation to myſelf, and followed with ſuch ſerious conſequences to Mr. Woodward, as never could have entered my head.—It hurt me the more, as I really regarded him much:—it occaſioned a great coolneſs and ironical diſtance between us for an interval, which was natural and unavoidable: But reflection and time made us reconciled, and reſtored us not only to our former acquaintance, but to a much ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger intimacy than before, and a ſincere friendſhip which truly continued till that moment which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates king and people, huſband and wife, father and ſon—and all the world.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woodward was a gentleman of true worth, and not undeſerving the ſigh of any perſon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exalted, as he undoubtedly was an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able member of ſociety, and an actor, while within memory, whoſe merits cannot, <hi>muſt not,</hi> be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: His Marplot, Bobadil, and Flaſh, will be for years enrolled in ſtage hiſtory.</p>
            <p>I now muſt travel to Donogadee, and from thence to Edinburgh; but I was obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue three or four days, the wind not anſwering directly for Scottiſh ſteerage—the diſtance I gueſs

Mrs. Bellamy was there, with whom I had not only dined at Mr. Calcraft's, when ſhe lived in Parliament-ſtreet, but had been on an intimacy for years by ſeeing her conſtantly as a viſitor at Lady Tyrawley's, at Somerſet-Houſe, near the Savoy, who regarded Mrs: Bellamy much as a ſuppoſed natural daughter of Lord Tyrawley's, though his Lordſhip had proved a falſe mate to his wedded lady; who, though a woman of high ſenſe and breeding could not boaſt of any perſonal attraction, as ſhe was ſhort-ſighted, ſquinted, and was in her perſon rather bordering on the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of caricature, but was friendly, generous, ſenſible, and humane, and ever honoured my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother as a conſtant kind companion and good neighbour.

            <p>Mrs. Mozeen, whom I believe I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as being a favourite actreſs at Portſmouth in 1758, was at Edinburgh 1764, under the wings of a long tall Northumberland manager of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, whoſe name was <hi>Dowſon,</hi> cojointly with a Mr. Bates.

                  <l>The leaſt wanton word; wou'd you believe it? &amp;c.</l>
               </q> And ſo it was with that lady; for at the leaſt ſudden joke ſhe bluſhed to ſuch a degree as to give the beholder pain for an offence not meant or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>A Miſs Wordly alſo was there, whom Mrs. Bellamy has mentioned in her apology as being termed the <hi>Goddeſs of Nonſenſe,</hi> as a compliment to her being remarkably the contrary: But there my friend Bellamy forgot herſelf, as indeed ſhe often tripped with her memory, for Miſs Wordly was called the <hi>Goddeſs of Nonſenſe</hi> by acting that part for my benefit in a farce of Fielding's, entitled, The Pleaſures of the Town, and was ſo chriſtened by Mr. Aickin, who was then in Edinburgh, in high and deſerved eſtimation, and with whom I had the ſatisfaction of <hi>many, many</hi> happy days, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evenings, (not omitting our Scotch pint of claret, and neither of us averſe to Madeira—to the latt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I could have propheſied he would, from his ſpirited manner then, have been more fortunate, if properly ſupported, on his firſt onſet in London in an animated and lively line; but it
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0593400203:218"/>
may be better as it is, for he is now playing what he might at this time have had to ſtudy; as years will creep (which neither Aickin nor Wilkinſon can prevent); therefore it makes his preſent time the more eaſy and pleaſant, and <q rend="inline">"All is well that ends well,"</q> is a good motto for us ſtage players.</p>
            <p>The third day of my being in Edinburgh I had a card of invitation from Mr. Dowſon and Mr. David Bates, managers, to ſup with them at a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern: I was entertained very reſpectfully; and in the courſe of caſual converſation Mr. Dowſon (who was the monied manager juſt then) aſked me what terms I required for eight or ten nights! ſaid, they could not afford any thing extravagant, as I had come uninvited (which ſhould never be done) and at the very prime part of the ſeaſon when they wanted not any foreign aid: Beſides, Mr Dowſon ſaid, (and with truth) Mr. and Mrs. Bellamy were towers of ſtrength. I eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by that converſation they meant to be very courtier-like and civil, but wanted not any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gangement that was likely to coſt them any thing. I found I had undertaken an expenſive tedious journey, merely on ſpeculation, and condemned myſelf as having acted wrong in ſo doing, and really thought I might as well have been lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively paid at that time by Mr. Barry, who had had me at his bedſide requeſting me to ſtay a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0593400203:219"/>
month longer in Dublin, even though I had been made to ſpeak Woodward's prologue againſt the grain; for Mr. Barry then wanted every aſſiſtance, he being confined by a rheumatiſm few perſons experienced equally painful as himſelf. The Scotch managers and I parted very civilly, but no hint of terms for an engagement on either ſide:—The day following at dinner with Mr. Digges, or Mr. Bellamy—which ever appellation the reader likes beſt,—I informed him and his lady what had paſſed, and that it had determined me to quit Scotland immediately. Mrs. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy replied, that what the managers had told me was the exact ſtate of facts as they then ſtood: <q rend="inline">"And," ſaid ſhe, "as Mr. Bellamy and myſelf are concerned in the <hi>profits</hi> in one inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and as we ſettle all the plays, we do not want you Mr. Wilkinſon, as it is evident you have thrown yourſelf into their power if you play at all; and if not, you have no alternative but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and make better uſe of your time, as you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly can; for Bates and Dowſon undoubtedly think as you are on the ſpot you will not neglect any decent engagement. But, my friend Tate," continued ſhe, "you are ſure I wiſh you well from my long knowledge of you; and if you will for once depend on my advice, and ſtay over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday or Monday next, a wonderful change may
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0593400203:220"/>
happen in the movements of the theatrical ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine that will aſtoniſh Bates and Dowſon, and you may command your own terms; at preſent they are ſure they can do without you, but Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next will cauſe a contrary opinion." I was much ſurpriſed, and begged Mrs. Bellamy to be explicit. "Why," ſaid ſhe, "Tate, I will prove myſelf explicit and honourable to you, as I can rely on your ſecrecy:—There is a law in force in Scotland, that if any perſon whatever is in debt, and known to be quitting the kingdom, they can arreſt, even on a Sunday, on oath being firſt made. Mr. Digges is much involved here, and is ſo unfortunately circumſtanced at this juncture that he cannot poſſibly continue longer, without loſs of liberty.—On Saturday night Mr. Digges will, on ſome pretext, get all the caſh he can from Mr. Still the treaſurer:—Dowſon is not deſtitute of property, and muſt pay the actors:—Mr. Digges will by Sunday night be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and ſecurely conveyed out of their reach, and ſafe on the other ſide the Tweed, in Old England:—On Monday Bates and Dowſon will be in the utmoſt conſternation, and their only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief will be that of requeſting your aſſiſtance."</q>—The event turned out exactly as Mrs. Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's ſecret advice had painted; and on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied Monday they were obliged to offer me
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0593400203:221"/>
unaſked, two clear benefits, who a week before would not have given one without the charges being duly paid into their coffers inſtead of my purſe.</p>
            <p>The Minor was firſt reſolved on; next the Mayor of Garratt; both were quite new.—Mrs. Cole was rather thought improper, alſo Dr. Squin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, as touching on matters there judged too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:—but I was very faſhionable, and all was right; but Major Sturgeon was the favourite.—I acted in various plays and farces, from Richard, Bayes, &amp;c. to the Lyar; in ſhort I played many good parts, and was received with candour and much approbation. Mrs. Bellamy had two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and both much honoured in the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they paid her on thoſe nights.—Her firſt was the Funeral:—I acted Trim; Mrs. Bellamy, Lady Brumpton; Campley, Mr. Aickin.—Her ſecond night was the Orphan of China: Zamti, Mr. Wilkinſon; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tan, Mr. Aickin; Mandane, Mrs. Bellamy: Hamet was to have been acted by Mr. Collins, who has given the public at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and elſewhere, much entertainment by his Bruſh; he was taken ill, and the part was obliged to be ſubſtituted by Mr. Creſwick's good-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly reading that character. The accident not only hurt the play but Mr. Collins, as Mrs. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy, in an acrimonious apology and manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0593400203:222"/>
to the audience that Mr. Collins pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely diſtreſſed the repreſentation, and in plain terms told them nought but malevolence and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour was the true cauſe of the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have no reaſon to imagine her accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was truly or ill-founded, but that was the colour ſhe gave it; and becauſe frequent illneſs, ſudden and laſting, we are all ſubject to.</p>
            <p>I was ſoon well acquainted with ſeveral leading gentlemen, particularly with Mr. Nicholſon Swetart, who was then univerſally known, and as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered from London to Edinburgh, and at every public place of reſort, as any worthy ſpirited gentleman can be, and in conſequence reſpected in the three kingdoms:—He poſſeſſed liberality and that goodneſs of heart (above all to be recorded) which many may envy, but few, very few, can equal, and felt the dramatic furor in a degree, like Mr. Vapid, not to be ſurpaſſed; which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as no diſhonour to himſelf as an admirer of Shakſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re and Garrick, but to his own fame as a mind full of liberality and underſtanding, and pay only a juſt tribute in ſuch declaration.</p>
            <p>My days and hours at that period were very happily engaged, and always, when not with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, was certain of an agreeable party with Mrs. Bellamy. My obligations at Edinburgh were extended beyond mediocrity, and in the courſe of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0593400203:223"/>
my repeated viſits to that city exceed the limits of expreſſing a proper acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>My firſt benefit there, was on the 14th of March, 176<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>:—The Way to keep him; Tragedy A-la-Mode; Bucks have at ye All; with Duke and no Duke: Lovemore, Trapolin, &amp;c. by Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon; Widow Belmour, Mrs. Bellamy.</p>
            <p>My ſecond (the laſt night of the ſeaſon) I act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King Lear, and had the farce of the Pleaſures of the Town, aided by Miſs Wordly's Goddeſs of Nonſenſe. I was not only ſatisfied, but even delighted with my expedition to Canny Edinburgh; and indeed, from my frequent viſits to that place, has occurred the moſt enviable and pleaſing conſequences, which on reflection muſt ever be delightful to my memory; ſuch as renewing my acquaintance there, which repaid my journies with every agreeable advantage, an increaſe of friends, a kind reception, great and honourable benefits freely attended to, with many high-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed compliments, which has left behind an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible mark of gratitude on my heart that no filer or artiſt can ever deface, only the ſlow and ſure hand of Time that moulders even matters of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude to aſhes and duſt.</p>
            <p>The Edinburgh ſeaſon ended: Mrs. Bellamy wiſhed me to proceed on an expedition then form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a new theatre at Glaſgow juſt finiſhed,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0593400203:224"/>
but I at that time was in a bad ſtate of health and therefore declined it; as, added to indiſpoſition, I wiſhed once more to review my London apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I had not had the opportunity of ſeeing from the time of my mother's death, and where all the furniture, clothes, &amp;c. were ſafely and honourably ſecured by the undoubted care and regard of Mrs. Alcock in Little Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet in the Strand, and of courſe I had ſome matters of buſineſs to ſettle: Indeed I grew worſe and worſe in health, and, on leaving Edinburgh, by ſlow ſtages, like Cardinal Wolſey, (chooſing a great compariſon) expected juſt to reach London and die in earneſt on my late mother's bed.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Bellamy and the company had ſet off for the weſt of Scotland, Glaſgow—I ſet off South for my deſtined home, but intended to halt at my good friend's, Mr. Baker of the York theatre.—I was ſo very ill, that five or ſix days were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, even with difficulty, to accompliſh the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. When the afflictive <hi>tour</hi> was achieved, I at noon found that good old gentleman buſy with bricks and mortar, and in his high glory, giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to workmen who were erecting <hi>part</hi> of a new theatre at York, at a great, and his ſole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: It was intended to be (as it now actually is) on a much more capacious ſcale than the old one, though nearly on the ſame ſpot, as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was then
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0593400203:225"/>
finiſhing the tail of the new, while the players were employed in the head of the old. Mr. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker laughed on ſeeing me, and exulted on valuing himſelf the younger man in point of compariſon, I was ſo emaciated; which, joking a-part, he was ſeriouſly ſorry to behold.</p>
            <p>That night was the firſt benefit a Mr. and Mrs. Powell had at York—The Merchant of Venice; in which Mr. Powell acted Gratiano, and Mrs. Powell, Portia.—Mr. Powell was a York man—Mrs. Powell a woman of a good and reſpectable family in Warwickſhire. Mr. Baker requeſted me much to rouſe my ſpirits and play a few nights. As I ever was ready to graſp at a benefit and be touching the caſh, to prevent running out, and did not diſlike the fatigue of playing: I conſented, and on Saturday, April 28, fixed on Othello for my opening character:—It was to have been for the benefit of Mrs. Quin. I was daily abuſed at York for attempting Mr. Frodſham's part of Othello. When the day came, I was after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner taken ſo dreadfully ill, that I never expected to play more. Mr. Frodſham was not to be found to ſupply my place, and the audience were obliged to be diſmiſſed; and as the world is too fond of any tale that feeds its appetite for ſcandal, however groſs, abſurd, and even impoſſible, ſo in that inſtance did I ſuffer moſt inhumanly by the falſehoods
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0593400203:226"/>
propagated, reliſhed, and believed, without a trait of truth to lead to the matter. Firſt, it was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted I was afraid to appear, conſcious of my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving picked their pockets at York on my Tea benefit the year before; next, that Mr. Baker and I had drank half pints of rum and wine till we were ſo int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xicated, that both were carried to bed ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; nay, the matter was carried ſo far, that I had a letter of condolance from Mr. Foote la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and reproaching me for having been drove from the York ſtage for attempting to play when ſo infamouſly drunk that I could neither ſpeak nor ſtand. So theſe different tales of ſcandal were all ſent piping hot north, ſouth, eaſt, and weſt, and the ſimple matter of fact was neither more nor leſs than my being truly and dangerouſly ill So, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of pity, I heard of nothing but reproach, ſpite, unmerited abuſe, and malevolence. But as we who live to pleaſe muſt pleaſe to live—I conſoled myſelf when I heard ſuch rabble-like opinion with the idea of Coriolanus—<q>
                  <l>Ye common cry of curs, whoſe breaths I did</l>
                  <l>Deſpiſe as reek o' the rotten fens,</l>
                  <l>Whoſe loves I priz'd as the dead carcaſe of</l>
                  <l>Unburied men, that did corrupt my air.</l>
               </q> At preſent I have the honour to know a few ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect friends, good and capable to ſerve myſelf and family, and to make us happy; and that is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0593400203:227"/>
               <hi>every one</hi> cannot boaſt—And every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flective mind ſhould obſerve, that acrimonious and corroſive diſpoſitions are ſuch, that, having in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no ſhare in Nature's bounties, conſequently they feel no pity towards ſuch as have them.</p>
            <p>On the Monday at York, 1764, though my illneſs was very little abated, in ſpite of abuſe, and in ſpite of prudence, (having naturally at times a touch of the head-ſtrong) I perſiſted in being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced for Major Sturgeon on the Tueſday, May 1, 1764. Several perſons called at Mr. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's deſiring me not to play, for I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be inſulted; urging alſo, that my ſtate of health made it wrong to attempt it: However, on that ſaid appointed Tueſday, I preſented myſelf in Major Sturgeon, when on my entrance the wrongs the audience had ſuſtained (as they termed it) by their patience and forbearance the year before, and ſuch inſolence added to drunkenneſs none but ſuch good tempers would have permitted, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an univerſal hiſs, with two or three <hi>un</hi>civil oranges burſt at once on my devoted head. I was ſuperior to making an apology, or offering an explanation, when ſo unjuſtifiably and cruelly treated: So I marched and counter-marched as the Major, though ſcarcely able to bear the weight of my boots, and was hiſſed throughout that act, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0593400203:228"/>
at my exit received every mark of diſgrace.—What I got for my labour the next day was, that I need not think of playing Major Sturgeon after Mr. Achurch, as he performed it ſo much better; and they wondered, as I acted at York again, I did not aſk pardon for my inſults to that public.</p>
            <p>It is no more ſtrange than true, though all this vexed and truly mortified me, yet it rouſed my ſpirits in part from that languor my bad ſtate of health had thrown me into, as I really did not expect I ſhould have remained long in this world, but ſoon ſhut out day-light.</p>
            <p>The Spring Meeting was for the ſecond trial that year, on May the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th—I acted on Saturday the 5th, Bajazet, and the Orators, for Old Tenoe's benefit: Very little approbation, nor many marks of the contrary;—their ſtony hearts began to relent and ſoften, and my love of acting, though il<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, was very different to my preſent feelings, for I am now truly grown weary and old with ſervice, though more weary than old and incapable.—I was ſo weak at that time, that at the end of each play I fainted repeatedly from ſickneſs and lack of ſtrength, yet would not give it up, but kept acting away.</p>
            <p>In the May Meeting I performed Oakley, and the Apprentice, which in Dublin had pleaſed ſo much; but I was unfortunately at York much
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0593400203:229"/>
diſapproved—I was ſhocking after Frodſham in Dick.</p>
            <p>May 9,—Kitely, and Cadwallader in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.—That night I was received into favour:—Several gentlemen deſired I would play the Major once more, and they would ſupport me in it:—I was well received as the Major.</p>
            <p>May 10,—The Author was repeated, and I ſeemed reſtored to their grace—If applauſe was to fix opinion on that matter.</p>
            <p>My Major Sturgeon gained ſuch ground the ſecond time, May 11, and ſo contrary from my firſt night's impreſſion, that the late Colonel Thornton, then commander of the York militia, beſpoke my play, but particularly deſired the Mayor of Garratt. The Colonel requeſted I would paſs an hour with him on that occaſion over a bottle at Howard's (now Ringroſe's) a few days before my benefit; and the York rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will allow me to be weak in body, as I could not crawl ſo far without a chair, though in the month of May on a fine day, and the diſtance a few yards only.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday was my benefit, by deſire of Col. Thornton.—The Funeral, with the Mayor of Garratt, &amp;c.—and I was, contrary to my expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, favoured with great boxes and a very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel houſe, though not crammed as the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0593400203:230"/>
the receipt was 50 l. I parted with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and was on a much better footing with the public on my departure than the year before, when I left York, after a more ſuperabundant benefit. The viciſſitudes of life are ſtrange, and ſometimes misfortunes paſt are ſtories of delight.</p>
            <p>While at York I received a letter from Mrs. Bellamy, congratulating me on my good fortune in not going with the company to Glaſgow; for after the firſt night of performance the metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts had burſt in and wilfully ſet fire to the theatre, which conflagration had conſumed every part of the ſtage, with all her wardrobe and wearing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, except what was on her back; and that the wardrobe of the theatre had ſuſtained the ſame fate. I was ſo far conſoled by the accident, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf two hundred and forty miles nearer London than I ſhould have been at Glaſgow, as to return thanks for my lucky eſcape; and rejoiced to find, though I was at York and had got into the frying-pan, I had jumped away from the fire.—Theſe are Mrs. Bellamy's words:— <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <p>"The next day at noon we ſaw the delightful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0593400203:231"/>
to greater advantage, elated my heart; and I anticipated the pleaſure I ſhould have in being received by friends, who were not only moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial in their repeated invitations, but whoſe opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence furniſhed them with power to fulfil their warm promiſes of ſupport."</p>
                  <p>"When we arrived at Glaſgow, one of the performers exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Madam, you are ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for you have nothing left but what you have with you in the chaiſes."</q> I am at loſs, even now, to account for the compoſure with which I heard this alarming ſalutation. I was informed that the ſtage of the new theatre had been ſet on fire the night before, and that all my paraphernalia and wardrobe, which lay there unpacked, had been conſumed by the flames."</p> 
                  <p>"The conflagration, I found, was occaſioned by the following circumſtance: A methodiſt teacher, who held forth in that city, told his auditors, that he dreamed the preceding night of being in the infernal regions at a grand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, where all the devils in hell were preſent; when Lucifer, their chief, gave for a toaſt, <q rend="inline">"The health of Mr.—, who had ſold his ground to build him a houſe upon, (meaning the theatre) and which was to be opened the next day for them all to reign in."</q>—
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0593400203:232"/>
"The poor, ignorant, enthuſiaſtic hearers of this <hi>godly</hi> preacher found their enmity againſt Satan and his ſubjects inſtantly inflamed by this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, and in order to prevent ſo alarming an extention of his infernal majeſty's empire, they haſtened away in a body to the new-built play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and ſet the ſtage on fire. Luckily the flames were extinguiſhed before any other part of the theatre was conſumed, but the whole of my theatrical wardrobe, which lay in the packages upon it, were deſtroyed. It appeared that this religious mob had been joined by others, who wiſhed to take advantage of the conflagration: as a great deal of the falſe trumpery upon the regalia of the mock kings and queens had been taken away, and being found of no great value, lay ſcattered about the fields. As the theatre was a mile from the city, and the flames did not burſt out ſo as to become viſible, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries completed their deſign, and ſilently retired. No alarm was therefore given, nor our loſs known till the next morning."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I left York, but inſtead of attending to my health, and proceeding, as I ought to have done, to London, I took as good a round-about way to the ſouth as poſſible, by croſſing to the weſt: I by ſlow ſtages ſet off for Mancheſter, where the fatigue of two days and a half in getting thither
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0593400203:233"/>
had overpowered me ſo much, that inſtead of ſleep I paſſed the night in agonies. I, however, crawled into the coach that went to Warrington in the morning, and from thence took poſt-chaiſe to Frodſham, a village in Cheſhire (where Frod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham the York actor was born), and from thence got once more to Dan Smith's at Cheſter:—Whitley's company was there, and that manager invited me to play four nights, and to give me the fifth: I could not reſiſt the temptation; and began with no leſs a difficult character than Richard the Third; the very rehearſal of which occaſioned my repeatedly fainting: However, I armed myſelf with no leſs than a bottle of Madeira, and went through beyond expectation at night. I acted Shylock, &amp;c. but never got to bed after playing without one or more fainting fits. Mr. Wilbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham intreated I would deſiſt, but I urged as I had gone through ſo much gratis, I would finiſh at all hazards, though I knew my life was at ſtake.—Mr. Didier a comedian (now fixed at Bath) was then at Cheſter—a friendly agreeable gentleman.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 22d of June, 1764, I finiſhed with my benefit, and acted Othello, and Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader in the Author; and after all the wilful dangerous labour I underwent, the receipt of the houſe was only 14l.—All my acquaintance ſaid I was rightly ſerved, being in a ſtate ſo very unfit

for ſuch an undertaking. I there received a letter from Mr. Foote, who was aſtoniſhed I neglected the Haymarket, and the ſeaſon ſo far advanced, not informing him my reaſons for not being in London at the expected ſeaſon; and more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to hear, by accident, that I was well he ſuppoſed, as the Cheſter paper had given him a clue to find where I was. I then informed him I would in a few days be with him, but feared I could neither aſſiſt him nor myſelf by appearing on the ſtage, I was ſo very incapable from ſevere ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In two or three days following I took a place at Cheſter in a coach that at that time went through Birmingham—I bid adieu to Mr. Smith and Mr. Wilberham, neither of whom I ever expected to ſee again; inſtead of that they are gone long ſince to reſt, and I am ſtill in this world living to relate their deaths.—But to keep up one's ſpirits and hope for the beſt, is not a bad preſcription in ſickneſs or in health; and it is to my aſtoniſhment, with grateful acknowledgments to Almighty God for his bleſſings, that here I am in tolerable health, not yet having ſwallowed the allotment of duſt, to which I am to return.</p>
            <p>In the coach were ſeated Madame Capdeville, (a principal dancer) with her mother: the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been for years a firſt dancer at Covent Garden theatre, but then returning from Ireland:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0593400203:235"/>
I was very much indiſpoſed and diſcompoſed with the journey, but both my fellow travellers were very kind and attentive to me. At broad noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the ladies deſired the coachman to ſtop, and having the door opened out they went in full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, and with the moſt perfect compoſure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a deed without a name in the middle of the road; but as it was ſummer, and duſty, the roads wanted watering: The John Bull of a coachman bluſhed and hung down his head; and ill as I was I could not refrain from the oddity of the whole groupe, being conſidered as viewing and not viewing the whimſical tranſaction—I need not add thoſe females were French, not Engliſh ladies. When the coach towards evening ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at Caſtle Bromage, I thought, while the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were drinking tea, I would attempt to walk a mile and let the coach overtake me; and in caſe of being enfeebled, as the evening was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, could ſtop at ſome ſtile or door till I could be relieved by the attending vehicle. I dragged myſelf on for near a mile, or perhaps more, when I halted, expecting ſuccour from the arrival of the carriage every minute, then endeavoured ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to proceed for fear of growing chilly; then I waited, then I walked, and that diſagreeable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament I ſuſtained till all my patience was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the contrary extreme; and, tottering like

               </gap> pain and uneaſineſs. It was ſome time before on the road I could meet a friendly cottage to give me information or a comfortable reſting-place; for, by the quick approach of night, my anxiety greatly increaſed: the firſt hut I ſaw I implored a hearing, and related my diſmal ſtory of waiting for the coach, &amp;c. and on reciting my ditty, and explaining my diſtreſſed ſituation, the good old woman of the cottage exclaimed—<q rend="inline">"O! good Sir, you are ſadly beſide your own ſen, for you are now on London coach road; coach is right weel at Brumugum ere this; ſo you mun croſs coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try like; you look perilous bad lſe ſure, and God ſend you well at Brumugum."</q> I then inquired, with aching heart, how far Birmingham was from thence? She ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Why a mun not mair than three or four miles <hi>like,</hi> only croſs country <hi>like.</hi>"</q> Now three or four computed miles by ſuch gueſſers generally turns out double the ground they mention, and to the ſtranger is treble:—He is perplexed at every turning, by not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he is right or wrong, and that was my ſituation, beſides my ſufferings from pain when I attempted to undertake to walk and explore my way to Birmingham:—and this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſo horrid, was all occaſioned by my having committed a blunder a child would have been
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0593400203:237"/>
whipped for, the want of common obſervation at the diviſion of the road, and the remedy very eaſy; for with patience and money in my purſe the firſt countryman for a ſhilling or ſo would have gone to the Welch Harp at Caſtle Bromage and ordered a poſt-chaiſe; and beſides my illneſs, all my luggage was in the coach, with caſh, clothes, &amp;c. which, without reſting a night, proceeded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for London.—However, in ſpite of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or ability, I determined on this walk to Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham with all my imperfections on my head. While the night was making quick approach to darkneſs, off I ſet and croſſed from place to place, ſometimes with intelligence, then not any to be had: I had boots on, and when I had conquered three or four miles, to add ſtill to my misfortune and miſery, my knee-buckle got looſe, dropped down my boot, and imperceptibly worked itſelf to the bottom, and at laſt got under the ſole of my foot, which occaſioned not only uneaſineſs, but very excruciating pain, to a degree not to be endured, and no poſſibility of relieving my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; and it frequently ſhifted in the walking, which cauſed increaſing and variety of torments: I actually ſhould have abandoned myſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and to the firſt dry ditch for my night's lodging (which then muſt have finiſhed me); but fortunately caſting up my eyes through the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0593400203:238"/>
gloomy duſk, I with a moſt pleaſing ſenſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the ſteeple of the new church at Birmingham, which I recollected with rapture; it gave a faint gleam of hope, and like a drowning man and the ſtraw, ſo did I in idea feed my hopes with the luxury of a feather-bed and a negus by twelve o'clock:—I was, however, as may naturally be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, much farther off my ſtation than I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;—but while there is life there are hopes. I could never have accompliſhed that event had not the perſpiration I underwent been ſo undeſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably violent, that I dared not ſtop a moment to ſuffer the winds of heaven to viſit my face too roughly; and at the ſame time, though over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered with weakneſs, I felt myſelf breathe eaſier, and the fever and hectic heat not ſo ſtrong as it uſually hung upon me. By twelve o'clock, thank God, I accompliſhed my ſurpriſing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, which had given me more pain, anxiety, trouble, and danger than ever the famous Powell encountered on his walks from London to York and back again. I ſoon after my arrival at Mr. Barber's, the Swan, got a ſtrong Madeira negus, and on inquiring was much pleaſed, and obliged to Madame Capdeville, who had kindly taken care to have all my luggage left ſafely under the protection of Mr. Barber; for her head, aided by the obſervation of the coachman, had ſuggeſted
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0593400203:239"/>
how my unfortunate blunder had happened, which prevented my having much trouble and inquiries: What had helped the matter was my having been a conſtant friend to Mr. Barber, the ſeaſon I have before-mentioned, being at Birmingham under the command of my friend Mr. Hull in 1762.</p>
            <p>I was weak the next day and could not get out of bed, but no fever, and the perſpiration ſtill continued immoderately. After three or four days I found myſelf recovering, and wiſhing to be in London, whether to live or die, I ordered a poſt-chaiſe, and in two days and a half got there, without being too much hurried, and received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by making the ſtages eaſy and ſuitable as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The old diſh of the Minor was in July ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for my firſt onſet, which Mr. Foote had not acted, but had deferred, (in the interim won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at my delay):—and the Minor not having been acted at either theatre from September 1763 till that time, gave it a degree of novelty. I was received that year as an old eſtabliſhed favourite of the town. The Haymarket ſtage was as eaſy as the York ſtage was when I had the uſe of my legs, and where I might be ſaid of late years to have been truly at home.</p>
            <p>Tragedy A-la-Mode was revived for Mr. Foote and myſelf to appear in: Mr. Project, Mr. Foote; the tragedy part all by me, and was often repeated with equal and uncommon applauſe. I increaſed highly in public favour, not only from the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent partiality of the audience, which in general accompanies ſuch performers as they honour with their good and golden opinion, but I was then particularly induſtrious, and acting was my only reſource for pleaſure:—My ſevere illneſs had alarmed me ſo much, that I lived ſtrictly regular. I was more collected, a material article for young or old actors to obſerve and follow; for though a man be uſed to wine and good dinners, and be perfectly clear and ſober in his room, yet the leaſt flurry or miſtake on the ſtage ſets that dinner and wine into a fume, and makes the brain feel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0593400203:241"/>
and confuſed; and no actor can be a good timeiſt on the ſtage unleſs he keeps himſelf cool and collected, and in good ſpirits of the pureſt kind, not beholden to the aſſiſtance of the grape: <q rend="inline">"O thou invincible ſpirit of wine! if thou haſt no name to be known by, let us call thee <hi>Devil.</hi>—To be now a ſenſible man, and by and by a fool, and preſently a beaſt—Every inordinate cup is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed, and the ingredient is a devil."</q>—The true refreſhment of the performer ſhould be from the fanning gales excited from the pleaſure of the audience, while the actor in return feels his heart glowing with rapture and gratitude.</p>
            <p>My health improved daily, and by acting with Mr. Foote I had ſeldom more ſtage exerciſe than what was of ſervice to me. The Apprentice was alſo revived, which I acted very often to a crowded theatre.—It was commanded by the Duke of York as a firſt piece, which occaſioned the only little diſpute that in the Haymarket theatre ever occurred between Mr. Foote and myſelf. His Royal Highneſs commanded it as a firſt piece, as he urged ſome very particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.—Mr. Foote appointed the Minor as the after piece, and I remonſtrated and indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

accuſtomed the audience to ſee; and if I did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame, the repetition of ſuch mimicry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being pleaſing, would be offenſive. Mr. Foote ſeemed much diſpleaſed, and even diſguſted, but yielded to my argument, and on that occaſion played Shift himſelf; there was no more diſpute about it, or was it ever mentioned again.</p>
            <p>We had one little ſparring-bout in the ſpring of 1771, which Mr. Woodward ſoon reconciled. I had acted (by having ſecretly obtained a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loined copy) his farce of the Devil upon Two Sticks; and after having committed the fault, and well knowing he would quickly hear of my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I, by way of preventing his anger, informed him of my invaſion on his property, thinking he would conſtrue it as a very good joke; but on the contrary he was really much irritated, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of poſt favoured me with the few following whimſical lines.<floatingText type="letter">

In 1764, to my part of the Apprentice in London, when acted as the after-piece, I was ever honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the continuance of the audience on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the four laſt lines, to which I never had leſs than four plaudits; for my imitations were not only good, but well planned for effect—and much depends on that: One ſpeech in a parody of different writing, would ſuit for the mimicry of one particular perſon, which, to imitate another, would ſeem all diſcordant, and out of time and place.—The laſt lines to the Apprentice were as follows, to which are affixed the names for thoſe who knew the actors of thoſe days, to judge how far they were applicable, or the contrary.<q>

            <p>Mr. Weſton was of great aſſiſtance in that farce by his inimitable acting of Simon.</p>
            <p>I requeſted Mrs. Rich, on my benefit, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me once more with letting me ride her hob-by-horſes, and give them a ſummer's airing, as they had not been rubbed down for a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month,

which ſhe kindly granted me, and I acted Bayes by univerſal deſire, and to a houſe much more crowded than the year before.—That truly excellent actor, Mr. Parſons, was then at Mr. Foote's theatre, and I think will remember my aſſertion to be, not a chimera of the brain, but a fact.</p>
            <p>From a love of caſh I performed five Saturdays for the ſixth to be clear, at the old theatre on Richmond Hill: Mr. Foote lent me his dreſſes, and my benefit was on Saturday, Auguſt 20, 1764, and was honoured with the ſanction of the Duke of York. Lady Peterſham and a large party were there, and I was favoured with a brilliant appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Moſt of the little pit was laid into the boxes.

            <p>Early in December, 1764, I ſet off for Exeter, where Mr. Jefferſon, my old friend and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Dublin and London, was then become the manager, and every thing promiſed moſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringly that he would ſoon make a fortune: But the ſubſtance is often changed for a ſhadow, nor are managers' gains ſo eaſily amaſſed as the public can gather it for them. His invitation had double allurement—firſt, <hi>novelty,</hi> which was ever prevalent; and next, to ſee ſo pleaſant and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man as he had ever proved to me—I joined him and his new troop—Mr. Jefferſon was at that time endeavouring (not without encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to bring that theatre into a regular and eſtabliſhed reputation—He had engaged Mr. Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, and many other good performers: Mrs. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon, his firſt wife, was then living; ſhe had one of the beſt diſpoſitions that ever harboured in a human breaſt; and, more extraordinary, joined to that meekneſs, ſhe was one of the moſt elegant women ever beheld.

At the time of my expedition to Exeter there exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that place a moſt eccentric genius and very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular character, Mr. Andrew Brice, a printer.—He was to a degree remarkable in manner, figure, and a thouſand peculiarities that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but had accumulated by art, genius, and lucky circumſtances, an independent fortune:—George Faulkener, of Dublin, was by no means ſuch an extraordinary being; beſides, Mr. Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kener, as a man of benevolent and good qualities, muſt ever be revered; but in the compariſon of goodneſs the rueful Andrew Brice ſhould not be mentioned.—Alluding to Andrew Brice gives me authority, from Mr. King himſelf, to inſert the following.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Garrick wrote the character of Lord Ogleby, it was before he went to Italy; but on his return, and once more engaging with the fatigues of his theatre, he relinquiſhed all thoughts of acting that part, telling Mr. King, for his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that he found his ſtate of health not equal to ſuſtain the run of a new play; and that if he himſelf ſhould play Lord Ogleby, it would lead into applications from authors to requeſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming in their pieces; to prevent which, he had come to a determination not to ſtudy any new character whatever, and deſired Mr. King would do the part—Mr. King begged to decline—Mr.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0593400203:255"/>
Garrick read it to that gentleman—The part he ſtill refuſed even to the fourth time, and deſired the part of Bruſh inſtead of Lord Ogleby.—Mr. Garrick ſtill continued preſſing, and Mr. King, fearing Mr. Garrick ſhould think him more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate than right, took the part to conſider of it, and by paying cloſe attention when locked up in his ſtudy, he accidentally repeated a few paſſages in a tremulous voice, which recurred to his ear as ſomething ſimilar to the ſound of old Andrew Brice's of Exeter:—He tried again and again, and found he had hit upon the very man as a natural and true picture to repreſent Lord Ogleby. Mr. King went to Mr. Garrick and privately rehearſed a ſcene—Garrick was all aſtoniſhed, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out, <q rend="inline">"By G—d, King, if you can but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain that fictitious manner and voice throughout, it will be one of the greateſt performances that ever adorned a Britiſh theatre."</q> Mr. Garrick's prophecy was verified, as Mr. King's manner of producing that character before the public was then, and is to this day, one of the moſt capital and highly-finiſhed pieces of acting with which any audience ever was treated, and will never be forgotten while a trait of Mr. King can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered. But, alas! the actor's fame, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever great, cannot be recollected many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0593400203:256"/>
the time he lived: for, ah me! as Garrick obſerved—<q>
                  <l>The painter dead, yet ſtill he charms the eye;</l>
                  <l>While England lives his fame can never die.</l>
                  <l>But he <hi>who ſtruts</hi> his hour upon the ſtage</l>
                  <l>Can ſcarce extend his fame for half an age:</l>
                  <l>Nor pen nor pencil can the actor ſave;</l>
                  <l>The art and artiſt ſhare one common grave.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Andrew Brice, in figure and tremulous manner, was exactly what Mr. King appears to be in Lord Ogleby; and I could have forgiven Brice had he painted like his Lordſhip: for he had ſo much of the lily in his complexion, that he looked (tho' one of the neateſt) the moſt corpſe-like Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine figure I ever beheld in the various productions of Human Nature.</p>
            <p>When I acted Bayes at Exeter, and ſpoke a ſpeech or two in his manner, it ſtruck the whole audience like electricity.—Mr. Jefferſon, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Johnſon, was ſo taken by the ſurpriſe, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e could not proceed for laughter.—He is now at Exeter, and will, I am certain, recollect and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate that circumſtance. My benefit, even at this diſtant time, demands my acknowledgement, it was ſo numerouſly attended. I ever think of Exeter with pleaſure; the country that ſurrounds that city is beautiful, and the air eſteemed more
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0593400203:257"/>
ſcrene and ſalubrious than almoſt any other part of the kingdom.—As a proof it is judged ſo, I have known families, who have been in bad health, ordered by Yorkſhire phyſicians to winter the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere months at Exeter, as the <hi>Montpelier</hi> of Great Britain:—Good eating abounds there, and the market produces an uncommon variety of articles, all in the higheſt perfection:—I was there in the winter, and in January the face of the country looked well, and produced a verdure not uſual at that inclement ſeaſon in other parts of England. I went from thence for two days with Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Plymouth; at the dock I met my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance Captain Scot of Cheſter—the ſituation ſeemed ſtriking, but I had not leiſure, nor was it a time of the year to judge of the proſpect of Mount Edgcumbe, &amp;c. to any fair advantage:—I took a peep at the theatre, though on a Sunday; it appeared very decent: Good theatres were not <hi>then</hi> ſo plenty in any county as at preſent; the flat ſcenes I remember moved on a principle I never ſaw either before or ſince; they puſhed up and down a groove in one ſtraight frame like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Before I finiſhed at Exeter I had the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invitations repeatedly from Meſſ. Dowſon and Bates at Edinburgh, intimating they could not go on without my immediate aſſiſtance—A pretty little trip the end of January from Exeter to Edinburgh!—However preliminaries were ſoon ſettled, and Mr. Jefferſon had behaved friendly, generouſly, politely, and attentively. I left him with my beſt wiſhes and proceeded to London, where I reſted only two or three days, and then poſted down for the north, ſtopped one day with Mr. Baker at York, ſaw the new theatre—broke down near Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham—t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

day. We got ſafe to the capital of Scotland.—The firſt night on the road thither we lay at Old Camus, which houſe I believe is now eraſed—from what cauſe I know not—it was ſaid to be haunted; and though I am not ſuperſtitious as to ſuch idle dreams and fictions of the brain, yet I muſt declare ſuch a noiſe I never heard in my life as during the night at that place. We reached Edinburgh the firſt week in February 1765: The theatre had ſuſtained the loſs of Mr. Digges and Mrs. Bellamy; the only true ſupport was Mr. Aickin: There was, it is true, a Mr. Stamper, who had been a great favourite, but he was grown quite inebriated, and that from <hi>morning</hi> drinking: The company was much the ſame, except Mr. Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Mr. Creſwick, a Mr. Parker and Mrs. Pye from Ireland; alſo Mr. and Mrs. M'George. We went on tolerably till Richard the Third was acted—a character at Edinburgh I was always particularly well received in, and with more than common applauſe; but during the ſummer ſeſſions in 1764 Mr. Sheridan had engaged for a certain number of nights, and on one of thoſe nights had acted Richard, at which time the want of a young gentleman or lady to ſupply the part of Prince Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, rendered it impracticable to have the play acted, unleſs Mrs. Mozeen, whoſe figure was neat and youthful, though bordering at that time on

the vale of years, would quit petticoat hopes, in Lady Anne, of royal coronation, and aſſume the young monarch in expectation of the ſame honours. But in the winter Mrs. Wheeler's daughters, who promiſed remarkably well on the ſtage, ſupplied the childrens' parts very ably Mrs. Mozeen expected her Lady Anne as her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ock part, and no ſuppoſition could be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded for Mrs. M'George's taking offence at it; for though ſhe had played Lady Anne with Mr. Sheridan in the ſummer ſeaſon, ſhe muſt have known it was neceſſity and good-nature in Mrs. Mozeen to have reſigned Lady Anne for Prince Edward on a matter of emergency: which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle being removed, and the children provided for the royal ſtock, ſhe had double claim to former rights But on the night Richard was acted, in the ſcene where Mrs. Mozeen in Lady Anne made her appearance, a general uproar enſued, aye even to the pelting of the lady; the collegians, one and all, having formed a ſevere party at the malevolent miſrepreſentations inſtigated by Mr. and Mrs. M'George, whoſe wrongs were related with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force to the town, as being cruelly deprived o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

a huſband, but Manager Dowſon having been alarmed by authenticated intelligence that miſchief was brewing, barricaded the entrances, and kept them double guarded by door-keepers, to prevent Roxana with her dagger from gaining ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance behind the ſcenes, and thereby wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the boſom of his beloved Statira. It was an hour before the uproar ceaſed; but Mrs. Mozeen evinced, if ſhe had a little body ſhe had a great ſoul.</p>
            <p>The audience were very attentive, and honoured me much that evening in every ſcene, except where Lady Anne made her appearance, and then marks of rage, indignation, and contempt enſued.—The riot did not ſubſide with that night, but laſted above a fortnight, and was carried to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, that not any ladies viſited the theatre from apprehenſion of diſturbances and outrage. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager Dowſon, who paid adoration to his beloved Statira, even equal to the poet's fancy, levelled all his fury on her deſperate foe, Mrs. M'George, by an immediate diſmiſſion, which ſtroke of ſudden impolicy at that juncture only ſerved to enrage the more. Dowſon, ſtill faithful to his faithleſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, rather than Mrs. M'George's party ſhould have reigned triumphant, I verily believe would have taken a torch at noon and ſet our famed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſepolis on fire; but the Fates did what the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager could not, for though the collegians gave
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0593400203:262"/>
ammunition and all manual aſſiſtance in Mrs. M'George's defence, yet they did not (or could not) afford to offer their purſes; therefore, as proviſions grew ſcanty, that tragic queen thought it more prudent and better generalſhip to retreat than be ſtarved by attacking a fortreſs ſhe found determined on obſtinate defence, and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance ſtood very little chance of ſubduing; nor would ſhe truſt to the chance of war, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to threaten inſtant famine; and though ſhe had proved her ability to raiſe diſcord, ſhe plainly found ſhe could not in her diſtreſſed ſtate raiſe the neceſſary ſupplies: for if Dowſon could not pay his regiment with notes from the bank of Air, he could find remaining reſources, and draw from Newcaſtle; but the M'George's forces, tho' few, from deſertions, had, to their ſurpriſe, only the bank of <hi>air</hi> to rely on, ſo off ſhe and her ſpouſe went; and ſoon after her departure, the cauſe of diſpute being removed, Time's lenient hand ſpread over mutual faults, our theatrical wounds were healed, and peace and harmony once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored us to our priſtine health and vigour.—This is no more, in the relation of our ſtage battle at Edinburgh, than a ſtrict matter of fact, and can be atteſted by a gentleman of well-known worth and veracity, Mr. Garenciers, now of York, who was at that time a ſtudent at Edinburgh college.</p>

            <p>I remember in the winter of 1751 that <hi>that</hi> was the ſeaſon Mrs. Cibber was firſt attacked with her ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>omach complaint, and Barry, the divine Barry! either had, or pretended he had, frequent ſore throats and hoarſeneſſes: The comedies in which Mrs. Woffington was principal, were generally brought forward on theſe ſickneſſes of the trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; and at the bottom of the bill, in which ſhe alone ſtood capital, were generally announced the united names of Quin, Barry, and Cibber; of this ſhe conſtantly complained, and at laſt declared that the next time it happened ſhe would not play.—Shortly after Jane Shore was announced, Mrs. Cibber was ill, and the play changed late in the day, but I cannot ſay to what.—The next day the Conſtant Couple was put up: Sir Harry Wildair, Mrs. Woffington; with the great names at the bottom of the bill—Woffington kept her word; ſent a meſſage at five o'clock ſhe was ill, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively refuſed to play—they were obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Miſer; Lovegold, Mr. Macklin. By this time the public began to murmur at their frequent diſappointments, and took it into their heads that Mr. Rich, the manager, was very ill uſed by his company, and determined on the next <hi>indiſpoſition</hi> they would interfere and reſent for

him. Preciſely at this time Woffington made her refuſal, and on her next appearance in Lady Jane Grey the whole weight of their reſentment fell on her—whoever is living and ſaw her that night will own they never beheld any figure half ſo beautiful ſince—her anger gave a glow to her complexion, and even added luſtre to her charming eyes; they treated her very rudely, bade her aſk pardon, and threw orange peels: She behaved with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and treated their rudeneſs with glorious contempt; ſhe left the ſtage, was called for, and with infinite perſuaſion was prevailed on to return. However, ſhe did, walked forward, and told them ſhe was there ready and willing to perform her character if they choſe to permit her; that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was <hi>theirs, on</hi> or <hi>off,</hi> juſt as they pleaſed, a matter of indifference to her.—The <hi>ons</hi> had it, and all went ſmoothly afterwards, though ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways perſiſted in believing that the party was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally formed by Mr. Rich's family and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friends, ſome of whom ſhe did not ſcruple to name, though I believe ſhe always acquitted him of any knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>It is often mentioned in the country that a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager ſhould prevent every riot—that a manager ſhould be ready to anſwer on any frivolous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—were that to be really ſubmitted to, how could Mr. Garrick dared to have had a palace at
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0593400203:265"/>
Hampton Court for his chief reſidence, or Mr. Harris live at Knightſbridge conſtantly, or be part of the ſeaſon at Bath, entruſting the care of the theatre and anſwers to the public in caſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen particular diſturbances to Mr. Kemble, Mr. Lewis, or the principal actor then on the ſpot, if danger or misfortune threatened?—Theſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in the country leads to incendiary epiſtles. But how can ſuch daemons, pretended friends, or ſecret enemies, be anſwered either as to their ill-will or affected good wiſhes, equally immaterial and not availing? as, be the contents right or wrong, true or falſe, good or bad, it would be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and really loſs of time to anſwer what is avowedly fabricated by <hi>nobody.</hi> I had in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof formed a reſolution in future never to read any one of the kind, and had in fact car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the reſolve into practice; but accident only broke the determination, for one morning laſt York races, on opening a letter and not perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any name, I threw it on the table, which Mrs. W. peruſed, and haſtily declared I had an eſtate le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I on inquiry was ſoon informed by a moſt reſpectable family in Eſſex, that the executors had been from ſuch letters greatly plagued and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by different applications, and that one perſon had actually travelled ſome hundred miles, with great fatigue, trouble, perplexity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to attain the Suſſex eſtate, but was ſoon after his arrival convinced it was all a bubble.</p>
