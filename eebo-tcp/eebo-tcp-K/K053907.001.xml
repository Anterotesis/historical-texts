            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

SICILIAN ROMANCE.</head>
            <p>ON the northern ſhore of Sicily are
ſtill to be ſeen the magnificent
remains of a caſtle, which formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the noble houſe of Mazzini.
It ſtands in the centre of a ſmall bay,
and upon a gentle acclivity, which, on
one ſide, ſlopes towards the ſea, and on
the other riſes into an eminence crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by dark woods. The ſituation is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
beautiful and pictureſque, and
the ruins have an air of ancient gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
which, contraſted with the preſent
ſolitude of the ſcene, impreſſes the
traveller with awe and curioſity. During
my travels abroad I viſited this ſpot.
As I walked over the looſe fragments
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0793800201:4"/>
of ſtone, which lay ſcattered through
the immenſe area of the fabrick, and
ſurveyed the ſublimity and grandeur of
the ruins, I recurred, by a natural aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of ideas, to the times when theſe
walls ſtood proudly in their original
ſplendour, when the halls were the
ſcenes of hoſpitality and feſtive magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
and when they reſounded with
the voices of thoſe whom death had long
ſince ſwept from the earth. "Thus,
ſaid I," ſhall the preſent generation—he
who now ſinks in miſery—and he
who now ſwims in pleaſure, alike paſs
away and be forgotten." My heart ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the reflection; and, as I turned
from the ſcene with a ſigh, I fixed
my eyes upon a friar, whoſe venerable
figure, gently bending towards the
earth, formed no unintereſting object in
the picture. He obſerved my emotion;
and, as my eye met his, ſhook his head
and pointed to the ruin. "Theſe walls,"
ſaid he, "were once the ſeat of luxury
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0793800201:5"/>
and vice. They exhibited a ſingular
inſtance of the retribution of Heaven,
and were from that period forſaken,
and abandoned to decay." His words
excited my curioſity, and I enquired
further concerning their meaning.</p>
            <p>"A ſolemn hiſtory belongs to this
caſtle," ſaid he, "which is too long and
intricate for me to relate. It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
contained in a manuſcript in our
library, of which, I could, perhaps, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
you a ſight. A brother of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
a deſcendant of the noble houſe of
Mazzini, collected and recorded the
moſt ſtriking incidents relating to his
family, and the hiſtory thus formed, he
left as a legacy to our convent. If you
pleaſe, we will walk thither."</p>
            <p>I accompanied him to the convent,
and the friar introduced me to his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
a man of an intelligent mind and
benevolent heart, with whom I paſſed
ſome hours in intereſting converſation.
I believe my ſentiments pleaſed him;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0793800201:6"/>
for by his indulgence, I was permitted
to take abſtracts of the hiſtory before
me, which, with ſome further particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
obtained in converſation with the
abate, I have arranged in the following
pages.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>TOWARDS the cloſe of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
century, this caſtle was in
the poſſeſſion of Ferdinand, fifth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of Mazzini, and was for ſome years
the principal reſidence of his family.
He was a man of a voluptuous and
imperious character. To his firſt wife,
he married Louiſa Bernini, ſecond
daughter of the count della Salario,
a lady yet more diſtinguiſhed for the
ſweetneſs of her manners and the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs
of her diſpoſition, than for her
beauty. She brought the marquis
one ſon and two daughters, who loſt
their amiable mother in early child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
The arrogant and impetuous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the marquis, operated power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
upon the mild and ſuſceptible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his lady; and it was by many
perſons believed, that his unkindneſs
and neglect put a period to her life.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0793800201:8"/>
However this might be, he ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
married Maria de Vellorno, a
young lady eminently beautiful, but of
a character very oppoſite to that of her
predeceſſor. She was a woman of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
art, devoted to pleaſure, and of an
unconquerable ſpirit. The marquis,
whoſe heart was dead to paternal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
and whoſe preſent lady was too
volatile to attend to domeſtic concerns,
committed the education of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the care of a lady, completely
qualified for the undertaking, and who
was diſtantly related to the late marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>He quitted Mazzini ſoon after his
ſecond marriage, for the gaieties and
ſplendour of Naples, whither his ſon
accompanied him. Though naturally
of a haughty and overbearing diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he was governed by his wife. His
paſſions were vehement, and ſhe had the
addreſs to bend them to her own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0793800201:9"/>
and ſo well to conceal her influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that he thought himſelf moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
when he was moſt enſlaved.
He paid an annual viſit to the caſtle of
Mazzini; but the marchioneſs ſeldom
attended him, and he ſtaid only to give
ſuch general directions concerning the
education of his daughters, as his pride,
rather than his affection, ſeemed to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
               <p>Emilia, the elder, inherited much of
her mother's diſpoſition. She had a
mild and ſweet temper, united with a
clear and comprehenſive mind. Her
younger ſiſter, Julia, was of a more
lively caſt. An extreme ſenſibility ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
her to frequent uneaſineſs; her
temper was warm, but generous; ſhe
was quickly irritated and quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed;
and to a reproof, however gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
the would often weep, but was never
ſullen. Her imagination was ardent,
and her mind early exhibited ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0793800201:10"/>
of genius. It was the particular
care of madame de Menon to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
thoſe traits in the diſpoſition of her
young pupils, which appeared inimical
to their future happineſs; and for this
taſk ſhe had abilities which entitled her
to hope for ſucceſs. A ſeries of early
misfortunes had entendered her heart,
without weakening the powers of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
In retirement ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
tranquillity, and had almoſt loſt
the conſciouſneſs of thoſe ſorrows which
yet threw a ſoft and not unpleaſing
ſhade over her character. She loved
her young charge with maternal fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and their gradual improvement
and reſpectful tenderneſs repaid all
her anxiety. Madame excelled in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic
and drawing. She had often forgot
her ſorrows in theſe amuſements, when
her mind was too much occupied to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
conſolation from books, and ſhe was
aſſiduous to impart to Emilia and Julia
a power ſo valuable as that of beguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0793800201:11"/>
the ſenſe of affliction. Emilia's
taſte led her to drawing, and ſhe ſoon
made rapid advances in that art. Julia
was uncommonly ſuſceptible of the
charms of harmony. She had feelings
which trembled in uniſon to all its vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and enchanting powers.</p>
               <p>The inſtructions of madame ſhe caught
with aſtoniſhing quickneſs and in a ſhort
time attained to a degree of excellence
in her favourite ſtudy, which few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
have ever exceeded. Her manner
was entirely her own. It was not in
the rapid intricacies of execution, that
ſhe excelled ſo much as in that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of taſte, and in thoſe enchanting
powers of expreſſion, which ſeem to
breathe a ſoul through the ſound, and
which take captive the heart of the
hearer. The lute was her favourite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
and its tender notes accorded
well with the ſweet and melting tones
of her voice.</p>
               <p>The caſtle of Mazzini was a large ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0793800201:12"/>
regular fabrick, and ſeemed ſuited to
receive a numerous train of followers,
ſuch as, in thoſe days, ſerved the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
either in the ſplendour of peace, or
the turbulence of war. Its preſent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
inhabited only a ſmall part of it;
and even this part appeared forlorn and
almoſt deſolate from the ſpaciouſneſs of
the apartments, and the length of the
galleries which led to them. A melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
ſtillneſs reigned through the halls,
and the ſilence of the courts, which
were ſhaded by high turrets, was for
many hours together undiſturbed by
the ſound of any foot-ſtep. Julia, who
diſcovered an early taſte for books,
loved to retire in an evening to a ſmall
cloſet in which ſhe had collected her
favourite authors. This room formed
the weſtern angle of the caſtle: one of
its windows looked upon the ſea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which was faintly ſeen, ſkirting
the horizon, the dark rocky coaſt of
Calabria; the other opened towards a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0793800201:13"/>
part of the caſtle, and afforded a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the neighbouring woods. Her
muſical inſtruments were here depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with whatever aſſiſted her favourite
amuſements. This ſpot, which was at
once elegant, pleaſant, and retired, was
embelliſhed with many little ornaments
of her own invention, and with ſome
drawings executed by her ſiſter. The
cloſet was adjoining her chamber, and
was ſeparated from the apartments of
madame, only by a ſhort gallery. This
gallery opened into another, long and
winding, which led to the grand ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
terminating in the north hall, with
which the chief apartments of the north
ſide of the edifice communicated.</p>
               <p>Madame de Menon's apartment open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into both galleries. It was in one of
theſe rooms that ſhe uſually ſpent the
mornings, occupied in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her young charge. The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
looked towards the ſea, and the
room was light and pleaſant. It was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0793800201:14"/>
their cuſtom to dine in one of the lower
apartments, and at table they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
joined by a dependant of the
marquis's, who had reſided many years
in the caſtle, and who inſtructed the
young ladies in the latin tongue, and
in geography. During the fine even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of ſummer, this little party fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſupped in a pavillion, which
was built on an eminence in the woods
belonging to the caſtle. From this ſpot
the eye had an almoſt boundleſs range
of ſea and land. It commanded the
ſtraits of Meſſina, with the oppoſite
ſhores of Calabria, and a great extent
of the wild and pictureſque ſcenery of
Sicily. Mount AEtna, crowned with
eternal ſnows, and ſhooting from among
the clouds, formed a grand and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
picture in the back ground of the
ſcene. The city of Palermo was alſo
diſtinguiſhable; and Julia, as ſhe gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on its glittering ſpires, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
in imagination to depicture its
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0793800201:15"/>
beauties, while ſhe ſecretly ſighed for
a view of that world, from which ſhe
had hitherto been ſecluded by the mean
jealouſy of the marchioneſs, upon whoſe
mind the dread of rival beauty operated
ſtrongly to the prejudice of Emilia and
Julia. She employed all her influence
over the marquis to detain them in
retirement; and, though Emilia was
now twenty, and her ſiſter eighteen,
they had never paſſed the boundaries
of their father's domains.</p>
               <p>Vanity often produces unreaſonable
alarm; but the marchioneſs had in this
inſtance juſt grounds for apprehenſion;
the beauty of her lord's daughters has
ſeldom been exceeded. The perſon of
Emilia was finely proportioned. Her
complexion was fair, her hair flaxen,
and her dark blue eyes were full of
ſweet expreſſion. Her manners were
dignified and elegant, and in her air was
a feminine ſoftneſs, a tender timidity,
which irreſiſtibly attracted the heart of
the beholder. The figure of Julia was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0793800201:16"/>
light and graceful—her ſtep was airy—her
mien animated, and her ſmile en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting.
Her eyes were dark, and
full of fire, but tempered with modeſt
ſweetneſs. Her features were finely
turned—every laughing grace played
round her mouth, and her countenance
quickly diſcovered all the various emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of her ſoul. The dark auburn
hair which curled in beautiful profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in her neck, gave a finiſhing charm
to her appearance.</p>
               <p>Thus lovely, and thus veiled in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,
were the daughters of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mazzini. But they were happy, for
they knew not enough of the world ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
to regret the want of its enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
though Julia would ſometimes
ſigh for the airy image which her fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
painted, and a painful curioſity
would ariſe concerning the buſy ſcenes
from which ſhe was excluded. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to her cuſtomary amuſements,
however, would chaſe the ideal image
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0793800201:17"/>
from her mind, and reſtore her uſual
happy complacency. Books, muſic,
and painting, divided the hours of her
leiſure, and many beautiful ſummer
evenings were ſpent in the pavillion,
where the refined converſation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
the poetry of Taſſo, the lute
of Julia, and the friendſhip of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
combined to form a ſpecies of
happineſs, ſuch as elevated and highly
ſuſceptible minds are alone capable of
receiving or communicating. Madame
underſtood and practiſed all the graces
of converſation, and her young pupils
perceived its value, and caught the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of its character.</p>
               <p>Converſation may be divided into
two claſſes—the familiar and the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.
It is the province of the familiar,
to diffuſe chearfulneſs and eaſe—to open
the heart of man to man, and to beam a
temperate ſunſhine upon the mind.—Nature
and art muſt conſpire to render
us ſuſceptible of the charms, and to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0793800201:18"/>
qualify us for the practice of the ſecond
claſs of converſation, here termed ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
and in which madame de Menon
particularly excelled. To good ſenſe,
lively feeling, and natural delicacy of
taſte, muſt be united an expanſion of
mind, and a refinement of thought,
which is the reſult of high cultivation.
To render this ſort of converſation irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly
attractive, a knowledge of the
world is requiſite, and that enchanting
eaſe, that elegance of manner, which is
to be acquired only by frequenting the
higher circles of poliſhed life. In ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental
converſation, ſubjects intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the heart, and to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are brought forward; they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed
in a kind of ſportive way, with
animation and refinement, and are never
continued longer than politeneſs allows.
Here fancy flouriſhes,—the ſenſibilities
expand—and wit, guided by delicacy
and embelliſhed by taſte—points to the
heart.</p>

Such was the converſation of madame
de Menon; and the pleaſant gaiety of
the pavillion ſeemed peculiarly to adapt
it for the ſcene of ſocial delights. On
the evening of a very ſultry day, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſupped in their favourite ſpot, the
coolneſs of the hour, and the beauty of
the night, tempted this happy party to
remain there later than uſual. Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home, they were ſurpriſed by the
appearance of a light through the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
window-ſhutters of an apartment,
belonging to a diviſion of the caſtle
which had for many years been ſhut up.
They ſtopped to obſerve it, when it
ſuddenly diſappeared and was ſeen no
more. Madame de Menon, diſturbed
at this phaenomenon, haſtened into the
caſtle, with a view of enquiring into the
cauſe of it, when ſhe was met in the
north hall by Vincent. She related to
him what ſhe had ſeen, and ordered an
immediate ſearch to be made for the
keys of thoſe apartments. She appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0793800201:20"/>
that ſome perſon had penetrated
that part of the edifice with an intention
of plunder; and, diſdaining a paltry
fear where her duty was concerned, ſhe
ſummoned the ſervants of the caſtle,
with an intention of accompanying them
thither. Vincent ſmiled at her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
and imputed what ſhe had ſeen
to an illuſion, which the ſolemnity of
the hour had impreſſed upon her fancy.
Madame, however, perſevered in her
purpoſe; and, after a long and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſearch, a maſſey key covered with
ruſt was produced. She then proceeded
to the ſouthern ſide of the edifice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by Vincent, and followed
by the ſervants, who were agitated with
impatient wonder. The key was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to an iron gate, which opened
into a court that ſeparated this diviſion
from the other parts of the caſtle. They
entered this court, which was overgrown
with graſs and weeds, and aſcended
ſome ſteps that led to a large door,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0793800201:21"/>
which they vainly endeavoured to open.
All the different keys of the caſtle were
applied to the lock, without effect, and
they were at length compelled to quit
the place, without having either ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
their curioſity, or quieted their
fears. Every thing, however, was ſtill,
and the light did not re-appear. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
concealed her apprehenſions, and
the family retired to reſt.</p>
               <p>This circumſtance dwelt on the mind
of madame de Menon, and it was ſome
time before ſhe venturned again to,
ſpend an evening in the pavillion. After
ſeveral months paſſed, without further
diſturbance or diſcovery, another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
renewed the alarm. Julia had
one night remained in her cloſet later
than uſual. A favourite book had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
her attention beyond the hour of
cuſtomary repoſe, and every inhabitant
of the caſtle, except herſelf, had long
been loſt in ſleep. She was rouſed from
her forgetfulneſs, by the found of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0793800201:22"/>
caſtle clock, which ſtruck one. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
at the lateneſs of the hour, ſhe
roſe in haſte, and was moving to her
chamber, when the beauty of the night
attracted her to the window. She open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; and obſerving a fine effect of
moon-light upon the dark woods, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forwards. In that ſituation ſhe had
not long remained, when ſhe perceived
a light faintly flaſh though a caſement
in the uninhabited part of the caſtle.
A ſudden tremor ſeized her, and ſhe
with difficulty ſupported herſelf. In a
few moments it diſappeared, and ſoon
after a figure, bearing a lamp, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from an obſcure door belonging to
the ſouth tower; and ſtealing along the
outſide of the caſtle walls, turned round
the ſouthern angle, by which it was
afterwards hid from the view. Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
and terrified at what ſhe had
ſeen, ſhe hurried to the apartment of
madame de Menon, and related the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.
The ſervants were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0793800201:23"/>
rouſed, and the alarm became
general. Madame aroſe and deſcended
into the north hall, where the domeſtics
were already aſſembled. No one could
be found of courage ſufficient to enter
into the courts; and the orders of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
were diſregarded, when oppoſed
to the effects of ſuperſtitious terror.
She perceived that Vincent was abſent,
but as ſhe was ordering him to be called,
he entered the hall. Surpriſed to find
the family thus aſſembled, he was told
the occaſion. He immediately ordered
a party of the ſervants to attend him
round the caſtle walls; and with ſome
reluctance, and more fear, they obeyed
him. They all returned to the hall,
without having witneſſed any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
appearance; but though their
fears were not confirmed, they were by
no means diſſipated. The appearance
of a light in a part of the caſtle which
had for ſeveral years been ſhut up, and
to which time and circumſtance had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0793800201:24"/>
given an air of ſingular deſolation,
might reaſonably be ſuppoſed to excite
a ſtrong degree of ſurpriſe and terror.
In the minds of the vulgar, any ſpecies
of the wonderful is received with avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;
and the ſervants did not heſitate
in believing the ſouthern diviſion of
the caſtle to be inhabited by a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
power. Too much agitated
to ſleep, they agreed to watch for
the remainder of the night. For this
purpoſe they arranged themſelves in
the eaſt gallery, where they had a
view of the ſouth tower from which
the light had iſſued. The night, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
paſſed without any further diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and the morning dawn, which
they beheld with inexpreſſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
diſſipated for a while the glooms of
apprehenſion. But the return of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
renewed the general fear, and for
ſeveral ſucceſſive nights the domeſtics
watched the ſouthern tower. Although
nothing remarkable was ſeen, a report
was ſoon raiſed, and believed, that the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0793800201:25"/>
ſouthern ſide of the caſtle was haunted.
Madame de Menon, whoſe mind was
ſuperior to the effects of ſuperſtition,
was yet diſturbed and perplexed, and
ſhe determined, if the light re-appeared,
to inform the marquis of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and requeſt the keys of thoſe
apartments.</p>
               <p>The marquis, immerſed in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipations
of Naples, ſeldom remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the caſtle, or its inhabitants. His
ſon, who had been educated under his
immediate care, was the ſole object of
his pride, as the marchioneſs was that of
his affection. He loved her with ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic
fondneſs, which ſhe repaid with
ſeeming tenderneſs, and ſecret perfidy.
She allowed herſelf a free indulgence
in the moſt licentious pleaſures, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
herſelf with an art ſo exquiſite
as to elude diſcovery, and even ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In her amours ſhe was equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
as ardent, till the young count
Hippozitus de Vereza attracted, her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
The natural fickleneſs of her
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0793800201:26"/>
diſpoſition ſeemed then to ceaſe, and
upon him ſhe centered all her deſires.</p>
               <p>The count Vereza loſt his father in
early childhood. He was now of age,
and had juſt entered upon the poſſeſſion
of his eſtates. His perſon was grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
yet manly; his mind accompliſhed,
and his manners elegant; his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
expreſſed a happy union of ſpirit,
dignity, and benevolence, which form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the principal traits of his character.
He had a ſublimity of thought, which
taught him to deſpiſe the voluptuous
vices of the Neapolitans, and led him
to higher purſuits. He was the choſen
and early friend of young Ferdinand,
the ſon of the marquis, and was a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
viſitor in the family. When the
marchioneſs firſt ſaw him, ſhe treated
him with great diſtinction, and at length
made ſuch advances, as neither the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
nor the inclinations of the count
permitted him to notice. He conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf towards her with frigid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
which ſerved only to inflame
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0793800201:27"/>
the paſſion it was meant to chill. The
favours of the marchioneſs had hitherto
been ſought with avidity, and accepted
with rapture; and the repulſive inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
which ſhe now experienced, rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all her pride, and called into action
every refinement of coquetry.</p>
               <p>It was about this period that Vincent
was ſeized with a diſorder which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
ſo rapidly, as in a ſhort time to
aſſume the moſt alarming appearance.
Deſpairing of life, he deſired that a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
might be diſpatched to inform
the marquis of his ſituation, and to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
his earneſt wiſh to ſee him before
he died. The progreſs of his diſorder
defied every art of medicine, and his
viſible diſtreſs of mind ſeemed to acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate
his fate. Perceiving his laſt hour
approaching, he requeſted to have a
confeſſor. The confeſſor was ſhut up
with him a conſiderable time, and he
had already received extreme unction,
when Madame de Menon was ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his bed ſide. The hand of death
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0793800201:28"/>
was now upon him, cold damps hung
upon his brows, and he, with difficulty,
raiſed his heavy eyes to Madame as ſhe
entered the apartment. He beckoned
her towards him, and deſiring that no
perſon might be permitted to enter the
room, was for a few moments ſilent.
His mind appeared to labour under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
remembrances; he made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
attempts to ſpeak, but either reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or ſtrength failed him. At length,
giving Madame a look of unutterable
anguiſh, "Alas, madam," ſaid he,
"Heaven grants not the prayer of ſuch a
wretch as I am. I muſt expire long before
the marquis can arrive. Since I ſhall
ſee him no more, I would impart to you
a ſecret which lies heavy at my heart,
and which makes my laſt moments
dreadful, as they are without hope." Be
comforted" ſaid Madame, who was affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the energy of his manner, "we are
taught to believe that forgiveneſs is
never denied to ſincere repentance."</p>
               <p>"You, madam, are ignorant of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0793800201:29"/>
enormity of my crime, and of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret—the
horrid ſecret which labours
at my breaſt. My guilt is beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
in this world, and I fear will be
without pardon in the next; I therefore
hope little from confeſſion even to a
prieſt. Yet ſome good it is ſtill in my
power to do; let me diſcloſe to you that
ſecret which is ſo myſteriouſly connected
with the ſouthern apartments of this
caſtle." "What of them!" exclaimed
Madame, with impatience. Vincent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
no anſwer; exhauſted by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of ſpeaking, he had fainted. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
rung for aſſiſtance, and by proper
applications, his ſenſes were recalled.
He was, however, entirely ſpeechleſs,
and in this ſtate he remained till he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
which was about an hour after
he had converſed with Madame.</p>
               <p>The perplexity and aſtoniſhment of
Madame, were by the late ſcene height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
to a very painful degree. She
recollected the various particulars rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the ſouthern diviſion of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0793800201:30"/>
caſtle, the many years it had ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited—the
ſilence which had been
obſerved concerning it—the appearance
of the light and the figure—the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſearch for the keys, and the reports
ſo generally believed; and thus remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
preſented her with a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of circumſtances, which ſerved only
to increaſe her wonder, and heighten her
curioſity. A veil of myſtery enveloped
that part of the caſtle, which it now
ſeemed impoſſible ſhould ever be pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated,
ſince the only perſon who could
have removed it, was no more.</p>
               <p>The marquis arrived on the day
after that on which Vincent had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.
He came attended by ſervants
only, and alighted at the gates of the
caſtle with an air of impatience, and a
countenance expreſſive of ſtrong emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Madame, with the young ladies,
received him in the hall. He haſtily
ſaluted his daughters, and paſſed on to
the oak parlour, deſiring Madame to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0793800201:31"/>
follow him. She obeyed, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
enquired with great agitation after
Vincent. When told of his death, he
paced the room with hurried ſteps, and
was for ſome time ſilent, at length
ſeating himſelf, and ſurveying Madame
with a ſcrutinizing eye, he aſked ſome
queſtions concerning the particulars
of Vincent's death. She mentioned
his earneſt deſire to ſee the marquis,
and repeated his laſt words. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
remained ſilent, and Madame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to mention thoſe circumſtances
relative to the ſouthern divion of the
caſtle, which ſhe thought it of ſo
much importance to diſcover. He
treated the affair very lightly, laughed
at her conjectures, repreſented the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
ſhe deſcribed as the illuſions
of a weak and timid mind, and broke up
the converſation, by going to viſit the
chamber of Vincent, in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a conſiderable time.</p>
               <p>On the following day Emilia and
Julia dined with the marquis. He was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0793800201:32"/>
gloomy and ſilent; their efforts to amuſe
him ſeemed to excite diſpleaſure rather
than kindneſs; and when the repaſt was
concluded, he withdrew to his own
apartment, leaving his daughters in a
ſtate of ſorrow and ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>Vincent was to be interred, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own deſire, in the church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the convent of St. Nicholas.
One of the ſervants, after receiving
ſome neceſſary orders concerning the
funeral, ventured to inform the marquis
of the appearance of the lights in the
ſouth tower. He mentioned the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
reports that prevailed amongſt
the houſhold, and complained that the
ſervants would not croſs the courts after
it was dark. "And who is he that has
commiſſioned you with this ſtory?" ſaid
the marquis, in a tone of diſpleaſure;
are the weak and ridiculous fancies of
women and ſervants to be obtruded
upon my notice? Away—appear no
more before me, till you have learned
to ſpeak what it is proper for me to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0793800201:33"/>
hear." Robert withdrew abaſhed, and
it was ſome time before any perſon ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to renew the ſubject with the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis.</p>
               <p>The majority of young Ferdinand
now drew near, and the marquis deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to celebrate the occaſion with
feſtive magnificence at the caſtle of
Mazzini. He therefore ſummoned
the marchioneſs, and his ſon, from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and very ſplendid preparations
were ordered to be made. Emilia and,
Julia dreaded the arrival of the marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
whoſe influence they had long
been ſenſible of, and from whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
they anticipated a painful reſtraint.
Beneath the gentle guidance of Madame
de Menon, their hours had paſſed in
happy tranquillity, for they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
alike of the ſorrows and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the world. Thoſe did not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
and theſe did not inflame them.
Engaged in the purſuits of knowledge,
and in the attainment of elegant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0793800201:34"/>
their moments flew lightly
away, and the flight of time was mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only by improvement. In Madame
was united the tenderneſs of the mother,
with the ſympathy of a friend; and they
loved her with a warm and inviolable
affection.</p>
               <p>The purpoſed viſit of their brother,
whom they had not ſeen for ſeveral
years, gave them great pleaſure. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their minds retained no very
diſtinct remembrance of him, they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forward with eager and delightful
expectation to his virtues and his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents;
and hoped to find in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
a conſolation for the uneaſineſs
which the preſence of the marchioneſs
would excite. Neither did Julia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
with indifference the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
feſtival. A new ſcene was now
opening to her, which her young ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
painted in the warm and glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
colours of delight. The near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
of pleaſure frequently awakens
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0793800201:35"/>
the heart to emotions, which would fail
to be excited by a more remote and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
obſervance, Julia, who in the
diſtance, had conſidered the ſplendid
gaieties of life with tranquillity, now
lingered with impatient hope through
the moments which withheld her from
their enjoyments. Emilia, whoſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were leſs lively, and whoſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was leſs powerful, beheld the
approaching feſtival with calm conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and almoſt regretted the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe tranquil pleaſures, which
ſhe knew to be more congenial with
her powers and diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>In a few days the marchioneſs arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the caſtle. She was followed by a
numerous retinue, and accompanied by
Ferdinand, and ſeveral of the Italian
nobleſſe, whom pleaſure attracted to her
train. Her entrance was proclaimed
by the found of muſic, and thoſe gates
which had long ruſted on their hinges,
were thrown open to receive her. The
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0793800201:36"/>
courts and halls, whoſe aſpect ſo lately
expreſſed only gloom and deſolation,
now ſhone with ſudden ſplendor, and
echoed the ſounds of gaiety and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Julia ſurveyed the ſcene from an
obſcure window; and as the triumphal
ſtrains filled the air, her breaſt throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
her heart beat quick with joy, and
ſhe loſt her apprehenſions from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
in a ſort of wild delight hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
unknown to her. The arrival of the
marchioneſs ſeemed indeed the ſignal
of univerſal and unlimited pleaſure.
When the marquis came out to receive
her, the gloom that lately clouded his
countenance, broke away in ſmiles of
welcome, which the whole company
appeared to conſider as invitations to
joy.</p>
               <p>The tranquil heart of Emilia was not
proof againſt a ſcene ſo alluring, and
ſhe ſighed at the proſpect, yet ſcarcely
knew why. Julia pointed out to her
ſiſter, the graceful figure of a young
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0793800201:37"/>
man who followed the marchioneſs,
and ſhe expreſſed her wiſhes that he
might be her brother. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the ſcene before them,
they were ſummoned to meet the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs.
Julia trembled with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
and for a few moments wiſhed
the caſtle was in its former ſtate. As
they advanced through the ſaloon, in
which they were preſented, Julia was
covered with bluſhes, but Emilia, tho'
equally timid, preſerved her graceful
dignity. The marchioneſs received
them with a mingled ſmile of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion
and politeneſs, and immediately
the whole attention of the company
was attracted by their elegance and
beauty. The eager eyes of Julia ſought
in vain to diſcover her brother, of whoſe
features ſhe had no recollection in thoſe
of any of the perſons then preſent. At
length her father preſented him, and
ſhe perceived with a ſigh of regret, that
he was not the youth ſhe had obſerved
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0793800201:38"/>
from the window. He advanced with
a very engaging air, and ſhe met him
with an unfeigned welcome. His figure
was tall and majeſtic; he had a very
noble and ſpirited carriage; and his
countenance expreſſed at once ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and dignity. Supper was ſerved
in the eaſt hall, and the tables were
ſpread with a profuſion of delicacies.
A band of muſic played during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt,
and the evening concluded with a
concert in the ſaloon.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>THE day of the feſtival, ſo long and
ſo impatiently looked for by Julia,
was now arrived. All the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nobility were invited, and the gates
of the caſtle were thrown open for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
rejoicing. A magnificent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
conſiſting of the moſt luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and expenſive diſhes, was ſerved
in the halls. Soft muſic floated along
the vaulted roofs, the walls were hung
with decorations, and it ſeemed as if the
hand of a magician had ſuddenly meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed
this once gloomy fabric into
the palace of a fairy. The marquis,
notwithſtanding the gaiety of the ſcene,
frequently appeared abſtracted from its
enjoyments, and in ſpite of all his efforts
at cheerfulneſs, the melancholy of his
heart was viſible in his countenance.</p>
               <p>In the evening there was a grand
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0793800201:40"/>
ball: the marchioneſs, who was ſtill
diſtinguiſhed for her beauty, and for
the winning elegance of her manners,
appeared in the moſt ſplendid attire.
Her hair was ornamented with a profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of jewels, but was ſo diſpoſed as to
give an air rather of voluptuouſneſs,
than of grace, to her figure. Although
conſcious of her charms, ſhe beheld the
beauty of Emilia and Julia with a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
eye, and was compelled ſecretly to
acknowledge, that the ſimple elegance
with which they were adorned, was
more enchanting than all the ſtudied
artifice of ſplendid decoration. They
were dreſſed alike in light Sicilian
habits, and the beautiful luxuriance of
their flowing hair, was reſtrained only
by bandellets of pearl. The ball was
opened by Ferdinand, and the lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda
Conſtanza. Emilia danced with
the young marquis della Fazelli, and
acquitted herſelf with the eaſe and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
ſo natural to her. Julia experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0793800201:41"/>
a various emotion of pleaſure and
fear when the count de Vereza, in whom
ſhe recollected the cavalier ſhe had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from the window, led her forth.
The grace of her ſtep, and the elegant
ſymmetry of her figure, raiſed in the
aſſembly a gentle murmur of applauſe,
and the ſoft bluſh which now ſtole over
her cheek, gave an additional charm to
her appearance. But when the muſic
changed, and ſhe danced to the ſoft Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian
meaſure, the airy grace of her
movement, and the unaffected tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her air, ſunk attention into ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which continued for ſome time
after the dance had ceaſed. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
obſerved the general admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with ſeeming pleaſure, and ſecret
uneaſineſs. She had ſuffered a very
painful ſolicitude, when the count de
Vereza ſelected her for his partner in
the dance, and ſhe purſued him through
the evening, with an eye of jealous ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny.
Her boſom, which before glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0793800201:42"/>
only with love, was now torn by the
agitation of other paſſions more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and deſtructive. Her thoughts
were reſtleſs, her mind wandered from
the ſcene before her, and it required all
her addreſs to preſerve an apparent eaſe.
She ſaw, or fancied ſhe ſaw, an impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
air in the count, when he addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf to Julia, that corroded her
heart with jealous fury.</p>
               <p>At twelve the gates of the caſtle were
thrown open, and the company quitted
it for the woods, which were ſplendidly
illuminated. Arcades of light lined the
long viſtas, which were terminated by
pyramids of lamps that preſented to
the eye one bright column of flame.
At irregular diſtances buildings were
erected, hung with variegated lamps
diſpoſed in the gayeſt and moſt fantaſtic
forms. Collations were ſpread under
the trees; and muſic, touched by unſeen
hands, breathed around. The muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were placed in the moſt obſcure
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0793800201:43"/>
and embowered ſpots, ſo as to elude the
eye and ſtrike the imagination. The
ſcene appeared enchanted. Nothing
met the eye but beauty, and romantic
ſplendor; the ear received no ſounds
but thoſe of mirth and melody. The
younger part of the company formed
themſelves into groups, which at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
glanced through the woods, and
were again unſeen. Julia ſeemed the
magic queen of the place. Her heart
dilated with pleaſure, and diffuſed over
her features an expreſſion of pure and
complacent delight. A generous, frank,
and exalted ſentiment ſparkled in her
eyes, and animated her manner. Her
boſom glowed with benevolent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and ſhe ſeemed anxious to impart
to all around her, a happineſs as unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as that ſhe experienced. Wherever
ſhe moved, admiration followed her
ſteps. Ferdinand was as gay as the
ſcene around him. Emilia was pleaſed;
and the marquis ſeemed to have left his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0793800201:44"/>
melancholy in the caſtle. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
alone was wretched. She ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with a ſelect party, in a pavillion on
the ſea ſhore, which was fitted up with
peculiar elegance. It was hung with
white ſilk, drawn up in feſtoons, and
richly fringed with gold. The ſofas
were of the ſame materials, and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
wreaths of lamps and of roſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twined
the columns. A row of ſmall
lamps placed about the cornice, formed
an edge of light round the roof which,
with the other numerous lights, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
in a blaze of ſplendor from the
large mirrors that adorned the room.
The count Muriani was of the party;—he
complimented the marchioneſs on
the beauty of her daughters; and after
lamenting with gaiety the captives
which their charms would enthral, he
mentioned the count de Vereza. "He
is certainly of all others the man moſt
deſerving the lady Julia. As they
danced, I thought they exhibited a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0793800201:45"/>
model of the beauty of either ſex;
and if I miſtake not, they are inſpired
with a mutual admiration." The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs,
endeavouring to conceal her
uneaſineſs, ſaid, "Yes, my lord, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the count all the merit you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
him, but from the little I have
ſeen of his diſpoſition, he is too volatile
for a ſerious attachment."—At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
the count entered the pavillion:
"Ah, ſaid Muriani, laughingly, you
was the ſubject of our converſation, and
ſeem to be come in good time to
receive the honours alloted you. I
was interceding with the marchioneſs
for her intereſt in your favour, with the
lady Julia; but ſhe abſolutely refuſes
it; and though ſhe allows you merit,
alledges, that you are by nature fickle
and inconſtant. What ſay you—would
not the beauty of lady Julia bind your
unſteady heart?"</p>
               <p>"I know not how I have deſerved
that character of the marchioneſs," ſaid
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0793800201:46"/>
the count, with a ſmile, "but that
heart muſt be either fickle or insenſible
in an uncommon degree, which can
boaſt of freedom in the preſence of lady
Julia." The marchioneſs, mortiſied by
the whole converſation, now felt the
full force of Vereza's reply, which ſhe
imagined he pointed with particular
emphaſis.</p>
               <p>The entertainment concluded with a
grand firework, which was exhibited on
the margin of the ſea, and the company
did not part till the dawn of morning.
Julia retired from the ſcene with regret.
She was enchanted with the new world
that was now exhibited to her, and ſhe
was not cool enough to diſtinguiſh the
vivid glow of imagination from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of real bliſs. The pleaſure ſhe
now felt, ſhe believed would always be
renewed, and in an equal degree, by the
objects which firſt excited it. The
weakneſs of humanity is never willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceived by young minds. It is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0793800201:47"/>
painful to know, thatwe are operated
upon by objects whoſe impreſſions are
variable as they are indefinable—and that
what yeſterday affected us ſtrongly, is
to-day but imperfectly felt, and to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
perhaps ſhall be diſregarded. When
at length this unwelcome truth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the mind, we at firſt reject,
with diſguſt, every appearance of good,
we diſdain to partake of a happineſs
which we cannot always command, and
we not unfrequently ſink into a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
deſpair. Wiſdom or accident,
at length, recall us from our error, and
offers to us ſome object capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
a pleaſing, yet laſting effect,
which effect, therefore, we call happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Happineſs has this eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from what is commonly called
pleaſure; that virtue forms its baſis,
and virtue being the offspring of reaſon,
may be expected to produce uniformity
of effect.</p>
               <p>The paſſions which had hitherto lain
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0793800201:48"/>
concealed in Julia's heart, touched by
circumſtance, dilated to its power, and
afforded her a ſlight experience of the
pain and delight which flow from their
influence. The beauty and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments
of Vereza, raiſed in her a
new and various emotion, which reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made her fear to encourage, but
which was too pleaſing to be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.
Tremblingly alive to a ſenſe of
delight, and unchilled by diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the young heart welcomes every
feeling, not ſimply painful, with a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic
expectation, that it will expand
into bliſs.</p>
               <p>Julia ſought with eager anxiety to
diſcover the ſentiments of Vereza to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her; ſhe revolved each circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the day, but they afforded her
little ſatisfaction; they reflected only a
glimmering and uncertain light, which
inſtead of guiding, ſerved only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
her. Now ſhe remembered ſome
inſtance of particular attention, and then
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0793800201:49"/>
ſome mark of apparent indifference
She compared his conduct with that of
the other young nobleſſe; and thought
each appeared equally deſirous of the
favour of every lady preſent. All the
ladies, however, appeared to her to
court the admiration of Vereza, and ſhe
trembled leſt he ſhould be too ſenſible
of the diſtinction. She drew from theſe
reflections no poſitive inference; and
though diſtruſt rendered pain the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate
ſenſation, it was ſo exquiſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interwoven with delight, that ſhe
could not wiſh it exchanged for her
former eaſe. Thoughtful and reſtleſs,
ſleep ſled from her eyes, and ſhe long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with impatience for the morning,
which ſhould again preſent Vereza,
and enable her to purſue the enquiry.
She aroſe early, and adorned herſelf
with unuſual care. In her favourite
cloſet ſhe awaited the hour of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
and endeavoured to read, but her
thoughts wandered from the ſubject.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0793800201:50"/>
Her lute and favourite airs loſt half
their power to pleaſe; the day ſeemed
to ſtand ſtill—ſhe became melancholy,
and thought the breakfaſt hour would
never arrive. At length the clock
ſtruck the ſignal, the ſound vibrated on
every nerve, and trembling ſhe quitted
the cloſet for her ſiſter's apartment.
Love taught her diſguiſe. Till then
Emilia had ſhared all her thoughts;
they now deſcended to the breakfaſt
room in ſilence, and Julia almoſt feared
to meet her eye. In the breakfaſt room
they were alone. Julia found it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to ſupport a converſation with
Emilia, whoſe obſervations interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the courſe of her thoughts, became
unintereſting and tireſome. She was
therefore about to retire to her cloſet,
when the marquis entered. His air was
haughty, and his look ſevere. He cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaluted his daughters, and they had
ſcarcely time to reply to his general
enquiries, when the marchioneſs enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0793800201:51"/>
and the company ſoon after aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
Julia, who had awaited with ſo
painful an impatience for the moment
which ſhould preſent Vereza to her
ſight, now ſighed that it was arrived.
She ſcarcely dared to lift her timid
eyes from the ground, and when by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
they met his, a ſoft tremour
ſeized her; and apprehenſion leſt he
ſhould diſcover her ſentiments, ſerved
only to render her confuſion conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
At length a glance from the
marchioneſs recalled her bewildered
thoughts; and other fears ſuperceding
thoſe of love, her mind, by degrees, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
its dignity. She could diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
in the behaviour of Vereza no
ſymptoms of particular admiration, and
ſhe reſolved to conduct herſelf towards
him with the moſt ſcrupulous care.</p>
               <p>This day, like the preceding one, was
devoted to joy. In the evening there
was a concert, which was chiefly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the nobility. Ferdinand play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0793800201:52"/>
the violincello, Vereza the german
ſlute, and Julia the piano forte, which
ſhe touched with a delicacy and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that engaged every auditor. The
confuſion of Julia may be eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
when Ferdinand, ſelecting a
beautiful duet, deſired Vereza would
accompany his ſiſter. The pride of
conſcious excellence, however, quickly
overcame her timidity, and enabled her
to exert all her powers. The air was
ſimple and pathetic, and ſhe gave it
thoſe charms of expreſſion ſo peculiarly
her own. She ſtruck the chords of her
piano forte in beautiful accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and towards the cloſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſtanza, her voice reſting on one
note, ſwelled into a tone ſo exquiſite,
and from thence deſcended to a few
ſimple notes, which ſhe touched with
ſuch impaſſioned tenderneſs that every
eye wept to the ſounds. The breath of
the ſlute trembled, and Hippolitus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranced,
forgot to play. A pauſe of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0793800201:53"/>
ſilence enſued at the concluſion of the
piece, and continued till a general ſigh
ſeemed to awaken the audience from
their enchantment. Amid the general
applauſe, Hippolitus was ſilent. Julia
obſerved his behaviour, and gently raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her eyes to his, there read the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
which ſhe had inſpired. An
exquiſite emotion thrilled her heart, and
ſhe experienced one of thoſe rare mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which illumine life with a ray of
bliſs, by which the darkneſs of its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ſhade is contraſted. Care, doubt,
every diſagreeable ſenſation vaniſhed,
and for the remainder of the evening
ſhe was conſcious only of delight. A
timid reſpect marked the manner of
Hippolitus, more flattering to Julia
than the moſt ardent profeſſions. The
evening concluded with a ball, and Julia
was again the partner of the count.</p>
               <p>When the ball broke up, ſhe retired
to her apartment, but not to ſleep. Joy
is as reſtleſs as anxiety or ſorrow. She
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0793800201:54"/>
ſeemed to have entered upon a new
ſtate of exiſtence;—thoſe fine ſprings of
affection which had hitherto lain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
were now touched, and yielded
to her a happineſs more exalted than
any her imagination had ever painted.
She reflected on the tranquillity of her
paſt life, and comparing it with the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the preſent hour, exulted in the
difference. All her former pleaſures
now appeared inſipid; ſhe wondered
that they ever had power to affect her,
and that ſhe had endured with content
the dull uniformity to which ſhe had
been condemned. It was now only that
ſhe appeared to live. Abſorbed in the
ſingle idea of being beloved, her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
ſoared into the regions of roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
bliſs, and bore her high above the
poſſibility of evil. Since ſhe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by Hippolitus, ſhe could only be
happy.</p>
               <p>From this ſtate of entranced delight,
ſhe was awakened by the ſound of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0793800201:55"/>
immediately under her window. It
was a lute touched by a maſterly hand.
After a wild and melancholy ſymphony,
a voice of more than magic expreſſion
ſwelled into an air ſo pathetic and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that it ſeemed to breathe the very
ſoul of love. The chords of the lute
were ſtruck in low and ſweet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniment.
Julia liſtened, and diſtinguiſhed
the following words:</p>
               <lg>
                  <head>SONNET.</head>
                  <lg>
                     <l>STILL is the night-breeze!—not a lonely ſound</l>
                     <l>Steals through the ſilence of this dreary hour;</l>
                     <l>O'er theſe high battlements Sleep reigns profound,</l>
                     <l>And ſheds on all, his ſweet oblivious power.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>On all but me—I vainly aſk his dews</l>
                     <l>To ſteep in ſhort forgetfulneſs my cares.</l>
                     <l>Th' affrighted god ſtill flies when Love purſues,</l>
                     <l>Still—ſtill denies the wretched lover's prayers.</l>
                  </lg>
               </lg>
               <p>An interval of ſilence followed, and
the air was repeated; after which the
muſic was heard no more. If before
Julia believed that ſhe was loved by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0793800201:56"/>
Hippolitus, ſhe was now confirmed in
the ſweet reality. But ſleep at length
fell upon her ſenſes, and the airy forms
of ideal bliſs no longer fleeted before
her imagination. Morning came, and
ſhe aroſe light and refreſhed. How
different were her preſent ſenſations
from thoſe of the preceding day. Her
anxiety had now evaporated in joy, and
ſhe experienced that airy dance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
which accumulates delight from
every object; and with a power like the
touch of enchantment, can transform
a gloomy deſert into a ſmiling Eden.
She flew to the breakfaſt room, ſcarcely
conſcious of motion; but, as ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, a ſoft confuſion overcame her;
ſhe bluſhed, and almoſt feared to meet
the eyes of Vereza. She was preſently
relieved, however, for the count was
not there. The company aſſembled—Julia
watched the entrance of every
perſon with painful anxiety, but he for
whom ſhe looked did not appear. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0793800201:57"/>
and uneaſy, ſhe fixed her eyes on
the door, and whenever it opened, her
heart beat with an expectation which
was as often checked by diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In ſpite of all her efforts her
vivacity ſunk into languor, and ſhe
then perceived that love may produce
other ſenſations than thoſe of delight.
She found it poſſible to be unhappy,
though loved by Hippolitus; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
with a ſigh of regret, which
was yet new to her, how tremblingly
her peace depended upon him. He
neither appeared nor was mentioned at
breakfaſt; but though delicacy prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her enquiring after him, converſation
ſoon became irkſome to her, and ſhe
retired to the apartment of Madame de
Menon. There ſhe employed herſelf
in painting, and endeavoured to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
the time till the hour of dinner,
when ſhe hoped to ſee Hippolitus.
Madame was, as uſual, friendly and
cheerful, but ſhe perceived a reſerve in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0793800201:58"/>
in the conduct of Julia, and penetrated
without difficulty into its cauſe. She
was, however, ignorant of the object of
her pupil's admiration. The hour ſo
eagerly deſired by Julia at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
and with a palpitating heart ſhe
entered the hall. The count was not
there, and in the courſe of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhe learned that he had that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſailed for Naples. The ſcene which
ſo lately appeared enchanting to her eyes,
now changed its hue; and in the midſt
of ſociety, and ſurrounded by gaiety,
ſhe was ſolitary and dejected. She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
herſelf of having ſuffered her wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to miſlead her judgment; and the
preſent conduct of Hippolitus convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her, that ſhe had miſtaken admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for a ſentiment more tender. She
believed too, that the muſician who
had addreſſed her in his ſonnet, was not
the count; and thus at once was diſſolved
all the ideal fabrick of her happineſs.
How ſhort a period often reverſes the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0793800201:59"/>
character of our ſentiments, rendering
that which yeſterday we deſpiſed, to day
deſirable. The tranquil ſtate which ſhe
had ſo lately delighted to quit, ſhe now
reflected upon with regret. She had,
however, the conſolation of believing
that her ſentiments towards the count
were unknown, and the ſweet conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that her conduct had been govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a nice ſenſe of propriety.</p>
               <p>The public rejoicings at the caſtle
cloſed with the week; but the gay ſpirit
of the marchioneſs forbade a return
to tranquillity; and ſhe ſubſtituted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
more private, but in ſplendour
ſcarcely inferior to the preceding ones.
She had obſerved the behaviour of Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus
on the night of the concert with
chagrin, and his departure with ſorrow;
yet diſdaining to perpetuate misfortune
by reflection, ſhe ſought to loſe the
ſenſe of diſappointment in the hurry of
diſſipation. But her efforts to eraſe him
from her remembrance were ineffectual.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0793800201:60"/>
Unaccuſtomed to oppoſe the bent of
her inclinations, they now maintained
unbounded ſway; and ſhe found too
late, that in order to have a due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of our paſſions, it is neceſſary to
ſubject them to early obedience. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
in its undue influence, produces
weakneſs as well as injuſtice. The pain
which now recoiled upon her heart from
diſappointment, ſhe had not ſtrength of
mind to endure, and ſhe ſought relief
from its preſſure in afflicting the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
Julia, whoſe beauty ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
had captivated the count, and
confirmed him in indifference towards
herſelf, ſhe inceſſantly tormented by
the exerciſe of thoſe various and
ſplenetic little arts, which elude the
eye of the common obſerver, and
are only to be known by thoſe who
have ſelt them. Arts, which indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
are inconſiderable, but in the
aggregate, amount to a cruel and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0793800201:61"/>
From Julia's mind the idea of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was now faded. Pleaſure had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
her beam from the proſpect,
and the objects no longer illumined by
her ray, became dark and colourleſs.
As often as her ſituation would permit,
ſhe withdrew from ſociety, and ſought
the freedom of ſolitude, where ſhe could
indulge in melancholy thoughts, and
give a looſe to that deſpair which is ſo
apt to follow the diſappointment of our
firſt hopes.</p>
               <p>Week after week elapſed, yet no
mention was made of returning to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
The marquis at length declared
it his intention to ſpend the remainder
of the ſummer in the caſtle. To this
determination the marchioneſs ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with decent reſignation, for ſhe was
here ſurrounded by a croud of ſlatterers,
and her invention ſupplied her with
continual diverſions: that gaiety which
rendered Naples ſo dear to her, glittered
in the woods of Mazzini, and reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through the caſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0793800201:62"/>
The apartments of Madame de Menon
were ſpacious and noble. The windows
opened upon the ſea, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a view of the ſtraits of Meſſina,
bounded on one ſide by the beautiful
ſhores of the iſle of Sicily, and on the
other by the high mountains of Calabria.
The ſtraits, filled with veſſels whoſe
gay ſtreamers glittered to the ſun beam,
preſented to the eye an ever moving
ſcene. The principal room opened upon
a gallery that overhung the grand ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race
of the caſtle, and it commanded a
proſpect which for beauty and extent
has ſeldom been equalled. Theſe were
formerly conſidered the chief apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the caſtle; and when the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
quitted them for Naples, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
for the reſidence of Madame de
Menon, and her young charge. The
marchioneſs, ſtruck with the proſpect
which the windows afforded, and with
the pleaſantneſs of the gallery, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to reſtore the rooms to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0793800201:63"/>
ſplendour. She ſignified this inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Madame, for whom other apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were provided. The chambers
of Emilia and Julia forming part of the
ſuit, they were alſo claimed by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs,
who left Julia only her favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
cloſet. The rooms to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
were ſpacious but gloomy; they
had been for ſome years uninhabited;
and though preparations had been made
for the reception of their new inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
an air of deſolation reigned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them that inſpired melancholy ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Julia obſerved that her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which opened beyond Madame's,
formed a part of the ſouthern building,
with which, however, there appeared
no means of communication. The late
myſterious circumſtances relating to
this part of the fabric, now aroſe to
her imagination, and conjured up a
terror which reaſon could not ſubdue.
She told her emotions to Madame, who,
with more prudence than ſincerity,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0793800201:64"/>
laughed at her fears. The behaviour
of the marquis, the dying words of
Vincent, together with the preceding
circumſtances of alarm, had ſunk deep
in the mind of Madame, but ſhe ſaw
the neceſſity of confining to her own
breaſt, doubts which time only could
reſolve.</p>
               <p>Julia endeavoured to reconcile her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the change, and a circumſtance
ſoon occurred which obliterated her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſenſations, and excited others far
more intereſting. One day that ſhe was
arranging ſome papers in the ſmall
drawers of a cabinet that ſtood in her
apartment, ſhe found a picture which
fixed all her attention. It was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niature
of a lady, whoſe countenance
was touched with ſorrow, and expreſſed
an air of dignified reſignation. The
mournful ſweetneſs of her eyes, raiſed
towards Heaven with a look of ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and the melancholy languor
that ſhaded her features, ſo deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0793800201:65"/>
Julia, that her eyes were filled
with involuntary tears. She ſighed and
wept, ſtill gazing on the picture, which
ſeemed to engage her by a kind of
faſcination. She almoſt fancied that
the portrait breathed, and that the eyes
were fixed on her's with a look of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
ſoftneſs. Full of the emotions
which the miniature had excited, ſhe
preſented it to Madame, whoſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
ſorrow and ſurprize increaſed her
curioſity. But what where the various
ſenſations which preſſed upon her heart,
on learning that ſhe had wept over the
reſemblance of her mother! Deprived
of a mother's tenderneſs before ſhe
was ſenſible of its value, it was now
only that ſhe mourned the event which
lamentation could not recall. Emilia,
with an emotion as exquiſite, mingled
her tears with thoſe of her ſiſter. With
eager impatience they preſſed Madame
to diſcloſe the cauſe of that ſorrow
which ſo emphatically marked the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of their mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0793800201:66"/>
"Alas! my dear children," ſaid
Madame, deeply ſighing, "you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
me in a taſk too ſevere, not only
for your peace, but for mine; ſince, in
giving you the information you require,
I muſt retrace ſcenes of my own life,
which I wiſh for ever obliterated. It
would, however, be both cruel and
unjuſt to with-hold an explanation ſo
nearly intereſting to you, and I will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
my own eaſe to your wiſhes."</p>
               <p>"Louiſa de Bernini, your mother,
was as you well know the only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the count de Bernini. Of the
misfortunes of your family, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
yon are yet ignorant. The chief
eſtates of the count were ſituated in the
<hi>Val di Demona,</hi> a valley deriving its
name from its vicinity to Mount Aetna,
which vulgar tradition has peopled with
devils. In one of thoſe dreadful erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Aetna, which deluged this valley
with a flood of fire, a great part of your
grandfather's domains in that quarter
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0793800201:67"/>
were laid waſte. The count was at that
time with a part of his family at Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina,
but the counteſs and her ſon, who
were in the country, were deſtroyed.
The remaining property of the count
was proportionably inconſiderable, and
the loſs of his wife and ſon deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
him. He retired with Louiſa,
his only ſurviving child, who was then
near fifteen, to a ſmall eſtate near Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania.
There was ſome degree of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionſhip
between your grandfather and
myſelf; and your mother was attached
to me by the ties of ſentiment, which,
as we grew up, united us ſtill more
ſtrongly than thoſe of blood. Our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and our taſtes were the ſame; and
a ſimilarity of misfortunes might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
contribute to cement our early
friendſhip. I, like herſelf, had loſt a
parent in the eruption of Aetna. My
mother had died before I underſtood
her value, but my father, whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and tenderly loved, was deſtroyed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0793800201:68"/>
by one of thoſe terrible events; his
lands were buried beneath the lava, and
he left an only ſon and myſelf to mourn
his fate, and encounter the evils of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.
The count, who was our neareſt
ſurviving relation, generouſly took us
home to his houſe, and declared that he
conſidered us as his children. To amuſe
his leiſure hours, he undertook to finiſh
the education of my brother, who was
then about ſeventeen, and whoſe riſing
genius promiſed to reward the labours
of the count. Louiſa and myſelf often
ſhared the inſtruction of her father, and
at thoſe hours Orlando was generally of
the party. The tranquil retirement of
the count's ſituation, the rational em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of his time between his own
ſtudies, the education of thoſe whom
he called his children, and the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of a few ſelect friends, anticipated
the effect of time, and ſoftened the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities
of his diſtreſs into a tender
complacent melancholy. As for Louiſa
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0793800201:69"/>
and myſelf, who were yet new in life,
and whoſe ſpirits poſſeſſed the happy
elaſticity of youth, our minds gradually
ſhifted from ſuffering to tranquillity,
and from tranquillity to happineſs. I have
ſometimes thought that when my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has been reading to her a delightful
paſſage, the countenance of Louiſa diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
a tender intereſt, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be excited rather by the reader
than by the author. Theſe days, which
were ſurely the moſt enviable of our
lives, now paſſed in ſerene enjoyments,
and in continual gradations of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
               <p>"The count deſigned my brother
for the army, and the time now drew
nigh when he was to join the Sicilian
regiment, in which he had a commiſſion.
The abſent thoughts, and dejected ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of my couſin, now diſcovered to
me the ſecret which had long been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
even from herſelf; for it was not
till Orlando was about to depart, that
ſhe perceived how dear he was to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0793800201:70"/>
her peace. On the eve of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
the count lamented with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly,
yet manly tenderneſs, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which was ſoon to ſeparate us.
"But we ſhall meet again," ſaid he,
"when the honours of war ſhall have
rewarded the bravery of my ſon." Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa
grew pale, a half ſuppreſſed ſigh eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
her, and to conceal her emotion
ſhe turned to her harpſichord."</p>
               <p>"My brother had a favourite dog
which, before he ſet off, he preſented
to Julia, and committing it to her care,
begged ſhe would be kind to it, and
ſometimes remember its maſter. He
checked his riſing emotion, but as he
turned from her, I perceived the tear
that wetted his cheek. He departed,
and with him the ſpirit of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſeemed to evaporate. The ſcenes
which his preſence had formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened,
were now forlorn and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
yet we loved to wander in what
were once his favourite haunts. Louiſa
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0793800201:71"/>
forbore to mention my brother even to
me, but frequently when ſhe thought
herſelf unobſerved, ſhe would ſteal to
her harpſichord, and repeat the ſtrain
which ſhe had played on the evening
before his departure."</p>
               <p>"We had the pleaſure to hear from
time to time that he was well; and
though his own modeſty threw a veil
over his conduct, we could collect
from other accounts that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
with great bravery. At length
the time of his return approached, and
the enlivened ſpirits of Julia declared
the influence he retained in her heart.
He returned, bearing public teſtimony
of his valour in the honours which had
been conferred upon him. He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with univerſal joy; the count
welcomed him with the pride and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a father, and the villa became
again the ſeat of happineſs. His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and manners were much improved;
the elegant beauty of the youth was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0793800201:72"/>
now exchanged for the graceful dignity
of manhood, and ſome knowledge of
the world was added to that of the
ſciences. The joy which illumined
his countenance when he met Julia,
ſpoke at once his admiration and his
love; and the bluſh which her obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of it brought upon her cheek,
would have diſcovered even to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted
ſpectator that this joy was
mutual."</p>
               <p>"Orlando brought with him a young
Frenchman, a brother officer, who had
reſcued him from imminent danger in
battle, and whom he introduced to the
count as his preſerver. The count re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him with gratitude and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and he was for a conſiderable time
an inmate at the villa. His manners
were ſingularly pleaſing, and his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
was cultivated and refined.
He ſoon diſcovered a partiality for me,
and he was indeed too pleaſing to be
ſeen with indifference. Gratitude for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0793800201:73"/>
the valuable life he had preſerved, was
perhaps the ground work of an eſteem
which ſoon increaſed into the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
love. Our attachment grew
ſtronger as our acquaintance increaſed;
and at length the chevalier de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
aſked me of the count, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
my heart, and finding it favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the connection, proceeded to
make the neceſſary enquiries concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the family of the ſtranger. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a ſatisfactory and pleaſing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it. The chevalier was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſon of a French gentleman of large
eſtates in France, who had been ſome
years deceaſed. He had left ſeveral
ſons; the family eſtate, of courſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
to the eldeſt, but to the two
younger he had bequeathed conſiderable
property. Our marriage was ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
in a private manner at the villa, in
the preſence of the count, Louiſa, and
my brother. Soon after the nuptials,
my huſband and Orlando were remand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0793800201:74"/>
to their regiments. My brother's
affections were now unalterably fixed
upon Louiſa, but a ſentiment of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
and generoſity ſtill kept him ſilent.
He thought, poor as he was, to ſolicit
the hand of Louiſa, would be to repay
the kindneſs of the count with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
I have ſeen the inward ſtruggles
of his heart, and mine has bled for him.
The count and Louiſa ſo earneſtly ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
me to remain at the villa during
the campaign, that at length my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
conſented. We parted—O! let
one forget that period!—Had I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
him, all might have been well;
and the long—long years of affliction
which followed had been ſpared me."</p>
               <p>The horn now ſounded the ſignal
for dinner, and interrupted the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Madame. Her beautious audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
wiped the tears from their eyes,
and with extreme reluctance deſcended
to the hall. The day was occupied
with company and diverſions, and it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0793800201:75"/>
was not till late in the evening that
they were ſuffered to retire. They
haſtened to Madame immediately upon
their being releaſed; and too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
for ſleep, and too importunate
to be repulſed, ſolicited the ſequel of
her ſtory. She objected the lateneſs of
the hour, but at length yielded to their
entreaties. They drew their chairs cloſe
to her's; and every ſenſe being abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſingle one of hearing, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
her through the courſe of her
narrative.</p>
               <p>"My brother again departed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſcloſing his ſentiments; the effort
it coſt him was evident, but his ſenſe
of honour ſurmounted every oppoſing
conſideration. Louiſa again drooped,
and pined in ſilent ſorrow. I lamented
equally for my friend and my brother;
and have a thouſand times accuſed that
delicacy as falſe, which with-held them
from the happineſs they might ſo eaſily
and ſo innocently have obtained. The
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0793800201:76"/>
behaviour of the count, at leaſt to my
eye, ſeemed to indicate the ſatisfaction
which this union would have given him.
It was about this period that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
Mazzini firſt ſaw and became ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
of Louiſa. His propoſals were
very flattering, but the count forbore to
exert the undue authority of a father;
and he ceaſed to preſs the connection,
when he perceived that Louiſa was really
averſe to it. Louiſa was ſenſible of the
generoſity of his conduct, and ſhe could
ſcarcely reject the alliance without a
ſigh, which her gratitude paid to the
kindneſs of her father."</p>
               <p>"But an event now happened which
diſſolved at once our happineſs, and all
our air drawn ſchemes for futurity. A
diſpute, which it ſeems originated in a
trifle, but ſoon increaſed to a ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
aroſe between the <hi>Chevalier de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
and my brother. It was decided
by the ſword, and my dear brother fell
by the hand of my huſband. I ſhall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0793800201:77"/>
paſs over this period of my life. It is
too painful for recollection. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of this event upon Louiſa was ſuch
as may imagined. The world was now
become indifferent to her, and as ſhe
had no proſpect of happineſs for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſhe was unwilling to with-hold it
from the father who had deſerved ſo
much of her. After ſome time, when
the marquis renewed his addreſſes, ſhe
gave him her hand. The characters of
the marquis and his lady were in their
nature too oppoſite to form a happy
union. Of this Louiſa was very ſoon
ſenſible; and though the mildneſs of
her diſpoſition made her tamely ſubmit
to the unfeeling authority of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
his behaviour ſunk deep in her
heart, and ſhe pined in ſecret. It was
impoſſible for her to avoid oppoſing the
character of the marquis to that of him
upon whom her affections had been ſo
fondly and ſo juſtly fixed. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
increaſed her ſufferings, which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0793800201:78"/>
ſoon preyed upon her conſtitution, and
very viſibly affected her health. Her
ſituation deeply afflicted the count, and
united with the infirmities of age to
ſhorten his life."</p>
               <p>"Upon his death, I bade adieu to
my couſin, and quitted Sicily for Italy,
where the Chevalier de Menon had for
ſome time expected me. Our meeting
was very affecting. My reſentment
towards him was done away, when I
obſerved his pale and altered counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and perceived the melancholy
which preyed upon his heart. All the
airy vivacity of his former manner was
fled, and he was devoured by unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grief and remorſe. He deplored
with unceaſing ſorrow the friend he
had murdered, and my preſence ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to open a freſh the wounds which
time had begun to cloſe. His afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
united with my own, was almoſt
more than I could ſupport, but I was
doomed to ſuffer, and endure yet more.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0793800201:79"/>
In a ſubſequent engagement my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
weary of exiſtence, ruſhed into
the heat of battle, and there obtained
an honourable death. In a paper which
he left behind him, he ſaid it was his
intention to die in that battle; that he
had long wiſhed for death, and waited
for an opportunity of obtaining it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtaining his own character by the
cowardice of ſuicide, or diſtreſſing me
by an act of butchery. This event
gave the finiſhing ſtroke to my afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;—yet
let me retract:—another
misfortune awaited me when I leaſt
expected one. The <hi>Chevalier de Menon</hi>
died without a will, and his brothers
refuſed to give up his eſtate, unleſs I
could produce a witneſs of my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
I returned to Sicily, and to my
inexpreſſible ſorrow found that your
mother had died during my ſtay abroad,
a prey, I fear, to grief. The prieſt who
performed the ceremony of my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
having been threatened with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0793800201:80"/>
puniſhment for ſome eccleſiaſtical of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
had ſecretly left the country;
and thus was I deprived of thoſe proofs
which were neceſſary to authenticate
my claims to the eſtates of my huſband.
His brothers, to whom I was an utter
ſtranger, were either too prejudiced to
believe, or believing, were too diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to acknowledge the juſtice of
my claims. I was therefore at once
abandoned to ſorrow and to poverty;
a ſmall legacy from the count de Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini
being all that now remained to
me."</p>
               <p>"When the marquis married Maria
de Vellorno, which was about this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
he deſigned to quit Mazzini for
Naples. His ſon was to accompany
him, but it was his intention to leave
you, who were both very young, to the
care of ſome perſon qualified to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend
your education. My circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
rendered the office acceptable,
and my former friendſhip for your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0793800201:81"/>
made the duty pleaſing to me.
The marquis, was, I believe, glad to be
ſpared the trouble of ſearching further
for what he had hitherto found it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to obtain—a perſon whom incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as well as duty would bind to
his intereſt."</p>
               <p>Madame ceaſed to ſpeak, and Emilia
and Julia wept to the memory of the
mother, whoſe misfortunes this ſtory
recorded. The ſufferings of Madame,
together with her former friendſhip for
the late marchioneſs, endeared her to
her pupils, who from this period endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by every kind and delicate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to obliterate the traces of her
ſorrows. Madame was ſenſible of this
tenderneſs, and it was productive in
ſome degree of the effect deſired. But
a ſubject ſoon after occurred, which
drew off their minds from the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of their mother's fate to a ſubject
more wonderful and equally intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0793800201:82"/>
One night that Emilia and Julia had
been detained, by company, in ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
reſtraint, later than uſual, they were
induced by the eaſy converſation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
and by the pleaſure which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to liberty naturally produces, to
defer the hour of repoſe till the night
was far advanced. They were engaged
in intereſting diſcourſe, when Madame,
who was then ſpeaking, was interrupted
by a low hollow ſound, which aroſe from
beneath the apartment, and ſeemed like
the cloſing of a door. Chilled into a
ſilence, they liſtened and diſtinctly heard
it repeated. Deadly ideas crowded upon
their imaginations, and inſpired a terror
which ſcarcely allowed them to breathe.
The noiſe laſted only for a moment,
and a profound ſilence ſoon enſued.
Their feelings at length relaxed, and
ſuffered them to move to Madame's
apartment, when again they heard the
ſame ſounds. Almoſt diſtracted with
fear, they ruſhed into Madame's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0793800201:83"/>
where Emilia ſunk upon the bed
and fainted. It was a conſiderable time
ere the efforts of Madame recalled her
to ſenſation. When they were again
tranquil, ſhe employed all her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to compoſe the ſpirits of the
young ladies, and diſſuade them from
alarming the caſtle. Involved in dark
and fearful doubts, ſhe yet commanded
her feelings, and endeavoured to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
an apperance of compoſure. The
late behaviour of the marquis had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
her that he was nearly connected
with the myſtery which hung over this
part of the edifice; and ſhe dreaded to
excite his reſentment by a further men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of alarms, which were perhaps only
ideal, and whoſe reality ſhe had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
no means of proving.</p>
               <p>Influenced by theſe conſiderations,
ſhe endeavoured to prevail on Emilia
and Julia, to await in ſilence ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their ſurmiſes, but their
terror made this a very difficult taſk.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0793800201:84"/>
They acquieſced, however, ſo far with
her wiſhes, as to agree to conceal the
preceding circumſtances from every
perſon but their brother, without whoſe
protecting preſence they declared it
utterly impoſſible to paſs another
night in the apartments. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of this night they reſolved to
watch. To beguile the tediouſneſs of
the time they endeavoured to converſe,
but the minds of Emilia and Julia were
too much affected by the late occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to wander from the ſubject. They
compared this with the foregoing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of the figure and the light
which had appeared; their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
kindled wild conjectures, and they
ſubmitted their opinions to Madame,
entreating her to inform them ſincerely,
whether ſhe believed that diſembodied
ſpirits were ever permitted to viſit this
earth.</p>
               <p>"My children," ſaid ſhe, "I will
not attempt to perſuade you that the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0793800201:85"/>
exiſtence of ſuch ſpirits is impoſſible.
Who ſhall ſay that any thing is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to God? We know that he has
made us, who are embodied ſpirits; he,
therefore, can make unembodied ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
If we cannot underſtand how ſuch
ſpirits exiſt, we ſhould conſider the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
powers of our minds, and that
we can not underſtand many things
which are indiſputably true. No one
yet knows why the magnetic needle
points to the north; yet you, who have
never ſeen a magnet, do not heſitate to
believe that it has this tendency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you have been well aſſured of it,
both from books and in converſation.
Since, therefore, we are ſure that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is impoſſible to God, and that
ſuch beings <hi>may</hi> exiſt, though we can
not tell how, we ought to conſider by
what evidence their exiſtence is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.
I do not ſay that ſpirits <hi>have</hi>
appeared; but if ſeveral diſcreet unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
perſons were to aſſure me that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0793800201:86"/>
they had ſeen one, I ſhould not to be
proud or bold enough to reply—"it is
impoſſible." Let not, however, ſuch
conſiderations diſturb your minds. I
have ſaid thus much, becauſe I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to impoſe upon your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
it is now your part to exerciſe
your reaſon, and preſerve the unmoved
confidence of virtue. Such ſpirits, if
indeed they have ever been ſeen, can
have appeared only by the expreſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of God, and for ſome very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
purpoſes; be aſſured that there
are no beings who act unſeen by him;
and that, therefore, there are none from
whom innocence can ever ſuffer harm."</p>
               <p>No further ſounds diſturbed them for
that time; and before the morning
dawned, wearineſs inſenſibly overcame
apprehenſion, and ſunk them in repoſe.</p>
               <p>When Ferdinand learned the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
relating to the ſouthern ſide of
the caſtle, his imagination ſeized with
avidity each appearance of myſtery,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0793800201:87"/>
and inſpired him with an irreſiſtible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to penetrate the ſecrets of this deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
part of the fabrick. He very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
conſented to watch with his ſiſters
in Julia's apartment; but as his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was in a remote part of the caſtle,
there would be ſome difficulty in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
unobſerved to her's. It was agreed,
however, that when all was huſhed, he
ſhould make the attempt. Having thus
reſolved, Emilia and Julia waited the
return of night with reſtleſs and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
impatience.</p>
               <p>At length the family retired to reſt.
The caſtle clock had ſtruck one, and
Julia began to fear that Ferdinand had
been diſcovered, when a knocking was
heard at the door of the outer chamber.</p>
               <p>Her heart beat with apprehenſions,
which reaſon could not juſtify. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
roſe, and enquiring who was there,
was anſwered by the voice of Ferdinand.
The door was chearfully opened. They
drew their chairs round him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0793800201:88"/>
to paſs the time in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but fear and expectation attracted
all their thoughts to one ſubject, and
Madame alone preſerved her compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
The hour was now come when
the ſounds had been heard the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
night, and every ear was given to
attention. All, however, remained
quiet, and the night paſſed without any
new alarm.</p>
               <p>The greater part of ſeveral ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nights were ſpent in watching, but
no ſounds diſturbed their ſilence. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,
in whoſe mind the late circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
had excited a degree of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and curioſity ſuperior to common
obſtacles, determined, if poſſible, to
gain admittance to thoſe receſſes of the
caſtle which had for ſo many years
been hid from human eye. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
was a deſign which he ſaw little
probability of accompliſhing, for the
keys of that part of the edifice were in
the poſſeſſion of the marquis, of whoſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0793800201:89"/>
late conduct he judged too well to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he would ſuffer the apartments to
be explored. He racked his invention
for the means of getting acceſs to them,
and at length recollecting that Julia's
chamber formed a part of theſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
it occurred to him, that according
to the mode of building in old times,
there might formerly have been a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
between them. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
ſuggeſted to him the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a concealed door in her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and he determined to ſurvey it
on the following night with great care.</p>

               <p>THE caſtle was buried in ſleep when
Ferdinand again joined his ſiſters
in Madame's apartment. With anxious
curioſity they followed him to the
chamber. The room was hung with
tapeſtry. Ferdinand carefully ſounded
the wall which communicated with
the ſouthern buildings. From one part
of it a ſound was returned, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him there was ſomething leſs
ſolid than ſtone. He removed the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry,
and behind it appeared, to his
inexpreſſible ſatisfaction, a ſmall door.
With a hand trembling through eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
he undrew the bolts, and was
ruſhing forward, when he perceived
that a lock with-held his paſſage. The
keys of Madame and his ſiſters were
applied in vain, and he was compelled
to ſubmit to diſappointment at the very
moment when he congratulated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0793800201:91"/>
on ſucceſs, for he had with him no
means of forcing the door.</p>
               <p>He ſtood gazing on the door, and
inwardly lamenting, when a low hollow
ſound was heard from beneath. Emilia
and Julia ſeized his arm; and almoſt
ſinking with apprehenſion, liſtened in
profound ſilence. A footſtep was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly
heard, as if paſſing through the
apartment below, after which all was
ſtill. Ferdinand fired by this confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the late report, ruſhed on to the
door, and again tried to burſt his way,
but it reſiſted all the efforts of his
ſtrength. The ladies now rejoiced in
that circumſtance which they ſo lately
lamented; for the ſounds had renewed
their terror, and though the night
paſſed without further diſturbance, their
fears were very little abated.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand, whoſe mind was wholly
occupied with wonder, could with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
await the return of night. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
and Julia were ſcarcely leſs impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0793800201:92"/>
They counted the minutes as they
paſſed; and when the family retired to
reſt, haſtened with palpitating hearts to
the apartment of Madame. They were
ſoon after joined by Ferdinand, who
brought with him tools for cutting away
the lock of the door. They pauſed a
few moments in the chamber in fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſilence, but no ſound diſturbed the
ſtillneſs of night. Ferdinand applied a
knife to the door, and in a ſhort time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
the lock. The door yielded,
and diſcloſed a large and gloomy gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.
He took a light. Emilia and
Julia, fearful of remaining in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
reſolved to accompany him, and
each ſeizing an arm of Madame, they
followed in ſilence. The gallery was
in many parts falling to decay, the ceil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was broke, and the window ſhutters
ſhattered, which, together with the
dampneſs of the walls, gave the place
an air of wild deſolation.</p>
               <p>They paſſed lightly on, for their ſteps
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0793800201:93"/>
ran in whiſpering echos through the
gallery, and often did Julia caſt a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
glance around.</p>
               <p>The gallery terminated in a large old
ſtair-caſe, which led to a hall below;
on the left appeared ſeveral doors which
ſeemed to lead to ſeparate apartments.
While they heſitated which courſe to
purſue, a light flaſhed faintly up the
ſtair-caſe, and in a moment after paſſed
away; at the ſame time was heard the
ſound of a diſtant footſtep. Ferdinand
drew his ſword and ſprang forward; his
companions ſcreaming with terror, ran
back to Madame's apartment.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand deſcended a large vaulted
hall; he croſſed it towards a low arched
door which was left half open, and
through which ſtreamed a ray of light.
The door opened upon a narrow winding
paſſage; he entered, and the light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring,
was quickly loſt in the windings
of the place. Still he went on. The
paſſage grew narrower, and the frequent
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0793800201:94"/>
fragments of looſe ſtone, made it now
difficult to proceed. A low door cloſed
the avenue, reſembling that by which
he had entered. He opened it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
a ſquare room, from whence
roſe a winding ſtair-caſe, which led up
the ſouth tower of the caſtle. Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
pauſed to liſten; the ſound of
ſteps was ceaſed, and all was profoundly
ſilent. A door on the right attracted
his notice; he tried to open it, but it was
faſtened. He concluded, therefore,
that the perſon, if indeed a human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was that bore the light he had
ſeen, had paſſed up the tower. After a
momentary heſitation, he determined to
aſcend the ſtair-caſe, but its ruinous
condition made this an adventure of
ſome difficulty. The ſteps were decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and broken, and the looſeneſs of the
ſtones rendered a footing very inſecure.
Impelled by an irreſiſtible curioſity, he
was undiſmayed and began the aſcent.
He had not proceeded very far, when the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0793800201:95"/>
ſtones of a ſtep which his foot had juſt
quitted, looſened by his weight, gave
way; and draging with them thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining,
formed a chaſm in the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe
that terrified even Ferdinand, who
was left tottering on the ſuſpended half
of the ſteps, in momentary expectation
of falling to the bottom with the ſtone
on which he reſted. In the terror which
this occaſioned, he attempted to ſave
himſelf by catching at a kind of beam
which projected over the ſtairs, when
the lamp dropped from his hand, and he
was left in total darkneſs. Terror now
uſurped the place of every other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and he was utterly perplexed how
to proceed. He feared to go on, leſt the
ſteps above, as infirm as thoſe below,
ſhould yield to his weight;—to return
was impracticable, for the darkneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the poſſibility of diſcovering a
means. He determined, therefore, to
remain in this ſituation till light ſhould
dawn through the narrow grates in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0793800201:96"/>
walls, and enable him to contrive ſome
method of letting himſelf down to the
ground.</p>
               <p>He had remained here above an hour,
when he ſuddenly heard a voice from
below. It ſeemed to come from the
paſſage leading to the tower, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly
drew nearer. His agitation
was now extreme, for he had no power
of defending himſelf, and while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the ſtate of torturing expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
a blaze of light burſt upon the
ſtair-caſe beneath him. In the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moment he heard his own name
ſounded from below. His apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
inſtantly vaniſhed, for he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
the voices of Madame and his
ſiſters.</p>
               <p>They had awaited his return in all
the horrors of apprehenſion, till at
length all fear for themſelves was loſt
in their concern for him; and they, who
ſo lately had not dared to enter this part
of the edifice, now undauntedly ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in queſt of Ferdinand. What
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0793800201:97"/>
were their emotions when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his perilous ſituation!</p>
               <p>The light now enabled him to take
a more accurate ſurvey of the place.
He perceived that ſome few ſtones of
the ſteps which had fallen, ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
attached to the wall, but he feared
to trust to their ſupport only. He  ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
however, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> worn
ſtones. On theſe ſmall projections he
contrived, with the aſſiſtance of the ſteps
already mentioned, to ſuſpend himſelf,
and at length gained the unbroken part
of the ſtairs in ſafety. It is difficult to
determine which individual of the party
rejoiced moſt at this eſcape. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now dawned, and Ferdinand deſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the preſent from farther enquiry.</p>
               <p>The intereſt which theſe myſterious
circumſtances excited in the mind of
Julia, had with-drawn her attention
from a ſubject more dangerous to its
peace. The image of Vereza, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0793800201:98"/>
would frequently intrude upon
her fancy; and awakening the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of happy emotions, would call
forth a ſigh which all her efforts could
not ſuppreſs. She loved to indulge the
melancholy of her heart in the ſolitude
of the woods. One evening ſhe took
her lute to a favourite ſpot on the ſea
ſhore, and reſigning herſelf to a pleaſing
ſadneſs, touched ſome ſweet and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
airs. The purple fluſh of evening
was diffuſed over the heavens. The
ſun, involved in clouds of ſplendid and
innumerable hues, was ſetting o'er the
diſtant waters, whoſe clear boſom glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with rich reflection. The beauty of
the ſcene, the ſoothing murmur of the
high trees, waved by the light air
which overſhadowed her, and the ſoft
ſhelling of the waves that flowed gently
in upon the ſhores, inſenſibly ſunk her
mind into a ſtate of repoſe. She touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the chords of her lute in ſweet and
wild melody, and ſung the following ode:</p>

               <p>Having ceaſed to ſing, her fingers
wandered over the lute in melancholy
ſymphony, and for ſome moments ſhe
remained loſt in the ſweet ſenſations
which the muſic and the ſcenery had
inſpired. She was awakened from her
reverie, by a ſigh that ſtole from among
the trees, and directing her eyes whence
it came, beheld—Hippolitus! A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0793800201:101"/>
ſand ſweet and mingled emotions preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon her heart, yet ſhe ſcarcely dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to truſt the evidence of ſight. He
advanced, and throwing himſelf at her
feet. "Suffer me" ſaid he, in a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous
voice, "to diſcloſe to you the
ſentiments which you have inſpired,
and to offer you the effuſions of a heart
filled only with love and admiration."
"Riſe my lord," ſaid Julia, moving
from her ſeat with an air of dignity,
"that attitude is neither becoming
you to uſe, or me to ſuffer. The even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is cloſing, and Ferdinand will be
impatient to ſee you."</p>
               <p>"Never will I riſe, Madam," replied
the count, with an impaſſioned air,
"till"—He was interrupted by the
marchioneſs, who at this moment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the grove. On obſerving the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the count ſhe was retiring.
"Stay Madam," ſaid Julia, almoſt
ſinking under her confuſion. "By no
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0793800201:102"/>
means," replied the marchioneſs in a
tone of irony, "my preſence would
only interrupt a very agreeable ſcene.
The count, I ſee, is willing to pay you
his earlieſt reſpects." Saying this ſhe
diſappeared, leaving Julia diſtreſſed
and offended, and the count provoked
at the intruſion. He attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the ſubject, but Julia haſtily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the ſteps of the marchioneſs, and
entered the caſtle.</p>
               <p>The ſcene ſhe had witneſſed, raiſed
in the marchioneſs a tumult of dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
emotions. Love, hatred, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,
raged by turns in her heart, and
defied all power of controul. Subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their alternate violence, ſhe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
a miſery more acute than any
ſhe had yet known. Her imagination,
invigorated by oppoſition, heightened to
her the graces of Hippolitus; her boſom
glowed with more intenſe paſſion, and
her brain was at length exaſperated
almoſt to madneſs.</p>

                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0793800201:103"/>
In Julia this ſudden and unexpected
interview excited a mingled emotion
of love and vexation, which did not
ſoon ſubſide. At length, however,
the delightful conſciouſneſs of Vereza's
love bore her high above every other
ſenſation; again the ſcene more brightly
glowed, and again her fancy overcame
the poſſibility of evil.</p>
               <p>During the evening, a tender and
timid reſpect diſtinguiſhed the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the count towards Julia, who,
contented with the certainty of being
loved, reſolved to conceal her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
till an explanation of his abrupt
departure from Mazzini, and ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
abſence, ſhould have diſſipated
the ſhadow of myſtery which hung over
this part of his conduct. She obſerved
that the marchioneſs purſued her with
ſteady and conſtant obſervation, and ſhe
carefully avoided affording the count an
opportunity of renewing the ſubject of
the preceding interview, which when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0793800201:104"/>
he approached her ſeemed to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
on his lips.</p>
               <p>Night returned, and Ferdinand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to the chamber of Julia to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
his enquiry. Here he had not long
remained, when the ſtrange and alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſounds which had been heard on
the preceding night were repeated.
The circumſtance that now ſunk in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
the minds of Emilia and Julia, fired
with new wonder that of Ferdinand,
who ſeizing a light, darted through the
diſcovered door, and almoſt inſtantly
diſappeared.</p>
               <p>He deſcended into the ſame wild
hall he had paſſed on the preceding
night. He had ſcarcely reached the
bottom of the ſtair-caſe, when a feeble
light gleamed acroſs the hall, and his eye
caught the glimpſe of a figure retiring
through the low arched door which led
to the ſouth tower. He drew his ſword
and ruſhed on. A faint found died
away along the paſſage, the windings of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0793800201:105"/>
which prevented his ſeeing the figure
he purſued. Of this, indeed, he had
obtained ſo ſlight a view, that he ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knew whether it bore the impreſſion
of a human form. The light quickly
diſappeared, and he heard the door that
opened upon the tower ſuddenly cloſe.
He reached it, and forcing it open,
ſprang forward; but the place was dark
and ſolitary, and there was no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of any perſon having paſſed along
it. He looked up the tower, and the
chaſm which the ſtair-caſe exhibited,
convinced him that no human being
could have paſſed up. He ſtood ſilent
and amazed; examining the place
with an eye of ſtrict enquiry, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a door, which was partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
by hanging ſtairs, and which
till now had eſcaped his notice. Hope
invigorated curioſity, but his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was quickly diſappointed, for this
door alſo was faſtened. He tried in
vain to force it. He knocked, and a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0793800201:106"/>
hollow ſullen ſound ran in echoes
through the place, and died away at
diſtance. It was evident that beyond
this door were chambers of conſiderable
extent, but after long and various at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to reach them, he was obliged
to deſiſt, and he quitted the tower as
ignorant and more diſſatisfied than he
had entered it. He returned to the
hall, which he now for the firſt time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
ſurveyed. It was a ſpacious
and deſolate apartment, whoſe lofty
roof roſe into arches ſupported by pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of black marble. The ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
inlaid the floor, and formed the
ſtair-cafe. The windows were high
and gothic. An air of proud ſublimity,
united with ſingular wildneſs, charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized
the place, at the extremity of
which aroſe ſeveral gothic arches, whoſe
dark ſhade veiled in obſcurity the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
beyond. On the left hand appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two doors, each of which was faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and on the right the grand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0793800201:107"/>
from the courts. Ferdinand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to explore the dark receſs
which terminated his view, and as he
traverſed the hall, his imagination, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the ſurrounding ſcene, often
multiplied the echoes of his footſteps
into uncertain ſounds of ſtrange and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
import.</p>
               <p>He reached the arches, and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beyond a kind of inner hall of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
extent, which was cloſed at the
farther end by a pair of maſſy folding
doors, heavily ornamented with carving.
They were faſtened by a lock, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his utmoſt ſtrength.</p>
               <p>As he ſurveyed the place in ſilent
wonder, a ſullen groan aroſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the ſpot where he ſtood. His
blood ran cold at the ſound, but ſilence
returning, and continuing unbroken, he
attributed his alarm to the illuſion of a
fancy, which terror had impregnated.
He made another effort to force the
door, when a groan was repeated more,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0793800201:108"/>
hollow, and more dreadful than the firſt.
At this moment all his courage forſook
him, he quitted the door, and haſtened
to the ſtair-caſe, which he aſcended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
breathleſs with terror.</p>
               <p>He found Madame de Menon and
his ſiſters awaiting his return in the moſt
painful anxiety; and, thus diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all his endeavours to penetrate
the ſecret of theſe buildings, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued
with fruitleſs ſearch, he reſolved
to ſuſpend farther enquiry.</p>
               <p>When he related the circumſtances
of his late adventure, the terror of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
and Julia was heightened to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that overcame every prudent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
Their apprehenſion of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's
diſpleaſure, was loſt in a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
feeling, and they reſolved no longer
to remain in apartments which offered
only terrific images to their fancy. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
de Menon almoſt equally alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and more perplexed, by this combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of ſtrange and unaccountable
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0793800201:109"/>
circumſtances, ceaſed to oppoſe their
deſign. It was reſolved, therefore, that
on the following day, Madame ſhould
acquaint the marchioneſs with ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of the late occurrences as their
purpoſe made it neceſſary ſhe ſhould
know, concealing their knowledge of
the hidden door, and the incidents im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
dependant on it; and that
Madame ſhould entreat a change of
apartments.</p>
               <p>Madame accordingly waited on the
marchioneſs. The marchioneſs having
liſtened to the account at firſt with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
and afterwards with indifference,
condeſcended to reprove Madame for
encouraging ſuperſtitious belief in the
minds of her young charge. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with ridiculing as fanciful the
circumſtances related, and with refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
on account of the numerous viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
at the caſtle, the requeſt preferred
to her.</p>
               <p>It is true the caſtle was crowded with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0793800201:110"/>
viſitors; the former apartments of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
de Menon were the only ones un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupied,
and theſe were in magnificent
preparation for the pleaſure of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs,
who was unaccuſtomed to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
her own wiſhes to the comfort of
thoſe around her. She therefore treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
lightly the ſubject, which, ſeriouſly
attended to, would have endangered
her new plan of delight.</p>
               <p>But Emilia and Julia were too ſeriouſly
terrified to obey the ſcruples of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
or to be eaſily repulſed. They
prevailed on Ferdinand to repreſent
their ſituation to the marquis.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Hippolitus, who had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the night in a ſtate of ſleepleſs anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety,
watched with buſy impatience,
an opportunity of more fully diſcloſing
to Julia, the paſſion which glowed in
his heart. The firſt moment in which
he beheld her, had awakened in him
an admiration which had ſince ripened
into a ſentiment more tender. He had
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0793800201:111"/>
been prevented formally declaring his
paſſion by the circumſtance which ſo
ſuddenly called him to Naples. This
was the dangerous illneſs of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
de Lomelli, his near and much
valued relation. But it was a taſk too
painful to depart in ſilence, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
to inform Julia of his ſentiments
in the air which ſhe heard ſo ſweetly ſung
beneath her window.</p>
               <p>When Hippolitus reached Naples
the marquis was yet living, but expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a few days after his arrival, leaving
the count heir to the ſmall poſſeſſions
which remained from the extravagance
of their anceſtors.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of adjuſting his rights
had till now detained him from Sicily,
whither he came for the ſole purpoſe of
declaring his love. Here unexpected
obſtacles awaited him. The jealous
vigilance of the marchioneſs, conſpired
with the delicacy of Julia, to with-hold
from him the opportunity he ſo anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſought.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0793800201:112"/>
When Ferdinand entered upon the
ſubject of the ſouthern buildings to the
marquis, he carefully avoided mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hidden door. The marquis
liſtened for ſome time to the relation in
gloomy ſilence, but at length aſſuming
an air of diſpleaſure, reprehended Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand
for yielding his confidence to
thoſe idle alarms, which he ſaid were
the ſuggeſtions of a timid imagination.
"Alarms," continued he, "which
will readily find admittance to the
weak mind of a woman, but which the
firmer nature of man ſhould diſdain.
Degenerate boy! Is it thus you reward
my care? Do I live to ſee my ſon the
ſport of every idle tale a woman may
repeat? Learn to truſt reaſon and your
ſenſes, and you will then be worthy of
my attention."</p>
               <p>The marquis was retiring, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand
now perceived it neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that he had himſelf witneſſed the
ſounds he mentioned. "Pardon me,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0793800201:113"/>
my lord," ſaid he, "in the late inſtance
I have been juſt to your command—my
ſenſes have been the only evidences
I have truſted. I have heard thoſe
ſounds which I can not doubt." The
marquis appeared ſhocked. Ferdinand
perceived the change, and urged the
ſubject ſo vigorouſly, that the marquis
ſuddenly aſſuming a look of grave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
commanded him to attend
him in the evening in his cloſet.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand in paſſing from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
met Hippolitus. He was pacing
the gallery in much ſeeming agitation,
but obſerving Ferdinand he advanced
to him. "I am ill at heart," ſaid he,
in a melancholy tone, "aſſiſt me with
your advice. We will ſtep into this
apartment where we can converſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruption."</p>
               <p>"You are not ignorant," ſaid he,
throwing himſelf into a chair, "of the
tender ſentiments which your ſiſter
Julia has inſpired. I entreat you by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0793800201:114"/>
that ſacred friendſhip which has ſo long
united us, to afford me an opportunity
of pleading my paſſion. Her heart,
which is ſo ſuſceptible of other impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
is, I fear, inſenſible to love. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
me, however, the ſatisfaction of
certainty upon a point where the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of ſuſpence are ſurely the moſt
intolerable."</p>
               <p>"Your penetration" replied Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,
"has for once forſaken you, elſe
you would now be ſpared the tortures
of which you complain, for you would
have diſcovered what I have long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that Julia regards you with a
partial eye."</p>
               <p>"Do not," ſaid Hippolitus, "make
diſappointment more terrible by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
neither ſuffer the partiality of
friendſhip to miſlead your judgment.
Your perceptions are affected by the
warmth of your feelings, and becauſe
you think I deſerve her diſtinction, you
believe I poſſeſs it. Alas! you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
yourſelf, but not me!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0793800201:115"/>
"The very reverſe," replied Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand;
"tis you who deceive yourſelf,
or rather it is the delicacy of the paſſion
which animates you, and which will
ever operate againſt your clear percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a truth in which your happineſs
is ſo deeply involved. Believe me, I
ſpeak not without reaſon;—ſhe loves
you."</p>
               <p>At theſe words Hippolitus ſtarted
from his ſeat, and claſping his hands in
fervent joy, "Enchanting ſounds!"
cried he, in a voice tenderly impaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
"<hi>could</hi> I but believe ye!—could I
<hi>but</hi> believe ye—this world were para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe!"</p>
               <p>During this exclamation, the emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Julia, who ſat in her cloſet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining,
can with difficulty be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
A door which opened into it from
the apartment where this converſation
was held, was only half cloſed. Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
with the pleaſure this declaration
excited, ſhe yet trembled with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0793800201:116"/>
left ſhe ſhould be diſcovered.
She hardly dared to breathe, much leſs
to move acroſs the cloſet to the door,
which opened upon the gallery, whence
ſhe might probably have eſcaped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed,
leſt the ſound of her ſtep ſhould
betray her. Compelled, therefore, to
remain where ſhe was, ſhe ſat in a ſtate
of fearful diſtreſs, which no colour of
language can paint.</p>
               <p>"Alas!" reſumed Hippolitus, "I
too eagerly admit the poſſibility of what
I wiſh. If you mean that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
believe you, confirm your aſſertion
by ſome proof." "Readily," rejoined
Ferdinand.</p>
               <p>The heart of Julia beat quick.</p>
               <p>"When you was ſo ſuddenly called
to Naples upon the illneſs of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
Lomelli, I marked her conduct
well, and in that read the ſentiments of
her heart. On the following morning,
I obſerved in her countenance a reſtleſs
anxiety which I had never ſeen before.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0793800201:117"/>
She watched the entrance of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with an eager expectation, which
was as often ſucceeded by evident
diſappointment. At dinner your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
was mentioned:—ſhe ſpilt the
wine ſhe was carrying to her lips, and
for the remainder of the day was ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and melancholy. I ſaw her inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
ſtruggles to conceal the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at her heart. Since that time ſhe
has ſeized every opportunity of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from company. The gaiety
with which ſhe was ſo lately charmed—charmed
her no longer; ſhe became
penſive, retired, and I have often heard
her ſinging in ſome lonely ſpot, the
moſt moving and tender airs. Your
return produced a viſible and inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
alteration; ſhe has now reſumed
her gaiety; and the ſoft confuſion of
her countenance, whenever you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
might alone ſuffice to convince
you of the truth of my aſſertion."</p>
               <p>"O! talk for ever thus!" ſighed Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0793800201:118"/>
"Theſe words are ſo ſweet,
ſo ſoothing to my ſoul, that I could
liſten till I forgot I had a wiſh beyond
them. Yes!—Ferdinand, theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
are not to be doubted, and
conviction opens upon my mind a flow
of extacy I never knew till now. O!
lead me to her, that I may ſpeak the
ſentiments which ſwell my heart."</p>
               <p>They aroſe, when Julia, who with
difficulty had ſupported herſelf, now
impelled by an irreſiſtible fear of inſtant
diſcovery, roſe alſo, and moved ſoftly
towards the gallery. The ſound of her
ſtep alarmed the count, who, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
leſt his converſation had been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
was anxious to be ſatisfied whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any perſon was in the cloſet. He
ruſhed in, and diſcovered Julia! She
caught at a chair to ſupport her trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
frame; and overwhelmed with
mortifying ſenſations, ſunk into it, and
hid her face in her robe. Hippolitus
threw himſelf at her feet, and ſeizing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0793800201:119"/>
her hand, preſſed it to his lips in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
ſilence. Some moments paſſed
before the confuſion of either would
ſuffer them to ſpeak. At length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
his voice, "Can you, Madam,
ſaid he, forgive this intruſion, ſo unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional?
or will it deprive me of that
eſteem which I have but lately ventured
to believe I poſſeſſed, and which I value
more than exiſtence itſelf. O! ſpeak my
pardon! Let me not believe that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
accident has deſtroyed my peace for
ever."—"If your peace, Sir, depends
upon a knowledge of my eſteem," ſaid
Julia, in a tremulous voice, "that
peace is already ſecure. If I wiſhed
even to deny the partiality I feel, it
would now be uſeleſs; and ſince I no
longer wiſh this, it would alſo be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful."
Hippolitus could only weep his
thanks over the hand he ſtill held.
"Be ſenſible, however, of the delicacy
of my ſituation," continued ſhe, riſing,
"and ſuffer me to withdraw." Saying this
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0793800201:120"/>
ſhe quitted the cloſet, leaving Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
overcome with this ſweet confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his wiſhes, and Ferdinand not
yet recovered from the painful ſurprize
which the diſcovery of Julia had exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
He was deeply ſenſible of the
confuſion he had occaſioned her, and
knew that apologies would not reſtore
the compoſure he had ſo cruelly yet
unwarily diſturbed.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand awaited the hour appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the marquis in impatient curioſity.
The ſolemn air which the marquis aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
when he commanded him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
had deeply impreſſed his mind.
As the time drew nigh, expectation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
and every moment ſeemed to
linger into hours. At length he repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the cloſet, where he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
long before the marquis entered.
The ſame chilling ſolemnity marked
his manner. He locked the door of
the cloſet, and ſeating himſelf, addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ferdinand as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0793800201:121"/>
"I am now going to repoſe in you
a confidence, which will ſeverely prove
the ſtrength of your honour. But before
I diſcloſe a ſecret, hitherto ſo carefully
concealed, and now reluctantly told,
you muſt ſwear to preſerve on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
an eternal ſilence. If you doubt
the ſteadineſs of your diſcretion—now
declare it, and ſave yourſelf from the
infamy, and the fatal conſequences,
which may attend a breach of your oath;—if,
on the contrary, you believe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
capable of a ſtrict integrity—now
accept the terms, and receive the ſecret
I offer." Ferdinand was awed by this
exordium—the impatience of curioſity
was for a while ſuſpended, and he he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> her he ſhould receive the
ſecret upon ſuch terms. At length he
ſignified hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, conſent, and the marquis
ariſing, drew his ſword from the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard.—"Here"
ſaid he, offering it to
Ferdinand, "ſeal your vows—ſwear by
this ſacred pledge of honour never to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0793800201:122"/>
repeat what I ſhall now reveal." Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand
bowed upon the ſword, and
raiſing his eyes to Heaven ſolemnly
ſwore. The marquis then reſumed his
ſeat, and proceeded.</p>
               <p>"You are not to learn that, about
a century ago, this caſtle was in the
poſſeſſion of Vincent, third marquis of
Mazzini, my grandfather. At that
time there exiſted an inveterate hatred
between our family and that of della
Campo. I ſhall not now revert to the
origin of the animoſity, or relate the
particulars of the conſequent feuds—ſuffice
it to obſerve, that by the power
of our family, the della Campos were
unable to preſerve their former conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in Sicily and they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
quitted it for a foreign land to live
in unmoleſted ſecurity. To return to
my ſubject.—My grandfather, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his life endangered by his enemy,
planted ſpies upon him. He employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome of the numerous banditti who
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0793800201:123"/>
ſought protection in his ſervice, and
after ſome weeks paſt in waiting for an
opportunity, they ſeized Henry della
Campo, and brought him ſecretly to this
caſtle. He was for ſome time confined
in a cloſe chamber of the ſouthern build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
where he expired; by what means
I ſhall forbear to mention. The plan
had been ſo well conducted, and the
ſecrecy ſo ſtrictly preſerved, that every
endeavour of his family to trace the
means of his diſappearance, proved
ineffectual. Their conjectures, if they
fell upon our family, were ſupported by
no proof; and the della Campo's are to
this day ignorant of the mode of his
death. A rumour had prevailed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the death of my father, that the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
buildings of the caſtle were haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I diſbelieved the fact, and treated it
accordingly. One night when every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
being of the caſtle, except myſelf,
was retired to reſt, I had ſuch ſtrong
and dreadful proofs of the general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0793800201:124"/>
that even at this moment I can
not recollect them without horror. Let
me, if poſſible, forget them. From
that moment I forſook thoſe buildings;
they have ever ſince been ſhut up, and
the circumſtance I have mentioned, is
the true reaſon why I have reſided ſo
little at the caſtle."</p>
               <p>Ferdinand liſtened to this narrative
in ſilent horror. He remembered the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity
with which he had dared to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
thoſe apartments—the light, and
figure he had ſeen—and, above all, his
ſituation in the ſtair-caſe of the tower.
Every nerve thrilled at the recollection;
and the terrors of remembrance almoſt
equalled thoſe of reality.</p>
               <p>The marquis permitted his daughters
to change their apartments, but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Ferdinand to tell them, that
in granting their requeſt, he conſulted
their eaſe only, and was himſelf by no
means convinced of its propriety. They
were accordingly re-inſtated in their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0793800201:125"/>
former chambers, and the great room
only of Madame's apartments was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
for the marchioneſs, who expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her diſcontent to the marquis in
terms of mingled cenſure and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The marquis privately reproved
his daughters, for what he termed the
idle fancies of a weak mind; and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them no more to diſturb the peace
of the caſtle with the ſubject of their
late fears. They received this reproof
with ſilent ſubmiſſion—too much pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſucceſs of their ſuit to be
ſuſceptible of any emotion but joy.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand, reflecting on the late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
was ſhocked to learn, what was
now forced upon his belief, that he was
the deſcendant of a murderer. He now
knew that innocent blood had been
ſhed in the caſtle, and that the walls
were ſtill the haunt of an unquiet ſpirit,
which ſeemed to call aloud for retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the poſterity of him who had
diſturbed its eternal reſt. Hippolitus
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0793800201:126"/>
perceived his dejection, and entreated
that he might participate his uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but Ferdinand, who had hitherto
been frank and ingenuous, was now
inflexibly reſerved. "Forbear," ſaid
he "to urge a diſcovery of what I am
not permitted to reveal; this is the only
point upon which I conjure you to be
ſilent, and this, even to you, I can not
explain." Hippolitus was ſurprized,
but preſſed the ſubject no farther.</p>
               <p>Julia, though ſhe had been extremely
mortified by the circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
on the diſcovery of her ſentiments
to Hippolitus, experienced, after the
firſt ſhock had ſubſided, an emotion
more pleaſing that painful. The late
converſation had painted in ſtrong co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
the attachment of her lover. His
diffidence—his ſlowneſs to perceive the
effect of his merit—his ſucceeding rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when conviction was at length
forced upon his mind; and his conduct
upon diſcovering Julia, proved to her
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0793800201:127"/>
at once the delicacy and the ſtrength of
his paſſion, and ſhe yielded her heart to
ſenſations of pure and unmixed delight.
She was rouſed from this ſtate of viſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
happineſs, by a ſummons from the
marquis to attend him in the library.
A circumſtance ſo unuſual ſurprized
her, and ſhe obeyed with trembling cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.
She found him pacing the room
in deep thought, and ſhe had ſhut the
door before he perceived her. The
authoritative ſeverity in his countenance
alarmed her, and prepared her for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of importance. He ſeated himſelf
by her, and continued a moment ſilent.
At length, ſteadily obſerving her, "I
ſent for you, my child," ſaid he, "to
declare the honour which awaits you.
The duke de Luovo has ſolicited your
hand. An alliance ſo ſplendid was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my expectation. You will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the diſtinction with the gratitude
it claims, and prepare for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the nuptials."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0793800201:128"/>
This ſpeech fell like the dart of death
upon the heart of Julia. She ſat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs—ſtupified
and deprived of the
power of utterance. The marquis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
her conſternation; and miſtaking
its cauſe, "I acknowledge," ſaid he,
"that there is ſomewhat abrupt in this
affair; but the joy occaſioned by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
ſo unmerited on your part,
ought to overcome the little feminine
weakneſs you might otherwiſe indulge.
Retire and compoſe yourſelf; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,"
continued he, in a ſtern voice,
"this is no time for fineſſe." Theſe
words rouſed Julia from her ſtate of
horrid ſtupefaction. "O! Sir," ſaid
ſhe, throwing herſelf at his feet, "for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to enforce authority upon a point
where to obey you would be worſe than
death; if, indeed, to obey you were
poſſible." "Ceaſe," ſaid the marquis,
"this affectation, and practiſe what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
you." "Pardon me, my lord,"
ſhe replied, "my diſtreſs is, alas! un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0793800201:129"/>
I cannot love the duke."
"Away," interrupted the marquis,
"nor tempt my rage with objections
thus childiſh and abſurd." "Yet hear
me, my lord," ſaid Julia, tears ſwelling
in her eyes, "and pity the ſufferings of
a child, who never till this moment
has dared to diſpute your commands."</p>
               <p>"Nor ſhall ſhe now," ſaid the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis.
"What—when wealth, honour,
and diſtinction are laid at my feet, ſhall
they be refuſed, becauſe a fooliſh girl—a
very baby, who knows not good from
evil, cries, and ſays ſhe cannot love.
Let me not think of it—My juſt anger
may, perhaps, out-run diſcretion, and
tempt me to chaſtiſe your folly.—At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to what I ſay—accept the duke,
or quit this caſtle for ever, and wander
where you will." Saying this, he burſt
away, and Julia, who had hung weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon his knees, fell proſtrate upon
the floor. The violence of the fall
completed the effect of her diſtreſs, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0793800201:130"/>
ſhe fainted. In this ſtate ſhe remained
a conſiderable time. When ſhe recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her ſenſes, the recollection of her
calamity burſt upon her mind with a
force that almoſt again overwhelmed
her. She at length raiſed herſelf from
the ground, and moved towards her
own apartment, but had ſcarcely reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the great gallery, when Hippolitus
entered it. Her trembling limbs would
no longer ſupport her;—ſhe caught at
a banniſter to ſave herſelf; and Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus,
with all his ſpeed, was ſcarcely in
time to prevent her falling. The pale
diſtreſs exhibited in her countenance
terrified him, and he anxiouſly enquired
concerning it. She could anſwer him
only with her tears, which ſhe found it
impoſſible to ſuppreſs; and gently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaging
herſelf, tottered to her cloſet.
Hippolitus followed her to the door,
but deſiſted from further importunity.
He preſſed her hand to his lips in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſilence, and withdrew ſurprized and
alarmed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0793800201:131"/>
Julia, reſigning herſelf to deſpair,
indulged in ſolitude the exceſs of her
grief. A calamity, ſo dreadful as the
preſent, had never before preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to her imagination. The union
propoſed would have been hateful to
her, even if ſhe had no prior attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
what then muſt have been her
diſtreſs, when ſhe had given her heart to
him who deſerved all her admiration,
and returned all her affection.</p>
               <p>The duke de Luovo was of a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
very ſimilar to that of the marquis.
The love of power was his ruling paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;—with
him no gentle or generous
ſentiment meliorated the harſhneſs of
authority, or directed it to acts of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.
He delighted in ſimple undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
tyranny. He had been twice
married, and the unfortunate women
ſubjected to his power, had fallen vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims
to the ſlow but corroding hand of
ſorrow. He had one ſon, who ſome
years before had eſcaped the tyranny of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0793800201:132"/>
his father, and had not been ſince heard
of. At the late feſtival the duke had
ſeen Julia; and her beauty made ſo
ſtrong an impreſſion upon him, that he
had been induced now to ſolicit her
hand. The marquis, delighted with the
proſpect of a connexion ſo flattering to
his favourite paſſion, readily granted
his conſent, and immediately ſealed it
with a promiſe.</p>
               <p>Julia remained for the reſt of the day
ſhut up in her cloſet, where the tender
efforts of Madame and Emilia were
exerted to ſoften her diſtreſs. Towards
the cloſe of evening Ferdinand entered.
Hippolitus, ſhocked at her abſence, had
requeſted him to viſit her, to alleviate
her affliction, and if poſſible to diſcover
its cauſe. Ferdinand, who tenderly loved
his ſiſter, was alarmed by the words of
Hippolitus, and immediately ſought her.
Her eyes were ſwelled with weeping, and
her countenance was but too expreſſive
of the ſtate of her mind. Ferdinand's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0793800201:133"/>
when told of his father's conduct,
was ſcarcely leſs than her own. He
had pleaſed himſelf with the hope of
uniting the ſiſter of his heart, with the
friend whom he loved. An act of cruel
authority now diſſolved the fairy dream
of happineſs which his fancy had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and deſtroyed the peace of thoſe
moſt dear to him. He ſat for a long
time ſilent and dejected; at length,
ſtarting from his melancholy reverie,
he bad Julia good night, and returned
to Hippolitus, who was waiting for him
with anxious impatience in the north
hall.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand dreaded the effect of that
deſpair, which the intelligence he had
to communicate would produce in the
mind of Hippolitus. He revolved ſome
means of ſoftening the dreadful truth;
but Hippolitus, quick to apprehend the
evil which love taught him to fear,
ſeized at once upon the reality. "Tell
me all," ſaid he, in a tone of aſſumed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0793800201:134"/>
firmneſs. "I am prepared for the
worſt." Ferdinand related the decree
of the marquis, and Hippolitus, ſoon
ſunk into an exceſs of grief which defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as much as it required, the powers
of alleviation.</p>
               <p>Julia, at length, retired to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but the ſorrow which occupied
her mind, with-held the bleſſings of
ſleep. Diſtracted and reſtleſs ſhe aroſe,
and gently opened the window of her
apartment. The night was ſtill, and
not a breath diſturbed the ſurface of the
waters. The moon ſhed a mild radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
over the waves, which in gentle
undulations ſlowed upon the ſands.
The ſcene inſenſibly tranquillized her
ſpirits. A tender and pleaſing melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
diffuſed itſelf over her mind; and
as ſhe muſed, ſhe heard the daſhing of
diſtant oars. Preſently the perceived
upon the light ſurface of the ſea a ſmall
boat. The ſound of the oars ceaſed,
and a ſolemn ſtrain of harmony (ſuch
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0793800201:135"/>
as fancy wafts from the abodes of the
bleſſed) ſtole upon the ſilence of night.
A chorus of voices now ſwelied upon
the air, and died away at diſtance. In
the ſtrain Julia recollected the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
hymn to the virgin, and holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm
filled her heart. The chorus
was repeated, accompanied by a ſolemn
ſtriking of oars. A ſigh of extacy ſtole
from her boſom. Silence returned.
The divine melody ſhe had heard calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the tumult of her mind, and ſhe ſunk
in ſweet repoſe.</p>
               <p>She aroſe in the morning refreſhed
by light ſlumbers; but the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her ſorrows ſoon returned with
new force, and ſickening faintneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
her. In this ſituation ſhe receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a meſſage from the marquis to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him inſtantly. She obeyed, and
he bade her prepare to receive the duke,
who that morning purpoſed to viſit the
caſtle. He commanded her to attire
herſelf richly, and to welcome him with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0793800201:136"/>
ſmiles. Julia ſubmitted in ſilence. She
ſaw the marquis was inflexibly reſolved,
and ſhe withdrew to indulge the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of her heart, and prepare for this
deteſted interview.</p>
               <p>The clock had ſtruck twelve, when
a flouriſh of trumpets announced the
approach of the duke. The heart of
Julia ſunk at the ſound, and ſhe threw
herſelf on a ſopha overwhelmed with
bitter ſenſations. Here ſhe was ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
by a meſſage from the marquis.
She aroſe, and tenderly embracing Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
their tears for ſome moments flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together At length ſummoning all
her fortitude, ſhe deſcended to the hall,
where ſhe was met by the marquis. He
led her to the ſaloon in which the duke
ſat, with whom having converſed a ſhort
time, he withdrew. The emotion of
Julia at this inſtant was beyond any
thing ſhe had before ſuffered; but by a
ſudden and ſtrange exertion of fortitude,
which the force of deſperate calamity
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0793800201:137"/>
ſometimes affords us, but which infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
forrow toils after in vain, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
her compoſure, and reſumed
her natural dignity. For a moment ſhe
wondered at herſelf, and ſhe formed the
dangerous reſolution of throwing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon the generoſity of the duke, by
acknowledging her reluctance to the
engagement, and ſoliciting him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his ſuit.</p>
               <p>The duke approached her with an
air of proud condeſcenſion; and taking
her hand, placed himſelf beſide her.
Having paid ſome formal and general
compliments to her beauty, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to profeſs himſelf her admirer. She
liſtened for ſome time to his profeſſions,
and when he appeared willing to hear
her, ſhe addreſſed him—"I am juſtly
ſenſible, my lord, of the diſtinction you
offer me, and muſt lament that reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
gratitude is the only ſentiment I can
return. Nothing can more ſtrongly
prove my confidence in your generoſity,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0793800201:138"/>
than when I confeſs to you, that paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
authority urges me to give my hand,
whither my heart can not accompany
it."</p>
               <p>She pauſed—the duke continued ſilent.—"'Tis
you only, my lord, who can
releaſe me from a ſituation ſo diſtreſſing;
and to your goodneſs and juſtice I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
certain that neceſſity will excuſe
the ſingularity of my conduct, and that
I ſhall not appeal in vain."</p>
               <p>The duke was embaraſſed—a fluſh
of pride overſpread his countenance,
and he ſeemed endeavouring to ſtifle
the feelings that ſwelled his heart. "I
had been prepared Madam," ſaid he,
"to expect a very different reception,
and had certainly no reaſon to believe
that the duke de Luovo was likely to ſue
in vain. Since, however, Madam, you
acknowledge that you have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of your affections, I ſhall certainly
be very willing, if the marquis will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
me from our mutual engagements,
to reſign you to a more favoured lover."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0793800201:139"/>
"Pardon me, my lord," ſaid Julia,
bluſhing, "ſuffer me to"—"I am
not eaſily deceived, Madam," interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the duke,—"your conduct can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
only to the influence of a prior
attachment; and though for ſo young
a lady, ſuch a circumſtance is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
extraordinary, I have certainly no
right to arraign your choice. Permit
me to wiſh you a good morning." He
bowed low, and quitted the room.
Julia now experienced a new diſtreſs; ſhe
dreaded the reſentment of the marquis,
when he ſhould be informed of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with the duke, of whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
ſhe now judged too juſtly not to
repent the confidence ſhe had repoſed
in him.</p>
               <p>The duke, on quitting Julia, went
to the marquis, with whom he remained
in converſation ſome hours. When he
had left the caſtle, the marquis ſent for
his daughter, and poured forth his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
with all the violence of threats,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0793800201:140"/>
and all the acrimony of contempt. So
ſeverely did he ridicule the idea of her
diſpoſing of her heart, and ſo dreadfully
did he denounce vengeance on her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
that ſhe ſcarcely thought her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſafe in his preſence. She ſtood trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and confuſed, and heard his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
without the power to reply.
At length the marquis informed her,
that the nuptials would be ſolemnized
on the third day from the preſent; and
as he quitted the room, a flood of tears
came to her relief, and ſaved her from
fainting.</p>
               <p>Julia paſſed the remainder of the day
in her cloſet with Emilia. Night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
but brought her no peace. She
ſat long after the departure of Emilia;
and to beguile recollection, ſhe ſelected
a favourite author, endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
thoſe ſenſations his page had once
excited. She opened to a paſſage, the
tender ſorrow of which was applicable
to her own ſituation, and her tears flowed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0793800201:141"/>
anew. Her grief was ſoon ſuſpended
by apprehenſion. Hitherto a deadly
ſilence had reigned through the caſtle,
interrupted only by the wind, whoſe
low ſound crept at intervals through
the galleries. She now thought ſhe
heard a foot-ſtep near her door, but
preſently all was ſtill, for ſhe believed
ſhe had been deceived by the wind.
The ſucceeding moment, however, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
her of her error, for ſhe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
the low whiſperings of ſome
perſons in the gallery. Her ſpirits, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
weakened by ſorrow, deſerted her;
ſhe was ſeized with an univerſal terror,
and preſently afterwards a low voice
called her from without, and the door
was opened by Ferdinand.</p>
               <p>She ſhrieked and fainted. On re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering,
ſhe found herſelf ſupported by
Ferdinand and Hippolitus, who had
ſtolen this moment of ſilence and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to gain admittance to her preſence.
Hippolitus came to urge a propoſal,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0793800201:142"/>
which deſpair only could have ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
"Fly," ſaid he, "from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a father who abuſes his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and aſſert the liberty of choice,
which nature aſſigned you. Let the
deſperate ſituation of my hopes plead
excuſe for the apparent boldneſs of this
addreſs, and let the man who exiſts but
for you, be the means of ſaving you from
deſtruction. Alas! Madam, you are
ſilent, and perhaps I have forfeited by
this propoſal, the confidence I ſo lately
flattered myſelf I poſſeſſed. If ſo, I
will ſubmit to my fate in ſilence, and
will to-morrow quit a ſcene which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
only images of diſtreſs to my mind.</p>
               <p>Julia could ſpeak but with her tears.
A variety of ſtrong and contending
emotions ſtruggled at her breaſt, and
ſuppreſſed the power of utterance. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand
ſeconded the propoſal of the
count. "It is unneceſſary," my ſiſter,
ſaid he, "to point out the miſery which
awaits you here. I love you too well
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0793800201:143"/>
tamely to ſuffer you to be ſacrificed to
ambition, and to a paſſion ſtill more
hateful. I now glory in calling Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus
my friend—let me ere long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him as a brother. I can give no
ſtronger teſtimony of my eſteem for his
character, than in the wiſh I now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.
Believe me he has a heart wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of your acceptance—a heart noble
and expanſive as your own." "Ah,
ceaſe," ſaid Julia, "to dwell upon a
character of whoſe worth I am fully
ſenſible. Your kindneſs and his merit
can never be forgotten by her whoſe
misfortunes you have ſo generouſly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to intereſt you." She pauſed in
ſilent heſitation. A ſenſe of delicacy
made her heſitate upon the deciſion
which her heart ſo warmly prompted.
If ſhe fled with Hippolitus, ſhe would
avoid one evil, and encounter another.
She would eſcape the dreadful deſtiny
awaiting her, but muſt, perhaps, fully
the purity of that reputation, which was
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0793800201:144"/>
dearer to her than exiſtence. In a mind
like her's, exquiſitely ſuſceptible of the
pride of honour, this fear was able
to counteract every other conſideration,
and to keep her intentions in a ſtate of
painful ſuſpence. She ſighed deeply,
and continued ſilent. Hippolitus was
alarmed by the calm diſtreſs which her
countenance exhibited. "O! Julia,"
ſaid he, "relieve me from this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſuſpenſe!—ſpeak to me—explain this
ſilence." She looked mournfully upon
him—her lips moved, but no ſounds
were uttered. As he repeated his queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhe waved her hand, and ſunk back
in her chair. She had not fainted, but
continued ſome time in a ſtate of ſtupor
not leſs alarming. The importance of
the preſent queſtion, operating upon
her mind, already haraſſed by diſtreſs,
had produced a temporary ſuſpenſion
of reaſon. Hippolitus hung over her in
an agony not be deſcribed, and Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
vainly repeated her name. At
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0793800201:145"/>
length, uttering a deep ſigh, ſhe raiſed
herſelf, and like one awakened from a
dream, gazed around her. Hippolitus
thanked God fervently in his heart.
"Tell me but that you are well," ſaid
he, "and that I may dare to hope,
and we will leave you to repoſe." "My
ſiſter," ſaid Ferdinand, "conſult only
your own wiſhes, and leave the reſt to
me. Suffer a confidence in me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate
the doubts with which you are
agitated." "Ferdinand," ſaid Julia,
emphatically, "how ſhall I expreſs
the gratitude your kindneſs has exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?"
"Your gratitude," ſaid he, "will
be beſt ſhewn in conſulting your own
wiſhes; for be aſſured, that whatever
procures you happineſs, will moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
eſtabliſh mine. Do not ſuffer
the prejudices of education to render
you miſerable. Believe that a choice
which involves the happineſs or miſery
of your whole life, ought to be decided
only by yourſelf."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0793800201:146"/>
"Let us forbear for the preſent,"
ſaid Hippolitus, "to urge the ſubject.
Repoſe is neceſſary for you," addreſſing
Julia, "and I will not ſuffer a ſelfiſh
conſideration any longer to with-hold
you from it.—Grant me but this requeſt—that
at this hour to-morrow night, I
may return hither to receive my doom."
Julia having conſented to receive Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus
and Ferdinand, they quitted the
cloſet. In turning into the grand gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
they were ſurpriſed by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a light, which gleamed upon
the wall that terminated their view. It
ſeemed to proceed from a door which
opened upon a back ſtair-caſe. They
puſhed on, but it almoſt inſtantly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and upon the ſtair-caſe all was
ſtill. They then ſeparated, and retired
to their apartments, ſomewhat alarmed
by this circumſtance, which induced
them to ſuſpect that their viſit to Julia
had been obſerved.</p>
               <p>Julia paſſed the night in broken ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0793800201:147"/>
and anxious conſideration.
On her preſent deciſion, hung the criſis
of her fate. Her conſciouſneſs of the
influence of Hippolitus over her heart,
made her fear to indulge its predilection,
by truſting to her own opinion of its fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
She ſhrunk from the diſgraceful
idea of an elopement, yet ſhe ſaw no
means of avoiding this, but by ruſhing
upon the fate ſo dreadful to her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>On the following night, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the caſtle were retired to
reſt, Hippolitus, whoſe expectation had
lengthened the hours into ages, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by Ferdinand, reviſited the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.
Julia, who had known no interval
of reſt ſince they laſt left her, received
them with much agitation. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
glow of health had fled her check,
and was ſucceeded by a languid delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
leſs beautiful, but more intereſting.
To the eager enquiries of Hippolitus,
ſhe returned no anſwer, but faintly ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0793800201:148"/>
through her tears, preſented him
her hand, and covered her face with
her robe. "I receive it," cried he,
"as the pledge of my happineſs;—yet—yet
let your voice ratify the gift."
"If the preſent conceſſion does not
ſink me in your eſteem," ſaid Julia, in a
low tone, "this hand is your's." "The
conceſſion, my love (for by that tender
name I may now call you) would, if
poſſible, raiſe you in my eſteem; but
ſince that has been long incapable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
it can only heighten my opinion
of myſelf, and increaſe my gratitude
to you: gratitude which I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſhew by an anxious care of your
happineſs, and by the tender attentions
of a whole life. From this bleſſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,"
continued he, in a voice of
rapture, "permit me, in thought, to
hail you as my wife. From this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
let me baniſh every veſtige of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row—let
me dry thoſe tears," gently
preſſing her cheek with his lips, "never
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0793800201:149"/>
to ſpring again."—The gratitude and
joy which Ferdinand expreſſed upon
this occaſion, united with the tenderneſs
of Hippolitus, to ſoothe the agitated
ſpirits of Julia, and ſhe gradually reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
her complacency.</p>
               <p>They now arranged their plan of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
in the execution of which no
time was to be loſt, ſince the nuptials
with the duke were to be ſolemnized
on the day after the morrow. Their
ſcheme, whatever it was that ſhould be
adopted, they therefore reſolved to
execute on the following night. But
when they deſcended from the firſt
warmth of enterprize, to minuter exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
they ſoon found the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the undertaking. The keys of
the caſtle were kept by Robert, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidential
ſervant of the marquis, who
every night depoſited them in an iron
cheſt in his chamber. To obtain them
by ſtratagem ſeemed impoſſible, and
Ferdinand feared to tamper with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0793800201:150"/>
of this man, who had been many
years in the ſervice of the marquis.
Dangerous as was the attempt, no
other alternative appeared, and they
were therefore compelled to reſt all
their hopes upon the experiment. It
was ſettled, that if the keys could be
procured, Ferdinand and Hippolitus
ſhould meet Julia in the cloſet. That
they ſhould convey her to the ſea ſhore,
from whence a boat, which was to be
kept in waiting, would carry them to
the oppoſite coaſt of Calabria, where the
marriage might be ſolemnized without
danger of interruption. But, as it was
neceſſary that Ferdinand ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the affair, it was agreed that he
ſhould return to the caſtle immediately,
upon the embarkation of his ſiſter.
Having thus arranged their plan of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
they ſeparated till the following
night, which was to decide the fate of
Hippolitus and Julia.</p>
               <p>Julia, whoſe mind was ſoothed by the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0793800201:151"/>
ſraternal kindneſs of Ferdinand, and the
tender aſſurances of Hippolitus, now
experienced an interval of repoſe. At
the return of day ſhe awoke refreſhed,
and tolerably compoſed. She ſelected
the few clothes which were neceſſary,
and prepared them for her journey. A
ſentiment of generoſity juſtified her in
the reſerve ſhe preſerved to Emilia and
Madame de Menon, whoſe faithfulneſs
and attachment ſhe could not doubt, but
whom ſhe diſdained to involve in the
diſgrace that muſt fall upon them,
ſhould their knowledge of her flight be
diſcovered.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the caſtle was a
ſcene of confuſion. The magnificent
preparations which were making for
the nuptials, engaged all eyes, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
all hands. The marchioneſs had
the direction of the whole, and the ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
with which ſhe acquitted herſelf,
teſtified how much ſhe was pleaſed with
the alliance, and created a ſuſpicion
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0793800201:152"/>
that it had not been concerted without
ſome exertion of her influence. Thus
was Julia deſigned the joint victim of
ambition, and illicit love.</p>
               <p>The compoſure of Julia declined
with the day, whoſe hours had crept
heavily along. As the night drew on,
her anxiety for the ſucceſs of Ferdinand's
negociation with Robert, increaſed to
a painful degree. A variety of new
emotions preſſed at her heart, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
her ſpirits. When ſhe bade Emilia
good night, ſhe thought ſhe beheld her
for the laſt time. The ideas of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which would ſeparate them, of
the dangers ſhe was going to encounter,
with a train of wild and fearful antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations,
crowded upon her mind, tears
ſprang in her eyes, and it was with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
ſhe avoided betraying her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Of Madame too, her heart took
a tender farewell. At length ſhe heard
the marquis retire to his apartment, and
the doors belonging to the ſeveral cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0793800201:153"/>
of the gueſts ſucceſſively cloſe. She
marked with trembling attention the
gradual change from buſtle to quiet,
till all was ſtill.</p>
               <p>She now held herſelf in readineſs to
depart, at the moment in which Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
and Hippolitus, for whoſe ſteps
in the gallery ſhe eagerly liſtened, ſhould
appear. The caſtle clock ſtruck twelve.
The ſound ſeemed to ſhake the pile. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
felt it thrill upon her heart. "I hear
you," ſighed ſhe "for the laſt time."
The ſtillneſs of death ſucceeded. She
continued to liſten, but no ſound met
her ear. For a conſiderable time ſhe ſat
in a ſtate of anxious expectation not to
be deſcribed. The clock chimed the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
quarters, and her fear roſe to
each additional ſound. At length ſhe
heard it ſtrike one. Hollow was that
ſound, and dreadful to her hopes, for
neither Hippolitus nor Ferdinand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
She grew faint with fear and
diſappointment. Her mind, which for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0793800201:154"/>
two hours had been kept upon the
ſtretch of expectation, now reſigned
itſelf to deſpair. She gently opened
the door of her cloſet, and looked upon
the gallery, but all was lonely and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
It appeared that Robert had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to be acceſſary to their ſcheme,
and it was probable that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
it to the marquis. Overwhelmed
with bitter reflections, ſhe threw herſelf
upon the ſopha in the firſt diſtraction
of deſpair. Suddenly ſhe thought ſhe
heard a noiſe in the gallery; and as ſhe
ſtarted from her poſture to liſten to the
ſound, the door of her cloſet was gently
opened by Ferdinand. "Come, my
love," ſaid he, "the keys are ours, and
we have not a moment to loſe; our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
has been unavoidable, but this is no
time for explanation." Julia, almoſt
fainting, gave her hand to Ferdinand;
and Hippolitus, after ſome ſhort expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his thankfulneſs, followed. They
paſſed the door of Madame's chamber;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0793800201:155"/>
and treading the gallery with ſlow and
ſilent ſteps, deſcended to the hall. This
they croſſed towards a door, after open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which they were to find their way
through various paſſages to a remote
part of the caſtle, where a private door
opened upon the walls. Ferdinand car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the ſeveral keys. They faſtened
the hall door after them, and proceeded
through a narrow paſſage terminating in
a ſtair-caſe.</p>
               <p>They deſcended, and had hardly
reached the bottom, when they heard a
loud noiſe at the door above, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
the voices of ſeveral people. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
ſcarcely felt the ground ſhe trod
on, and Ferdinand ſlew to unlock a
door that obſtructed their way. He
applied the different keys, and at length
found the proper one, but the lock
was ruſted, and refuſed to yield. Their
diſtreſs now was not to be conceived.
The noiſe above increaſed, and it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as if the people were forcing the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0793800201:156"/>
door. Hippolitus and Ferdinand vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tried to turn the key. A ſudden craſh
from above convinced them that the
door had yielded, when making another
deſperate effort, the key broke in the
lock. Trembling and exhauſted, Julia
gave herſelf up for loſt. As ſhe hung
upon Ferdinand, Hippolitus vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to ſoothe her—the noiſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ceaſed. They liſtened, dreading
to hear the ſounds renewed; but, to their
utter aſtoniſhment, the ſilence of the
place remained undiſturbed. They had
now time to breathe, and to conſider
the poſſibility of effecting their eſcape,
for from the marquis they had no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to hope. Hippolitus, in order to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
whether the people had quitted
the door above, began to aſcend the
paſſage, in which he had not gone many
ſteps, when the noiſe was renewed with
increaſed violence. He inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated;
and making a deſperate puſh
at the door below, which obſtructed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0793800201:157"/>
their paſſage, it ſeemed to yield, and by
another effort of Ferdinand, burſt open.
They had not an inſtant to loſe, for they
now heard the ſteps of perſons deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſtairs. The avenue they were
in opened into a kind of chamber,
whence three paſſages branched, of
which they immediately choſe the firſt.
Another door now obſtructed their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
and they were compelled to wait
while Ferdinand applied the keys.
"Be quick," ſaid Julia, "or we are
loſt. O! if this lock too is ruſted!"—"Hark!
ſaid Ferdinand." They now
diſcovered what apprehenſion had before
prevented them from perceiving, that
the ſounds of purſuit were ceaſed, and
all again was ſilent. As this could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
only by the miſtake of their purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in taking the wrong <hi>route,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to preſerve their advantage, by
concealing the light which Ferdinand
now covered with his cloak. The door
was opened, and they paſſed on, but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0793800201:158"/>
they were perplexed in the intricacies of
the place, and wandered about in vain
endeavour to find their way. Often did
they pauſe to liſten, and often did fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
give them ſounds of fearful import.
At length they entered on the paſſage,
which Ferdinand knew led directly to a
door that opened on the woods. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced
at this certainty, they ſoon reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſpot which was to give them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand turned the key, the door
uncloſed, and to their infinite joy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to them the grey dawn. "Now,
my love," ſaid Hippolitus, "you are
ſafe, and I am happy."—Immediately
a loud voice from without exclaimed,
"Take, villain, the reward of your
perfidy!" at the ſame inſtant Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus
received a ſword in his body,
and uttering a deep ſigh, fell to the
ground. Julia ſhrieked, and fainted.
Ferdinand, drawing his ſword, advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards the aſſaſſin, upon whoſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0793800201:159"/>
countenance the light of his lamp then
ſhone, and diſcovered to him his father!
The ſword fell from his grſap, and he
ſtarted back in an agony of horror. He
was inſtantly ſurrounded, and ſeized by
the ſervants of the marquis, while the
marquis himſelf denounced vengeance
upon his head, and ordered him to be
thrown into the dungeon of the caſtle.
At this inſtant the ſervants of the count,
who were awaiting his arrival on the ſea
ſhore, hearing the tumult, haſtened to
the ſcene, and there beheld their belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
maſter, lifeleſs and weltering in his
blood. They conveyed the bleeding bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with loud lamentations, on board the
veſſel which had been prepared for
him, and immediately ſet ſail for Italy.</p>
               <p>Julia, on recovering her ſenſes, ſound
herſelf in a ſmall room, of which ſhe
had no remembrance, with her maid
weeping over her. Recollection, when
it returned, brought to her mind an
energy of grief, which exceeded even
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0793800201:160"/>
all former conceptions of ſuffering.
Yet her miſery was heightened by the
intelligence which ſhe now received.
She learned that Hippolitus had been
borne away lifeleſs by his people, that
Ferdinand was confined in a dungeon
by order of the marquis, and that her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was a priſoner in a remote room,
from which, on the day after the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
ſhe was to be removed to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of the caſtle, and there ſacrificed to
the ambition of her father, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
love of the duke de Luovo.</p>
               <p>This accumulation of evil ſubdued
each power of reſiſtance, and reduced
Julia to a ſtate little ſhort of diſtraction.
No perſon was allowed to approach her
but her maid, and the ſervant who
brought her food. Emilia, who, though
ſhocked by Julia's apparent want of
confidence, ſeverely ſymphathized in
her diſtreſs, ſolicited to ſee her; but
the pain of denial was ſo ſharply aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by rebuke, that ſhe dared not
again to urge the requeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0793800201:161"/>
In the mean time Ferdinand, involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the gloom of a dungeon, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to the painful recollection of
the paſt, and a horrid anticipation of the
future. From the reſentment of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
whoſe paſſions were wild and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
and whoſe rank gave him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
power of life and death in his own
territories, Ferdinand had much to fear.
Yet ſelfiſh apprehenſion ſoon yielded to a
more noble ſorrow. He mourned the
fate of Hippolitus, and the ſufferings
of Julia. He could attribute the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
of their ſcheme only to the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
of Robert, who had, however,
met the wiſhes of Ferdinand, with
ſtrong apparent ſincerity, and generous
intereſt in the cauſe of Julia. On the
night of the intended elopement he
had conſigned the keys to Ferdinand,
who, immediately on receiving them,
went to the apartment of Hippolitus.
There they were detained till after
the clock had ſtruck one, by a low
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0793800201:162"/>
noiſe, which returned at intervals, and
convinced them, that ſome part of the
family was not yet retired to reſt. This
noiſe was undoubtedly occaſioned by
the people whom the marquis had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to watch, and whoſe vigilance
was too faithful to ſuffer the fugitives
to eſcape. The very caution of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
defeated its purpoſe; for it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that had he attempted to quit
the caſtle by the common entrance, he
might have eſcaped. The keys of the
grand door, and thoſe of the courts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in the poſſeſſion of Robert,
the marquis was certain of the intended
place of their departure; and was thus
enabled to defeat their hopes at the very
moment when they exulted in their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>When the marchioneſs learned the
fate of Hippolitus, the reſentment of
jealous paſſion, yielded to emotions of
pity. Revenge was ſatisfied, and ſhe
could now lament the ſufferings of a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0793800201:163"/>
youth, whoſe perſonal charms had touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her heart as much as his virtues had
diſappointed her hopes. Still true to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and inacceſſible to reaſon, ſhe poured
upon the defenceleſs Julia her anger for
that calamity of which ſhe herſelf was
the unwilling cauſe. By a dextrous adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of her powers, ſhe had worked
upon the paſſions of the marquis, ſo as
to render him relentleſs in the purſuit
of ambitious purpoſes, and inſatiable in
revenging his diſappointment. But the
effects of her artifices exceeded her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
in exerting them; and when ſhe
meant only to ſacrifice a rival to her
love, ſhe found ſhe had given up its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to revenge.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>THE nuptial morn, ſo juſtly dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Julia, and ſo impatiently
awaited by the marquis, now arrived.
The marriage was to be celebrated with
a magnificence which demonſtrated
the joy it occaſioned to the marquis.
The caſtle was fitted up in a ſtyle of
grandeur ſuperior to any thing that had
been before ſeen in it. The neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nobility were invited to an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
which was to conclude with
a ſplendid ball and ſupper, and the
gates were to be thrown open to all who
choſe to partake of the bounty of the
marquis. At an early hour the duke,
attended by a numerous retinue, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the caſtle. Ferdinand heard from
his dungeon, where the rigour and the
policy of the marquis ſtill confined him,
the loud clattering of hoofs in the
court yard above, the rolling of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0793800201:165"/>
carriage wheels, and all the tumultuous
buſtle which the entrance of the duke
occaſioned. He too well underſtood the
cauſe of this uproar, and it awakened
in him ſenſations reſembling thoſe which
the condemned criminal feels, when his
ears are aſſailed by the dreadful ſounds
that precede his execution. When he
was able to think of himſelf, he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by what means the marquis would
reconcile his abſence to the gueſts. He,
however, knew too well the diſſipated
character of the Sicilian nobility, to
doubt, that whatever ſtory ſhould be
invented would be very readily believed
by them; who, even if they knew the
truth, would not ſuffer a diſcovery of
their knowledge to interrupt the feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
which was offered them.</p>
               <p>The marquis and marchioneſs receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the duke in the outer hall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
him to the ſaloon, where he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
of the refreſhments prepared for
him, and from thence retired to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0793800201:166"/>
The marquis now withdrew to
lead Julia to the altar, and Emilia was
ordered to attend at the door of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
in which the prieſt and a numerous
company were already aſſembled. The
marchioneſs, a prey to the turbulence of
ſucceeding paſſions, exulted in the near
completion of her favourite ſcheme.
A diſappointment, however, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for her, which would at once
cruſh the triumph of her malice and
her pride. The marquis, on entering
the priſon of Julia, found it empty!
His aſtoniſhment and indignation, upon
the diſcovery, almoſt overpowered his
reaſon. Of the ſervants of the caſtle,
who were immediately ſummoned, he
enquired concerning her eſcape, with a
mixture of fury and ſorrow, which left
them no opportunity for reply. They
had, however, no information to give,
but that her woman had not appeared
during the whole morning. In the
priſon were found the bridal habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which the marchioneſs herſelf
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0793800201:167"/>
had ſent on the preceding night, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a letter addreſſed to Emilia,
which contained the following words:</p>
               <p>"Adieu, dear Emilia; never more
will you ſee your wretched ſiſter, who
flies from the cruel fate now prepared
for her, certain that ſhe can never meet
one more dreadful.—In happineſs or
miſery—in hope or deſpair—whatever
may be your ſituation—ſtill remember
me with pity and affection. Dear Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
adieu!—You will always be the
ſiſter of my heart—may you never be
the partner of my misfortunes!"</p>
               <p>While the marquis was reading this
letter, the marchioneſs, who ſuppoſed
the delay occaſioned by ſome oppoſition
from Julia, flew to the apartment. By
her orders all the habitable parts of the
caſtle were explored, and ſhe herſelf
aſſiſted in the ſearch. At length the
intelligence was communicated to the
chapel, and the confuſion became uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.
The prieſt quitted the altar,
and the company returned to the ſaloon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0793800201:168"/>
The letter, when it was given to Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
excited emotions which ſhe found
it impoſſible to diſguiſe, but which did
not, however, protect her from a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
that ſhe was concerned in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
her knowledge of which this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
appeared intended to conceal.</p>
               <p>The marquis immediately diſpatched
ſervants upon the fleeteſt horſes of his
ſtables, with directions to take different
routes, and to ſcour every corner of the
iſland in purſuit of the fugitives. When
theſe exertions had ſomewhat quieted
his mind, he began to conſider by what
means Julia could have effected her eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.
She had been confined in a ſmall
room in a remote part of the caſtle, to
which no perſon had been admitted but
her own woman, and Robert, the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
ſervant of the marquis. Even
Liſette had not been ſuffered to enter,
unleſs accompanied by Robert, in whoſe
room, ſince the night of the fatal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
the keys had been regularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited.
Without them it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0793800201:169"/>
ſhe could have eſcaped; the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of the apartment being barred
and grated, and opening into an inner
court, at a prodigious height from the
ground. Beſides, who could ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon for protection—or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could ſhe intend to fly for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment?—The
aſſociates of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
elopement were utterly unable to
aſſiſt her even with advice. Ferdinand,
himſelf a priſoner, had been deprived
of any means of intercourſe with her,
and Hippolitus had been carried life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
on board a veſſel which had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſailed for Italy.</p>
               <p>Robert, to whom the keys had been
intruſted, was ſeverely interrogated by
the marquis. He perſiſted in a ſimple
and uniform declaration of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence;
but as the marquis believed it
impoſſible that Julia could have eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without his knowledge, he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
into impriſonment till he ſhould
confeſs the fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0793800201:170"/>
The pride of the duke was ſeverely
wounded by this elopement, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the exceſs of Julia's averſion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
the diſgraceful circumſtances of
his rejection. The marquis had care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
concealed from him her prior at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
at elopement, and her conſequent
confinement; but the truth now burſt
from diſguiſe, and ſtood revealed with
bitter aggravation. The duke, fired
with indignation at the duplicity of the
marquis, powered forth his reſentment
in terms of proud and bitter invective;
and the marquis, galled by recent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
was in no mood to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
the impetuoſity of his nature.
He retorted with acrimony; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
would have been ſerious, had
not the friends of each party interpoſed
for their preſervation. The diſputants
were at length reconciled; it was agreed
to purſue Julia with united, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
ſearch; and that whenever ſhe
ſhould be found, the nuptials ſhould be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0793800201:171"/>
ſolemnized without further delay. With
the character of the duke, this conduct
was conſiſtent. His paſſions, inflamed
by diſappointment, and ſtrengthened
by repulſe, now defied the power of
obſtacle; and thoſe conſiderations which
would have operated with a more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
mind to overcome its original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
ſerved only to encreaſe the
violence of his.</p>
               <p>Madame de Menon, who loved Julia
with maternal affection, was an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
obſerver of all that paſſed at the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
The cruel fate to which the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
deſtined his daughter, ſhe had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
lamented, yet ſhe could hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
to find that this had been avoided
by elopement. She trembled for the
future ſafety of her pupil; and her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,
which was thus firſt diſturbed
for the welfare of others, ſhe was not
ſoon ſuffered to recover.</p>
               <p>The marchioneſs had long nouriſhed
ſecret diſlike to Madame de Menon,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0793800201:172"/>
whoſe virtues were a ſilent reproof to
her vices. The contrariety of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
created in the marchioneſs an
averſion which would have amounted
to contempt, had not that dignity of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which ſtrongly characterized the
manners of Madame, compelled the
former to fear what ſhe wiſhed to deſpiſe.
Her conſcience whiſpered her that the
diſlike was mutual; and ſhe now rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the opportunity which ſeemed to
offer itſelf, of lowering the proud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of Madame's character. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
therefore, to believe that ſhe
had encouraged Ferdinand to diſobey his
father's commands, and had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the elopement, ſhe accuſed
her of theſe offences, and ſtimulated the
marquis to reprehend her conduct. But
the integrity of Madame de Menon was
not to be queſtioned with impunity.
Without deigning to anſwer the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
ſhe deſired to reſign an office of
which ſhe was no longer conſidered wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0793800201:173"/>
and to quit the caſtle immediately.
This the policy of the marquis would not
ſuffer; and he was compelled to make
ſuch ample conceſſions to Madame, as
induced her for the preſent to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
at the caſtle.</p>
               <p>The news of Julia's elopement at
length reached the ears of Ferdinand,
whoſe joy at this event was equalled
only by his ſurprize. He loſt, for a
moment, the ſenſe of his own ſituation,
and thought only of the eſcape of Julia.
But his ſorrow ſoon returned with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated
force when he recollected
that Julia might then perhaps want that
aſſiſtance, which his confinement alone
could prevent his affording her.</p>
               <p>The ſervants, who had been ſent in
purſuit, returned to the caſtle without
any ſatisfactory information. Week
after week elapſed in fruitleſs ſearch,
yet the duke was ſtrenuous in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the purſuit. Emiſſaries were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
to Naples, and to the ſeveral
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0793800201:174"/>
eſtates of the count Vereza, but they
returned without any ſatisfactory infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
The count had not been heard
of ſince he quitted Naples for Sicily.</p>
               <p>During theſe enquiries a new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of diſturbance broke out in the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Mazzini. On the night ſo fatal
to the hopes of Hippolitus and Julia,
when the tumult was ſubſided, and all
was ſtill, a light was obſerved by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
as he paſſed by the window of the
great ſtair-caſe in the way to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to glimmer through the caſement
before noticed in the ſouthern build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
While he ſtood obſerving it, it
vaniſhed, and preſently re-appeared.
The former myſterious circumſtances
relative to theſe buildings ruſhed upon
his mind; and fired with wonder, he
rouſed ſome of his fellow ſervants to
come and behold this phenomenon.</p>
               <p>As they gazed in ſilent terror, the
light diſappeared, and ſoon after, they
ſaw a ſmall door belonging to the ſouth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0793800201:175"/>
tower open, and a figure bearing a light
iſſue forth, which gliding along the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
walls, was quickly loſt to their view.
Overcome with fear, they hurried back
to their chambers, and revolved all the
late wonderful occurrences. They doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not, that this was the figure formerly
ſeen by the lady Julia. The ſudden
change of Madame de Menon's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had not paſſed unobſerved by the
ſervants, but they now no longer heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to what to attribute the removal. They
collected each various and uncommon
circumſtance attendant on this part of
the fabric; and, comparing them with
the preſent, their ſuperſtitious fears were
confirmed, and their terror heightened
to ſuch a degree, that many of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to quit the ſervice of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis.</p>
               <p>The marquis ſurprized at this ſudden
deſertion, enquired into its cauſe, and
learned the truth. Shocked by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
he yet reſolved to prevent, if
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0793800201:176"/>
poſſible, the ill effects which might be
expected from a circulation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
To this end it was neceſſary to
quiet the minds of his people, and to
prevent their quitting his ſervice. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeverely reprehended them for the
idle apprehenſion they encouraged, he
told them that, to prove the fallacy of
their ſurmiſes, he would lead them over
that part of the caſtle which was the
ſubject of their fears, and ordered them
to attend him at the return of night in
the north hall. Emilia and Madame de
Menon ſurprized at this procedure,
awaited the iſſue in ſilent expectation.</p>
               <p>The ſervants in obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the marquis, aſſembled at
night in the north hall. The air of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
which reigned through the
ſouth buildings; and the circumſtance
of their having been for ſo many years
ſhut up, would naturally tend to inſpire
awe; but to theſe people, who firmly
believed them to be the haunt of an
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0793800201:177"/>
unquiet ſpirit, terror was the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
ſentiment.</p>
               <p>The marquis now appeared with the
keys of theſe buildings in his hands, and
every heart thrilled with wild expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He ordered Robert to precede him
with a torch, and the reſt of the ſervants
following, he paſſed on. A pair of iron
gates were unlocked, and they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through a court, whoſe pavement was
wildly overgrown with long graſs, to
the great door of the ſouth fabric. Here
they met with ſome difficulty, for the
lock, which had not been turned for
many years, was ruſted.</p>
               <p>During this interval, the ſilence of
expectation ſealed the lips of all preſent.
At length the lock yielded. That door
which had not been paſſed for ſo many
years, creaked heavily upon its hinges,
and diſcloſed the hall of black marble
which Ferdinand had formerly croſſed.
"Now," cried the marquis, in a tone
of irony as he entered, "expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0793800201:178"/>
counter the ghoſts of which you tell
me; but if you fail to conquer them,
prepare to quit my ſervice. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who live with me, ſhall at leaſt have
courage and ability ſufficient to defend
me from theſe ſpiritual attacks. All I
apprehend is, that the enemy will not
appear, and in this caſe your valour will
go untried."</p>
               <p>No one dared to anſwer, but all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
in ſilent fear, the marquis, who
aſcended the great ſtair-caſe, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the gallery. "Unlock that door,"
ſaid he, pointing to one on the left,
"and we will ſoon unhouſe theſe
ghoſts." Robert applied the key, but
his hand ſhook ſo violently that he
could not turn it. "Here is a fellow,"
cried the marquis, "fit to encounter
a whole legion of ſpirits. Do you,
Anthony, take the key, and try your
valour."</p>
               <p>"Pleaſe you, my lord," replied
Anthony, "I never was a good one at
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0793800201:179"/>
unlocking a door in my life, but here
is Gregory will do it." "No, my
lord, an' pleaſe you," ſaid Gregory,
here is Richard." "Stand off" ſaid
the marquis, "I will ſhame your cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice,
and do it myſelf."</p>
               <p>Saying this he turned the key, and
was ruſhing on, but the door refuſed to
yield; it ſhook under his hands, and
ſeemed as if partially held by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
on the other ſide. The marquis was
ſurprized, and made ſeveral efforts to
move it, without effect. He then order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his ſervants to burſt it open, but,
ſhrinking back with one accord, they
crid "for God's ſake, my lord, go no
farther; we are ſatisfied here are no
ghoſts, only let us get back."</p>
               <p>"It is now then my turn to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,"
replied the marquis, "and till I
am, not one of you ſhall ſtir. Open
me that door." "My lord!"—"Nay,"
ſaid the marquis, aſſuming a look of
ſtern authority—"diſpute not my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
I am not to be trifled with."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0793800201:180"/>
They now ſtepped forward, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
their ſtrength to the door, when a
loud and ſudden noiſe burſt from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and reſounded through the hollow
chambers! The men ſtarted back in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright,
and were ruſhing headlong down
the ſtair-caſe, when the voice of the
marquis arreſted their flight. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with hearts palpitating with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
"Obſerve what I ſay," ſaid the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
"and behave like men. Yonder
door," pointing to one at ſome diſtance,
"will lead us through other rooms to
this chamber—unlock it therefore, for
I will know the cauſe of theſe founds."
Shocked at this determination, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
again ſupplicated the marquis to
go no farther; and to be obeyed, he
was obliged to exert all his authority.
The door was opened, and diſcovered a
long narrow paſſage, into which they
deſcended by a few ſteps. It led to a
gallery that terminated in a back ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0793800201:181"/>
where ſeveral doors appeared, one
of which the marquis uncloſed. A ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
chamber appeared beyond, whoſe
walls, decayed and diſcoloured by the
damps, exhibited a melancholy proof
of deſertion.</p>
               <p>They paſſed on through a long ſuite
of lofty and noble apartments, which
were in the ſame ruinous condition.
At length they came to the chamber
whence the noiſe had iſſued. "Go
firſt Robert, with the light," ſaid the
marquis, as they approached the door,
"this is the key." Robert trembled—but
obeyed, and the other ſervants
followed in ſilence. They ſtopped a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the door to liſten, but all was
ſtill within. The door was opened, and
diſcloſed a large vaulted chamber, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſembling thoſe they had paſſed,
and on looking round, they diſcovered
at once the cauſe of the alarm.—A part
of the decayed roof was fallen in, and
the ſtones and rubbiſh of the ruin fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0793800201:182"/>
againſt the gallery door, obſtructed
the paſſage. It was evident, too, whence
the noiſe which occaſioned their terror
had ariſen; the looſe ſtones which were
piled againſt the door being ſhook by
the effort made to open it, had given
way, and rolled to the floor.</p>
               <p>After ſurveying the place, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the back ſtairs, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,
and having purſued the ſeveral
windings of a long paſſage, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
again in the marble hall. "Now,"
ſaid the marquis, "what think ye?—What
evil ſpirits infeſt theſe walls?
Henceforth be cautions how ye credit
the phantaſms of idleneſs, for ye may
not always meet with a maſter who
will condeſcend to undeceive ye." They
acknowledged the goodneſs of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
and profeſſing themſelves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
conſcious of the error of their
former ſuſpicions, deſired they might
ſearch no farther. "I chuſe to leave
nothing to your imagination," replied
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0793800201:183"/>
the marquis, leſt hereafter it ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
you into a ſimilar error. Follow
me, therefore; you ſhall ſee the whole
of theſe buildings." Saying this he
led them to the ſouth tower. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered,
that from a door of this
tower, the figure which cauſed their
alarm had iſſued; and notwithſtanding
the late aſſertion of their ſuſpicions
being removed, fear ſtill operated pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
upon their minds, and they
would willingly have been excuſed
from farther reſearch. "Would any
of you chuſe to explore this tower?"
ſaid the marquis, pointing to the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſtair-caſe; "for myſelf I am mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and therefore fear to venture, but
you who hold communion with diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied
ſpirits, may partake ſomething
of their nature, if ſo, you may paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
apprehenſion where the ghoſt has
probably paſſed before." They ſhrunk
at this reproof, and were ſilent.</p>
               <p>The marquis, turning to a door on
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0793800201:184"/>
his right hand, ordered it to be unlock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It opened upon the country, and
the ſervants knew it to be the ſame
whence the figure had appeared. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
re-locked it, "Lift that trap-door,
we will deſcend into the vaults," ſaid
the marquis. "What trap-door, my
lord?" ſaid Robert, with encreaſed agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
"I ſee none." The marquis point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Robert perceived a door which
lay almoſt concealed beneath the ſtones
that had fallen from the ſtair-caſe above.
He began to remove them, when the
marquis ſuddenly turning, "I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſufficiently indulged your folly,"
ſaid he, "and am weary of this buſineſs.
If you are capable of receiving convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from truth, you muſt now be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that theſe buildings are not the
haunt of a ſuper-natural being; and if
you are incapable, it would be entirely
uſeleſs to proceed. You, Robert, may
therefore ſpare yourſelf the trouble of
removing the rubbiſh; we will quit this
part of the fabric."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0793800201:185"/>
The ſervants joyfully obeyed, and the
marquis locking the ſeveral doors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with the keys to the habitable
part of the caſtle.</p>
               <p>Every enquiry after Julia had hitherto
proved fruitleſs, and the imperious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the marquis, heightened by the
preſent vexation, became intolerably
oppreſſive to all around him. As the
hope of recovering Julia declined, his
opinion that Emilia had aſſiſted her to
eſcape ſtrengthened, and he inflicted
upon her the ſeverity of his unjuſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions.
She was ordered to confine
herſelf to her apartment till her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
ſhould be cleared, or her ſiſter
diſcovered. From Madame de Menon
ſhe received a faithful ſympathy, which
was the ſole relief of her oppreſſed
heart. Her anxiety concerning Julia
daily encreaſed, and was heightened
into the moſt terrifying apprehenſions
for her ſafety. She knew of no perſon
in whom her ſiſter could confide, or of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0793800201:186"/>
any place where ſhe could find protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the moſt deplorable evils were
therefore to be expected.</p>
               <p>One day as ſhe was ſitting at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of her apartment, engaged in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
reflection, ſhe ſaw a man ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
towards the caſtle on full ſpeed.
Her heart beat with fear and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for his haſte made her ſuſpect he
brought intelligence of Julia, and ſhe
could ſcarcely refrain from breaking
through the command of the marquis,
and ruſhing into the hall to learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his errand. She was right in
her conjecture; the perſon ſhe had ſeen
was a ſpy of the marquis's, and came to
inform him that the lady Julia was at that
time concealed in a cottage of the foreſt
of Marentino. The marquis rejoiced
at this intelligence, and gave the man a
liberal reward. He learned alſo, that
ſhe was accompanied by a young cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
which circumſtance ſurprized him
exceedingly, for he knew of no perſon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0793800201:187"/>
except the count de Vereza with whom
ſhe could have entruſted herſelf, and
the count had fallen by his ſword! He
immediately ordered a party of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to accompany the meſſenger to the
foreſt of Marentino, and to ſuffer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Julia nor the cavalier to eſcape
them on pain of death.</p>
               <p>When the duke de Luovo was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of this diſcovery, he entreated
and obtained permiſſion of the marquis
to join in the purſuit. He immediately
ſet out on the expedition, armed, and
followed by a number of his ſervants.
He reſolved to encounter all hazards,
and to practiſe the moſt deſperate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
rather than fail in the object of
his enterprize. In a ſhort time he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the marquis's people, and they
proceeded together with all poſſible
ſpeed. The foreſt lay ſeveral leagues
diſtant from the caſtle of Mazzini, and
the day was cloſing when they entered
upon the borders. The thick foliage
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0793800201:188"/>
of the trees ſpread a deeper ſhade
around, and they were obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with caution. Darkneſs had long
fallen upon the earth when they reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the cottage, to which they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by a light that glimmered from
afar among the trees. The duke left
his people at ſome diſtance; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting,
and accompanied only by
one ſervant, approached the cottage.
When he reached it he ſtopped, and
looking through the window obſerved a
man and woman in the habit of peaſants
ſeated at their ſupper. They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with earneſtneſs, and the duke,
hoping to obtain farther intelligence of
Julia, endeavoured to liſten to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
They were praiſing the beauty
of a lady whom the duke did not doubt
to be Julia, and the woman ſpoke much
in praiſe of the cavalier. "He has a
noble heart," ſaid ſhe, "and I am ſure
by his look belongs to ſome great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily."
"Nay," replied her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0793800201:189"/>
"the lady is as good as he. I
have been at Palermo, and ought to
know what great folks are, and if ſhe is
not one of them, never take my word
again. Poor thing, how ſhe does take
on! It made my heart ach to ſee her."</p>
               <p>They were ſome time ſilent. The
duke knocked at the door, and enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the man who opened it concerning
the lady and cavalier then in his cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
He was aſſured there were no
other perſons in the cottage than thoſe
he then ſaw. The duke perſiſted in
affirming that the perſons he enquired
for were there concealed, which the
man being as reſolute in denying, he
gave the ſignal, and his people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
and ſurrounded the cottage.
The peaſants, terrified by this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
confeſſed that a lady and cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
ſuch as the duke deſcribed, had
been for ſome time concealed in the
cottage, but that they were now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0793800201:190"/>
Suſpicious of the truth of the latter
aſſertion, the duke ordered his people
to ſearch the cottage, and that part of
the foreſt contiguous to it. The ſearch
ended in diſappointment. The duke,
however, reſolved to obtain all poſſible
information concerning the fugitives;
and aſſuming, therefore, a ſtern air,
bade the peaſant, on pain of inſtant
death, diſcover all he knew of them.</p>
               <p>The man replied, that on a very dark
and ſtormy night, about a week before,
two perſons had come to the cottage,
and deſired ſhelter. That they were
unattended, but ſeemed to be perſons
of conſequence in diſguiſe. That they
paid very liberally for what they had,
and that they departed from the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
a few hours before the arrival of
the duke.</p>
               <p>The duke enquired concerning the
courſe they had taken, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
information, re-mounted his
horſe, and ſet forward in purſuit. The
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0793800201:191"/>
road lay for ſeveral leagues through the
foreſt, and the darkneſs, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of encountering banditti, made
the journey dangerous. About the
break of day, they quitted the foreſt,
and entered upon a wild and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
country, in which they travelled
ſome miles without perceiving a hut,
or a human being. No veſtige of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation
appeared, and no ſounds reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them but thoſe of their horſes feet,
and the roaring of the winds through
the deep foreſts that overhung the
mountains. The purſuit was uncertain,
but the duke reſolved to perſevere.</p>
               <p>They came at length to a cottage,
where he repeated his enquiries, and
learned to his ſatisfaction that two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſuch as he deſcribed, had ſtopped
there for refreſhment about two hours
before. He found it now neceſſary to
ſtop for the ſame purpoſe. Bread and
milk, the only proviſions of the place,
were ſet before him, and his attendants
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0793800201:192"/>
would have been well contented, had
there been ſufficient of this homely fare
to have ſatisfied their hunger.</p>
               <p>Having diſpatched an haſty meal,
they again ſet forward in the way
pointed out to them as the route of the
fugitives. The country aſſumed a more
civilized aſpect. Corn, vineyards, olives,
and groves of mulberry trees adorned
the hills. The vallies, luxuriant in
ſhade, were frequently embelliſhed by
the windings of a lucid ſtream, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified
by cluſters of half-ſeen cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Here the riſing turrets of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
appeared above the thick trees
with which they were ſurrounded; and
there the ſavage wilds, the travellers
had paſſed, formed a bold and pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque
back-ground to the ſcene.</p>
               <p>To the queſtions put by the duke to
the ſeveral perſons he met, he received
anſwers that encouraged him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
At noon he halted at a village to
refreſh himſelf and his people. He
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0793800201:193"/>
could gain no intelligence of Julia, and
was perplexed which way to chuſe;
but determined at length to purſue the
road he was then in, and accordingly
again ſet forward. He travelled ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
miles without meeting any perſon
who could give the neceſſary informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and began to deſpair of ſucceſs.
The lengthened ſhadows of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and the fading light gave ſignals of
declining day; when having gained the
ſummit of a high hill, he obſerved two
perſons travelling on horſe-back in the
plains below. On one of them he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
the habiliments of a woman;
and in her air he thought he diſcovered
that of Julia. While he ſtood atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
ſurveying them, they looked tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
the hill, when, as if urged by a
ſudden impulſe of terror, they ſet off on
full ſpeed over the plains. The duke
had no doubt that theſe were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
he ſought; and he, therefore, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
ſome of his people to purſue
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0793800201:194"/>
them, and puſhed his horſe into a full
gallop. Before he reached the plains,
the fugitives, winding round an abrupt
hill, were loſt to his view. The duke
continued his courſe, and his people,
who were a conſiderable way before him,
at length reached the hill, behind which
the two perſons had diſappeared. No
traces of them were to be ſeen, and they
entered a narrow defile between two
ranges of high, and ſavage mountains;
on the right of which a rapid ſtream
rolled along, and broke with its deep
reſounding murmurs the ſolemn ſilence
of the place. The ſhades of evening
now fell thick, and the ſcene was ſoon
enveloped in darkneſs; but to the duke,
who was animated by a ſtrong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
paſſion, theſe were unimport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
circumſtances. Although he knew
that the wilds of Sicily were frequently
infeſted with banditti, his numbers
made him fearleſs of attack. Not ſo
his attendants, many of whom, as the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0793800201:195"/>
darkneſs increaſed, teſtified emotions
not very honourable to their courage;
ſtarting at every buſh, and believing it
concealed a murderer. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to diſſuade the duke from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
expreſſing uncertainty of their
being in the right route, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the open plains. But the duke,
whoſe eye had been vigilant to mark
the flight of the fugitives, and who
was not to be diſſuaded from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
quickly repreſſed their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
They continued their courſe
without meeting a ſingle perſon.</p>
               <p>The moon now roſe, and afforded
them a ſhadowy imperfect view of the
ſurrounding objects. The proſpect was
gloomy and vaſt, and not a human ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
met their eyes. They had now
loſt every trace of the ſugitives, and
found themſelves bewildered in a wild
and ſavage country. Their only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
care was to extricate themſelves
from ſo forlorn a ſituation, and they liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0793800201:196"/>
at every ſtep with anxious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for ſome ſound that might diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to them the haunts of men. They
liſtened in vain; the ſtillneſs of night
was undiſturbed but by the wind, which
broke at intervals in low and hollow
murmers from among the mountains.</p>
               <p>As they proceeded with ſilent caution,
they perceived a light break from among
the rocks at ſome diſtance. The duke
heſitated whether to approach, ſince it
might probably proceed from a party
of the banditti with which theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were ſaid to be infeſted. While
he heſitated, it diſappeared; but he had
not advanced many ſteps when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.
He now perceived it iſſue from
the mouth of a cavern, and caſt a bright
reflection upon the overhanging rocks
and ſhrubs.</p>
               <p>He diſmounted, and followed by two
of his people, leaving the reſt at ſome
diſtance, moved with ſlow and ſilent
ſteps towards the cave. As he drew
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0793800201:197"/>
near he heard the ſound of many voices
in high carouſal. Suddenly the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar
ceaſed, and the following words
were ſung by a clear and manly voice:</p>
               <lg>
                  <head>SONG.</head>
                  <lg>

                     <l>And chace the forms of future ill!</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Quick the magic raptures ſteal</l>
                     <l>O'er the fancy kindling brain;</l>
                     <l>Warm the heart with ſocial zeal,</l>
                     <l>And ſong and laughter reign.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Then viſions of pleaſure ſhall float on our ſight,</l>
                     <l>While light bounding our ſpirits ſhall flow;</l>
                     <l>And the god ſhall impart a fine ſenſe of delight</l>
                     <l>Which in vain <hi>ſober</hi> mortals would know.</l>
                  </lg>
               </lg>
               <p>The laſt verſe was repeated in loud
chorus. The duke liſtened with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment!
Such ſocial merriment, amid
a ſcene of ſuch ſavage wildneſs, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more like enchantment than reality.
He would not have heſitated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
this a party of banditti, had not
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0793800201:198"/>
the delicacy of expreſſion preſerved in
the ſong, appeared unattainable by men
of their claſs.</p>
               <p>He had now a full view of the cave,
and the moment which convinced him
of his error, ſerved alſo to encreaſe his
ſurprize. He beheld by the light of a
fire, a party of banditti ſeated within
the deepeſt receſs of the cave, round a
rude kind of table formed in the rock.
The table was ſpread with proviſions,
and they were regaling themſelves with
great eagerneſs and joy. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
of the men exhibited a ſtrange
mixture of fierceneſs and ſociality; and
the duke could almoſt have imagined
he beheld in theſe robbers a band of
the early Romans before knowledge had
civilized, or luxury had ſoftened them.
But he had not much time for medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—a
ſenſe of his danger bade him fly,
while to fly was yet in his power.</p>
               <p>As he turned to depart, he obſerved
two ſaddle horſes grazing upon the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0793800201:199"/>
near the mouth of the cave. It
inſtantly occurred to him that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to Julia, and her companion.
He heſitated, and at length determined
to linger awhile, and liſten to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of the robbers, hoping from
thence to have his doubts reſolved.
They talked for ſome time in a ſtrain
of high conviviality, and recounted in
exultation many of their exploits. They
deſcribed alſo the behaviour of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
people whom they had robbed, with
highly ludicrous alluſions, and with
much rude humour; while the cave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echoed
with loud burſts of laughter
and applauſe. They were thus engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in tumultuous merriment, till one of
them curſing the ſcanty plunder of their
late adventure, but praiſing the beauty
of a lady, they all lowered their voices
together, and ſeemed as if debating
upon a point uncommonly intereſting
to them. The paſſions of the duke were
rouſed, and he became certain that it
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0793800201:200"/>
was Julia of whom they had ſpoken.
In the firſt impuſe of feeling, he drew
his ſword; but recollecting the number
of his adverſaries, reſtrained his fury.
He was turning from the cave, with a
deſign of ſummoning his people, when
the light of the fire glittering upon the
bright blade of his weapon, caught the
eye of one of the banditti. He ſtarted
from his ſeat, and his comrades inſtantly
riſing in conſternation, diſcovered the
duke. They ruſhed with loud vocife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
towards the mouth of the cave.
He endeavoured to eſcape to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
but two of the banditti mounting
the horſes which were grazing near,
quickly overtook and ſeized him. His
dreſs and air proclaimed him to be a
perſon of diſtinction, and rejoicing in
their proſpect of plunder, they forced
him towards the cave. Here their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades
awaited them, but what were the
emotions of the duke, when he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the perſon of the principal rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0793800201:201"/>
his own ſon! who, to eſcape the
galling ſeverity of his father, had fled
from his caſtle ſome years before, and
had not been heard of ſince.</p>
               <p>He had placed himſelf at the head of
a party of banditti, and pleaſed with
the liberty which till then he had never
taſted, and with the power which his
new ſituation afforded him, he became
ſo much attached to this wild and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
mode of life, that he determined
never to quit it till death ſhould diſſolve
thoſe ties which now made his rank only
oppreſſive. This event ſeemed at ſo
great a diſtance, that he ſeldom allowed
himſelf to think of it. Whenever it
ſhould happen, he had no doubt that he
might either reſume his rank without
danger of diſcovery, or might juſtify
his preſent conduct as a frolick which a
few acts of generoſity would eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.
He knew his power would then
place him beyond the reach of cenſure,
in a country where the people are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0793800201:202"/>
to implicit ſubordination, and
ſeldom dare to ſerutinize the actions of
the nobility.</p>
               <p>His ſenſations, however, on diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his father, were not very pleaſing;
but proclaiming the duke, he protected
him from farther outrage.</p>
               <p>With the duke, whoſe heart was a
ſtranger to the ſofter affections, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
uſurped the place of parental feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
His pride was the only paſſion
affected by the diſcovery; and he had
the raſhneſs to expreſs the indignation,
which the conduct of his ſon had exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in terms of unreſtrained invective.
The banditti, inflamed by the oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium
with which he loaded their order,
threatened inſtant puniſhment to his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity;
and the authority of Riccardo
could hardly reſtrain them within the
limits of forbearance.</p>
               <p>The menaces, and at length entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
of the duke, to prevail with his ſon
to abandon his preſent way of life, were
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0793800201:203"/>
equally ineffectual. Secure in his own
power, Riccardo laughed at the firſt,
and was inſenſible to the latter; and his
father was compelled to relinquiſh the
attempt. The duke, however, boldly
and paſſionately accuſed him of having
plundered and ſecreted a lady and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,
his friends, at the ſame time deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
Julia, for whoſe liberation he
offered large rewards. Riccardo deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the fact, which ſo much exaſperated
the duke, that he drew his ſword with
an intention of plunging it in the breaſt
of his ſon. His arm was arreſted by
the ſurrounding banditti, who half un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathed
their ſwords, and ſtood ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in an attitude of menace. The
fate of the father now hung upon the
voice of the ſon. Riccardo raiſed his
arm, but inſtantly dropped it, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away. The banditti ſheathed their
weapons, and ſtepped back.</p>
               <p>Riccardo ſolemnly ſwearing that he
knew nothing of the perſons deſcribed,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0793800201:204"/>
the duke at length became convinced
of the truth of the aſſertion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from the cave, rejoined his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
All the impetuous paſſions of his
nature were rouſed and inflamed by the
diſcovery of his ſon, in a ſituation ſo
wretchedly diſgraceful. Yet it was his
pride rather than his virtue that was
hurt; and when he wiſhed him dead, it
was rather to ſave himſelf from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
than his ſon from the real indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of vice. He had no means of
reclaiming him; to have attempted
it by force, would have been at this
time the exceſs of temerity, for his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
though numerous, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined,
and would have fallen cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
victims to the power of a ſavage
and dexterous banditti.</p>
               <p>With thoughts agitated in fierce and
agonizing conflict, he purſued his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and having loſt all trace of Julia,
ſought only for an habitation which
might ſhelter him from the night, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0793800201:205"/>
afford neceſſary refreſhment for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his people. With this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
there appeared little hope of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>THE night grew ſtormy. The hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
winds ſwept over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and blew bleak and cold around;
the clouds were driven ſwiftly over the
face of the moon, and the duke and his
people were frequently involved in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
darkneſs. They had travelled on
ſilently and dejectedly for ſome hours,
and were bewildered in the wilds, when
they ſuddenly heard the bell of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
chiming for midnight prayer.
Their hearts revived at the ſound, which
they endeavoured to follow, but they
had not gone far, when the gale wafted
it away, and they were abandoned to the
uncertain guide of their own conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>They had purſued for ſome time the
way which they judged led to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
when the note of the bell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
upon the wind, and diſcovered
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0793800201:207"/>
to them that they had miſtaken their
route. After much wandering and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
they arrived, overcome with
wearineſs, at the gates of a large and
gloomy fabric. The bell had ceaſed,
and all was ſtill. By the moon-light,
which through broken clouds now
ſtreamed upon the building, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
convinced it was the monaſtery
they had ſought, and the duke himſelf
ſtruck loudly upon the gate.</p>
               <p>Several minutes elapſed, no perſon
appeared, and he repeated the ſtroke.
A ſtep was preſently heard within, the
gate was unbarred, and a thin ſhivering
figure preſented itſelf. The duke ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
admiſſion, but was refuſed, and
reprimanded for diſturbing the convent
at the hour ſacred to prayer. He
then made known his rank, and bade
the friar inform the Superior that he
requeſted ſhelter from the night. The
friar, ſuſpicious of deceit, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of robbers, refuſed with much
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0793800201:208"/>
firmneſs, and repeated that the convent
was engaged in prayer; he had almoſt
cloſed the gate, when the duke, whom
hunger and fatigue made deſperate,
ruſhed by him, and paſſed into the court.
It was his intention to preſent himſelf
to the Superior, and he had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
far when the ſound of laughter,
and of many voices in loud and mirth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
jollity, attracted his ſteps. It led
him through ſeveral paſſages to a door,
through the crevices of which light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
He pauſed a moment, and
heard within a wild uproar of merriment
and ſong. He was ſtruck with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
and could ſcarcely credit his
ſenſes!</p>
               <p>He uncloſed the door, and beheld in
a large room, well lighted, a company
of friars, dreſt in the habit of their
order, placed round a table, which was
profuſely ſpread with wines and fruits.
The Superior, whoſe habit diſtinguiſhed
him from his aſſociates, appeared at the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0793800201:209"/>
head of the table. He was lifting a
large goblet of wine to his lips, and was
roaring out, "Profuſion and confuſion,"
at the moment when the duke entered.
His appearance cauſed a general alarm;
that part of the company who were not
too much intoxicated, aroſe from their
ſeats; and the Superior, dropping the
goblet from his hands, endeavoured to
aſſume a look of auſterity, which his
roſy countenance belied. The duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a reprimand, delivered in the
liſping accents of intoxication, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed
with frequent interjections of
hiccup. He made known his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
his diſtreſs, and ſolicited a night's
lodging for himſelf and his people.
When the Superior underſtood the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
of his gueſt, his features relaxed
into a ſmile of joyous welcome; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by the hand, he placed him
by his ſide.</p>
               <p>The table was quickly covered with
luxurious proviſions, and orders were
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0793800201:210"/>
given that the duke's people ſhould be
admitted, and taken care of. He was
regaled with a variety of the fineſt wines,
and at length, highly elevated by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtic
hoſpitality, he retired to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
allotted him, leaving the Superior
in a condition which precluded all cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>He departed in the morning, very
well pleaſed with the accommodating
principles of monaſtic religion. He
had been told that the enjoyment of the
good things of this life was the ſureſt
ſign of our gratitude to Heaven; and
it appeared, that within the walls of a
Sicilian monaſtery, the precept and the
practice were equally enforced.</p>
               <p>He was now at a loſs what courſe to
chuſe, for he had no clue to direct him
towards the object of his purſuit; but
hope ſtill invigorated, and urged him
to perſeverance. He was not many
leagues from the coaſt; and it occurred
to him, that the fugitives might make
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0793800201:211"/>
towards it with a deſign of eſcaping
into Italy. He therefore determined to
travel towards the ſea, and proceed along
the ſhore.</p>
               <p>At the houſe where he ſtopped to
dine, he learned that two perſons, ſuch
he deſcribed, had halted there about an
hour before his arrival, and had ſet off
again in much ſeeming haſte. They
had taken the road towards the coaſt,
whence it was obvious to the duke they
deſigned to embark. He ſtayed not to
finiſh the repaſt ſet before him, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
re-mounted to continue the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</p>
               <p>To the enquiries he made of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
he chanced to meet, favourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
were returned for a time, but he
was at length bewildered in uncertainty,
and travelled for ſome hours in a direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which chance, rather than judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
prompted him to take.</p>
               <p>The falling evening again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
his proſpects, and unſettled his
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0793800201:212"/>
hopes. The ſhades were deepened by
thick and heavy clouds that enveloped
the horizon, and the deep ſounding air
foretold a tempeſt. The thunder now
rolled at a diſtance, and the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
clouds grew darker. The duke
and his people were on a wild and
dreary heath, round which they looked
in vain for ſhelter, the view being termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
on all ſides by the ſame deſolate
ſcene. They rode, however, as hard
as their horſes would carry them; and
at length one of the attendants eſpied
on the ſkirts of the waſte a large man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
towards which they immediately
directed their courſe.</p>
               <p>They were overtaken by the ſtorm,
and at the moment when they reached
the building, a peal of thunder, which
ſeemed to ſhake the pile, burſt over
their heads. They now found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a large and ancient manſion,
which ſeemed totally deſerted, and
was falling to decay. The edifice was
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0793800201:213"/>
diſtinguiſhed by an air of magnificence,
which ill accorded with the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſcenery, and which excited ſome
degree of ſurprize in the mind of the
duke, who, however fully juſtified the
owner in forſaking a ſpot, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the eye only views of rude
and deſolated nature.</p>
               <p>The ſtorm encreaſed with much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and threatened to detain the duke
a priſoner in his preſent habitation for
the night. The hall, of which he and
his people had taken poſſeſſion, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
in every feature marks of ruin and
deſolation. The marble pavement was
in many places broken, the walls were
mouldering in decay, and round the
high and ſhattered windows the long
graſs waved to the lonely gale. Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
led him to explore the receſſes of
the manſion. He quitted the hall, and
entered upon a paſſage which conducted
him to a remote part of the edifice. He
wandered through the wild and ſpacious
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0793800201:214"/>
apartments in gloomy meditation, and
often pauſed in wonder at the remains
of magnificence which he beheld.</p>
               <p>The manſion was irregular and vaſt,
and he was bewildered in its intricacies.
In endeavouring to find his way back,
he only perplexed himſelf more, till at
length he arrived at a door, which he
believed led into the hall he firſt quitted.
On opening it, he diſcovered by the
faint light of the moon, a large place,
which he ſcarcely knew whether to
think a cloiſter, a chapel, or a hall.
It retired in long perſpective, in arches,
and terminated in a large iron gate,
through which appeared the open coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>The lightenings flaſhed thick and
blue around, which together with the
thunder, that ſeemed to rend the wide
arch of Heaven, and the melancholy
aſpect of the place, ſo awed the duke,
that he involuntarily called to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
His voice was anſwered only
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0793800201:215"/>
by the deep echoes which ran in
murmurs through the place, and died
away at diſtance; and the moon now
ſinking behind a cloud, left him in total
darkneſs.</p>
               <p>He repeated the call more loudly,
and at length heard the approach of
footſteps. A few moments relieved
him from his anxiety, for his people
appeared. The ſtorm was yet loud, and
the heavy and ſulphureous appearance
of the atmoſphere promiſed no ſpeedy
abatement of it. The duke endeavoured
to reconcile himſelf to paſs the night in
his preſent ſituation, and ordered a fire
to be lighted in the place he was in.
This with much difficulty was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.
He then threw himſelf on the
pavement before it, and tried to endure
the abſtinence which he had ſo ill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the monaſtery on the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
night. But to his great joy his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
more provident than himſelf,
had not ſcrupled to accept a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0793800201:216"/>
quantity of proviſions which had
been offered them at the monaſtery;
and which they now drew forth from a
wallet. They were ſpread upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the duke, after refreſhing
himſelf, delivered up the remains to his
people. Having ordered them to watch
by turns at the gate, he wrapt his cloak
round him, and reſigned himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>The night paſſed without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance.
The morning aroſe freſh
and bright; the Heavens exhibited a
clear and unclouded concave; even the
wild heath, refreſhed by the late rains,
ſmiled around, and ſent up with the
morning gale a ſtream of fragrance.</p>
               <p>The duke quitted the manſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated
by the cheerfulneſs of morn,
and purſued his journey. He could
gain no intelligence of the fugitives.
About noon he found himſelf in a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
romantic country; and having
reached the ſummit of ſome wild cliffs,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0793800201:217"/>
he reſted to view the pictureſque ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
of the ſcene below. A ſhadowy
ſequeſtered dell appeared buried deep
among the rocks, and in the bottom was
ſeen a lake, whoſe clear boſom reflected
the impending cliffs, and the beautiful
luxuriance of the overhanging ſhades.</p>
               <p>But his attention was quickly called
from the beauties of inanimate nature,
to objects more intereſting; for he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
two perſons, whom he inſtantly
recollected to be the ſame that he had
formerly purſued over the plains. They
were ſeated on the margin of the lake,
under the ſhade of ſome high trees at
the foot of the rocks, and ſeemed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of a repaſt which was ſpread
upon the graſs. Two horſes were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
near. In the lady the duke ſaw the
very air and ſhape of Julia, and his
heart bounded at the ſight. They were
ſeated with their backs to the cliffs
upon which the duke ſtood, and he
therefore ſurveyed them unobſerved.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0793800201:218"/>
They were now almoſt within his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but the difficulty was how to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
the rocks, whoſe ſtupendous
heights, and craggy ſteeps ſeemed to
render them impaſſible. He examined
them with a ſcrutinizing eye, and at
length eſpied, where the rock receded,
a narrow winding ſort of path. He
diſmounted, and ſome of his attendants
doing the ſame, followed their lord
down the cliffs, treading lightly, leſt
their ſteps ſhould betray them. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon their reaching the bottom,
they were perceived by the lady, who
fled among the rocks, and was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purſued by the duke's people. The
cavalier had no time to eſcape, but
drew his ſword, and defended himſelf
againſt the furious aſſault of the duke.</p>
               <p>The combat was ſuſtained with much
vigour and dexterity on both ſides for
ſome minutes, when the duke received
the point of his adverſary's ſword, and
fell. The cavalier, endeavouring to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0793800201:219"/>
was ſeized by the duke's people,
who now appeared with the fair fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;—but
what was the diſappointment—the
rage of the duke, when in the
perſon of the lady he diſcovered a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger!
The aſtoniſhment was mutual, but
the accompanying feelings were, in the
different perſons, of a very oppoſite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
In the duke, aſtoniſhment was
heightened by vexation, and embittered
by diſappointment:—in the lady, it was
ſoftened by the joy of unexpected deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
               <p>This lady was the younger daughter
of a Sicilian nobleman, whoſe avarice,
or neceſſities, had devoted her to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
To avoid the threatened fate, ſhe
fled with the lover to whom her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had long been engaged, and whoſe
only fault, even in the eye of her father,
was inferiority of birth. They were now
on their way to the coaſt, whence they
deſigned to paſs over to Italy, where
the church would confirm the bonds
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0793800201:220"/>
which their hearts had already formed.
There the friends of the cavalier reſided,
and with them they expected to find a
ſecure retreat.</p>
               <p>The duke, who was not materially
wounded, after the firſt tranſport of his
rage had ſubſided, ſuffered them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
Relieved from their fears, they
joyfully ſet forward, leaving their late
purſuer to the anguiſh of defeat, and
fruitleſs endeavour. He was remounted
on his horſe; and having diſpatched two
of his people in ſearch of a houſe where
he might obtain ſome relief, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ſlowly on his return to the caſtle
of Mazzini.</p>
               <p>It was not long ere he recollected a
circumſtance which, in the firſt tumult
of his diſappointment, had eſcaped him,
but which ſo eſſentially affected the
whole tenour of his hopes, as to make
him again irreſolute how to proceed.
He conſidered that, although theſe were
the fugitives he had purſued over the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0793800201:221"/>
plains, they might not be the ſame who
had been ſecreted in the cottage, and it
was therefore poſſible that Julia might
have been the perſon whom they had
for ſome time followed from thence.
This ſuggeſtion awakened his hopes,
which were however quickly deſtroyed;
for he remembered that the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who could have ſatisfied his doubts,
were now gone beyond the power of
recall. To purſue Julia, when no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of her flight remained, was abſurd;
and he was therefore compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the marquis, as ignorant and
more hopeleſs than he had left him.
With much pain he reached the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
which his emiſſaries had diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
where fortunately he obtained ſome
medical aſſiſtance. Here he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by indiſpoſition to reſt. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of his mind equalled that of his
body. Thoſe impetuous paſſions which
ſo ſtrongly marked his nature, were
rouſed and exaſperated to a degree that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0793800201:222"/>
operated powerfully upon his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and threatened him with the moſt
alarming conſequences. The effect of
his wound was heightened by the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his mind; and a fever, which
quickly aſſumed a very ſerious aſpect,
co-operated to endanger his life.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>THE caſtle of Mazzini was ſtill
the ſcene of diſſention and miſery.
The impatience and aſtoniſhment of the
marquis being daily increaſed by the
lengthened abſence of the duke, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
ſervants to the foreſt of Maren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,
to enquire the occaſion of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.
They returned with intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that neither Julia, the duke, nor
any of his peopl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were there. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concluded, that his daughter had
fled the cottage upon information of the
approach of the duke, who, he believed,
was ſtill engaged in the purſuit. With
reſpect to Ferdinand, who yet pined
in ſorrow and anxiety in his dungeon,
the rigour of the marquis's conduct
was unabated. He apprehended that
his ſon, if liberated, would quickly
diſcover the retreat of Julia, and by
his advice and aſſiſtance, confirm her
in diſobedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0793800201:224"/>
Ferdinand in the ſtillneſs and ſolitude
of his dungeon, brooded over the late
calamity in gloomy ineffectual lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
The idea of Hippolitus—of
Hippolitus murdered—aroſe to his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
in buſy in truſion, and ſubdued
the ſtrongeſt efforts of his fortitude.
Julia too, his beloved ſiſter—unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected—unfriended—might,
even at the
moment he lamented her, be ſinking
under ſufferings dreadful to humanity.
The airy ſchemes he once formed of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
felicity, reſulting from the union
of two perſons ſo juſtly dear to him—with
the gay viſions of paſt happineſs—floated
upon his fancy, and the luſtre
they reflected, ſerved only to heighten
by contraſt, the obſcurity and gloom of
his preſent views. He had, however, a
new ſubject of aſtoniſhment, which often
withdrew his thoughts from their accuſtomed
object, and ſubſtituted a ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
leſs painful, though ſcarcely leſs
powerful. One night, as he lay rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0793800201:225"/>
on the paſt in melancholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
the ſtillneſs of the place was
ſuddenly interrupted by a low and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſound. It returned at intervals in
hollow ſighings, and ſeemed to come
from ſome perſon in deep diſtreſs. So
much did fear operate upon his mind,
that he was uncertain whether it aroſe
from within or from without. He
looked round his dungeon, but could
diſtinguiſh no object through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable
darkneſs. As he liſtened in
deep amazement, the ſound was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in moans more hollow. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
now occupied his mind, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
his reaſon; he ſtarted from his
poſture, and, determined to be ſatisfied
whether any perſon beſide himſelf was
in the dungeon, groped, with arms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
along the walls. The place was
empty, but coming to a particular ſpot,
the ſound ſuddenly aroſe more diſtinctly
to his ear. He called aloud, and aſked
who was there; but received no anſwer.
Soon after all was ſtill; and after liſtening
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0793800201:226"/>
for ſome time without hearing the
ſounds renewed, he laid himſelf down to
ſleep. On the following day he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the man who brought him
food, what he had heard, and enquired
concerning the noiſe. The ſervant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
very much terrified, but could
give no information that might in the
leaſt account for the circumſtance, till
he mentioned the vicinity of the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
to the ſouthern buildings. The
dreadful relation formerly given by
the marquis, inſtantly recurred to the
mind of Ferdinand, who did not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
to believe, that the moans he heard
came from the reſtleſs ſpirit of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
della Campo. At this conviction,
horror thrilled his nerves; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
his oath, and was ſilent. His
courage, however, yielded to the idea of
paſſing another night alone in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
where, if the vengeful ſpirit of the
murdered ſhould appear, he might even
die of the horror which its appearance
would inſpire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0793800201:227"/>
The mind of Ferdinand was highly
ſuperior to the general influence of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition;
but, in the preſent inſtance
ſuch ſtrong correlative circumſtances
appeared as compelled even incredulity
to yield. He had himſelf heard ſtrange
and awful ſounds in the forſaken ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
buildings;—he received from his
father a dreadful ſecret relative to them—a
ſecret in which his honour, nay even
his life, was bound up. His father had
alſo confeſſed, that he had himſelf there
ſeen appearances which he could never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
remember without horror, and which
had occaſioned him to quit that part of
the caſtle. All theſe recollections preſented
to Ferdinand a chain of evidence
too powerful to be reſiſted, and he could
not doubt that the ſpirit of the dead
had for once been permitted to reviſit
the earth, and to call down vengeance
on the deſcendants of the murderer.</p>
               <p>This conviction occaſioned him a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of horror, ſuch as no apprehenſion
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0793800201:228"/>
of mortal powers could have excited,
and he determined, if poſſible, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
on Peter to paſs the hours of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
with him in his dungeon. The
ſtrictneſs of Peter's fidelity yielded to
the perſuaſions of Ferdinand, though
no bribe could tempt him to incur
the reſentment of the marquis, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
an eſcape. Ferdinand paſſed
the day in lingering anxious expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the return of night brought
Peter to the dungeon. His kindneſs
expoſed him to a danger which he had
not foreſeen; for when ſeated in the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
alone with his priſoner, how eaſily
might that priſoner have conquered
him, and left him to pay his life to the
fury of the marquis. He was preſerved
by the humanity of Ferdinand, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
perceived his advantage, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to involve an innocent man in
deſtruction, and ſpurned the ſuggeſtion
from his mind.</p>
               <p>Peter, whoſe friendſhip was ſtronger
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0793800201:229"/>
than his courage, trembled with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
as the hour drew nigh in which
the groans had been heard on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
night. He recounted to Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
a variety of terrific circumſtances,
which exiſted only in the heated imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of his fellow ſervants, but which
were ſtill admitted by them as facts.
Among the reſt, he did not omit to
mention the light and the figure, which
had been ſeen to iſſue from the ſouth
tower on the night of Julia's intended
elopement; a circumſtance which he
embelliſhed with innumerable aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of fear and wonder. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with deſcribing the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
it had cauſed, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
behaviour of the marquis, who
laughed at the fears of his people, yet
condeſcended to quiet them by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
review of the buildings, whence
their terror had originated. He related
the adventure of the door, which refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to yield—the ſounds which aroſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0793800201:230"/>
from within, and the diſcovery of the
fallen roof; but declared, that neither
he, nor any of his fellow-ſervants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the noiſe, or the obſtruction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from that, "becauſe, my lord,"
continued he, "the door ſeemed to be
held only in one place; and as for the
noiſe—O! Lord! I never ſhall forget
what a noiſe it was it was a thouſand
times louder than what any ſtones could
make."</p>
               <p>Ferdinand liſtened to this narrative in
ſilent wonder!—wonder, not occaſioned
by the adventure deſcribed, but by the
hardihood and raſhneſs of the marquis,
who had thus expoſed to the inſpection
of his people, that dreadful ſpot which
he knew from experience to be the haunt
of an injured ſpirit; a ſpot which he
had hitherto ſcrupulouſly concealed
from human eye, and human curioſity;
and which, for ſo many years, he had
not dared even himſelf to enter. Peter
went on, but was preſently interrupted
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0793800201:231"/>
by a hollow moan, which ſeemed to
come from beneath the ground. "Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
virgin!" exclaimed he: Ferdinand
liſtened in awful expectation. A groan
longer and more dreadful was repeated,
when Peter ſtarting from his ſeat, and
ſnatching up the lamp, ruſhed out of
the dungeon. Ferdinand, who was left
in total darkneſs, followed to the door,
which the affrighted Peter had not
ſtopped to faſten, but which had cloſed,
and ſeemed held by a lock that could be
opened only on the outſide. The ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Ferdinand, thus compelled to
remain in the dungeon, are not to be
imagined. The horrors of the night,
whatever they were to be, he was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
alone. By degrees, however, he
ſeemed to acquire the valour of deſpair.
The ſounds were repeated at intervals
for near an hour, when ſilence returned,
and remained undiſturbed during the
reſt of the night. Ferdinand was alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by no appearance; and at length,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0793800201:232"/>
overcome with anxiety and watching,
he ſunk to repoſe.</p>
               <p>On the following morning Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the dungeon, ſcarcely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to expect, yet expecting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
very ſtrange, perhaps the murder—perhaps
the ſupernatural diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his young lord. Full of theſe
wild apprehenſions, he dared not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thither alone, but perſuaded ſome of
the ſervants, to whom he had commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icated
his terrors, to accompany him to
the door. As they paſſed along he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected,
that in the terror of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
night he had forgot to faſten the
door, and he now feared that his priſoner
had made his eſcape without a miracle.
He hurried to the door, and his ſurprize
was extreme to find it faſtened. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſtruck him that this was the
work of a ſupernatural power; when, on
calling aloud, he was anſwered by a
voice from within. His abſurd fear
did not ſuffer him to recognize the voice
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0793800201:233"/>
of Ferdinand, neither did he ſuppoſe
that Ferdinand had failed to eſcape;
he, therefore, attributed the voice to
the being he had heard on the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
night; and ſtarting back from the
door, fled with his companions to the
great hall. There the uproar occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their entrance called together a
number of perſons, amongſt whom was
the marquis, who was ſoon informed of
the cauſe of alarm, with a long hiſtory
of the circumſtances of the foregoing
night. At this information, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
aſſumed a very ſtern look, and
ſeverely reprimanded Peter for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,
at the ſame time reproaching
the other ſervants with their undutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in thus diſturbing his peace. He
reminded them of the condeſcenſion he
had practiſed to diſſipate their former
terrors, and of the reſult of their exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
He then aſſured them, that
ſince indulgence had only encouraged
intruſion, he would for the future be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0793800201:234"/>
vere; and concluded with declaring, that
the firſt man who ſhould diſturb him
with a repetition of ſuch ridiculous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
or ſhould attempt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb
the peace of the caſtle by circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
theſe idle notions, ſhould be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
puniſhed, and baniſhed his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.
They ſhrunk back at this
reproof, and were ſilent. "Bring a
torch," ſaid the marquis, "and ſhew
me to the dungeon. I will once more
condeſcend to confute you."</p>
               <p>They obeyed, and deſcended with
the marquis, who, arriving at the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
inſtantly threw open the door,
and diſcovered to the aſtoniſhed eyes of
his attendants—Ferdinand!—He ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſurprize at the entrance of his
father thus attended. The marquis
darting upon him a ſevere look, which
he perfectly comprehended—"Now,"
cried he, turning to his people, "what
do you ſee? My ſon, whom I myſelf
placed here, and whoſe voice, which
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0793800201:235"/>
anſwered to your calls, you have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into unknown ſounds. "Speak,
Ferdinand, and confirm what I ſay."
Ferdinand did ſo. "What dreadful
ſpectre appeared to you laſt night? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the marquis, looking ſtedfaſtly
upon him: gratify theſe fellows with a
deſcription of it, for they cannot exiſt
without ſomething of the marvelous."
"None my lord," replied Ferdinand,
who too well underſtood the manner of
the marquis. "Tis well," cried the
marquis, "and this is the laſt time,"
turning to his attendants, "that your
folly ſhall be treated with ſo much le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity."
He ceaſed to urge the ſubject,
and forbore to aſk Ferdinand even one
queſtion before his ſervants, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nocturnal ſounds deſcribed by
Peter. He quitted the dungeon with
eyes ſteadily bent in anger and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
upon Ferdinand. The marquis
ſuſpected that the fears of his ſon had
inadvertently betrayed to Peter a part
of the ſecret intruſted to him, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0793800201:236"/>
he artfully interrogated Peter with
ſeeming careleſsneſs, concerning the
circumſtances of the preceding night.
From him he drew ſuch anſwers as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
acquitted Ferdinand of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and relieved himſelf from tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>The following night paſſed quietly
away; neither ſound nor appearance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
the peace of Ferdinand. The
marquis, on the next day, thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to ſoften the ſeverity of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and he was removed from his dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
to a room ſtrongly grated, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the light of day.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile a circumſtance occurred
which increaſed the general diſcord, and
threatened Emilia with the loſs of her
laſt remaining comfort—the advice and
conſolation of Madame de Menon. The
marchioneſs, whoſe paſſion for the count
de Vereza had at length yielded to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and the preſſure of preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
now beſtowed her ſmiles
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0793800201:237"/>
upon a young Italian cavalier, a viſitor
at the caſtle, who poſſeſſed too much of
the ſpirit of gallantry to permit a lady
to languiſh in vain. The marquis, whoſe
mind was occupied with other paſſions,
was inſenſible to the miſconduct of his
wife, who at all times had the addreſs
to diſguiſe her vices beneath the gloſs
of virtue and innocent freedom. The
intrigue was diſcovered by Madame,
who, having one day left a book in the
oak parlour, returned thither in ſearch
of it. As ſhe opened the door of the
apartment, ſhe heard the voice of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
in paſſionate exclamation; and on
entering, diſcovered him riſing in ſome
confuſion from the feet of the marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
who, darting at Madame a look of
ſeverity, aroſe from her ſeat. Madame,
ſhocked at what ſhe had ſeen, inſtantly
retired, and buried in her own boſom
that ſecret, the diſcovery of which
would moſt eſſentially have poiſoned
the peace of the marquis. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0793800201:238"/>
who was a ſtranger to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
of ſentiment which actuated
Madame de Menon, doubted not that
ſhe would ſeize the moment of retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and expoſe her conduct where
moſt ſhe dreaded it ſhould be known.
The conſciouſneſs of guilt tortured her
with inceſſant fear of diſcovery, and
from this period her whole attention was
employed to diſlodge from the caſtle,
the perſon to whom her character was
committed. In this it was not difficult
to ſucceed; for the delicacy of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame's
feelings made her quick to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and to withdraw from a treatment
unſuitable to the natural dignity of her
character. She therefore reſolved to
depart from the caſtle; but diſdaining
to take an advantage even over a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
enemy, ſhe determined to be
ſilent on that ſubject which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
have transferred the triumph from
her adverſary to herſelf. When the
marquis, on hearing her determination
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0793800201:239"/>
to retire, earneſtly enquired for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of her conduct, ſhe forbore to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the real one, and left
him to incertitude and diſappointment.</p>
               <p>To Emilia this deſign occaſioned a
diſtreſs which almoſt ſubdued the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of Madame. Her tears and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
ſpoke the artleſs energy of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
In Madame ſhe loſt her only
friend; and ſhe too well underſtood the
value of that friend, to ſee her depart
without feeling and expreſſing the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diſtreſs. From a ſtrong attachment
to the memory of the mother, Madame
had been induced to undertake the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of her daughters, whoſe engaging
diſpoſitions had perpetuated a kind of
hereditary affection. Regard for Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
and Julia had alone for ſome time
detained her at the caſtle; but this was
now ſucceeded by the influence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
too powerful to be reſiſted.
As her income was ſmall, it was her
plan to retire to her native place, which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0793800201:240"/>
was ſituated in a diſtant part of the
iſland, and there take up her reſidence
in a convent.</p>
               <p>Emilia ſaw the time of Madame's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
approach with increaſed diſtreſs.
They left each other with a mutual ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
which did honour to their hearts.
When her laſt friend was gone, Emilia
wandered through the forſaken apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where ſhe had been accuſtomed
to converſe with Julia, and to receive
conſolation and ſympathy from her
dear inſtructreſs, with a kind of anguiſh
known only to thoſe who have experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſimilar ſituation. Madame purſued
her journey with a heavy heart. Separated
from the objects of her fondeſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and from the ſcenes and occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for which long habit had formed
claims upon her heart, ſhe ſeemed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intereſt and without motive for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion.
The world appeared a wide and
gloomy deſert, where no heart welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her with kindneſs—no countenance
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0793800201:241"/>
brightened into ſmiles at her approach.
It was many years ſince ſhe quitted Calini—and
in the interval, death had ſwept
away the few friends ſhe left there. The
future preſented a melancholy ſcene;
but ſhe had the retroſpect of years ſpent
in honourable endeavour and ſtrict inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
to cheer her heart and encourage
her hopes.</p>
               <p>But her utmoſt endeavours were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to repreſs the anxiety with which the
uncertain fate of Julia overwhelmed her.
Wild and terrific images aroſe to her
imagination. Fancy drew the ſcene;—ſhe
deepened the ſhades; and the terrific
aſpect of the objects ſhe preſented was
heighted by the obſcurity which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
them.</p>
