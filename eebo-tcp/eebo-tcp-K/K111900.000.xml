            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>PAMPHILUS to HERMIPPUS.</head>
               <p>IT has been remarked, my HERMIPPUS, that,
though the ancient philoſophers conveyed moſt
of their inſtruction in the form of dialogue,
this method of compoſition has been little practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in later ages, and has ſeldom ſucceeded in the
hands of thoſe, who have attempted it. Accurate
and regular argument, indeed, ſuch as is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of philoſophical enquirers, naturally throws
a man into the methodical and didactic manner;
where he can immediately, without preparation,
explain the point, at which he aims; and thence
<pb facs="tcp:0455900400:3"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0455900400:4"/>
proceed, without interruption, to deduce the
proofs, on which it is eſtabliſhed. To deliver a
SYSTEM in converſation ſcarcely appears natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
and while the dialogue-writer deſires, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from the direct ſtyle of compoſition, to
give a freer air to his performance, and avoid the
appearance of <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Reader,</hi> he is apt to
run into a worſe inconvenience, and convey the
image of <hi>Pedagogue</hi> and <hi>Pupil.</hi> Or if he carries
on the diſpute in the natural ſpirit of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
by throwing in a variety of topics, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
a proper balance among the ſpeakers; he
often loſes ſo much time in preparations and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that the reader will ſcarcely think himſelf
compenſated, by all the graces of dialogue, for
the order, brevity, and preciſion, which are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
to them.</p>
               <p>There are ſome ſubjects, however, to which
dialogue-writing is peculiarly adapted, and where
it is ſtill preferable to the direct and ſimple me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of compoſition.</p>
               <p>Any point of doctrine, which is ſo <hi>obvious,</hi>
that it ſcarcely admits of diſpute, but at the ſame
time ſo <hi>important,</hi> that it cannot be too often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated,
ſeems to require ſome ſuch method of
handling it; where the novelty of the manner may
compenſate the triteneſs of the ſubject, where the
vivacity of converſation may enforce the precept,
and where the variety of lights, preſented by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
perſonages and characters, may appear nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tedious nor redundant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0455900400:5"/>
Any queſtion of philoſophy, on the other hand,
which is ſo <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> that human
reaſon can reach no fixed determination with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to it; if it ſhould be treated at all; ſeems to
lead us naturally into the ſtyle of dialogue and
converſation. Reaſonable men may be allowed to
differ, where no one can reaſonably be poſitive:
Oppoſite ſentiments, even without any deciſion,
afford an agreeable amuſement: and if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be curious and intereſting, the book carries
us, in a manner, into company, and unites the
two greateſt and pureſt pleaſures of human life,
ſtudy and ſociety.</p>
               <p>Happily, theſe circumſtances are all to be found
in the ſubject of NATURAL RELIGION.
What truth ſo obvious, ſo certain, as the BEING
of a God, which the moſt ignorant ages have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
for which the moſt refined geniuſes
have ambitiouſly ſtriven to produce new proofs
and arguments? What truth ſo important as this,
which is the ground of all our hopes, the ſureſt
foundation of morality, the firmeſt ſupport of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and the only principle, which ought never
to be a moment abſent from our thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations?
But in treating of this obvious and
important truth; what obſcure queſtions occur,
concerning the NATURE of that divine being;
his attributes, his decrees, his plan of providence?
Theſe have been always ſubjected to the diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men: Concerning theſe, human reaſon
has not reached any certain determination: But
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0455900400:6"/>
theſe are topics ſo intereſting, that we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
our reſtleſs enquiry with regard to them;
though nothing but doubt, uncertainty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
have, as yet, been the reſult of our
moſt accurate reſearches.</p>
               <p>This I had lately occaſion to obſerve, while I
paſſed, as uſual, part of the ſummer-ſeaſon with
CLEANTHES, and was preſent at thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
of his with PHILO and DEMEA,
of which I gave you lately ſome imperfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Your curioſity, you then told me, was
ſo excited, that I muſt of neceſſity enter into a
more exact detail of their reaſonings, and diſplay
thoſe various ſyſtems, which they advanced with
regard to ſo delicate a ſubject as that of Natural
Religion. The remarkable contraſt in their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
ſtill farther raiſed your expectations; while
you oppoſed the accurate philoſophical turn of
CLEANTHES to the careleſs ſcepticiſm of PHILO,
or compared either of their diſpoſitions with the
rigid inflexible orthodoxy of DEMEA. My youth
rendered me a mere auditor of their diſputes; and
that curioſity natural to the early ſeaſon of life,
has ſo deeply imprinted in my memory the whole
chain and connection of their arguments, that, I
hope, I ſhall not omit or confound any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
part of them in the recital.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0455900400:7"/>
               <head>PART I.</head>
               <p>AFTER I joined the company,<note place="margin">Part I.</note> whom I
found ſitting in CLEANTHES's library,
DEMEA paid CLEANTHES ſome compliments,
on the great care, which he took of my educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and on his unwearied perſeverance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in all his friendſhips. The father of PAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHILUS,
ſaid he, was your intimate friend: The
ſon is your pupil, and may indeed be regarded as
your adopted ſon; were we to judge by the pains
which you beſtow in conveying to him every uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
branch of literature and ſcience. You are no
more wanting, I am perſuaded, in prudence than
in induſtry. I ſhall, therefore, communicate to
you a maxim which I have obſerved with regard
to my own children, that I may learn how far
it agrees with your practice. The method I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in their education is founded on the ſaying of
an ancient, <q>
                     <hi>That ſtudents of philoſophy ought
firſt to learn Logics, then Ethics, next
Phyſics, laſt of all, the Nature of the
Gods</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Chryſippus apud Plut. de repug. Stoicorum.</note>.</q> This ſcience of Natural Theology,
according to him, being the moſt profound and
abſtruſe of any, required the matureſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in its ſtudents; and none but a mind, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with all the other ſciences, can ſafely be
entruſted with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0455900400:8"/>
Are you ſo late, ſays PHILO, in teaching your
children the principles of religion? Is there no
danger of their neglecting or rejecting altogether
thoſe opinions, of which they have heard ſo
little, during the whole courſe of their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
It is only as a ſcience, replied DEMEA,
ſubjected to human reaſoning and diſputation,
that I poſtpone the ſtudy of Natural Theology.
To ſeaſon their minds with early piety is my chief
care; and by continual precept and inſtruction,
and I hope too, by example, I imprint deeply on
their tender minds an habitual reverence for all
the principles of religion. While they paſs
through every other ſcience, I ſtill remark the
uncertainty of each part, the eternal diſputations
of men, the obſcurity of all philoſophy, and the
ſtrange, ridiculous concluſions, which ſome of
the greateſt geniuſes have derived from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of mere human reaſon. Having thus tamed
their mind to a proper ſubmiſſion and ſelf-diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
I have no longer any ſcruple of opening
to them the greateſt myſteries of religion, nor
apprehend any danger from that aſſuming arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of philoſophy, which may lead them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the moſt eſtabliſhed doctrines and opinions.</p>
               <p>Your precaution, ſays PHILO, of ſeaſoning
your childrens minds with early piety, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very reaſonable; and no more than is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
in this profane and irreligious age. But
what I chiefly admire in your plan of education,
is your method of drawing advantage from the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0455900400:9"/>
very principles of philoſophy and learning, which,
by inſpiring pride and ſelf-ſufficiency, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
in all ages, been found ſo deſtructive to
the principles of religion. The vulgar, indeed,
we may remark, who are unacquainted with
ſcience and profound enquiry, obſerving the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
diſputes of the learned, have commonly a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
contempt for Philoſophy; and rivet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the faſter, by that means, in the great
points of Theology, which have been taught them.
Thoſe, who enter a little into ſtudy and enquiry,
finding many appearances of evidence in doctrines
the neweſt and moſt extraordinary, think nothing
too difficult for human reaſon; and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
breaking through all ſences, profane the
inmoſt fanctuaries of the temple. But CLEAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THES
will, I hope, agree with me, that, after
we have abandoned ignorance, the ſureſt remedy,
there is ſtill one expedient left to prevent this
profane liberty. Let DEMEA's principles be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
and cultivated: Let us become thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſible of the weakneſs, blindneſs, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
limits of human reaſon: Let us duly conſider
its uncertainty and endleſs contrarieties, even in
ſubjects of common life and practice: Let the
errors and deceits of our very ſenſes be ſet before
us; the inſuperable difficulties, which attend firſt
principles in all ſyſtems; the contradictions, which
adhere to the very ideas of matter, cauſe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
extenſion, ſpace, time, motion; and in a
word, quantity of all kinds, the object of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0455900400:10"/>
only ſcience, that can fairly pretend to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
or evidence. When theſe topics are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
in their full light, as they are by ſome
philoſophers and almoſt all divines; who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſuch confidence in this frail faculty of reaſon
as to pay any regard to its determinations in points
ſo ſublime, ſo abſtruſe, ſo remote from common
life and experience? When the coherence of the
parts of a ſtone, or even that compoſition of parts,
which renders it extended; when theſe familiar
objects, I ſay, are ſo inexplicable, and contain
circumſtances ſo repugnant and contradictory;
with what aſſurance can we decide concerning the
origin of worlds, or trace their hiſtory from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
to eternity?</p>
               <p>While PHILO pronounced theſe words, I could
obſerve a ſmile in the countenance both of DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEA
and CLEANTHES. That of DEMEA ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to imply an unreſerved ſatisfaction in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
delivered: But in CLEANTHES's features,
I could diſtinguiſh an air of fineſſe; as if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſome raillery or artificial malice in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
of PHILO.</p>
               <p>You propoſe then, PHILO, ſaid CLEANTHES,
to erect religious faith on philoſophical ſcepticiſm;
and you think, that if certainty or evidence be
expelled from every other ſubject of enquiry, it
will all retire to theſe theological doctrines, and
there acquire a ſuperior force and authority.
Whether your ſcepticiſm be as abſolute and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
as you pretend, we ſhall learn by and by,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0455900400:11"/>
when the company breaks up: We ſhall then ſee,
whether you go out at the door or the window;
and whether you really doubt, if your body has
gravity, or can be injured by its fall; according
to popular opinion, derived from our fallacious
ſenſes and more fallacious experience. And this
conſideration, DEMEA, may, I think, fairly ſerve
to abate our ill-will to this humorous ſect of
the ſceptics. If they be thoroughly in earneſt,
they will not long trouble the world with their
doubts, cavils, and diſputes: If they be only in
jeſt, they are, perhaps, bad ralliers, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be very dangerous, either to the ſtate, to
philoſophy, or to religion.</p>
               <p>In reality, PHILO, continued he, it ſeems cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that though a man, in a fluſh of humour,
after intenſe reflection on the many contradictions
and imperfections of human reaſon, may entirely
renounce all belief and opinion; it is impoſſible
for him to perſevere in this total ſcepticiſm, or
make it appear in his conduct for a few hours.
External objects preſs in upon him: Paſſions ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit
him: His philoſophical melancholy diſſipates;
and even the utmoſt violence upon his own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
will not be able, during any time, to preſerve
the poor appearance of ſcepticiſm. And for what
reaſon impoſe on himſelf ſuch a violence? This
is a point, in which it will be impoſſible for him
ever to ſatisfy himſelf, conſiſtently with his ſceptical
principles: So that upon the whole nothing could
be more ridiculous than the principles of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0455900400:12"/>
PYRRHONIANS; if in reality they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
as is pretended, to extend throughout,
the ſame ſcepticiſm, which they had learned from
the declamations of their ſchools, and which they
ought to have confined to them.</p>
               <p>In this view, there appears a great reſemblance
between the ſects of the STOICS and PYRRHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIANS,
though perpetual antagoniſts: and both
of them ſeem founded on this erroneous maxim,
That what a man can perform ſometimes, and in
ſome diſpoſitions, he can perform always, and in
every diſpoſition. When the mind, by Stoical
reflections, is elevated into a ſublime enthuſiaſm
of virtue, and ſtrongly ſmit with any <hi>ſpecies</hi> of
honour or public good, the utmoſt bodily pain
and ſufferance will not prevail over ſuch a high
ſenſe of duty; and 'tis poſſible, perhaps, by its
means, even to ſmile and exult in the midſt of
tortures. If this ſometimes may be the caſe in
fact and reality, much more may a philoſopher,
in his ſchool, or even in his cloſet, work himſelf
up to ſuch an enthuſiaſm, and ſupport in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
the acuteſt pain or moſt calamitous event,
which he can poſſibly conceive. But how ſhall
he ſupport this enthuſiaſm itſelf? The bent of
his mind relaxes, and cannot be recalled at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
Avocations lead him aſtray: Misfortunes
attack him unawares: And the <hi>philoſopher</hi>
ſinks by degrees into the <hi>plebeian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I allow of your compariſon between the STOICS
and SCEPTICS, replied PHILO. But you may

obſerve, at the ſame time, that though the mind
cannot, in Stoiciſm, ſupport the higheſt flights of
philoſophy, yet even when it ſinks lower, it ſtill
retains ſomewhat of its former diſpoſition; and
the effects of the Stoic's reaſoning will appear in
his conduct in common life, and through the
whole tenor of his actions. The ancient ſchools,
particularly that of ZENO, produced examples of
virtue and conſtancy, which ſeem aſtoniſhing to
preſent times.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Vain Wiſdom all and falſe Philoſophy.</l>
                  <l>Yet with a pleaſing ſorcery could charm</l>
                  <l>Pain, for a while, or anguiſh, and excite</l>
                  <l>Fallacious Hope, or arm the obdurate breaſt</l>
                  <l>With ſtubborn Patience, as with triple ſteel.</l>
               </q>
               <p>In like manner, if a man has accuſtomed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſceptical conſiderations on the uncertainty
and narrow limits of reaſon, he will not entirely
forget them when he turns his reflection on
other ſubjects; but in all his philoſophical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and reaſoning, I dare not ſay, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conduct, he will be found different from
thoſe, who either never formed any opinions in
the caſe, or have entertained ſentiments more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to human reaſon.</p>
               <p>To whatever length any one may puſh his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
principles of ſcepticiſm, he muſt act, I
own, and live, and converſe like other men;
and for this conduct he is not obliged to give
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0455900400:14"/>
any other reaſon, than the abſolute neceſſity he
lies under of ſo doing. If he ever carries his
ſpeculations farther than this neceſſity conſtrains
him, and philoſophiſes, either on natural or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſubjects, he is allured by a certain pleaſure
and ſatisfaction, which he finds in employing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
after that manner. He conſiders beſides,
that every one, even in common life, is conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have more or leſs of this philoſophy; that
from our earlieſt infancy we make continual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
in forming more general principles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and reaſoning; that the larger experience
we acquire, and the ſtronger reaſon we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with, we always render our principles the
more general and comprehenſive; and that what
we call <hi>philoſophy</hi> is nothing but a more regular
and methodical operation of the ſame kind. To
philoſophiſe on ſuch ſubjects is nothing eſſentially
different from reaſoning on common life; and
we may only expect greater ſtability, if not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
truth, from our philoſophy, on account of its
exacter and more ſcrupulous method of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But when we look beyond human affairs and
the properties of the ſurrounding bodies: When
we carry our ſpeculations into the two eternities,
before and after the preſent ſtate of things; into
the creation and formation of the univerſe; the
exiſtence and properties of ſpirits; the powers
and operations of one univerſal ſpirit, exiſting
without beginning and without end; omnipotent,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0455900400:15"/>
omniſcient, immutable, infinite, and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible:
We muſt be far removed from the
ſmalleſt tendency to ſcepticiſm not to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
that we have here got quite beyond the
reach of our faculties. So long as we confine our
ſpeculations to trade, or morals, or politics, or
criticiſm, we make appeals, every moment, to
common ſenſe and experience, which ſtrengthen
our philoſophical concluſions, and remove (at
leaſt, in part) the ſuſpicion, which we ſo juſtly
entertain with regard to every reaſoning, that is
very ſubtile and refined. But in theological rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
we have not this advantage; while at the
ſame time we are employed upon objects, which,
we muſt be ſenſible, are too large for our graſp,
and of all others, require moſt to be familiariſed
to our apprehenſion. We are like foreigners in
a ſtrange country, to whom every thing muſt
ſeem ſuſpicious, and who are in danger every
moment of tranſgreſſing againſt the laws and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of the people, with whom they live and
converſe. We know not how far we ought to
truſt our vulgar methods of reaſoning in ſuch a
ſubject; ſince, even in common life and in that
province, which is peculiarly appropriated to them,
we cannot account for them, and are entirely
guided by a kind of inſtinct or neceſſity in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
them.</p>
               <p>All ſceptics pretend, that, if reaſon be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in an abſtract view, it furniſhes invincible
arguments againſt itſelf, and that we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0455900400:16"/>
retain any conviction or aſſurance, on any
ſubject, were not the ſceptical reaſonings ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
and ſubtile, that they are not able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe
the more ſolid and more natural argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
derived from the ſenſes and experience.
But it is evident, whenever our arguments loſe
this advantage, and run wide of common life,
that the moſt refined ſcepticiſm comes to be upon
a footing with them, and is able to oppoſe and
counterbalance them. The one has no more
weight than the other. The mind muſt remain
in ſuſpenſe between them; and it is that very
ſuſpenſe or balance, which is the triumph of
ſcepticiſm.</p>
               <p>But I obſerve, ſays CLEANTHES, with regard
to you, PHILO, and all ſpeculative ſceptics, that
your doctrine and practice are as much at variance
in the moſt abſtruſe points of theory as in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of common life. Where-ever evidence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
itſelf, you adhere to it, notwithſtanding
your pretended ſcepticiſm; and I can obſerve too
ſome of your ſect to be as deciſive as thoſe, who
make greater profeſſions of certainty and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
In reality, would not a man be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
who pretended to reject NEWTON's expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the wonderful phenomenon of the rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,
becauſe that explication gives a minute ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
of the rays of light; a ſubject, forſooth,
too refined for human comprehenſion? And what
would you ſay to one, who having nothing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to object to the arguments of COPERNICUS
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0455900400:17"/>
and GALILAEO for the motion of the earth,
ſhould with-hold his aſſent, on that general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
That theſe ſubjects were too magnificent
and remote to be explained by the narrow and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious
reaſon of mankind?</p>
               <p>There is indeed a kind of brutiſh and ignorant
ſcepticiſm, as you well obſerved, which gives the
vulgar a general prejudice againſt what they do
not eaſily underſtand, and makes them reject e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
principle, which requires elaborate reaſoning
to prove and eſtabliſh it. This ſpecies of ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm
is fatal to knowledge, not to religion; ſince
we find, that thoſe who make greateſt profeſſion
of it, give often their aſſent, not only to the great
truths of Theiſm, and natural theology, but even
to the moſt abſurd tenets, which a traditional ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
has recommended to them. They firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe in witches; though they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nor attend to the moſt ſimple propoſition of
EUCLID. But the refined and philoſophical ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
fall into an inconſiſtence of an oppoſite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
They puſh their reſearches into the moſt
abſtruſe corners of ſcience; and their aſſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
them in every ſtep, proportioned to the
evidence, which they meet with. They are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
obliged to acknowledge, that the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe
and remote objects are thoſe, which are
beſt explained by philoſophy. Light is in reality
anatomized: The true ſyſtem of the heavenly
bodies is diſcovered and aſcertained. But the
nouriſhment of bodies by food is ſtill an inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0455900400:18"/>
myſtery: The coheſion of the parts of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is ſtill incomprehenſible. Theſe ſceptics, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are obliged, in every queſtion, to conſider
each particular evidence apart, and proportion
their aſſent to the preciſe degree of evidence,
which occurs. This is their practice in all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
mathematical, moral, and political ſcience.
And why not the ſame, I aſk, in the theological
and religious? Why muſt concluſions of this
nature be alone rejected on the general preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the inſufficiency of human reaſon, without
any particular diſcuſſion of the evidence? Is not
ſuch an unequal conduct a plain proof of prejudice
and paſſion?</p>
               <p>Our ſenſes, you ſay, are fallacious, our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
erroneous, our ideas even of the moſt
familiar objects, extenſion, duration, motion,
full of abſurdities and contradictions. You defy
me to ſolve the difficulties, or reconcile the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies,
which you diſcover in them. I have not
capacity for ſo great an undertaking: I have not
leiſure for it: I perceive it to be ſuperfluous.
Your own conduct, in every circumſtance, refutes
your principles; and ſhows the firmeſt reliance
on all the received maxims of ſcience, morals,
prudence, and behaviour.</p>
               <p>I ſhall never aſſent to ſo harſh an opinion as that
of a celebrated writer<note n="*" place="bottom">L'art de penſer.</note>, who ſays, that the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
are not a ſect of philoſophers: They are only
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0455900400:19"/>
a ſect of liars. I may, however, affirm, (I hope,
without offence) that they are a ſect of jeſters or
ralliers. But for my part, whenever I find myſelf
diſpoſed to mirth and amuſement, I ſhall certainly
chuſe my entertainment of a leſs perplexing and
abſtruſe nature. A comedy, a novel, or at moſt
a hiſtory, ſeems a more natural recreation than
ſuch metaphyſical ſubtilties and abſtractions.</p>
               <p>In vain would the ſceptic make a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſcience and common life, or between one
ſcience and another. The arguments, employed
in all, if juſt, are of a ſimilar nature, and contain
the ſame force and evidence. Or if there be any
difference among them, the advantage lies entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the ſide of theology and natural religion.
Many principles of mechanics are founded on very
abſtruſe reaſoning; yet no man, who has any
pretenſions to ſcience, even no ſpeculative ſceptic,
pretends to entertain the leaſt doubt with regard
to them. The COPERNICAN ſyſtem contains
the moſt ſurpriſing paradox, and the moſt contrary
to our natural conceptions, to appearances, and
to our very ſenſes: yet even monks and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
are now conſtrained to withdraw their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to it. And ſhall PHILO, a man of ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
a genius, and extenſive knowledge, entertain
any general undiſtinguiſhed ſcruples with regard
to the religious hypotheſis, which is founded on
the ſimpleſt and moſt obvious arguments, and,
unleſs it meets with artificial obſtacles, has ſuch
eaſy acceſs and admiſſion into the mind of man?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0455900400:20"/>
And here we may obſerve, continued he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf towards DEMEA, a pretty curious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
in the hiſtory of the ſciences. After
the union of philoſophy with the popular religion,
upon the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was more uſual, among all religious teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
than declamations againſt reaſon, againſt the
ſenſes, againſt every principle, derived merely
from human reſearch and enquiry. All the topics
of the ancient Academics were adopted by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and thence propagated for ſeveral ages in
every ſchool and pulpit throughout Chriſtendom.
The Reformers embraced the ſame principles of
reaſoning, or rather declamation; and all pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrics
on the excellency of faith were ſure to be interlarded with ſome ſevere ſtrokes of ſatire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
natural reaſon. A celebrated prelate too<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſ Huet.</note>,
of the Romiſh communion, a man of the moſt
extenſive learning, who wrote a demonſtration of
Chriſtianity, has alſo compoſed a treatiſe, which
contains all the cavils of the boldeſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
PYRRHONISM. LOCKE ſeems to have
been the firſt Chriſtian, who ventured openly to
aſſert, that <hi>faith</hi> was nothing but a ſpecies of
<hi>reaſon,</hi> that religion was only a branch of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
and that a chain of arguments, ſimilar to that which eſtabliſhed any truth in morals, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,
or phyſics, was always employed in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the principles of theology, natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0455900400:21"/>
The ill uſe, which BAYLE and other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines
made of the philoſophical ſcepticiſm of
the fathers and firſt reformers, ſtill farther propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
the judicious ſentiment of Mr LOCKE: and
it is now, in a manner, avowed, by all pretenders
to reaſoning and philoſophy, that Atheiſt and
Sceptic are almoſt ſynonymous. And as is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that no man is in earneſt, when he profeſſes
the latter principle; I would fain hope, that there
are as few, who ſeriouſly maintain the former.</p>
               <p>Don't you remember, ſaid PHILO, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſaying of Lord BACON on this head? That a
little philoſophy, replied CLEANTHES, makes a
man an Atheiſt: a great deal converts him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
That is a very judicious remark too, ſaid
PHILO. But what I have in my eye is another
paſſage, where, having mentioned DAVID's fool,
who ſaid in his heart there is no God, this great
philoſopher obſerves, that the Atheiſts now-a-days
have a double ſhare of folly: for they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to ſay in their hearts there is no God, but
they alſo utter that impiety with their lips, and are
thereby guilty of multiplied indiſcretion and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence.
Such people, though they were ever
ſo much in earneſt, cannot, methinks, be very
formidable.</p>
               <p>But though you ſhould rank me in this claſs of
fools, I cannot forbear communicating a remark,
that occurs to me from the hiſtory of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and irreligious ſcepticiſm, with which you
have entertained us. It appears to me, that there
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0455900400:22"/>
are ſtrong ſymptoms of prieſtcraft in the whole
progreſs of this affair. During ignorant ages,
ſuch as thoſe which followed the diſſolution of the
ancient ſchools, the prieſts perceived, that Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,
Deiſm, or hereſy of any kind, could only
proceed from the preſumptuous queſtioning of
received opinions, and from a belief, that human
reaſon was equal to every thing. Education had
then a mighty influence over the minds of men,
and was almoſt equal in force to thoſe ſuggeſtions
of the ſenſes and common underſtanding, by
which the moſt determined ſceptic muſt allow
himſelf to be governed. But at preſent, when
the influence of education is much diminiſhed,
and men, from a more open commerce of the
world, have learned to compare the popular prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of different nations and ages, our ſagacious
divines have changed their whole ſyſtem of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
and talk the language of STOICS, PLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TONISTS,
and PERIPATETICS, not that of
PYRRHONIANS and ACADEMICS. If we diſtruſt
human reaſon, we have now no other principle to
lead us into religion. Thus, ſceptics in one age,
dogmatiſts in another; whichever ſyſtem beſt
ſuits the purpoſe of theſe reverend gentlemen, in
giving them an aſcendant over mankind, they are
ſure to make it their favorite principle, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
tenet.</p>
               <p>It is very natural, ſaid CLEANTHES, for men
to embrace thoſe principles, by which they find
they can beſt defend their doctrines; nor need we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0455900400:23"/>
have any recourſe to prieſtcraft to account for ſo
reaſonable an expedient. And ſurely, nothing
can afford a ſtronger preſumption, that any ſet of
principles are true, and ought to be embraced,
than to obſerve, that they tend to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of true religion, and ſerve to confound the
cavils of Atheiſts, Libertines, and Freethinkers of
all denominations.</p>
            </div>

               <head>PART II.</head>
               <p>I muſt own, CLEANTHES, ſaid DEMEA,
that nothing can more ſurpriſe me, than the light,
in which you have, all along, put this argument.
By the whole tenor of your diſcourſe, one would
imagine that you were maintaining the Being of
a God, againſt the cavils of Atheiſts and Infidels;
and were neceſſitated to become a champion for
that fundamental principle of all religion. But this,
I hope, is not, by any means, a queſtion among
us. No man; no man, at leaſt, of common
ſenſe, I am perſuaded, ever entertained a ſerious
doubt with regard to a truth, ſo certain and ſelf-evident.
The queſtion is not concerning the
BEING, but the NATURE of GOD. This I
affirm, from the infirmities of human underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to be altogether incomprehenſible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us. The eſſence of that ſupreme mind,
his attributes, the manner of his exiſtence, the
very nature of his duration; theſe and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0455900400:24"/>
which regards ſo divine a Being,<note place="margin">Part II.</note> are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
to men. Finite, weak, and blind crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
we ought to humble ourſelves in his auguſt
preſence, and, conſcious of our frailties, adore
in ſilence his infinite perfections, which eye hath
not ſeen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it
entered into the heart of man to conceive.
They are covered in a deep cloud from human
curioſity: It is profaneneſs to attempt penetrating
through theſe ſacred obſcurities: And next to
the impiety of denying his exiſtence, is the teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of prying into his nature and eſſence, decrees
and attributes.</p>
               <p>But leſt you ſhould think, that my <hi>piety</hi> has here
got the better of my <hi>philoſophy,</hi> I ſhall ſupport
my opinion, if it needs any ſupport, by a very
great authority. I might cite all the divines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
from the foundation of Chriſtianity, who
have ever treated of this or any other theological
ſubject: But I ſhall confine myſelf, at preſent, to
one equally celebrated for piety and philoſophy.
It is Father MALEBRANCHE, who, I remember,
thus expreſſes himſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Recherche de la Verité liv. 3. chap. 9.</bibl>
                  </note>. <q>One ought not ſo
much (ſays he) to call God a ſpirit, in order
to expreſs poſitively what he is, as in order to
ſignify that he is not matter. He is a Being
infinitely perfect: Of this we cannot doubt.
But in the ſame manner as we ought not to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine,
even ſuppoſing him corporeal, that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0455900400:25"/>
is clothed with a human body, as the AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THROPOMORPHITES
aſſerted, under colour
that that figure was the moſt perfect of any;
ſo neither ought we to imagine, that the Spirit
of God has human ideas, or bears any reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to our ſpirit; under colour that we
know nothing more perfect than a human mind.
We ought rather to believe, that as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the perfections of matter without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
material........he comprehends alſo
the perfections of created ſpirits, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpirit, in the manner we conceive ſpirit:
That his true name is, <hi>He that is,</hi> or in other
words, Being without reſtriction, All Being,
the Being infinite and univerſal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After ſo great an authority, DEMEA, replied
PHILO, as that which you have produced, and
a thouſand more, which you might produce, it
would appear ridiculous in me to add my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or expreſs my approbation of your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
But furely, where reaſonable men treat
theſe ſubjects, the queſtion can never be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Being,</hi> but only the <hi>Nature</hi> of the
Deity. The ſormer truth, as you well obſerve,
is unqueſtionable and ſelf-evident. Nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts
without a cauſe; and the original cauſe of
this univerſe (whatever it be) we call GOD;
and piouſly aſcribe to him every ſpecies of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whoever ſcruples this fundamental truth,
deſerves every puniſhment, which can be inflicted
among philoſophers, to wit, the greateſt ridicule,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0455900400:26"/>
contempt and diſapprobation. But as all perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is entirely relative, we ought never to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that we comprehend the attributes of this
divine Being, or to ſuppoſe, that his perfections
have any analogy or likeneſs to the perfections
of a human creature. Wiſdom, Thought, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
Knowledge; theſe we juſtly aſcribe to him;
becauſe theſe words are honourable among men,
and we have no other language or other concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by which we can expreſs our adoration of
him. But let us beware, left we think, that
our ideas any wiſe correſpond to his perfections,
or that his attributes have any reſemblance to
theſe qualities among men. He is infinitely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to our limited view and comprehenſion;
and is more the object of worſhip in the temple
than of diſputation in the ſchools.</p>
               <p>In reality, CLEANTHES, continued he, there
is no need of having recourſe to that affected
ſcepticiſm, ſo diſpleaſing to you, in order to come
at this determination. Our ideas reach no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than our experience: We have no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of divine attributes and operations: I need
not conclude my ſyllogiſm: You can draw the
inference yourſelf. And it is a pleaſure to me
(and I hope to you too) that juſt reaſoning and
ſound piety here concur in the ſame concluſion,
and both of them eſtabliſh the adorably myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and incomprehenſible nature of the Supreme
Being.</p>
               <p>Not to loſe any time in circumlocutions, ſaid
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0455900400:27"/>
CLEANTHES, addreſſing himſelf to DEMEA,
much leſs in replying to the pious declamations of
PHILO; I ſhall briefly explain how I conceive
this matter. Look round the world: contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
the whole and every part of it: You will
find it to be nothing but one great machine,
ſubdivided into an infinite number of leſſer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,
which again admit of ſubdiviſions, to a
degree beyond what human ſenſes and faculties
can trace and explain. All theſe various ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,
and even their moſt minute parts, are
adjuſted to each other with an accuracy, which
raviſhes into admiration all men, who have ever
contemplated them. The curious adapting of
means to ends, throughout all nature, reſembles
exactly, though it much exceeds, the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of human contrivance; of human deſign,
thought, wiſdom, and intelligence. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the effects reſemble each other, we are
led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the
cauſes alſo reſemble; and that the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſomewhat ſimilar to the mind of man;
though poſſeſſed of much larger faculties, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the grandeur of the work, which
he has executed. By this argument <hi>a poſteriori,</hi>
and by this argument alone, do we prove at once
the exiſtence of a Deity, and his ſimilarity to
human mind and intelligence.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be ſo free, CLEANTHES, ſaid DEMEA,
as to tell you, that from the beginning I could
not approve of your concluſion concerning the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0455900400:28"/>
ſimilarity of the Deity to men; ſtill leſs can I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of the mediums, by which you endeavour
to eſtabliſh it. What! No demonſtration of the
Being of a God! No abſtract arguments! No
proofs <hi>a priori!</hi> Are theſe, which have hitherto
been ſo much inſiſted on by philoſophers, all fallacy,
all ſophiſm? Can we reach no farther in this ſubject
than experience and probability? I will not ſay,
that this is betraying the cauſe of a Deity: But
ſurely, by this affected candor, you give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to Atheiſts, which they never could obtain,
by the mere dint of argument and reaſoning.</p>
               <p>What I chiefly ſcruple in this ſubject, ſaid
PHILO, is not ſo much, that all religious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are by CLEANTHES reduced to experience,
as that they appear not to be even the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and irrefragable of that inferior kind. That
a ſtone will fall, that fire will burn, that the
earth has ſolidity, we have obſerved a thouſand
and a thouſand times; and when any new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of this nature is preſented, we draw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
heſitation the accuſtomed inference. The
exact ſimilarity of the caſes gives us a perfect aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of a ſimilar event; and a ſtronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is never deſired nor ſought after. But
where-ever you depart, in the leaſt, from the
ſimilarity of the caſes, you diminiſh proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
the evidence; and may at laſt bring it to a
very weak <hi>analogy,</hi> which is confeſſedly liable to
error and uncertainty. After having experienced
the circulation of the blood in human creatures,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0455900400:29"/>
we make no doubt, that it takes place in TITIUS
and MAEVIUS: But from its circulation in frogs
and fiſhes, it is only a preſumption, though a
ſtrong one, from analogy, that it takes place in
men and other animals. The analogical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is much weaker, when we infer the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſap in vegetables from our experience,
that the blood circulates in animals; and thoſe,
who haſtily followed that imperfect analogy, are
found, by more accurate experiments, to have
been miſtaken.</p>
               <p>If we ſee a houſe, CLEANTHES, we conclude,
with the greateſt certainty, that it had an archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
or builder; becauſe this is preciſely that
ſpecies of effect, which we have experienced to
proceed from that ſpecies of cauſe. But ſurely
you will not affirm, that the univerſe bears ſuch
a reſemblance to a houſe, that we can with the
ſame certainty infer a ſimilar cauſe, or that the
analogy is here entire and perfect. The diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
is ſo ſtriking, that the utmoſt you can
here pretend to is a gueſs, a conjecture, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
concerning a ſimilar cauſe; and how
that pretenſion will be received in the world, I
leave you to conſider.</p>
               <p>It would ſurely be very ill received, replied
CLEANTHES; and I ſhould be deſervedly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and deteſted, did I allow, that the proofs
of a Deity amounted to no more than a gueſs or
conjecture. But is the whole adjuſtment of
means to ends in a houſe and in the univerſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0455900400:30"/>
ſo ſlight a reſemblance? The oeconomy of final
cauſes? The order, proportion, and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of every part? Steps of a ſtair are plainly
contrived, that human legs may uſe them in
mounting; and this inference is certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.
Human legs are alſo contrived for walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and mounting; and this inference, I allow,
is not altogether ſo certain, becauſe of the diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
which you remark; but does it, therefore,
deſerve the name only of preſumption or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture?</p>
               <p>Good God! cried DEMEA, interrupting him,
where are we? Zealous defenders of religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the proofs of a Deity fall ſhort of
perfect evidence! And you, PHILO, on whoſe
aſſiſtance I depended, in proving the adorable
myſteriouſneſs of the Divine Nature, do you aſſent
to all theſe extravagant opinions of CLEANTHES?
For what other name can I give them? Or why
ſpare my cenſure, when ſuch principles are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
ſupported by ſuch an authority, before
ſo young a man as PAMPHILUS?</p>
               <p>You ſeem not to apprehend, replied PHILO,
that I argue with CLEANTHES in his own way;
and by ſhowing him the dangerous conſequences
of his tenets, hope at laſt to reduce him to our
opinion. But what ſticks moſt with you, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
is the repreſentation which CLEANTHES
has made of the argument <hi>a poſteriori;</hi> and
finding, that that argument is likely to eſcape your
hold and vaniſh into air, you think it ſo diſguiſed,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0455900400:31"/>
that you can ſcarcely believe it to be ſet in its
true light. Now, however much I may diſſent,
in other reſpects, from the dangerous principles
of CLEANTHES, I muſt allow, that he has fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repreſented that argument; and I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
ſo to ſtate the matter to you, that you will
entertain no farther ſcruples with regard to it.</p>
               <p>Were a man to abſtract from every thing
which he knows or has ſeen, he would be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incapable, merely from his own ideas, to
determine what kind of ſcene the univerſe muſt
be, or to give the preference to one ſtate or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of things above another. For as nothing
which he clearly conceives, could be eſteemed
impoſſible or implying a contradiction, every chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera
of his fancy would be upon an equal foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
nor could he aſſign any juſt reaſon, why he
adheres to one idea or ſyſtem, and rejects the
others, which are equally poſſible.</p>
               <p>Again; after he opens his eyes, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates
the world, as it really is, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him, at firſt, to aſſign the cauſe of
any one event; much leſs, of the whole of things
or of the univerſe. He might ſet his Fancy a
rambling; and ſhe might bring him in an infinite
variety of reports and repreſentations. Theſe
would all be poſſible; but being all equally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
he would never, of himſelf, give a ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
account for his preferring one of them to the
reſt. Experience alone can point out to him the
true cauſe of any phenomenon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0455900400:32"/>
Now according to this method of reaſoning,
DEMEA, it follows (and is, indeed, tacitly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by CLEANTHES himſelf) that order, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement,
or the adjuſtment of final cauſes is
not, of itſelf, any proof of deſign; but only ſo
far as it has been experienced to proceed from
that principle. For aught we can know <hi>a priori,</hi>
matter may contain the ſource or ſpring of order
originally, within itſelf, as well as mind does;
and there is no more difficulty in conceiving,
that the ſeveral elements, from an internal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
cauſe, may fall into the moſt exquiſite ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement,
than to conceive that their ideas, in
the great, univerſal mind, from a like internal,
unknown cauſe, fall into that arrangement. The
equal poſſibility of both theſe ſuppoſitions is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
But by experience we find, (according
to CLEANTHES) that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. Throw ſeveral pieces of ſteel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
without ſhape or form; they will never
arrange themſelves ſo as to compoſe a watch:
Stone, and mortar, and wood, without an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect,
never erect a houſe. But the ideas in
a human mind, we ſee, by an unknown, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
oeconomy, arrange themſelves ſo as to
form the plan of a watch or houſe. Experience,
therefore, proves, that there is an original prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of order in mind, not in matter. From
ſimilar effects we infer ſimilar cauſes. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment
of means to ends is alike in the univerſe,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0455900400:33"/>
as in a machine of human contrivance. The
cauſes, therefore, muſt be reſembling.</p>
               <p>I was from the beginning ſcandaliſed, I muſt
own, with this reſemblance, which is aſſerted,
between the Deity and human creatures; and
muſt conceive it to imply ſuch a degradation of
the Supreme Being as no found Theiſt could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.
With your aſſiſtance, therefore, DEMEA,
I ſhall endeavour to defend what you juſtly call
the adorable myſteriouſneſs of the Divine Nature,
and ſhall refute this reaſoning of CLEANTHES;
provided he allows, that I have made a fair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of it.</p>
               <p>When CLEANTHES had aſſented, PHILO, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a ſhort pauſe, proceeded in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>That all inferences, CLEANTHES, concerning
fact, are founded on experience, and that all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
reaſonings are founded on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
that ſimilar cauſes prove ſimilar effects,
and ſimilar effects ſimilar cauſes; I ſhall not, at
preſent, much diſpute with you. But obſerve, I
intreat you, with what extreme caution all juſt
reaſoners proceed in the transferring of experiments
to ſimilar caſes. Unleſs the caſes be exactly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar,
they repoſe no perfect confidence in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
their paſt obſervation to any particular phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon.
Every alteration of circumſtances oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
a doubt concerning the event; and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
new experiments to prove certainly, that
the new circumſtances are of no moment or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0455900400:34"/>
A change in bulk, ſituation, arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
age, diſpoſition of the air, or ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bodies; any of theſe particulars may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with the moſt unexpected conſequences:
And unleſs the objects be quite familiar to us, it
is the higheſt temerity to expect with aſſurance,
after any of theſe changes, an event ſimilar to
that which before fell under our obſervation. The
ſlow and deliberate ſteps of philoſophers, here, if
any where, are diſtinguiſhed from the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
march of the vulgar, who, hurried on by
the ſmalleſt ſimilitude, are incapable of all diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or conſideration.</p>
               <p>But can you think, CLEANTHES, that your
uſual phlegm and philoſophy have been preſerved
in ſo wide a ſtep as you have taken, when you
compared to the univerſe houſes, ſhips, furniture,
machines; and from their ſimilarity in ſome
circumſtances inferred a ſimilarity in their cauſes?
Thought, deſign, intelligence, ſuch as we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in men and other animals, is no more than
one of the ſprings and principles of the univerſe,
as well as heat or cold, attraction or repulſion,
and a hundred others, which fall under daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
It is an active cauſe, by which ſome
particular parts of nature, we find, produce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
on other parts. But can a concluſion,
with any propriety, be transferred from parts to
the whole? Does not the great diſproportion
bar all compariſon and inference? From obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the growth of a hair, can we learn any thing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0455900400:35"/>
concerning the generation of a man? Would the
manner of a leaf's blowing, even though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
known, afford us any inſtruction concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the vegetation of a tree?</p>
               <p>But allowing that we were to take the <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of one part of nature upon another for the
foundation of our judgement concerning the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi>
of the whole (which never can be admitted)
yet why ſelect ſo minute, ſo weak, ſo bounded a
principle as the reaſon and deſign of animals is
found to be upon this planet? What peculiar
privilege has this little agitation of the brain which
we call <hi>thought,</hi> that we muſt thus make it the
model of the whole univerſe? Our partiality in
our own favour does indeed preſent it on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
but ſound philoſophy ought carefully to
guard againſt ſo natural an illuſion.</p>
               <p>So far from admitting, continued PHILO, that
the operations of a part can afford us any juſt
concluſion concerning the origin of the whole, I
will not allow any one part to form a rule for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
part, if the latter be very remote from the
former. Is there any reaſonable ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the inhabitants of other planets poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
thought, intelligence, reaſon, or any thing
ſimilar to theſe faculties in men? When Nature
has ſo extremely diverſified her manner of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this ſmall globe; can we imagine, that
ſhe inceſſantly copies herſelf throughout ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
a univerſe? And if thought, as we may
well ſuppoſe, be confined merely to this narrow
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0455900400:36"/>
corner, and has even there ſo limited a ſphere of
action; with what propriety can we aſſign it for
the original cauſe of all things? The narrow
views of a peaſant, who makes his domeſtic oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy
the rule for the government of kingdoms,
is in compariſon a pardonable ſophiſm.</p>
               <p>But were we ever ſo much aſſured, that a
thought and reaſon, reſembling the human, were
to be found throughout the whole univerſe, and
were its activity elſewhere vaſtly greater and more
commanding than it appears in this globe: yet I
cannot ſee, why the operations of a world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,
arranged, adjuſted, can with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
be extended to a world, which is in its
embryo-ſtate, and is advancing towards that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
and arrangement. By obſervation, we
know ſomewhat of the oeconomy, action, and
nouriſhment of a finiſhed animal; but we muſt
transfer with great caution that obſervation to the
growth of a foetus in the womb, and ſtill more,
to the formation of an animalcule in the loins of
its male parent. Nature, we find, even from
our limited experience, poſſeſſes an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſprings and principles, which inceſſantly
diſcover themſelves on every change of her poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſituation. And what new and unknown
principles would actuate her in ſo new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
a ſituation, as that of the formation of a
univerſe, we cannot, without the utmoſt temerity,
pretend to determine.</p>
               <p>A very ſmall part of this great ſyſtem, during
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0455900400:37"/>
a very ſhort time, is very imperfectly diſcovered
to us: and do we thence pronounce deciſively
concerning the origin of the whole?</p>
               <p>Admirable concluſion! Stone, wood, brick,
iron, braſs, have not, at this time, in this minute
globe of earth, an order or arrangement without
human art and contrivance: therefore the univerſe
could not originally attain its order and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without ſomething ſimilar to human art.
But is a part of nature a rule for another part
very wide of the former? Is it a rule for the
whole? Is a very ſmall part a rule for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe?
Is nature in one ſituation, a certain rule
for nature in another ſituation, vaſtly different
from the former?</p>
               <p>And can you blame me, CLEANTHES, if I
here imitate the prudent reſerve of SIMONIDES,
who, according to the noted ſtory, being aſked
by HIERO, <hi>What God was?</hi> deſired a day to
think of it, and then two days more; and after
that manner continually prolonged the term, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever bringing in his definition or deſcription?
Could you even blame me, if I had anſwered at
firſt, <hi>that I did not know,</hi> and was ſenſible that
this ſubject lay vaſtly beyond the reach of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties?
You might cry out ſceptic and rallier as
much as you pleaſed: but having found, in ſo
many other ſubjects, much more familiar, the
imperfections and even contradictions of human
reaſon, I never ſhould expect any ſucceſs from its
feeble conjectures, in a ſubject, ſo ſublime, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0455900400:38"/>
ſo remote from the ſphere of our obſervation.
When two <hi>ſpecies</hi> of objects have always been
obſerved to be conjoined together, I can <hi>infer,</hi>
by cuſtom, the exiſtence of one, where-ever I
<hi>ſee</hi> the exiſtence of the other: and this I call an
argument from experience. But how this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can have place, where the objects, as in the
preſent caſe, are ſingle, individual, without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,
or ſpecific reſemblance, may be difficult to
explain. And will any man tell me with a ſerious
countenance, that an orderly univerſe muſt ariſe
from ſome thought and art, like the human; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have experience of it? To aſcertain
this reaſoning, it were requiſite, that we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the origin of worlds; and it is not
ſufficient ſurely, that we have ſeen ſhips and cities
ariſe from human art and contrivance.........</p>
               <p>PHILO was proceeding in this vehement man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
ſomewhat between jeſt and earneſt, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to me; when he obſerved ſome ſigns of
impatience in CLEANTHES, and then immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtopped ſhort. What I had to ſuggeſt, ſaid
CLEANTHES, is only that you would not abuſe
terms, or make uſe of popular expreſſions to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
philoſophical reaſonings. You know, that
the vulgar often diſtinguiſh reaſon from experience,
even where the queſtion relates only to matter of
fact and exiſtence; though it is found, where
that <hi>reaſon</hi> is properly analyzed, that it is nothing
but a ſpecies of experience. To prove by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
the origin of the univerſe from mind is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0455900400:39"/>
not more contrary to common ſpeech than to
prove the motion of the earth from the ſame
principle. And a caviller might raiſe all the ſame
objections to the COPERNICAN ſyſtem, which
you have urged againſt my reaſonings. Have
you other earths, might he ſay, which you have
ſeen to move? Have.</p>
               <p>Yes! cried PHILO, interrupting him, we have
other earths. Is not the moon another earth,
which we ſee to turn round its centre? Is not
Venus another earth, where we obſerve the ſame
phenomenon? Are not the revolutions of the
ſun alſo a confirmation, from analogy, of the
ſame theory? All the planets, are they not
earths, which revolve about the ſun? Are not
the ſatellites moons, which move round Jupiter
and Saturn, and along with theſe primary planets,
round the ſun? Theſe analogies and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,
with others, which I have not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are the ſole proofs of the COPERNICAN ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem:
and to you it belongs to conſider, whether
you have any analogies of the ſame kind to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
your theory.</p>
               <p>In reality, CLEANTHES, continued he, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
ſyſtem of aſtronomy is now ſo much recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by all enquirers, and has become ſo eſſential
a part even of our earlieſt education, that we are
not commonly very ſcrupulous in examining the
reaſons, upon which it is founded. It is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a matter of mere curioſity to ſtudy the firſt
writers on that ſubject, who had the full force of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0455900400:40"/>
prejudice to encounter, and were obliged to turn
their arguments on every ſide, in order to render
them popular and convincing. But if we peruſe
GALILAEO's famous Dialogues concerning the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
of the world, we ſhall find, that that great
genius, one of the ſublimeſt that ever exiſted,
firſt bent all his endeavours to prove, that there
was no foundation for the diſtinction commonly
made between elementary and celeſtial ſubſtances.
The ſchools, proceeding from the illuſions of
ſenſe, had carried this diſtinction very far; and
had eſtabliſhed the latter ſubſtances to be ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
incorruptible, unalterable, impaſſable; and
had aſſigned all the oppoſite qualities to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
But GALILAEO, beginning with the moon,
proved its ſimilarity in every particular to the
earth; its convex figure, its natural darkneſs
when not illuminated, its denſity, its diſtinction
into ſolid and liquid, the variations of its phaſes,
the mutual illuminations of the earth and moon,
their mutual eclipſes, the inequalities of the lunar
ſurface, &amp;c. After many inſtances of this kind,
with regard to all the planets, men plainly ſaw,
that theſe bodies became proper objects of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
and that the ſimilarity of their nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
us to extend the ſame arguments and phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
from one to the other.</p>
               <p>In this cautious proceeding of the aſtronomers,
you may read your own condemnation, CLEAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THES;
or rather may ſee, that the ſubject in which
you are engaged exceeds all human reaſon and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0455900400:41"/>
enquiry. Can you pretend to ſhow any ſuch ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milarity
between the fabric of a houſe, and the
generation of a univerſe? Have you ever ſeen
Nature in any ſuch ſituation as reſembles the firſt
arrangement of the elements? Have worlds ever
been formed under your eye? and have you had
leiſure to obſerve the whole progreſs of the pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,
from the firſt appearance of order to its
final conſummation? If you have, then cite
your experience, and deliver your theory.</p>

               <p>HOW the moſt abſurd argument, replied
CLEANTHES, in the hands of a man of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and invention, may acquire an air of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity!
Are you not aware, PHILO, that it became
neceſſary for COPERNICUS and his firſt diſciples
to prove the ſimilarity of the terreſtrial and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
matter; becauſe ſeveral philoſophers, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by old ſyſtems, and ſupported by ſome ſenſible
appearances, had denied this ſimilarity? But that
it is by no means neceſſary, that Theiſts ſhould
prove the ſimilarity of the works of Nature to
thoſe of Art; becauſe this ſimilarity is ſelf-evident
and undeniable? The ſame matter, a like form:
what more is requiſite to ſhow an analogy between
their cauſes, and to aſcertain the origin of all
things from a divine purpoſe and intention? Your
objections, I muſt freely tell you, are no better
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0455900400:42"/>
than the abſtruſe cavils of thoſe philoſophers,<note place="margin">Part III.</note> who
denied motion; and ought to be refuted in the
ſame manner, by illuſtrations, examples, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
rather than by ſerious argument and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, therefore, that an articulate voice
were heard in the clouds, much louder and more
melodious than any which human art could ever
reach: Suppoſe, that this voice were extended in
the ſame inſtant over all nations, and ſpoke to
each nation in its own language and dialect: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that the words delivered not only contain a
juſt ſenſe and meaning, but convey ſome inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
altogether worthy of a benevolent being, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to mankind: could you poſſibly heſitate a
moment concerning the cauſe of this voice? and
muſt you not inſtantly aſcribe it to ſome deſign or
purpoſe? Yet I cannot ſee but all the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
(if they merit that appellation) which lie
againſt the ſyſtem of Theiſm, may alſo be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
againſt this inference.</p>
               <p>Might you not ſay, that all concluſions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fact were founded on experience: that when
we hear an articulate voice in the dark, and
thence infer a man, it is only the reſemblance of
the effects, which leads us to conclude that there
is a like reſemblance in the cauſe: but that this
extraordinary voice, by its loudneſs, extent, and
flexibility to all languages, bears ſo little analogy
to any human voice, that we have no reaſon to
ſuppoſe any analogy in their cauſes: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0455900400:43"/>
that a rational, wiſe, coherent ſpeech
proceeded, you knew not whence, from ſome
accidental whiſtling of the winds, not from any
divine reaſon or intelligence? You ſee clearly
your own objections in theſe cavils; and I hope
too, you ſee clearly, that they cannot poſſibly
have more force in the one caſe than in the other.</p>
               <p>But to bring the caſe ſtill nearer the preſent one
of the univerſe, I ſhall make two ſuppoſitions,
which imply not any abſurdity or impoſſibility.
Suppoſe, that there is a natural, univerſal, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
language, common to every individual of
human race, and that books are natural produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which perpetuate themſelves in the ſame
manner with animals and vegetables, by deſcent
and propagation. Several expreſſions of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
contain a univerſal language: all brute ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
have a natural ſpeech, which, however li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
is very intelligible to their own ſpecies.
And as there are infinitely fewer parts and leſs
contrivance in the fineſt compoſition of eloquence,
than in the coarſeſt organized body, the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an <hi>Iliad</hi> or <hi>Aeneid</hi> is an eaſier ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than that of any plant or animal.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, therefore, that you enter into your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
thus peopled by natural volumes, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt refined reaſon and moſt exquiſite
beauty: could you poſſibly open one of them,
and doubt, that its original cauſe bore the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
analogy to mind and intelligence? When it
reaſons and diſcourſes; when it expoſtulates, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0455900400:44"/>
and enforces its views and topics; when it
applies ſometimes to the pure intellect, ſometimes
to the affections; when it collects, diſpoſes, and
adorns every conſideration ſuited to the ſubject:
could you perſiſt in aſſerting, that all this, at the
bottom, had really no meaning, and that the firſt
formation of this volume in the loins of its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
parent proceeded not from thought and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign?
Your obſtinacy, I know, reaches not that
degree of firmneſs: even your ſceptical play and
wantonneſs would be abaſhed at ſo glaring an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity.</p>
               <p>But if there be any difference, PHILO, between
this ſuppoſed caſe and the real one of the univerſe,
it is all to the advantage of the latter. The ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
of an animal affords many ſtronger inſtances
of deſign than the peruſal of LIVY or TACI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS:
and any objection which you ſtart in the
former caſe, by carrying me back to ſo unuſual
and extraordinary a ſcene as the firſt formation
of worlds, the ſame objection has place on the
ſuppoſition of our vegetating library. Chuſe,
then, your party, PHILO, without ambiguity or
evaſion: aſſert either that a rational volume is no
proof of a rational cauſe, or admit of a ſimilar
cauſe to all the works of nature.</p>
               <p>Let me here obſerve too, continued CLEAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THES,
that this religious argument, inſtead of
being weakened by that ſcepticiſm, ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by you, rather acquires force from it,
and becomes more firm and undiſputed. To
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0455900400:45"/>
exclude all argument or reaſoning of every kind
is either affectation or madneſs. The declared
profeſſion of every reaſonable ſceptic is only to
reject abſtruſe, remote and refined arguments;
to adhere to common ſenſe and the plain inſtincts
of nature; and to aſſent, where-ever any reaſons
ſtrike him with ſo full a force, that he cannot,
without the greateſt violence, prevent it. Now
the arguments for Natural Religion are plainly
of this kind; and nothing but the moſt perverſe,
obſtinate metaphyſics can reject them. Conſider,
anatomize the eye: Survey its ſtructure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance;
and tell me, from your own feeling,
if the idea of a contriver does not immediately
flow in upon you with a force like that of ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The moſt obvious concluſion ſurely is in
favour of deſign; and it requires time, reflection
and ſtudy to ſummon up thoſe frivolous, though
abſtruſe objections, which can ſupport Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Who can behold the male and female of
each ſpecies, the correſpondence of their parts
and inſtincts, their paſſions and whole courſe of
life before and after generation, but muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that the propagation of the ſpecies is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by Nature? Millions and millions of ſuch
inſtances preſent themſelves through every part of
the univerſe; and no language can convey a
more intelligible, irreſiſtible meaning, than the
curious adjuſtment of final cauſes. To what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
therefore, of blind dogmatiſm muſt one
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0455900400:46"/>
have attained, to reject ſuch natural and ſuch
convincing arguments?</p>
               <p>Some beauties in writing we may meet with,
which ſeem contrary to rules, and which gain
the affections, and animate the imagination, in
oppoſition to all the precepts of criticiſm, and to
the authority of the eſtabliſhed maſters of art.
And if the argument for Theiſm be, as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
contradictory to the principles of logic;
its univerſal, its irreſiſtible influence proves clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that there may be arguments of a like irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
nature. Whatever cavils may be urged;
an orderly world, as well as a coherent, articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
ſpeech, will ſtill be received as an inconteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
proof of deſign and intention.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens, I own, that the religious
arguments have not their due influence on an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
ſavage and barbarian; not becauſe they
are obſcure and difficult, but becauſe he never
aſks himſelf any queſtion with regard to them.
Whence ariſes the curious ſtructure of an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal?
From the copulation of its parents. And
theſe whence? From <hi>their</hi> parents? A few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
ſet the objects at ſuch a diſtance, that to
him they are loſt in darkneſs and confuſion; nor
is he actuated by any curioſity to trace them
farther. But this is neither dogmatiſm nor ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm,
but ſtupidity; a ſtate of mind very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from your ſifting, inquiſitive diſpoſition, my
ingenious friend. You can trace cauſes from ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:
You can compare the moſt diſtant and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0455900400:47"/>
remote objects: and your greateſt errors proceed
not from barrenneſs of thought and invention,
but from too luxuriant a fertility, which ſuppreſſes
your natural good ſenſe, by a profuſion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
ſcruples and objections.</p>
               <p>Here I could obſerve, HERMIPPUS, that PHILO
was a little embarraſſed and confounded: But
while he heſitated in delivering an anſwer, luckily
for him, DEMEA broke in upon the diſcourſe,
and ſaved his countenance.</p>
               <p>Your inſtance, CLEANTHES, ſaid he, drawn
from books and language, being familiar, has,
I confeſs, ſo much more force on that account;
but is there not ſome danger too in this very
circumſtance; and may it not render us preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
by making us imagine we comprehend
the Deity, and have ſome adequate idea of his
nature and attributes? When I read a volume,
I enter into the mind and intention of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:
I become him, in a manner, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;
and have an immediate feeling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of thoſe ideas, which revolved in his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
while employed in that compoſition.
But ſo near an approach we never ſurely can
make to the Deity. His ways are not our ways.
His attributes are perfect, but incomprehenſible.
And this volume of Nature contains a great and
inexplicable riddle, more than any intelligible
diſcourſe or reaſoning.</p>
               <p>The ancient PLATONISTS, you know, were
the moſt religious and devout of all the Pagan
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0455900400:48"/>
philoſophers: yet many of them, particularly
PLOTINUS us, expreſsly declare, that intellect or
underſtanding is not to be aſcribed to the Deity,
and that our moſt perfect worſhip of him conſiſts,
not in acts of veneration, reverence, gratitude
or love; but in a certain myſterious ſelf-anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation
or total extinction of all our faculties.
Theſe ideas are, perhaps, too far ſtretched; but
ſtill it muſt be acknowledged, that, by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Deity as ſo intelligible, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and ſo ſimilar to a human mind, we are
guilty of the groſſeſt and moſt narrow partiality,
and make ourſelves the model of the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>ſentiments</hi> of the human mind, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
reſentment, love, friendſhip, approbation,
blame, pity, emulation, envy, have a plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the ſtate and ſituation of man, and
are calculated for preſerving the exiſtence, and
promoting the activity of ſuch a being in ſuch
circumſtances. It ſeems therefore unreaſonable
to transfer ſuch ſentiments to a ſupreme exiſtence,
or to ſuppoſe him actuated by them; and the
phenomena, beſides, of the univerſe will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
us in ſuch a theory. All our <hi>ideas,</hi> derived
from the ſenſes are confeſſedly falſe and illuſive;
and cannot, therefore, be ſuppoſed to have place
in a ſupreme intelligence: And as the ideas of
internal ſentiment, added to thoſe of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſenſes, compoſe the whole furniture of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
underſtanding, we may conclude, that none
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0455900400:49"/>
of the <hi>materials</hi> of thought are in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
ſimilar in the human and in the divine
intelligence. Now as to the <hi>manner</hi> of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
how can we make any compariſon between
them, or ſuppoſe them any wiſe reſembling?
Our thought is fluctuating, uncertain, fleeting,
ſucceſſive, and compounded; and were we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
theſe circumſtances, we abſolutely annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
its eſſence, and it would, in ſuch a caſe, be
an abuſe of terms to apply to it the name of
thought or reaſon. At leaſt, if it appear more
pious and reſpectful (as it really is) ſtill to retain
theſe terms, when we mention the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we ought to acknowledge, that their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in that caſe, is totally incomprehenſible;
and that the infirmities of our nature do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
us to reach any ideas, which in the leaſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond
to the ineffable ſublimity of the divine
attributes.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="part">
               <head>PART IV.</head>
               <p>IT ſeems ſtrange to me, ſaid CLEANTHES,
that you, DEMEA, who are ſo ſincere in the
cauſe of religion, ſhould ſtill maintain the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
incomprehenſible nature of the Deity, and
ſhould inſiſt ſo ſtrenuouſly, that he has no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of likeneſs or reſemblance to human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The Deity, I can readily allow, poſſeſſes
many powers and attributes, of which we can
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0455900400:50"/>
have no comprehenſion:<note place="margin">Part IV.</note> But if our ideas, ſo far
as they go, be not juſt, and adequate, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent
to his real nature, I know not what
there is in this ſubject worth inſiſting on. Is
the name, without any meaning, of ſuch mighty
importance? Or how do you MYSTICS, who
maintain the abſolute incomprehenſibility of the
Deity, differ from Sceptics or Atheiſts, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
that the firſt cauſe of all is unknown and
unintelligible? Their temerity muſt be very
great, if, after rejecting the production by a
mind; I mean, a mind, reſembling the human
(for I know of no other) they pretend to aſſign,
with certainty, any other ſpecific, intelligible
cauſe: And their conſcience muſt be very ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
indeed, if they refuſe to call the univerſal,
unknown cauſe a God or Deity; and to beſtow
on him as many ſublime eulogies and unmeaning
epithets, as you ſhall pleaſe to require of them.</p>
               <p>Who could imagine, replied DEMEA, that
CLEANTHES, the calm, philoſophical CLEAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THES,
would attempt to refute his antagoniſts,
by affixing a nick-name to them; and like the
common bigots and inquiſitors of the age, have
recourſe to invective and declamation, inſtead of
reaſoning? Or does he not perceive, that theſe
topics are eaſily retorted, and that ANTHRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POMORPHITE
is an appellation as invidious,
and implies as dangerous conſequences, as the
epithet of MYSTIC, with which he has honoured
us? In reality, CLEANTHES, conſider what it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0455900400:51"/>
is you aſſert, when you repreſent the Deity as
ſimilar to a human mind and underſtanding.
What is the ſoul of man? A compoſition of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
faculties, paſſions, ſentiments, ideas; uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
indeed, into one ſelf or perſon, but ſtill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
from each other. When it reaſons, the
ideas, which are the parts of its diſcourſe, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range
themſelves in a certain form or order; which
is not preſerved entire for a moment, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
gives place to another arrangement. New
opinions, new paſſions, new affections, new feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
ariſe, which continually diverſify the mental
ſcene, and produce in it the greateſt variety, and
moſt rapid ſucceſſion imaginable. How is this
compatible, with that perfect immutability and
ſimplicity, which all true Theiſts aſcribe to the
Deity? By the ſame act, ſay they, he ſees paſt,
preſent, and future: His love and his hatred, his
mercy and his juſtice, are one individual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
He is entire in every point of ſpace; and
complete in every inſtant of duration. No ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
no change, no acquiſition, no diminution.
What he is implies not in it any ſhadow of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
or diverſity. And what he is, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ever has been, and ever will be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any new judgement, ſentiment, or operation.
He ſtands fixed in one ſimple, perfect ſtate; nor
can you ever ſay, with any propriety, that this act
of his is different from that other, or that this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or idea has been lately formed, and will give
place, by ſucceſſion, to any different judgement or
idea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0455900400:52"/>
I can readily allow, ſaid CLEANTHES, that
thoſe who maintain the perfect ſimplicity of the
Supreme Being, to the extent in which you have
explained it, are complete MYSTICS, and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with all the conſequences which I have drawn
from their opinion. They are, in a word, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEISTS,
without knowing it. For though it be
allowed, that the Deity poſſeſſes attributes, of
which we have no comprehenſion; yet ought we
never to aſcribe to him any attributes, which are
abſolutely incompatible with that intelligent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
eſſential to him. A mind, whoſe acts and
ſentiments and ideas are not diſtinct and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive;
one, that is wholly ſimple, and totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable;
is a mind, which has no thought, no
reaſon, no will, no ſentiment, no love, no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
or in a word, is no mind at all. It is an
abuſe of terms to give it that appellation; and
we may as well ſpeak of limited extenſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
figure, or of number without compoſition.</p>
               <p>Pray conſider, ſaid PHILO, whom you are at
preſent inveighing againſt. You are honouring
with the appellation of <hi>Atheiſt</hi> all the ſound, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
divines almoſt, who have treated of this
ſubject; and you will, at laſt be, yourſelf, found,
according to your reckoning, the only ſound
Theiſt in the world. But if idolaters be Atheiſts,
as, I think, may juſtly be aſſerted, and Chriſtian
Theologians the ſame; what becomes of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
ſo much celebrated, derived from the
univerſal conſent of mankind?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0455900400:53"/>
But becauſe I know you are not much ſwayed
by names and authorities, I ſhall endeavour to
ſhow you, a little more diſtinctly, the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
of that Anthropomorphiſm, which you
have embraced; and ſhall prove, that there is
no ground to ſuppoſe a plan of the world to be
formed in the divine mind, conſiſting of diſtinct
ideas, differently arranged; in the ſame manner
as an architect forms in his head the plan of a
houſe which he intends to execute.</p>
               <p>It is not eaſy, I own, to ſee, what is gained
by this ſuppoſition, whether we judge of the
matter by <hi>Reaſon</hi> or by <hi>Experience.</hi> We are
ſtill obliged to mount higher, in order to find
the cauſe of this cauſe, which you had aſſigned
as ſatisfactory and concluſive.</p>
               <p>If Reaſon (I mean abſtract reaſon, derived from
enquiries <hi>a priori</hi>) be not alike mute with regard
to all queſtions concerning cauſe and effect; this
ſentence at leaſt it will venture to pronounce,
That a mental world, or univerſe of ideas, requires
a cauſe as much, as does a material world, or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe
of objects; and if ſimilar in its arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
muſt require a ſimilar cauſe. For what is
there in this ſubject, which ſhould occaſion a
different concluſion or inference? In an abſtract
view, they are entirely alike; and no difficulty
attends the one ſuppoſition, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both of them.</p>
               <p>Again, when we will needs force <hi>Experience</hi> to
pronounce ſome ſentence, even on theſe ſubjects,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0455900400:54"/>
which lie beyond her ſphere; neither can ſhe
perceive any material difference in this particular,
between theſe two kinds of worlds, but finds
them to be governed by ſimilar principles, and
to depend upon an equal variety of cauſes in their
operations. We have ſpecimens in miniature of
both of them. Our own mind reſembles the one:
A vegetable or animal body the other. Let Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
therefore, judge from theſe ſamples.
Nothing ſeems more delicate with regard to its
cauſes than thought; and as theſe cauſes never
operate in two perſons after the ſame manner,
ſo we never find two perſons, who think ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
alike. Nor indeed does the ſame perſon
think exactly alike at any two different periods of
time. A difference of age, of the diſpoſition of
his body, of weather, of food, of company, of
books, of paſſions; any of theſe particulars, or
others more minute, are ſufficient to alter the
curious machinery of thought, and communicate
to it very different movements and operations.
As far as we can judge, vegetables and animal
bodies are not more delicate in their motions,
nor depend upon a greater variety or more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
adjuſtment of ſprings and principles.</p>
               <p>How therefore ſhall we ſatisfy ourſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the cauſe of that Being, whom you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Author of Nature, or, according to
your ſyſtem of Anthropomorphiſm, the ideal
world, into which you trace the material? Have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0455900400:55"/>
we not the ſame reaſon to trace that ideal world
into another ideal world, or new intelligent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple?
But if we ſtop, and go no farther; why
go ſo far? Why not ſtop at the material world?
How can we ſatisfy ourſelves without going on
<hi>in infinitum?</hi> And after all, what ſatisfaction is
there in that infinite progreſſion? Let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the ſtory of the INDIAN philoſopher and his
elephant. It was never more applicable than to
the preſent ſubject. If the material world reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſimilar ideal world, this ideal world muſt reſt
upon ſome other; and ſo on, without end. It
were better, therefore, never to look beyond the
preſent material world. By ſuppoſing it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the principle of its order within itſelf, we
really aſſert it to be God; and the ſooner we
arrive at that divine Being ſo much the better.
When you go one ſtep beyond the mundane ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem,
you only excite an inquiſitive humour,
which it is impoſſible ever to ſatisfy.</p>
               <p>To ſay, that the different ideas, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the reaſon of the Supreme Being, fall into
order, of themſelves, and by their own nature,
is really to talk without any preciſe meaning.
If it has a meaning, I would fain know, why it
is not as good ſenſe to ſay, that the parts of the
material world fall into order, of themſelves, and
by their own nature. Can the one opinion be
intelligible, while the other is not ſo?</p>
               <p>We have, indeed, experience of ideas, which
fall into order, of themſelves, and without any
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0455900400:56"/>
                  <hi>known</hi> cauſe: But, I am ſure, we have a much
larger experience of matter, which does the
ſame; as in all inſtances of generation and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation,
where the accurate analyſis of the cauſe
exceeds all human comprehenſion. We have
alſo experience of particular ſyſtems of thought
and of matter, which have no order; of the firſt,
in madneſs; of the ſecond, in corruption. Why
then ſhould we think, that order is more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to one than the other? And if it requires a
cauſe in both, what do we gain by your ſyſtem,
in tracing the univerſe of objects into a ſimilar
univerſe of ideas? The firſt ſtep, which we make,
leads us on for ever. It were, therefore, wiſe
in us, to limit all our enquiries to the preſent
world, without looking farther. No ſatisfaction
can ever be attained by theſe ſpeculations, which
ſo far exceed the narrow bounds of human un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>It was uſual with the PERIPATETICS, you
know, CLEANTHES, when the cauſe of any
phenomenon was demanded, to have recourſe
to their <hi>faculties</hi> or <hi>occult qualities,</hi> and to
ſay, for inſtance, that bread nouriſhed by its nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive
faculty, and ſenna purged by its purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
But it has been diſcovered, that this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge
was nothing but the diſguiſe of ignorance;
and that theſe philoſophers, though leſs ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
really ſaid the ſame thing with the ſceptics
or the vulgar, who fairly confeſſed, that they
knew not the cauſe of theſe phenomena. In like
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0455900400:57"/>
manner, when it is aſked, what cauſe produces
order in the ideas of the Supreme Being, can
any other reaſon be aſſigned by you, Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphites,
than that it is a <hi>rational</hi> faculty,
and that ſuch is the nature of the Deity? But
why a ſimilar anſwer will not be equally ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
in accounting for the order of the world,
without having recourſe to any ſuch intelligent
creator, as you inſiſt on, may be difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
It is only to ſay, that <hi>ſuch</hi> is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of material objects, and that they are all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
poſſeſſed of a <hi>faculty</hi> of order and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
Theſe are only more learned and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
ways of confeſſing our ignorance; nor
has the one hypotheſis any real advantage above
the other, except in its greater conformity to
vulgar prejudices.</p>
               <p>You have diſplayed this argument with great
emphaſis, replied CLEANTHES: You ſeem not
ſenſible, how eaſy it is to anſwer it. Even
in common life, if I aſſign a cauſe for any event;
is it any objection, PHILO, that I cannot aſſign
the cauſe of that cauſe, and anſwer every new
queſtion, which may inceſſantly be ſtarted? And
what philoſophers could poſſibly ſubmit to ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid
a rule? philoſophers, who confeſs ultimate
cauſes to be totally unknown, and are ſenſible,
that the moſt refined principles, into which they
trace the phenomena, are ſtill to them as inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
as theſe phenomena themſelves are to the
vulgar. The order and arrangement of nature,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0455900400:58"/>
the curious adjuſtment of final cauſes, the plain
uſe and intention of every part and organ; all
theſe beſpeak in the cleareſt language an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
cauſe or author. The heavens and the
earth join in the ſame teſtimony: The whole
chorus of Nature raiſes one hymn to the praiſes
of its creator: You alone, or almoſt alone, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb
this general harmony. You ſtart abſtruſe
doubts, cavils, and objections: You aſk me,
what is the cauſe of this cauſe? I know not;
I care not; that concerns not me. I have found
a Deity; and here I ſtop my enquiry. Let thoſe
go farther, who are wiſer or more enterpriſing.</p>
               <p>I pretend to be neither, replied PHILO: and
for that very reaſon, I ſhould never perhaps have
attempted to go ſo far; eſpecially when I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that I muſt at laſt be contented to ſit down
with the ſame anſwer, which, without farther
trouble, might have ſatisfied me from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
If I am ſtill to remain in utter ignorance
of cauſes, and can abſolutely give an explication
of nothing, I ſhall never eſteem it any advantage
to ſhove off for a moment a difficulty, which, you
acknowledge, muſt immediately, in its full force,
recur upon me. Naturaliſts indeed very juſtly
explain particular effects by more general cauſes;
though theſe general cauſes themſelves ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the end totally inexplicable: but they
never ſurely thought it ſatisfactory to explain a
particular effect by a particular cauſe, which was
no more to be accounted for than the effect itſelf.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0455900400:59"/>
An ideal ſyſtem, arranged of itſelf, without a
precedent deſign, is not a whit more explicable
than a material one, which attains its order in a
like manner; nor is there any more difficulty in
the latter ſuppoſition than in the former.</p>

If this argument, I ſay, had any force
in former ages; how much greater muſt it have
at preſent; when the bounds of Nature are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
enlarged, and ſuch a magnificent ſcene is
opened to us? It is ſtill more unreaſonable to
form our idea of ſo unlimited a cauſe from our
experience of the narrow productions of human
deſign and invention.</p>
               <p>The diſcoveries by microſcopes, as they open a
new univerſe in miniature, are ſtill objections,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0455900400:61"/>
according to you; arguments, according to me.
The farther we puſh our reſearches of this kind,
we are ſtill led to infer the univerſal cauſe of all to
be vaſtly different from mankind, or from any
object of human experience and obſervation.</p>
               <p>And what ſay you to the diſcoveries in anatomy,
chymiſtry, botany? — Theſe ſurely are no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
replied CLEANTHES: they only diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
new inſtances of art and contrivance. It is
ſtill the image of mind reflected on us from innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
objects. Add, a mind <hi>like the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
ſaid PHILO. I know of no other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
CLEANTHES. And the liker the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
inſiſted PHILO. To be ſure, ſaid CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANTHES.</p>
               <p>Now, CLEANTHES, ſaid PHILO, with an air
of alacrity and triumph, mark the conſequences.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> By this method of reaſoning, you renounce
all claim to infinity in any of the attributes of the
Deity. For as the cauſe ought only to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the effect, and the effect, ſo far as it
falls under our cogniſance, is not infinite; what
pretenſions have we, upon your ſuppoſitions, to
aſcribe that attribute to the divine Being? You
will ſtill inſiſt, that, by removing him ſo much
from all ſimilarity to human creatures, we give
into the moſt arbitrary hypotheſis, and at the
ſame time, weaken all proofs of his exiſtence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have no reaſon, on your theory,
for aſcribing perfection to the Deity, even in his
finite capacity; or for ſuppoſing him free from
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0455900400:62"/>
every error, miſtake, or incoherence in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.
There are many inexplicable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in the works of Nature, which, if we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a perfect author to be proved <hi>a priori,</hi> are
eaſily ſolved, and become only ſeeming difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
from the narrow capacity of man, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
trace infinite relations. But according to your
method of reaſoning, theſe difficulties become all
real; and perhaps will be inſiſted on, as new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of likeneſs to human art and contrivance.
At leaſt, you muſt acknowledge, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for us to tell, from our limited views, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this ſyſtem contains any great faults, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
any conſiderable praiſe, if compared to
other poſſible, and even real ſyſtems. Could a
peaſant, if the AENEID were read to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that poem to be abſolutely faultleſs, or
even aſſign to it its proper rank among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of human wit; he, who had never ſeen
any other production?</p>
               <p>But were this world ever ſo perfect a produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it muſt ſtill remain uncertain, whether all
the excellencies of the work can juſtly be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the workman. If we ſurvey a ſhip, what
an exalted idea muſt we form of the ingenuity of
the carpenter, who framed ſo complicated uſeful
and beautiful a machine? And what ſurpriſe
muſt we feel, when we find him a ſtupid mechanic,
who imitated others, and copied an art, which,
through a long ſucceſſion of ages, after multiplied
trials, miſtakes, corrections, deliberations, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0455900400:63"/>
controverſies, had been gradually improving?
Many worlds might have been botched and bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
throughout an eternity, ere this ſyſtem
was ſtruck out: much labour loſt: many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
trials made: and a ſlow, but continued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
carried on during infinite ages in the
art of world-making. In ſuch ſubjects, who can
determine, where the truth; nay, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
where the probability, lies; amidſt a great
number of hypotheſes which may be propoſed,
and a ſtill greater number, which may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined?</p>
               <p>And what ſhadow of an argument, continued
PHILO, can you produce, from your hypotheſis,
to prove the unity of the Deity? A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men join in building a houſe or ſhip, in
rearing a city, in framing a commonwealth: why
may not ſeveral deities combine in contriving and
framing a world? This is only ſo much greater
ſimilarity to human affairs. By ſharing the work
among ſeveral, we may ſo much farther limit the
attributes of each, and get rid of that extenſive
power and knowledge, which muſt be ſuppoſed in
one deity, and which, according to you, can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſerve to weaken the proof of his exiſtence.
And if ſuch fooliſh, ſuch vicious creatures as man
can yet often unite in framing and executing one
plan; how much more thoſe deities or daemons,
whom we may ſuppoſe ſeveral degrees more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>
               <p>To multiply cauſes, without neceſſity, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0455900400:64"/>
contrary to true philoſophy: but this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
applies not to the preſent caſe. Were one
deity antecedently proved by your theory, who
were poſſeſſed of every attribute, requiſite to the
production of the univerſe; it would be needleſs,
I own (though not abſurd) to ſuppoſe any other
deity exiſtent. But while it is ſtill a queſtion,
Whether all theſe attributes are united in one
ſubject, or diſperſed among ſeveral independent
beings: by what phenomena in nature can we
pretend to decide the controverſy? Where we
ſee a body raiſed in a ſcale, we are ſure that there
is in the oppoſite ſcale, however concealed from
ſight, ſome counterpoiſing weight equal to it:
but it is ſtill allowed to doubt, whether that
weight be an aggregate of ſeveral diſtinct bodies,
or one uniform united maſs. And if the weight
requiſite very much exceeds any thing which we
have ever ſeen conjoined in any ſingle body, the
former ſuppoſition becomes ſtill more probable
and natural. An intelligent being of ſuch vaſt
power and capacity, as is neceſſary to produce the
univerſe, or, to ſpeak in the language of ancient
philoſophy, ſo prodigious an animal, exceeds all
analogy and even comprehenſion.</p>
               <p>But farther, CLEANTHES; men are mortal,
and renew their ſpecies by generation; and this
is common to all living creatures. The two great
ſexes of male and female, ſays MILTON, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the world. Why muſt this circumſtance,
ſo univerſal, ſo eſſential, be excluded from thoſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0455900400:65"/>
numerous and limited deities? Behold then the
theogony of ancient times brought back upon us.</p>
               <p>And why not become a perfect Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phite?
Why not aſſert the deity or deities to be
corporeal, and to have eyes, a noſe, mouth, ears,
&amp;c.? EPICURUS maintained, that no man had
ever ſeen reaſon but in a human figure; therefore
the gods muſt have a human figure. And this
argument, which is deſervedly ſo much ridiculed
by CICERO, becomes, according to you, ſolid
and philoſophical.</p>
               <p>In a word, CLEANTHES, a man, who follows
your hypotheſis, is able, perhaps, to aſſert, or
conjecture, that the univerſe, ſometime, aroſe
from ſomething like deſign: but beyond that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
he cannot aſcertain one ſingle circumſtance,
and is left afterwards to fix every point of his the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,
by the utmoſt licence of fancy and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.
This world, for aught he knows, is very
faulty and imperfect, compared to a ſuperior
ſtandard; and was only the firſt rude eſſay of
ſome infant deity, who afterwards abandoned it,
aſhamed of his lame performance: it is the work
only of ſome dependent, inferior deity; and is
the object of deriſion to his ſuperiors: it is the
production of old age and dotage in ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated
deity; and ever ſince his death, has
run on at adventures, from the firſt impulſe and
active force, which it received from him. You
juſtly give ſigns of horror, DEMEA, at theſe
ſtrange ſuppoſitions: but theſe, and a thouſand
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0455900400:66"/>
more of the ſame kind, are CLEANTHES's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
not mine. From the moment the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of the Deity are ſuppoſed finite, all theſe
have place. And I cannot, for my part, think,
that ſo wild and unſettled a ſyſtem of theology is,
in any reſpect, preferable to none at all.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſuppoſitions I abſolutely diſown, cried
CLEANTHES: they ſtrike me, however, with no
horror; eſpecially, when propoſed in that ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
way, in which they drop from you. On
the contrary, they give me pleaſure, when I ſee,
that, by the utmoſt indulgence of your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you never get rid of the hypotheſis of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in the univerſe; but are obliged, at every
turn, to have recourſe to it. To this conceſſion I
adhere ſteadily; and this I regard as a ſufficient
foundation for religion.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="part">
               <head>PART VI.</head>
               <p>IT muſt be a ſlight fabric, indeed, ſaid DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEA,
which can be erected on ſo tottering a
foundation. While we are uncertain, whether
there is one deity or many; whether the deity
or deities, to whom we owe our exiſtence, be
perfect or imperfect, ſubordinate or ſupreme,
dead or alive; what truſt or confidence can we
repoſe in them? What devotion or worſhip ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to them? What veneration or obedience
pay them? To all the purpoſes of life, the theory
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0455900400:67"/>
of religion becomes altogether uſeleſs:<note place="margin">Part VI.</note> and even
with regard to ſpeculative conſequences, its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
according to you, muſt render it total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
precarious and unſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>To render it ſtill more unſatisfactory, ſaid
PHILO, there occurs to me another hypotheſis,
which muſt acquire an air of probability from the
method of reaſoning ſo much inſiſted on by CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANTHES.
That like effects ariſe from like
cauſes: this principle he ſuppoſes the foundation
of all religion. But there is another principle of
the ſame kind, no leſs certain, and derived from
the ſame ſource of experience; That where ſeveral
known circumſtances are obſerved to be ſimilar,
the unknown will alſo be found ſimilar. Thus,
if we ſee the limbs of a human body, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that it is alſo attended with a human head,
though hid from us. Thus, if we ſee, through a
chink in a wall, a ſmall part of the ſun, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that, were the wall removed, we ſhould ſee
the whole body. In ſhort, this method of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is ſo obvious and familiar, that no ſcruple can
ever be made with regard to its ſolidity.</p>
               <p>Now if we ſurvey the univerſe, ſo far as it falls
under our knowledge, it bears a great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to an animal or organized body, and ſeems
actuated with a like principle of life and motion.
A continual circulation of matter in it produces
no diſorder: a continual waſte in every part is
inceſſantly repaired: the cloſeſt ſympathy is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
throughout the entire ſyſtem: and each
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0455900400:68"/>
part or member, in performing its proper offices,
operates both to its own preſervation and to that
of the whole. The world, therefore, I infer, is
an animal, and the Deity is the SOUL of the
world, actuating it, and actuated by it.</p>
               <p>You have too much learning, CLEANTHES,
to be at all ſurpriſed at this opinion, which, you
know, was maintained by almoſt all the Theiſts
of antiquity, and chiefly prevails in their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and reaſonings. For though ſometimes the
ancient philoſophers reaſon from final cauſes, as
if they thought the world the workmanſhip of
God; yet it appears rather their favorite notion
to conſider it as his body, whoſe organization
renders it ſubſervient to him. And it muſt be
confeſſed, that as the univerſe reſembles more a
human body than it does the works of human art
and contrivance; if our limited analogy could
ever, with any propriety, be extended to the
whole of nature, the inference ſeems juſter in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the ancient than the modern theory.</p>
               <p>There are many other advantages too, in the
former theory, which recommended it to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Theologians. Nothing more repugnant to all
their notions, becauſe nothing more repugnant to
common experience, than mind without body; a
mere ſpiritual ſubſtance, which fell not under
their ſenſes nor comprehenſion, and of which they
had not obſerved one ſingle inſtance throughout
all nature. Mind and body they knew, becauſe
they felt both: an order, arrangement, organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,
or internal machinery in both they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0455900400:69"/>
knew, after the ſame manner: and it could
not but ſeem reaſonable to transfer this experience
to the univerſe, and to ſuppoſe the divine mind
and body to be alſo coeval, and to have, both of
them, order and arrangement naturally inherent
in them, and inſeparable from them.</p>
               <p>Here therefore is a new ſpecies of <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphiſm,</hi>
CLEANTHES, on which you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate;
and a theory which ſeems not liable to
any conſiderable difficulties. You are too much
ſuperior ſurely to <hi>ſyſtematical prejudices,</hi> to find
any more difficulty in ſuppoſing an animal body
to be, originally, of itſelf, or from unknown
cauſes, poſſeſſed of order and organization, than
in ſuppoſing a ſimilar order to belong to mind.
But the <hi>vulgar prejudice,</hi> that body and mind
ought always to accompany each other, ought
not, one ſhould think, to be entirely neglected;
ſince it is founded on <hi>vulgar experience,</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guide which you profeſs to follow in all theſe
theological enquiries. And if you aſſert, that
our limited experience is an unequal ſtandard, by
which to judge of the unlimited extent of nature;
you entirely abandon your own hypotheſis, and
muſt thenceforward adopt our Myſticiſm, as you
call it, and admit of the abſolute incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>This theory, I own, replied CLEANTHES, has
never before occurred to me, though a pretty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
one; and I cannot readily, upon ſo ſhort an
examination and reflection, deliver any opinion
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0455900400:70"/>
with regard to it. You are very ſcrupulous,
indeed, ſaid PHILO; were I to examine any ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
of yours, I ſhould not have acted with half
that caution and reſerve, in ſtarting objections
and difficulties to it. However, if any thing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to you, you will oblige us by propoſing it.</p>
               <p>Why then, replied CLEANTHES, it ſeems to
me, that, though the world does, in many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
reſemble an animal body; yet is the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
alſo defective in many circumſtances, the
moſt material: no organs of ſenſe; no ſeat of
thought or reaſon; no one preciſe origin of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and action. In ſhort, it ſeems to bear a
ſtronger reſemblance to a vegetable than to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal,
and your inference would be ſo far incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
in favour of the ſoul of the world.</p>
               <p>But in the next place, your theory ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the eternity of the world; and that is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
which, I think, can be refuted by the
ſtrongeſt reaſons and probabilities. I ſhall ſuggeſt
an argument to this purpoſe, which, I believe,
has not been inſiſted on by any writer. Thoſe,
who reaſon from the late origin of arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
though their inference wants not force,
may perhaps be refuted by conſiderations, derived
from the nature of human ſociety, which is in
continual revolution, between ignorance and
knowledge, liberty and ſlavery, riches and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
ſo that it is impoſſible for us, from our limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
experience, to foretell with aſſurance what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
may or may not be expected. Ancient
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0455900400:71"/>
learning and hiſtory ſeem to have been in great
danger of entirely periſhing after the inundation
of the barbarous nations; and had theſe convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
continued a little longer, or been a little more
violent, we ſhould not probably have now known
what paſſed in the world a few centuries before
us. Nay, were it not for the ſuperſtition of the
Popes, who preſerved a little jargon of LATIN,
in order to ſupport the appearance of an ancient
and univerſal church, that tongue muſt have been
utterly loſt: in which caſe, the Weſtern world,
being totally barbarous, would not have been in
a fit diſpoſition for receiving the GREEK language
and learning, which was conveyed to them after
the ſacking of CONSTANTINOPLE. When learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and books had been extinguiſhed, even the
mechanical arts would have fallen conſiderably to
decay; and it is eaſily imagined, that fable or
tradition might aſcribe to them a much later ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
than the true one. This vulgar argument,
therefore, againſt the eternity of the world, ſeems
a little precarious.</p>
               <p>But here appears to be the foundation of a
better argument. LUCULLUS was the firſt that
brought cherry-trees from ASIA to EUROPE;
though that tree thrives ſo well in many EU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROPEAN
climates, that it grows in the woods
without any culture. Is it poſſible, that, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a whole eternity, no EUROPEAN had ever
paſſed into ASIA, and thought of tranſplanting
ſo delicious a fruit into his own country? Or if
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0455900400:72"/>
the tree was once tranſplanted and propagated,
how could it ever afterwards periſh? Empires may
riſe and fall; liberty and ſlavery ſucceed alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately;
ignorance and knowledge give place to
each other; but the cherry-tree will ſtill remain
in the woods of GREECE, SPAIN and ITALY,
and will never be affected by the revolutions of
human ſociety.</p>
               <p>It is not two thouſand years ſince vines were
tranſplanted into FRANCE; though there is no
climate in the world more favourable to them.
It is not three centuries ſince horſes, cows, ſheep,
ſwine, dogs, corn were known in AMERICA. Is
it poſſible, that, during the revolutions of a whole
eternity, there never aroſe a COLUMBUS, who
might open the communication between EUROPE
and that continent? We may as well imagine,
that all men would wear ſtockings for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years, and never have the ſenſe to think of
garters to tie them. All theſe ſeem convincing
proofs of the youth, or rather infancy of the
world; as being founded on the operation of
principles more conſtant and ſteady, than thoſe
by which human ſociety is governed and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Nothing leſs than a total convulſion of the
elements will ever deſtroy all the EUROPEAN
animals and vegetables, which are now to be
found in the Weſtern world.</p>
               <p>And what argument have you againſt ſuch
convulſions? replied PHILO. Strong and almoſt
inconteſtable proofs may be traced over the whole
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0455900400:73"/>
earth, that every part of this globe has continued
for many ages entirely covered with water. And
though order were ſuppoſed inſeparable from
matter, and inherent in it; yet may matter be
ſuſceptible of many and great revolutions, through
the endleſs periods of eternal duration. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant
changes, to which every part of it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
ſeem to intimate ſome ſuch general tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſormations;
though at the ſame time, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
that all the changes and corruptions,
of which we have ever had experience, are but
paſſages from one ſtate of order to another; nor
can matter ever reſt in total deformity and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
What we ſee in the parts, we may infer
in the whole; at leaſt, that is the method of
reaſoning, on which you reſt your whole theory.
And were I obliged to defend any particular ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
of this nature (which I never willingly ſhould
do) I eſteem none more plauſible, than that
which aſcribes an eternal, inherent principle of
order to the world; though attended with great
and continual revolutions and alterations. This
at once ſolves all difficulties; and if the ſolution,
by being ſo general, is not entirely complete and
ſatisfactory, it is, at leaſt, a theory, that we muſt,
ſooner or later, have recourſe to, whatever ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
we embrace. How could things have been
as they are, were there not an original, inherent
principle of order ſomewhere, in thought or in
matter? And it is very indifferent to which of
theſe we give the preference. Chance has no
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0455900400:74"/>
place, on any hypotheſis, ſceptical or religious.
Every thing is ſurely governed by ſteady, invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
laws. And were the inmoſt eſſence of
things laid open to us, we ſhould then diſcover
a ſcene, of which, at preſent, we can have no
idea. Inſtead of admiring the order of natural
beings, we ſhould clearly ſee, that it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impoſſible for them, in the ſmalleſt article,
ever to admit of any other diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>Were any one inclined to revive the ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Theology, which maintained, as we learn from
Heſiod, that this globe was governed by 30,000
deities, who aroſe from the unknown powers of
nature: you would naturally object, CLEAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THES,
that nothing is gained by this hypotheſis;
and that it is as eaſy to ſuppoſe all men and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
beings more numerous, but leſs perfect,
to have ſprung immediately from a like origin.
Puſh the ſame inference a ſtep farther; and you
will find a numerous ſociety of deities as expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
as one univerſal deity, who poſſeſſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himſelf, the powers and perfections of the
whole ſociety. All theſe ſyſtems, then, of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm,
Polytheiſm, and Theiſm, you muſt allow,
on your principles, to be on a like footing, and
that no one of them has any advantages over the
others. You may thence learn the fallacy of
your principles.</p>

               <p>BUT here,<note place="margin">Part VII.</note> continued PHILO, in examining
the ancient ſyſtem of the ſoul of the world, there
ſtrikes me, all on a ſudden, a new idea, which,
if juſt, muſt go near to ſubvert all your reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and deſtroy even your firſt inferences, on
which you repoſe ſuch confidence. If the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
bears a greater likeneſs to animal bodies
and to vegetables, than to the works of human
art, it is more probable, that its cauſe reſembles
the cauſe of the former than that of the latter,
and its origin ought rather to be aſcribed to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
or vegetation than to reaſon or deſign.
Your concluſion, even according to your own
principles, is therefore lame and defective.</p>
               <p>Pray open up this argument a little farther,
ſaid DEMEA. For I do not rightly apprehend it,
in that conciſe manner, in which you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
it.</p>
               <p>Our friend CLEANTHES, replied PHILO,
as you have heard, aſſerts, that ſince no queſtion
of fact can be proved otherwiſe than by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the exiſtence of a Deity admits not of proof
from any other medium. The world, ſays he,
reſembles the works of human contrivance:
Therefore its cauſe muſt alſo reſemble that of the
other. Here we may remark, that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one very ſmall part of nature, to wit
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0455900400:76"/>
man, upon another very ſmall part, to wit that
inanimate matter lying within his reach, is the
rule, by which CLEANTHES judges of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
of the whole; and he meaſures objects, ſo
widely diſproportioned, by the ſame individual
ſtandard. But to wave all objections drawn from
this topic; I affirm, that there are other parts
of the univerſe (beſides the machines of human
invention) which bear ſtill a greater reſemblance
to the fabric of the world, and which therefore
afford a better conjecture concerning the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
origin of this ſyſtem. Theſe parts are animals
and vegetables. The world plainly reſembles
more an animal or a vegetable, than it does a
watch or a knitting-loom. Its cauſe, therefore,
it is more probable, reſembles the cauſe of the
former. The cauſe of the former is generation
or vegetation. The cauſe, therefore, of the
world, we may infer to be ſomething ſimilar or
analagous to generation or vegetation.</p>
               <p>But how is it conceivable, ſaid DEMEA, that
the world can ariſe from any thing ſimilar to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation
or generation?</p>
               <p>Very eaſily, replied PHILO. In like manner
as a tree ſheds its ſeed into the neighbouring
fields, and produces other trees; ſo the great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,
the world, or this planetary ſyſtem, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
within itſelf certain ſeeds, which, being
ſcattered into the ſurrounding chaos, vegetate
into new worlds. A comet, for inſtance, is the
ſeed of a world; and after it has been fully
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0455900400:77"/>
ripened, by paſſing from ſun to ſun, and ſtar to
ſtar, it is at laſt toſt into the unformed elements,
which every where ſurround this univerſe, and
immedialy ſprouts up into a new ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>Or if, for the ſake of variety (for I ſee no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantage) we ſhould ſuppoſe this world to
be an animal; a comet is the egg of this animal;
and in like manner as an oſtrich lays its egg in
the ſand, which, without any farther care, hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the egg, and produces a new animal; ſo.......I
underſtand you, ſays DEMEA: But what wild,
arbitrary ſuppoſitions are theſe? What <hi>data</hi>
have you for ſuch extraordinary concluſions? And
is the ſlight, imaginary reſemblance of the world
to a vegetable or an animal ſufficient to eſtabliſh
the ſame inference with regard to both? Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which are in general ſo widely different;
ought they to be a ſtandard for each other?</p>
               <p>Right, cries PHILO: This is the topic on which
I have all along inſiſted. I have ſtill aſſerted, that
we have no <hi>data</hi> to eſtabliſh any ſyſtem of coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogony.
Our experience, ſo imperfect in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſo limited both in extent and duration,
can afford us no probable conjecture concerning
the whole of things. But if we muſt needs fix
on ſome hypotheſis; by what rule, pray, ought
we to determine our choice? Is there any other
rule than the greater ſimilarity of the objects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared?
And does not a plant or an animal, which
ſprings from vegetation or generation, bear a
ſtronger reſemblance to the world, than does
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0455900400:78"/>
any artificial machine, which ariſes from reaſon
and deſign?</p>
               <p>But what is this vegetation and generation of
which you talk, ſaid DEMEA? Can you explain
their operations, and anatomize that fine internal
ſtructure, on which they depend?</p>
               <p>As much, at leaſt, replied PHILO, as CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANTHES
can explain the operations of reaſon,
or anatomize that internal ſtructure, on which <hi>it</hi>
depends. But without any ſuch elaborate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions,
when I ſee an animal, I infer, that it
ſprang from generation; and that with as great
certainty as you conclude a houſe to have been
reared by deſign. Theſe words, <hi>generation,
reaſon,</hi> mark only certain powers and energies
in nature, whoſe effects are known, but whoſe
eſſence is incomprehenſible; and one of theſe
principles, more than the other, has no privilege
for being made a ſtandard to the whole of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>In reality, DEMEA, it may reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that the larger the views are which we
take of things, the better will they conduct us
in our concluſions concerning ſuch extraordinary
and ſuch magnificent ſubjects. In this little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the world alone, there are four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<hi>Reaſon, Inſtinct, Generation, Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which are ſimilar to each other, and are
the cauſes of ſimilar effects. What a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of other principles may we naturally ſuppoſe
in the immenſe extent and variety of the univerſe,
could we travel from planet to planet and from
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0455900400:79"/>
ſyſtem to ſyſtem, in order to examine each part
of this mighty fabric? Any one of theſe four
principles above mentioned (and a hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which lie open to our conjecture) may
afford us a theory, by which to judge of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin
of the world; and it is a palpable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
partiality, to confine our view entirely
to that principle, by which our own minds ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
Were this principle more intelligible on
that account, ſuch a partiality might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
excuſeable: But reaſon, in its internal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric
and ſtructure, is really as little known to us
as inſtinct or vegetation; and perhaps even that
vague, undeterminate word, <hi>Nature,</hi> to which
the vulgar refer every thing, is not at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
more inexplicable. The effects of theſe
principles are all known to us from experience:
But the principles themſelves, and their manner
of operation are totally unknown: Not is it leſs
intelligible, or leſs conformable to experience to
ſay, that the world aroſe by vegetation from a
ſeed ſhed by another world, than to ſay that it
aroſe from a divine reaſon or contrivance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſenſe in which CLEANTHES un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
it.</p>
               <p>But methinks, ſaid DEMEA, if the world had
a vegetative quality, and could ſow the ſeeds of
new worlds into the infinite chaos, this power
would be ſtill an additional argument for deſign
in its author. For whence could ariſe ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
a faculty but from deſign? Or how can
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0455900400:80"/>
order ſpring from any thing, which perceives not
that order which it beſtows?</p>
               <p>You need only look around you, replied
PHILO, to ſatisfy yourſelf with regard to this
queſtion. A tree beſtows order and organization
on that tree, which ſprings from it, without
knowing the order: an animal, in the ſame
manner, on its offspring: a bird, on its neſt:
and inſtances of this kind are even more frequent
in the world, than thoſe of order, which ariſe
from reaſon and contrivance. To ſay that all
this order in animals and vegetables proceeds ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
from deſign, is begging the queſtion;
nor can that great point be aſcertained otherwiſe
than by proving <hi>a priori,</hi> both that order is,
from its nature, inſeparably attached to thought,
and that it can never, of itſelf, or from original
unknown principles, belong to matter.</p>
               <p>But farther, DEMEA; this objection, which
you urge, can never be made uſe of by CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANTHES,
without renouncing a defence, which
he has already made againſt one of my objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
When I enquired concerning the cauſe
of that ſupreme reaſon and intelligence, into
which he reſolves every thing; he told me, that
the impoſſibility of ſatisfying ſuch enquiries could
never be admitted as an objection in any ſpecies
of philoſophy. <hi>We muſt ſtop ſomewhere,</hi> ſays
he; <hi>nor is it ever within the reach of human
capacity to explain ultimate cauſes, or ſhow
the laſt connections of any objects. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0455900400:81"/>
if the ſteps, ſo far as we go, are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by experience and obſervation.</hi> Now,
that vegetation and generation, as well as reaſon,
are experienced to be principles of order in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is undeniable. If I reſt my ſyſtem of coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogony
on the former, preferably to the latter,
'tis at my choice. The matter ſeems entirely
arbitrary. And when CLEANTHES aſks me
what is the cauſe of my great vegetative or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
faculty, I am equally intitled to aſk him
the cauſe of his great reaſoning principle. Theſe
queſtions we have agreed to forbear on both
ſides; and it is chiefly his intereſt on the preſent
occaſion to ſtick to this agreement. Judging by
our limited and imperfect experience, generation
has ſome privileges above reaſon: For we ſee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day the latter ariſe from the former, never
the former from the latter.</p>
               <p>Compare, I beſeech you, the conſequences on
both ſides. The world, ſay I, reſembles an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
therefore it is an animal, therefore it aroſe
from generation. The ſteps, I confeſs, are wide;
yet there is ſome ſmall appearance of analogy in
each ſtep. The world, ſays CLEANTHES, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
a machine, therefore it is a machine,
therefore it aroſe from deſign. The ſteps here are
equally wide, and the analogy leſs ſtriking. And
if he pretends to carry on <hi>my</hi> hypotheſis a ſtep
farther, and to infer deſign or reaſon from the
great principle of generation, on which I inſiſt;
I may, with better authority, uſe the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0455900400:82"/>
to puſh farther his hypotheſis, and infer a
divine generation or theogony from his principle
of reaſon. I have at leaſt ſome faint ſhadow of
experience, which is the utmoſt, that can ever be
attained in the preſent ſubject. Reaſon, in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
inſtances, is obſerved to ariſe from the
principle of generation, and never to ariſe from
any other principle.</p>
               <p>HESIOD, and all the ancient Mythologiſts,
were ſo ſtruck with this analogy, that they uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
explained the origin of nature from an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
birth, and copulation. PLATO too, ſo far
as he is intelligible, ſeems to have adopted ſome
ſuch notion in his TIMAEUS.</p>
               <p>The BRAMINS aſſert, that the world aroſe
from an inſinite ſpider, who ſpun this whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
maſs from his bowels, and annihilates af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the whole or any part of it, by abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it again, and reſolving it into his own eſſence.
Here is a ſpecies of coſmogony, which appears to
us ridiculous; becauſe a ſpider is a little contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
animal, whoſe operations we are never like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take for a model of the whole univerſe.
But ſtill here is a new ſpecies of analogy, even in
our globe. And were there a planet, wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by ſpiders, (which is very poſſible) this
inference would there appear as natural and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable
as that which in our planet aſcribes the
origin of all things to deſign and intelligence, as
explained by CLEANTHES. Why an orderly ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
may not be ſpun from the belly as well as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0455900400:83"/>
from the brain, it will be difficult for him to give
a ſatisfactory reaſon.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, PHILO, replied CLEANTHES,
that, of all men living, the taſk which you have
undertaken, of raiſing doubts and objections,
ſuits you beſt, and ſeems, in a manner, natural
and unavoidable to you. So great is your fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of invention, that I am not aſhamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
myſelf unable, on a ſudden, to ſolve regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
ſuch out-of-the-way difficulties as you inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
ſtart upon me: though I clearly ſee, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
their fallacy and error. And I queſtion
not, but you are yourſelf, at preſent, in the ſame
caſe, and have not the ſolution ſo ready as the
objection; while you muſt be ſenſible, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe and reaſon is entirely againſt you, and
that ſuch whimſies as you have delivered, may
puzzle, but never can convince us.</p>

               <p>WHAT you aſcribe to the fertility of my inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
replied PHILO, is entirely owing to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the ſubject. In ſubjects, adapted to the

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0455900400:84"/>
views may preſerve a kind of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
analogy;<note place="margin">Part VIII.</note> and invention has here full ſcope to
exert itſelf. Without any great effort of thought,
I believe that I could, in an inſtant, propoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſyſtems of coſmogony, which would have
ſome faint appearance of truth; though it is a
thouſand, a million to one, if either yours or any
one of mine be the true ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>For inſtance; what if I ſhould revive the old
EPICUREAN hypotheſis? This is commonly,
and I believe, juſtly, eſteemed the moſt abſurd
ſyſtem, that has yet been propoſed; yet, I know
not, whether, with a few alterations, it might
not be brought to bear a faint appearance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.
Inſtead of ſuppoſing matter infinite, as
EPICURUS did; let us ſuppoſe it finite. A finite
number of particles is only ſuſceptible of finite
tranſpoſitions: and it muſt happen, in an eternal
duration, that every poſſible order or poſition
muſt be tried an infinite number of times. This
world, therefore, with all its events, even the
moſt minute, has before been produced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and will again be produced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
without any bounds and limitations. No
one, who has a conception of the powers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
in compariſon of finite, will ever ſcruple
this determination.</p>
               <p>But this ſuppoſes, ſaid DEMEA, that matter
can acquire motion, without any voluntary agent
or firſt mover.</p>
               <p>And where is the difficulty, replied PHILO, of
that ſuppoſition? Every event, before experience,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0455900400:85"/>
is equally difficult and incomprehenſible; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
event, after experience, is equally eaſy and
intelligible. Motion, in many inſtances, from gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
from elaſticity, from electricity, begins in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
without any known voluntary agent; and to
ſuppoſe always, in theſe caſes, an unknown vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
agent, is mere hypotheſis; and hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
attended with no advantages. The beginning
of motion in matter itſelf is as conceivable <hi>a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori</hi>
as its communication from mind and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>Beſides; why may not motion have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by impulſe through all eternity, and the
ſame ſtock of it, or nearly the ſame, be ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in the univerſe? As much as is loſt by the
compoſition of motion, as much is gained by its
reſolution. And whatever the cauſes are, the fact
is certain, that matter is, and always has been in
continual agitation, as far as human experience
or tradition reaches. There is not probably, at
preſent, in the whole univerſe, one particle of
matter at abſolute reſt.</p>
               <p>And this very conſideration too, continued
PHILO, which we have ſtumbled on in the courſe
of the argument, ſuggeſts a new hypotheſis of
coſmogony, that is not abſolutely abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.
Is there a ſyſtem, an order, an oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of things, by which matter can preſerve
that perpetual agitation, which ſeems eſſential to
it, and yet maintain a conſtancy in the forms,
which it produces? There certainly is ſuch an
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0455900400:86"/>
oeconomy: for this is actually the caſe with the
preſent world. The continual motion of matter,
therefore, in leſs than infinite tranſpoſitions, muſt
produce this oeconomy or order; and by its very
nature, that order, when once eſtabliſhed, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
itſelf, for many ages, if not to eternity.
But where-ever matter is ſo poized, arranged, and
adjuſted as to continue in perpetual motion, and
yet preſerve a conſtancy in the forms, its ſituation
muſt, of neceſſity, have all the ſame appearance
of art and contrivance, which we obſerve at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
All the parts of each form muſt have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to each other, and to the whole: and the
whole itſelf muſt have a relation to the other parts
of the univerſe; to the element, in which the
form ſubſiſts; to the materials, with which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
its waſte and decay; and to every other
form, which is hoſtile or friendly. A defect in
any of theſe particulars deſtroys the form; and
the matter, of which it is compoſed, is again ſet
looſe, and is thrown into irregular motions and
fermentations, till it unite itſelf to ſome other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
form. If no ſuch form be prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, and if there be a great quantity of this
corrupted matter in the univerſe, the univerſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is entirely diſordered; whether it be the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
embryo of a world in its firſt beginnings, that
is thus deſtroyed, or the rotten carcaſs of one,
languiſhing in old age and infirmity. In either
caſe, a chaos enſues; till finite, though innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
revolutions produce at laſt ſome forms,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0455900400:87"/>
whoſe parts and organs are ſo adjuſted as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the forms amidſt a continued ſucceſſion of
matter.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, (for we ſhall endeavour to vary the
expreſſion) that matter were thrown into any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
by a blind, unguided force; it is evident
that this firſt poſition muſt in all probability be
the moſt confuſed and moſt diſorderly imaginable,
without any reſemblance to thoſe works of human
contrivance, which, along with a ſymmetry of
parts, diſcover an adjuſtment of means to ends
and a tendency to ſelf-preſervation. If the actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
force ceaſe after this operation, matter muſt
remain for ever in diſorder, and continue an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
chaos, without any proportion or activity.
But ſuppoſe, that the actuating force, whatever it
be, ſtill continues in matter, this firſt poſition
will immediately give place to a ſecond, which
will likewiſe in all probability be as diſorderly as
the firſt, and ſo on, through many ſucceſſions of
changes and revolutions. No particular order or
poſition ever continues a moment unaltered. The
original force, ſtill remaining in activity, gives a
perpetual reſtleſſneſs to matter. Every poſſible ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
is produced, and inſtantly deſtroyed. If
a glimpſe or dawn of order appears for a moment,
it is inſtantly hurried away and confounded, by
that never-ceaſing force, which actuates every
part of matter.</p>
               <p>Thus the univerſe goes on for many ages in a
continued ſucceſſion of chaos and diſorder. But
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0455900400:88"/>
is it not poſſible that it may ſettle at laſt, ſo as not
to loſe its motion and active force (for that we
have ſuppoſed inherent in it) yet ſo as to preſerve
an uniformity of appearance, amidſt the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
motion and fluctuation of its parts? This
we find to be the caſe with the univerſe at preſent.
Every individual is perpetually changing, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part of every individual, and yet the whole
remains, in appearance, the ſame. May we not
hope for ſuch a poſition, or rather be aſſured of
it, from the eternal revolutions of unguided mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and may not this account for all the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wiſdom and contrivance, which is in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe?
Let us contemplate the ſubject a little,
and we ſhall find, that this adjuſtment, if attained
by matter, of a ſeeming ſtability in the forms,
with a real and perpetual revolution or motion of
parts, affords a plauſible, if not a true ſolution of
the difficulty.</p>
               <p>It is in vain, therefore, to inſiſt upon the uſes
of the parts in animals or vegetables and their
curious adjuſtment to each other. I would fain
know how an animal could ſubſiſt, unleſs its parts
were ſo adjuſted? Do we not find, that it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
periſhes whenever this adjuſtment ceaſes,
and that its matter corrupting tries ſome new
form? It happens, indeed, that the parts of the
world are ſo well adjuſted, that ſome regular form
immediately lays claim to this corrupted matter:
and if it were not ſo, could the world ſubſiſt?
Muſt it not diſſolve as well as the animal, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0455900400:89"/>
paſs through new poſitions and ſituations; till in
a great, but finite ſucceſſion, it fall at laſt into the
preſent or ſome ſuch order?</p>
               <p>It is well, replied CLEANTHES, you told us,
that this hypotheſis was ſuggeſted on a ſudden, in
the courſe of the argument. Had you had leiſure
to examine it, you would ſoon have perceived the
inſuperable objections, to which it is expoſed.
No form, you ſay, can ſubſiſt, unleſs it poſſeſs
thoſe powers and organs, requiſite for its ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
ſome new order or oeconomy muſt be
tried, and ſo on, without intermiſſion; till at laſt
ſome order, which can ſupport and maintain it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
is fallen upon. But according to this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
whence ariſe the many conveniencies and
advantages, which men and all animals poſſeſs?
Two eyes, two ears, are not abſolutely neceſſary
for the ſubſiſtence of the ſpecies. Human race
might have been propagated and preſerved, without
horſes, dogs, cows, ſheep, and thoſe innumerable
fruits and products, which ſerve to our ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and enjoyment. If no camels had been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
for the uſe of man in the ſandy deſerts of
AFRICA and ARABIA, would the world have
been diſſolved? If no loadſtone had been framed
to give that wonderful and uſeful direction to the
needle, would human ſociety and the human
kind have been immediately extinguiſhed?
Though the maxims of Nature be in general very
frugal, yet inſtances of this kind are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rare; and any one of them is a ſufficient
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0455900400:90"/>
proof of deſign, and of a benevolent deſign,
which gave riſe to the order and arrangement of
the univerſe.</p>
               <p>At leaſt, you may ſafely infer, ſaid PHILO,
that the foregoing hypotheſis is ſo far incomplete
and imperfect; which I ſhall not ſcruple to allow.
But can we ever reaſonably expect greater ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in any attempts of this nature? Or can we
ever hope to erect a ſyſtem of coſmogony, that
will be liable to no exceptions, and will contain
no circumſtance repugnant to our limited and
imperfect experience of the analogy of Nature?
Your theory itſelf cannot ſurely pretend to any
ſuch advantage; even though you have run into
<hi>Authropomorphiſm,</hi> the better to preſerve a
conformity to common experience. Let us once
more put it to trial. In all inſtances which we
have ever ſeen, ideas are copied from real ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and are ectypal, not archetypal, to expreſs
myſelf in learned terms: You reverſe this order,
and give thought the precedence. In all inſtances
which we have ever ſeen, thought has no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon matter, except where that matter
is ſo conjoined with it, as to have an equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
influence upon it. No animal can move
immediately any thing but the members of its
own body; and indeed, the equality of action
and re-action ſeems to be an univerſal law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
But your theory implies a contradiction to
this experience. Theſe inſtances, with many
more, which it were eaſy to collect, (particularly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0455900400:91"/>
the ſuppoſition of a mind or ſyſtem of thought
that is eternal, or in other words, an animal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generable
and immortal) theſe inſtances, I ſay,
may teach, all of us, ſobriety in condemning each
other; and let us ſee, that as no ſyſtem of this
kind ought ever to be received from a ſlight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy,
ſo neither ought any to be rejected on
account of a ſmall incongruity. For that is an
inconvenience, from which we can juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
no one to be exempted.</p>
               <p>All religious ſyſtems, it is confeſſed, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to great and inſuperable difficulties. Each
diſputant triumphs in his turn; while he carries
on an offenſive war, and expoſes the abſurdities,
barbarities, and pernicious tenets of his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt.
But all of them, on the whole, prepare a
complete triumph for the <hi>Sceptic;</hi> who tells them,
that no ſyſtem ought ever to be embraced with
regard to ſuch ſubjects: For this plain reaſon,
that no abſurdity ought ever to be aſſented to with
regard to any ſubject. A total ſuſpenſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is here our only reaſonable reſource. And
if every attack, as is commonly obſerved, and
no defence, among Theologians, is ſucceſsful;
how complete muſt be <hi>his</hi> victory, who remains
always, with all mankind, on the offenſive, and
has himſelf no fixed ſtation or abiding city, which
he is ever, on any occaſion, obliged to deſend?</p>

                  <note place="margin">Part IX.</note> ſaid DEMEA; had we not

<hi>a priori,</hi> which, by offering to us infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
cuts off at once all doubt and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty?
By this argument too, we may prove the
INFINITY of the divine attributes, which, I
am afraid, can never be aſcertained with certainty
from any other topic. For how can an effect,
which either is finite, or, for aught we know,
may be ſo; how can ſuch an effect, I ſay, prove
an infinite cauſe? The unity too of the Divine
Nature, it is very difficult, if not abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
to deduce merely from contemplating
the works of nature; nor will the uniformity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
of the plan, even were it allowed, give us
any aſſurance of that attribute. Whereas the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<hi>a priori..</hi>....</p>
               <p>You ſeem to reaſon, DEMEA, interpoſed CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANTHES,
as if thoſe advantages and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the abſtract argument were full proofs of
its ſolidity. But it is firſt proper, in my opinion,
to determine what argument of this nature you
chuſe to inſiſt on; and we ſhall afterwards, from
itſelf, better than from its <hi>uſeful</hi> conſequences,
endeavour to determine what value we ought to
put upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0455900400:93"/>
The argument, replied DEMEA, which I would
inſiſt on is the common one. Whatever exiſts
muſt have a cauſe or reaſon of its exiſtence; it
being abſolutely impoſſible for any thing thing to
produce itſelf, or be the cauſe of its own exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
In mounting up, therefore, from effects
to cauſes, we muſt either go on in tracing an
infinite ſucceſſion, without any ultimate cauſe at
all, or muſt at laſt have recourſe to ſome ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
cauſe, that is <hi>neceſſarily</hi> exiſtent: Now
that the firſt ſuppoſition is abſurd may be thus
proved. In the infinite chain or ſucceſſion of
cauſes and effects, each ſingle effect is determined
to exiſt by the power and efficacy of that cauſe,
which immediately preceded; but the whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
chain or ſucceſſion, taken together, is not
determined or cauſed by any thing: and yet it
is evident that it requires a cauſe or reaſon, as
much as any particular object, which begins to
exiſt in time. The queſtion is ſtill reaſonable,
Why this particular ſucceſſion of cauſes exiſted
from eternity, and not any other ſucceſſion, or
no ſucceſſion at all. If there be no neceſſarily-exiſtent
being, any ſuppoſition, which can be
formed, is equally poſſible; nor is there any more
abſurdity in Nothing's having exiſted from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
than there is in that ſucceſſion of cauſes,
which conſtitutes the univerſe. What was it
then, which determined ſomething to exiſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than nothing, and beſtowed being on a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
poſſibility, excluſive of the reſt? <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0455900400:94"/>
cauſes,</hi> there are ſuppoſed to be none.
<hi>Chance</hi> is a word without a meaning. Was it
<hi>Nothing?</hi> But that can never produce any
thing. We muſt, therefore, have recourſe to a
neceſſarily-exiſtent Being, who carries the REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON
of his exiſtence in himſelf; and who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſuppoſed not to exiſt without an expreſs
contradiction. There is conſequently ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that is, there is a Deity.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not leave it to PHILO, ſaid CLEAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THES,
(though I know that the ſtarting objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is his chief delight) to point out the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this metaphyſical reaſoning. It ſeems to
me ſo obviouſly ill-grounded, and at the ſame
time of ſo little conſequence to the cauſe of true
piety and religion, that I ſhall myſelf venture to
ſhow the fallacy of it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with obſerving, that there is an
evident abſurdity in pretending to demonſtrate a
matter of fact, or to prove it by any arguments
<hi>a priori.</hi> Nothing is demonſtrable, unleſs the
contrary implies a contradiction. Nothing, that
is diſtinctly conceivable, implies a contradiction.
Whatever we conceive as exiſtent, we can alſo
conceive as non-exiſtent. There is no being,
therefore, whoſe non-exiſtence implies a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
Conſequently there is no being, whoſe
exiſtence is demonſtrable. I propoſe this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as entirely deciſive, and am willing to reſt
the whole controverſy upon it.</p>
               <p>It is pretended that the Deity is a neceſſarily-exiſtent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0455900400:95"/>
exiſtent being; and this neceſſity of his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is attempted to be explained by aſſerting,
that, if we knew his whole eſſence or nature, we
ſhould perceive it to be as impoſſible for him not
to exiſt as for twice two not to be four. But it
is evident, that this can never happen, while our
faculties remain the ſame as at preſent. It will
ſtill be poſſible for us, at any time, to conceive
the non-exiſtence of what we formerly conceived
to exiſt; nor can the mind ever lie under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of ſuppoſing any object to remain always
in being; in the ſame manner as we lie under a
neceſſity of always conceiving twice two to be
four. The words, therefore, <hi>neceſſary exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
have no meaning; or, which is the ſame
thing, none that is conſiſtent.</p>
               <p>But farther; why may not the material uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
be the neceſſarily-exiſtent Being, according
to this pretended explication of neceſſity? We
dare not affirm that we know all the qualities of
matter; and for aught we can determine, it may
contain ſome qualities, which, were they known,
would make its non-exiſtence appear as great a
contradiction as that twice two is five. I find
only one argument employed to prove, that the
material world is not the neceſſarily-exiſtent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and this argument is derived from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency
both of the matter and the form of the
world. <q>Any particle of matter,</q> 'tis ſaid<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr Clarke.</note>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0455900400:96"/>
                  <q>may be <hi>conceived</hi> to be annihilated; and any
form may be <hi>conceived</hi> to be altered. Such
an annihilation or alteration, therefore, is not
impoſſible.</q> But it ſeems a great partiality
not to perceive, that the ſame argument extends
equally to the Deity, ſo far as we have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of him; and that the mind can at leaſt
imagine him to be non-exiſtent, or his attributes
to be altered. It muſt be ſome unknown, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
qualities, which can make his non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence
appear impoſſible, or his attributes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable:
And no reaſon can be aſſigned, why
theſe qualities may not belong to matter. As
they are altogether unknown and inconceivable,
they can never be proved incompatible with it.</p>
               <p>Add to this, that in tracing an eternal ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of objects, it ſeems abſurd to enquire for a
general cauſe or firſt author. How can any
thing, that exiſts from eternity, have a cauſe;
ſince that relation implies a priority in time and a
beginning of exiſtence?</p>
               <p>In ſuch a chain too, or ſucceſſion of objects,
each part is cauſed by that which preceded it,
and cauſes that which ſucceeds it. Where then
is the difficulty? But the WHOLE, you
ſay, wants a cauſe. I anſwer, that the uniting
of theſe parts into a whole, like the uniting of
ſeveral diſtinct counties into one kingdom, or
ſeveral diſtinct members into one body, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
merely by an arbitrary act of the mind,
and has no influence on the nature of things.
Did I ſhow you the particular cauſes of each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0455900400:97"/>
in a collection of twenty particles of
matter, I ſhould think it very unreaſonable, ſhould
you afterwards aſk me, what was the cauſe of
the whole twenty. That is ſufficiently explained
in explaining the cauſe of the parts.</p>
               <p>Though the reaſonings, which you have urged,
CLEANTHES, may well excuſe me, ſaid PHILO,
from ſtarting any farther difficulties; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear inſiſting ſtill upon another topic.
'Tis obſerved by arithmeticians, that the products
of 9 compoſe always either 9 or ſome leſſer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of 9; if you add together all the characters,
of which any of the former products is compoſed.
Thus, of 18, 27, 36, which are products of 9,
you make 9 by adding 1 to 8, 2 to 7, 3 to 6.
Thus 369 is a product alſo of 9; and if you add
3, 6, and 9, you make 18, a leſſer product of
9<note n="*" place="bottom">Republique des Lettres, Aout, 1685.</note>. To a ſuperficial obſerver, ſo wonderful a
regularity may be admired as the effect either of
chance or deſign; but a ſkilful algebraiſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
concludes it to be the work of neceſſity,
and demonſtrates, that it muſt for ever reſult
from the nature of theſe numbers. Is it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
I aſk, that the whole oeconomy of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe
is conducted by a like neceſſity, though
no human algebra can furniſh a key, which ſolves
the difficulty? And inſtead of admiring the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of natural beings, may it not happen, that,
could we penetrate into the intimate nature of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0455900400:98"/>
bodies, we ſhould clearly ſee why it was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impoſſible, they could ever admit of any other
diſpoſition? So dangerous is it to introduce this
idea of neceſſity into the preſent queſtion! and
ſo naturally does it afford an inference directly
oppoſite to the religious hypotheſis!</p>
               <p>But dropping all theſe abſtractions, continued
PHILO; and confining ourſelves to more familiar
topics; I ſhall venture to add an obſervation,
that the argument <hi>a priori</hi> has ſeldom been found
very convincing, except to people of a metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
head, who have accuſtomed themſelves to
abſtract reaſoning, and who finding from mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,
that the underſtanding frequently leads
to truth, through obſcurity, and contrary to firſt
appearances, have transferred the ſame habit of
thinking to ſubjects, where it ought not to have
place. Other people, even of good ſenſe and
the beſt inclined to religion, feel always ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
in ſuch arguments, though they are not
perhaps able to explain diſtinctly where it lies.
A certain proof, that men ever did, and ever
will derive their religion from other ſources than
from this ſpecies of reaſoning.</p>

So anxious or ſo tedious are even the

of all our hopes and fears. We inceſſantly look
forward, and endeavour, by prayers, adoration,
and ſacrifice, to appeaſe thoſe unknown powers,
whom we find, by experience, ſo able to afflict
and oppreſs us. Wretched creatures that we are!
what reſource for us amidſt the innumerable ills
of life, did not Religion ſuggeſt ſome methods
of atonement, and appeaſe thoſe terrors, with
which we are inceſſantly agitated and tormented?</p>
               <p>I am indeed perſuaded, ſaid PHILO, that the
beſt and indeed the only method of bringing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one to a due ſenſe of religion, is by juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
of the miſery and wickedneſs of
men. And for that purpoſe a talent of eloquence
and ſtrong imagery is more requiſite than that of
reaſoning and argument. For is it neceſſary to
prove, what every one feels within himſelf? 'Tis
only neceſſary to make us feel it, if poſſible,
more intimately and ſenſibly.</p>
               <p>The people, indeed, replied DEMEA, are
ſufficiently convinced of this great and melancholy
truth. The miſeries of life, the unhappineſs of
man, the general corruptions of our nature, the
unſatisfactory enjoyment of pleaſures, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
theſe phraſes have become almoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0455900400:100"/>
in all languages. And who can doubt of
what all men declare from their own immediate
feeling and experience?</p>
               <p>In this point, ſaid PHILO, the learned are
perfectly agreed with the vulgar; and in all let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>ſacred</hi> and <hi>profane,</hi> the topic of human
miſery has been inſiſted on with the moſt pathetic
eloquence, that ſorrow and melancholy could
inſpire. The poets, who ſpeak from ſentiment,
without a ſyſtem, and whoſe teſtimony has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the more authority, abound in images of this
nature. From HOMER down to Dr YOUNG,
the whole inſpired tribe have ever been ſenſible,
that no other repreſentation of things would
ſuit the feeling and obſervation of each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual.</p>
               <p>As to authorities, replied DEMEA, you need
not ſeek them. Look round this library of
CLEANTHES. I ſhall venture to affirm, that,
except authors of particular ſciences, ſuch as chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry
or botany, who have no occaſion to treat
of human life, there is ſcarce one of thoſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
writers, from whom the ſenſe of human
miſery has not, in ſome paſſage or other, extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a complaint and confeſſion of it. At leaſt,
the chance is entirely on that ſide; and no one
author has ever, ſo far as I can recollect, been
ſo extravagant as to deny it.</p>
               <p>There you muſt excuſe me, ſaid PHILO:
LEIBNITZ has denied it; and is perhaps the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0455900400:101"/>
firſt<note n="*" place="bottom">That ſentiment had been maintained by Dr King and ſome few others before LEIBNITZ; though by none of ſo great fame as that GERMAN philoſopher.</note>, who ventured upon ſo bold and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical
an opinion; at leaſt, the firſt, who made
it eſſential to his philoſophical ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>And by being the firſt, replied DEMEA, might
he not have been ſenſible of his error? For is
this a ſubject, in which philoſophers can propoſe
to make diſcoveries, eſpecially in ſo late an age?
And can any man hope by a ſimple denial (for
the ſubject ſcarcely admits of reaſoning) to bear
down the united teſtimony of mankind, founded
on ſenſe and conſciouſneſs?</p>
               <p>And why ſhould man, added he, pretend to
an exemption from the lot of all other animals?
The whole earth, believe me, PHILO, is curſed
and polluted. A perpetual war is kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all living creatures. Neceſſity, hunger,
want, ſtimulate the ſtrong and courageous: Fear,
anxiety, terror, agitate the weak and infirm.
The firſt entrance into life gives anguiſh to the
new-born infant and to its wretched parent:
Weakneſs, impotence, diſtreſs, attend each ſtage
of that life: and 'tis at laſt finiſhed in agony and
horror.</p>
               <p>Obſerve too, ſays PHILO, the curious artifices
of Nature, in order to imbitter the life of every
living being. The ſtronger prey upon the weaker,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0455900400:102"/>
and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety.
The weaker too, in their turn, often prey upon
the ſtronger, and vex and moleſt them without
relaxation. Conſider that innumerable race of
inſects, which either are bred on the body of each
animal, or flying about infix their ſtings in him.
Theſe inſects have others ſtill leſs than themſelves,
which torment them. And thus on each hand,
before and behind, above and below, every ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
is ſurrounded with enemies, which inceſſantly
ſeek his miſery and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Man alone, ſaid DEMEA, ſeems to be, in part,
an exception to this rule. For by combination in
ſociety, he can eaſily maſter lions, tygers, and
bears, whoſe greater ſtrength and agility natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enable them to prey upon him.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, it is here chiefly, cried PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LO,
that the uniform and equal maxims of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are moſt apparent. Man, it is true, can, by
combination, ſurmount all his <hi>real</hi> enemies, and
become maſter of the whole animal creation: but
does he not immediately raiſe up to himſelf <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi>
enemies, the daemons of his fancy, who
haunt him with ſuperſtitious terrors, and blaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
enjoyment of life? His pleaſure, as he
imagines, becomes, in their eyes, a crime: his
food and repoſe give them umbrage and offence:
his very ſleep and dreams furniſh new materials
to anxious fear: and even death, his refuge
from every other ill, preſents only the dread of
endleſs and innumerable woes. Nor does the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0455900400:103"/>
wolf moleſt more the timid flock, than ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
does the anxious breaſt of wretched mortals.</p>
               <p>Beſides, conſider, DEMEA; this very ſociety, by
which we ſurmount thoſe wild beaſts, our natural
enemies; what new enemies does it not raiſe to
us? What woe and miſery does it not occaſion?
Man is the greateſt enemy of man. Oppreſſion,
injuſtice, contempt, contumely, violence, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
war, calumny, treachery, fraud; by theſe
they mutually torment each other: and they
would ſoon diſſolve that ſociety which they had
formed, were it not for the dread of ſtill greater
ills, which muſt attend their ſeparation.</p>
               <p>But though theſe external inſults, ſaid DEMEA,
from animals, from men, from all the elements,
which aſſault us, form a frightful catalogue of
woes, they are nothing in compariſon of thoſe,
which ariſe within ourſelves, from the diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
condition of our mind and body. How many
lie under the lingering torment of diſeaſes? Hear
the pathetic enumeration of the great poet.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Inteſtine ſtone and ulcer, colic-pangs,</l>
                  <l>Daemoniac frenzy, moping melancholy,</l>
                  <l>And moon-ſtruck madneſs, pining atrophy,</l>
                  <l>Maraſmus and wide-waſting peſtilence.</l>
                  <l>Dire was the toſſing, deep the groans: DESPAIR</l>
                  <l>Tended the ſick, buſieſt from couch to couch.</l>
                  <l>And over them triumphant DEATH his dart</l>
                  <l>Shook, but delay'd to ſtrike, tho' oft invok'd</l>
                  <l>With vows, as their chief good and final hope.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0455900400:104"/>
The diſorders of the mind, continued DEMEA,
though more ſecret, are not perhaps leſs diſmal
and vexatious. Remorſe, ſhame, anguiſh, rage,
diſappointment, anxiety, fear, dejection, deſpair;
who has ever paſſed through life without cruel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads
from theſe tormentors? How many have
ſcarcely ever felt any better ſenſations? Labour
and poverty, ſo abhorred by every one, are the
certain lot of the far greater number: and thoſe
few privileged perſons, who enjoy eaſe and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
never reach contentment or true felicity.
All the goods of life united would not make a
very happy man: but all the ills united would
make a wretch indeed; and any one of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
(and who can be free from every one) nay
often the abſence of one good (and who can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
all) is ſufficient to render life ineligible.</p>
               <p>Were a ſtranger to drop, on a ſudden, into this
world, I would ſhow him, as a ſpecimen of its
ills, an hoſpital full of diſeaſes, a priſon crowded
with malefactors and debtors, a field of battle
ſtrowed with carcaſes, a fleet foundering in the
ocean, a nation languiſhing under tyranny, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
or peſtilence. To turn the gay ſide of life
to him, and give him a notion of its pleaſures;
whither ſhould I conduct him? to a ball, to an
opera, to court? He might juſtly think, that I
was only ſhowing him a diverſity of diſtreſs and
ſorrow.</p>
               <p>There is no evading ſuch ſtriking inſtances,
ſaid PHILO, but by apologies, which ſtill farther
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0455900400:105"/>
aggravate the charge. Why have all men, I aſk,
in all ages, complained inceſſantly of the miſeries
of life?. — They have no juſt reaſon, ſays one:
theſe complaints proceed only from their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
repining, anxious diſpoſition — And
can there poſſibly, I reply, be a more certain
foundation of miſery, than ſuch a wretched tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?</p>
               <p>But if they were really as unhappy as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
ſays my antagoniſt, why do they remain in
life? —.</p>
               <q>Not ſatisfied with life, afraid of death.</q>
               <p>This is the ſecret chain, ſay I, that holds us. We
are terrified, not bribed to the continuance of our
exiſtence.</p>
               <p>It is only a falſe delicacy, he may inſiſt, which
a few refined ſpirits indulge, and which has ſpread
theſe complaints among the whole race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
 — And what is this delicacy, I aſk,
which you blame? Is it any thing but a greater
ſenſibility to all the pleaſures and pains of life?
and if the man of a delicate, refined temper, by
being ſo much more alive than the reſt of the
world, is only ſo much more unhappy; what
judgement muſt we form in general of human
life?</p>
               <p>Let men remain at reſt, ſays our adverſary;
and they will be eaſy. They are willing artificers
of their own miſery. — No! reply I; an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0455900400:106"/>
languor follows their repoſe: diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vexation, trouble, their activity and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I can obſerve ſomething like what you mention
in ſome others, replied CLEANTHES: but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
I feel little or nothing of it in myſelf; and
hope that it is not ſo common as you repreſent it.</p>
               <p>If you feel not human miſery yourſelf, cried
DEMEA, I congratulate you on ſo happy a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.
Others, ſeemingly the moſt proſperous,
have not been aſhamed to vent their complaints in
the moſt melancholy ſtrains. Let us attend to the
great, the fortunate Emperor, CHARLES V,
when, tired with human grandeur, he reſigned
all his extenſive dominions into the hands of his
ſon. In the laſt harangue, which he made on
that memorable occaſion, he publicly avowed,
<hi>that the greateſt proſperities which he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enjoyed, had been mixed with ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
that he might truly ſay he had never
enjoyed any ſatisfaction or contentment</hi> But
did the retired life, in which he ſought for ſhelter,
afford him any greater happineſs? If we may
credit his ſon's account, his repentance commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the very day of his reſignation.</p>
               <p>CICERO's fortune, from ſmall beginnings, roſe
to the greateſt luſtre and renown; yet what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic
complaints of the ills of life do his familiar
letters, as well as philoſophical diſcourſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?
And ſuitably to his own experience, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces
CATO, the great, the fortunate CATO,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0455900400:107"/>
proteſting in his old age, that, had he a new life
in his offer, he would reject the preſent.</p>
               <p>Aſk yourſelf, aſk any of your acquaintance,
whether they would live over again the laſt ten or
twenty years of their life. No! but the next
twenty, they ſay, will be better:
<q>
                     <l>And from the dregs of life, hope to receive</l>
                     <l>What the firſt ſprightly running could not give.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus at laſt they find (ſuch is the greatneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
miſery; it reconciles even contradictions)
that they complain, at once, of the ſhortneſs of
life, and of its vanity and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>And is it poſſible, CLEANTHES, ſaid PHILO,
that after all theſe reflections, and infinitely more,
which might be ſuggeſted, you can ſtill perſevere
in your Anthropomorphiſm, and aſſert the moral
attributes of the Deity, his juſtice, benevolence,
mercy, and rectitude, to be of the ſame nature
with theſe virtues in human creatures? His
power we allow infinite: whatever he wills is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted:
but neither man nor any other animal are
happy: therefore he does not will their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
His wiſdom is infinite: he is never miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in chuſing the means to any end: but the
courſe of Nature tends not to human or animal
felicity: therefore it is not eſtabliſhed for that
purpoſe. Through the whole compaſs of human
knowledge, there are no inferences more certain
and infallible than theſe. In what reſpect, then,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0455900400:108"/>
do his benevolence and mercy reſemble the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
and mercy of men?</p>
               <p>EPICURUS's old queſtions are yet unanſwered.</p>
               <p>Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able?
then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing?
then is he malevolent. Is he both able and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
whence then is evil?</p>
               <p>You aſcribe, CLEANTHES, (and I believe
juſtly) a purpoſe and intention to Nature. But
what, I beſeech you, is the object of that curious
artifice and machinery, which ſhe has diſplayed in
all animals? The preſervation alone of individuals
and propagation of the ſpecies. It ſeems enough
for her purpoſe, if ſuch a rank be barely upheld
in the univerſe, without any care or concern for
the happineſs of the members, that compoſe it.
No reſource for this purpoſe: no machinery, in
order merely to give pleaſure or eaſe: no fund of
pure joy and contentment: no indulgence without
ſome want or neceſſity, accompanying it. At
leaſt, the ſew phenomena of this nature are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanced
by oppoſite phenomena of ſtill greater
importance.</p>
               <p>Our ſenſe of muſic, harmony, and indeed
beauty of all kinds gives ſatisfaction, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abſolutely neceſſary to the preſervation and
propagation of the ſpecies. But what racking
pains, on the other hand, ariſe from gouts, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
megrims, tooth-achs, rheumatiſms; where
the injury to the animal-machinery is either ſmall
or incurable? Mirth, laughter, play, frolic, ſeem
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0455900400:109"/>
gratuitous ſatisfactions, which have no farther
tendency: ſpleen, melancholy, diſcontent, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
are pains of the ſame nature. How then
does the divine benevolence diſplay itſelf, in the
ſenſe of you Anthropomorphites? None but
we Myſtics, as you were pleaſed to call us, can
account for this ſtrange mixture of phenomena,
by deriving it from attributes, infinitely perfect,
but incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>And have you at laſt, ſaid CLEANTHES ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
betrayed your intentions, PHILO? Your
long agreement with DEMEA did indeed a little
ſurpriſe me; but I find you were all the while
crecting a concealed battery againſt me. And I
muſt confeſs, that you have now fallen upon a
ſubject, worthy of your noble ſpirit of oppoſition
and controverſy. If you can make out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
point, and prove mankind to be unhappy or
corrupted, there is an end at once of all religion.
For to what purpoſe eſtabliſh the natural attributes
of the Deity, while the moral are ſtill doubtful
and uncertain?</p>
               <p>You take umbrage very eaſily, replied DEMEA,
at opinions the moſt innocent, and the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
received even amongſt the religious and
devout themſelves: and nothing can be more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
than to find a topic like this, concerning
the wickedneſs and miſery of man, charged with
no leſs than Atheiſm and profaneneſs. Have not
all pious divines and preachers, who have indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their rhetoric on ſo fertile a ſubject; have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0455900400:110"/>
they not eaſily, I ſay, given a ſolution of any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
which may attend it? This world is but
a point in compariſon of the univerſe: this life
but a moment in compariſon of eternity. The
preſent evil phenomena, therefore, are rectified
in other regions, and in ſome future period of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.
And the eyes of men, being then open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to larger views of things, ſee the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
of general laws, and trace, with adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the benevolence and rectitude of the Deity,
through all the mazes and intricacies of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>No! replied CLEANTHES, No! Theſe arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſuppoſitions can never be admitted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to matter of fact, viſible and uncontrovert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Whence can any cauſe be known but from
its known effects? Whence can any hypotheſis
be proved but from the apparent phenomena?
To eſtabliſh one hypotheſis upon another is build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entirely in the air; and the utmoſt we ever
attain, by theſe conjectures and fictions, is to
aſcertain the bare poſſibility of our opinion; but
never can we, upon ſuch terms, eſtabliſh its
reality.</p>
               <p>The only method of ſupporting divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
(and it is what I willingly embrace) is
to deny abſolutely the miſery and wickedneſs
of man. Your repreſentations are exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Your melancholy views moſtly fictitious:
Your inferences contrary to fact and experience.
Health is more common than ſickneſs: Pleaſure
than pain: Happineſs than miſery. And for one
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0455900400:111"/>
vexation, which we meet with, we attain, upon
computation, a hundred enjoyments.</p>
               <p>Admitting your poſition, replied PHILO, which
yet is extremely doubtful; you muſt, at the
ſame time, allow, that, if pain be leſs frequent
than pleaſure, it is infinitely more violent and
durable. One hour of it is often able to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh
a day, a week, a month of our common
inſipid enjoyments: And how many days, weeks,
and months are paſſed by ſeveral in the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
torments? Pleaſure, ſcarcely in one inſtance,
is ever able to reach ecſtaſy and rapture: And
in no one inſtance can it continue for any time
at its higheſt pitch and altitude. The ſpirits e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate;
the nerves relax; the fabric is diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
and the enjoyment quickly degenerates
into fatigue and uneaſineſs. But pain often,
good God, how often! riſes to torture and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony;
and the longer it continues, it becomes
ſtill more genuine agony and torture. Patience
is exhauſted; courage languiſhes; melancholy
ſeizes us; and nothing terminates our miſery but
the removal of its cauſe, or another event, which
is the ſole cure of all evil, but which, from our
natural folly, we regard with ſtill greater horror
and conſternation.</p>
               <p>But not to inſiſt upon theſe topics, continued
PHILO, though moſt obvious, certain, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant;
I muſt uſe the freedom to admoniſh
you, CLEANTHES, that you have put the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
upon a moſt dangerous iſſue, and are,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0455900400:112"/>
unawares introducing a total Scepticiſm into the
moſt eſſential articles of natural and revealed the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology.
What! no method of fixing a juſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for religion, unleſs we allow the happineſs
of human life, and maintain a continued exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
even in this world, with all our preſent pains,
infirmities, vexations, and follies, to be eligible
and deſireable! But this is contrary to every one's
feeling and experience: It is contrary to an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
ſo eſtabliſhed as nothing can ſubvert:
No deciſive proofs can ever be produced againſt
this authority; nor is it poſſible for you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
eſtimate, and compare all the pains and all
the pleaſures in the lives of all men and of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals:
And thus by your reſting the whole ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
of religion on a point, which, from its very
nature, muſt for ever be uncertain, you tacitly
confeſs, that that ſyſtem is equally uncertain.</p>
               <p>But allowing you, what never will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
at leaſt, what you never poſſibly can
prove, that animal, or at leaſt, human happineſs
in this life exceeds its miſery; you have yet done
nothing: For this is not, by any means, what
we expect from infinite power, infinite wiſdom,
and infinite goodneſs. Why is there any miſery
at all in the world? Not by chance ſurely. From
ſome cauſe then. Is it from the intention of the
Deity? But he is perfectly benevolent. Is it
contrary to his intention? But he is almighty.
Nothing can ſhake the ſolidity of this reaſoning,
ſo ſhort, ſo clear, ſo deciſive; except we aſſert,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0455900400:113"/>
that theſe ſubjects exceed all human capacity,
and that our common meaſures of truth and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
are not applicable to them; a topic, which
I have all along inſiſted on, but which you have,
from the beginning, rejected with ſcorn and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
               <p>But I will be contented to retire ſtill from this
intrenchment: For I deny that you can ever force
me in it: I will allow, that pain or miſery in man
is <hi>compatible</hi> with infinite power and goodneſs
in the Deity, even in your ſenſe of theſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes:
What are you advanced by all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions?
A mere poſſible compatibility is not
ſufficient. You muſt <hi>prove</hi> theſe pure, unmixt,
and uncontrollable attributes from the preſent
mixt and confuſed phenomena, and from theſe
alone. A hopeful undertaking! Were the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
ever ſo pure and unmixt, yet being
finite, they would be inſufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
How much more, where they are alſo ſo
jarring and diſcordant?</p>
               <p>Here, CLEANTHES, I find myſelf at eaſe in
my argument. Here I triumph. Formerly, when
we argued concerning the natural attributes of
intelligence and deſign, I needed all my ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and metaphyſical ſubtilty to elude your graſp.
In many views of the univerſe, and of its parts,
particularly the latter, the beauty and fitneſs of
final cauſes ſtrike us with ſuch irreſiſtible force,
that all objections appear (what I believe they
really are) mere cavils and ſophiſms; nor can
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0455900400:114"/>
we then imagine how it was ever poſſible for us
to repoſe any weight on them. But there is no
view of human life or of the condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
from which, without the greateſt violence,
we can infer the moral attributes, or learn that
infinite benevolence, conjoined with infinite power
and infinite wiſdom, which we muſt diſcover by
the eyes of faith alone. It is your turn now to
tug the labouring oar, and to ſupport your phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
ſubtilties againſt the dictates of plain
reaſon and experience.</p>

            <div n="11" type="part">

               <p>I ſcruple not to allow, ſaid CLEANTHES, that
I have been apt to ſuſpect the frequent repetition
of the word, <hi>infinite,</hi> which we meet with in all
theological writers, to favour more of panegyric
than of philoſophy, and that any purpoſes of
reaſoning, and even of religion, would be better

preſerve human analogy, we muſt for ever find
it impoſſible to reconcile any mixture of evil in
the univerſe with infinite attributes; much leſs,
can we ever prove the latter from the former.
But ſuppoſing the Author of Nature to be finite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect, though far exceeding mankind; a
ſatisfactory account may then be given of natural
and moral evil, and every untoward phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non

be ſubmitted to, in order to reach
a deſirable end: And in a word, benevolence,
regulated by wiſdom, and limited by neceſſity,
may produce juſt ſuch a world as the preſent.
You, PHILO, who are ſo prompt at ſtarting
views, and reflections, and analogies; I would
gladly hear, at length, without interruption, your
opinion of this new theory; and if it deſerve our
attention, we may afterwards, at more leiſure,
reduce it into form.</p>
               <p>My ſentiments, replied PHILO, are not worth
being made a myſtery of; and therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ceremony, I ſhall deliver what occurs to
me, with regard to the preſent ſubject. It muſt,
I think, be allowed, that, if a very limited intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
whom we ſhall ſuppoſe utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the univerſe, were aſſured, that it
were the production of a very good, wiſe, and
powerful being, however finite, he would, from
his conjectures, form <hi>beforehand</hi> a different
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0455900400:116"/>
notion of it from what we find it to be by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
nor would he ever imagine, merely from
theſe attributes of the cauſe, of which he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that the effect could be ſo full of vice
and miſery and diſorder, as it appears in this life.
Suppoſing now, that this perſon were brought
into the world, ſtill aſſured, that it was the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
of ſuch a ſublime and benevolent Being;
he might, perhaps, be ſurpriſed at the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment;
but would never retract his former
belief, if founded on any very ſolid argument;
ſince ſuch a limited intelligence muſt be ſenſible
of his own blindneſs and ignorance, and muſt
allow, that there may be many ſolutions of thoſe
phenomena, which will for ever eſcape his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.
But ſuppoſing, which is the real
caſe with regard to man, that this creature is
not antecedently convinced of a ſupreme intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
benevolent, and powerful, but is left to
gather ſuch a belief from the appearances of
things; this entirely alters the caſe, nor will he
ever find any reaſon for ſuch a concluſion. He may
be fully convinced of the narrow limits of his
underſtanding; but this will not help him in
forming an inference concerning the goodneſs of
ſuperior powers, ſince he muſt form that inference
from what he knows, not from what he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of. The more you exaggerate his weakneſs
and ignorance, the more diffident you render
him, and give him the greater ſuſpicion, that
ſuch ſubjects are beyond the reach of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0455900400:117"/>
You are obliged, therefore, to reaſon
with him merely from the known phenomena,
and to drop every arbitrary ſuppoſition or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
               <p>Did I ſhow you a houſe or palace, where

where the windows, doors, fires, paſſages,
ſtairs, and the whole oeconomy of the building
were the ſource of noiſe, confuſion, fatigue, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the extremes of heat and cold; you
would certainly blame the contrivance, without
any farther examination. The architect would
in vain diſplay his ſubtilty, and prove to you, that
if this door or that window were altered, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ills would enſue. What he ſays, may be
ſtrictly true: The alternation of one particular,
while the other parts of the building remain, may
only augment the inconveniencies. But ſtill you
would aſſert in general, that, if architect had
had ſkill and good intentions, he might have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch a plan of the whole, and might have
adjuſted the parts in ſuch a manner, as would
have remedied all or moſt of theſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
His ignorance, or even your own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of ſuch a plan, will never convince you of
the impoſſibility of it. If you find many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
and deformities in the building, you
will always, without entering into any detail,
condemn the architect.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I repeat the question: Is the world,
conſidered in general, and as it appears to us in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0455900400:118"/>
this life, different from what a man or ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Being would, <hi>beforehand,</hi> expect from
a very powerful, wiſe, and benevolent Deity?
It muſt be ſtrange prejudice to aſſert the contrary.
And form thence I conclude, that, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
the world may be, allowing certain ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
and conjectures, with the idea of ſuch a
Deity, it can never afford us an inference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his exiſtence. The conſiſtence is not
abſolutely denied, only the inference. Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
eſpecially where infinity is excluded from
the divine attributes, may, perhaps, be ſufficient
to prove a conſiſtence; but can never be founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for any inference.</p>
               <p>There ſeem to be <hi>four</hi> circumſtances, on
which depend all, or the greateſt part of the ills,
that moleſt ſenſible creatures; and it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
but all theſe circumſtances may be neceſſary
and unavoidable. We know ſo little beyond
common life, or even of common life, that, with
regard to the oeconomy of a univerſe, there is no
conjecture, however wild, which may not be
juſt; nor any one, however plauſible, which
may not be erroneous. All that belongs to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
underſtanding, in this deep ignorance and
obſcurity, is to be ſceptical, or at leaſt cautious;
and not to admit of any hypotheſis, whatever;
much leſs, of any which is ſupported by no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of probability. Now this I aſſert to be
the caſe with regard to all the cauſes of evil, and
the circumſtances, on which it depends. None
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0455900400:119"/>
of them appear to human reaſon, in the leaſt
degree, neceſſary or unavoidable; nor can we
ſuppoſe them ſuch, without the utmoſt licence of
imagination.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> circumſtance which introduces evil, is
that contrivance or oeconomy of the animal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by which pains, as well as pleaſures, are
employed to excite all creatures to action, and
make them vigilant in the great work of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
Now pleaſure alone, in its various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
ſeems to human underſtanding ſufficient
for this prupoſe. All animals might be conſtantly
in a ſtate of enjoyment; but when urged by any
of the neceſſities of nature, ſuch as thirſt, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
wearineſs; inſtead of pain, they might feel
a diminution of pleaſure, by which they might be
prompted to ſeek that object, which is neceſſary
to their ſubſiſtence. Men purſue pleaſure as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
as they avoid pain; at leaſt, might have
been ſo conſtituted. It ſeems, therefore, plainly
poſſible to carry on the buſineſs of life without
any pain. Why then is any animal ever render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuſceptible of ſuch a ſenſation? If animals
can be free from it an hour, they might enjoy a
perpetual exemption from it; and it required as
particular a contrivance of their organs to produce
that feeling, as to endow them with ſight, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or any of the ſenſes. Shall we conjecture,
that ſuch a contrivance was neceſſary, without any
appearance of reaſon? and ſhall we build on that
conjecture as on the moſt certain truth?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0455900400:120"/>
But a capacity of pain would not alone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
pain, were it not for the <hi>ſecond</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<hi>viz.</hi> the conducting of the world by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
laws; and this ſeems no wiſe neceſſary to a
very perfect being. It is true; if every thing
were conducted by particular volitions, the courſe
of nature would be perpetually broken, and no
man could employ his reaſon in the conduct of
life. But might not other particular volitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
this inconvenience? In ſhort, might not
the Deity exterminate all ill, where-ever it were
to be found; and produce all good, without any
preparation or long progreſs of cauſes and effects?</p>
               <p>Beſides, we muſt conſider, that, according to
the preſent oeconomy of the world, the courſe of
Nature, though ſuppoſed exactly regular, yet to
us appears not ſo, and many events are uncertain,
and many diſappoint our expectations. Health
and ſickneſs, calm and tempeſt, with an infinite
number of other accidents, whoſe cauſes are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
and variable, have a great influence both
on the fortunes of particular perſons and on the
proſperity of public ſocieties: and indeed all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
life, in a manner, depends on ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
A being, therefore, who knows the ſecret
ſprings of the univerſe, might eaſily, by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
volitions, turn all theſe accidents to the good
of mankind, and render the whole world happy,
without diſcovering himſelf in any operation. A
fleet, whoſe purpoſes were ſalutary to ſociety,
might always meet with a fair wind: Good princes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0455900400:121"/>
enjoy ſound health and long life: Perſons, born
to power and authority, be framed with good
tempers and virtuous diſpoſitions. A few ſuch
events as theſe, regularly and wiſely conducted,
would change the face of the world; and yet
would no more ſeem to diſturb the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or confound human conduct, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
oeconomy of things, where the cauſes are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and variable, and compounded. Some
ſmall touches, given to CALIGULA's brain in his
infancy, might have converted him into a TRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JAN:
one wave, a little higher than the reſt, by
burying CAESAR and his fortune in the bottom of
the ocean, might have reſtored liberty to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
part of mankind. There may, for aught
we know, be good reaſons, why Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes
not in this manner; but they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us: and though the mere ſuppoſition,
that ſuch reaſons exiſt, may be ſufficient to <hi>ſave</hi>
the concluſion concerning the divine attributes,
yet ſurely it can never be ſufficient to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi>
that concluſion.</p>
               <p>If every thing in the univerſe be conducted by
general laws, and if animals be rendered ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
of pain, it ſcarcely ſeems poſſible but ſome ill
muſt ariſe in the various ſhocks of matter, and
the various concurrence and oppoſition of general
laws: But this ill would be very rare, were it not
for the <hi>third</hi> circumſtance, which I propoſed to
mention, <hi>viz.</hi> the great frugality, with which all
powers and faculties are diſtributed to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0455900400:122"/>
being. So well adjuſted are the organs
and capacities of all animals, and ſo well fitted to
their preſervation, that, as far as hiſtory or tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
reaches, there appears not to be any ſingle
ſpecies, which has yet been extinguiſhed in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe.
Every animal has the requiſite endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but theſe endowments are beſtowed with
ſo ſcrupulous an oeconomy, that any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
diminution muſt entirely deſtroy the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Where-ever one power is encreaſed, there
is a proportional abatement in the others. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
which excel in ſwiftneſs, are commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in force. Thoſe, which poſſeſs both, are
either imperfect in ſome of their ſenſes, or are
oppreſſed with the moſt craving wants. The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſpecies, whoſe chief excellency is reaſon and
fagacity, is of all others the moſt neceſſitous, and
the moſt deficient in bodily advantages; without
cloaths, without arms, without food, without
lodging, without any convenience of life, except
what they owe to their own ſkill and induſtry. In
ſhort, Nature ſeems to have formed an exact cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the neceſſities of her creatures; and
like a <hi>rigid maſter,</hi> has afforded them little more
powers or endowments, than what are ſtrictly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to ſupply thoſe neceſſities. An <hi>indulgent
parent</hi> would have beſtowed a large ſtock, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to guard againſt accidents, and ſecure the
happineſs and welfare of the creature, in the moſt
unfortunate concurrence of circumſtances. Every
courſe of life would not have been ſo ſurrounded
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0455900400:123"/>
with precipices, that the leaſt departure from the
true path, by miſtake or neceſſity, muſt involve
us in miſery and ruin. Some reſerve, ſome fund
would have been provided to enſure happineſs;
nor would the powers and the neceſſities have
been adjuſted with ſo rigid an oeconomy. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Nature is inconceivably powerful: his
force is ſuppoſed great, if not altogether inexhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible:
nor is there any reaſon, as far as we can
judge, to make him obſerve this ſtrict frugality
in his dealings with his creatures. It would have
been better, were his power extremely limited, to
have created fewer animals, and to have endowed
theſe with more faculties for their happineſs and
preſervation. A builder is never eſteemed pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
who undertakes a plan, beyond what his
ſtock will enable him to finiſh.</p>
               <p>In order to cure moſt of the ills of human life,
I require not that man ſhould have the wings of
the eagle, the ſwiftneſs of the ſtag, the force of
the ox, the arms of the lion, the ſcales of the
crocodile or rhinoceros; much lefs do I demand
the ſagacity of an angel or cherubim. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to take an encreaſe in one ſingle power or
faculty of his ſoul. Let him be endowed with a
greater propenſity to induſtry and labour; a more
vigorous ſpring and activity of mind; a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
bent to buſineſs and application. Let the
whole ſpecies poſſeſs naturally an equal diligence
with that which many individuals are able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by habit and reflection; and the moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0455900400:124"/>
conſequences, without any allay of ill, is the
immediate and neceſſary reſult of this endowment.
Almoſt all the moral, as well as natural evils of
human life ariſe from idleneſs; and were our ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
by the original conſtitution of their frame,
exempt from this vice or infirmity, the perfect
cultivation of land, the improvement of arts and
manufactures, the exact execution of every office
and duty, immediately follow; and men at once
may fully reach that ſtate of ſociety, which is ſo
imperfectly attained by the beſt-regulated govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But as induſtry is a power, and the moſt
valuable of any, Nature ſeems determined, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to her uſual maxims, to beſtow it on men
with a very ſparing hand; and rather to puniſh
him ſeverely for his deficiency in it, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him for his attainments. She has ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
his frame, that nothing but the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
neceſſity can oblige him to labour; and ſhe
employs all his other wants to overcome, at leaſt
in part, the want of diligence, and to endow him
with ſome ſhare of a faculty, of which ſhe has
thought fit naturally to bereave him. Here our
demands may be allowed very humble, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the more reaſonable. If we required the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of ſuperior penetration and judgement,
of a more delicate taſte of beauty, of a nicer
ſenſibility to benevolence and friendſhip; we
might be told, that we impiouſly pretend to break
the order of Nature, that we want to exalt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a higher rank of being, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0455900400:125"/>
which we require, not being ſuitable to our
ſtate and condition, would only be pernicious to
us. But it is hard; I dare to repeat it, it is hard,
that being placed in a world ſo full of wants and
neceſſities; where almoſt every being and element
is either our foe or refuſes its aſſiſtance — we
ſhould alſo have our own temper to ſtruggle with,
and ſhould be deprived of that faculty, which can
alone fence againſt theſe multiplied evils.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> circumſtance, whence ariſes the
miſery and ill of the univerſe, is the inaccurate
workmanſhip of all the ſprings and principles of
the great machine of nature. It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that there are few parts of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
which ſeem not to ſerve ſome purpoſe, and
whoſe removal would not produce a viſible defect
and diſorder in the whole. The parts hang all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
nor can one be touched without affecting
the reſt, in a greater or leſs degree. But at the
ſame time, it muſt be obſerved, that none of
theſe parts or principles, however uſeful, are ſo
accurately adjuſted, as to keep preciſely within
thoſe bounds, in which their utility conſiſts; but
they are, all of them, apt, on every occaſion, to
run into the one extreme or the other. One
would imagine, that this grand production had
not received the laſt hand of the maker; ſo little
finiſhed is every part, and ſo coarſe are the
ſtrokes, with which it is executed. Thus, the
winds are requiſite to convey the vapours along
the ſurface of the globe, and to aſſiſt men in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0455900400:126"/>
but how oft, riſing up to tempeſts and
hurricanes, do they become pernicious? Rains
are neceſſary to nouriſh all the plants and animals
of the earth: but how often are they defective?
how often exceſſive? Heat is requiſite to all life
and vegetation; but is not always found in the
due proportion. On the mixture and ſecretion
of the humours and juices of the body depend the
health and proſperity of the animal: but the parts
perform not regularly their proper function. What
more uſeful than all the paſſions of the mind, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
vanity, love, anger? But how oft do
they break their bounds, and cauſe the greateſt
convulſions in ſociety? There is nothing ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
in the univerſe, but what frequently
becomes pernicious, by its exceſs or defect; nor
has Nature guarded, with the requiſite accuracy,
againſt all diſorder or confuſion. The irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is never, perhaps, ſo great as to deſtroy any
ſpecies; but is often ſufficient to involve the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
in ruin and miſery.</p>
               <p>On the concurrence, then, of theſe <hi>four</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
does all, or the greateſt part of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
evil depend. Were all living creatures inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of pain, or were the world adminiſtered by
particular volitions, evil never could have found
acceſs into the univerſe: and were animals en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with a large ſtock of powers and faculties,
beyond what ſtrict neceſſity requires; or were the
ſeveral ſprings and principles of the univerſe ſo
accurately framed as to preſerve always the juſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0455900400:127"/>
temperament and medium; there muſt have been
very little ill in compariſon of what we feel at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
What then ſhall we pronounce on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion?
Shall we ſay, that theſe circumſtances
are not neceſſary, and that they might eaſily have
been altered in the contrivance of the univerſe?
This deciſion ſeems too preſumptuous for crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ſo blind and ignorant. Let us be more
modeſt in our concluſions. Let us allow, that, if
the goodneſs of the Deity (I mean a goodneſs like
the human) could be eſtabliſhed on any tolerable
reaſons <hi>a priori,</hi> theſe phenomena, however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward,
would not be ſufficient to ſubvert that
principle; but might eaſily, in ſome unknown
manner, be reconcilable to it. But let us ſtill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
that as this goodneſs is not antecedently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed,
but muſt be inferred from the pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,
there can be no grounds for ſuch an infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
while there are ſo many ills in the univerſe,
and while theſe ills might ſo eaſily have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied,
as far as human underſtanding can be
allowed to judge on ſuch a ſubject. I am Sceptic
enough to allow, that the bad appearances, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all my reaſonings, may be compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with ſuch attributes as you ſuppoſe: But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they can never prove theſe attributes. Such a
concluſion cannot reſult from Scepticiſm; but
muſt ariſe from the phenomena, and from our
confidence in the reaſonings, which we deduce
from theſe phenomena.</p>
               <p>Look round this univerſe. What an immenſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0455900400:128"/>
profuſion of beings, animated and organized,
fenſible and active! You admire this prodigious
variety and fecundity. But inſpect a little more
narrowly theſe living exiſtences, the only beings
worth regarding. How hoſtile and deſtructive to
each other! How inſufficient all of them for
their own happineſs! How contemptible or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to the ſpectator! The whole preſents no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the idea of a blind Nature, impregnated
by a great vivifying principle, and pouring forth
from her lap, without diſcernment or parental
care, her maimed and abortive children.</p>
               <p>Here the MANICHAEAN ſyſtem occurs as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hypotheſis to ſolve the difficulty: and no
doubt, in ſome reſpects, it is very ſpecious, and
has more probability than the common hypotheſis,
by giving a plauſible account of the ſtrange mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of good and ill, which appears in life. But
if we conſider, on the other hand, the perfect
uniformity and agreement of the parts of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe,
we ſhall not diſcover in it any marks of
the combat of a malevolent with a benevolent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
There is indeed an oppoſition of pains and
pleaſures in the feelings of ſenſible creatures: but
are not all the operations of Nature carried on by
an oppoſition of principles, of hot and cold, moiſt
and dry, light and heavy? The true concluſion
is, that the original ſource of all things is entirely
indifferent to all theſe principles, and has no more
regard to good above ill than to heat above cold,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0455900400:129"/>
or to drought above moiſture, or to light above
heavy.</p>
               <p>There may <hi>four</hi> hypotheſes be framed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt cauſes of the univerſe; <hi>that</hi> they are
endowed with perfect goodneſs, <hi>that</hi> they have
perfect malice, <hi>that</hi> they are oppoſite and have
both goodneſs and malice, <hi>that</hi> they have neither
goodneſs nor malice. Mixt phenomena can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prove the two former unmixt principles,
And the uniformity and ſteadineſs of general
laws ſeems to oppoſe the third. The fourth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſeems by far the moſt probable.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid concerning natural evil will
apply to moral, with little or no variation; and
we have no more reaſon to infer, that the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the ſupreme Being reſembles human rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
than that his benevolence reſembles the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Nay, it will be thought, that we have ſtill
greater cauſe to exclude from him moral ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſuch as we feel them; ſince moral evil,
in the opinion of many, is much more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
above moral good than natural evil above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
good.</p>
               <p>But even though this ſhould not be allowed,
and though the virtue, which is in mankind,
ſhould be acknowledged much ſuperior to the
vice; yet ſo long as there is any vice at all in
the univerſe, it will very much puzzle you An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphites,
how to account for it. You
muſt aſſign a cauſe for it, without having recourſe
to the firſt cauſe. But as every effect muſt have
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0455900400:130"/>
a cauſe, and that cauſe another; you muſt either
carry on the progreſſion <hi>in infinitum,</hi> or reſt on
that original principle, who is the ultimate cauſe
of all things —</p>
               <p>Hold! Hold! cried DEMEA: Whither does
your imagination hurry you? I joined in alliance
with you, in order to prove the incomprehenſible
nature of the divine Being, and refute the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of CLEANTHES, who would meaſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing by a human rule and ſtandard. But
I now find you running into all the topics of the
greateſt libertines and infidels; and betraying
that holy cauſe, which you ſeemingly eſpouſed.
Are you ſecretly, then, a more dangerous enemy
than CLEANTHES himſelf?</p>
               <p>And are you ſo late in perceiving it? replied CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANTHES.
Believe me, DEMEA; your friend PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LO,
from the beginning, has been amuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at both our expence; and it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that the injudicious reaſoning of our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
theology has given him but too juſt a handle
of ridicule. The total infirmity of human reaſon,
the abſolute incomprehenſibility of the Divine
Nature, the great and univerſal miſery and ſtill
greater wickedneſs of men; theſe are ſtrange to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics
ſurely to be ſo fondly cheriſhed by orthodox
divines and doctors. In ages of ſtupidity and
ignorance, indeed, theſe principles may ſafely
be eſpouſed; and perhaps, no views of things
are more proper to promote ſuperſtition, than
ſuch as encourage the blind amazement, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0455900400:131"/>
and melancholy of mankind. But at
preſent. —</p>
               <p>Blame not ſo much, interpoſed PHILO, the
ignorance of theſe reverend gentlemen. They
know how to change their ſtyle with the times.
Formerly it was a moſt popular theological topic
to maintain, that human life was vanity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
and to exaggerate all the ills and pains,
which are incident to men. But of late years,
divines, we find, begin to retract this poſition,
and maintain, though ſtill with ſome heſitation,
that there are more goods than evils, more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
than pains, even in this life. When reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſtood entirely upon temper and education,
it was thought proper to encourage melancholy;
as indeed, mankind never have recourſe to ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
powers ſo readily as in that diſpoſition. But
as men have now learned to form principles, and
to draw conſequences, it is neceſſary to change
the batteries, and to make uſe of ſuch arguments
as will endure, at leaſt ſome ſcrutiny and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
This variation is the ſame (and from
the ſame cauſes) with that which I formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
with regard to Scepticiſm.</p>
               <p>Thus PHILO continued to the laſt his ſpirit of
oppoſition, and his cenſure of eſtabliſhed opinions.
But I could obſerve, that DEMEA did not at all
reliſh the latter part of the diſcourſe; and he
took occaſion ſoon after, on ſome pretence or
other, to leave the company.</p>

CLEANTHES, will have little inclination to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
this topic of diſcourſe, while you are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and to tell truth, PHILO, I ſhould rather
wiſh to reaſon with either of you apart on a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
ſo ſublime and intereſting. Your ſpirit of
controverſy, joined to your abhorrence of vulgar
ſuperſtition, carries you ſtrange lengths, when
engaged in an argument; and there is nothing
ſo ſacred and venerable, even in your own eyes,
which you ſpare on that occaſion.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, replied PHILO, that I am leſs
cautious on the ſubject of Natural Religion than
on any other; both becauſe I know that I can
never, on that head, corrupt the principles of
any man of common ſenſe, and becauſe no one,
I am confident, in whoſe eyes I appear a man of
common ſenſe, will ever miſtake my intentions.
You in particular, CLEANTHES, with whom I
live in unreſerved intimacy; you are ſenſible,
that, notwithſtanding the freedom of my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and my love of ſingular arguments, no
one has a deeper ſenſe of religion impreſſed on
his mind, or pays more profound adoration to
the divine Being, as he diſcovers himſelf to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0455900400:133"/>
in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice
of Nature. A purpoſe, an intention, a deſign
ſtrikes every where the moſt careleſs, the moſt
ſtupid thinker; and no man can be ſo hardened
in abſurd ſyſtems, as at all times to reject it.
<hi>That Nature does nothing in vain,</hi> is a maxim
eſtabliſhed in all the ſchools, merely from the
contemplation of the works of Nature, without
any religious purpoſe; and, from a firm convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its truth, an anatomiſt, who had obſerved
a new organ or canal, would never be ſatisfied,
till he had alſo diſcovered its uſe and intention.
One great foundation of the COPERNICAN ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
is the maxim, <hi>That Nature acts by the
ſimpleſt methods, and chuſes the moſt proper
means to any end;</hi> and aſtronomers often, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thinking of it, lay this ſtrong foundation of
piety and religion. The ſame thing is obſervable
in other parts of philoſophy: And thus all the
ſciences almoſt lead us inſenſibly to acknowledge
a firſt intelligent Author; and their authority is
often ſo much the greater, as they do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
profeſs that intention.</p>
               <p>It is with pleaſure I hear GALEN reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſtructure of the human body. The
anatomy of a man, ſays he<note n="*" place="bottom">De formatione foetus.</note>, diſcovers above
600 different muſcles; and whoever duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
theſe, will find, that in each of them Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
muſt have adjuſted at leaſt ten different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0455900400:134"/>
in order to attain the end which ſhe
propoſed; proper figure, juſt magnitude, right
diſpoſition of the ſeveral ends, upper and lower
poſition of the whole, the due inſertion of the
ſeveral nerves, veins, and arteries: So that in
the muſcles alone, above 6000 ſeveral views and
intentions muſt have been formed and executed.
The bones he calculates to be 284: The diſtinct
purpoſes, aimed at in the ſtructure of each, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
forty. What a prodigious diſplay of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
even in theſe ſimple and homogeneous
parts? But if we conſider the ſkin, ligaments,
veſſels, glandules, humours, the ſeveral limbs
and members of the body; how muſt our aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
riſe upon us, in proportion to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and intricacy of the parts ſo artificially ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted?
The farther we advance in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches,
we diſcover new ſcenes of art and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
But deſcry ſtill, at a diſtance, farther
ſcenes beyond our reach; in the fine internal
ſtructure of the parts, in the oeconomy of the
brain, in the fabric of the ſeminal veſſels. All
theſe artifices are repeated in every different ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of animal, with wonderful variety, and with
exact propriety, ſuited to the different intentions
of Nature, in framing each ſpecies. And if the
infidelity of GALEN, even when theſe natural
ſciences were ſtill imperfect, could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
ſuch ſtriking appearances; to what pitch
of pertinacious obſtinacy muſt a philoſopher in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0455900400:135"/>
this age have attained, who can now doubt of a
Supreme Intelligence?</p>
               <p>Could I meet with one of this ſpecies (who, I
thank God, are very rare) I would aſk him:
Suppoſing there were a God, who did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
himſelf immediately to our ſenſes; were
it poſſible for him to give ſtronger proofs of his
exiſtence, than what appear on the whole face
of Nature? What indeed could ſuch a divine
Being do, but copy the preſent oeconomy of
things; render many of his artifices ſo plain,
that no ſtupidity could miſtake them; afford
glimpſes of ſtill greater artifices, which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
his prodigious ſuperiority above our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
apprehenſions; and conceal altogether a great
many from ſuch imperfect creatures? Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all rules of juſt reaſoning, every fact
muſt paſs for undiſputed, when it is ſupported by
all the arguments, which its nature admits of;
even though theſe arguments be not, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
very numerous or forcible: How much
more, in the preſent caſe, where no human ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
can compute their number, and no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
eſtimate their cogency?</p>
               <p>I ſhall farther add, ſaid CLEANTHES, to what
you have ſo well urged, that one great advantage of
the principle of Theiſm, is, that it is the only ſyſtem
of coſmogony, which can be rendered intelligible
and complete, and yet can throughout preſerve a
ſtrong analogy to what we every day ſee and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in the world. The compariſon of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0455900400:136"/>
univerſe to a machine of human contrivance is ſo
obvious and natural, and is juſtified by ſo many
inſtances of order and deſign in Nature, that it
muſt immediately ſtrike all unprejudiced appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
and procure univerſal approbation.
Whoever attempts to weaken this theory, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend to ſucceed by eſtabliſhing in its place
any other, that is preciſe and determinate: It is
ſufficient for him, if he ſtart doubts and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and by remote and abſtract views of things,
reach that ſuſpenſe of judgement, which is here
the utmoſt boundary of his wiſhes. But beſides,
that this ſtate of mind is in itſelf unſatisfactory,
it can never be ſteadily maintained againſt ſuch
ſtriking appearances, as continually engage us
into the religious hypotheſis. A falſe, abſurd ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem,
human nature, from the force of prejudice,
is capable of adhering to, with obſtinacy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance:
But no ſyſtem at all, in oppoſition to
a theory, ſupported by ſtrong and obvious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
by natural propenſity, and by early educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I think it abſolutely impoſſible to maintain
or defend.</p>
               <p>So little, replied PHILO, do I eſteem this ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
of judgement in the preſent caſe to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that I am apt to ſuſpect there enters ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of a diſpute of words into this controverſy,
more than is uſually imagined. That the works
of Nature bear a great analogy to the productions
of art is evident; and according to all the rules
of good reaſoning, we ought to infer, if we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0455900400:137"/>
at all concerning them, that their cauſes have
a proportional analogy. But as there are alſo
conſiderable differences, we have reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a proportional difference in the cauſes; and
in particular ought to attribute a much higher
degree of power and energy to the ſupreme cauſe
than any we have ever obſerved in mankind.
Here then the exiſtence of a DEITY is plainly
aſcertained by reaſon; and if we make it a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
whether, on account of theſe analogies,
we can properly call him a <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>intelligence,</hi>
notwithſtanding the vaſt difference, which may
reaſonably be ſuppoſed between him and human
minds; what is this but a mere verbal controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy?
No man can deny the analogies between
the effects: To reſtrain ourſelves from enquiring
concerning the cauſes is ſcarcely poſſible: From
this enquiry, the legitimate concluſion is, that
the cauſes have alſo an analogy: And if we are
not contented with calling the firſt and ſupreme
cauſe a GOD or DEITY, but deſire to vary
the exprèſſion; what can we call him but MIND
or THOUGHT, to which he is juſtly ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to bear a conſiderable reſemblance?</p>
               <p>All men of ſound reaſon are diſguſted with
verbal diſputes, which abound ſo much in philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
and theological enquiries; and it is found,
that the only remedy for this abuſe muſt ariſe
from clear definitions, from the preciſion of thoſe
ideas which enter into any argument, and from
the ſtrict and uniform uſe of thoſe terms which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0455900400:138"/>
are employed. But there is a ſpecies of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,
which, from the very nature of language
and of human ideas, is involved in perpetual am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity,
and can never, by any precaution or
any definitions, be able to reach a reaſonable
certainty or preciſion. Theſe are the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
concerning the degrees of any quality or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.
Men may argue to all eternity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
HANNIBAL be a great, or a very great, or a
ſuperlatively great man, what degree of beauty
CLEOPATRA poſſeſſed, what epithet of praiſe LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VY
or THUCIDYDES is intitled to, without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the controverſy to any determination. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants
may here agree in their ſenſe, and differ in
the terms, or <hi>vice verſa;</hi> yet never be able to
define their terms, ſo as to enter into each others
meaning: Becauſe the degrees of theſe qualities
are not, like quantity or number, ſuſceptible of
any exact menſuration, which may be the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
in the controverſy. That the diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Theiſm is of this nature, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is merely verbal, or perhaps, if poſſible, ſtill
more incurably ambiguous, will appear upon the
ſlighteſt enquiry. I aſk the Theiſt, if he does
not allow, that there is a great and immeaſurable,
becauſe incomprehenſible, difference between the
<hi>human</hi> and the <hi>divine</hi> mind: The more pious
he is, the more readily will he aſſent to the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
and the more will he be diſpoſed to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
the difference: He will even aſſert, that the
difference is of a nature which cannot be too
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0455900400:139"/>
much magnified. I next turn to the Atheiſt,
who, I aſſert, is only nominally ſo, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
poſſibly be in earneſt; and I aſk him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from the coherence and apparent ſympathy
in all the parts of this world, there be not a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
degree of analogy among all the operations
of Nature, in every ſituation and in every age;
whether the rotting of a turnip, the generation of
an animal, and the ſtructure of human thought
be not energies that probably bear ſome remote
analogy to each other: It is impoſſible he can
deny it: He will readily acknowledge it. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained this conceſſion, I puſh him ſtill
farther in his retreat; and I aſk him, if it be not
probable, that the principle which firſt arranged,
and ſtill maintains order in this univerſe, bears
not alſo ſome remote inconceivable analogy to
the other operations of Nature, and among
the reſt to the oeconomy of human mind and
thought. However reluctant, he muſt give his
aſſent. Where then, cry I to both theſe anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts,
is the ſubject of your diſpute? The Theiſt
allows, that the original intelligence is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from human reaſon: The Atheiſt allows,
that the original principle of order bears ſome
remote analogy to it. Will you quarrel, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
about the degrees, and enter into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
which admits not of any preciſe mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor conſequently of any determination? If
you ſhould be ſo obſtinate, I ſhould not to be
ſurpriſed to find you inſenſibly change ſides;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0455900400:140"/>
while the Theiſt on the one hand exaggerates the
diſſimilarity between the Supreme Being, and
frail, imperfect, variable, fleeting, and mortal
creatures; and the Atheiſt on the other magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the analogy among all the operations of
Nature, in every period, every ſituation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
poſition. Conſider then, where the real
point of controverſy lies, and if you cannot lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
your diſputes, endeavour, at leaſt, to cure
yourſelves of your animoſity.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt alſo acknowledge, CLEAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THES,
that, as the works of Nature have a much
greater analogy to the effects of <hi>our</hi> art and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
than to thoſe of <hi>our</hi> benevolence and
juſtice; we have reaſon to infer that the natural
attributes of the Deity have a greater reſemblance
to thoſe of man, than his moral have to human
virtues. But what is the conſequence? Nothing
but this, that the moral qualities of man are
more defective in their kind than his natural
abilities. For as the Supreme Being is allowed
to be abſolutely and entirely perfect, whatever
differs moſt from him departs the fartheſt from
the ſupreme ſtandard of rectitude and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems evident, that the diſpute between the Sceptics and Dogmatiſts is entirely verbal, or at leaſt regards only the degrees of doubt and aſſurance, which we ought to indulge with regard to all reaſoning: And ſuch diſputes are commonly, at the bottom, verbal, and admit not of any preciſe determination. No phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Dogmatiſt denies, that there are difficulties both with regard to the ſenſes and to all ſcience; and that theſe difficulties are in a regular, logical method, abſolutely inſolveable. No Sceptic denies, that we lie under an abſolute neceſſity, notwithſtanding theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, of thinking, and believing, and reaſoning with regard to all kind of ſubjects, and even of frequently aſſenting with confidence and ſecurity. The only differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then, between theſe ſects, if they merit that name, is, that the Sceptic, from habit, caprice, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, inſiſts moſt on the difficulties; the Dogmatiſt, for like reaſons, on the neceſſity.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0455900400:141"/>
Theſe, CLEANTHES, are my unfeigned ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on this ſubject; and theſe ſentiments, you
know, I have ever cheriſhed and maintained.
But in proportion to my veneration for true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is my abhorrence of vulgar ſuperſtitions;
and I indulge a peculiar pleaſure, I confeſs, in
puſhing ſuch principles, ſometimes into abſurdity,
ſometimes into impiety. And you are ſenſible,
that all bigots, notwithſtanding their great aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the latter above the former, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
equally guilty of both.</p>
               <p>My inclination, replied CLEANTHES, lies, I
own, a contrary way. Religion, however cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
is ſtill better than no religion at all. The
doctrine of a future ſtate is ſo ſtrong and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
a ſecurity to morals, that we never ought to
abandon or neglect it. For if finite and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0455900400:142"/>
rewards and puniſhments have ſo great an
effect, as we daily find; how much greater muſt
be expected from ſuch as are infinite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</p>
               <p>How happens it then, ſaid PHILO, if vulgar
ſuperſtition be ſo ſalutary to ſociety, that all hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
abounds ſo much with accounts of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
conſequences on public aſſairs? Factions,
civil wars, perſecutions, ſubverſions of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
oppreſſion, ſlavery; theſe are the diſmal
conſequences which always attend its prevalency
over the minds of men. If the religious ſpirit
be ever mentioned in any hiſtorical narration, we
are ſure to meet afterwards with a detail of the
miſeries, which attend it. And no period of time
can be happier or more proſperous, than thoſe
in which it is never regarded, or heard of.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this obſervation, replied CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANTHES,
is obvious. The proper office of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is to regulate the heart of men, humanize
their conduct, infuſe the ſpirit of temperance,
order, and obedience; and as its operation is
ſilent, and only enforces the motives of morality
and juſtice, it is in danger of being overlooked,
and confounded with theſe other motives. When
it diſtinguiſhes itſelf, and acts as a ſeparate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
over men, it has departed from its proper
ſphere, and has become only a cover to faction
and ambition.</p>
               <p>And ſo will all religion, ſaid PHILO, except
the philoſophical and rational kind. Your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0455900400:143"/>
are more eaſily eluded than my facts.
The inference is not juſt, becauſe finite and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
rewards and puniſhments have ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
that therefore ſuch as are infinite and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
muſt have ſo much greater. Conſider, I
beſeech you, the attachment, which we have to
preſent things, and the little concern which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
for objects, ſo remote and uncertain. When
divines are declaiming againſt the common beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and conduct of the world, they always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
this principle as the ſtrongeſt imaginable
(which indeed it is) and deſcribe almoſt all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
kind as lying under the influence of it, and
ſunk into the deepeſt lethargy and unconcern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their religious intereſts. Yet theſe ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
when they refute their ſpeculative antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
ſuppoſe the motives of religion to be ſo
powerful, that, without them, it were impoſſible
for civil ſociety to ſubſiſt; nor are they aſhamed
of ſo palpable a contradiction. It is certain, from
experience, that the ſmalleſt grain of natural ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
and benevolence has more effect on mens
conduct, than the moſt pompous views, ſuggeſted
by theological theories and ſyſtems. A man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inclination works inceſſantly upon him; it is
for ever preſent to the mind; and mingles itſelf
with every view and conſideration: whereas reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
motives, where they act at all, operate on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by ſtarts and bounds; and it is ſcarcely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for them to become altogether habitual to
the mind. The force of the greateſt gravity, ſay
the philoſephers, is infinitely ſmall, in compariſon
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0455900400:144"/>
of that of the leaſt impulſe; yet it is certain, that
the ſmalleſt gravity will, in the end, prevail above
a great impulſe; becauſe no ſtrokes or blows can
be repeated with ſuch conſtancy as attraction and
gravitation.</p>
               <p>Another advantage of inclination: It engages
on its ſide all the wit and ingenuity of the mind;
and when ſet in oppoſition to religious principles,
ſeeks every method and art of eluding them:
In which it is almoſt always ſucceſsful. Who
can explain the heart of man, or account for
thoſe ſtrange ſalvos and excuſes, with which
people ſatisfy themſelves, when they follow their
inclinations, in oppoſition to their religious duty?
This is well underſtood in the world; and none
but fools ever repoſe leſs truſt in a man, becauſe
they hear, that, from ſtudy and philoſophy, he
has entertained ſome ſpeculative doubts with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to theological ſubjects. And when we have
to do with a man, who makes a great profeſſion
of religion and devotion; has this any other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
upon ſeveral, who paſs for prudent, than to
put them on their guard, leſt they be cheated
and deceived by him?</p>
               <p>We muſt farther conſider, that philoſophers,
who cultivate reaſon and reflection, ſtand leſs in
need of ſuch motives to keep them under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
of morals: and that the vulgar, who alone
may need them, are utterly incapable of ſo pure
a religion, as repreſents the Deity to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with nothing but virtue in human behaviour.
The recommendations to the Divinity are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0455900400:145"/>
ſuppoſed to be either frivolous obſervances, or
rapturous ecſtaſies, or a bigotted credulity. We
need not run back into antiquity, or wander into
remote regions, to find inſtances of this degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.
Amongſt ourſelves, ſome have been guilty
of that atrociouſneſs, unknown to the EGYPTIAN
and GRECIAN ſuperſtitions, of declaiming, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
terms, againſt morality, and repreſenting it
as a ſure forfeiture of the divine favour, if the
leaſt truſt or reliance be laid upon it.</p>
               <p>But even though ſuperſtition or enthuſiaſm
ſhould not put itſelf in direct oppoſition to mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
the very diverting of the attention, the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
up a new and frivolous ſpecies of merit, the
prepoſterous diſtribution, which it makes of praiſe
and blame; muſt have the moſt pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and weaken extremely mens attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the natural motives of juſtice and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Such a principle of action likewiſe, not being
any of the familiar motives of human conduct,
acts only by intervals on the temper, and muſt be
rouzed by continual efforts, in order to render
the pious zealot ſatisfied with his own conduct,
and make him fulfil his devotional taſk. Many
religious exerciſes are entered into with ſeeming
fervour, where the heart, at the time, feels cold
and languid: A habit of diſſimulation is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
contracted: and fraud and falſehood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the predominant principle. Hence the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that vulgar obſervation, that the higheſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0455900400:146"/>
zeal in religion and the deepeſt hypocriſy, ſo far
from being inconſiſtent, are often or commonly
united in the ſame individual character.</p>
               <p>The bad effects of ſuch habits, even in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
life, are eaſily imagined: but where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of religion are concerned, no morality can
be forcible enough to bind the enthuſiaſtic zealot.
The ſacredneſs of the cauſe ſanctifies every mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
which can be made uſe of to promote it.</p>
               <p>The ſteady attention alone to ſo important an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
as that of eternal ſalvation is apt to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the benevolent affections, and beget a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
contracted ſelfiſhneſs. And when ſuch a
temper is encouraged, it eaſily eludes all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
precepts of charity and benevolence.</p>
               <p>Thus the motives of vulgar ſuperſtition have no
great influence on general conduct; nor is their
operation very favourable to morality, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
where they predominate.</p>
               <p>Is there any maxim in politics more certain and
infallible, than that both the number and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of prieſts ſhould be confined within very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
limits, and that the civil magiſtrate ought,
for ever, to keep his <hi>faſces</hi> and <hi>axes</hi> from ſuch
dangerous hands? But if the ſpirit of popular
religion were ſo ſalutary to ſociety, a contrary
maxim ought to prevail. The greater number of
prieſts, and their greater authority and riches will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
augment the religious ſpirit. And though the
prieſts have the guidance of this ſpirit, why may
we not expect a ſuperior ſanctity of life, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0455900400:147"/>
greater benevolence and moderation, from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who are ſet apart for religion, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
inculcating it upon others, and who muſt
themſelves imbibe a greater ſhare of it? Whence
comes it then, that in fact, the utmoſt a wiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
can propoſe with regard to popular reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
is, as far as poſſible, to make a ſaving
game of it, and to prevent their pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
with regard to ſociety. Every expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
which he tries for ſo humble a purpoſe is
ſurrounded with inconveniencies. If he admits
only one religion among his ſubjects, he muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
to an uncertain proſpect of tranquillity,
every conſideration of public liberty, ſcience, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
induſtry, and even his own independency.
If he gives indulgence to ſeveral ſects, which is
the wiſer maxim, he muſt preſerve a very philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
indifference to all of them, and carefully
reſtrain the pretenſions of the prevailing ſect; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
he can expect nothing but endleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
quarrels, factions, perſecutions, and civil
commotions.</p>
               <p>True religion, I allow, has no ſuch pernicious
conſequences: but we muſt treat of religion, as
it has commonly been found in the world; nor
have I any thing to do with that ſpeculative tenet
of Theiſm, which, as it is a ſpecies of philoſophy,
muſt partake of the beneficial influence of that
principle, and at the ſame time muſt lie under a
like inconvenience, of being always confined to
very few perſons.</p>

Oaths are requiſite in all courts of judicature;
but it is a queſtion whether their authority ariſes
from any popular religion. 'Tis the ſolemnity and
importance of the occaſion, the regard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and the reflecting on the general inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts
of ſociety, which are the chief reſtraints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mankind. Cuſtom-houſe oaths and political
oaths are but little regarded even by ſome who
pretend to principles of honeſty and religion: and
a Quaker's aſſeveration is with us juſtly put upon
the ſame footing with the oath of any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
I know, that POLYBIUS<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 6. cap. 54.</note> aſcribes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
of GREEK faith to the prevalency of the
EPICUREAN philoſophy; but I know alſo, that
PUNIC faith had as bad a reputation in ancient
times, as IRISH evidence has in modern; though
we cannot account for theſe vulgar obſervations by
the ſame reaſon. Not to mention, that GREEK
faith was infamous before the riſe of the EPICU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REAN
philoſophy; and EURIPIDES<note n="†" place="bottom">Iphigenia in Tauride.</note>, in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
which I ſhall point out to you, has glanced a
remarkable ſtroke of ſatire againſt his nation,
with regard to this circumſtance.</p>
               <p>Take care, PHILO, replied CLEANTHES, take
care: puſh not matters too far: allow not your
zeal againſt falſe religion to undermine your vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the true. Forfeit not this principle, the
chief, the only great comfort in life; and our
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0455900400:149"/>
principal ſupport amidſt all the attacks of adverſe
fortune. The moſt agreeable reflection, which
it is poſſible for human imagination to ſuggeſt, is
that of genuine Theiſm, which repreſents us as
the workmanſhip of a Being perfectly good, wiſe,
and powerful; who created us for happineſs, and
who, having implanted in us immeaſureable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of good, will prolong our exiſtence to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
and will transfer us into an infinite varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſcenes, in order to ſatisfy thoſe deſires, and
render our felicity compleat and durable. Next
to ſuch a Being himſelf (if the compariſon be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed)
the happieſt lot which we can imagine, is
that of being under his guardianſhip and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Theſe appearances, ſaid PHILO, are moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
and alluring; and with regard to the true
philoſopher, they are more than appearances. But
it happens here, as in the former caſe, that, with
regard to the greater part of mankind, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
are deceitful, and that the terrors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
commonly prevail above its comforts.</p>
               <p>It is allowed, that men never have recourſe to
devotion ſo readily as when dejected with grief or
depreſſed with ſickneſs. Is not this a proof, that
the religious ſpirit is not ſo nearly allied to joy
as to ſorrow?</p>
               <p>But men, when afflicted, find conſolation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
replied CLEANTHES. Sometimes, ſaid
PHILO: but it is natural to imagine, that they
will form a notion of thoſe unknown beings, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0455900400:150"/>
to the preſent gloom and melancholy of their
temper, when they betake themſelves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of them. Accordingly, we find the
tremendous images to predominate in all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions;
and we ourſelves, after having employed
the moſt exalted expreſſion in our deſcriptions of
the Deity, fall into the flatteſt contradiction, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
that the damned are infinitely ſuperior
in number to the elect.</p>
               <p>I ſhall venture to affirm, that there never was a
popular religion, which repreſented the ſtate of
departed ſouls in ſuch a light, as would render it
eligible for human kind, that there ſhould be ſuch
a ſtate. Theſe fine models of religion are the
mere product of philoſophy. For as death lies
between the eye and the proſpect of futurity, that
event is ſo ſhocking to Nature, that it muſt throw
a gloom on all the regions, which lie beyond it;
and ſuggeſt to the generality of mankind the idea
of CERBERUS and furies; devils, and torrents of
fire and brimſtone.</p>
               <p>It is true; both fear and hope enter into reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
becauſe both theſe paſſions, at different
times, agitate the human mind, and each of them
forms a ſpecies of divinity, ſuitable to itſelf. But
when a man is in a chearful diſpoſition, he is fit
for buſineſs or company or entertainment of any
kind; and he naturally applies himſelf to theſe,
and thinks not of religion. When melancholy,
and dejected, he has nothing to do but brood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the terrors of the inviſible world, and to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0455900400:151"/>
plunge himſelf ſtill deeper in affliction. It may,
indeed, happen, that after he has, in this manner,
ingraved the religious opinions deep into his
thought and imagination, there may arrive a
change of health or circumſtances, which may
reſtore his good humour, and raiſing chearful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
of futurity, make him run into the other
extreme of joy and triumph. But ſtill it muſt be
acknowledged, that, as terror is the primary
principle of religion, it is the paſſion, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
predominates in it, and admits but of ſhort
intervals of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Not to mention, that theſe fits of exceſſive,
enthuſiaſtic joy, by exhauſting the ſpirits, always
prepare the way for equal fits of ſuperſtitious ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and dejection; nor is there any ſtate of mind
ſo happy as the calm and equable. But this ſtate,
it is impoſſible to ſupport, where a man thinks,
that he lies, in ſuch profound darkneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
between an eternity of happineſs and an
eternity of miſery. No wonder, that ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
disjoints the ordinary frame of the mind,
and throws it into the utmoſt confuſion. And
though that opinion is ſeldom ſo ſteady in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as to influence all the actions; yet is it apt
to make a conſiderable breach in the temper, and
to produce that gloom and melancholy, ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in all devout people.</p>
               <p>It is contrary to common ſenſe to entertain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
or terrors, upon account of any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
whatſoever, or to imagine that we run any
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0455900400:152"/>
riſk hereafter, by the freeſt uſe of our reaſon.
Such a ſentiment implies both an <hi>abſurdity</hi> and
an <hi>inconſiſtency.</hi> It is an abſurdity to believe that
the Deity has human paſſions, and one of the loweſt
of human paſſions, a reſtleſs appetite for applauſe.
It is an inconſiſtency to believe, that, ſince the
Deity has this human paſſion, he has not others
alſo; and in particular, a diſregard to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of creatures, ſo much inferior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To know God,</hi> ſays SENECA, <hi>is to worſhip
him.</hi> All other worſhip is indeed abſurd, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious,
and even impious. It degrades him
to the low condition of mankind, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with intreaty, ſolicitation, preſents, and
ſlattery. Yet is this impiety the ſmalleſt of which
ſuperſtition is guilty. Commonly, it depreſſes
the Deity far below the condition of mankind;
and repreſents him as a capricious daemon, who
exerciſes his power without reaſon and without
humanity! And were that divine Being diſpoſed
to be offended at the vices and follies of ſilly
mortals, who are his own workmanſhip; ill would
it ſurely fare with the votaries of moſt popular
ſuperſtitions. Nor would any of human race me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
his <hi>favor,</hi> but a very few, the philoſophical
Theiſts, who entertain, or rather indeed endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to entertain, ſuitable notions of his divine
perfections: As the only perſons, intitled to his
<hi>compaſſion</hi> and <hi>indulgence,</hi> would be the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Sceptics, a ſect almoſt equally rare, who,
from a natural diffidence of their own capacity,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0455900400:153"/>
ſuſpend, or endeavour to ſuſpend all judgement
with regard to ſuch ſublime and ſuch extraordinary
ſubjects.</p>
               <p>If the whole of Natural Theology, as ſome
people ſeem to maintain, reſolves itſelf into one
ſimple, though ſomewhat ambiguous, at leaſt
undefined propoſition, <hi>That the cauſe or cauſes
of order in the univerſe probably bear ſome
remote analogy to human intelligence:</hi> If this
propoſition be not capable of extenſion, variation,
or more particular explication: If it affords no
inference that affects human life, or can be the
ſource of any action or forbearance: And if the
analogy, imperfect as it is, can be carried no
farther than to the human intelligence; and
cannot be transferred, with any appearance of
probability, to the other qualities of the mind:
If this really be the caſe, what can the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive,
contemplative, and religious man do
more than give a plain, philoſophical aſſent to
the propoſition, as often as it occurs; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the arguments, on which it is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
exceed the objections, which lie againſt it?
Some aſtoniſhment indeed will naturally ariſe
from the greatneſs of the object: Some melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
from its obſcurity: Some contempt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
reaſon, that it can give no ſolution more
ſatisfactory with regard to ſo extraordinary and
magnificent a queſtion. But believe me, CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANTHES,
the moſt natural ſentiment, which a
well-diſpoſed mind will feel on this occaſion, is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0455900400:154"/>
a longing deſire and expectation, that heaven
would be pleaſed to diſſipate, at leaſt alleviate
this profound ignorance, by affording ſome more
particular revelation to mankind, and making diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of the nature, attributes, and operations
of the divine object of our faith. A perſon, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
with a juſt ſenſe of the imperfections of
natural reaſon, will fly to revealed truth with the
greateſt avidity: While the haughty Dogmatiſt,
perſuaded, that he can erect a complete ſyſtem
of Theology by the mere help of philoſophy,
diſdains any farther aid, and rejects this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
inſtructor. To be a philoſophical Sceptic
is, in a man of letters, the firſt and moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
ſtep towards being a ſound, believing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;
a propoſition, which I would willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to the attention of PAMPHILUS: And
I hope CLEANTHES will forgive me for interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo far in the education and inſtruction of his
pupil.</p>
               <p>CLEANTHES and PHILO purſued not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
much farther; and as nothing ever
made greater impreſſion on me, than all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
of that day; ſo, I confeſs, that, upon a
ſerious review of the whole, I cannot but think,
that PHILO's principles are more probable than
DEMEA's; but that thoſe of CLEANTHES ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
ſtill nearer to the truth.</p>
