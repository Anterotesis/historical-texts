            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>YOU are abſolutely too ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminately ſcrupulous, CARLISLE—what I propoſed was well meant. However, as your virtue is of a moſt obſtinate, anchoretical nature, which neither love nor friendſhip can make a voluptuous

               <head>LETTER LIV. From the Same to Sir ANDREW FLIGHT.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Dear ANDREW,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE ſtratagem takes: I have written the letter we projected, and it anſwers our expectation. He could not bear the idea—he was hurt—he could not believe his eyes—he would not do her ſuch a violence for the world— But you knew his virtue. I judge it is owing in a great degree to my caution in directing to you in a <hi>counterfeit</hi> hand, that has kept our correſpondence ſo long as private as we wiſhed it; for, had I written in my uſual character, a ſingle letter would have betrayed me
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0147101502:5"/>to CARLISLE, with whom I have lived on terms of abſolute intimacy for ten years, without his ever ſuſpecting me to be a <hi>jolly</hi> fellow. So eaſy is it for men of ſpirit, to impoſe upon theſe mighty good kind of men. Never, ſurely, was any thing half ſo a-propos, as his putting the Marchioneſs under my care—or rather my ſiſter's, who really thinks me as great a ſaint as CARLISLE himſelf. But to come to the point, it may certainly be contrived for you to take unto your boſom this Italian trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure—CARLISLE refuſes her, that's one plea—you are a fine fellow, that's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—you have money, that's greater than even the former: her paſſions are awake, that's number 4 in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: ſhe is married, and therefore above the folly of ſollicitation—num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 5—her conſtitution glows like the torrid zone—number 6—She abhors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0147101502:6"/>the Marquis—count <hi>nine</hi> for that. In ſhort, ſhe will, ſhe muſt, ſhe <hi>ſhall</hi> be your's—As to the arrival of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, do not apprehend any danger from that quarter: I have counteracted the contents of the letter from CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE, you may depend on it. It is, by your LASCELLES, ſo ordered, that, if he goes at all in ſearch of his <hi>Perdita,</hi> he will not direct his courſe to England, but to a very different quarter of the globe. I will prepare every other grand eſſential, even till your bed is dreſſed with roſes. In the mean time keep HEATHCOATE ignorant of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and continue to uſe, or rather to amuſe <hi>him,</hi> with the <hi>ridiculous</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from your play upon the HODSONS, DREWSONS, HEWSONS—what the plague is their vulgar name? He is a worthy fellow, but not fit for <hi>ſuch</hi> a plot as the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0147101502:7"/>preſent—therefore till the deed be done, keep him out of it.</p>
               <p>As to the Lady's beauty, depend on your old caterer for that. I have a hawk's eye at a pretty wench. To ſay the truth, the Marchioneſs is more to your taſte than any I have had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and friendſhip to recommend. Her eyes have juſt that fluid floating in them, and are exactly of that brilliant black you like: her noſe is turned to the perfection of <hi>your</hi> beauty—a little on the aquiline, and ſet off by a pair of brows ſo markingly expreſſive of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that you may depend upon them. Then her lips is firſt of that ſuperior order, without corpulence, and ſo full of majeſty, without haughtineſs, that moſt attaches you. Her boſom is finely filled, and riſes, as the poet emphatically
<pb facs="tcp:0147101502:8"/>terms it, "ſuing to be preſſed." Her arms, hands, fingers, are, likewiſe, all ſuited to you. But enough. She is to be the ſubject of a much cloſer criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm than it is even poſſible for me to give.</p>
               <p>Once more, however, let me charge you, by an old and ſerviceable friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, never to breathe the name of LASCELLES in any way not conſiſtent with every thing ſacred. You know my loſs of a damned fortune at one ſtroke of the die, firſt reduced me to this. As it was impoſſible to hold <hi>ſtill the elbow,</hi> ſomething was neceſſary to repair my miſchance, and, literally ſpeaking, keep me <hi>in play:</hi> beſides which, I was to live as I had ever been uſed to do; I was to be the ſame cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Two paths preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0147101502:9"/>the one led to the gallows by the way of purſe-gathering, the other to the accommodation of a friend, by the way of <hi>woman.</hi> I ſaw <hi>you,</hi> loved you, valued your <hi>health,</hi> and choſe the latter path. You know how I have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded: let the ample catalogue of your paſſions, gratified in every form, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of it. You <hi>only</hi> I ſerved: you only know me to be not abſolutely— a CARLISLE. I once more repeat to you the neceſſity of burning every letter, and every ſlip of paper you get from me, the moment it comes to hand: if a ſyllable at any time tranſpires, I am deſtroyed for ever: the conſequence of which irreparable injury is, that I muſt cut your throat. But keep our counſel and you ſhall be the very Jupiter of a ſeraglio.</p>

               <p>THOUGH BLESSINGBOURNE has not yet honoured my laſt draughts, and I have but juſt an hundred pieces about me, I, nevertheleſs, divide chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with you—My purſe is your's— How canſt talk ſo childiſhly about diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of ſecrets? Could you not have me cut into piecemeal by fathers, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, aunts, mothers, and couſins, if I were ridiculous enough to blab? I adore woman to <hi>pleaſe</hi> me, and men to <hi>laugh</hi> at. <hi>You</hi> very liberally ſupply
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0147101502:12"/>me with the one kind of gratification, HEATHCOATE with the other. Neither jars with the other's province, and I have money enough to ſupport you both. As to character, I like it as well as you, and except laughing at men, and lying with women, I ſolemnly declare I would not do a wrong thing for the world. But every man to his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions—thoſe are mine. You rejoice my heart with repeating to me in every letter the perſonal charms of CARLISLE's fair follower. 'Tis a confounded thing though, to conſider ſhe is ſo taken with CARLISLE; and yet to do him juſtice, he is an elegant, glorious fellow. Every day marks the goodneſs of his heart, and you would be an ingrateful dog to ſay a ſyllable againſt him. If you can <hi>prevent all riſque</hi> (for though you fight for me, I hate quarrels) I will be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with your ſucceſs by the middle of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0147101502:13"/>next month. In the mean time I have a game of my own to play. Juſt ſuch a one as I can manage without aſſiſtance. Not a ſnap of the finger of peril at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the whole enterpriſe. But, HEATHCOATE is my correſpondent in this adventure; it is not of <hi>importance</hi> enough for the ambitious GEORGE LASCELLES, whom even a Marchioneſs cannot deter from his attempts: the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my preſent humble aſpiring is only the wife of the moſt grazier-looking HAL. HEWSON. But mum, not a word more on a ſubject that does not belong to you. HEATHCOATE is the man for trifles and laugh. MEDWAY is, as uſual, the moſt ſullen raſcal in Europe; he was going to run me through the body the other day for toſſing down a tumbler of fair water, which (though I ſwear it was an accident) he inſiſted was done with an ill-natured deſign to ſpot
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0147101502:14"/>his waiſtcoat—CARLISLE, who is ever a peace-maker, interfered, or elſe I ſhould moſt likely have written to you from Elyſium.</p>

               <p>THOUGH your laſt reliſhed more, my dear LASCELLES, of the <hi>inconſiderate</hi> than I hope belongs to your character, yet it ſet my heart at reſt upon the ſubject of the Marchioneſs.</p>
               <p>Another ſtrange circumſtance has happened in this family. Two days after I had returned ſuch a reply to Mr. DE GREY's letter as appeared to me proper and conſiſtent, he put into my hands a letter from BLESSINGBOURNE, who had made formal overtures of marriage betwixt Miſs DE GREY and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT. Nothing ever
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0147101502:18"/>excited more real aſtoniſhment, for I had never once dreamt of a treaty coming from that quarter, knowing, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as I do, LUCIA's <hi>opinion</hi> of Sir ANDREW. The epiſtle was penned with all the title-ſwelled vanity connected with the BLESSINGBOURNE character; and coronets, creſts, and ſupporters, lions rampant, ſpread eagles, and fields azure, danced through every line. Having commented upon the ſtyle, with a good humour, which is above turning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of a man's infirmity into a cauſe of affront, Mr. DE GREY aſked me my opinion of the match—</p>
               <p>Pray heaven, I may never undergo ſo ſevere a trial as I ſuſtained in the proceſs of the following ſhort but moſt agonizing converſation, of which, you will have the more perfect idea from

                  <p>I have ever made you, my dear Mr. CARLISLE, my confident upon various occaſions: we have never canvaſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a <hi>love affair.</hi> Though you tell me <hi>you</hi> are to have a little more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſociety, before you venture upon a wife; yet I know you to have a very competent judgement of theſe things, becauſe you have ever been an accurate obſerver.

               <opener>
                  <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE importance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to both the young parties concerned, and the regard that is due to the natural inclinations, as to the acquired affections, are the apologies I have to offer for <hi>appearing</hi> to neglect a ſuitable return of acknowledgment for the honour of your Lordſhip's letter, and for the ample propoſals it contained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prior</hi> to the receipt of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's favour, I made ſome attempt to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0147101502:28"/>obtain the ſecret of my child's heart, and <hi>ſince,</hi> I have made a like attempt upon the heart of <hi>another</hi> perſon. Not, my Lord, that it is poſſible for me to prefer any gentleman to the nephew of the Earl of BLESSINGBOURNE, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſuſpected an affection ſubſiſting elſewhere: I think, my Lord, I have diſcovered a paſſion in my daughter, and a <hi>return</hi> of it in a certain young friend of mine, that may, poſſibly, grow, in a little time, into a circumſtance of eſſential conſequence.</p>
               <p>Within a few days I ſhall be more aſſured of this, and if my child proves to have a heart not pre-engaged, there can be no doubt of her ſoon becoming ſenſible of the great honour of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with ſo near a branch of the BLESSINGBOURNE family. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if it ſhould turn out that her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0147101502:29"/>are already poſſeſſed, it will appear obvious to your Lordſhip, that, as, in ſuch a caſe, ſhe cannot reward the tenderneſs of Sir ANDREW, ſhe can have no juſt title to the many dignities, and the immenſe fortunes which would follow ſuch a union.</p>
               <p>What I would invite then from your Lordſhip, is, a ſhort <hi>ſuſpenſion,</hi> that the matter may lie open. I again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, that a few days will naturally determine every thing. In the mean time, Sir ANDREW had better, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, remain unacquainted with our treaty, left it ſhould any way terminate to his diſſatisfaction. On <hi>my</hi> part, I will haſten the neceſſary diſcovery as much as in my power, although your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will eaſily imagine, a father's power, in a point of ſo much importance, is not very extenſive, when the father
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0147101502:30"/>is convinced of his child's integrity and diſcretion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be happy, my Lord, to hear, that the mode, I have ſubmitted to your Lordſhip, is crowned with your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
               <p>I <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> myſelf when I preſent my moſt humble compliments to the Counteſs, and I have the honour to be,</p>

Our viſit to Prudence Place was, principally, (out of an old friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and becauſe we thought your daughter a very decent, prudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) to <hi>promote a match</hi> between her and our nephew. We offered the moſt peculiar ſplendours, we offered lineal
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0147101502:32"/>honours—but we are deſired to wait the iſſue of <hi>another treaty.</hi> And pray, Sir, may we aſk, which or who it is amongſt your friends that ought to have the firſt offer in preference to the nephew and heir of the Earl of BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SINGBOURNE? I ſhall not mention the clear annual rent-roll of near fifty thouſand guineas a year, that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve to him, nor will I reſt my conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon the ſuperbeſt equipage; nor on the moſt magnificent ſeats in Europe; I confine myſelf to that illuſtrious line, into which the arms of your young Lady would be, if I may ſo ſay,—<hi>encoated.</hi> Every body can tell, Mr. DE GREY, I am not a boaſter; but, indeed, your tardy conduct borders ſomewhat upon incivility and diſreſpect. The Counteſs thinks ſo too. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we ſtill think your LUCIA would adorn a coronet; ſhe is her favourite.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0147101502:44"/>have within theſe few days been pleaſed, out of the benignity of your gracious ſelf, to ſpeak of my parts and perſon with ſome <hi>condeſcending complacency.</hi> This emboldens me, charming Madam, to ſay, that I think you are the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable piece of <hi>celeſtial workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the way of woman,</hi> that ever glowed under the aſtoniſhed eyes of a ſmall ſpectator—the natural conſequence of all this, Madam, is, that I am the humbleſt of your idolaters. I find, charming Madam, met in you, all the graces which Horace, Pliny, Homer, Virgil, and all other writers, ancient or modern, give to their ſeveral favourites. Your lips are ſweeter than thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Briſeis—your hair has more of the <hi>nitidus</hi> in it, than belonged to <hi>that</hi> which was the diſtinguiſhing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the divine Lyce's, and your <hi>air</hi> is conſiderably more ennobled than
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0147101502:45"/>that of the majeſtic Dido, Queen of Carthage, celebrated in the Aeneid written by Virgil.</p>
               <p>I ſhould never, charming Madam, have preſumed to addreſs ſuch ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſentiments to your exalted ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, were I not told that you prefer ſcientific ſuperiority to perſonal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Some perſons have been pleaſed to flatter me with poſſeſſing pretty fully the laurels of the <hi>firſt</hi> excellence; and as to the <hi>laſt,</hi> though nature hath not endowed me altogether with the graces of a CARLISLE, yet I find in my glaſs an alteration ſomewhat for the better every day, and hope in the end to <hi>ſtep</hi> without any kind of embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I take love-ſecrets to be amongſt the <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum</hi> of <hi>arduus rebus,</hi> and therefore I beg <hi>this</hi> may be confined

               <p>I HAVE not <hi>catched</hi> up gooſe feather for ſome time, Caſe why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was amind to gee time for the perfaction of the thing—I am got a woundly way ſince my laſt, and fancy a couple o'weeks more will finiſh me, that is, if Sir ANDREW ſticks cloſe by me, and I continues to <hi>practiſe</hi> the thing—Caſe why? <hi>practiſe</hi> makes parfect. To ſhew you that I ha' not been ſilent for nothing, I muſt let you know that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0147101502:48"/>I ha'n't chang'd ten words with HETT. this week. Caſe why? what's ſo far from the goe of the genteel gig, as to take notice of one's houſhold ſpouſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore company? 'ſpecially when a body is learning a <hi>touch of the times.</hi> To ſay truth, her lips looked develiſh ruddy <hi>t'other</hi> day, and I lent um a ſmack that echoed like waggon whip—for I could not help it, ſeeing that's ſhe's one of your dainty ones—but Sir ANDREW ſoon took me aſide, and ga' me a bit of a leſſon, and made me heartily aſhamed <hi>on't.</hi> I muſt let you know too, that I manage my little bit of a <hi>black ſack</hi> bobbiſhly, <hi>thof</hi> ribbons and flourri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diddles at ſides tickle nape o' one's neck conſumedly. Neither do I look ſo damn'd ugly as might be ſurſpected, regard to frenchfied foretop, and hair-bundles ſtuck out ſide of one's head. Fat of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0147101502:49"/>one's feace helps to take of hugeneſs of thing, which is but natural, ſeeing that <hi>one</hi> ſwells out <hi>t'other;</hi> and this makes feace and hair go, as a man may ſay, cheek-by-jowl without quarreling. It's pity, I'm given to <hi>ſweattin</hi> ſo much, as I find it don't do at all for a better-moſt perſon. I ha' got half dozen fine white handkerchiefs, but they're ſo cuſſed <hi>cambrickey</hi> that they are nothing in ſuch a <hi>grepe</hi> as mine, and I melt ſo this fmoaking weather, that I make '<hi>em</hi> every mother's ſon quite of a ſtew. Truth is, I begin to ſee, <hi>plite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> has, like every thing elſe, 'vantages and not 'vantages. When I was an ignoramus, I uſed to ſit in hall, or ride to hayfield with nightcap on head, or coloured handkerchief under hat for 'vantage of dripping in ſummertide; but no ſuch matter <hi>now;</hi> there's nothing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0147101502:50"/>ſo ill-bred as to be caught <hi>ſweattin;</hi> nay, more than that, 'tis quite out of the goe of the thing to <hi>mention</hi> the very word—'tis <hi>ſweattin</hi> with fellers of yeſterday, but, I find, 'tis <hi>presfieration</hi> with folks that are obliged to be <hi>deſunt.</hi> Sir ANDREW has been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What do <hi>you</hi> think of this, Eſquire? I hate purgers as I hate <hi>Lucifer—Satan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotus,</hi> as Gab calls him, but I would even <hi>potecarryarize</hi> myſelf for ſake of good breeding. To tell you the truth, there is ſort of a pleaſant comical <hi>nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at-all,</hi> in the life of your better-moſt genii, that I like mortationly well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. I warrant you, we went it round the great garden laſt night by moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0147101502:51"/>for two hours—none but your tip-top ſpecie, giggling and going it all the time—clack—clack—clack— yes—yes—yes—no—no—no—ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—ti-tum, ti-tum—ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-dum—Pardon me, Madam—pardon me, Miſs—<hi>Skuſe</hi> me, Sir—out with the foot—off with the hat—down with the breech—oh Eſquire—Eſquire HEATH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COATE, 'tis juſt the thing to a T. Laſt night, a little afore we went awalkin, I finiſhed <hi>giving the hand,</hi> as they call it—that is to ſay, getting a pretty lady over a gutter, for inſtance—or handin her over a puddle, or any thing the ſame way—allowing for th'alteration. I was once, before I had my fortune, low enough to ſay on ſuch <hi>caſſion,</hi> Come Bet, Het, Pol, Mol, Fan, Kit, or what not—allowing for the alteration— Come, gee us your fiſt, or tip us your
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0147101502:52"/>daddle—or lends hold o' your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, elſe may hap you may draggle the tail o' you in the water. Odds merciful miſerecordibus! as Gab ſays, no ſuch thing now by a million. <hi>Contrary</hi> ſo much, that one of the beſt things a better-moſt body <hi>can</hi> do, is to manage this matter as't ſhould be. Sir ANDREW himſelf, for ſample, is the greateſt dabſter in the world at it. For inſtance, <hi>there's</hi> he, <hi>there's</hi> a woman, and <hi>there's</hi> a croſſing, or a ſlippihin of waterwaſh; mayhap, we'll ſay, covered o'er with ſtepping ſtones—<hi>Now</hi> mark, Eſquire. Now comes your jemmy work—Well— get over they muſt—Indulge me, Miſs, or Madam, or my Lady, ſays he, allowing for th'alteration, with the favor of your fair hand—Sir, you are very <hi>plite.</hi> Well—what's next? Whew— ſhe's a t'other ſide. But how the miſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordibus
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0147101502:53"/>did ſhe get there I wonder, ſays you? Ah! there lies the point. Now I'll tell you. Firſt, Miſs, &amp;c. allowing for the alteration, tucks up piece of petticoat, ſets her pretty foot on ſtepping ſtone, ſhews dainty turn'd ancle, and is obliged, for the ſake of better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt breedin, to look a little as if ſhe was ſcar'd. Oh, Lord—ſays ſhe—Fear not, dear creature, divine angel, noble Madam, magnanimous Miſs, &amp;c. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for the alteration—fear nothing: then, Eſquire, he <hi>takes</hi> her hand, and <hi>takes</hi> her waiſt, and gis her a <hi>querrick,</hi> and they <hi>take</hi> a little bit of a thing 'twixt a hop and a jump, and he kiſſes her glove, and bends hinder-part, and bows head, and gets grin into's feace, and gis a bit of he, he, he, and ſhews his white, powder-purg'd grinders, and—and—'tis all over as neat as the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0147101502:54"/>Lady's leg: I ha' been a long while on this head, caſe 'tis almoſt half way clean up to the top genii, and Sir ANDREW 'clares 'pon his honour, no gentleman can do long without it—I ha' practis'd hugely, and I find I am up to every part of the puddle-pliteneſs, 'cept <hi>pouſing</hi> out hinder-part, and getting the grin. In aiming at the firſt matter, I ha' overſet one of Maſter DE GREY's china jars; for the thing is natural. I a'n't made quite ſo plite as I ſhould be 'bout the bottom of waiſt, or mayhap a little bit farder, ſo it's out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for me to wriggle't as little and limberly as ſuch a fine genteel, grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound-ham'd ſon of a gentleman as Sir ANDREW. The grin too is, as I juſt now ſaid, a hard thing to hit off. I can't, for ſoul of me, find out any thing to make a man laugh at getting
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0147101502:55"/>a woman over a cartret, and as to laughing where one don't ſee the joke, and where the thing is one almoſt nothing at all, I never could do it ſince I was born. Beſides, why? I am ſo cuſs'd <hi>covered</hi> about the gills, that if I could laugh as heartily as Sir ANDREW, 'twould not do, for my cheeks are too <hi>ſolidum firmus,</hi> if a man choſe to be learned, that it's enough to crack one's cheek furniture. I begin to day to learn to hold my tongue, or elſe talk about nothing, juſt as caſſion ſees fit. Hett gets on at a pure ſize. Sir AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DREW is giving her a lectur about airs, and high notions, fan-fluttering—hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and the like, now in the garden. Gab would do very well if his larning did not ſtand in his way. But we ſhall all be fit to be ſeen in a ſhort time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we go back; tho' as to coming
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0147101502:56"/>near Captain CARLISLE, that's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: yet I am ſure he never took any pains to be better-moſt, for every thing he does looks too eaſy for that—ſame thing with Miſs LUCIA.</p>

               <head>LETTER LXV. Mrs. HEWSON to Sir ANDREW FLIGHT.</head>
               <p>YOU aſſure me there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common, than for elegant people to write to each other, while they are under the ſame roof. You propoſe Lord and Lady SHUTTLECOCK, of your acquaintance, as examples, who, you tell me, when even they are chagrin'd, retire to their chambers, and keep the waiting-woman upon the hurry-ſcurry, with carrying notes of reproach to and fro, for ſeveral hours. Well, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, I wiſh the practice were univerſal, for it's mighty pretty; but <hi>then,</hi> indeed, it would become vulgar, and after that, it would <hi>nauſeate.</hi>

               <p>

Miſs LUCIA is ſo filled with ſpleen and megrim, that there is no getting an anſwer out of <hi>her.</hi> As to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with <hi>you,</hi> Sir ANDREW, whom I <hi>ſee</hi> every hour, what can I poſſibly have to ſay? If you wiſh me upon paper, as well as in perſon, to aſſure you, that I moſt cordially deteſt—deteſt <hi>every thing,</hi> that was once moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I <hi>will</hi> repeat it. No truth was ever clearer. Thoſe laſſes, who were favourites formerly in my village, are <hi>now</hi> as deteſtable to me as the village itſelf. I was once ſo great a novice as to find pleaſure in ſeeing my ruſtic neighbours walk in their Sunday dreſſes with their happy homely huſbands, and aſſemble in the ſhade. My fooliſh heart leapt as they ſat ſinging at their doors, or working at their windows—the very <hi>hollo—how-do-you,</hi> and <hi>hail-fellow-well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> had all attractions for me—The
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0147101502:59"/>ſmell of an hay-cart was pleaſure, and the ſight of an harveſt-home abſolute extacy. Note the alteration: I am wholly <hi>inverted</hi> in point of pleaſure: if, on my return to Helter-Skelter-Hall (which is fitting up) I feel any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from the ſight of people work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at windows, or ſinging at doors, it will be upon account of the pride of comparing <hi>their</hi> grovelling ſituation with <hi>mine:</hi> if I bear the noiſe of an hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart, it will be only from reflecting that my <hi>carriage-horſes</hi> (for ſuch I will have) ſhall fare the better for it.—If I can again reconcile to myſelf the preſence of lads and wenches <hi>dizened</hi> out in their fooliſh finery, it will only be for the joy of my ſweeping by them in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, that ſhall make them ſhy off with amazement: and if an harveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>home can ever more become ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it will only be from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0147101502:60"/>that it comes but once a year, and is then over for a twelvemonth— What other arguments can I uſe to convince you of my readineſs to adopt the modes and manners you ſpeak of?— As to Mr. HEWSON—he is a very good creature, and, when you have done with him, I ſhall love him better than ever. I cannot come into your opinion about the <hi>elopement</hi> you ſpeak of, be it ever ſo faſhionable; for I moſt aſſuredly <hi>do</hi> love Harry, and therefore it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Your aſſertions of <hi>tenderneſs</hi> to me, I am to take, you know, as mere effects of ſentiments which are to come <hi>of courſe,</hi> and as ſuch, they are very gallant. I ſhall not, indeed, be in any degree angry with you for the continuance of ſuch civilities in the way of promoting breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nor will I ſcruple any thing ſo accompliſhed a gentleman propoſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the elopement ſcheme, which, I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0147101502:61"/>again ſay, I can never conſent to. Any thing elſe I obey—nay, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced you of it. I do not ſpeak to Harry <hi>before company;</hi> I walk and ſtep as different as poſſible from what I did— I perceive the abſolute neceſſity of only occaſionally <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>ſeeing:</hi> I find every now and then as violent a deſire to faint, after a little decent walking, as Lady BLESSINGBOURNE herſelf.—I was almoſt expiring with the ſmell of violets laſt night <hi>in my room,</hi> though I uſed to doat on them. I can drink two glaſſes, and <hi>exactly</hi> another half, of wine and water—My dinners, of late, never digeſt, without a drop of rataſia. Thoſe drops, and reſtoratives, which I before never heard of but in <hi>books,</hi> are now a part of my exiſtence. I can bear no ſmells but ſuch as are <hi>artificial.</hi> Every thing <hi>natural</hi> actually turns upon my ſtomach. I uſed to riſe at ſix, I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0147101502:62"/>am now never up till near twelve.—I uſed to let my arms brave the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams—I now ſleep in gloves.—I uſed to defy the tan, I now never venture to ſtir without a ſhade.</p>
               <p>What would you wiſh more?</p>
               <p>My ſeven o'clock leſſon in LUCIA'S bower ſhall certainly not be forgotten. Mean time I have the great honour to be </p>

               <p>[Here, LASCELLES, he read, firſt, the Earl's, and then that of the Counteſs; upon which I had the raſhneſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim—I am not very apt to give way to my indignation; but, if I had here that <hi>ſcoundrel</hi> Lord, who can ſuffer his wife to inſult <hi>ſuch</hi> a woman as Miſs DE GREY, I'd twiſt his noſe off!]</p>
               <p>Oh, my dear LASCELLES, what a ſcene enſued. LUCIA turned pale— fixed her eyes upon me, in a kind of gentle reproach, and, after making an effort to retire, ſhe fell lifeleſs on the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0147101502:72"/>floor. God of Heaven! what did I feel at that moment?—She continued to riſe, only to faint again—I kneeled down—I caught her in my arms—My tears bathed her beautiful hand—I ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered under the weight of her, through enfeebling agony—Her dear lips qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered—I leaned down in my confuſion, even till I felt <hi>her</hi> cheek upon <hi>mine</hi>— I kiſſed the tears away—Her father was ſpeechleſs—She revived a little, but again relapſed, and without alarming any other part of the houſe (which her delicacy deſired might be the caſe) ſhe was conducted by Mr. DE GREY into her apartment. He is ſtill by her ſide—I went out in an agony, and I write this in the ſame ſituation. What can poſſibly be the meaning of all this?—Is <hi>Sir Andrew</hi> then at laſt the man?—Was ſhe ſo <hi>violently</hi> hurt at my menace againſt Lord BLESSINGBOUNE?
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0147101502:73"/>Does her paſſion extend to the very <hi>roots</hi> of the family?

               <p>THERE is infinite difficulty in the buſineſs—The Marchioneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to rave about her confinement, which, without the preſence of CARLISLE, is, ſhe ſays, inſupportable. She raves— ſhe ſtamps—ſhe inſiſts upon ſeeing him. Thirteen love letters have I deſtroyed ſince yeſterday morning, which ſhe imagines I was fool enough to ſend to CARLISLE—One written ſince upon the ſame ſubject, I preſerve juſt to ſend you by way of ſpecimen—All the glorious fire which ſhe expreſſes there, ſhall, in due time, burn for you—I— GEORGE
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0147101502:78"/>LASCELLES, the ſucceſsful, have ſaid it. My ſiſter has written twice to Miſs LUCIA of late—She always gives me her packets to put in the office—Not knowing but ſhe might ſay ſomething improper of the violent Marchioneſs, I threw the aforeſaid packets, not into the office, but into the fire—My head and hands are full, but the Lady is beyond every thing that was ever before ſeen on this ſide Heaven; and ſo I ſhall go through it with ſpirit for the ſake of my beloved Baronet.</p>
               <p>I have been thinking that a few new <hi>trinkets</hi> might ſoften a hard place or two;—ſhe came unaccommodated, you know. If you were to ſupply this matter, you might, perhaps, get her <hi>vanity</hi> in your favour—that is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful point gained. When <hi>afterwards</hi> ſhe came to know, that one of the

               <head>LETTER LXXV. Sir ANDREW FLIGHT to Mr. HEATH COATE.</head>
               <p>FIRE and faggot, HEATH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COATE, what a deſperate concluſion had my curſed love of laugh like to have brought me to! You remember my promiſe of turning uncle's love-letter to advantage—yes, faith, I had like to have made a pretty advantageous piece of buſineſs of it truly!—Within an hair's breadth of being drowned, that's all! Wanting ſome employment, as I told you, to amuſe the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt four o'clock, and Mrs. H—'s appointment, I muſt needs ſwagger away into the garden, where I knew
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0147101502:85"/>MEDWAY, the monſter, had juſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn with his angle. He was ſtanding with his eyes fixed intently upon the line, greedily devouring the dancing cork upon the ſtream, when I paſſed by on the oppoſite ſide, as not ſeeing him. The Earl's letter was in my hand—I appeared to be tickled to the ſoul. I affected to hold my ſides with the pain of laughing. I mentioned the name of <hi>Lady</hi> LUCIA thrice with rapture. My hero threw down his fiſhing-rod, and coming round to me with inconceivable violence, and the moſt ſcarlet viſage you ever beheld, even more <hi>a flame</hi> than a ſetting ſun, he cries out—Puppy, jackanapes — what did you frighten away my fiſh for? the largeſt carp that ever was ſeen nibbled that moment at my bait. Had it not been for you I ſhould have hooked him. What <hi>name,</hi> likewiſe, was that I heard you mention?—
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0147101502:86"/>it ſounded like LUCIA—What letter is that?—give it me this moment.—There is a plot on foot.—Huſh, my dear, give it me.</p>
               <p>If my uncle inſiſts upon it, OLLY, ſaid I, how the devil can I help it?</p>
               <p>Inſiſts upon what? replies he.</p>
               <p>Upon my being married, replied I.</p>
               <p>Married! to whom?</p>
               <p>To Miſs LUCIA, that <hi>is</hi>—<hi>Lady</hi> LUCIA that ſhall be—Counteſs of BLESSING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOURNE, that might have been— Dutcheſs of DOWNDERDALE, that may be!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What</hi> LUCIA? retorted the ſavage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0147101502:87"/>
Are there then more heavens than one heaven? — more LUCIA DE GREY's than one LUCIA DE GREY? ſaid I, with great intrepidity, taking ſnuff.</p>
               <p>I will read every ſyllable of that letter before I ſuffer you to move—I'll not be ſported with, Sir ANDREW.</p>
               <p>Nay, I am all upon honourable terms. There are no ſecrets—'Tis to be a public affair, OLLY. There is the letter for thy inſpection.</p>
               <p>He took it haſtily.</p>
               <p>While he was ſwallowing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, up came Captain CARLISLE, but, ſeeing us engaged, with his uſual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs was going to take another part of the garden. As if from ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret impulſe, that <hi>worſe</hi> was at hand,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0147101502:88"/>I beckoned him. He walked towards me.</p>
               <p>So then you are a fellow who make pretenſions to Miſs DE GREY, are you?</p>
               <p>I did, by no means, like a certain ill-look about his eyes, and therefore replied mildly—As to that, my dear OLLY, you may eaſily ſee it was all my uncle's doing—My uncle, you ſee—</p>
               <p>Your uncle be damned, replied he. Have you written to the Lady your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
               <p>Written to the Lady, my dear OLLY? written to the Lady?—why, as to a letter to the Lady—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0147101502:89"/>
Look ye, Sir ANDREW, as I know you don't run into danger, I ſhall not hurt you; but I muſt juſt inform you, caſually, that for equivocating you are a moſt abominable coward; and as to the matter of daring but to <hi>think</hi> of Miſs LUCIA—huſh—huſh—my dear, ſay no more upon that ſubject—I ſhall be ſatisfied with giving you to the fiſh, that's all—</p>
               <p>At the cloſe of this ſpeech, he caught hold of my arm, and would abſolutely have twirled me ſouſe into the pond, had not CARLISLE ran briſkly to my reſcue, and ſaved me from the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian's fury. He even told CARLISLE that he <hi>inſulted the fiſhes</hi> by ſaving me, and then walked away growling like a lion.—Poor CARLISLE ſeemed to be ſadly out of ſpirits, and when he had reſcued me, bowed with his wonted
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0147101502:90"/>elegance as if I had done <hi>him</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and walked dejectedly away.</p>
               <p>Such, HEATHCOATE, has been my <hi>fun</hi>—however, bad luck now, better hereafter, ſays the proverb. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that I have a bolder heart than you imagine, I will in deſpite of events go this moment to Mrs. H—; for my watch tells me 'tis exactly the time.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0147101502:94"/>my heart will break, if an alteration does not ſoon take place. <hi>Medway</hi> has again this minute been aiming his moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck myſteries at me.

               <p>WORSE and worſe, HEATH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COATE. Diſappointment again and again—Within the breadth of an hair of my perdition! The charming Mrs. HEWSON was at the bower two minutes after me.</p>
               <p>"Punctual as lovers to the moment ſworn," ſaid I—Well, charming pupil, are you now convinced that—</p>
               <p>I am convinced, ſaid ſhe, Sir AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DREW, that you ought to be contented with the many innocent freedoms I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0147101502:99"/>allow, without preſſing me to grant any thing criminal.</p>
               <p>Fie, child, when ſhall I perſuade thee to throw off entirely all thoſe Helter-Skelter-Hall ideas! — Believe me, women of true taſte and faſhion are above ſuch grovelling, homeſpun no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—Pleaſure is the word with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are truly polite; and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures I ſpeak of, are the moſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible. Take my word for it, you can only be a better ſort of Plebeian, unleſs you admit of them—Commence then, I implore you, the true woman of the <hi>ton</hi> at once, and make your Sir ANDREW happy—Nay then, if you refuſe me, I muſt take the faſhionable liberty gently to <hi>force</hi> compliance.</p>
               <p>To force compliance?—is it really your intention to diſhonour me?—Stand
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0147101502:100"/>off, Sir; you inſult me—I am certain it is no derogation to a woman of faſhion to be true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I caught hold of her again—</p>
               <p>She threw me from her, and gave a ſhriek—But what of that?—to make the matter ten times more terrible, her exclaiming arrouſed the ear of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>Carliſle,</hi> who was ſitting not far off. Never ſaw I ſuch manly menaces upon the brow of mortal. <hi>His look</hi> awed me more than the loudeſt threats of the terrific MEDWAY—Fie, Sir ANDREW, ſaid he, (when the Lady was walking off in pretty confuſion)—Is this well
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0147101502:101"/>concerted? Muſt you violate the laws of hoſpitality, at the very time that you ſeduce ſimplicity?—Fie upon it!—I am not one, Sir ANDREW, who pique my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon breaking in upon the private revellings of the libertine; but the ground you <hi>now</hi> tread upon, is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by belonging to <hi>your friend</hi>— If that, Sir, has no weight with you, I muſt add ſomething to its force, by informing you, that it is the property of <hi>my</hi> guardian.</p>
               <p>Saying this, he gave a gentle incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his head, and paſſed on.</p>
               <p>Oh, HEATHCOATE, HEATHCOATE, how diminutively was I ſhrunk up; how deſpicably was I dwindled after his departure? I ſat a little while under the agony of being the ſubject of my own ridicule. Annihilation juſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0147101502:102"/>then would have been a bleſſing, and I ſneaked into the houſe at laſt, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy a mite as even crawled upon the earth. To finiſh the matter, CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE treated me at ſupper, as if nothing had happened.</p>

               <p>THE fellows that hovered over my houſe have diſappeared, and I take up the pen again in more quiet to ſpeak upon the ſubject of the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away Marchioneſs. Ah, what a line of ſucceſs was I in, if my curſed paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had not made it crooked!—But there was no poſſibility of reſiſting the temptation—I ſaw the lovely creature in ſo many different poſitions—This moment ſhe dropt upon her knee to call bleſſings on her CARLISLE—the next ſhe ſprung up and execrated her fatal partiality. 'Twas in vain, under ſuch circumſtances, to attack her in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0147101502:104"/>my <hi>own</hi> perſon — She looked — ſhe loved—ſhe exiſted only in CARLISLE. What was to be done? <hi>Stratagem</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted — I counterfeited the hand of CARLISLE—made, in his name, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn appointment to meet her <hi>with Mr. Laſcelles' permiſſion</hi>—Enjoined a ſacred league of reciprocal ſilence during the midnight viſit—was punctual to the aſſignation—aſſumed the murmurs of CARLISLE'S mellifluous voice, and was received with rapture—Felicity was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me—<hi>but</hi> I was interrupted even at this very moment, juſt as the heaven of beauty was in proſpect; it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by ſome demon, that deteſts me, to occaſion a <hi>ſtumble</hi> as I was ſtepping along the apartment. By appointment, no lights were to be admitted—but this unfortunate ſtroke ſoon introduced <hi>one,</hi> and it was brought in the hand of my very ſiſter. The Marchioneſs was fixed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0147101502:105"/>in aſtoniſhment—I knew not which way to ſtir—The reſt is too painful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat—We left AUGUSTA in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but about an hour after we were departed, (my ſiſter to weep, and I to curſe myſelf) I heard ſomebody go ſoftly down ſtairs, and preſently tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering at the bars of the ſtreet-door— I followed the impulſe of my ſuſpicions, and hurried down alſo—You are not to be told it was the Marchioneſs—I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her to return—Without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to reply, ſhe proceeded in her efforts: upon my interfereing a ſecond time, ſhe exclaimed, in a voice, that at once terrified and commanded me—"Villain, ſet me at liberty!"—I was fool and idiot enough to <hi>obey</hi> her— She ruſhed into the ſtreet like lightning, and, being habited in her boy's apparel, ran along unſuſpected.</p>

CAROLINE does nothing but upbraid— One thing is, the Marchioneſs has no idea of CARLISLE's addreſs—At all events, I muſt weather it out—Perhaps all may again be well—Whatever folly you commit, let not the curſed luſts of the fleſh get the better of your policy.</p>

               <p>This fallacious piece of wickedneſs, under the appearance of tenderneſs, was delivered, as uſual, by the execrable LASCELLES—to what end, do you think?— Ah, my dear Signora, it is too ſhocking for your fancy ever to conjecture it! With a bluſh I tell you, that, on <hi>my

               <p>The apartment was dark—univerſal tremor ſhook every nerve as I heard the ſtep approach me—But the foot in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing encountered a chair—Sure it was placed there by Providence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the alarm which diſcovered to me—</p>
               <p>—I am overwhelmed in tears— which diſcovered the villany of <hi>Laſcelles</hi> and <hi>Carliſle.</hi> Yes, Viola, CARLISLE, the great, the elegant, the virtuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming CARLISLE—CARLISLE, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated to a mere pander—an ordinary wretch, who had agreed to ſacrifice the woman that adored him,—ſacrifice her to the man with whom he placed her
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0147101502:118"/>for protection!—But this is not half his baſeneſs;—this was not an enormity of ſufficient magnitude for the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious CARLISLE. When LASCELLES left the room (while I was hurrying on my boy's apparel, reſolved to eſcape)— I felt under my feet ſome papers, which my good genius directed me to take up. I got ſafe from the deteſted houſe, and wandered, a ſolitary wretch, in the ſtreets, I knew not whither. It could not yet be paſt two o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the watchmen, who are always abroad till after that hour, were ſtill upon their guard.

               <p>OH! my dear HEATHCOATE, I have ſpent half this day, in vain, to pacify my outrageous ſiſter, but to no purpoſe. Her curſed virtue plagues me to death. I have diſpatched a line to CARLISLE, which, I hope, will keep all quiet, till, by ſome means, I can recover the Marchioneſs—But, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I have not had courage to ſtep over my own threſhold ſince the curſed accident happened. One thing conſoles
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0147101502:127"/>me not a little: I perceive two papers, which I <hi>purpoſely wrote, forged,</hi> and <hi>dropt</hi> in AUGUSTA's apartment, are—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my expectation, as ſhe went away in the night — pickt up. As ſhe knows not CARLISLE's addreſs in the country, and is, I believe, without much money—ſhe may be tempted to return. On the other hand, if theſe ſcheming papers have fallen into my ſiſter CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROLINE's poſſeſſion, it is worſe ſtill.— However, at all events, I take care no letters ſhall go <hi>out</hi> or come <hi>into</hi> my houſe without my knowledge. Yet, I ſuſpect, that CAROLINE receives letters left for her at ſome other place—I know not what to think. The curſed uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty too of the Marquis's journey, either to <hi>my</hi> place of direction, or to CARLISLE's, much encreaſes my anxiety. Ah! HEATHCOATE, HEATHCOATE,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0147101502:128"/>what a hell it is to be liable to ſo many terrible apprehenſions! O guilt, guilt, guilt!</p>

I had, however, rather have it done, private, in the houſe, by the

I could have explained much conciſer, had I not choſen to make the appointment that is to determine the thing in <hi>writing.</hi> But there is too much company to ſpeak upon certain ſubjects that ſhall be nameleſs—huſh—huſh. The ſun gets up by four o'clock at this time of the year. Shall we riſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to morrow or the next day morning, and ſo contrive to have the buſineſs all done and over before the unconcerned part of the family are ſtirring? No noiſe—no noiſe—ſet your foot lightly— ſet your foot lightly—who's the wiſer, who's the wiſer?—huſh—huſh—huſh. You underſtand me. I will give you this with my own hand: do you do

               <head>LETTER XC. Captain CARLISLE to Mr. LASCELLES.</head>
               <p>PITY me, my dear LAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLES, pity me! Never—no, never was man ſo beſet by temptations! MEDWAY drew me, a little while ſince, in his fly way, to the very farthermoſt end of the room, and in the ſofteſt whiſper told me, that—O miſery, Mr. LASCELLES!—he ſhould have the ring upon LUCIA's finger in leſs than three days. "Huſh—huſh—ſaid he, 'tis the greateſt in the world—the poor girl is quite ſick upon my delay—She chides me with her looks, every time I ſee her. I cannot even have leiſure enough to put to death the uncle and nephew—
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0147101502:139"/>They muſt live till the beginning of the week—Pray pardon me for that, my dear friend. <hi>One</hi> would have <hi>ſunk</hi> if you could but have let him alone— Poor LUCIA, longer delay would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly kill her!—Three days has ſhe, already, kept her chamber—Mum— Mum—No noiſe—I have the thing that will ſettle the buſineſs in my pocket."</p>
               <p>This converſation was, like all his diſcourſe, in ſet, ſolemn ſentences—Mr. DE GREY, with an air of ſadneſs upon his venerable brow, came into the room, and we parted.</p>
               <p>Oh LASCELLES, help me to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage—help me to ſentiments which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſenſations of horror, that I may tranſmit to you ſome idea of the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that took hold of my heart, when
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0147101502:140"/>I beheld MEDWAY put, as if by ſtealth, into the hand of Mr. DE GREY, a paper that ſeemed to be ſtampt with ſeveral ſeals!—Though it was too much like a <hi>letter,</hi> and too <hi>ſmall</hi> to be a ſettlement, yet my fancy ſuggeſted it was ſome <hi>deed</hi> ſufficient to <hi>my</hi> deſtruction—</p>
               <p>Had not water been at hand, I ſhould certainly have dropt.</p>
               <p>To ſwell the circumſtance, both the HEWSONS and Sir ANDREW FLIGHT were in the room.</p>
               <p>This was not all. Mr. DE GREY ſeemed to receive the packet with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and retired rather abrupter than he was wont to do, when he leaves a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0147101502:141"/>
MEDWAY hummed a love ſonnet, and capered about the room; paſſing by me every now and then with a wink.</p>
               <p>The trial was too hard to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. I withdrew. What was to be done? It was plain that Sir ANDREW's affair was out of the queſtion; <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way—Medway only,</hi> was the man. For <hi>Medway</hi>—the cruel—(ah! why do I call her cruel?)—the <hi>charming</hi> LUCIA DE GREY was now languiſhing in her chamber: for <hi>him,</hi> ſhe had been long indiſpoſed—<hi>his</hi> image it was that filled her thoughts—<hi>his</hi> perſon it was that charmed her eyes—<hi>he</hi> only was—to— to—</p>
               <p>I loſt my ſenſes, LASCELLES—and I now loſe them again at the recollection of what followed theſe reflections.</p>

                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0147101502:142"/>
LUCIA DE GREY herſelf appeared. She came tottering from her apartment, with a countenance, which, although ever lovely, denoted infinite emotion.</p>
               <p>Oh Mr. CARLISLE, ſaid ſhe, lifting up both her hands, what is doing above in the library?</p>
               <p>Doing, my dear Miſs DE GREY, replied I, (as we walked into the garden, whither ſhe was going to air) you frighten me—why—<hi>what is</hi> doing?</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0147101502:144"/>but I aſk pardon, Madam, my zeal has hurried me into language which, as things are circumſtanced, muſt naturally offend you.</p>
               <p>It does, indeed, Sir—It ſeems ſtudied to do <hi>more</hi> than offend me—to break my heart.</p>
               <p>Your heart, Miſs DE GREY!—I have done—I ſhall—I, I—have done—I wiſh you—I wiſh you, very happy— Indeed I do—Upon—upon my ſoul, Madam, I do!—</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0147101502:145"/>has been ſuch an <hi>old friend</hi>—oh, Mr. CARLISLE, how can you uſe me ſo?</p>
               <p>Upon theſe words ſhe went again into the houſe in anger and agony inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. But who could ever have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that her paſſion for that ſtrange man, ſhould have made her ſo ſenſible of the ſlighteſt impreſſion againſt his character?

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0147101502:161"/>eſcape—Though my ſiſter kneels down and preſſes her, with tears, to eat, ſhe moſt obſtinately refuſes. What a violent woman! I gave it out to two fellows, whom I had upon the ſcout, that ſhe was a relation of mine, hurt in her ſenſes, who had broke from us. Her behaviour to them, on being ſeized, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this; for, in getting her up ſtairs to her old apartment, ſhe took a little pocket-knife from her ſide, and aimed it with full force at one of the men's throats. I own I am ſorry to ſee her in this ſituation, though I had rather have her <hi>any way,</hi> than have her to <hi>look for.</hi> CARLISLE would certainly have taken vengeance. <hi>Now</hi> all may be well again.

Oh, my LAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLES, I am lighter than the air—the dead weight is taken from my boſom— I have neither a thorn in my heart, nor a wrinkle on my brow. Though the path that led to this paradiſe was not without brambles that <hi>obſtructed,</hi> it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, at <hi>laſt,</hi> the ſmootheſt, the moſt lawny, as well as the moſt roſy proſpect in the world.</p>

You ſhall hear.</p>
               <p>Unable, any longer, to bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing perplexities of my ſituation, I wrote a letter of excuſe to Mr. DE GREY for a week's abſence, and went to pay my farewell reſpects to LUCIA.</p>
               <p>Suggeſting what might be the ſtate of my feelings at the cloſe of ſuch an interview, I took care to have my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage waiting for me at the door the moment I left her apartment—nor did I even <hi>allow</hi> myſelf this pleaſure of entering her apartment at all, till I had pre-invited <hi>Mr. De Grey</hi> to be preſent, and even till I had <hi>apprized Mr. Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> of the ſole purpoſe of my viſit.</p>
               <p>I meant only to make—my <hi>heart ach</hi>—and withdraw.—Oh human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!—</p>

                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0147101502:165"/>
Mr. DE GREY opened the door to me; he had ſcarce entered himſelf— Behind him ſtood—MEDWAY, making his ſalutations to LUCIA, who, upon ſeeing me advance, put on, as of late had been uſual, a ſort of <hi>anxiouſneſs,</hi> which I have been but too apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue in my <hi>disfavour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LUCIA DE GREY looked, as if ſhe thought it a <hi>ſtrange meeting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Pray ſit down, gentlemen," ſaid ſhe, in a fluttering manner—"Pray ſit down."</p>
               <p>Her father took her by the hand. I was preparing to ſpeak on the ſubject of my departure—but could, for the ſoul of me, get no farther than—"I am come, Madam—I am come, Miſs DE GREY—I am—I am come"—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0147101502:166"/>
"Very true, Captain," replied Mr. DE GREY, taking me up briſkly, "you are come extremely apropos—you are come juſt in time to be a witneſs to—"</p>
               <p>Oh! LASCELLES, my perverting fancy caught at the only wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſentiment, and I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him by exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"Excuſe me, my dear Mr. DE GREY—pray excuſe me—I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate not only my leiſure, but my life to the wiſhes of your family—but to be a <hi>witneſs</hi>—to be a <hi>witneſs,</hi> my good Sir, upon ſo intereſting an occaſion— is—is—is—indeed, I could not be of any ſervice."</p>
               <p>"Service, Mr. CARLISLE," ſaid MEDWAY—"there is no ſervice in the caſe—the only ſervice you can be of in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0147101502:167"/>promoting the deſign of our viſit to this young Lady, is to be a witneſs that I have had all the reaſon in the world to ſuppoſe I was beloved by her."</p>
               <p>"Was it ever queſtioned, Mr. MED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WAY," ſaid I?</p>
               <p>"Queſtioned,"—retorted Miſs DE GREY—"queſtioned, Mr. CARLISLE— beloved by me—Mr. MEDWAY beloved by me!"</p>
               <p>"<hi>Yes,</hi> Madam, <hi>I,</hi>"—ſaid MEDWAY?</p>
               <p>"Now then we come to the point," replied Mr. DE GREY—</p>
               <p>"Perhaps theſe explanations," ſaid I, "may be improper before me—I certainly intrude—Family affairs are
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0147101502:168"/>ſacred—I beg permiſſion to withdraw— Had I known you were upon buſineſs of ſo much delicacy"—</p>
               <p>"Stay, Mr. CARLISLE," anſwered LUCIA, with more firmneſs than is uſual to ſuch extreme delicacy as her's— "it is a juſtice you <hi>owe me</hi> to ſtay, Sir—With regard to <hi>you,</hi> Mr. MED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WAY, I beg to know upon what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction you found the aſtoniſhing fact you charge me with?"</p>
               <p>"<hi>Aſtoniſhing</hi> fact, Madam," rejoined MEDWAY—"Is it not clear? have I not fed my fond heart with this idea many months?—did you not always meet me with a ſmile?—have I not a thouſand times ſaid, that you was made to be the beſt wife in the world?—have I not been ready to murder any man that ſhould dare to look ſtedfaſtly at
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0147101502:169"/>you? Has not your father heard me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that I would loſe my blood in your ſervice?"</p>
               <p>Here LUCIA lifted up her hands again.</p>
               <p>"I grant all this, my dear MEDWAY," ſaid Mr. DE GREY, "but ſurely, this is no foundation for a paſſion. LUCIA ſmiles whenever ſhe meets any of her friends. It is a complacency that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to her character—it belongs even to her face: her features are made for giving welcome to her father's friends— <hi>Such</hi> Mr. MEDWAY moſt certainly <hi>is.</hi>"</p>
               <p>"Lookee, Mr. DE GREY," replied MEDWAY—"huſh — huſh — no noiſe about this buſineſs—I am no talker. I have been intending to make your
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0147101502:170"/>daughter my wife a long while. I thought both you and ſhe knew plain enough my meaning, eſpecially as I was exceeding cautious leaſt it ſhould be known to any body elſe—which I deſpiſe. I took the affair for granted. It ſeems I am deceived. Nobody underſtood my meaning but myſelf—The buſineſs is eaſily brought to an iſſue. Here's the upſhot. Do you now, Mr. DE GREY, approve of my beginning more explicit overtures?"</p>
               <p>"That queſtion," ſaid Mr. DE GREY, "is firſt to be ſubmitted to my daughter. You are a worthy man, and I here declare I have no objection to <hi>any</hi> gentleman, upon whom I have any ſolid reaſons to believe <hi>ſhe</hi> places her affections."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0147101502:171"/>
"Give me your hand," cried MED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WAY; "you ſpeak fairly—I love honour better than life—life—it <hi>is</hi> MY heaven— Well, Miſs LUCIA, now is the time. Every thing reſts with you?"</p>
               <p>Gueſs, if you can, LASCELLES, what I underwent at this moment! My heart was at my lips.</p>
               <p>"Since it is incumbent on me to ſpeak," ſaid the beautiful trembler, "I muſt confeſs, that, though there is no man I more eſteem than Mr. MEDWAY, as a <hi>friend;</hi> yet, yet, in the light of— of—a <hi>lover,</hi> I—I—cannot ſay that— that—Pray be not diſpleaſed with me, if I ſay that—"</p>
               <p>"Enough ſaid, enough ſaid—huſh— huſh—I'm only angry," ſaid MEDWAY,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0147101502:172"/>"that you did not tell me ſo before; but—no noiſe—I ſee it was partly my own fault. Give me a buſs—you are a good girl—a bad one at a <hi>hint,</hi> tho'— huſh—huſh—you are a bad one at a hint. Give me your hand, Mr. DE GREY. I thought I was acting the right part—But I am too old, and too odd a fellow to die of diſappointment, ſo all I have farther to ſay on the ſubject is this; don't ſpeak of my affair below— Let us ſeparate—Let us go down a little <hi>after</hi> one another—Who's the wiſer? who's the wiſer?"</p>
               <p>"Another moment, if you pleaſe," ſaid Mr. DE GREY, (riſing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to LUCIA, whom in the courſe of the converſation he had left)—"Since matters have gone thus far, and we are all friends together; tell me, LUCIA,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0147101502:173"/>if you think there is any <hi>other</hi> perſon who may be going on in the ſame <hi>miſtake.</hi> If ſo, we may rectify it in time. Do you imagine any other, in <hi>this family,</hi> for inſtance, lays claim to your tenderneſs, my dear?"</p>
               <p>My God, LASCELLES, what a queſtion!</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, Sir," anſwered LUCIA, with a ſigh.</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes," rejoined MEDWAY, "that bit of a Baronet, Sir ANDREW FLIGHT."</p>
               <p>"Sir ANDREW FLIGHT!" cried ſhe haſtily—"the matter was not <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> with ſo <hi>worthy</hi> a man as Mr. MEDWAY, but ſurely Sir ANDREW FLIGHT could never—"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0147101502:174"/>
"Madam," returned MEDWAY, "I was about to have jerked him into a fiſh pond upon that account. If you have ever any thing to ſay to ſuch a fellow as that, I'll never forgive you."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it may be in <hi>your</hi> power, Mr. CARLISLE," ſaid Mr. DE GREY, (coming round to me) "to help us to another upon the lover's liſt."</p>
               <p>Think of my confuſion, LASCELLES! after great heſitation I ſpoke as follows, while LUCIA went firſt to one window then to the other, as if taking different views of the garden.</p>
               <p>"I muſt own, Sir, it does not ſeem difficult for me to mention another of Miſs DE GREY's admirers. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty would be in finding a perſon of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0147101502:175"/>her acquaintance who did <hi>not</hi> come under that character."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, CARLISLE, no noiſe— no noiſe," ſaid MEDWAY, "you have <hi>yourſelf</hi> been her admirer any time theſe—"</p>
               <p>Here LUCIA turned round, with a face blooming with a thouſand bluſhes.</p>
               <p>"Mr. CARLISLE <hi>my</hi> admirer, Mr. MEDWAY?—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Miſs DE GREY, Mr. CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE has, to my knowledge, been your admirer before he went to Italy. You may thank me—for now I ſee the whole train of my miſtake—that he has pined and grieved, and—"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0147101502:176"/>
"For heaven's ſake, Mr. MEDWAY!" ſaid LUCIA.</p>
               <p>"CLEMENT," ſaid Mr. DE GREY, "MEDWAY is too hard upon you: he has had a ſlight ſcratch of the paſſion himſelf, and he wants to make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you have had a wound too. But come, Mr. MEDWAY, I have ſomething to ſhew you in the library—ſuch a fiſhing-pole as, perhaps, you never ſaw."</p>
               <p>They both went out of the room hand-in-hand — LUCIA attempted to follow.</p>
               <p>"And <hi>muſt</hi> you go then, Miſs DE GREY?" ſaid I.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0147101502:177"/>
"What a bleſſing I ſhould have deemed it, Miſs DE GREY, if this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery had been made before I went to Italy!"</p>
               <p>"What did you ſay, Mr. CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE?—Italy—Good God!—Has your Italian attractions then—"</p>
               <p>"O LUCIA!—LUCIA!

               <head>LETTER C. Mr. LASCELLES to Mr. HEATHCOATE.</head>
               <p>A MISERY, and a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune more extreme than before, hath fallen upon me—The Marquis is come— The Marchioneſs is every thing but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely diſtracted—My ſiſter is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in tears! I am plunging in the abyſs of deſpair. My whole family is in ruins.</p>
               <p>A violent thundering at my door laſt night, and almoſt towards the zenith of it, announced the impatience of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body who had authority to diſturb us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0147101502:182"/>
Ah! HEATHCOATE, conſcious guilt at that moment emaſculated my uſual hardihood; I felt my heart convulſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my boſom, and the ſhameful drops of <hi>fear</hi> were upon my brow. Flying then from my bed, wrapt up only in a <hi>robe de chambre,</hi> I charged my ſervants to deny me—gave my ſiſter the like injunction, and then ſtole, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious terror, into a kind of lumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room at the top of the houſe, that I might eſcape even the <hi>voice</hi> of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer. To this precaution, probably, am I indebted for my life—Who, HEATHCOATE, can <hi>expect</hi> to conquer the man whom he has <hi>wronged?</hi> For money, I am mercenary enough to fight, but with the weight of <hi>crimes</hi> upon the heart, one's intrepidity hath no room to play.</p>

                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0147101502:183"/>
The knocking being for ſome time repeated, and every repetition with more vehemence, admittance was at length given.</p>
               <p>Oh theſe high-ſpirited foreigners! No ſooner was he entered, than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, in a tone of implicit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, his violated wife. He did not, it ſeems, wait any reply. He did not wait even long enough for obedience. In diſregard of every thing that looked like ceremony, he flew up ſtairs—ruſhed from one room to another; and found at laſt the object of his ſearch. I heard the ſhriek of the Marchioneſs's amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even to the remoteſt corner of my hiding hole. Barbarous man! aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned woman! re-echoed thro' the cave. I was witneſs to the clamourous denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0147101502:184"/>of death upon CARLISLE and myſelf. I was witneſs that the Marquis was in poſſeſſion of CARLISLE's addreſs— the name of DE GREY, and even of LUCIA, were articulated with curſes of vengeance—With execrations, ſtill ſtronger, was all future connexion with the Marchioneſs renounced; and he ruſhed down the ſtair-caſe at laſt, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never more to cloſe his eyes till his revenge, as far as it could be had in <hi>this</hi> world (that was his expreſſion) was compleat.</p>
               <p>Since his departure, I have crept from my ſanctuary, and tried, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tremor, to gain admittance to the apartment of AUGUSTA. She has drawn a triple bolt acroſs the door— She will not ſpeak—My ſiſter is on the

               <p>AT length, my dear Miſs LASCELLES, the long line of myſteries is unravelled. Yes, my friend, the cauſe of your poor LUCIA's anxiety is now no longer problematical. Alas! it is made but too manifeſt! So there IS an Italian attachment I find after all! the warm heart of Captain CARLISLE could not, it ſeems, remain inſenſible of beauty, blooming under ſo bright a ſun. Nay, his paſſion, to do him juſtice, is of the moſt faſhionable kind. A <hi>wife</hi> has been his object: to give him greater eclat—the wife of his <hi>friend</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0147101502:190"/>
Oh, Miſs LASCELLES, I have not patience to go on—Oh that I could find—that I could but have a ſingle glance of this all-accompliſhed Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of N—! <hi>That</hi> is his dulcinea— She muſt be <hi>very</hi> handſome—ſhe muſt, certainly, ſurpaſs all the ladies on this ſide the line—Heavens, Miſs LAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLES, what an angel ſhe muſt be!— <hi>I</hi> muſt be a—but why do I talk of ſuch a deformity as myſelf! The ſuperior charms of the Marchioneſs—Oh, Miſs LASCELLES, that I could ſee her!</p>
               <p>But from whom do you ſuppoſe I received this illuſtrious intelligence?— even from the injured huſband himſelf. The letter of the Marquis is at this minute before me. My eye, even now, fixes upon that part of the epiſtle where—</p>

               <p>What meaſure ſhall I take? There is no time for choice or deliberation— a few hours only are between Captain CARLISLE and Death! — Death! — Death!—Oh, Miſs LASCELLES, I am diſtracted!</p>

               <p>SUCH is my joy ſince this happy alteration in the poſture of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at Prudence Place, my LASCELLES, that it is impoſſible for me to leave it again till the lovelieſt of women is firmly and irrevocably mine. I have fixed in <hi>my</hi> mind Saturday next for that bleſſed change in my condition; againſt which time I could wiſh to preſent the lovely LUCIA DE GREY with certain little elegancies that might ſhew <hi>my attention,</hi> though they can never add any thing

               <p>WHO, CAROLINE, can ſay unto miſery, thus far ſhalt thou go and no farther? I am more compleatly a wretch than ever.</p>
               <p>Soon after I had ſent away my laſt, CARLISLE came to pay me the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the day. He paid them with the beſt diſſembled tenderneſs you ever ſaw. He congratulated his heart upon the return of its tranquillity—He took my hand, and carried it with a zeal
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0147101502:195"/>which any woman might have taken for real, to his lips. He even talked, with blooming cheeks, upon the day of marriage: he pretended that he ſuffered unutterable things by delay. He ſaid, he ſhould never be happy till I was his. He abſolutely carried the cruel joke ſo far as to aſſert, he had commiſſioned your brother to purchaſe decorations for the joyful day!</p>
               <p>This ſeemed a proper opportunity to draw up the curtain, and diſcover the firſt ſcene of his farce. Oh what a dialogue!</p>
               <p>"I think, Mr. CARLISLE, you wrote ſome letters to my father from the houſe of a Marquis of N. during your reſidence at Rome?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0147101502:196"/>
"I did, Madam—I did, my dear LUCIA."</p>
               <p>"You ſpoke, I think, occaſionally, of the Marchioneſs his Lady?"</p>
               <p>"I did. She is a charming woman. Except LUCIA DE GREY, I never ſaw a lovelier."</p>
               <p>"'Pſhaw, your exception is a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Is ſhe ſenſible?"</p>
               <p>"She is, beyond imagination."</p>
               <p>"You were upon very good terms, no doubt?"</p>
               <p>"The beſt in the world. I have ſat the whole evening converſing with her upon ſubjects even of ſcience."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0147101502:197"/>
"A <hi>learned</hi> Lady then!"</p>
               <p>"Rather <hi>accompliſhed</hi> than learned: ſhe wants, however, that gentleneſs which diſtinguiſhes the lovely LUCIA DE GREY."</p>
               <p>"You left her, certainly, with regret?"</p>
               <p>"Had it not been for LUCIA DE GREY, whom I fondly expected to ſee, it might have been ſo."</p>
               <p>"Is ſhe ſtill at Rome, Captain CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE?"</p>
               <p>"I fancy not, LUCIA. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis viſits in Rome, but his home is Paris. Though the Marchioneſs her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is a native of England, and I had the pleaſure to revive her acquaintance
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0147101502:198"/>with her own language ſo much, that ſhe now ſpeaks it as fluently as the French and Italian."</p>
               <p>"Thoſe were agreeable <hi>tete-a-tetes.</hi> Pray did ſhe never expreſs any deſire to ſee her native country?"</p>
               <p>"Oh often—almoſt every hour."</p>
               <p>"Was it not incumbent on your politeneſs, CLEMENT, to offer them a—"</p>
               <p>"I did; but the Marquis was obliged to take a journey to the interior part of Italy."</p>
               <p>"The Marchioneſs accompanied him him, no doubt?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0147101502:199"/>
"No, ſhe was ill at that time with a cold, and did not go with the Marquis."</p>
               <p>"I proteſt I ſhould not have been ſurprized if ſhe had, in ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, played truant, and come over to her native country with you, CLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT?"</p>
               <p>"With me—LUCIA—come over with me—Why that, you know, would have been—a—a—"</p>
               <p>"Like a woman of ſpirit, that is all. I dare ſay now, CLEMENT, if you would but confeſs, this <hi>has</hi> been the caſe."</p>
               <p>"How can you think ſo?—what reaſon in nature have you—to—to—?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0147101502:200"/>
"Why, not much reaſon, indeed; but a billet, which I received this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mentions a Lady that, in ſome degree, allowing for the alteration, as Mr. HENRY HEWSON ſays, anſwers the deſcription of the Marchioneſs."</p>
               <p>"May I—may I beg permiſſion to peruſe your billet, LUCIA?—Is it from—"</p>
               <p>"'Tis from a quite new correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and, by-the-by, there is a ſmall incloſure for you. Here are both."</p>
               <p>I gave him, Miſs LASCELLES, the Marquis's letter.</p>
               <p>"It is very true, Miſs DE GREY," ſaid he, without any emotion, after reading them, "that the Marchioneſs is at preſent under my protection; and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0147101502:201"/>it is true alſo that ſhe came to England, though not with me, very ſoon after me."</p>
               <p>"Is it? then the Marquis is not angry without cauſe?"</p>
               <p>"It is a painful circumſtance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, my dear LUCIA, though there is no guilt on either ſide. You will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me on the ſubject. I beg you will, for a few hours, keep the matter from Mr. DE GREY, and all the reſt of the family. I ſhall certainly wait upon the Marquis, and accommodate every thing. She is ſtill worthy of his affection."</p>
               <p>Did you ever, CAROLINE, ſee <hi>guilt confeſſed,</hi> carried with ſo high a hand? He is ſo habituated, I ſuppoſe, to crimes of this nature, in his Italian connexions, that he thinks nothing of it. 'Tis, in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0147101502:202"/>his notion, I dare ſay, an innocent free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not ſeduction. Was there ever ſo compoſed a libertine? He has juſt made his bow, without any other ſort of diſorder, and walked off.—Let him fight, CAROLINE! let him fall—I hate the ſight of him—I—I—I— oh, my God, my God, what a wretch I am!</p>

                        <p>I CONJURE you to preſerve your life, or at leaſt not to riſque the loſs of it. Do not meet the Marquis. Ah, what have I ſaid? Have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended cowardice to my—to—to Mr. CARLISLE? Yet, what can courage do to the man of conſcious guilt? it can, at beſt, only aggravate guilt by precipitating death to the man who is already wronged. I charge you to—

               <head>LETTER CVIII. Mr LASCELLES to Mr. HEATHCOATE.</head>
               <p>THE obſtinate Marchioneſs hath rejected all nouriſhment till this day, with a pertinacious violence and reſolution peculiarly her own. I was alarmed even for her life, and her death would, at this conjuncture of affairs, be the moſt unſeaſonable thing that could poſſibly happen. This apprehenſion is removed by the receipt of the incloſed billet—You will <hi>there</hi> ſee the terms upon which ſhe requeſted CARLISLE's direction. You will ſee too that it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0147101502:211"/>would have been impolitic in me, under ſuch circumſtances (and eſpecially as ſhe muſt be too feeble to ſtir abroad), to ſtand out with her. Beſides this, I have her <hi>under guard;</hi> the truſty MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RYANNE will not ſuffer a ſecond eſcape. The Marchioneſs ſeems much more compoſed. She does not beat her beautiful boſom; ſhe does not loudly lament her fate as before: the maid is this moment paſſing my room, in her way to the apartment of my poor ſick CAROLINE, with aſſurances of AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUSTA's tranquillity—Thus far, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is a treaty betwixt me and agony. But this is only guarding againſt the enemy in one quarter, while one is more open to his attack in another. The Marquis is certainly hovering about—Perhaps he is gone down with the ſword of Italiant-taught revenge
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0147101502:212"/>even to Prudence Place; upon that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the utmoſt confuſion, if not, the moſt complicated death ſucceeds: upon that ſuppoſition too, I am not ſafe in this houſe a moment. I know not what to do! let me think a little.</p>

Bleſſed be the hand of the poſtman, and may he ever travel through the winter night in ſecurity, for bringing me ſo many cordials. Oh, HEATH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COATE, how infinitely are our pains and pleaſures dependent upon half a ſheet of paper, made legible by ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant a thing as a gooſe's feather!

               <p>BE it ſufficient apology to you for my late ſilence, that I tell you I have been a priſoner till within this hour, without the privilege of getting a letter to the poſt. Such is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of following the fortunes of the man you love. But on this ſubject I can ſpeak no more. My ſtrength is almoſt gone, and yet I am ſetting out for a journey—The horſes are putting to the carriage. It is not to <hi>Rome.</hi> It is not to Paris—No, Signora, it is to the retreat of Captain CARLISLE. Yes, my VIOLA, I have at length obtained
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0147101502:221"/>his addreſs, his <hi>real</hi> addreſs, and I am going at full ſpeed to make uſe of it—Be not ſtartled, my friend—I ſet out with no hoſtile deſign.—My violent wiſhes for revenge are all compoſed now their object is in my power—In <hi>my</hi> power, VIOLA? oh, Heavens, CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE is in the Marquis's power—Even now <hi>perhaps</hi> there may be an horrid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview—My blood runs cold at the thought — Oh that the horſes were ready!—They <hi>are</hi>—they <hi>are!</hi> — The poſtilion opens to me the door—I will take the unfiniſhed letter in my pocket— I will pay double—<hi>double,</hi> VIOLA; I will pay an <hi>hundred fold</hi> for my ſpeed— the life—the precious life of <hi>Carliſle</hi> is in danger—I am gone—</p>
               <p>In Continuation.</p>
               <p>There is five minutes ſtop to change horſes—the other poor faithful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0147101502:222"/>are panting before me—I take up a very bad pen to tell you, that, though I am now travelling in the night, and that a dark one, I travel as a man, and am not without arms. Join with me, VIOLA, to bleſs the name of MARYANNE—To a poor creature ſo called am I indebted for at leaſt the chance of ſaving the lovelieſt of men— the <hi>chance!</hi> oh, my God, is it then reduced to a chance?—to a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability? I would ſooner have every other work of nature annihilated, than that the leaſt miſery ſhould happen to CLEMENT CARLISLE—Ah! Signora, that the Marquis of N. had been ſuch a man!—I am ſummoned—the letter muſt not <hi>yet</hi> be ſent away—Adieu.</p>

               <p>We are changing again—but I am always ſomewhat the later, as there is, it ſeems, a gentleman travelling with equal ſpeed, the ſame road, and he foreſtalls the ſwifteſt horſes. Perhaps, Signora, it is the <hi>Marquis</hi>—Perhaps every turn of his carriage-wheels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates the fate of my CARLISLE— oh horror—horror!—oh that the horſes had wings inſtead of feet! — Thank heaven they look fleeter than my laſt— They are pawing, and champing the bit proudly before me—I ſhed tears of joy at the ſymptom—I move onwards—</p>
               <p>In Continution.</p>
               <p>Ah! Signora—Signora, I am agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by ten thouſand fears—The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0147101502:224"/>who is going ſo furiouſly before me, proves to be LASCELLES—The maid who releaſed me from my priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber told me he was gone a different road—What can be the meaning of this?—I have all along deſcribed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Marquis, but have received no account that anſwers—Perhaps he may be yet tracing his enemy, as he calls him, through the ſtreets of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and I may ſtill be ſo happy as to preſerve him—Oh, VIOLA! what a charming thought!</p>
               <p>The pen and ink is with me in the chaiſe—You muſt diſpenſe with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing ſcarcely legible—</p>
               <p>I keep at proper diſtance from the carriage of LASCELLES—I have bribed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0147101502:225"/>my poſtilion into implicit obedience— Money ſeems to do every thing in this country—</p>
               <p>Oh Heavens, VIOLA! we are in the middle of the laſt ſtage—LASCELLES increaſes his pace—How ſhall I obtain an interview with CARLISLE? Shall I drive directly to the houſe and require an audience? Shall I carry to him ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in my look, and inſiſt upon being heard?</p>
               <p>Ah, no, Signora—Let me not, now that all my unhappy enthuſiaſm for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is over—let me not interrupt the ſcheme of joy that is carrying on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and a worthy woman—Why, poor innocent! ſhould her paſſion be deſtroyed by mine?—<hi>Her's</hi> is regular—
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0147101502:226"/>chaſte, correct, conſiſtent—<hi>She</hi> never <hi>intentionally</hi> claſhed with the unfortunate Marchioneſs of N * * *</p>
               <p>No, VIOLA, I will never diſturb the gentle boſom of another woman, whom I know to be guiltleſs—Let them be happy, Signora—Let them be happy— I ſhall be in my grave.</p>
               <p>I have come to a reſolution, VIOLA! I will diſcharge my carriage before I enter the town, and then wrapping myſelf up in my coat, walk on, till I enquire out ſome inn or open houſe— There will I <hi>write</hi> my fears, and ſend them to Mr. CARLISLE. If his anſwer mentions his ſafety, and his intention to remain ſo, I will then return to—ah, whither, Signora—I have no houſe— no fortune—no huſband—no friend—</p>

                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0147101502:227"/>
And ſhall I depart without even ſeeing him?—Hard—a very hard trial for me, VIOLA! oh, what feelings oppreſs me!— No matter—no matter—My fatal love has already endangered his precious life, and if I can now ſave him, I will be content to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>LASCELLES paid off his chaiſe before me—We ſtopt within a quarter of a mile of the village—I ſaw him deſcend— he walk'd briſkly on—I haſtened to diſcharge my account—ſaw both the carriages return homeward, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to follow Mr. LASCELLES—I will follow <hi>his</hi> ſteps preciſely, unleſs they lead directly to Mr. CARLISLE, and delicacy ſhall prevail, though the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice were to kill me.</p>

               <p>But it is neceſſary for me, however painful, to proceed to the minuteſt of this horrid buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0147101502:231"/>
I traced Mr. CARLISLE, unobſerved, till he came within view of the ſpot. I heard ſomebody advance from behind a tree. It was the Marquis of N ***. It was too late to diſcover myſelf, or to hope any thing from entreaties. They joined, and walked together. I went tremblingly behind. CARLISLE told the whole hiſtory of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate AUGUSTA. He attributed the whole to frolic: he proteſted that ſhe was ſtill under the moſt ſacred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection at the houſe of Mr. LASCELLES in London. He pleaded a thouſand apologies — Pledged himſelf for her fidelity. The Marquis would ſcarce ſuffer him to finiſh a ſingle ſentence without interruption: he is the moſt headſtrong man in the world; he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated CARLISLE as a <hi>ſeducer;</hi> he even reprobated him as a <hi>coward.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſted upon taking his life, if it was not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0147101502:232"/>immediately defended. He ſtrode on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to meaſure the ground.</p>
               <p>"A little farther <hi>on</hi> then, Sir," ſaid he to the Marquis, "this is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place for our, in my opinion, very unneceſſary buſineſs. — Behind yonder houſe is a heath, the claſh of our weapons will not there be heard."</p>
               <p>I was ready to expire, my deareſt Miſs LASCELLES, at every ſtep, and with very great difficulty eſcaped ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>"If it <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo, Sir," continued CARLISLE, "this is the ſpot."</p>
               <p>At this moment, Miſs LASCELLES, we heard a confuſed murmur of voices. The ſounds came from the other ſide of a ſmall plantation of firs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0147101502:233"/>
"Stop, Sir," cried the Marquis— "no witneſſes—all fair play, if you pleaſe; I do not mean to aſſaſſinate <hi>you, Carliſle;</hi> nor ſhall you aſſaſſinate me."</p>
               <p>They both went on the other ſide of the plantation—The moon ſhot forth her ray at the very inſtant of entering; and as if Providence deſigned it ſo, her beams were beyond compariſon bright— Oh earth and heaven, what a ſcene was opened upon us from removing this curtain of darkneſs!</p>
               <p>In one part we beheld the perſons of Mr. MEDWAY and Mr. LASCELLES, as it proved to be, ſtanding upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. In another ſtood the figure of a <hi>ſtripling</hi> leaning penſively againſt a fir, as if he were unengaged in the combat, yet choſe to be a ſpectator. At a ſmall
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0147101502:234"/>diſtance (yet not ſufficiently near to be diſtinguiſhed for the perſons they <hi>really</hi> were) cluſtered another groupe, as if they wiſhed rather to ſee, than to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>"Confuſion," ſaid MEDWAY, "we are diſcovered. If I knew by <hi>whom,</hi> I would annihilate him—Ha!" continued he, looking in the face of his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, "by Heaven, this is not Sir ANDREW FLIGHT."</p>
               <p>"I am his <hi>friend,</hi> Sir," ſaid the other, "and I chooſe to fight for him— Curſe on the moon-beams!"—</p>
               <p>"Good God," cried CARLISLE, by this time come near enough to recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize him: "Is it my friend LASCELLES, whom I behold?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0147101502:235"/>
"<hi>Carliſle!</hi>" exclaimed Mr. LAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLES—"Is it you?"</p>
               <p>"Come, Sir," ſaid the Marquis eagerly, "no trifling — my time is precious."</p>
               <p>CARLISLE drew his ſword.</p>
               <p>"Oh, oh; huſh — huſh" — ſaid MEDWAY, "ſoftly—if that's the caſe— no noiſe: we are all come upon the ſame errand, I find. Advance then, every man his bird, and there's an end of it. As to Sir ANDREW, I will chaſtiſe him for <hi>himſelf,</hi> and in the mean time, as you think fit to repreſent him, I will chaſtiſe you for meddling in the quarrels of a fool—Come on, Sir."</p>
               <p>He fired his piſtol in a moment: Mr. LASCELLES exchanged the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation—They
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0147101502:236"/>were preparing again— The Marquis and CARLISLE began to parry.</p>
               <p>Mr. LASCELLES ſeeing this, eagerly threw down his piſtol:</p>
               <p>"Stop, ſtop, for Heaven's ſake ſtop," ſaid he to the Marquis—"touch not—lift not your arm againſt CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE, I charge you—Here, Sir—here into this boſom direct your vengeance— 'Tis I, Marquis, I have been the cauſe of all your misfortune."</p>
               <p>There was no time for expoſtulation: Mr. LASCELLES caught the ſword from the hand of CARLISLE, and inſiſted upon <hi>firſt</hi> engaging with the Marquis.</p>
               <p>CARLISLE was without arms. MED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WAY haſtened to arm him. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0147101502:237"/>ruſhed upon him, without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing LASCELLES.</p>
               <p>LASCELLES again threw himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore CARLISLE, and even puſhed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly at the Marquis. He was at length provoked to begin with your brother, my dear Miſs LASCELLES The very firſt thruſt of the Marquis was fatal, for the weapon paſſed thro' the ſide of Mr. LASCELLES into his heart. The Marquis received a wound alſo in exchange—</p>
               <p>Your brother had ſcarce fallen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtripling, whom the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects had prevented from more notice (and who had, indeed, retired farther off upon ſeeing us) now came forward in a feeble manner, and fell upon the ground almoſt at the feet of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0147101502:238"/>
"Deſiſt, deſiſt," ſaid the poor thing, in the moſt piercing tone in the world— "deſiſt from farther altercation—Here lies, at the point of all her wiſhes, the unhappy cauſe of—"</p>
               <p>The ſentence was left unfiniſhed, for the ſpeaker of it fainted away.</p>
               <p>Oh, Miſs LASCELLES, it was the Marchioneſs of N *** in diſguiſe— She had raiſed her own beautiful arm againſt her own charming boſom. The point of a ſmall ſword was ſtill ſticking there.</p>
               <p>I ran to her relief.</p>
               <p>The Marquis ſtood fixed in horror, but ſtill looked ſullen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0147101502:239"/>
MEDWAY was gone.</p>
               <p>CARLISLE was agonized by the moſt divided attention.</p>
               <p>The Marchioneſs appeared to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring—She requeſted to be carried to LASCELLES, who was in the ſame ſituation—</p>
               <p>It is too hard a taſk for me, Miſs LASCELLES, to recount to you the dreadful particulars of this pathetic ſcene. It is incumbent upon me, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to obſerve, that ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances appeared on the part of your brother by his own dying confeſſion, that, as it is impoſſible for his life to have been happy, you will the leſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him. <hi>You,</hi> however, my dear Miſs LASCELLES, he cleared from every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that might, in conſequence of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0147101502:240"/>theſe diſcoveries, have been thrown upon you—He confeſſed his error—he bathed the lovely hand of poor AUGUSTA with his laſt tears. He received her forgiveneſs—As for the Marchioneſs herſelf—Oh, Miſs LASCELLES—words can give you no idea of her ſituation.</p>
               <p>She was tremblingly ſenſible to every thing—She looked tenderly at me, and gave my hand to CARLISLE.</p>
               <p>She gave it as ſhe lay bleeding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us—We conveyed her to Prudence Place. Her huſband is not even yet convinced of his cruelties, yet ſhe kiſſed his hand—She wondered not, ſhe ſaid, at CARLISLE's preference.</p>
               <p>"Superior beauty added to ſuperior virtue," ſaid ſhe, taking my hand, "might well conquer."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0147101502:241"/>
Ah, CAROLINE! how I felt this flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery—It went through my very heart— My father wept over her—I never ſaw a houſe of ſo much miſery—Poor CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE'S condition was more touching than the reſt—He execrates himſelf as the innocent cauſe of all—The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis and he are now together—The Marquis ſeems not to regard his wound, which is deeper than we imagined— yet he is not ſo tender as he ſhould be to AUGUSTA. Your brother is laid on CARLISLE'S bed—I ſaw him, a little while ſince, take his lifeleſs hand gently, and turn away weeping.</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow," ſaid he, afterwards, to me, "the beauty of the temptation was great—his love of the dice may well account for <hi>all</hi> the reſt. I loved him much—Let his failings excite no
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0147101502:242"/>other terror than that of making us the wiſer for his example.</p>
               <p>Here, my CAROLINE, is a proſpect darkened—Do not believe I can rejoice under ſuch circumſtances—Your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's corpſe will be—Oh, CAROLINE, theſe are hard ſubjects—I muſt reſign them to a firmer hand than that of the trembling</p>

               <p>THE tears that flowed from the eyes of LUCIA, as ſhe bade the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant carry a letter with your addreſs to the poſt, convince me, how ſincerely ſhe joins me in deploring the unhappy circumſtances of Mr. LASCELLES'S death. Yet, what conſolation can, in theſe caſes, be offered to you? Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your brother's miſtakes in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, his <hi>fraternal</hi> affection might be very unblemiſhed: if ſo, you will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally

Come therefore, dear Madam, amongſt us: or rather, prepare your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ſuch a journey. It is not, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, adviſeable to be here till after the preſent week. Mr. LASCELLES, with his dying breath, bequeathed his remains to CLEMENT CARLISLE.

               <p>WHAT a peculiarity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition marks the Marquis of N***! Though his wound, which he received from your brother, is become more alarming, he inſiſted upon being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go into the apartment of the poor languiſhing AUGUSTA at a very unſeaſonable hour of the laſt night. CARLISLE diſſuaded him from this; but ſoon after he again renewed the ſubject, and was admitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0147101502:249"/>
He ſhut to the door, and ſpoke to his Lady in a very ungentle manner. We were going to expoſtulate with him upon the impropriety of this conduct, when he came out of the room, and told us, the Marchioneſs would be well enough to depart ſoon—He did not ſtay for any reply to this ſtrange intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but ran down ſtairs into the ſaloon, and from thence into the ſtable. He inſiſted upon his horſe, on which, under pretence of taking the air, tho' he was ſcarce able to ſit, he rode away at full ſpeed. He diſturbed us, to enjoy this frolic, in the middle of the night; and he has not been heard of ſince. Surely there never lived ſo ſingular a character.</p>
               <p>Alas! the Marchioneſs is by no means in the recovering way the Marquis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented her. Though her wound was
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0147101502:250"/>more promiſing at the laſt dreſſing, her fever is rather increaſed than abated. Yet ſhe has never ſpoken diſreſpectfully of this ſtrange huſband ſince her illneſs. She ſeemed much relieved, however, at the news of his being gone. "Then," ſays ſhe, "I ſhall die in peace: he will not come again to abuſe me."</p>
               <p>How pathetically, my dear Miſs LAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLES, am I concerned for the life of this lovely woman!—Do not believe I counterfeit: I ſpeak ſincerely. Her conduct has a larger apology in the treatment of ſo barbarous a huſband. —Pray Heaven! ſhe may recover.</p>
               <p>Since I wrote this ſentence, I have been at her bed-ſide, and ſhe cried out—"Oh, Miſs DE GREY, how good you are?—Violent as <hi>I</hi> have been—for which I know you will forgive me—
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0147101502:251"/>had I <hi>known</hi> Mr. CARLISLE'S LUCIA before, I am convinced my veneration for her would have cured me! If I wiſh to recover, Madam, it is only to ſhew you my gratitude: indeed it is!"</p>

               <p>HERE'S pretty news for you! A raſcally Lord refuſes to give me ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and a villainous Baronet has writ me a challenge, and run away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out keeping his appointment. He wanted, moreover, to have bilk'd me by a repreſentative, one LASCELLES, who is killed by another hand, juſt as he was going to attack me for a ſum of money, with a deſign to ſend me to the ſhades, and make off with the price of killing me. There have, alſo, ſeveral other ſtrange things happened in this family of late. There is a wounded Marquis gone juſt now bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0147101502:253"/>away: and his wife is upon her, as I think, death-bed. For this laſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I am much concerned, as ſhe is, even now, a moſt lovely young creature, and I hate, of all things, that young handſome women ſhould die; though the Marquis, her huſband, has no worthy quality belonging to him but his courage. I chooſe to give up my pretenſions to LUCIA. I chooſe to give her to CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE, becauſe ſhe loves him, I find, better than me. I chooſe to alter my will in her favour. All theſe points are ſo many touches of my humour. But as to this Baronet, I muſt hunt him every where on this ſide Heaven, till I have him upon his knees. He made his eſcape ingloriouſly this morning, and indeed lurked about the houſe like a ſcout with a pale face, ever ſince the death of LASCELLES, his bravado. I will either <hi>pink</hi> him, or <hi>humble</hi> him,

Beſides this, Sir, my authors tell me, ſuch battles are criminal, and that he who kills a man by the way of a duel ſports with that eternity which he enters upon, without his commiſſion. But you are a very fierce gentleman, and if the ſage Socrates himſelf was to tell you, you were in the wrong, I do not doubt but you would ſtigmatize the venerable ſeer as a coward.</p>

But, within theſe few minutes, I have found him very much <hi>my</hi> inferior, and below my ſword, by being—a <hi>villain;</hi> who not only hired a tool to fight for him, but had condeſcended to lay plots for the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>ſex</hi> which he

               <p>NOT a word yet from the unaccountable Marquis, although we wiſh very much to ſend him news of his wife's ſurpriſing change for the better. By the care of our excellent phyſician, and by her own previous happy ſtate of health, her wound is healed within a few days to every body's aſtoniſhment. Her candid behaviour to me has engaged not only my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but my tenderneſs. She ſays, ſhe loves Mr. CARLISLE now, juſt as much as ſhe ought to love an amiable

               <p>She never enquires after the Marquis.</p>
               <p>I am ſummoned. Make yourſelf eaſy for Heaven's ſake, my CAROLINE— This requeſt is not more at the heart of your LUCIA, than at that of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Marchioneſs, who ſpeaks of you with a warmth of gratitude peculiar to her.

               <p>THE occaſion of my being ſo ſoon called away from my writing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſk, while I was laſt addreſſing my very dear CAROLINE, was to be preſent at an interview betwixt my father and Mr. and Mrs. HEWSON.</p>
               <p>They deſired a few minutes converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with me and Mr. DE GREY, in the library. They came hand-in-hand. They opened the deſign of their viſit immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0147101502:267"/>
"Maſter DE GREY," ſaid the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, "I am obliged to you for all favours, but I have had enough of your high life: ſo has HETT: we have ſeen men killed, women wounded, friends fighting, honeſt men's wives attempted to be '<hi>bauched,</hi> and Lords taking pet without '<hi>caſion.</hi> So in a few words, HETT and I have '<hi>ſolved</hi> to go back, and live again at Skelter. As to fine breedin, we'l make that out as well as we can. Better be <hi>unp'lite,</hi> Maſter DE GREY, than '<hi>plite</hi> enough to cut friend's throat, and '<hi>bauch</hi> friend's wife: ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Maſter DE GREY, and God be with you."</p>
               <p>My father applauded this reſolution, and without any more ceremony they parted.</p>

                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0147101502:268"/>
They are this minute actually on their way to Helter-Skelter-Hall.</p>
               <p>The Marchioneſs continues to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. But—ſoft—There is a ſervant juſt diſmounting from his horſe, whoſe ſides give ſmoaking teſtimony of the rider's expedition.</p>
               <p>He is coming into the houſe—his look and ſpeed alarm me.</p>
               <p>In Continuation.</p>
               <p>Oh, Heaven, my CAROLINE, the Marquis of N * * * is no more. The meſſenger delivered a letter to the Marchioneſs which mentions his <hi>death.</hi> The letter is from a relation of his in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0147101502:269"/>London, where he died—The wound being neglected, turned to a mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and diſpatched him in a few hours—This obſtinate man, it ſeems, ſhewed his reſentment even upon his death-bed, and bequeathed all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to a diſtant branch of his family— Not a ſingle guinea to his Lady—She read the letter with very little emotion, conſidering what is ſaid to be his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural violence. But ſhe reſolves to go directly to London, feeble as ſhe is, and pay him the laſt duties. She ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards the air too ſoon, but ſhe perſiſts. CARLISLE ſays, ſhe is deprived of every thing by this ſtroke, but a ſcanty jointure. I ventured to touch upon this. She frankly ſaid, in anſwer, that ſhe had ſufficient fortune in the loſs of a cruel, tyrannical huſband!</p>

In Continuation.</p>
               <p>No intreaties can prevail upon the Marchioneſs to ſtay. She declares ſhe is well. Her fever is indeed gone, but the Doctor ſays, ſhe riſques a relapſe. She has paid to my father and me her parting civilities. They were terribly touching, CAROLINE. She ſuppreſſed a ſigh as ſhe gave her hand to CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISLE; but ſhe recovered herſelf, and with incredible reſolution got into her chaiſe, accompanied by Mr. MEDWAY.</p>
               <p>Pray come down to us immediately. With the different tranſitions from one affecting object to another, I am quite fatigued. I tremble for the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—I feel for you—I am unhappy to think it ſhould be my fate to interfere

She may bleſs herſelf ſhe was not <hi>'bauched,</hi> and you, that that ſon of a gun MED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WAY did not <hi>pounce</hi> you—There's doings indeed!

CARLISLE is, to be ſure, a good lad, but as for the reſt o' the pack, 'cept Maſter DE GREY—huſh— huſh, as MEDWAY ſays—Never ſtir, if HETT and I did not lie in clover laſt night.

               <p>I know no more than you, what will be the reſult of it; but I will follow my humour, were it to lead me to the end of the earth and the water.</p>
               <p>I received your two letters, but pray keep your money for other purpoſes— There is no occaſion to make the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more uneaſy by your damned preſents.</p>

               <p>WE are with Signora — AUGUSTA ſigh'd, for the firſt ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles of the journey, every half hour—the reſt of the way, pretty well. —I have been with her to all her old friends—I have trotted after a fair face like a chit of nineteen—But ſhe does not ſigh above once a week—She ſuits my humour to a hair. I ſhall certainly have her in a ſhort time—at leaſt by the hand, and, if you don't interrupt me, perhaps by the heart.—Send word when you are married—That will be my cue. If you ever come to Rome, I will
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0147101502:289"/>move with the Marchioneſs further ſtill, and if you reſolve to purſue me, I will cut your throat. I did intend to give my money to <hi>your</hi> LUCIA, but I ſhall now give it to <hi>my</hi> AUGUSTA. Huſh— I'll follow my humour. Huſh—I am a man of few words; and the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs loves me the better for it. Unleſs you die, which I don't wiſh, I will never return to England. No—no— Colonel, let us be good friends at a diſtance. No noiſe.</p>

               <p>THEN all may again be well. Your letters charm me. AUGUSTA will every day become more ſenſible of MEDWAY's merit, and her good heart will be wholly his.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0147101502:291"/>are got home—Miſs LASCELLES is ſo far compoſed to conſent to live with her LUCIA: and Mr. DE GREY is better than he has been for ſome time.</p>
               <p>What then remains?</p>

               <p>You will not expect me to proceed?</p>
