            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IN a book publiſhed in the year 1756, I related the principal tranſactions of my life, from my entrance into the univerſity to the day of my marriage, in the year 1725; and endeavoured, by the way, to entertain my Readers with a variety of notions and remarks.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to tell the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my ſtory, and to lay before the Public ſome more of my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and hints: This ſecond vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume is chiefly a further vindication of myſelf; and the obſervations I add on ſubjects and matters of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds, are ſuch reflections as reſulted from the reaſon and nature of things, and were formed by a judgment free, and unbiaſſed by
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0028500202:3"/>any authority. My own apology is the principal thing, interſperſed with real characters of ſeveral ſorts; and the additions to it, are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſolid, natural, and delicate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious things as came in my way. This is my book. I write with modeſty, and I purpoſe to do good. I imagine then, that all <hi>Critics</hi> (except the <hi>Critical Review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>) will wink at the blemiſhes of a laudable writing. Scholars and men of ſenſe (who are above male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and the ſupercilious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,) can bear deformities in a long work, and juſtly lay them on the imperfection of human nature. They know it is incapable of faultleſs productions.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0028500202:19"/>have been a wilderneſs to me; that the woods, the groves, the walks, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the flowers, the fruits, the day, the night, all would have wanted a reliſh, without that dear, delightful companion, a wife; it amazes me to hear many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible people ſpeak with abhorrence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and inſiſt upon it, that wedlock produces ſo many troubles, even where the pair have affection, and ſorrows ſo very great, when they have no love for each other, or begin to fail in the kind and obliging offices, that it is contrary to reaſon to contract, if we have a juſt regard to peace and ſatisfaction of mind, and would avoid, as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the woes and bewailings of this turbid period. If you have acquired the divine habits, marriage may unhinge them. It often forces even the pious into immoralities. True, unhappy are many a wedded pair: years of calamity this engagement has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to thouſands of mortals: it has made the moſt pious divines become very cruel, as I could relate: it has cauſed the moſt generous, ſenſible men, to murder the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they adored before they were their wives.</p>

                           <head>The Hiſtory of Orlando and Bellinda.</head>
                           <p>§. 2. This ſtory has been told before by the <hi>Tatler,</hi> in his 172d paper; but as he has
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0028500202:20"/>related only by hear ſay, and was miſtaken in ſeveral particulars, the account I give of this extraordinary affair, may be grateful to the reader.</p>
                           <p>When I was a little boy in <hi>Dublin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſeven and eight, Mr. <hi>Euſtace</hi> and his Lady lived next door to my father, in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and the two families were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Being a lively prating thing, Mrs. <hi>Euſtace</hi> was fond of me, and by tarts and fruit, encouraged me to run into her parlour as often as I could. This made me well acquainted in the houſe; and, as I was a remarker ſo early in my life, I had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of making the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Orlando Euſtace</hi> was a tall, thin, ſtrong man, well made, and a very genteel perſon. His face was pale, and marked with the ſmall-pox: his features were good, and yet there was ſomething fierce in his look, even when he was not diſpleaſed. He had ſenſe and learning, and, with a large fortune, was a generous man; but paſſionate to an amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing degree, for his underſtanding; and a trifle would throw him into a rage. He had been humoured in every thing from his cradle, on account of his fine eſtate; from his infancy to his manhood, had been continually flattered, and in every thing obeyed. This made him opinionated and proud, obſtinate,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0028500202:21"/>and incapable of bearing the leaſt contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellinda Coot,</hi> his Lady, with whom he had been paſſionately in love, was as fine a figure as could be ſeen among the daughters of men. Her perſon was charming; her face was beautiful, and had a ſweetneſs in it that was pleaſing to look at. Her vivacity was great, and her underſtanding extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; but ſhe had a ſatirical wit, and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which made her delight in ſhewing the weakneſs of other minds, and the clearneſs of her own conception. She was too good, however, to have the leaſt malice in ſuch procedure. It was human weakneſs, and a deſire to make her neighbours wiſer. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for her, ſhe was married to a man, who, of all men in the world, was the unfitteſt ſubject for her quick fancy to act on.</p>
                           <p>But, notwithſtanding this, <hi>Euſtace</hi> and <hi>Bellinda</hi> were, for the moſt of their time, very fond. As ſhe was formed in a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of nature, to ſhew mankind a finiſhed compoſition, and had wit and charms enough to fire the dulleſt and moſt inſenſible heart; a man of <hi>Orlando</hi>'s taſte for the ſex, could not be without an inflamed heart, when ſo near the tranſporting object of deſire. She was his delight for almoſt a year, the dear ſupport of his life. He ſeemed to value her
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0028500202:22"/>eſteem, her reſpect, her love; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to merit them by the virtues which fortify love: and therefore, when by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort, poſitive, and unreaſonable in his dictates, as was too often his wont; and on her being intemperate in the ſtrong ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments her imagination produced upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, which was too frequently the caſe; when they ſeemed to forget the Apoſtle's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for a while, <hi>that ye love one another with a pure heart, fervently;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 22. and had ſtrifes and debates, which ſhewed, for the time they laſted, that they were far from being perfect and entire, wanting nothing; then would her throwing her face into ſmiles, with ſome tender expreſſion, prove a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling method at once. Till the fatal night, this always had a power to ſoften pain, to eaſe and calm the raging man.</p>
                           <p>But poor at beſt is the condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life here below; and, when to weak and imperfect faculties, we add inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and do not act up to the eternal law of <hi>reaſon,</hi> and of God; when love of fame, curioſity, reſentment, or any of our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar propenſities; when humour, vanity, or any of our inferior powers, are permitted to act againſt juſtice and veracity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reflecting on the <hi>reaſon of the thing,</hi> or the <hi>right of the caſe,</hi> that by the influence this has on the mind, we may be conſtituted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0028500202:23"/>virtuous, and attached to truth; we go down with the current of the paſſions, and let bent and humour determine us, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to what is decent and fit: if in a ſtate ſo unfriendly as this is, to the heavenly and divine life, where folly and vice are for ever ſtriving to introduce diſorder into our frame, and it is difficult indeed, to preſerve, in any degree, an integrity of character, and peace within: — if, in ſuch a ſituation, inſtead of labouring to deſtroy all the ſeeds of envy, pride, ill-will, and impatience, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to eſtabliſh and maintain a due inward oeconomy and harmony, by paying a perpetual regard to truth, that is, to the real circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and relation of things in which we ſtand, — to the practice of reaſon in its juſt extent, according to the capacities and natures of every being; we do, on the contrary, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard the <hi>moral faculty,</hi> and become a mere ſyſtem of paſſions and affections, without any thing at the head of them to govern them; — what then can be expected, but deficiency and deformity, degeneracy and guilty prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? This was the caſe of <hi>Euſtace</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda. Paſſion</hi> and <hi>own-will</hi> were ſo near and intimate to him, that he ſeemed to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a deliberate reſolution not to be governed by reaſon. He would wink at the light he had, ſtruggle to evade conviction, and make his mind a <hi>chaos</hi> and a <hi>hell. Bellinda,</hi> at the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0028500202:24"/>ſame time, was too <hi>quick,</hi> too <hi>vain,</hi> and too often forgot to take into her idea of a good character, a <hi>continual ſubordination</hi> of the <hi>lower powers</hi> of our nature to the <hi>faculty of reaſon.</hi> This produced the following ſcene.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Maria</hi> (ſiſter to <hi>Bellinda</hi>) returned one evening with a five-guinea fan ſhe had bought that afternoon, and was tedious in praiſing ſome <hi>Indian</hi> figures that were painted in it. Mrs. <hi>Euſtace,</hi> who had a taſte for pictures, ſaid, the colours were fine, but the images ridiculous and deſpicable; and her ſiſter muſt certainly be a little <hi>Indian-mad,</hi> or her fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for every thing from that ſide of the globe could not be ſo exceſſive and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant as it always appeared to be.</p>
                           <p>To this <hi>Maria</hi> replied with ſome heat, and <hi>Euſtace</hi> very peremptorily inſiſted upon it, that ſhe was right. With poſitiveneſs and paſſion, he magnified the beauties of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in the fan, and with violence reflected ſo ſeverely on the good judgment <hi>Bellinda,</hi> upon all occaſions, pretended to, (as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it) that at laſt, her imagination was fired, and, with too much eagerneſs, ſhe not only ridiculed the opinion of her ſiſter, in reſpect of ſuch things, but ſpoke with too much warmth againſt the deſpotic tempers of ſelf-ſufficient huſbands.</p>
                           <p>To reverence and obey (ſhe ſaid) was not required by any obligation, when men were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0028500202:25"/>unreaſonable, and paid no regard to a wife's domeſtic and perſonal felicity; nor would ſhe give up her underſtanding to his weak deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, ſince cuſtom cannot confer an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which nature has denied: It cannot licenſe a huſband to be unjuſt, nor give right to treat her as a ſlave. If this was to be the caſe in matrimony, and women were to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under conjugal vexations, as ſhe did, by his ſenſeleſs arguments every day, they had better bear the reproach and ſolitude of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated virginity, and be treated as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of the world, in the character of old maids.</p>
                           <p>This too lively, though juſt ſpeech, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged <hi>Euſtace</hi> to the laſt degree, and from a fury, he ſunk in a few minutes into a total ſullen ſilence, and ſat for half an hour, while I ſtayed, cruelly determining, I ſuppoſe, her ſad doom. <hi>Bellinda</hi> ſoon ſaw ſhe had gone too far, and did all that could be done to recover him from the fit he was in. She ſmiled, cried, aſked pardon; but 'twas all in vain. Every charm had loſt its power, and he ſeemed no longer man. When this beauty ſtood weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his chair, and ſaid, My love, forgive me, as it was in rallery only I ſpoke, and let our pleaſures and pains be hereafter ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſhared; I remember the tears burſt from my eyes, and in that condition I went away. It was frightful to look at <hi>Euſtace,</hi>
                              <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0028500202:26"/>as he ſhook, ſtarted, and wildly ſtared; and the diſtreſs his Lady appeared in, was enough to make the moſt ſtony heart bleed: it was a diſmal ſcene.</p>
                           <p>This happened at nine at night, and at ten <hi>Orlando</hi> withdrew to bed, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one word, as I was informed. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he lay down, he pretended to be faſt aſleep, and his wife rejoicing to find him ſo, as ſhe believed, in hopes that nature's ſoft nurſe would lull the active inſtruments of motion, and calm the raging operations of his mind: ſhe reſigned herſelf to ſlumbers, and thought to aboliſh for that night every diſagreeable ſenſation of pain: but no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did this furious man find that his charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife was really aſleep, than he plunged a dagger into her breaſt. The monſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the ſtrokes, while ſhe had life to ſpeak to him, in the tendereſt manner, and conjured him, in regard to his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to let her live, and not ſink himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perdition here and hereafter, by her death. In vain ſhe prayed; he gave her a thouſand wounds, and I ſaw her the next morning a bloody, mangled corpſe, in the great houſe in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> which ſtood at a diſtance from the ſtreet, with a wall before it, and an avenue of high trees up to the door; and not in the country, as the <hi>Tatler</hi> ſays.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0028500202:27"/>
                              <hi>Euſtace</hi> fled, when he thought ſhe was expiring, (though ſhe lived for an hour after, to relate the caſe to her maid, who heard her groan, and came into her room) and went from <hi>Dublin</hi> to a little lodge he had in the country, about twenty miles from town. The magiſtrates, in a ſhort time, had infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation where he was; and one <hi>John Manſel,</hi> a conſtable, a bold and ſtrong man, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, for a reward, to apprehend him. To this purpoſe, he ſet out immediately, with a caſe of piſtols, and a hanger, and lurked ſeveral days and nights in the fields, before he could find an opportunity of coming at him; for <hi>Euſtace</hi> lived by himſelf in the houſe, well ſecured by ſtrong doors and bars, and only went out now and then, to an ale-houſe, the maſter of which was his friend. Near it, at laſt, about break of day, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> chanced to find him, and, upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be made a priſoner, and cocking a piſtol to ſhoot the officer of juſtice, both their piſtols were diſcharged at once, and they both dropt down dead men. <hi>Euſtace</hi> was ſhot in the heart, and the conſtable in the brain. They were both brought to <hi>Dublin</hi> on one of the little low-back'd cars there uſed; and I was one of the boys that followed the car, from the beginning of <hi>James-ſtreet,</hi> the out-ſide of the city, all thro' the town. <hi>Euſtace</hi>'s head hung dangling
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0028500202:28"/>near the ground, with his face upwards, and his torn bloody breaſt bare; and of all the faces of the dead I have ſeen, none ever look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like his. There was an anxiety, a rage, a horror, and a deſpair to be ſeen in it, that no pencil could expreſs.</p>

Thus fell <hi>Euſtace</hi> in the 29th year of his age, and by his hand his virtuous, beautiful, and ingenious wife: and what are we to learn from thence? is it, that on ſuch accounts, we ought to dread wedlock, and never be concerned with a wife; No, ſurely; but to be from thence convinced, that it is neceſſary, in order to a happy marriage, to bring the will to the obedience of reaſon, and acquire an equanimity in the general tenour of life. Of all things in this world, <hi>moral dominion,</hi> or the <hi>empire over ourſelves,</hi> is not only the moſt glorious, as reaſon is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior nature of man, but the moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in reſpect of real human happineſs. A conformity to reaſon, or good ſenſe, and to the inclination of our neighbours, with very little money, may produce great and laſting felicity; but without this ſubſervience to our own reaſon, complaiſance to company, and ſoftneſs and benevolence to all around us, the greateſt miſery does frequently ſprout from the largeſt ſtock of fortunes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0028500202:29"/>
It was by ungoverned paſſions, that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtace</hi> murdered his wife and died himſelf, the moſt miſerable and wretched of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings. He might have been the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of mortals, if he had conformed to the dictates of reaſon, and ſoftened his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as well for his own eaſe, as in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to a creature formed with a mind of a quite different make from his own. There is a ſort of ſex in ſouls; and, excluſive of that love and patience which our religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, every couple ſhould remember, that there are things which grow out of their very natures, that are pardonable, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſuch. Let them not, therefore, be ſpying out faults, nor find a ſatisfaction in reproaching; but let them examine to what conſequences their ideas tend, and reſolve to ceaſe from cheriſhing them, when they lead to contention and miſchief. Let them both endeavour to amend what is wrong in each other, and act as becomes their character, in practiſing the ſocial duties of married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which are ſo frequently and ſtrongly inculcated by revelation and natural reaſon; and then, inſtead of matrimony's being a burthen, and hanging a weight upon our very beings, there will be no appearance of evil in it, but harmony and joy will ſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed felicities on them: they will live in no low degree of beatitude in the ſuburbs of heaven.</p>

This was my caſe: wedlock to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the greateſt bleſſing; a ſcene of the moſt refined friendſhip, and a condition to which nothing can be added to complete the ſum of human felicity. So I found the holy and ſublime relation, and in the wilds of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> enjoyed a happineſs as great as human nature is capable of, on this planet. Senſible to all the ties of ſocial truth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, my partner and I lived in perfect feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, on the products of our ſolitary farm. The amiable diſpoſitions of her mind, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, good nature, diſcretion, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, gave a perpetual dignity and luſtre to the grace and lovelineſs of her perſon; and as I did all that love and fidelity could do, by practiſing every rule of caution, prudence, and juſtice, to prevent variance, ſoften cares, and preſerve affection undiminiſhed, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our ſtate was unmixed and divine. Since the primitive inſtitution of the relation, it never exiſted in a more delightful manner. Devoted to each other's heart, we deſired no other happineſs in this world, than to paſs life away together in the ſolitude we were in. We lived, hoped, and feared but for each other; and made it our daily ſtudy to be what revealed religion preſcribes, and the concurrent voice of nature requires, in the ſacred tie. Do ſo likewiſe, ye mortals, who intend to marry, and ye may, like us, be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0028500202:31"/>happy. As the inſtincts and paſſions were wiſely and kindly given us, to ſubſerve many purpoſes of our preſent ſtate, let them have their proper, ſubaltern ſhare of action; but let reaſon ever have the ſovereignty, (the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law of reaſon and truth) and be, as it were, ſail and wind to the veſſel of life.</p>

Two years, almoſt, this fine ſcene laſted, and during that period, the buſineſs and diverſions of our lone retreat appeared ſo various and pleaſing, that it was not poſſible to think a hundred years ſo ſpent, in the leaſt degree dull and tedious. Excluſive of books and gardening, and the improvement of the farm, we had, during the ſine ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a thouſand charming amuſements on the mountains, and in the glens and vallies of that ſweet ſilent place. Whole days we would ſpend in fiſhing, and dine in ſome cool grot by the water-ſide, or under an aged tree, on the margin of ſome beautiful ſtream. We generally uſed the fly and rod; but, if in haſte, had recourſe to one of the little water-falls, and, by fixing a net under one of them, would take a dozen or two of very large trouts, in a few minutes time.</p>
               <p>By a little water-fall, I mean one of thoſe that are formed by ſome ſmall river, which tumbles there in various places, from rock to rock, about four feet each fall, and makes a

               <p>Another of our amuſements, during the ſummer's bright day, was the pointer and gun, for the <hi>black cock,</hi> the <hi>moor cock,</hi> and the <hi>cock of the wood,</hi> which are in great plenty on thoſe vaſt hills. <hi>Charlotte</hi> was fond of this ſport, and would walk with me for hours, to ſee me knock down the game; till, late in the evening, we would wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over the fells, and then return to our clean, peaceful, little houſe, to ſup as ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly on our birds<note n="(1)" place="bottom">

The head and eyes are large, and round the eyes is a beautiful circle of red. The beak is ſtrong, and black as the body; the legs robuſt and red. It is very high eating; more ſo than any native in <hi>England</hi> except the fen-ortolan; but in one particular it exceeds the fen birds, for it has two taſtes; it being brown and white meat: under a lay of brown is a lay of white meat; both delicious: the brown is higher than the black moor cock, and the white much richer than the pheaſant.</p>

The back is a mixture of black, grey, and a reddiſh brown; the belly grey, and the breaſt a pale brown, with tranſverſe lines of black, and a little white at the tips of the feathers. It has a large round head, of the pureſt black, and over its fine hazle eyes, there is a naked ſpace, that looks like an eye-brow of bright ſcarlet. It is delicious eating, but far inferior to the black cock.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0028500202:34"/>do, and with a harmony and unmixed joy they are for ever ſtrangers to. After ſupper, over ſome little nectared-bowl, we ſweetly chatted, till it was bed-time; or I played on my flute, and <hi>Charlotte</hi> divinely ſung. It was a happy life; all the riches and honours of the world cannot produce ſuch ſcenes of bliſs as we experienced in a cottage, in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0028500202:35"/>Wilds of <hi>Weſtmoreland.</hi> Even the winter, which is ever boiſterous and extreme cold in that part of the world, was no ſeverity to us. As we had moſt excellent proviſions of every kind in abundance, and plenty of firing from the ancient woods, which cover many of thoſe high hills; and two men ſervants, and two maids, to do whatever tended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and to well-being, to ſupply our wants, and to complete our happineſs. — This ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hard rough ſcene, and the roaring waters, and the howling winds, appeared pleaſing ſounds. In ſhort, every ſeaſon, and all our hours, were quite charming, and full of delight. Good <hi>Tom Fleming,</hi> our friend, did likewiſe enhance our felicity, by coming once or twice a week to ſee us, and ſtaying ſometimes two or three days. In the ſummer time, we alſo went now and then to viſit him; and, if one was inclined to melancholy, yet it was impoſſible to be dull while he was by. His humour, and his ſongs, over a bowl of punch, were enough to charm the moſt ſplenetic, and make even rancour throw its face into ſmiles.</p>

A fever, in a few days, ſnapt off the thread of her life, and made me the child of affliction, when I had not a thought of the mourner. Language cannot paint the diſtreſs this calamity reduced me to; nor give an idea of what I ſuffered, when I ſaw her eyes ſwimming in death, and the throws of her departing ſpirit.

                  <note place="margin">A reflexion on death.</note>§. 6. <hi>O eloquent, juſt, and mighty death!</hi> (ſays <hi>Raleigh</hi>) It is thou alone puts wiſdom into the human heart, and ſuddenly makes man to know himſelf. It is <hi>death</hi> that makes the <hi>conquenor</hi> aſhamed of his fame, and wiſh he had rather ſtolen out of the world, than purchaſed the report of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0028500202:37"/>by rapine, oppreſſion, and cruelty; by giving in ſpoil the innocent and labouring ſoul to the idle and inſolent; by emptying the cities of the world of their ancient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and filling them again with ſo many; and ſo variable ſorts of ſorrows. It is <hi>death</hi> tells the <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>inſolent,</hi> that they are but <hi>objects,</hi> and humbles them at the inſtant; makes them cry, complain, and repent; yea, even to hate their former happineſs. It is <hi>death</hi> takes the account of the <hi>rich,</hi> and proves him a <hi>beggar,</hi> a naked beggar, which hath intereſt in nothing but the gravel which fills his mouth. It is <hi>death</hi> holds a glaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the moſt <hi>beautiful,</hi> and makes them ſee therein their <hi>deformity</hi> and <hi>rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and they acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>Whom none could adviſe, thou haſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded: what none have dared, thou haſt done: and whom all the world hath flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou only haſt caſt out of the world, and deſpiſed. Thou haſt drawn together all the far-ſtretched greatneſs, all the pride, cruelty, and ambition, of man; all the powerful charms of beauty; and covered it all over with theſe two narrow words, <hi>Hic jacet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is this all, <hi>mighty death!</hi> It is thou that leadeſt to the reſurrection of the dead; the diſſolution of the world; the judgment day; and the eternal ſtate of men. It is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0028500202:38"/>thou that finiſhes the trial of men, and ſeals their characters, for happineſs or miſery for ever.</p>
               <p>Be thou then, <hi>death,</hi> our morning and evening meditation: let us learn from thee the vanity of all human things; and that it is the moſt amazing folly, to melt away time, and miſ-apply talents, as the generality of reaſonable beings do: that we were not made men, thinking, rational beings, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the nobleſt contemplations, to ſpend all our thoughts and time in ſenſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in dreſſing, feeding, and ſporting; or, in purchaſes, building and planting; but to prepare for a <hi>dying hour;</hi> that, when at the call of God, we go out of the body, <hi>not knowing whither we go,</hi> we may, like <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> travel by <hi>faith,</hi> and truſt to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Lord of all countries. Since we muſt die, and thy power, O <hi>death,</hi> we ſee, is uncontrolable: ſince to the duſt we muſt return, and take our trial at the bar of Almighty God, as <hi>intelligent and free agents;</hi> (for <hi>under moral government,</hi> and God is a perfectly wiſe and righteous governor, the <hi>wickedneſs of the wicked will be upon him,</hi> and the <hi>righteouſneſs of the righteous will be upon him;</hi>) — ſince we muſt be numbered with the <hi>dead,</hi> and our <hi>circumſtances</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> indicate a <hi>future judgment,</hi> ſurely we ought to remove our chief concern from this world
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0028500202:39"/>to the other, and transfer our principal regard to the immortal ſpirit; that in the <hi>hour of agony,</hi> a <hi>virtuous mind, purity of conſcience,</hi> and <hi>good actions,</hi> may procure us the favour of God, and the guidance of his good ſpirit to the manſions of the bleſſed, where new pleaſures are for ever ſpringing up, and the happineſs of the heavenly inhabitants is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually increaſing. This is the one thing needful. <hi>Death</hi> demonſtrates, that this world of darkneſs and error, changes and chances, is not worth fixing our heart on. To ſecure our paſſage into the regions of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and eternal day, ſhould be the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of immortal mortals.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Thus did I reflect as I ſat among the <hi>dead,</hi> with my eyes faſtened on the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs corps of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and I wiſhed, if it was poſſible, to have leave to depart, and in the hoſpitable grave, lie down from toil and pain, to take my laſt repoſe; for I knew not what to do, nor where to go. I was not qualified for the world; nor had I a friend, or even an acquaintance in it, that I knew where to find. But in vain I prayed; it was otherwiſe decreed: I muſt go on, or continue a ſolitary in the wild I was in. The latter it was not poſſible for me to do, in the ſtate of mind I was in; overwhelmed with ſorrow, and without a companion of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0028500202:40"/>any kind; and therefore, I muſt of neceſſity go to ſome other place. I ſold all the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things I had to Fryar <hi>Fleming,</hi> and lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up my doors. My furniture, linen, clothes, books, liquors, and ſome ſalt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, inſtruments of various kinds, and ſuch like things, I left in their ſeveral places. There was no one to take them, or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that any one would come there to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb them; and perhaps, ſome time or other, the fates might bring me back again to the lone place. Though it was then a deſolate, ſilent habitation, a ſtriking memento of the vanity and precarious exiſtence of all human good things; yet it was poſſible, that hearty friendſhip, feſtivity, and ſocial life, might once more be ſeen there. The force and operation of caſualties did wonders every day, and time might give me even a reliſh for the ſolitude in a few years more. Thus did I ſettle affairs in that remote place; and, taking leave of my friend, the fryar, with my lad <hi>O Finn,</hi> rode off.</p>

THE ſun was riſing, when we mounted our horſes, and I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain went out to try my fortune in the world; not like the Chevalier of <hi>La Mancha,</hi> in hopes of conquering a kingdom, or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſome great Princeſs; but to ſee if I could find another good country girl for a wife, and get a little more money; as they were the only two things united, that could ſecure me from melancholy, and confer real happineſs. To this purpoſe, as the day was extremely fine, and <hi>Finn</hi> had ſomething cold, and a couple of bottles at the end of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life, I gave my horſe the rein, and let him take what way his fancy choſe. For ſome time, he gently trotted the path he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten gone, and over many a mountain made
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0028500202:42"/>his road: but at laſt, he brought me to a place I was quite a ſtranger to, and made a full ſtop at a deep and rapid water, which ran by the bottom of a very high hill I had not been up before. Over this river I made him go, though it was far from being ſafe, and in an hour's ride from that flood, came to a fine rural ſcene.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpot of earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fells of <hi>Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note>§. 2. It was paſture-ground, of a large extent, and in many places covered with groves of trees, of various kinds; walnuts, cheſnuts, and oaks; the poplar, the plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, the mulberry, and maple. There was likewiſe the <hi>Phoenician</hi> cedar, the larix, the large-leafed laurel, and the cytiſſus of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil.</hi> In the middle of this place were the ruins of an old ſeat, over-run with ſhrubby plants; the <hi>Virginia</hi> creeper, the box-thorn, the jeſſamine, the honey-ſuckle, the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winkle, the birdweed, the ivy, and the climber; and near the door was a flowing ſpring of water, which formed a beautiful ſtream, and babbled to the river we came from. Charming ſcene! ſo ſilent, ſweet, and pretty, that I was highly pleaſed with the diſcovery.</p>

                  </note>§. 3. On the margin of the brook, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mulberry tree, I dined, on ſomething which <hi>Finn</hi> produced from his wallet, tongue
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0028500202:43"/>and ham, and potted <hi>black cock;</hi> and having drank a pint of cyder, ſet out again, to try what land lay right onwards. In an hour, we came to a large and dangerous watery moor, which we croſſed over with great difficulty, and then arrived at a range of mountains, through which there was a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſs, wet and ſtony, a long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ride, which ended on the border of a fine country: at four in the afternoon, we arrived on the confines of a plain, about a hundred acres, which was ſtrewed with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious flowers of the earth's natural produce, that rendered the glebe delightful to behold, and was ſurrounded with groves. The place had all the charms that verdure, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and vale, can give a country. In the centre of this ground was a handſome ſquare building, and behind it a large and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful garden, which had a low, thick, holly-hedge, that encompaſſed it. As the door of this houſe was not locked, but opened by a ſilver ſpring turner, I went in, and found it was one fine ſpacious room, filled on every ſide with books, bound in an extraordinary manner. Globes, teleſcopes, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of various kinds, were placed on ſtands, and there were two fine writing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, one at each end of the library, which had paper, ink, and pens. In the middle of the room there was a reading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſk,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0028500202:44"/>which had a ſhort inſcription, and on it leaned the ſkeleton of a man. The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend ſaid,—<hi>This ſkeleton was once Charles Henley, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amazed I ſtood, looking on theſe things, and wondered much at the figure of the bones, tack'd together with wires; once, to be ſure, the maſter of this grand collection of books and manuſcripts, and this fine room, ſo ſweetly ſituated in the centre of diſtant groves: this ſkeleton had a ſtriking effect on my mind; and the more ſo, as it held a ſcroll of parchment, on which was beautifully written in the <hi>court-hand,</hi> (to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more remarkable, I ſuppoſe) the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lines:</p>
               <p>"Fellow-mortal, whoever thou art, whom the fates ſhall conduct into this chamber, remember, that before many years are paſſed, thou muſt be laid in the bed of corruption, in the dark caverns of death, among the lifeleſs duſt, and rotten bones of others, and from the grave proceed to the general reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of all. To new life and vigour thou wilt moſt certainly be raiſed, to be brought to a great account. Naked and defenceleſs thou muſt ſtand before the awful tribunal of the great God, and from him receive a final ſentence, which ſhall determine and fix thee in an eternal ſtate of happineſs or miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0028500202:45"/>
What an alarm ſhould this be! Ponder, my fellow-mortal; and remember, God now commandeth men every where to repent, becauſe he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs, by that man, whom he hath ordained; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.— <hi>Judge the world!</hi> — <hi>judgment!</hi> — the very found is ſolemn. Should it not deaden ſome part, at leaſt, of your concern for things temporal, and quicken your care and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for the future life; — ought it not to make us condemn, before the dying hour, our vanity, and devotedneſs to bodily things, and make us employ the greateſt part of our time in the acquiſition of wiſdom, and an improvement in virtue, that when we appear at the ſeſſions of righteouſneſs, a ſacred knowledge, a heavenly piety, and an ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic goodneſs, may ſecure us from eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and entitle us to a glorious eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Since a future judgment is moſt certainly the caſe, and the conſequence eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or ſalvation, how contemptible a thing is a long buſy life, ſpent in raking through the mire of trade and buſineſs, in purſuit of riches and a large eſtate; or in ſweating up the ſteep hill of ambition, after fame and ambition; or in living and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as if we were <hi>all body,</hi> and ſent into
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0028500202:46"/>time for no other purpoſe, than to adorn like idols, gratify like brutes, and waſte life in ſenſuality and vanity:—how contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and unreaſonable is this kind of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for beings, who were created to no other end, than to be partakers of a divine life with God, and ſing hallelujahs to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; to ſeparate the creature from error, fiction, impurity, and corruption, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that purity and holineſs, which alone can ſee God. Away then with a <hi>worldly heart:</hi> away with all thoſe follies, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us like fools and madmen; and let the principal thing be, to follow the ſteps of our great maſter, by patience and reſignation, by a charity and contempt of the world; and by keeping a conſcience void of offence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the changes and chances of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life; that at <hi>his ſecond coming,</hi> to judge the world, we may be found <hi>acceptable</hi> in his ſight.</p>
               <p>What a ſcene muſt this ſecond coming be! I ſaw, (ſays an apoſtle) a great white throne, and him that ſat on it; from whoſe face the earth and the heavens fled away, and there was no place found for them; and I ſaw the dead ſmall and great ſtand before God; and the books were opened, and the dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in the books: and the ſea gave up her dead, and death and hell delivered
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0028500202:47"/>up their dead which were in them, and they were judged every man, according to their works. The <hi>ſecret wickedneſs</hi> of men will be brought to light; and <hi>concealed piety</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted virtue</hi> be acknowledged and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. While innocence and piety are ſet at the right hand of the judge, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall ſhine forth as the ſun in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their father for ever and ever, ſhame and confuſion muſt ſit upon the faces of the ſinner and the ungodly. <hi>Damnation</hi> will ſtand before the brethren in iniquity, and when the intolerable ſentence is executed, what inexpreſſible agonies will they fall into? what amazement and exceſſes of horror muſt ſeize upon them?</p>
               <p>Ponder then, in time, fellow-mortal, and chuſe to be good, rather than to be great: prefer your baptiſmal vows to the pomps and vanities of this world; and value the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret whiſpers of a good conſcience more than the noiſe of popular applauſe.</p>
               <p>Since you muſt appear before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat of Chriſt; that every one may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad, let it be your work from morning till night, to keep Jeſus in your hearts; and long for nothing, deſire nothing, hope for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to have all that is within you changed into the ſpirit and temper of the <hi>holy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0028500202:48"/>Jeſus.</hi> Wherever you go, whatever you do, do all in imitation of his temper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; and look upon all as nothing, but that which exerciſes and increaſes the ſpirit and life of Chriſt in your ſouls.—Let this be your Chriſtianity, your church, and your religion, and the judgment-day will be a charming ſcene. If in this world, the will of the creature, as an offspring of the divine will, <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>works</hi> with the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and labours, without ceaſing, to come as near as mortals can, to the purity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the divine nature; then will the <hi>day of the Lord</hi> be a day of great joy, and with unutterable pleaſure, you ſhall hear that tremendous voice: <hi>Awake, ye dead, and come to judgment.</hi> In tranſports, and full of honour and glory, the wiſe and righteous, will hear the happy ſentence, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi>"</p>
               <p>This, and the ſkeleton, aſtoniſhed me not a little; and my wonder at the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, as I could find no human creature living, nor diſcover any houſe or cottage for an inhabitant. This I though exceeded all the ſtrange things I had ſeen in this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful country. But perhaps, (it occured at laſt,) there might be a manſion in the woods before me, or ſomewhere in the groves on either ſide; and therefore, leaving the library,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0028500202:49"/>after I had ſpent an hour in it, I walked on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and came to a wood, which had private walks cut through it, and ſtrewed with ſand. They ſhewed only light enough to diſtinguiſh the blaze of day from evening ſhade, and had feats diſperſed, to ſit and liſten to the chorus of the birds, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the pleaſures of the ſoft ſilent place. For about three hundred yards the walk I was in extended, and then terminated in meadows, which formed an oval of twenty acres, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by groves, like the large plain I came from. Exactly in the middle of theſe fields, part of which were turned into gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, there ſtood a very handſome ſtone houſe, and not far from the door of it, a fountain played. On either ſide of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was a garden-chair, of a very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary make, curious and beautiful; and each of them ſtood under an ever-green oak, the broad leaved Ilex, a charming ſhade.</p>

When I came near two ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, I bowed low to the ground, and aſked pardon for intruding into their fine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. But the ſtars had led me, a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, to this delightful ſolitude, without the leaſt idea of there being ſuch a place in our iſland, and as their malignant rays had forced me to offend, without intending it, I hoped they would pardon my breaking in upon them.</p>
               <p>To this the old Gentleman replied. You have not offended, Sir, I aſſure you, but are welcome to the <hi>Groves of Baſil.</hi> It gives me pleaſure to ſee you here; for it is very ſeldom we are favoured with any one's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0028500202:51"/>It is hard to diſcover or make out a road to this place, as we are ſurrounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt by impaſſable mountains, and a very dangerous moraſs: Nor can I conceive how you found the way here without a guide, or ventured to travel this country, as there are no towns in this part of the county. There muſt be ſomething very extraordinary in your caſe, and as you mentioned your being a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, I ſhould be glad to hear the cauſe of your journeying in this uninhabited region. But firſt (Mr. <hi>Henley</hi> ſaid) as it is now near eight at night, and you muſt want refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having met with no inn the whole day, we will go in to ſupper. He then aroſe, and brought me to an elegant parlour, where a table was ſoon covered with the beſt cold things, and we immediately ſat down. Every eatable was excellent, and the wine and other liquors in perfection. Miſs <hi>Henley</hi> ſat at the head of the table, her grandfather over-againſt her, and placed me at her right hand between them both. The young lady behaved in a very eaſy genteel manner; and the old gentleman, with freedom, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and good manners. 'Till nine this ſcene laſted, and then Mr. <hi>Henley</hi> again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted I would oblige him with an account of my travels in that part of the world. This I ſaid I would do in the beſt manner I could, and while he leaned back in his eaſy chair,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0028500202:52"/>and the beautiful <hi>Statia</hi> faſtened her glorious eyes upon me, I went on in the following words.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the author's hiſtory, from the beginning of his 17th year till his arrival at the groves of <hi>Baſil</hi> in 1727, in the 25th year of his age.</note>§. 7. I am an Engliſhman, Sir, but have paſſed the greateſt part of my life in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from the weſtern extremity of it I came. My father is one of the rich men in that kingdom, and was, for many years, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt and moſt generous parent that ever ſon was bleſſed with. He ſpared no coſt on my education, and gave me leave to draw upon him, while I reſided in the univerſity of <hi>Dublin</hi> five years, for what I pleaſed. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant as I was in ſeveral articles, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet any bounds to my demands, nor aſked me what I did with the large ſums I had yearly from him. My happineſs was his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and the glory of his life to have me appear to the greateſt advantage, and in the moſt reſpected character, that money can gain a man.</p>
               <p>But at laſt, he married his ſervant maid, an artful cruel woman, who obtained by her wit and charms ſo great an aſcendant over him, that he abandoned me, to raiſe a young nephew this ſtepmother had, to what ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and power ſhe pleaſed. He had every thing he could name that money could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and was abſolute maſter of the houſe and land. Not a ſhilling at this time could
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0028500202:53"/>I get, nor obtain the leaſt thing I aſked for, and becauſe I refuſed to become preceptor to this young man, and had made ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my religion, (having renounced that creed, which was compoſed, nobody knows by whom, and introduced into the church in the darkeſt ages of popiſh ignorance; a ſymbol, which ſtrongly participates of the true nature and ſpirit of popery, in thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere denunciations of God's wrath, which it pours ſo plentifully forth againſt all thoſe whoſe heads are not turned to believe it), my father was ſo enraged that he would not even admit me to his table any longer, but bid me be gone. My mother-in-law likewiſe for ever abuſed me, and her nephew, the lad, inſulted me when I came in his way.</p>
               <p>Being thus compelled to withdraw, I ſet ſail for <hi>England</hi> as ſoon as it was in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and arrived in <hi>Cumberland</hi> by the force of a ſtorm. I proceeded from thence to the mountains of <hi>Stanemore,</hi> to look for a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, my friend, who lived among thoſe hills; and as I journeyed over them, and miſſed him, I chanced to meet with a fine northern girl, and a habitation to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I married her, and for almoſt two years paſt was the happieſt of the human race, till the ſable curtain fell between us, and the angel of death tranſlated her glorious ſoul to the fields of paradiſe. Not able to bear the place of our reſidence, after I had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0028500202:54"/>loſt my heart's fond idol, I left the charming ſpot and manſion, where unmixed felicity had been for ſome time my portion, and I was travelling on towards <hi>London,</hi> to ſee what is ordained there in reſerve for me; when by accident I loſt my way, and the fates conducted me to the <hi>Groves</hi> of <hi>Baſil.</hi> Curioſity led me into the library I found in the plain, without this wood, from whence, in ſearch for ſome human creatures, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the fountain, where I had the pleaſure of ſeeing you, Sir, and this young lady. This is a ſummary of my paſt life; what is before me heaven only knows. My fortune I truſt with the Preſerver of men, and the Father of ſpirits. One thing I am certain of by obſervation, few as the days of the years of my pilgrimage have been, that the emptineſs, and unſatisfying nature of this world's enjoyments, are enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my having any fondneſs to ſtay in this region of darkneſs and ſorrow. I ſhall never leap over the bars of life, let what will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: but the ſooner I have leave to depart, I ſhall think it the better for me.</p>

The old gentleman ſeemed ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at my ſtory, and after ſome moments ſilence, when I had done, he ſaid, Your meaſure, Sir, is hard, and as it was, in part, for declaring againſt a falſe religion at your years, you pleaſe me ſo much, that if

She left us the moment we had done break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and then the old gentleman addreſſed himſelf to me in the following words.</p>
               <p>I do not forget the promiſe I made you, but muſt firſt relate the hiſtory of my family. I do it with the more pleaſure, as I find you are of our religion, and I cannot help hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a regard for you, on your daring to throw up a fortune for truth; for brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daring to renounce thoſe ſyſtems, which have an <hi>outward orthodox roundneſs</hi> given to them by their eloquent defenders, and <hi>within</hi> are <hi>mere corruption and apoſtacy.</hi>

The <hi>ſkeleton</hi> you ſaw in the library was once my ſon, <hi>Charles Henley,</hi> a moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary man. He had great abilities, and underſtood every thing a mortal is capable of knowing, of things human and divine.— When he was in his nineteenth year, I took him to <hi>France</hi> and other countries, to ſee the world, and, on our return to <hi>England,</hi> married him into a noble family, to a very valuable young woman, of a large fortune, and by her he had the young lady you ſaw ſitting on the chair near the table by me. This ſon I loſt, three years after his marriage, and with him all reliſh for the world: and being naturally inclined to retirement and a ſpeculative life, never ſtirred ſince from this country-houſe. Here my ſon devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entirely to ſtudy, and amuſed himſelf with inſtructing his beloved <hi>Statia,</hi> the young lady you have ſeen. At his death he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned her to my care; and as her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is very great, and her diſpoſition ſweet and charming, I have not only taken great pains in educating her, but have been delighted with my employment. Young as ſhe is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 14, 1727.</note> but in the ſecond month of her one and twentieth year, ſhe not only knows more than women of diſtinction generally do, but would be the admiration of learned men, if her knowledge in languages, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics, and philoſophy, were known to them: and as her father taught her muſic
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0028500202:57"/>and painting, perhaps there is not a young woman of finer accompliſhments in the kingdom.</p>
               <p>Her father died towards the end of the year 1723, in the 39th year of his age, when ſhe was not quite ſixteen, and, by his will, left her ten thouſand pounds, and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil-Houſe</hi> and eſtate; but ſhe is not to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it, or marry, 'till ſhe is two and twenty. This was her father's will. As to the <hi>ſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton</hi> in the library, it was my ſon's expreſs order it ſhould be ſo, and that the figure ſhould not be removed from the place it ſtands in, while the library remained in that room; but continue a ſolemn memorial in his family, to perpetuate his memory, and be a <hi>memento mori</hi> to the living.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Old Mr. <hi>Henley</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers me his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter in marriage.</note>§. 10. This is the hiſtory of <hi>Baſil Groves,</hi> and the late owner of this ſeat, and his daughter <hi>Statia.</hi> We live a happy, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life here, and enjoy every bleſſing that can be deſired in this lower hemiſphere. But as I am not very far from a hundred years, having paſſed that <hi>ninety-two</hi> which Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> ſays, he never knew any one he was acquainted with arrive at, I muſt be on the brink of the grave, and expect every day to drop into it. What may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>Statia,</hi> then, gives me ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think; as all her relations, except myſelf, are in the other world. To ſpend
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0028500202:58"/>her life here in this ſolitude, as ſeems to be her inclination, is not proper; and to go into the world by herſelf, when I am dead, without knowing any mortal in it, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve her in troubles and diſtreſſes. Hear then, my ſon, what I propoſe to you. You are a young man, but ſerious. You have got ſome wiſdom in the ſchool of affliction, and you have no averſion to matrimony, as you have juſt buried, you ſay, a glorious woman, your wife. If you will ſtay with us here, till <hi>Statia</hi> is two and twenty, and in that time render yourſelf agreeable to her, I promiſe you, ſhe ſhall be yours the day ſhe enters the three and twentieth year of her age, and you ſhall have with her fortune all that I am owner of, which is no ſmall ſum. What do you ſay to this propoſal?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">My reply.</note>§. 11. Sir, I replied, you do me vaſt honour, much more I am ſure than my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits can pretend to. I am infinitely obliged to you, and muſt be blind and inſenſible, if I refuſed ſuch a woman as Miſs <hi>Henley,</hi> were ſhe far from being the fortune ſhe is: But I have not vanity enough to imagine, I can gain her affections; eſpecially in my circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and to get her by your authority, or power of diſpoſing of her, is what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of. I will ſtay however, a few months here, ſince you ſo generouſly invite
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0028500202:59"/>me, and let Miſs <hi>Henley</hi> know, I will be her humble ſervant, if ſhe will allow me the honour of bearing that title. This made the old gentleman laugh, and he took me by the hand, ſaying, This is right. Come, let us go and take a walk before dinner.</p>

The mornings I generally ſpent in the library, reading, or writing extracts from ſome curious MSS. or ſcarce books; and in the afternoons Miſs <hi>Henley</hi> and I walked in the lawns and woods, or ſat down to cards. She was a fine creature indeed in body and ſoul, had a beautiful underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and charmed me to a high degree. Her converſation was rational and eaſy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt affectation from the books ſhe had read; and ſhe would enliven it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſinging, in which kind of muſic ſhe was as great a miſtreſs as I have heard. As to her heart, I found it was to be gained; but an accident happened that put a ſtop to the amour.</p>

In the beginning of March, the old gentleman, the excellent Mr. <hi>Henley, Statia</hi>'s grandfather and guardian, and my great friend, died, and by his death a great alteration enſued in my affair. I thought
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0028500202:60"/>to have had Miſs <hi>Henley</hi> immediately, as there was no one to plead her father's will againſt the marriage, and intended to ſend <hi>O Finn</hi> for Fryar <hi>Fleming;</hi> but when <hi>Statia</hi> ſaw herſelf her own miſtreſs, without any ſuperior, or controul, and in poſſeſſion of large fortunes, money, and an eſtate, that ſhe might do as ſhe pleaſed; this had an effect on her mind, and made a change. She told me, when I addreſſed myſelf to her, after her grandfather was interred, that what ſhe intended to do, in obedience to him, had he lived, ſhe thought required very ſerious conſideration now ſhe was left to herſelf: That, excluſive of this, her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination really was for a ſingle life; and had it been otherwiſe, yet it was not proper, ſince her guardian was dead, that I ſhould live with her till the time limited by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's will for her to marry was come; but that, as ſhe had too good an opinion of me, to imagine her fortune was what chiefly urged my application, and muſt own ſhe had a regard for me, ſhe would be glad to hear from me ſometimes, if I could think her worth remembring, after I had left the <hi>Groves of Baſil.</hi> This ſhe ſaid with great ſeriouſneſs, and ſeemed by her manner to forbid my urging the thing any further.</p>

                  <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was the firſt appointed token or memorial, and at the ſame time, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in that moral rectitude to which the grace of God obliges: and when the New Teſtament ſucceeded the Law, then was the <hi>covenant intereſt of infants,</hi> or their <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>covenant of grace,</hi> to be confirmed by the <hi>token</hi> or <hi>ſign</hi> called <hi>baptiſm;</hi> that action being appointed to give the expected riſing generation an intereſt in the love of God, the grace of Chriſt, and the fellowſhip of the Holy Spirit, that is, in all covenant bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. But what becomes of this great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of heaven, if chriſtian women, out of an idle notion of perfection, will reſolve to lead ſingle lives, and thereby hinder riſing generations from ſharing in the honours and privileges of the church of Jeſus Chriſt. Millions of the faithful muſt thereby be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the token inſtituted by God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to them thoſe covenant bleſſings, which his love and goodneſs deſigned for the riſing generations of his people. Have a care then
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0028500202:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>what you do, illuſtrious <hi>Statia,</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. It muſt be a great crime to hinder the regular propagation of a ſpecies, which God hath declared to be under his particular inſpection and bleſſing, and by circumciſion and baptiſm, hath made the ſpecial object of divine attention and care. Away then with all thoughts of a virgin life, whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of me. As God hath appointed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony and baptiſm, let it be your pious endeavour to bare ſons and daughters, that may be related to God, their Father; to Jeſus, their Redeemer, and firſt born in the family; and to all the excellent, who are to enjoy, through him, the bleſſings of the glorious world above. Marry, then, illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Statia,</hi> marry, and let the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> come upon us gentiles. Oppoſe not the goſpel covenant; that covenant which was made with that patriarch; but mind the comfortable promiſes; <hi>I will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed. I will pour out my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine offspring. The ſeed of the righteous is bleſſed. They are the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.</hi> Such is the magna charta of our exiſtence and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs; and as infants deſcending from <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the line of election, to the end of the world, have as good a right and claim as we to the bleſſings of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0028500202:64"/>and immenſe promiſe, <hi>I will be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee, in their generations;</hi> it muſt be a great crime, to deprive children of this intailed, heavenly inheritance, by our reſolving to live in a ſtate of virginity. In my opinion, it is a ſin greater than murder. What is murder, but forcing one from his poſt againſt the will of providence; and if the virgin hinders a being or beings from coming on the poſt, againſt the will of providence, muſt ſhe not be culpable; and muſt ſhe not be doubly criminal, if the being or beings ſhe hinders from coming on the ſtage, or into this firſt ſtate, were to be a part of the <hi>perpetual ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,</hi> who have a right to the <hi>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> the <hi>bleſſing,</hi> and were to be <hi>heirs</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>promiſe</hi> made to <hi>Abraham?</hi> Ponder, illuſtrious <hi>Statia,</hi> on the important point. Conſider what it is to die a maid, when you may, in a regular way, pruduce heirs to that ineſtimable bleſſing of life and favour, which the munificence of the Moſt High was pleaſed freely to beſtow, and which the great Chriſtian mediator, agent, and negociator, republiſhed, confirmed, and ſealed with his blood. Marry then in regard to the goſpel, and let it be the fine employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your life, to open gradually the treaſures of revelation to the underſtandings of the little chriſtians you produce.</p>

                     <p>Hear me then, ye <hi>libertines</hi> and <hi>maſs-prieſts:</hi> I call upon you of the firſt row, ye <hi>rakes of genius,</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what you are doing, and in time, turn from your iniquities: Be no longer profligate and licentious, blind to your true intereſt and happineſs, but become virtuous and honourable lovers, and in regard to the advantages of this <hi>ſolemn inſtitution,</hi> called <hi>wedlock,</hi> as well to the general ſtate of the world, as to individuals, <hi>marry in the Lord;</hi> ſo will you avoid that dreadful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Fornicators and adulterers God will judge,</hi> that is, puniſh; and in this life, you may make things <hi>very agreeable,</hi> if you pleaſe; though it is in the heavenly world alone, where there ſhall be all joy and no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

It is poſſible, I am ſure, to make marriage productive of as much happineſs as falls to our ſhare in this lower hemiſphere; as the nature of man can reach to in his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0028500202:68"/>For, as to joy flowing in with a full, conſtant and equal tide, without interruption and without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, there is no ſuch thing.

                     <p>In the next place, ye <hi>monks,</hi> I would perſuade you, if I could, to labour no longer in ſtriving to cancel the obligations to marriage by the pretence of religion. The voice of heaven, and the whiſpers of ſound and uncorrupted reaſon are againſt it. It is will-worſhip in oppoſition to revelation. It is ſuch a preſumption for a creature againſt the author of our nature, as muſt draw down uncommon wrath upon the head of every <hi>maſs-prieſt,</hi> who does not repent their preaching ſuch wicked doctrine. Indeed I do not know any part of popery that can be called chriſtianity: but this in particular is ſo horrible and diabolical, that I can conſider the preachers for celibacy in no other light than as ſo many <hi>devils.</hi> May you ponder in time on this horrible affair.</p>

From thence I ſet out for <hi>Harrigate,</hi> to amuſe myſelf in that agreeable place; but I did not go the way I came to Mr. <hi>Henley</hi>'s houſe. To avoid the dangerous moraſs I had paſſed, at the hazard of my life, we went over a wilder and more romantic country than I had before ſeen. We had higher mountains to aſcend than I had ever paſſed before; and ſome vallies ſo very deep to ride through, that they ſeemed as it were deſcents to hell.

Through theſe ſcenes, an amazing mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the terrible and the beautiful, we proceeded from five in the morning till one in the afternoon, when we arrived at a vaſt water-fall, which deſcended from a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice near two hundred yards high, into a deep lake, that emptied itſelf into a ſwallow fifty yards from the catadure or fall, and went I ſuppoſe to the abyſs. The land from this head-long river, for half a mile in length and breadth, till it ended at vaſt mountains again, was a fine piece of ground, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully flowered with various perennials, the acanthus, the aconus, the adonis or phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant's eye, the purple biſtorta, the blue bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago, the yellow bupthalmum, the white cacalia, the blue campanula, and the ſweet-ſmelling caſſia, the pretty double daiſy, the crimſon dianthus, the white dictamnus, the red fruximella, and many other wild flowers. They make the green valley look charming; and as here and there ſtood two or three ever-green trees, the cypreſs, the larix, the balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and the <hi>Swediſh</hi> juniper, the whole ſpot has a fine and delightful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0028500202:72"/>inhabitants in it. I found they were a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſociety of married people, ten friars and their ten wives, who had agreed to retire to this ſtill retreat, and form a holy houſe on the plan of the famous <hi>Ivon,</hi> the diſciple of <hi>Labadie,</hi> ſo celebrated on account of his connection with Mrs. <hi>Schurman,</hi> and his many fanatical writings.<note n="*" place="margin">See my 1ſt volume, p. 347. where you will find a particular account of <hi>Labadie</hi> and <hi>Ivon.</hi>
                  </note> A book called the <hi>Marriage Chretien,</hi> written by this <hi>Ivon,</hi> was their directory, and from it they formed a proteſtant <hi>La Trappe;</hi> with this difference from the Catholic religious men, that the friars of the reformed monaſtery were to have wives in their convent; the better to enable them to obtain Chriſtian perfection in the religious life. Theſe Regulars, men and women, were a moſt induſtrious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, never idle; but between their hours of prayer always at work: the men were employed in a garden of ten acres, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide vegetables and fruit, on which they chiefly lived; or in cutting down old trees, and fitting them for their fire: and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were knitting, ſpinning, or twiſting what they had ſpun into thread, which they ſold for three ſhillings a pound: they were all together in a large, handſome room: they ſat quite ſilent, kept their eyes on their work, and ſeemed more attentive to ſome inward meditations, than to any thing that appeared, or paſſed by them. They looked
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0028500202:73"/>as if they were contented and happy. They were all extremely handſome, and quite clean: their linen fine and white: their gowns a black ſtuff. The women dined at one table: the men at another; but all ſat in the ſame room. The whole houſe was in bed by ten, and up by four in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, winter and ſummer. What they ſaid at their table I could not hear, as they ſpoke low and little, and were at a diſtance from me, in a large apartment: but the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the men, at table, was very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, rational and improving. I obſerved they had a great many children, and kept four women-ſervants to attend them, and do the work of the houſe. The whole pleaſed me very greatly. I thought it a happy inſtitution.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Some thoughts on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of married regulars.</note>§. 3. As to the <hi>marriage</hi> of the <hi>friars</hi> in this cloyſtral houſe, their founder, <hi>Ivon,</hi> in my opinion, was quite right in this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Chaſte junction</hi> cannot have the leaſt imperfection in it, as it is the appointment of God, and the inclination to a <hi>coit</hi> is ſo ſtrongly impreſſed on the machine by the author of it; and ſince it is quite pure and perfect; ſince it was wiſely intended as the only beſt expedient to keep man for ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, it muſt certainly be much better for a <hi>regular</hi> or <hi>retreating prieſt,</hi> to have a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0028500202:74"/>female companion with him; and ſo the woman, who chuſes a convent, and diſlikes the faſhions of the world, to have her good and lawful monk every night in her arms; to love and procreate legally, when they have performed all the holy offices of the day; and then, from love and holy generation, return again to prayer, and all the heavenly duties of the cloyſtered life; than to live, againſt the inſtitution of nature and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a <hi>burning, tortured nun,</hi> and a <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tortured friar;</hi> locked up in walls they can never paſs, and under the government of ſome old, croſs, impotent ſuperior. There is ſome ſenſe in ſuch a <hi>marriage chretien</hi> in a convent. <hi>Ivon's</hi> convent is well enough. A cloyſter may do upon his plan, with the dear creature by ones ſide, after the daily labours of the <hi>monk</hi> are over. It had been better, if that <hi>infallible</hi> man, the <hi>Pope,</hi> had come into this ſcheme. How comfortable has <hi>Ivon</hi> made it to the human race, who renounce the dreſs and pageantry, and all the vanities of time. Their days are ſpent in piety and uſefulneſs; and at night, after the <hi>completo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> they lie down together in the moſt heavenly charity, and according to the firſt great hail, endeavour to increaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. This is a divine life. I am for a cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter on theſe terms. It pleaſed me ſo much
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0028500202:75"/>to ſee theſe <hi>monks</hi> march off with their ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling partners, after the laſt pſalm, that I could not help wiſhing for a charmer there, that I might commence the <hi>Married Regular,</hi> and add to the ſtock of children in this holy houſe. It is really a fine thing to <hi>monk</hi> it on this plan. It is a divine inſtitution: gentle and generous, uſeful and pious.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, how <hi>cruel</hi> is the <hi>Roman church,</hi> to make <hi>perfection</hi> conſiſt in <hi>celibacy,</hi> and cauſe ſo many millions of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to live at an eternal diſtance from each other, without the leaſt regard to the given points of contact! How unfriendly to ſociety! This is abuſing chriſtianity, and perverting it to the moſt pernicious purpoſes; under a pretence of raiſing piety, by giving more time and leiſure for devotion. For it never can be pious either in deſign or practice, to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel any moral obligation, or to make void any command of God: and as to prayer, it may go along with every other duty, and be performed in every ſtate.

                           <p>ALMIGHTY and everlaſting God, the creator and preſerver of all things, our law-giver, ſaviour, and judge, we adore thee the author of our beings, and the father of our ſpirits. We preſent ourſelves, our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, and our homage, at the foot of thy throne, and yield thee the thanks of the moſt grateful hearts for all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thy favour which we have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced. We thank thee for ever, O Lord God Almighty, for all thy mercies and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0028500202:78"/>vouchſafed us; for defending us the paſt night from evil, and for that kind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which thou haſt made for our comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſubſiſtence in this world.</p>
                           <p>But above all, moſt glorious Eternal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored be thy goodneſs, for repeating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcing the laws and the religion of thy creation, by ſupernatural revelation, and for giving us that reaſon of mind, which unites us to thee, and makes us implore thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of righteouſneſs, to create us again unto good works in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                           <p>We confeſs, O Lord, that we have done violence to our principles, and alienated our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the natural uſe we were fitted for: we have revolted from thee into a ſtate of ſin, and by the operation of ſenſe and paſſion, have been moved to ſuch practices as are exorbitant and irregular: but we are heartily ſorry for all our miſdoings: to thee in Chriſt we now make our addreſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to inform our underſtandings, and refine our ſpirits, that we may reform our lives by repentance, redeem our time by righteouſneſs, and live as the glorious goſpel of thy Son requires. Let the divine ſpirit aſſiſt and enable us to over-rule, conduct, and employ, the ſubordinate and inferior powers, in the exerciſe of virtue, and the ſervice of our creator, and as far as the imperfections of our preſent ſtate will admit,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0028500202:79"/>help us ſo to live by the meaſures and laws of heaven, that we may have the humility and meekneſs, the mortification and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the holy Jeſus, his love of thee, his deſire of doing thy will, and ſeeking only thy honour. Let us not come covered before thee under a <hi>form</hi> of godlineſs, a <hi>cloke</hi> of creeds, obſervances and inſtitutions of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but with that <hi>inward ſalvation</hi> and <hi>vital ſanctity,</hi> which renounces the ſpirit, wiſdom, and honours of this world, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrones ſelf-love and pride, ſubdues ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and covetouſneſs, and <hi>opens a kingdom of heaven within</hi> by the ſpirit of God. O let thy Chriſt be our Saviour in this world; and before we die, make us fit to live for ever with thee in the regions of purity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                           <p>Since it is the peculiar privilege of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, through thy mercy and goodneſs, that we are made for an eternal entertainment in thoſe glorious manſions, where the bleſſed ſociety of ſaints and angels ſhall keep an everlaſting ſabbath, and adore and glorify thee for ever, let thy inſpiring ſpirit raiſe our apprehenſions and deſires above all things that are here below, and alienate our minds from the cuſtoms and principles of this mad, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and apoſtate world: mind us of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of time, of the boundleſs duration, and the vaſt importance
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0028500202:80"/>of eternity, and ſo enable us to imitate the example of the holy Jeſus in this world, that we may hereafter aſcend, with the greateſt ardor of divine love, to thoſe realms of holineſs, where our hearts will be filled with raptures of gladneſs and joy, and we ſhall remain in the higheſt glory for ever and ever.</p>
                           <p>We live, O Lord, in reconciliation and friendſhip, in love and good will, with thy whole creation, with every thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from thee, holds of thee, is owned by thee; and under the power of this affection, we pray for all mankind; that they may be partakers of all the bleſſings which we enjoy or want, and that we may all be happy in the world to come, and glorify thee together in eternity. To this end bring all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race to the knowledge of thy glorious goſpel, and let its influence transform them into the likeneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>But eſpecially, we pray for all who ſuffer for truth and righteouſneſs ſake, and beſeech thee to proſper thoſe that love thee. Defend, O Lord, the juſt rights and liberties of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and reſcue thy religion from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which have been introduced upon it, by length of time, and by decay of piety. Infatuate the counſels, and fruſtrate the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the prieſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> and againſt all the deſigns of thoſe, who are enemies to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0028500202:81"/>the purity of the goſpel, and ſubſtitute hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inventions in the place of revealed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; proſper the pious labours of thoſe who teach mankind to worſhip one, eternal and omnipreſent being; in whoſe underſtanding, there is the perfection of wiſdom; in whoſe will, there is the perfection of goodneſs; in whoſe actions, there is the perfection of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; a God without cauſe, the great creator, benefactor, and ſaviour of men:—And that the duty of man is to obey, in thought, word, and deed, the precepts of godlineſs and righteouſneſs, without regard to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, gain, or honour; to pain, loſs, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; diligently imitating the life of the holy Jeſus, and ſtedfaſtly confiding in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation.</p>
                           <p>In the laſt place, O Lord God.

Upon thee our God, we call for that help which is never wanting, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to give us thy heavenly aſſiſtance, that we may recover our reaſonable nature, refine our ſpirits by goodneſs, and purify our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves even as the Lord Jeſus is pure. O thou Father of Lights, and the God of all comforts, inform our underſtandings with truth, and give us one ray of that divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which ſitteth on the right hand of thy throne. O let us be always under thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication

Upon my aſking one of theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, how they came to differ ſo much from <hi>Ivon,</hi> their founder, and ceaſe to be the patrons of viſion, and an implicit incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible faith? He told me, they had read all the books on both ſides of the queſtion, that had been written of late years, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0028500202:85"/>could not reſiſt the force of the evidence in favour of reaſon and the divine unity. They ſaw it go againſt mechanical impulſe, and ſtrong perſuaſion without grounds, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they diſmiſſed <hi>Ivon</hi>'s notions of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without ideas, as they became ſenſible it was the ſame thing as ſeeing without light or objects. Without dealing any longer in a miſt of words, or ſhewing themſelves ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, by empty, inſignificant ſounds, they reſolved, that the object of their worſhip, for the time to come, ſhould be, that one ſupreme ſelf-exiſtent being, of abſolute, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfection, who is the firſt cauſe of all things, and whoſe numerical identity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfections are demonſtrable from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain principles of reaſon, antecedent to any peculiar revelation;—and confeſſed that the <hi>bleſſing,</hi> with which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was <hi>ſent</hi> by <hi>God</hi> to bleſs the world, conſiſts in <hi>turning men from their iniquities.</hi> They now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what the <hi>creed-makers,</hi> and <hi>Ivon,</hi> their founder, could not ſee, to wit, that it is againſt the <hi>ſacred texts,</hi> to aſcribe to Each Perſon of Three the nature and all eſſential attributes and properties of the One only true God, and yet make the Three the One true God only, when conſidered conjunctly; for if Each has all poſſible perfections and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, then <hi>Each</hi> muſt be the <hi>ſame true God</hi> as if and when <hi>conjoined;</hi> and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0028500202:86"/>there muſt then be <hi>Three One true Gods,</hi> or <hi>One Three true Gods;</hi> Three One Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Beings, or One Three Supreme Beings, ſince to <hi>each</hi> of the three muſt be aſcribed (as the orthodox ſay) <hi>any thing</hi> and <hi>every thing,</hi> that is moſt <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>appropriated</hi> to the <hi>divine nature,</hi> without any difference. In ſhort, by conjobbling matters of faith in this manner, they ſaw, we had <hi>three diſtinct ſelfs,</hi> or intelligent agents, equal in power and all poſſible perfections, agreeing in one common eſſence, one ſort of ſpecies, (like a ſupreme magiſtracy of diſtinct perſons, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a joint exerciſe of the ſame power) and ſo the <hi>three</hi> are <hi>one,</hi> not by a <hi>numerical</hi> but <hi>ſpecific</hi> identity; <hi>three Omnipotents</hi> and <hi>one Almighty,</hi> in a collective ſenſe. This, (continued this gentleman) on ſearching the ſcriptures, we found was far from being the truth of the caſe. We diſcovered, upon a fair examination, and laying aſide our old prejudices, that there was nothing like this in the New Teſtament. It appeared to us to be the confuſed talk of weak heads. In the Bible we got a juſt idea of One Eternal Cauſe, God the Father, <hi>almighty, all-wiſe, unchangeable, infinite;</hi> and are there taught how to worſhip and ſerve him.

We ſhould invite men into our religion, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to them the <hi>perfection</hi> of that <hi>primary law</hi> of God, <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>natural religion;</hi> by declaring the plainneſs and clearneſs of it to all attentive and well-diſpoſed minds; and then ſhew them how worthy it was of the Supreme Governor to give ſuch creatures as he has made us the goſpel: that by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of favour, he has, with glory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, diſplayed his paternal regard for us, by doing much more than what is <hi>ſtrictly neceſſary</hi> for our eternal good. God, on a principle of love, ſends his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to adviſe us and awaken us to a ſenſe of our danger in paſſing through this world, in caſe (which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0028500202:90"/>he ſaw would be the thing) we ſhould not conſtantly attend to the light we might ſtrike out ourſelves with ſome trouble. He calls us in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> manner to forſake vice and idolatry, and practiſe the whole ſyſtem of morality. We might expect, that a good God, would once at leaſt, interpoſe by ſuch an <hi>extraordinary</hi> method as <hi>revelation,</hi> to turn and incline his reaſonable creatures, to the ſtudy and practice of the <hi>religion of nature.</hi> This was acting like the Father of the Univerſe, conſidering the negligence and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the bulk of mankind. The <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> he gave us, the <hi>law of nature,</hi> was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us all that was <hi>abſolutely neceſſary.</hi> The <hi>goſpel</hi> was an addition of what is <hi>excellently uſeful.</hi> What, my beloved, (might a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal divine ſay) can be more paternal, and worthy of the almighty Creator, than to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal plainly the motive of a judgment to come,</hi> in order to ſecure all obedience to the religion of nature? Reaſon may, to be ſure, be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſhew men their duty, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their performance of it with the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of obtaining a reward, if they would duly attend to its dictates, and ſuffer them to have their due effect upon them: it may guide mankind to virtue, and happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to it, as God muſt be a rewarder of all thoſe who diligently ſeek him, and was enough to bring them to the knowledge, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0028500202:91"/>engage them in the practice of true religion and righteouſneſs, if they had not ſhut their eyes to its light, and wilfully rejected the rule written in their hearts. But as this was what mankind really did, and now do; as errors and impieties, owing to an undue uſe or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of reaſon, became univerſal; (juſt as the caſe of Chriſtians is, by diſregarding the New Teſtament); and reaſon, through men's faults, was rendered <hi>ineffectual,</hi> though ſtill <hi>ſufficient,</hi> (which juſtifies both the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God, in leaving man for ſo many ages to his natural will, and ſo great a part of the globe to this day with no other light than the law of nature); and reaſon, I ſay, was rendered <hi>ineffectual,</hi> tho' ſtill <hi>ſufficient</hi> to teach men to worſhip God with pious hearts and ſincere affections, and to do his will by the practice of moral duties; to expect his favour for their good deeds, and his condemnation of their evil works; then was <hi>revelation</hi> a more <hi>powerful means</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting true religion and godlineſs. The goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is a <hi>more effectual</hi> light. It is a clearer and more powerful guide: a brighter motive and ſtronger obligation to univerſal obedience than reaſon can with certainty propoſe. And therefore, though there was not a neceſſity for God to give a <hi>new rule</hi> in vindication of his providence, and in order to render men accountable to him for their actions; yet the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0028500202:92"/>divine goodneſs was pleaſed to enforce the principles of reaſon and morality more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully by an expreſs ſanction of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, and by the goſpel reſtore religious worſhip to the original un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted rational ſervice of the Deity. This diſplays his paternal regard to his children, with glory to himſelf. Love was the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle of his ſending Chriſt into the world, to reform the corruptions of reaſon, to reſtore it to its purity, and moſt effectually to promote the practice of the rules of it. The goſpel-revelation conſidered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appears to be the pure effect of the divine goodneſs. It is a conduct accompanied with the greateſt propriety and glory.</p>
               <p>If this repreſentation of Chriſtianity was as much the doctrine of the church as it is of the <hi>Ivonites</hi> I have mentioned, we might then, with hopes of ſucceſs, call upon the rational infidels to come in. They could hardly refuſe the invitation, when we told them, our religion was the eternal law of <hi>reaſon</hi> and of God reſtored, with a few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently uſeful additions: that the goſpel makes the very <hi>religion of nature,</hi> a main part of what it requires, and ſubmits all that it reveals to the teſt of the law of reaſon: that the ſplendor of God's <hi>original light,</hi> the light of nature, and the revelation of Jeſus, are the ſame; both made to deliver mankind
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0028500202:93"/>from <hi>evils</hi> and <hi>madneſs</hi> of <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> and make their religion worthy of God, and worthy of men; to enable them, by the voice of reaſon in conjunction with the words of the goſpel, to know and worſhip <hi>One God,</hi> the <hi>Maker,</hi> the <hi>Governor,</hi> the <hi>Judge,</hi> of the world; and to practiſe all that is good and praiſe-worthy: that we may be bleſſed as we turn from iniquity to virtue; and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring cordially into the ſpirit of the <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious example</hi> or <hi>exemplary merits</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be determined dead to ſin, and alive to righteouſneſs: in ſhort, my brethren, in the ſuffering and death of Jeſus, his patient, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and meek, his benevolent and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate behaviour, under the moſt ſhocking inſult, indignity, and torture, we have what we could not learn from the religion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a deportment that well deſerves both our admiration and imitation. We learn from the <hi>perfect example</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in his goſpel, to bear patiently ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſage, and to deſire the welfare of our moſt unreaſonable and malicious enemies. This is improving by religion to the beſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and as we reſemble the Son of God, the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> in <hi>patience, piety,</hi> and <hi>benevolence,</hi> we become the approved chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Moſt High, who is kind and good to the unthankful and to the evil. In this view of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> all is fine, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0028500202:94"/>and heavenly. The gentile can have nothing to object. We have the religion of nature in its original perfection, in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the New Teſtament, enforced by pains and pleaſures everlaſting; and we learn from the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> not only an unprecedented patience, in bearing our ſins in his own body on the tree; but the divine compaſſion and piety with which he bore them. We have in this the nobleſt example to follow, whenever called to ſuffer for well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, or for righteouſneſs-ſake; and by the imitation, we manifeſt ſuch a command of temper and ſpirit, as can only be the reſult of the greateſt piety and virtue. This added to keeping the commandments muſt render men the bleſſed of the Father, and entitle them to the kingdom prepared for the wife, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and the excellent.</p>
               <p>But, alas! inſtead of giving ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of chriſtianity, the cry of the doctors is, for the moſt part, Diſcard reaſon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate your underſtanding before the adorable myſteries. Inſtead of a Supreme Independent Firſt Cauſe of all things to believe in and worſhip, they give Three true Gods in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Three infinite independent Beings, to be called One, as agreeing in one common ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract eſſence, or ſpecies; as all mankind are one, in one common rational nature, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract idea of humanity. Amazing account!
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0028500202:95"/>A triune no infidel or gentile of ſenſe will ever worſhip.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of fixing ſalvation or moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and our preferring the will of God, as delineated in the words of the goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other conſiderations, we are told of an innocent, meritorious, propitiating blood, ſpilt by wicked hands, and ſo made an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifice, to a Being who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. This, we are aſſured, ſatisfies all the demands of the law. Here is infinite ſatisfaction:—and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, I add, a cool indifference as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal rectitude. When ſuch a faith or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity becomes the principal pillar of truſt and dependance, then mere reliance on ſuch ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, may be a ſtupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opiate, and make many remiſs in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of a penitential piety, and that exact rectitude of mind and life, which even reaſon requires, to render us acceptable to the Deity. Many an appetite and paſſion are indulged under this ſubterfuge; and with little fervency or zeal for good works, men expect to partake of the heavenly joys, by truſting to the merits of their Saviour, in their laſt will and teſtament. Deplorable caſe! Alas! how has Chriſtianity ſuffered by its doctors! The infidel laughs at it as thus preached. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a by-word, and a hiſſing to them that paſs by.</p>

William Grimaud, abbot</hi> of <hi>St. Victor de Marſeille,</hi> on his being made <hi>Pope Urban</hi> the 5th, A.

His works are 183 letters on various ſubjects, 20 ſermons, and 17 tracts of ſeveral kinds. They were firſt printed at <hi>Mayence</hi> in 1500.— Then by <hi>Merlin, Paris,</hi> 1519, as before mentioned.— Afterwards, <hi>John Buſée,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> gave an edition of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0028500202:100"/>them in 1600, which is far preferable to that of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi> But the moſt valuable edition is that of <hi>Peter de Gouſſainville,</hi> in folio, <hi>Paris,</hi> 1667: to this edition is prefixed the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Peter de Blois,</hi> and very learned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>writings,</hi> and the ſubjects he writ on, are added, by <hi>Gouſſainville. De Blois</hi>'s works contain many excellent things, and his life is a curious piece. Some of his notions relating to the ſcriptures are very good, and he writes well againſt vice. He is a good author for the age he lived in. His letters are well worth reading; eſpecially ſuch of them as relate to his own time. King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond ordered him to make a collection of them for his (the king's) uſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Durand de St. Pourçain,</hi> was <hi>biſhop</hi> of <hi>Meux,</hi> in 1326, and died the 13th of <hi>September,</hi> 1333, in the 89th year of his age. His works are, <hi>Liber de origine juriſdictionum,</hi> (a learned piece); and <hi>Commentaries on the four books of ſentences.</hi> (The book called, <hi>The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> was written by the famous <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who died in the year 1164. aet. 82. In the <hi>Sentences,</hi> one of the propoſitions argued on is this: <hi>Chriſtus ſecundum quod eſt homo, non eſt aliquod.</hi> Some call theſe <hi>Sentences</hi> excellent, which is what I cannot think them: but in <hi>Durand's Commentary</hi> on them, there are ſeveral excellent things.)</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Jeſuit, Jean Buſée,</hi> (who publiſhed the 3d edition of <hi>Peter de Blois</hi>) he died at <hi>Mayence</hi> the 30th of <hi>May,</hi> 1611, aged 64, and was the author of many books not worth mentioning.</p>
                     <p>The learned <hi>Gouſſainville</hi> (who printed the laſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>De Blois,</hi> with notes, and the life) died in the year 1683, extremely poor and miſerable. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0028500202:101"/>publiſhed the works of <hi>St. Gregory,</hi> the firſt pope of that name, with many valuable remarks and notes. There are four editions of this pope's works; that of <hi>Tuſſiniani,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Venice,</hi> by order of pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5th: the <hi>Paris</hi> edition, 1640: <hi>Gouſſainville</hi>'s edition: and the late <hi>Benedictine</hi> edition: but <hi>Gouſſainville</hi>'s is, in my opinion, the moſt valuable.</p>
                     <p>N. B. The <hi>Sermons</hi> in the firſt and ſecond editions of <hi>Peter de Blois</hi>' works, are not his, but <hi>Peter Comeſtor's.

Note, <hi>Peter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtor</hi> was a regular canon of <hi>St. Victor</hi>'s in <hi>Paris,</hi> and died in the year 1198, aet. 65.—Beſides the ſermons publiſhed by miſtake as the work of <hi>De Blois,</hi> he writ a large <hi>ſcholaſtic hiſtory,</hi> which comprehends the ſacred hiſtory from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the end of the <hi>Acts.</hi> This is reckoned a good thing; and has been abridged by one <hi>Hunter,</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman.</hi>

This paſſage of <hi>Cyril</hi> I have heard ſeveral learned Roman Catholic gentlemen call a <hi>prayer,</hi> and affirm it was a <hi>proof</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's

               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Binius,</hi> though a zealous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the <hi>catholic cauſe,</hi> (as the <hi>monks</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> miſcall it) was of another opinion, for he takes no notice of this paſſage in his notes (in calce part. 3, Concil, Epheſini, tom. 2. p. 665, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and moſt certainly, he would not have failed to urge it, if he had conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as a prayer, and believed it did prove the invocation of ſaints.</p>

2.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As <hi>rhetorical apoſtrophes,</hi> or <hi>proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paeias,</hi> are uſual in all authors, ſacred or civil, this may be one in <hi>Cyril,</hi> and it ſeems very plain from the paſſage, that it was intended for no more. It appears to be a <hi>rhetorical figure,</hi> and not a <hi>prayer;</hi> ſuch a figure as the Greek fathers were wont very frequently to uſe in their orations and poems.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyril</hi> intending, as appears by the ſequel, to anſwer his own queſtion with a paſſage in St. <hi>John</hi>'s goſpel, makes a long <hi>rhetorical apoſtrophe</hi> to the <hi>apoſtle,</hi> as if he were there preſent, then adds, Annon dicentem audimus, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>? <hi>But do we not hear him ſaying?</hi> Or, as <hi>Binius</hi> has the reading, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>let us hear what St. John ſaith,</hi> audiamus itaque dicentem, as if they had heard <hi>John</hi> giving his anſwer, and then concludes with the firſt verſe of the firſt chapter of his goſpel, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. In the beginning was the word,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is therefore very plain, that this paſſage of <hi>Cyril</hi> is only a part of his homily or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0028500202:107"/>and that in a rhetorical manner, he quotes a text from a goſpel written by <hi>John</hi> about 330 years before, in anſwer to his own queſtion, who the word was? For <hi>Cyril</hi> to pray to <hi>John</hi> to tell them what he had told them long before, were ſenſeleſs and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; but to deſire the apoſtle to do it in a <hi>rhetorical apoſtrophe,</hi> was allowable. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more than the figurative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in our liturgy, <hi>Hear what comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words our Saviour ſaith. Hear what St. Paul ſaith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if <hi>Cyril</hi> did in this paſſage truly pray to St. <hi>John,</hi> that could be no argument for <hi>popiſh invocation</hi> of <hi>ſaints;</hi> for, if an <hi>hundred fathers</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>fourth</hi> century, had preached up, and practiſed <hi>invocation of ſaints,</hi> yet that could not make it lawful and right, ſince we are taught by the <hi>ſcriptures</hi> to direct our prayers neither to <hi>ſaint no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> but to <hi>God only,</hi> and in the name and <hi>mediation of Jeſus Chriſt only.</hi> We are not only poſitively ordered by the <hi>apoſtles</hi> to make all our addreſſes and prayers ot <hi>God only,</hi> and by the <hi>mediation and interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but are told, that God is <hi>omniſcient,</hi> and ſo <hi>able to hear all our prayers; — all-ſufficient,</hi> and therefore <hi>able to ſupply all our neceſſities;</hi> —and that his <hi>mercies in Jeſus Chriſt are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</hi> This makes <hi>our way ſure</hi> in this particular.</p>

On the contrary, the <hi>papiſts</hi> have no <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>ſaints;</hi> nor <hi>any promiſe</hi> that they ſhall be <hi>heard;</hi> nor any <hi>practice</hi> of the primitive church, for 300 years after Chriſt, to <hi>encourage</hi> them; and therefore, ſuch <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh invocation</hi> is a <hi>novel, groundleſs,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious error.</hi>

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0028500202:109"/>he is now in heaven exalted to, as much as in men lies, that I ſhould have admired how it ever came to be embraced by ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs chriſtianity, had not the ſpirit of God foretold (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 4.) that <hi>ſome ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits,</hi> (that is, ſeducing men) and <hi>doctrines of devils,</hi> that is to ſay, doctrines concerning <hi>demons,</hi> or <hi>ſouls of famous men departed this life;</hi> which the heathens called <hi>demons;</hi> and to whom they gave the worſhip of prayer or invocation, as interceſſors or inferior divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This prophecy hinders my wondering at the thing: but then I muſt call ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern invocation <hi>gentiliſm chriſtianized;</hi> a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ponder then, ye <hi>Catholics,</hi> in time, and think not to excuſe yourſelves by arguing from the <hi>command Chriſtians have here on earth to require each others prayers to God for them:</hi>—For, we have no command to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate any in heaven but only God. (<hi>Matt.</hi> vi. 8.) We have no reaſonable aſſurance that the <hi>ſaints in heaven do hear our prayers,</hi> and of conſequence have not the ſame <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to requeſt <hi>their</hi> prayers to God for us that we have to requeſt the prayers of <hi>ſaints on earth:</hi> nor is this all: our <hi>prayers</hi> to each other in this life are only chriſtian <hi>requeſts</hi> to recommend our conditions to God: <hi>offices</hi> only of <hi>kindneſs:</hi> no <hi>acts of religious worſhip.</hi>

When St. <hi>Paul</hi> was on earth, had any one on <hi>bended knees,</hi> with <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>eyes lifted up to heaven,</hi> in time of <hi>public prayer,</hi> and amidſt the <hi>ſolemn prayers to God,</hi> beſeeched him for <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>help,</hi> and for the <hi>conference</hi> of <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> he would have <hi>rent his cloathes,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Why do ye theſe things?</hi> and can we ſuppoſe, that now in heaven, the apoſtle is leſs careful to preſerve entire <hi>God's prerogative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide, there is a great deal of difference betwixt St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Brethren, pray for us,</hi> or our requeſting the prayers of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful here on earth for us, and <hi>praying to ſaints in heaven,</hi> as <hi>practiſed</hi> in the <hi>Roman church. Our</hi>'s, are only <hi>wiſhes</hi> and <hi>requeſts; their</hi>'s, <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayers</hi> on bended knees, made in the <hi>places</hi> and proper ſeaſons of <hi>divine worſhip,</hi> and joined with the <hi>prayers</hi> they make <hi>to God.</hi> They uſe the ſame <hi>poſtures</hi> and <hi>expreſſions</hi> of devotions they uſe to God himſelf. They pray to them for <hi>help</hi> and <hi>aid,</hi> and make them <hi>joint-petitioners</hi> with Chriſt; relying on <hi>their merits</hi> as the <hi>merits of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſum, in the <hi>tabernacle</hi> of <hi>this world,</hi> we are to requeſt the prayers of every good chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian for us: but in the <hi>tabernacle</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> we are to <hi>call on none</hi> but <hi>Him</hi> in <hi>whom we believe.</hi> As in the <hi>outward court</hi> of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh tabernacle,</hi> every <hi>prieſt</hi> was permitted to officiate, to receive and preſent the devotions
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0028500202:111"/>of the people to the divine majeſty; but in the <hi>holy place, within the vail,</hi> none but the <hi>high-prieſt</hi> was to do any <hi>office</hi> or <hi>ſervice:</hi> even ſo in the <hi>tabernacle</hi> of <hi>this world,</hi> every chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian being a <hi>prieſt</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> has this honour conferred upon him; but in the <hi>holy of holies,</hi> in <hi>heaven,</hi> none but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our <hi>high-prieſt,</hi> is to <hi>officiate.</hi> He only is there to <hi>appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> It is <hi>his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive alone</hi> to receive our prayers, and preſent them to the divine majeſty. As none but the <hi>high-prieſt</hi> was to offer <hi>incenſe</hi> in the <hi>holy of holies,</hi> ſo none in heaven but <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>high-prieſt</hi> is to <hi>offer</hi> our prayers to <hi>God his father.</hi> He alone is that <hi>angel</hi> to whom <hi>much incenſe was given, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all ſaints, upon the golden altar that was before the throne.</hi> (Rev. viii. 3.) Which alludes to the <hi>altar</hi> that was before the <hi>mercy-ſeat,</hi> on which the <hi>high-prieſt</hi> only was to offer <hi>incenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>catholic</hi> may ſay perhaps, that as on earth, men do not preſently run to <hi>kings</hi> to <hi>preſent</hi> their <hi>requeſts,</hi> but obtain his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by the <hi>mediation</hi> of <hi>courtiers</hi> and <hi>favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;</hi> even ſo, it is fitting we have recourſe to ſaints, who are <hi>favourites</hi> in heaven, that we may obtain <hi>acceſs</hi> to God, and have our <hi>ſuits</hi> accepted of him. Thus have I heard ſome learned men of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> argue. They ſhould conſider, however, in the firſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0028500202:112"/>place, that if an <hi>earthly prince</hi> had declared he would have no <hi>ſollicitor</hi> but his <hi>ſon,</hi> and that all <hi>favours</hi> and <hi>royal graces</hi> ſhould come to his <hi>ſubjects through his hands,</hi> and by means of his <hi>mediation;</hi> ſuch ſubjects could deſerve no favour, if they make their application to <hi>other favourites,</hi> contrary to their prince's command.—In the next place, if the <hi>ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor,</hi> the <hi>ſon,</hi> was out of the queſtion, and no ſuch one had been declared by the king, yet as we petition earthly princes by ſuch as enjoy their preſence, becauſe they cannot give audience to all their ſubjects, nor do they know the worthy; but <hi>God</hi> is <hi>omnipreſent,</hi> his <hi>ears always open,</hi> and his <hi>head bowed down</hi> to the <hi>prayers</hi> of his people; is no <hi>reſpecter</hi> of <hi>perſons,</hi> but gives a like <hi>acceſs</hi> to the <hi>beggar</hi> as to the <hi>prince,</hi> and promiſes to caſt out none that make their application to him; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of conſequence, that we ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs ourſelves <hi>immediately</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>aſk from him.</hi> If an <hi>earthly prince</hi> ſhould thus invite his ſubjects to petition him for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of their wants, I ſhould account the man no better than a <hi>fool</hi> or a <hi>madman,</hi> who would <hi>apply</hi> himſelf to any of the <hi>king's favourites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The concluſion is; O thou that heareſt prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> lxv. 2.) Since <hi>God,</hi> who is infinite in mercy, omnipreſent, and omnipotent in wiſdom and action, admits every man to the <hi>throne of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0028500202:113"/>grace,</hi> bids him aſk in the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and promiſes, whatever we aſk in his Son's name, he will do it.—Since the practice of <hi>praying to ſaints</hi> is <hi>injurious</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and doth manifeſtly <hi>rob</hi> him of his <hi>royal prerogative,</hi> which is to be the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>only mediator</hi> betwixt God and man; for in this <hi>office,</hi> he hath no <hi>ſharers</hi> or <hi>partners,</hi> according to the ſcripture account: As <hi>God</hi> is but <hi>one,</hi> and there is <hi>no other;</hi> ſo the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> (by the appointment of God) is but <hi>one,</hi> and there is, there can be <hi>no other</hi>

                     <hi>April</hi> 8, 1729, we leave the religious, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the journey.</note>§. 1. THE eighth of <hi>April,</hi> 1729, I bid the <hi>Ivonites</hi> adieu, and by their directions walked up a very ſteep and ſtony mountain, which took me two hours, and then arrived at what I had often ſeen before in this part of the world, a great lake, the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0028500202:116"/>water of which was black as ink to look at as it ſtood, though very bright in a cup, and muſt be owing, as I ſuppoſe, to its deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the abyſs: by the ſide of this water, under the ſhade of oak-trees, many hundred years old, we rid for an hour, on even ground, and then came to a deſcent ſo very dangerous and dark, through a wood on the mountain's ſide, that we could hardly creep it down on our feet, nor our horſes keep their legs as we led them to the bottom. This declivity was more than a mile, and ended in a narrow lane between a range of precipices that almoſt met at top. This paſs was knee-deep in water, from a ſpring in the bottom of the mountain we had come down, which ran through it, and ſo very ſtony, that it took us three hours to walk the horſes to the end of it, though it was not more than two miles: but at laſt we came to a fine plain, over which we rid for an hour and a half, and arrived at a wood, which ſeemed very large, and ſtood between two very high unpaſſable hills. In this foreſt was our way, and the road ſo dark, and obſtructed by the branches of trees, that it was diſmal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy to go. On however we went for a long time, and about the middle of it came to a circular opening of about four acres, in which four very narrow roads met; that we had travelled, another before us, and one on
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0028500202:117"/>each hand. The way ſtrait on we were cautioned by my friends not to go, as it was a terrible ride; but whether to turn to the right or left, we had forgot. I thought to the right; but my lad was poſitive, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered the directions was to take the left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand road. This cauſed a ſtop for ſome time, and as I was a little fatigued, I thought it beſt while we pauſed to dine. <hi>Finn</hi> brought immediately ſome meat, bread, and a bottle of cyder, from his valiſe, and under a great oak I ſat down, while our horſes fed on the green. One hour we reſted, and then went on again, to the left, as <hi>O Finn</hi> adviſed. For ſeveral hours we rid, or rather, our horſes walked, till we got out of the wood, and then arrived at the bottom of a ſteep moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; one ſide of which is in the northern extremity of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> and the other in the north end of <hi>Stanemore-Richmondſhire.</hi> This vaſt hill we aſcended, and came down the other ſide of the fell into a plain, which extends ſouth-eaſt for near half a mile to the river <hi>Teeſe,</hi> that divides the north end of <hi>Stanemore</hi> from Biſhoprick, or the county of <hi>Durham. Yorkſhire</hi> here ends in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe angle, between two mountains, and the angle, for a quarter of a mile, is filled with that beautiful tall ever-green tree, the broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaved <hi>alaternus,</hi> intermixed here and there in a charming manner, with the fir tree,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0028500202:118"/>the <hi>Norway</hi> ſpruce, and the balm of <hi>Gilead.</hi> It is as fine a grove as can in any part of the world be ſeen.</p>

Juſt at the entrance of it, by the ſide of a plentiful ſpring, which runs into the <hi>Teeſe,</hi> there ſtood the prettieſt little houſe I had ever beheld, and over it crept the pretty rock-roſe, the caſſine, the ſea-green coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla, and other ever-green ſhrubs.

I have not ſeen a ſweeter thing.

As there was no other fence to this fine ſpot of ground but a ditch like a <hi>ha</hi> to keep cattle out, I leaped into the gardens, and roamed about for ſome time, to look at the curious things. I then went up to the houſe, in hopes of ſeeing a human creature either high or low. I knocked at the door, but no one could I find, though the manſion did not look like an uninhabited place. I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0028500202:119"/>then ſauntered into the grove behind, and in a winding way of three hundred yards, that had been cut through the perennial wood, and was made between banks of ſpringing flowers, beautiful exotics, and various aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic ſhrubs, crept on till I arrived at a ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parlour, which ſtood in the middle of a circular acre of ground, and was ſurrounded and ſhaded with a beautiful grove; the larix, the phoenician cedar, and the upright ſavin. There was a little falling water near the door, that was pleaſing to look at, and charmed the ear. Entring this room, I found the walls painted by ſome maſterly hand, in baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of flowers, and the fineſt rural ſcenes. Two handſome couches were on either ſide the chamber, and between theſe <hi>lits de repos</hi> was as curious a table for wood and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip as could be ſeen. Pretty ſtools ſtood near it, and one arm-chair. It was a ſweet filent place, and in every reſpect, far beyond the ſleeping parlour in the gardens at <hi>Stow.</hi>

About an hour after my departure from him, he ſaw a poor man paſs over the plain, who had come down the mountain we deſcended, and was going to croſs the <hi>Teeſe</hi> in a ſmall ſkiff of his own, in order to go to his cottage on the other ſide in <hi>Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oprick:</hi> that he lived by fiſhing and fowling, and ſold what he got by land and water to the quality and gentlefolk, twenty miles round him. And on aſking who lived in the houſe before us, on the ſkirts of the grove, he ſaid, it belonged to a young lady of great fortune, Miſs <hi>Antonia Cranmer,</hi> whoſe father had been dead about a year, (died in the houſe I ſaw): that ſhe was the greateſt beauty in the world, and only nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and for one ſo young, wiſe to an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing degree: that ſhe lived moſtly at this ſeat, with her couſin, <hi>Agnes Vane,</hi> who was almoſt as handſome as ſhe: that Miſs <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> had no reliſh for the world, being uſed to ſtill life, and ſeldom ſtirred from home, but to viſit an old lady, her aunt, who lived in <hi>Cumberland:</hi> that ſhe was at preſent there,

               <p>The poor fiſherman gave me a bed very readily for money, as he had one to ſpare for a traveller, and he provided for me every thing I could deſire. He brought bread and ale from a village a few miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and I had plenty of fiſh and wild-fowl for my table.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0028500202:122"/>but the beauties in that time did not return. Still however I reſolved to wait; and, to amuſe myſelf till they came, went a little way off to ſee an extraordinary man.</p>

This was enough to excite my curioſity, and as ſoon as it was light, the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> I went to look for this ſolitary.

Variety and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs were every where to be ſeen.

                     <p>The writings of the apoſtles are allowed even by our adverſaries to be the oldeſt records of chriſtianity, and therefore to this antient and infallible rule we ought to appeal, to determine the controverſy between us and the <hi>papiſts,</hi> that is, to ſee how far this antiquity favours their doctrine and practices, or is in agreement with ours.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The proteſtants renounce the Pope, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one law-giver, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for theſe reaſons,—That the Pope is not mentioned in the New Teſtament; that Chriſt ſays, <hi>one is your maſter, even Chriſt;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>there is but one Lord, and one Faith: the whole family in heaven and earth is named of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Proteſtants do not pay any worſhip at all to ſaints and angels, but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs, conſider <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as their <hi>ſole mediator</hi> and <hi>advocate;</hi> for <hi>there is but one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They ſay, ſuch veneration and prayer to ſaints and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is ſuperſtition and will-worſhip, and only worſhip God with all their hearts and ſouls, with the moſt raiſed affections, and the highſt degrees of love and fear, faith and confidence; for it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> And the angel in the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſaid to <hi>John,</hi> who fell down
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0028500202:127"/>at his feet to worſhip him, <hi>See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow-ſervant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. We affirm the euchariſt is only a memorial of Chriſt's death; for Chriſt ſays, <hi>do this in remembrance of me;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from Chriſt himſelf, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 24) that they were to receive the elements with this view only: and in his epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> he tells us, that <hi>by one offering Chriſt hath for ever perfected thoſe who are ſanctified;</hi> and that becauſe there <hi>is remiſſion of ſins under the new covenant, there is no more offering for ſin;</hi> which proves; the euchariſt is not a propitiatory ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Proteſtants affirm, that the worſhip of God ought to be performed in a language which all men underſtand; and that they have a right to ſearch the ſcriptures: For, <hi>if I ſpeak with tongues;</hi> (ſays the <hi>apoſtle) in ſuch a language as thoſe I ſpeak to cannot underſtand, what ſhall I profit you? Let all things be done to edifying.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids us <hi>ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> And how could the word of Chriſt dwell richly in us in all wiſdom, teaching and admoniſhing one another in pſalms, hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, if we
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0028500202:128"/>had not the word of Chriſt, and the ſcriptures of truth to read and conſult for ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the proteſtant doctrines, and we ſee they were taught by Chriſt and by his apoſtles. We have the ſanction of the moſt venerable antiquity on our ſide, and this note of the true church of Chriſt belongeth to us in the higheſt perfection.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>papiſts</hi> then ſcornfully ſay, <hi>Where was your church</hi> before <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin?</hi> The anſwer is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: the doctrine of our church was in the <hi>writings</hi> of the <hi>inſpired apoſtles,</hi> where the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be found;—the ſame that was taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, whom they have forſaken, and whoſe faith they have corrupted. As to our <hi>predeceſſors</hi> and <hi>profeſſors,</hi> they were the <hi>perſecuted diſciples</hi> of the <hi>crucified Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> thoſe <hi>martyrs</hi> and <hi>confeſſors,</hi> whoſe blood the church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath cruelly ſpilt.

               <p>In ſhort, <hi>Dorick</hi> not only found, on a careful enquiry, that the <hi>ſyſtem</hi> of the <hi>church of Rome</hi> was <hi>error</hi> and <hi>turpitude, abomination, gain,</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi>—and her <hi>great deſign</hi> the <hi>very reverſe</hi> of the goſpel revelation, which came down from heaven to prepare men, by the practice of univerſal holineſs and virtue, for eternal life; but likewiſe, that even her <hi>Cardinal's notes</hi> prove, this church cannot be, in any ſenſe, the true church of Chriſt; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was perfectly infatuated to make choice of ſuch things for the marks of his church, as make it the very picture of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great.

This change in religion gave <hi>Dorick</hi> the higheſt ſatisfaction, (as he told me) and it was doubled by his being able to convert his beloved <hi>Adelaide</hi> from popery to the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But this joy had ſoon after ſome mitigation, by loſing one of the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able women in the world. Death robbed him of his heart's fond idol, and by that ſtroke he was ſo wounded, that he could not heal himſelf for a long time. He became the real <hi>mourner.</hi> He kept the reaſons of his anguiſh continually before him, and was more intent upon ſpending his ſpirits, than his ſorrows. He grew fond of ſolitude and ſilence, that he might indulge his paſſion, and provoke the emotion of that grief that was ready to devour him. In ſhort, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to the ſilent place I found him in, which was a part of his own eſtate, and turned <hi>hermit.</hi> He built the little villa I ſaw by the water-ſide, and formed the ground into the natural garden I beheld. <hi>Le Blanc</hi> mentions it in his letters, as an extraordinary thing, and very juſtly prefers it to the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and expenſive Gardens at <hi>Chiſwick,</hi> the work of the late Lord <hi>Burlington,</hi> Here <hi>Watſon</hi> laid in every thing he had a mind for, and filled his cloſet with books. He amuſed and kept himſelf healthy by working in his garden, and when he had done abroad, went in to read. His principal ſtudy was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0028500202:131"/>of the beſt learning, which is the true chriſtian; and from that he went to know what the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> have reſolved and taught. In ſome things, I found he was a learned agreeable man, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered greatly at his whim in turning hermit. I ſaid a great deal againſt it, as we ſat over a bottle of claret; told him he might employ his time and talents more uſefully in the world, by mixing and converſing with his fellow creatures, and by a mutual participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conveyance of the common bleſſings of nature and providence; and as he was not forty yet, adviſed him to go over the <hi>Teeſe,</hi> and make his addreſſes to Miſs <hi>Cranmer</hi> or Miſs <hi>Vane,</hi> both of them being moſt glorious girls, as I was told, and capable of adding greatly to the delights of philoſophy. You have not ſeen two finer creatures, ſoul and body, than they are, if I have been rightly informed; and I think, it would be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and more religious act to get one of them with child, in the ſtate of holy wedlock, than to write the beſt book that was ever printed. For my own part, I had rather marry, and double-rib one of theſe dear creatures, than die with the character of a father of the deſarts. But in vain did I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to this anchoret. Contemplation was become his <hi>Venus,</hi> from the hour he loſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0028500202:132"/>his <hi>Adelaide;</hi> and he had lived ſo very happy in his lone ſtate for ſeven years paſt, that he could not think of hazarding felicity by a change of life.

If at any time, and thing was wanting, <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> the fiſherman, who came to ſee him once or twice a week, very quickly got him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he required.

This is <hi>Olivet</hi>'s account of <hi>Bouhier;</hi> and I have heard ſome gentlemen who knew him ſay, that he was a very fine genius; but, they added, a popiſh bigot to the laſt degree, and therefore, <hi>Le Blanc</hi> choſe him as the fitteſt perſon of his acquaintance, to write an epiſtle to, that abuſed the reformation, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> divines. Great is the prejudice of education! When ſo bright a mind as <hi>Bouhier</hi>'s cannot ſee the <hi>deformity</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>reformation;</hi> but, on the contrary, with pleaſure reads the <hi>deſpicable defamation</hi> in <hi>Le Blanc</hi>'s letter.</p>

                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0028500202:135"/>
is this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the other doctors, who introduced the reformation into <hi>England,</hi> were downright <hi>enthuſiaſts,</hi> and compaſſed their deſigns by being ſeconded by thoſe, who were animated by a ſpirit of irreligion, and by a greedy deſire of ſeizing the poſſeſſions of the monks. It was the deſire of a change eſtabliſhed the reformation. The new doctors
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0028500202:136"/>ſeduced the people, and the people having miſtaken darkneſs for light, quitted the road of truth, to walk in the ways of error.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to morals, that this boaſted reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produced no change in that reſpect; for the people are not purer than they were in former times, and the eccleſiaſtics are deſpiſed and hated for the badneſs of their lives. The biſhops ſacrifice every thing to their ambition; and the clergy of the ſecond rank have no reſpect for their office. They ſpend the whole day in public places in ſmoaking and drinking, and are remarkable for drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo diſhonourable to eccleſiaſtics. Their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0028500202:137"/>talk is the moſt diſſolute, and the vice that degrades theſe profeſſors, ſets a bad example to ſober people, and makes them the jeſt of libertines.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The only remarkable change produced by the reformation was the marriage of prieſts; and, excluſive of this being againſt the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the catholic church, it is contrary to ſound policy and experience. The marriage of prieſts diminiſhes the reſpect we ſhould have for them. The miſconduct of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man makes the clergyman fall into contempt. The lewdneſs of the daughter makes the prieſt, her father, the object of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent jeſts; and for the moſt part, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the clergy turn whores after the death of their father; who, while living, ſpent more of his income in maintaining himſelf and children in pleaſure and luxury, than in works of charity. He lived profuſely, and dies poor.</p>
               <p>Beſide, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> clergy were the greateſt and moſt excellent men, yet a great man in the eyes of the world, loſes of the reſpect which is due to him, in proportion as he has any thing in common with the reſt of mankind. A <hi>Madam Newton,</hi> and a <hi>Madam Fontenelle,</hi> would injure the illuſtrious men whoſe name they bore. Nor is this all. Thoſe who by their diſpoſition cannot fix that ſecret
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0028500202:138"/>inclination, which induces us to love, on one perſon, are more humane and charitable than others. The unmarried eccleſiaſtics are more animated with that charitable ſpirit their function requires, as they have no worldly affections to divert it. People very rarely (as Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſays) employ themſelves in watering plants, when they want water them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. —In ſhort, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> divines are the worſt of men, and there is hardly any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in <hi>England.</hi>—Thus does this <hi>French</hi> Abbé revile the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reformation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. He miſrepreſents the whole nation, and with a falſhood and outrage peculiar to <hi>popery</hi> and <hi>maſs-prieſts,</hi> that is, to devils and the moſt execrable religion, ſcreams againſt the pure religion of the goſpel, and diſhoneſtly blackens ſome of the fineſt characters that ever adorned human nature. So very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent is this reverend <hi>French</hi> papiſt againſt the clergy of <hi>England,</hi> that he is even poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive there is not a divine in the nation knows how to behave like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the firſt article of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I obſerve, that it is ſo far from being true, that <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> divines, <hi>our reformers,</hi> were enthuſiaſts, and compaſſed their deſigns by the aſſiſtance of thoſe who were animated by a ſpirit of irreligion, and by a greedy deſire of ſeizing the poſſeſſion of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0028500202:139"/>the monks, (as this <hi>maſs-prieſt</hi> aſſerts); that it is moſt certain, on the contrary, <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the other <hi>reformers,</hi> were wiſe and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right chriſtians, who, from a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of religion, oppoſed the <hi>falſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> They ſaw that popery was contrary to the true genius of chriſtianity; its ſpirit inſolent and cruel; and its worſhip, not only a jumble of the moſt ridiculous fopperies and extravagancies, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from heathen cuſtoms and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but the impureſt that ever appeared in the world: that the <hi>deſigns</hi> of <hi>popiſh Rome</hi> were contrary to all the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> its <hi>doctrines abominable</hi> and <hi>ſinful;</hi> and its <hi>offices curſed</hi> and <hi>diabolical:</hi> it was evident, I ſay, to the conception of theſe great men, (I mean <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the other <hi>Engliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi>) that the <hi>Romiſh church</hi> was <hi>treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> and <hi>inhuman, blood-thirſty</hi> and <hi>antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;</hi> that her devotions were horrible and impious; her miniſters <hi>falſe prophets</hi> and <hi>liars,</hi> covered and decked with the livery of Chriſt, but in every thing acting contrary to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wrought by Jeſus; and therefore theſe wiſe and excellent <hi>reformers</hi> renounced <hi>popery,</hi> and bravely declared for that religion, which promotes the good of all mankind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires men to <hi>worſhip the Father only in ſpirit</hi> and <hi>in truth.</hi> They threw off the cloak and garments of antichriſt: they gloriouſly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0028500202:140"/>from him, and joined together in <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> to <hi>pleaſe the Lord Jehovah.</hi> There was no enthuſiaſm in the caſe, (as <hi>Le Blanc,</hi> the <hi>maſs-prieſt,</hi> has the front to ſay) but, when the light of the goſpel was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, and darkneſs had overſpread the earth; when ignorance and ſuperſtition uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally prevailed, and the <hi>immoralities</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were made to paſs for chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity in the world; then did theſe <hi>reformers</hi> call the people out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and preach to them the eſſential truths of the faith. They called them from an idolatrous religion, and all its train of direful effects; from that ſin of the firſt rank, which ſtrikes at the being of a God, and raviſhes from him the greateſt honour that is due to him from his creature, man; they called them from the horrible ſervice of the maſs, from their addreſſes to angels and ſaints, and their worſhip of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; to the inward knowledge of one true God, and the worſhip due to him only; to the ſanctification and honour, which is due to him above all things, and above every name; to the living hope in God through Chriſt; to regeneration, and inward renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith, hope, and charity; to a holy converſation, and a faithful performance of all the commandments; to true repentance, perſeverance to the end, and life eternal. To theſe <hi>truths,</hi> (not to be found in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0028500202:141"/>of our travelling <hi>maſs-prieſt</hi>) did the great, the glorious <hi>Engliſh</hi> reformers call mankind. They laboured to eſtabliſh them in every thing tending to a pure faith, and good life. In this, there is not, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>And as to their being aſſiſted by thoſe who were animated by a ſpirit of irreligion, and by a greedy deſire of ſeizing the poſſeſſions of the monks, it does not appear to be the truth of the caſe. Suppoſing there were ſuch irreligious men, the aſſiſtance the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> had from any great men in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's time, when the abbeys were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, was ſo very little, that malice only could mention it as an objection to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Popery, in that monarch's reign, was ſtill the eſtabliſhed religion of <hi>England,</hi> and both ſides blame this king's <hi>perſecutions.</hi> If <hi>papiſts</hi> were put to death for denying the <hi>ſupremacy</hi> of <hi>Harry, proteſtants</hi> were no leſs ſufferers, for oppoſing the adoration of the hoſt, and other religious impieties. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſhort reign of his ſon, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, what aſſiſtance had the <hi>reformers</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>bloody Mary?</hi> Did ſhe not do all that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal popery</hi> could ſuggeſt, to deſtroy <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> his brethren, and their reformation? And did not they, without any other aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than what they received from the ſpirit of God, continue to vindicate the <hi>truth as it is in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0028500202:142"/>Jeſus,</hi> and teach the pure doctrines of the goſpel, in oppoſition to the <hi>frauds</hi> and <hi>vile inventions</hi> of <hi>papal Rome.</hi> Without mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the indignities, the torments, and the cruel death prepared for them, the <hi>brave ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men</hi> went on with their heavenly work, and till, the flames made them ſilent, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to deſtroy the <hi>Romiſh artifices</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities,</hi> and to ſpread the <hi>pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father.</hi> They were zealous, with the truth of religion on their ſide, and laboured to convert, out of a pure and friendly regard to the eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of mankind. They did the work, by the bleſſing of God, and therefore the malicious <hi>Le Blanc,</hi> the <hi>maſs-prieſt,</hi> reviles and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them.</p>
               <p>What he ſays of <hi>uſurpation,</hi> in reſpect of church lands, does not deſerve any notice. The reforming clergy were not the actors in that ſcene. It was the king and his council. And as the Pope had ſhewed them the way, by granting <hi>bulls for the diſſolution of the leſſer monaſteries,</hi> they thought, ſince the Pope's power was taken away by a general conſent of the nation, the king, the church, and the people concurring, they might, with as little <hi>ſacrilege,</hi> diſſolve the reſt. The king and parliament (ſays Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>) could not diſcern the difference between greater and leſſer as to the point of <hi>ſacrilege.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0028500202:143"/>ſome uſes might ceaſe by the doctrines of the reformation, as maſſes for ſouls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and monks to pray the dead out of purgatory; yet there were others to employ the church lands about, as ſome of them were in founding <hi>new biſhopricks.</hi> And if in this caſe, the reformers had been guilty of ſome wilful errors, that could be no crime of the reformation. The culpable muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it. For the ſatisfaction of conſcience about the reformation, there can be but three queſtions fairly propoſed. Was there ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe for it? Was there ſufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? And whether the proceedings of our reformation were juſtifiable by the rule of ſcripture, and the ancient church? Upon theſe points we ought to join iſſue, and I am ſure the concluſion muſt be in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Le Blanc</hi>'s ſecond obſervation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>marriage of prieſts,</hi> which our <hi>reformation</hi> he ſays produced, it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the doctrine of a <hi>prieſt's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage being unlawful,</hi> was borrowed by the church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the antient heretics; eſpecially from the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who allowed marriage to their hearers, as the church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth to laymen; but forbad it to their <hi>elect,</hi> as that church doth to her <hi>prieſts.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> charges the <hi>Manichees</hi> wth this error. Hic non dubito vos eſſe clamaturos invidiam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0028500202:144"/>factures, caſtitatem perfectam vos vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter commendare atque laudare, non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men nuptias prohibere; quandoquidem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditores veſtri quorum apud vos ſecundus eſt gradus ducere atque habere non prohibentur uxores. <hi>De moribus manichaeorum, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>pope</hi> we read of that condemned the <hi>marriage</hi> of <hi>prieſts,</hi> was <hi>Syricius,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> A. D. 384—398. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I wonder <hi>Baronius</hi> had not a regard to his memory: but it has been the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of his <hi>holineſs</hi> ſince his death to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſpleaſure of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he has ſtruck him out of his cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſaints. He does not tell us for what reaſon. Perhaps it was becauſe this pope rather diſſuaded prieſts from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage than peremptorily forbad it, as appears by his letters. (Syr. epiſt. 1. &amp; 4. apud Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.)</p>
               <p>The next <hi>pope,</hi> who diſtinguiſhed himſelf againſt the <hi>marriage</hi> of <hi>prieſts,</hi> was the ſon of <hi>Bald-head,</hi> count of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> (whoſe grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter was conſort to <hi>Lewis</hi> the 6th, king of <hi>France</hi>); I mean the celebrated <hi>Guy,</hi> arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Vienne,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> A. D. 1119, and had for ſucceſſor in the year 1124, <hi>Lambert</hi> of <hi>Bononia,</hi> commonly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Honorius</hi> the ſecond. <hi>Calixtus</hi> the ſecond, pope and prince of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> was the firſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0028500202:145"/>who abſolutely forbad <hi>prieſts marriage,</hi> and in caſe they were married, commanded them to be ſeparated. (Grat. diſt. 27. c. 8.) This was in the beginning of the twelfth century. And towards the end of it, A. D. 1198, the renowned ſon of Count <hi>Traſimund,</hi> I mean <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, the ever memorable Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Lotharius,</hi> pronounced all the <hi>marriages</hi> of <hi>prieſts null.</hi> And afterwards came on the <hi>council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> A. D. 1545—1563, which anathematizes thoſe who ſay ſuch marriages are valid. (Seſſ. 24. can. 9.)</p>
               <p>But one would think, that God ſufficiently declared his approbation of ſuch marriages, in that the whole world hath by his appointment been twice peopled by two married prieſts; firſt by <hi>Adam,</hi> ſecondly by <hi>Noah.</hi> And we are ſure, the holy <hi>ſcripture</hi> tells us, <hi>That mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is honourable in all;</hi> (Heb. xiii. 4) and places it among the qualifications of a biſhop, <hi>That he be the huſband of one wife, having faithful children.</hi> (Tit. i. 6.) <hi>This,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, the apoſtle preſcribed to this end, that he might ſtop the mouths of hereticks, who reproached marriage; declaring thereby that marriage is no unclean thing, but ſo honourable, that a married man may be exalted to the ſacred throne of a biſhop.</hi> (Chryſoſt. hom. 2. in c. 1. ad tit.) What do you ſay to this, <hi>Le Blanc?</hi> I fancy you never read this <hi>homily</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0028500202:146"/>of <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> — And well might this ſaint think it not unbecoming a <hi>biſhop</hi> to <hi>marry,</hi> when our <hi>Lord</hi> thought it not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming</hi> an <hi>apoſtle,</hi> no not the prince of the apoſtles (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will have him), for it is without doubt, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was married; in that the ſcripture makes mention of his wife's mother. (<hi>Matt.</hi> viii. 14.) And <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> tells us, that it was certainly reported, that when he ſaw his wiſe led to death, he rejoiced; and having exhorted her and comforted her, he called her by her name, and bid her remember the Lord. (<hi>Clemens Alex. Stromat.</hi> l. 7. p. 736. lut. 1629.) And that he was not only mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but begat children, the ſame <hi>Clemens</hi> in another place affirms, (<hi>Stromat.</hi> l. 3. p. 448.) Yea that St. <hi>Philip</hi> and St. <hi>Jude</hi> were alſo married, and had children, <hi>Euſebius</hi> is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. (<hi>Euſeb.</hi> eccleſ. hiſt. l. 3. c. 20—31.) And in like manner we find, that many of the primitive biſhops were married. <hi>Chare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> biſhop of <hi>Nilus,</hi> St. <hi>Spiridion,</hi> St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> St. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,</hi> and many more, were married men.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be ſaid, that they took wives while they were laymen, and after they took upon them the ſacred miniſtry, were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them; ſince the <hi>canons,</hi> commonly called the apoſtles, did prohibit either biſhop, prieſt, or deacon, to put away his wife upon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0028500202:147"/>pretence of religion. (See canon 5.) And if any ſuch ſhall abſtain from marriage, as in itſelf abominable, command that he be corrected, or depoſed, and caſt out of the church. (Canon 50.)</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſing theſe <hi>canons</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that <hi>Whiſton</hi> has ſaid) were not made by them whoſe name they bear, yet they are allowed by all to be of much greater anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity than the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> council. And when in that council it was moved, that <hi>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>prieſts, deacons</hi> and <hi>ſub-deacons,</hi> might not cohabit with their wives, which they had taken before ordination, the <hi>motion</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently daſhed by the famous <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> who was himſelf a ſingle perſon. (<hi>Socrat.</hi> eccles. hiſt. l. 1. c. 11.) Yea a long time after this council, we meet with many <hi>popes,</hi> who were <hi>ſons</hi> of <hi>biſhops</hi> and <hi>prieſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Theodorus, Silverius,</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> I. were the ſons of biſhops: pope <hi>Boniface</hi> I. <hi>Felix</hi> II. and <hi>Agapetus</hi> II. were the ſons of prieſts. (<hi>Gratian.</hi> diſt. 56. c. 2.) and that we may not think this ſtrange, <hi>Gratian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf informs us, that the marriage of prieſts was in thoſe days lawful in the Latin church. (Diſt. 56. c. 12.)</p>
               <p>Nor is this doctrine to be rejected only as contrary to ſcripture, and to primitive and apoſtolical practice, but becauſe of the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable fruits produced in the church of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0028500202:148"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> by it. For when the clergy might not have wives, (which God allowed), inſtead of them they took whores; and that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo far prevailed in the church, that the Cardinal of <hi>Cambray</hi> informs us, (De reform. eccleſ.) many clergymen were not aſhamed publickly, in the face of the world, to keep concubines. And the gloſs upon <hi>Gratian</hi> ſays, A prieſt may not be depoſed for ſimple fornication, becauſe there are few prieſts to be found without that fault. This made <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond ſay, that though prieſts were by the weſtern church forbid to marry for good reaſon, yet there was ſtronger reaſon to reſtore marriage to them again. (Hiſt. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Trent. l. 7. p. 680.) And many in that council, were ſo ſenſible of this, that they alledged the great ſcandal given by inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent prieſts, and that there was want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent perſons fit to exerciſe the miniſtry. (<hi>Paoli,</hi> p. 679. &amp;c.) The Emperor and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> did therefore require, that the marriage of prieſts might be granted. (<hi>Paoli,</hi> p. 680. &amp;c.) And many biſhops deſired that married perſons might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to holy orders; but this requeſt was not granted, becauſe, as the fathers obſerved, if the clergy once come to be married, they will no longer depend on the Pope, but on their prince.</p>

To conclude this article, (and I ſhall do it in the words of a great man, a prelate of the church of <hi>England,</hi> now living); To make war againſt the very Being of their ſpecies, they, (the <hi>Romiſh prieſts</hi>) devote themſelves to a ſingle life, in blaſphemous oppoſition to that firſt great command and bleſſing, <hi>increaſe and multiply.</hi>

               <p>As to <hi>Le Blanc</hi>'s third obſervation, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the immoralities and bad behaviour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> clergy; I anſwer, if there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral bad men among ſo large a body as the proteſtant divines are, which is not ſtrange, as it is the common caſe of all ſocieties, yet the majority of them, orthodox and other dox, are as worthy men as can be found among the human race. I am very ſure my acquaintance among them has been much larger than <hi>Le Blanc</hi>'s could poſſibly be; and I can affirm from my own knowledge, that there are very many of this order of men, not only as fine gentlemen as I have ever converſed with; but, a clergy holy in heart; ſuperior to pride, to anger, to fooliſh deſires; who walk as <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo walked, and by their <hi>example</hi> and <hi>doctrine,</hi> labour to make the people what the <hi>goſpel</hi> requires they ſhould be; that is, pious and uſeful, pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, meek and charitable; to walk by faith, and not by ſight; and ſo paſs through things temporal, that they may be ſure of obtaining
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0028500202:150"/>the things eternal. This I can ſay of many <hi>Engliſh</hi> divines of my acquaintance: and I may add, that this teſtimony from me, who am not over-fond of the clergy, (as the main of the chriſtianity of too many of them lies in their opinion; decked with a few outward obſervances, ſays Mr. <hi>Weſley</hi> very truly, in his letter to Biſhop <hi>Warburton</hi>) and only upon occaſion, endeavour now to do them juſtice, is certainly of more weight in their favour, than the calumny and abuſe of a <hi>furious bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got</hi> and maſs-prieſt, can be to make the world have as bad an opinion of them, as <hi>popery,</hi> and its wretched emiſſaries, would have the public entertain. Conſider this then when you read <hi>Le Blanc</hi>'s letters.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, I have had a very large and intimate acquaintance with <hi>maſs-prieſts</hi> in my time, in many parts of the world; and, a few excellent ones excepted, I can affirm, that more wicked and more worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs men than theſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> monks, I have never ſeen. If adultery, fornication, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, and ſwearing, are crimes, then the greateſt criminals I could name in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, are <hi>Roman-catholic</hi> prieſts. Let this aſſertion of mine be ſet over-againſt the character the <hi>Ahbé Le Blanc</hi> gives the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> proteſtant miniſters.

What a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then muſt I be in, when a heaven-born maid, like her, appeared! Strange pleaſures filled my ſoul, unlooſed my tongue,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0028500202:153"/>and my firſt talk could not be any thing but love. A deal I ſaid on the ſubject, not worth repeating to the reader; and the iſſue of the matter was, that I became ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this <hi>innocent beauty,</hi> that, on tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my leave, I had an invitation to breakfaſt with her the next morning. I was there by eight, and really and truly quite charmed with her. She was pretty as it was poſſible for fleſh and blood to be, had a beautiful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and as ſhe had very little notion of men, having ſeen very few, except the two old ſervants who lived with her, ſhe had not a notion of any danger that could come from converſing freely with a man ſhe knew nothing of, and who might be an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in diſguiſe.</p>
               <p>After breakfaſt, I offered to go, but ſhe aſked me to ſtay and dine; and to ſum up the matter, I did dine, ſup, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with her every day, for a month, till my good prieſt, <hi>Friar Fleming,</hi> arrived, on a letter I had ſent him, and we were married before the end of ſix weeks. We loved to exceſs, and did enhance human happineſs to a high degree. She was good as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; and for two years we lived in unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able felicity. For the greateſt part of that time, we were at <hi>Orton-Lodge,</hi> as ſhe liked the wild place. There ſhe likewiſe died of the ſmall-pox, in the firſt month of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0028500202:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>third year, and left me the moſt diſconſolate of men. Four days I ſat with my eyes ſhut, on account of this loſs, and then left the <hi>Lodge</hi> once more, to live if I could, ſince my religion ordered me ſo to do, and ſee what I was next to meet with in the world. As grief ſat powerfully on my ſpirits, and if not diſlodged, would have drank them all up very ſoon, I reſolved to haſten to <hi>Harrogate,</hi> and in the feſtivities of that place forget my departed partner as ſoon as I could. I laid my <hi>Antonia</hi> by my <hi>Charlotte</hi> and my <hi>Statia,</hi> and then rode off. What happened at the <hi>Wells,</hi> and all the obſervations I made there, and thereabout, the reader will find in my fifth ſection.</p>
               <p>N. B. As I mention nothing of any chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by ſo many wives, ſome readers may perhaps wonder at this, and therefore, to give a general anſwer, once for all, I think it ſufficient to obſerve, that I had a great many, to carry on the <hi>ſucceſſion;</hi> but as they never were concerned in any extraordinary affairs, nor ever did any remarkable things, that I heard of; — only riſe and breakfaſt, read and ſaunter, drink and eat, it would not be fair, in my opinion, to make any one pay for their hiſtory.</p>

They riſe out of a little dry hill. The ſecond is a yard from the firſt, and the third is five yards and a half from the ſecond. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riſes into ſtone-baſons, which are each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in a ſmall neat building of ſtone and lime a yard ſquare on the inſides, and two yards high, covered over with thick flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones laid ſhelving.</p>
               <p>The ſoil out of which theſe ſprings riſe is, firſt, corn-mould, then a marle lime-ſtone, and a ſtratum of plaiſter: the lime-ſtone is ſo abraded by the ſalt in the water, that when dried, it ſwims: and where the water ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates between the baſons and the brook, the earth is ink black, and has a dry white ſcum, which ſmells like ſulphur, and burns with a blue flame. The water does likewiſe throw up much candied ſea ſalts, that is, ſalts to which ſulphur adheres, and the pigeons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort from all parts to pick them up. In moiſt or rainy weather, theſe waters ſend forth a ſtrong ſmell at a diſtance, and before rain, they bubble up with an impetuous force; yet neither rain nor drought increaſes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the ſprings.</p>

From the large quantities of fine flower of brimſtone which theſe waters throw off, it is plain, that ſulphur is the principal thing in them; but experiment likewiſe proves, that beſides ſulphur, the ſtinking well has vitriol, nitre, copper, and ſalt: Theſe lie <hi>in ſolutis principiis</hi> in earth from which the water comes, and may be ſeparated by operation: ſome, I know, deny there is any copper in theſe waters; but they do not conſider that the glittering glebes of a gold colour found here, can be nothing elſe than glebes gilt with copper.</p>
               <p>As to the diſeaſes wherein this ſtrong <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur-water</hi> is proper, it is good for every thing, except a conſumption. For this I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the <hi>Scarborough purging-chalybeate</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all waters. But if, reader, you have obſtructions in your liver and other viſcera, and are tormented with vicious humours in your inteſtines; if your bowels are full of worms, the aſcarides, or the broad round worm, or the worms called the dog and the wolf, from their likeneſs to theſe animals; or if, from a venereal cauſe, (the malady of many a prieſt and layman) you have an ulcer in the <hi>anus,</hi> or in the neck of your bladder, go to <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate;</hi> drink the ſtinking-water, live tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and you will be cured. For the ſcurvy, that univerſal diſeaſe, it is better than all other medicines. It is excellent in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0028500202:158"/>jaundice, though of many years ſtanding. It cures the aſthma, the ſcotomia, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and in many other deplorable caſes gives wonderful relief. Whatever ails you, (the conſumption excepted) fly to <hi>Harrogate,</hi> and the water will do you good, if your hour be not come: and if you are well, the waters will promote long life, and make you the more able to dance with the ladies.</p>
               <p>Four pints of water are enough for a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, to be taken from half an hour to two hours after ſun -riſing, upon an empty ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. You ſhould take ſome preparatory medicine; and walk drinking the waters to warm the body a little, and make the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage the eaſier. Some people I have known drink their doſe in bed, and it does well enough: but exerciſe and the thin open air do better, and contribute not a little to the patient's recovery: and there is no finer freſher air in <hi>England</hi> than at this place.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, theſe wells are the ſtrongeſt ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur-water in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and, from the ſuperior ſtrength of the impregnating ſulphur, it does not loſe but retain the ſulphureous ſmell, even when expoſed to a ſcalding, and almoſt a violent heat; and, in diſtilling it, when three pints had been taken off from a gallon of it, the laſt was as ſtrong as the firſt, and ſtunk intolerably.</p>

Make haſte then to <hi>Harrogate,</hi> if you are ſick, and have money, and in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity you will find the waters efficacious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thy diſtemper be a <hi>conſumption,</hi> or in its nature incurable, which is the caſe of many, as death is the common fate of mankind.</p>

                  </note>§. 3. As to the company at theſe wells, I found it very good, and was pleaſed with the manner of living there. In the day-time we drank the waters, walked or rid about, and lived in ſeparate parties; lodging in one
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0028500202:162"/>or other of the three inns that are on the edge of the common: but at night, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany meet at one of the <hi>public-houſes,</hi> (the <hi>inns</hi> having the benefit of the meeting in their turn), and ſup together between eight and nine o'clock on the beſt ſubſtantial things, ſuch as hot ſhoulders of mutton, rump-ſtakes, hot pigeon pies, veal-cutlets, and the like. For this ſupper, ladies and gentlemen pay eight-pence each, and after ſitting an hour, and drinking what wine, punch, and ale, every one chuſes, all who pleaſe get up to country-dances, which generally laſt till one in the morning; thoſe that dance, and thoſe who do not, drinking as they will. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies pay nothing for what liquor is brought in, either at ſupper or after, and it coſts the gentlemen five or ſix ſhillings a man. At one the ladies withdraw, ſome to their houſes in the neighbourhood, and ſome to their beds in the inns. The men who are temperate, do then likewiſe go to reſt.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, of all the wells I know, <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate</hi> is in my opinion the moſt charming. The waters are incomparable, no air can be better: and with the greateſt civility, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and good humour, there is a certain rural plainneſs and freedom mixed, which are vaſtly pleaſing. The lady of pleaſure, the well-dreſt taylor, and the gameſter, are not to be found there. Gentlemen of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0028500202:163"/>country, and women of birth and fortune, their wives, ſiſters, and daughters, are for the moſt part the company. There were at leaſt fourſcore ladies in the country-dances every night, while I was there, and among them many fine women.</p>

                  </note>§. 4. Among the company I found at this agreeable place, were ſix <hi>Iriſh</hi> gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had been my contemporaries in Trinity-College, <hi>Dublin,</hi> and were right glad to ſee me, as we had been <hi>Sociorums,</hi> (a word of <hi>Swift</hi>'s) at the conniving-houſe at <hi>Rings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi> for many a ſummer's evening, and their regard for me was great. They thought I had been long numbered with the dead, as they could not get any account of me for ſo many years; and when they ſaw me, at their entring the public room, ſitting by a beauty, in deep diſcourſe, God-zounds, (ſays one of them,) there he is, making love to the fineſt woman in the world. Theſe gentlemen were Mr. <hi>Gollogher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallaſpy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dunkley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Makins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and Mr. <hi>O'Keefe,</hi> deſcended from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> kings, and firſt couſin to the great <hi>O'Keefe,</hi> who was buried not long ago in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby. They were all men of large fortunes, and, Mr. <hi>Makins</hi> excepted, were as handſome, fine fellows as could be picked out in all the world. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> was a very low, thin man, not four feet
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0028500202:164"/>high, and had but one eye, with which he ſquinted moſt ſhockingly. He wore his own hair, which was ſhort and bad, and only dreſt by his combing it himſelf in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without oyl or powder. But as he was matchleſs on the fiddle, ſung well, and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed agreeably, he was a favourite with the ladies. They preferred ugly <hi>Makins</hi> (as he was called) to many very handſome men. I will here give the public the character of theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> gentlemen, for the honour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and as they were curioſities of the human kind.</p>

He had read and thought, travelled and converſed, was a man of ſenſe, and a ſcholar. He had a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſoul, which ſhewed a pre-eminence of dignity, and by conduct and behaviour, the faithful interpreters of the heart, always atteſted the nobleſt and moſt generous ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He had an extreme abhorrence of meanneſs of all kinds, treachery, revenge, envy, littleneſs of mind, and ſhewed in all his actions the qualities that adorn a man.— His learning was of the genteel and uſeful kind; a ſort of agreeable knowledge, which he acquired rather from a ſound taſte and good judgment than from the books he had read. He had a right eſtimation of things, and had gathered up almoſt every thing that is amuſing or inſtructive. This rendered
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0028500202:165"/>him a maſter in the art of pleaſing: and as he had added to theſe improvements the faſhionable ornaments of life, languages and bodily exerciſes, he was the delight of all that knew him.</p>

                  <hi>Makins</hi> was poſſeſſed of all the excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and perfections that are within the reach of human abilities. He had received from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the happieſt talents, and he made ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar improvements of them by a ſucceſsful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the moſt uſeful and moſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſtudies. Muſic, as before obſerved, he excelled in. His intellectual faculties were fine, and, to his honour I can affirm, that he moſtly employed them, as he did his great eſtate, to the good of mankind, the advancement of morality, and the ſpread of <hi>pure theiſm,</hi> the worſhip of God <hi>our Saviour,</hi> who raiſed and ſent Chriſt to be a Redeemer. This gentleman was a zealous <hi>Unitarian,</hi> and, though but five and twenty, (when we met at <hi>Harrogate</hi>) a religious man: but his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was without any melancholy; nor had it any thing of that ſeverity of temper, which diffuſes too often into the hearts of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a moroſe contempt of the world, and an antipathy to the pleaſures of it. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the aſſemblies of fools, knaves, and blockheads, but was fond of good company, and condemned that doctrine which taught men to retire from human ſociety to ſeek
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0028500202:166"/>God in the horrors of ſolitude. He thought the Almighty may be beſt found among men, where his goodneſs is moſt active, and his providence moſt employed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Character of Mr. <hi>Gallaſpy.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Gallaſpy</hi> was the talleſt and ſtrongeſt man I have ever ſeen, well made, and very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. He had wit and abilities, ſung well, and talked with great ſweetneſs and fluency, but was ſo extremely wicked, that it were better for him, if he had been a natural fool. By his vaſt ſtrength and activity, his riches and eloquence, few things could withſtand him. He was the moſt prophane ſwearer I have known: fought every thing, whored every thing, and drank ſeven in a hand; that is, ſeven glaſſes ſo placed between the fingers of his right hand, that in drinking, the liquor fell into the next glaſſes, and thereby he drank out of the firſt glaſs ſeven glaſſes at once. This was a common thing, I find from a book in my poſſeſſion, in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, in the madneſs that followed the reſtoration of that profligate and worthleſs prince. But this gentleman was the only man I ever ſaw who could or would attempt to do it; and he made but one gulp of whatever he drank; he did not ſwallow a fluid like other people, but if it was a quart, poured it in as from pitcher to pitcher. When he ſmoaked tobacco, he always blew two pipes at once, one at each corner of his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0028500202:167"/>mouth, and threw the ſmoak of both out of his noſtrils. He had killed two men in duels before I left <hi>Ireland,</hi> and would have been hanged, but that it was his good fortune to be tried before a Judge, who never let any man ſuffer for killing another in this manner. (This was the late Sir <hi>John St. Leger.</hi>) He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched all the women he could, and many whom he could not corrupt, he raviſhed. I went with him once in the ſtage-coach to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and ſeeing two pretty ladies paſs by in their own chariot, he ſwore in his horrible way, having drank very hard after dinner, that he would immediately ſtop them, and raviſh them: nor was it without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that I hindered him from attempting the thing; by aſſuring him I would be their <hi>protector,</hi> and he muſt paſs through my heart before he could proceed to offer them the leaſt rudeneſs. In ſum, I never ſaw his equal in impiety, eſpecially when inflamed with liquor, as he was every day of his life, though it was not in the power of wine to make him drunk, weak, or ſenſeleſs. He ſet no bounds or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions to mirth and revels. He only ſlept every third night, and that often in his cloaths in a chair, where he would ſweat ſo prodigiouſly as to be wet quite through; as wet as if come from a pond, or a pail of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been thrown on him. While all the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0028500202:168"/>world was at reſt, he was either drinking or dancing, ſcouring the bawdy-houſes, or riding as hard as he could drive his horſe on ſome iniquitous project. And yet, he never was ſick, nor did he ever receive any hurt or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. In health, joy, and plenty, he paſſed life away, and died about a year ago at his houſe in the county of <hi>Galway,</hi> without a pang or any kind of pain. This was <hi>Jack Gallaſpy.</hi> There are however ſome things to be ſaid in his favour, and as he had more regard for me than any of his acquaintance, I ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful if I did not do him all the juſtice in my power.</p>
               <p>He was in the firſt place far from being quarrelſome, and if he fought a gentleman at the ſmall-ſword, or boxed with a porter or coachman, it was becauſe he had in ſome degree been ill uſed, or fancied that the laws of honour required him to call an equal to an account, for a tranſaction. His temper was naturally ſweet.</p>
               <p>In the next place, he was the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of mankind. His purſe of gold was ever at his friend's ſervice: he was kind and good to his tenants: to the poor a very great benefactor. He would give more money away to the ſick and diſtreſſed in one year, than I believe many rich pious people do in ſeven. He had the bleſſings of thouſands,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0028500202:169"/>for his charities, and, perhaps, this procured him the protection of heaven.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>ſwearing,</hi> he thought it was only criminal, when it was falſe, or men lyed in their affirmations: and for <hi>whoring,</hi> he hoped there would be mercy, ſince men will be men while there are women. <hi>Raviſhing</hi> he did not pretend to juſtify, as the laws of his country were againſt it; but he could not think the woman was a ſufferer by it, as ſhe enjoyed without ſinning the higheſt felicity. He intended her happineſs; and her ſaying <hi>No,</hi> kept her an <hi>innocent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far all this can excuſe Mr. <hi>Gallaſpy,</hi> I pretend not to determine: but as I thought it proper to give the world the picture of ſo extraordinary a man, it was incumbent on me, as his friend, to ſay all I could, with truth, in his vindication.</p>

He was one of the men that are capable of touching every note. To all the variety of topics for converſation, the diverſity of occurrences and incidents, the ſeveral diſtinctions of perſons, he could adapt himſelf. He would laugh like <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus:</hi>

He was qualified to pleaſe all taſtes, and capable of acting every part. He was grave, gay, a philoſopher, and a trifler.

                  <hi>Monaghan</hi> had genius and knowledge, had read many books, but knew more of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. He laughed at the men who loſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their books the elegancy of mind ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in civil ſociety. He had no reliſh but for nice ſtudies and fine literature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed too ſerious and abſtruſe ſciences. This was reckoned a fault in him by ſeveral judges: but with me it is a quere, if he was much to blame. Politeneſs is certainly preferable to dry knowledge and thorny enquiries. This gentleman's was ſuch as rendered him for ever agreeable and engaging. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually an improving friend, and a gay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.

                  <hi>Gollogher</hi> was a man of learning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary abilities. He had read very hard for ſeveral years, and during that time, had collected and extracted from the beſt books more than any man I ever was acquainted with. He had four vaſt volumes of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, royal paper, bound in rough calf, and had filled them with what is moſt curious and beautiful in works of literature, moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in eloquent diſcourſes, moſt poignant in books of criticiſm, moſt inſtructive in hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, moſt touching and affecting in news, cataſtrophes, and ſtories; and with apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms, ſayings, and epigrams. A prodigious memory made all this his own, and a great judgment enabled him to reduce every thing to the moſt exact point of truth and accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. A rare man! Till he was five and twenty, he continued this ſtudious life, and but ſeldom went into the mixed and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able circles of the world. Then, all at once, he ſold every book he had, and determined to read no more. He ſpent his every day in the beſt company of every kind; and as he had the happy talent of manner, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

He charmed wherever he came. The ſpecific I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned made every one fond of him. With the ladies eſpecially he was a great favourite, and more fortunate in his amours than any man I knew. Had he wanted the fine ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents he was bleſt with, yet his being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely handſome man, and a maſter on the fiddle, could not but recommend him to the ſex. He might, if he had pleaſed, have married any one of the moſt illuſtrious and richeſt women in the kingdom. But he had an averſion to matrimony, and could not bear the thought of a wife. Love and a bottle were his taſte. He was however the moſt honourable of men in his amours, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abandoned any woman to diſtreſs, as too many men of fortune do, when they have gratified deſire. All the diſtreſſed were ever ſharers in Mr. <hi>Gollogher</hi>'s fine eſtate, and eſpecially the girls he had taken to his breaſt. He provided happily for them all, and left
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0028500202:173"/>nineteen daughters he had by ſeveral women a thouſand pounds each. This was acting with a temper worthy of a man; and to the memory of the <hi>benevolent Tom Gollogher</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote this memorandum.</p>

                  </note>§. 6. As I travelled once in the county of <hi>Kildare</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the ſummer-time, I came into a land of flowers and bloſſoms, hills, woods, and ſhades: I ſaw upon an eminence a houſe, ſurrounded with the moſt agreeable images of rural beauties, and which appeared to be on purpoſe placed in that deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſpot for retirement and contemplation. It is in ſuch ſilent receſſes of life, that we can beſt enjoy the <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>felicitous</hi> ideas, which more immediately concern the attention of man, and in the <hi>cool hours</hi> of reflection, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted from the fancies and follies, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the faction, and the pleaſures of an engaged world, thoroughly conſider the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and harmony of the works of nature, the important purpoſes of providence, and the various reaſons we have to adore that ever glorious <hi>Being,</hi> who formed us for rational

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Miſs <hi>Hunt.</hi>
                  </note>The owner of this ſweet place was Mr. <hi>Charles Hunt,</hi> a gentleman of a ſmall eſtate and good ſenſe, whom I knew many years before fortune led me to his houſe. His wife was then dead, and he had but one child left, his daughter <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The beauties of this young lady were very extraordinary. She had the fineſt eyes in the world, and ſhe looked, ſhe ſmiled, ſhe talked with ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive charms, as were ſufficient to fire the heart of the moroſeſt woman-hater that ever lived, and give his ſoul a ſoftneſs it never felt before. Her father took all poſſible pains to educate her mind, and had the ſucceſs to render her underſtanding a wonder, when ſhe was but twenty years old. She ſung likewiſe beyond moſt women, danced to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and had every accompliſhment of ſoul and body that a man of the beſt taſte could wiſh for in a wife or a miſtreſs. She was all beauty, life, and ſoftneſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> thought to have had great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this daughter, though it was not in his power to give her more than five hundred pounds for a fortune, and ſhe would have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0028500202:175"/>been married to a country-gentleman in his neighbourhood of a good eſtate, had not death carried off both her father and lover in a few days, juſt as the match was agreed on. This was a ſad misfortune, and opened a door to a long train of ſorrows. For two years however after the deceaſe of her father, ſhe lived very happily with an old lady, her near relation, and was univerſally admired and reſpected. I ſaw her many times du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that term, at the old lady's villa within a few miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and took great delight in her company. If I had not been then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to another, I would moſt certainly have married her.</p>
               <p>In this way I left <hi>Eliza</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for ſeveral years could not hear what was become of her. No one could give me any information: but, about a twelvemonth ago, as I was walking in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> I ſaw a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who cleaned ſhoes, and ſeemed to be an object of great diſtreſs. She was in rags and dirt beyond all I had ever ſeen of the profeſſion, and was truly ſkin and bone. Her face was almoſt a ſcull, and the only remaining expreſſion to be ſeen was deſpair and anguiſh. The object engaged my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, not only on account of the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſery that was viſible; but, as her eyes, though ſunk, were ſtill extraordinary, and there were ſome remains of beauty to be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0028500202:176"/>traced. I thought I had ſomewhere ſeen that face in better condition. This kept me look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her, unnoticed, for near a quarter of an hour; and as I found ſhe turned her head from me, when ſhe ſaw me, with a kind of conſciouſneſs, as if ſhe knew me, I then aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her name, and if ſhe had any where ſeen me before? — The tears immediately ran plentifully from her eyes, and when ſhe could ſpeak, ſhe ſaid, I am <hi>Elizabeth Hunt.</hi> —What, Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s daughter of <hi>Rafar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin!</hi> I replied with amazement, and a concern that brought the tears into my eyes. I called a coach immediately, and took her to the houſe of a good woman, who lodges and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſick people: ordered her clean cloaths, and gave the woman a charge to take the greateſt care of her, and let her want for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proper, till I called next day.</p>
               <p>When I ſaw her again, ſhe was clean and whole, and ſeemed to have recovered a little, though very little, of what ſhe once was: but a more miſerable ſpectacle my eyes have not often ſeen. She told me, that ſoon after I went to <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>R.</hi> a gentleman of my acquaintance of great fortune, got acquainted with her, courted her, and ſwore in the moſt ſolemn manner, by the ſupreme power, and the everlaſting goſpel, that he would be her huſband, and marry her as ſoon as a rich dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncle had breathed his laſt, if ſhe would
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0028500202:177"/>conſent, in the mean while, to their living in ſecret as man and wife; for his uncle hated matrimony, and would not leave him his vaſt fortune, if he heard he had a wife; and he was ſure, if he was married by any of the church, ſome whiſperer would find it out, and bring it to his ear. But notwithſtanding this plauſible ſtory, and that he acted the part of the fondeſt and tendereſt man that ever lived, yet, for ſeveral months, ſhe would not comply with his propoſal. She refuſed to ſee him any more, and for ſeveral weeks he did not come in her ſight.</p>
               <p>The fatal night however at laſt arrived, and from the Lord Mayor's ball, he prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her, by repeated vows of ſincerity and truth, to come with him to his lodgings. She was undone, with child, and at the end of two months, ſhe never ſaw him more. When her relations ſaw her big belly, they turned her out of doors; her friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance would not look at her, and ſhe was ſo deſpiſed, and aſhamed to be ſeen, that ſhe went to <hi>England</hi> with her little one. It fortunately died on the road to <hi>London,</hi> and as her five hundred pounds were going faſt by the time ſhe had been a year in the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſhe accepted an offer made her by a great man to go into keeping. Three years ſhe lived with him in ſplendor, and when he died, ſhe was with ſeveral in high life, 'till
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0028500202:178"/>ſhe got a cancer in her breaſt; and after it was cut off, an incurable abſceſs appeared. This ſtruck her out of ſociety, and as ſhe grew worſe and worſe every day, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhe had, and cloaths, were all gone in four years time, in the relief ſhe wanted and in ſupport. She came the fifth year to a garret and rags, and at laſt, to clean ſhoes, or periſh for want. She then uncovered the upper part of her body, which was half eaten away, ſo as to ſee into the trunk, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her, in the emaciated condition ſhe was in, an object ſhocking to behold. She lived in torment, and had no kind of eaſe or peace, but in reflecting, that her miſery and diſtreſs might procure her the mercy of heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and in conjunction with her true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance bring her to reſt, when ſhe had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the grave and gate of death.</p>
               <p>Such was the caſe of that <hi>Venus</hi> of her ſex, Miſs <hi>Hunt.</hi>—When firſt I ſaw her, it was rapture to be in her company: her perſon matchleſs, and her converſation as charming as her perſon: both eaſy, unconſtrained, and beautiful to perfection.—When laſt I ſaw her, ſhe was grim as the ſkeleton, horrid, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and ſinking faſt into the grave by the laws of corruption. What a change was there! She lived but three months from the time I put her into a lodging, and died as <hi>happy a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> as ſhe had lived an <hi>unhappy woman.</hi> I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0028500202:179"/>gave her a decent private funeral; a <hi>hearſe,</hi> and one <hi>mourning-coach,</hi> in which I alone at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her <hi>remains</hi> to the <hi>earth;</hi> the great <hi>charnel-houſe,</hi> where all the <hi>human race</hi> muſt be <hi>depoſited.</hi> Here ends the ſtory of Miſs <hi>Hunt.</hi>

But to return to <hi>Harrogate.</hi> While I was there, it was my fortune to dance with a lady, who had the head of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> of a <hi>primitive chriſtian,</hi> and the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Venus de medicis.</hi> This was Miſs <hi>Spence,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">An apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for the author's marrying ſo often.</note>To this I reply, that I think it unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and impious to grieve immoderately for the dead. A decent and proper tribute of tears and ſorrow, humanity requires; but when that duty has been payed, we muſt remember, that to lament a dead woman is not to lament a wife. A wife muſt be a living woman. The wife we loſe by death is no more than a ſad and empty object, formed by the imagination, and to be ſtill devoted to her, is to be in love with an idea. It is a mere chimerical paſſion, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed has no more to do with this world, than if ſhe had exiſted before the flood. As
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0028500202:181"/>we cannot reſtore what nature has deſtroyed, it is fooliſh to be faithful to affliction.—Nor is this all. If the woman we marry has the ſeven qualifications which every man would wiſh to find in a wife, beauty, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, ſweetneſs of temper, a ſprightly wit, fertility, wealth, and noble extraction, yet death's ſnatching ſo amiable a wife from our arms can be no reaſon for accuſing fate of cruelty, that is, providence of injuſtice; nor can it authoriſe us to ſink into inſenſibility, and neglect the duty and buſineſs of life. This wife was born to die, and we receive her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condition of mortality. She is lent but for a term, the limits of which we are not made acquainted with; and when this term is expired, there can be no injuſtice in taking her back: nor are we to indulge the tranſports of grief to diſtraction, but ſhould look out for another with the ſeven qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as it is not good for man to be alone, and as he is by the <hi>Abrahamic</hi> covenant bound to carry on the <hi>ſucceſſion,</hi> in a regular way, if it be in his power.—Nor is this all; if the woman adorned with every natural and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired excellence is tranſlated from this gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my planet to ſome better world, to be a ſharer of the <hi>divine favour,</hi> in that peaceful and happy ſtate which God hath prepared for the <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>faithful,</hi> muſt it not be ſenſeleſs
<pb n="165-166" facs="tcp:0028500202:182"/>for me to indulge melancholy and continue a mourner on her account, while ſhe is breathing the balmy air of paradiſe, enjoying pure and radiant viſion, and beyond deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happy?</p>
               <p>In the next place, as I had forfeited my father's favour and eſtate, for the ſake of <hi>chriſtian-deiſm,</hi> and had nothing but my own honeſt induſtry to ſecure me daily bread, it was neceſſary for me to lay hold of every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to improve my fortune, and of conſequence do my beſt to gain the heart of the firſt rich young woman who came in my way, after I had buried a wife. It was not fit for me to ſit ſnivelling for months, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my wife died before me, which was, at leaſt, as probable, as that ſhe ſhould be the ſurvivor; but inſtead of ſolemn affliction, and the inconſolable part, for an event I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, it was incumbent on me, after a little decent mourning, to conſecrate myſelf to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and good fortune united in the form of a woman. Whenever ſhe appeared, it was my buſineſs to get her if I could. This made me ſometimes a dancer at the Wells, in the days of my youth.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Miſs <hi>Spence</hi>'s reply to my addreſſes.</note>§. 8. As to Miſs <hi>Spence,</hi> ſhe was not cruel, but told me at laſt, after I had tired her with my addreſſes and petitions, that ſhe would conſider my caſe, and give me
<pb n="167-168" facs="tcp:0028500202:183"/>an anſwer, when I called at her houſe in <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> to which ſhe was then going: at preſent however, to tell me the truth, ſhe had very little inclination to change her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: ſhe was as happy as ſhe could wiſh to be, and ſhe had obſerved, that many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of her acquaintance had been made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy by becoming wives. The huſband generally proves a very different man from the courtier, and it is luck indeed, if a young woman, by marrying, is not undone—Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>mollia tempora fandi,</hi> as the poet calls it, the man may charm, when, like the god of eloquence, he pleads, and every word is ſoft as flakes of falling ſnow; but when the man is pleaſed to take off the maſk, and play the domeſtic hero; Gods! What miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have I ſeen in families enſue! If this were my caſe, I ſhould run ſtark mad.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Spence</hi>'s mentioning the memorable line from <hi>Virgil,</hi> ſurpriſed me not a little, as ſhe never gave the leaſt hint before, (though we had converſed then a fortnight) of her having any notion of the Latin tongue, and I looked at her with a raiſed admiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I replied in the following manner.— What you ſay, Miſs <hi>Spence,</hi> is true. But this is far from being the caſe of all gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. If there be ſomething ſtronger than virtue in too many of them, ſomething that maſters and ſubdues it; a paſſion, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, rebellious and lawleſs, which makes
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0028500202:184"/>them neglect ſome, high relations, and take the throne from God and reaſon; gaming, drinking, keeping; yet there are very many exceptions, I am ſure. I know ſeveral, who have an <hi>equal affection</hi> to goodneſs, and were my acquaintance in the world larger than it is, I believe I could name a large number, who would not prefer indulgence to virtue, or reſign her for any conſideration. There are men, madam, and young men, who allow a partial regard to rectitude is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent and abſurd, and are ſenſible, it is not certain, that there is abſolutely nothing <hi>at all</hi> in the evidences of religion: that if there was but even a chance for obtaining bleſſings of <hi>ineſtimable worth,</hi> yet a chance for <hi>eternal</hi> bliſs is worth ſecuring, by acting as the ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs holineſs of the Deity requires from us, and the reaſon and fitneſs of things makes neceſſary, in reſpect of every kind of relation and neighbour. This is the caſe of many men. They are not ſo generally bad as you ſeem to think.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, I would aſk, if there are no unhappy marriages by the faults of women? Are all the married ladies <hi>conſiſtently</hi> and <hi>thoroughly</hi> good, that is, <hi>effectually</hi> ſo? Do they all yield themſelves <hi>intirely</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally</hi> to the government of conſcience, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due every thing to it, and conquer every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe paſſion and inclination? Has reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0028500202:185"/>ways the ſovereignty, and nothing wrong to be ſeen? Are truth, piety, and goodneſs, the ſettled <hi>prevailing</hi> regard in the hearts and lives of all the married ladies you know? Have you heard of no unhappy marriages by the paſſions and vices of women, as well as by the faults of men? I am afraid there are too many wives as ſubject to ill habits as the men can be. It is poſſible to name not a few la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies who find their virtuous exerciſes, the duties of piety, and the various offices of love and goodneſs, as diſtaſteful and irkſome to them as they can be to a libertine or a cruel man. I could tell ſome ſad ſtories to this purpoſe: but all I ſhall ſay more is, that there are faults on both ſides, and that it is not only the ladies run a hazard of being ruined by marrying. I am ſure, there are as many men of fortune miſerable by the manners and conduct of their wives, as you can name la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies who are ſufferers by the temper and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their huſbands. This is the truth of the caſe, and the buſineſs is, in order to avoid the miſeries we both have ſeen among mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried people, to reſolve to act well and wiſely. This is the thing to be ſure, Miſs <hi>Spence</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. This will prevent faults on either ſide. Such a courſe as virtue and piety require muſt have a continued tendency to render life a ſcene of the greateſt happineſs; and it may gain infinitely hereafter.—Call upon me
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0028500202:186"/>then at <hi>Cleator</hi> as ſoon as you can, (Miſs <hi>Spence</hi> concluded, with her face in ſmiles) and we will talk over this affair again. Thus we chatted as we dined together in private, and early the next morning Miſs <hi>Spence</hi> left the <hi>Wells.</hi>

As to the place called <hi>Oldfield-Spaw,</hi> it is ſeven miles from <hi>Harrogate,</hi> and four from <hi>Rippon,</hi> lies on a riſing ground, between two high hills, near an old abbey, about five yards from a running ſtream, and in a moſt romantic delightful ſituation, which reſembles <hi>Matlock</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> (ten miles beyond <hi>Derby</hi> in the <hi>Peak</hi>) ſo very much, that one might almoſt take it for the ſame place, if conveyed there in a long deep ſleep. The ſame kind of charms and various beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are every where to be ſeen; rocks and mountains, groves and vallies, tender ſhrubs and purling currents, at once ſurprize and pleaſe the wandering eye.</p>

It is bright and ſparkling, and when poured into a glaſs, riſes up in rows like ſtrings of little beads. It has an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon taſte, quite different from all other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral waters that ever came in my way; but it is not diſagreeable. What impregnates it I know not. Dr. <hi>Rutty</hi> I ſuppoſe never heard of this water, for it is not in his valuable quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lately publiſhed; and Dr. <hi>Short,</hi> in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent hiſtory of mineral waters, (2 volumes 4 to. <hi>London,</hi> 1734) ſays little more than that there is a <hi>medicinal ſpring</hi> there. What I found upon trial is, that two quarts of it, ſwallowed as faſt as I could drink it in a morning, vomits to great advantage; and that four quarts of it, drank by degrees, at intervals, works off by ſiêge or ſtool, and urine, in a very beneficial manner. I was apprehenſive of a high fever from my night's hard drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Harrogate,</hi> (which I could not avoid) and the <hi>Oldfield-water,</hi> operating as related, carried off the bad ſymptoms, and reſtored me to ſanity in two day's time. This is all I can ſay of this fine water. It is very little in reſpect of what it deſerves to have ſaid of it.</p>

A vein of ſpar runs for ſeveral miles on this range of hills, and forms the bottom and lower ſides of the wells. It is a greyiſh ſpar, having poliſhed and ſhining ſurfaces of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar figures, interſperſed with glittering parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of a golden colour, which are very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and large.</p>
               <p>There are two medicinal ſprings or wells, which are ſeparated from one another by a ſmall rock: the <hi>higher well</hi> lies with its mouth ſouth eaſt. 'Tis of an irregular ſquare figure, and is about a foot and a half deep. The <hi>lower well</hi> is ſurrounded with naked rocks: it forms a ſmall arch of a circle. Its depth is four foot and a half, and by a moderate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the two ſprings yield 40 loads of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in 24 hours, each load containing 64 or 68 <hi>Scotch</hi> pints; a <hi>Scotch</hi> pint is two <hi>Engliſh</hi> quarts.—The higher ſhallow well is uſed for bathing, as it is not capable of being kept ſo clean as the lower well, on account of the ſhallowneſs and the looſeneſs of its parts.</p>
               <p>Theſe waters are ſtrongly ſulphureous, and reſemble the ſcourings of a foul gun, or rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eggs, or a weak ſolution of <hi>ſal polychreſtum,</hi> or <hi>hepar ſulphuris.</hi> The colour of the water ſomewhat milky or bluiſh.</p>
               <p>N. B. The ſoil on every ſide of the wells is thin, and the hills rocky, only juſt below the wells there is a ſmall moſs, cauſed by the falling of water from the hill above it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Virtues of theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note>Great is the medicinal virtue of theſe waters, in relieving, inwardly, cholics, pains in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, griping of the guts, bilious and nephritic colics; nervous and hyſteric colics; the gravel, by carrying off the quantities of ſand, (but does not diſſolve the ſlimy gravel) clearing the uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary paſſages in a wonderful manner; in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iſchuries, and ulcerated kidneys; the gout, the palſy, obſtructions of the menſes, old gleets, and barrenneſs: it is a ſovereign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in rheumatic and ſcorbutic pains, even when the limbs are monſtrouſly ſwelled, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and covered with ſcales.—Outwardly, ulcers, tumors, itch, St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s fire, and king's evil.</p>
               <p>The waters are uſed by bathing and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: to drink in the morning three chopins, ſix pints or a <hi>Scotch</hi> quart, four <hi>Engliſh</hi> quarts, at moſt: between the hours of ſix and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. After dinner to drink gradually.</p>
               <p>Medicines commonly uſed during the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the waters are, an emetic or two at firſt, and a few cathartic doſes. The doſes <hi>ſal Glauberi</hi> and <hi>polychreſtum:</hi> ſyrup of buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, and ſulphur, is uſed along with the water.</p>
               <p>But the cathartic preſcription moſt in uſe, which was given by an eminent phyſician, for a general recipe, to be taken by all who ſhould at any time uſe the water, is, pills that are a compoſition of gambozia, reſin of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0028500202:192"/>jalop, aloes, and ſcammony: theſe to all intents are a ſtrong hydragogue.</p>
               <p>The large vein of ſpar three feet thick, runs in one direction for ſix miles to the wells, and croſſes obliquely the rivulet at the bottom of the precipice, and aſcends the hill on the oppoſite ſide. Small veins of the ſame ſpar which appears on the precipices, are on the ſide of the rivulet, and ſix ſmall guſhes of water of the mineral kind proceed from them. The rocks and ſtones about the tops of the wells, and in other parts of the hill and precipices, differ not from common ſtones, no more than the water of the ſmall ſprings in the neighbourhood with the common water.</p>
               <p>The virtue of this water was diſcovered by Miſs <hi>Whiteford,</hi> daughter of Biſhop <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> in 1632. She was married in 1633. She had been abroad, and all over <hi>England,</hi> drinking mineral waters for the recovery of her health, but found little benefit, till by accident ſhe taſted theſe waters in her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and finding they reſembled thoſe ſhe had uſed elſewhere, made a trial of them, and was cured of all her diſorders.</p>
               <p>Upon this ſhe recommended the uſe of them to others, and employed workmen to clear the ground about the ſprings, (their overflowing having made a ſmall moraſs) that the poor and the rich might come,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0028500202:193"/>and make uſe of a medicine, which nature had ſo bounteouſly offered to them.</p>

                     <hi>May</hi> 19, 1731. A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a beautiful ſpot of ground, and a ſweet pretty country ſeat in the weſt-rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>
                  </note>§. 1. WHILE I was thinking in this manner of the ſun, and the author of it, I came into a ſilent unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glade, that was finely adorned with ſtreams and trees. Nature there ſeemed to be lulled into a kind of pleaſing repoſe, and conſpired as it were to ſoften a ſpeculative genius into ſolid and awful contemplations. The woods, the meadows, and the water, formed the moſt delightful ſcenes, and the charms of diſtant proſpects multiplied as I travelled on: but at laſt I came to a ſeat which had all the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0028500202:196"/>beauties that proportion, regularity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, can give a thing. The pretty man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſituated in the midſt of meadows, and ſurrounded with gardens, trees, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhades. A fountain played to a great height before the door, and fell into a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſervoir of water, that had foreign wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl ſwimming on its ſurface. The whole was very fine.</p>
               <p>Here I walked for ſome time, and after roaming about, went up to the houſe, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the beauties of the thing. I found the windows open, and could ſee ſeveral ladies in one of the apartments. How to gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance was the queſtion, and I began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive many ways; but while I was buſied in this kind of ſpeculation, a genteel footman came up to me, and let me know, his lady ſent him to inform me I might walk in and look at the houſe, if I pleaſed. So in I went, and paſſed through ſeveral grand rooms all finely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and filled with paintings of great price. In one of thoſe chambers the ſervant left me, and told me, he would wait upon me again in a little time. This ſurprized me, and my aſtoniſhment was doubled, when I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alone for almoſt an hour.<note place="margin">An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of two won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which played on the <hi>German</hi> flute.</note> No foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man returned: nor culd I hear the ſound of any feet. But I was charmingly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the while. In the apartment I was left in, were two figures, dreſſed like a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0028500202:197"/>ſhepherd and ſhepherdeſs, which amazed me very much. They ſat on a rich couch, in a gay alcove, and both played on the <hi>German</hi> flute. They moved their heads, their arms, their eyes, their fingers, and ſeemed to look with a conſciouſneſs at each other, while they breathed, at my entring the room, that fine piece of muſic, the maſquerade minuet; and afterwards, ſeveral excellent pieces. I thought at firſt, they were living creatures; but on examination, finding they were only wood, my admiration increaſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came exceeding great, when I ſaw, by ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their mouths, and ſtopping their fingers, that the muſic did not proceed from an organ within the figures. It was an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary piece of clock-work, invented and made by one <hi>John Nixon,</hi> a poor man.</p>

                  </note>§. 2. At length however, a door was opened, and a lady entred, who was vaſtly pretty, and richly dreſt beyond what I had ever ſeen. She had diamonds enough for a queen. I was amazed at the ſight of her, and wondered ſtill more, when, after being honoured with a low courteſy, on my bowing to her, ſhe aſked me in <hi>Iriſh,</hi> how I did, and how long I had been in <hi>England.</hi> My ſurprize was ſo great I could not ſpeak, and upon this, ſhe ſaid, in the ſame language, I ſee, Sir, you have no remembrance of me.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0028500202:198"/>You cannot recollect the leaſt idea of me. You have quite forgot young <hi>Imoinda,</hi> of the county of <hi>Gallway</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> who was your partner in country dances, when you paſſed the Chriſtmas of the year 1715, at her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe. What (I ſaid) Miſs <hi>Wolf</hi> of <hi>Balineſkay? O my Imoinda!</hi> And ſnatching her to my arms, I almoſt ſtifled her with kiſſes. I was ſo glad to ſee her again, and in the ſituation ſhe appeared in, that I could not help expreſſing my joys in that tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, and hoped ſhe would excuſe her <hi>Valentine,</hi> as I then remembred I had had that honour when we were both very young.</p>
               <p>This lady, who was good humour itſelf in fleſh and blood, was ſo far from being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at this ſtrange flight of mine, that ſhe only laughed exceſſively at the oddneſs of the thing; but ſome ladies who came into the apartment with her ſeemed frightened, and at a loſs what to think, 'till ſhe cleared up the affair to them, by letting them know who I was, and how near her father and mine lived to each other in the country of <hi>Ireland.</hi> She was indeed extremely glad to ſee me, and from her heart bid me welcome to <hi>Clankford.</hi> Our meeting was a vaſt ſurprize to both of us. She thought I had been in the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields, as ſhe had heard nothing of me for ſeveral years: and I little imagined, I ſhould ever find her in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0028500202:199"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> in the rich condition ſhe was in. She aſked me by what deſtiny I was brought to <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> and in return for my ſhort ſtory, gave me an account of herſelf at large. Till the bell rung for dinner, we ſat talking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then went down to as elegant a one as I had ever ſeen. There were twelve at table, ſix young ladies, all very handſome, and ſix gentlemen. Good humour preſided, and in a rational delightful chearfulneſs, we paſſed ſome hours away. After coffee, we went to cards, and from them to country dances, as two of the footmen played well on the fiddle. The charming <hi>Imoinda</hi> was my partner, and as they all did the dances extremely well, we were as happy a little ſet as ever footed it to country meaſure. Two weeks I paſſed in this fine felicity. Then we all ſeparated, and went different ways. What became of Miſs <hi>Wolf</hi> after this — the extraordinary events of her life — and the ſtories of the five ladies with her, — I ſhall relate in the ſecond volume of my <hi>Memoirs of ſeveral Ladies of Great Britain.</hi> Four of them were Mrs. <hi>Cheſlin,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Fanſhaw,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Chadley,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Biſſel;</hi> the fifth was Miſs <hi>Farmor;</hi> all mentioned in the Preface to the firſt volume of my Memoirs aforeſaid.<note place="margin">

               <p>§. 3. A fortnight, as ſaid, I ſtayed with Miſs <hi>Wolf,</hi> that was; but, at the time I am
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0028500202:200"/>ſpeaking of, the relict of Sir <hi>Loghlin Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibbons,</hi> an old <hi>Iriſh</hi> knight, who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely rich, and married her when he was creeping upon all-fours, with ſnow on his head, and froſt in his bones, that he might lie by a naked beauty, and gaze at that awful ſpot he had no power to enjoy. I did intend, on leaving this lady, to be at <hi>Knareſborough</hi> at night; but the fates, for a while, took me another way. At the inn where I dined, I became acquainted with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman much of my own age, who was an ingenious agreeable man. This was <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Wincup,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who had lately married Miſs <hi>Horner</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> a fine young creature, and a great fortune. This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by his good humour, and ſeveral good ſongs, pleaſed me ſo much, that I drank more than I intended, and was eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to go with him, in the evening, to <hi>Woodceſter,</hi> the name of his ſeat; which was but ten miles from the houſe we had dined at. We came in juſt as they were going to tea. There was a great deal of company, at leaſt a dozen ladies, beſides half a ſcore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and all of them as gay and engaging as the beſt-bred young mortals could be.</p>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0028500202:201"/>of ſeveral ground rooms, (ten I think) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from one another, and ſeparated by trees and banks of flowers. They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of wood, but finely put together, and all diſpoſed with the greateſt ſymmetry and beauty. They were very handſome without ſide, and the inſide furniſhed and adorned with the fineſt things the owner could get for money. Eaſy hills, little vallies, and pretty groves, ſurrounded the ſweet retreat, and the vallies were watered with clear ſtreams. The whole had a fine appearance. The varied ſcenes for ever pleaſed.</p>

But country dances were the chief diverſion; and I had a partner, who was not only a wonder in face and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (divinely pretty) but did wonders in every motion. This was Miſs <hi>Veyſſiere</hi> of <hi>Cumberland:</hi> the dear creature! Reader, when I was a young fellow, there were few could equal me in dancing. The famous <hi>Paddy Murphy,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> member of the houſe of commons, commonly called the <hi>Little Beau,</hi> well known at <hi>Lucas</hi>'s coffee-houſe, <hi>Dublin:</hi> (He danced one night, in 1734, that I was at the caſtle, before the late Duke of <hi>Dorſet</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0028500202:202"/>and his Ducheſs, at their grace's requeſt:) this gentleman, and <hi>Langham,</hi> the miller, who danced every night at the renowned <hi>Stretch</hi>'s puppet-ſhew, before the curtain was drawn up, were both deſervedly admired for their performance in the hornpipe; yet were nothing to me in this particular: but Miſs <hi>Veyſſiere</hi> out-did me far: her ſteps were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and ſhe did them with that amazing agility, that ſhe ſeemed like a dancing angel in the air. Eight nights we footed it together, and all the company ſaid, we were born for each other. She did charm me, and I ſhould have aſked her the queſtion, to try her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if <hi>Wincup</hi> had not told me, her father intended to ſacrifice her to a man old enough to be her grandfather, for the ſake of a great jointure; and in a week or two ſhe was to dance the <hi>reel of Bogee</hi> with an <hi>old monk.</hi>— Poor Miſs <hi>Veyſſiere!</hi> I ſaid; What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion can there be between the <hi>hoary churl</hi> and you,</p>

                  </note>§. 6. Another of our diverſions at <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> was a little company of ſingers and dancers Mr. <hi>Wincup</hi> had hired, to perform
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0028500202:203"/>in a ſylvan theatre he had in his gardens. Theſe people did the <hi>mime,</hi> the <hi>dance,</hi> the <hi>ſong,</hi> extremely well. There was among them one Miſs <hi>Hinxworth,</hi> a charming young creature, who excelled in every thing; but in ſinging eſpecially, had no equal I believe in the world. She was a gentleman's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and had been carried off by one <hi>O Regan,</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> and dancing-maſter, the head of this company. He was the moſt active fellow upon earth, and the beſt harlequin I have ever ſeen. Every evening we had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other extraordinary from theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers. He gave us two pieces which ſo nearly reſembled the two favourite entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments called <hi>Harlequin Sorcerer,</hi> and the <hi>Genii,</hi> (tho' in ſeveral particulars better) that I cannot help thinking Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> owed his <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequin Sorcerer</hi> to <hi>O Regan:</hi> and that the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii</hi> of <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> was the invention of this <hi>Iriſhman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You know, reader, that in the firſt ſcene of <hi>Harlequin Sorcerer,</hi> there is a group of witches at their orgies in a wilderneſs by moon-light, and that harlequin comes riding in the air between two witches, upon a long pole: Here <hi>O Regan</hi> did what was never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted at <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> houſe, and what no other man in the world I believe did ever do. As the witches danced round and round, hand in hand, as ſwift as they could move,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0028500202:204"/>
                  <hi>O Regan</hi> leaped upon the ſhoulder of one of them, and for near a quarter of an hour, jumped the contrary way as faſt as they went, round all their ſhoulders. This was a fine piece of activity. I think it much more wonderful, than to keep at the top of the outwheel of a water-mill, by jumping there, as it goes with the greateſt rapidity round.

The firſt of <hi>June,</hi> 1731, at five in the morning, I took my leave of honeſt <hi>Wincup,</hi> as chearful and worthy a fellow as ever lived, and ſet out for <hi>Knareſborough;</hi> but loſt my way, went quite wrong, and in three hours time, came to a little blind ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, the ſign of the Cat and Bagpipe, in a lone ſilent place.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0028500202:205"/>came to <hi>England</hi> to try his fortune, as he told me, and married an old woman, who kept this public-houſe, the ſign of the Cat, to which <hi>Tom</hi> added the Bagpipe. As he had been a waiter at his brother's houſe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to have ſeen me often there, and was rejoiced at my arrival at the Cat and Bagpipe. He got me a good ſupper of trouts, fine ale, and a ſquib of punch, and after he had done talking of all the gallant fellows that uſed to reſort to his brother <hi>Martin</hi>'s, ſuch as the heroes of Trinity-college, <hi>Dublin,</hi> Captain <hi>Maccan</hi> of the county of <hi>Kerry,</hi> and many more, he let me go to ſleep.</p>

The next morning, betimes, I was up, and walked into a wood adjoining to <hi>Clancy</hi>'s houſe. I ſauntered on for about an hour eaſily enough, but at laſt came to a part of the foreſt that was almoſt impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Curioſity incited me to ſtruggle on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, if poſſible, that I might ſee what country was before me, or if any houſe was to be found in this gloomy place: this coſt me a couple of hours, much toil, and many ſcratches; but at length, I arrived at the edge of a barren moor, and beyond it, about a quarter of a mile off, ſaw another wood. Proud to be daring, on I went, and ſoon came to the wood in view, which I found
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0028500202:206"/>cut into walks, and arrived at a circular ſpace ſurrounded with a foreſt, that was above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards every way. In the center of this was a houſe, encloſed within a very broad deep mote, full of water, and the banks on the inſide, all round, were ſo thick planted with trees, that there was no ſeeing any thing of the manſion but the roof and the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Over the water was one narrow draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, lifted up, and a ſtrong door on the garden ſide of the mote. Round I walked ſeveral times, but no ſoul could I ſee: not the leaſt noiſe could I hear; nor was there a cottage any where in view. I wondered much at the whole; and if I had had my lad <hi>O Finn</hi> with me, and my pole, I would moſt certainly have attempted to leap the foſs, broad as it was, and if it was poſſible, have known who were the occupants of this ſtrange place. But as nothing could be done, nor any information be had, I returned again to the Cat and Bagpipe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Character of Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Cock,</hi> an old lawyer.</note>It was ten by the time I got back, and at breakfaſt I told <hi>Clancy,</hi> my landlord, where I had been, and aſked him if he knew who lived in that wonderful place. His name (he replied) is <hi>Cock,</hi> an old lawyer and limb of the devil, and the moſt hideous man to behold that is upon the face of the earth. Every thing that is bad and ſhocking is in his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0028500202:207"/>compound: he is to outward appearance a monſter: and within, the miſer, the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, the villain. He is deſpiſed and abhorred, but ſo immenſely rich, that he can do any thing, and no one is able to contend with him. I could relate, ſays <hi>Tom,</hi> a thouſand inſtances of his injuſtice and cruelty; but one alone is ſufficient to render his memory for ever curſed. Two gentlemen of fortune, who had employed him ſeveral years in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and had a good opinion of him, on account of a canted uprightneſs and ſeeming piety, left him ſole guardian of a daughter each of them had, and the management of fifty thouſand pounds a-piece, the fortune of theſe girls, with power to do as he pleaſed, without being ſubject to any controul, 'till they are of age. Theſe ladies, as fine crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as ever the eye of man beheld, he has had now a year in confinement in that priſon you ſaw in the wood; and while he lives, will keep them there to be ſure, on account of the hundred thouſand pounds, or till he diſpoſe of them to his own advantage, ſome way or other. He intends them, it is ſaid, for two ugly nephews he has, who are now at ſchool, about fourteen years old, and for this purpoſe, or ſome other as bad, never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to ſtir out of the garden ſurrounded by the mote, nor lets any human creature vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0028500202:208"/>them. They are greatly to be pitied, but bear the ſevere uſage wonderfully well. One of them, Miſs <hi>Martha Tilſton,</hi> is in her twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year; and the other, Miſs <hi>Alithea Llan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoy,</hi> in her nineteenth. They are girls of great ſenſe, and would, if any kind of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offered, make a brave attempt to eſcape: but that ſeems impoſſible. They are not only ſo ſtrictly confined, and he for ever at home with them, except he rides a few miles; but are attended continually in the garden, when they walk, by a ſervant who is well paid, and devoted to the old man her maſter. This makes them think their ſtate is fixed for life, and to get rid of melancholy, they read, and practice muſic. They both play on the fiddle, and do it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fine.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Clancy</hi> had done, and I was much more ſurprized at his relation than at the place of their reſidence which I had ſeen. I became very thoughtful, and continued for ſome time with my eyes fixed on the table, while I revolved the caſe of theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate young ladies. But is all this true? (at laſt I ſaid): Or only report? How did you get ſuch particular information?—I will tell you, <hi>Tom</hi> anſwered. Old <hi>Cock</hi> is my land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, and buſineſs often brings me to his houſe in the wood, to pay my rent, or aſk
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0028500202:209"/>for ſomething I want. Beſides, I ſometimes bring a fat pig there, and other things to fell. My daughter likewiſe has ſometimes a piece of work in hand for the ladies, and ſhe and I take a walk with it there by a better and ſhorter way than you went. You cannot think how glad they are to ſee us, and they let me into all their perplexities and diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>On hearing this, a ſudden thought of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerviceable to theſe ladies came into my head, and I was going to aſk a queſtion in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, when two horſemen rode up to the door, and one of them called <hi>Houſe!</hi> This, ſays my landlord, is old <hi>Cock</hi> and his man; and immediately went out to him, to know his will. He told him, he came for the ride-ſake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſee if any letters were left for him by that day's poſt at his houſe, and would dine with him if he had any thing to eat. That I have, (the man replied), as fine a fowl, bacon and greens, as ever was ſerved up to any table, and only one gentleman, a ſtranger and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, to ſit down to it. <hi>Cock</hi> upon this came into the room I was ſitting in, and after look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very earneſtly at me, ſaid, Your ſervant, Sir. I told him I was his moſt humble, and right glad to meet with a gentleman for ſociety in that lone place. I immediately began a ſtory of a cock and a bull, and made the old fellow grin now and then. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0028500202:210"/>him among other things, that I was travelling to <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> to look after ſome eſtates I had there, but muſt hurry back to <hi>London</hi> very ſoon, for my wife was within a few weeks of her time. You are a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man then, Sir, he replied. Yes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and ſo ſupremely bleſt with the charms and perfections, the fondneſs and obedience of a wife, that I would not be unmarried for all the world: few men living ſo happy as I am in the nuptial ſtate.—Here dinner was brought in, and to ſave the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man trouble, I would cut up the fowl. I helped him plentifully to a ſlice of the breaſt, and the tips of the wings, and picked out for him the tendereſt greens. I was as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant as it was poſſible, and drank his health many times. The bottle after dinner I put about pretty quick, and told my old gentleman, if affairs ever brought him up to <hi>London,</hi> I ſhould be glad to ſee him at my houſe in <hi>Golden-Square,</hi> the very next door to Sir <hi>John Heir</hi>'s; or, if I could be of any ſervice to him there, he would oblige me very much by letting me know in what way. In ſhort, I ſo buttered him with words, and filled him with fowl and wine, that he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well pleaſed, eſpecially when he found there was nothing to pay, as I informed him it was my own dinner I had beſpoke, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0028500202:211"/>dined with double pleaſure in having the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his moſt agreeable company. He was a fine politician, I ſaid, and talked extremely well of the government and the times: that I had received more true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from his juſt notions, than from all I had read of men and things, or from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with any one. The glaſs during this time was not long ſtill, but in ſuch toaſts as I found were grateful to his Jacobite heart, drank brimmers as faſt as opportunity ſerved, and he pledged me and cottoned in a very diverting way. He grew very fond of me at laſt, and hoped I would ſpare ſo much time, as to come and dine with him the next day. This honour I aſſured him I would do myſelf, and punctually be with him at his hour. He then rid off, brim full, and I walked out to conſider of this affair. But before I proceed any farther in my ſtory, I muſt give a deſcription of this man.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of old <hi>Cock</hi> the lawyer.</note>
                  <hi>Cock,</hi> the old lawyer and guardian, was a low man, about four feet eight inches, very broad, and near ſeventy years old. He was humped behind to an enormous degree, and his belly as a vaſt flaſket of garbage projected monſtrouſly before. He had the moſt hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing look I have ever ſeen. His brows were prodigious, and frowning in a ſhocking man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; his eyes very little, and above an inch
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0028500202:212"/>within his head; his noſe hooked like a buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, wide noſtrils like a horſe, and his mouth ſparrow. In this caſe, was a mind quite cunning, in the worſt ſenſe of the word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, artful, deſigning and baſe. There was not a ſpark of honour or generoſity in his ſoul.</p>
               <p>How to circumvent this able one, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the two beauties from his oppreſſive power, was the queſtion: it ſeemed almoſt impoſſible; but I reſolved to do my beſt. This I told <hi>Clancy,</hi> and requeſted, as I was to dine with <hi>Cock</hi> the next day, that he would be there in the morning, on ſome pretence or other, and let the ladies know, I offered them my ſervice, without any other view than to do them good; and if they accepted it, to inform me by a note, ſlipt into my hand when they ſaw me, that if they could direct me what to do, I would execute it at any hazard, or let them hint the leaſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that might have any tendency to their freedom in ſome time to come, though it were three months off, and I would wait for the moment, and ſtudy to improve the ſcheme. This my landlord very carefully acquainted them with, at the time I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and by two o'clock I was at <hi>Cock</hi>'s houſe, to ſee theſe beauties, and know what they thought of the ſervice offered them.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0028500202:213"/>The old man received me much civiler than I thought he would do when he was ſober, and had, what my landlord told me was a very rare thing in his houſe, to wit, a good dinner that day. Juſt as it was brought in, the ladies entred, (two charming creatures indeed), and made me very low courteſies, while their eyes declared the ſenſe they had of the good I intended them. <hi>Cock</hi> ſaid, theſe are my nieces, Sir, and as ſoon as I had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted them, we ſat down to table. The eldeſt carved, and helped me to the beſt the board afforded, and young as they were, they both ſhewed by their manner, and the little they ſaid, that they were women of ſenſe and breeding. They retired, a few minutes after dinner, and the youngeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, in going off, to give me a billet in an inviſible manner. I then turned to <hi>Cock</hi> intirely, heard him abuſe the government in nonſenſe and falſhoods, as all <hi>Jacobites</hi> do; and after we had drank and talked for better than an hour, took my leave of him very willingly, to read the following note.</p>

               <p>What to do then I could not tell; but as I rid back I conſulted with my lad O <hi>Fin,</hi> who was a very extraordinary young man, and aſked him what obſervations he had made on the ſervants and place. He ſaid, he had tried the depth of the water in the mote all round, and found it fordable at one angle, waiſt high, and about two feet broad the rock he trod on. He had ſtripped, and walked it over to be ſure of the thing. As to the people, he fancied there was one young man, a labourer by the year under the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener, who would, for a reaſonable reward for loſing his place, be aiding in the eſcape of the ladies; for he talked with pity of them, and with great ſeverity of his maſter: that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0028500202:215"/>if I pleaſed, he would ſound this man, and let me know more in relation to him: that if he would be concerned, he could very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily carry the ladies on his back acroſs the water, as he was a tall man, and then we might take them behind us to what place we pleaſed: or, if it was not ſafe truſting this man, for fear of his telling his maſter, in hopes of more money on that ſide, then, he would himſelf engage to bring the ladies and their cloaths over, on his own back, with wetting only their legs, if they could be at the water-ſide ſome hour in the night. This was not bad to be ſure; but I was afraid to truſt the man; for, if he ſhould inform old <hi>Cock</hi> of the thing, they would be confined to their chambers, and made cloſe priſoners for the time to come. It was better therefore to rely entirely upon <hi>O Fin,</hi> if they could get into the garden in the night.</p>
               <p>In anſwer then to another letter I had from the ladies by my landlord's daughter the next morning, in which they lamented the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing impoſſibility of an eſcape, I let them know immediately the ſtate of the water, and deſired to be informed what they thought of the gardener's man; or, if he would not do, could they at any particular hour, get to that angle of the mote I named, to be brought over on my man's back, and then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ride off behind us on pillions, which
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0028500202:216"/>ſhould be prepared.mdash;Their anſwer was, that they dared not truſt any of Mr. <hi>Cock</hi>'s men, but thought my own ſervant would do, and the ſcheme reaſonable and ſeemingly ſafe, if they could get out. They gave me a million of thanks for my amazing care of them, and called the immortal powers to witneſs the high ſenſe they had of their unutterable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to me.</p>
               <p>Waiting then for them, I ſtaid at the little inn three days longer, and at laſt received a billet to let me know, that at twelve o'clock that night, which was the ſixth of <hi>June,</hi> they could, by an accident that had happened, be at the appointed place, and ready to go where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I pleaſed. To a minute my man and I were there, and in a few moments, <hi>O Fin</hi> brought them and their cloaths over ſafe. In an inſtant after they were behind us, and we rid away as faſt as we could. Six hours we travelled without ſtopping, and in that time, had gone about thirty miles. We breakfaſted very gaily at our inn, and when the horſes had reſted a couple of hours, we ſet out again, and rid till three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, when we baited at a lone houſe in a valley, called <hi>Straveret Vale,</hi> which had every rural charm that can be found in the fineſt part of <hi>Juan Fernandes.</hi> A young couple, vaſtly civil, kept here a ſmall clean public houſe, the ſign of the pilgrim, on the very
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0028500202:217"/>margin of a pretty river, and the plain things they had were as good as we could deſire. Their bread, their drink, their fowl, their eggs, their butter, cheeſe, vegetables, and bacon, were excellent, and as they had good beds, I thought we could not do better than lie by for two or three days in this ſweet place, 'till it was determined, where the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould fix. We were at leaſt fixty miles from old <hi>Cock</hi>'s houſe, and in an obſcurity that would conceal us from any purſuers; for we had kept the croſs roads and by-ways, and were on the confines of <hi>Weſtmoreland.</hi> Here then we agreed to reſt for a little time. In reality, it was juſt as I pleaſed. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were all acknowledgment for what I did to deliver them, and all ſubmiſſion to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. They had each of them thirty gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas in their purſes, as they ſhewed me, but what to do after that was gone, or where to go while it laſted, to be in ſafety, they could not tell.</p>
               <p>The affair perplexed me very much, and I turned it a thouſand ways, without being able to ſettle it as I would. I had two young heireſſes on my hands, who wanted more than a year of being at age, and I muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, and place them in ſome ſpot of decency, ſecurity, and peace, ſince I had gone thus far, or I had injured them greatly, inſtead of ſerving them, in bringing them
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0028500202:218"/>from their guardian's houſe. This took up all my thoughts for three days. I concealed however my uneaſineſs from them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make the houſe and place quite pleaſing to them. I kept up a chearfulneſs and gaiety, and we ſat down with joy and pleaſure to breakfaſt, dinner, and ſupper. Within doors, we played at cards, we ſung, and I entertained them with my <hi>German</hi>-flute. Abroad, we walked, fiſhed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I rowed them up the river in a boat the man of the houſe had. The whole ſcheme was really delightful, and as the girls had great quickneſs and vivacity, and were far from being ignorant, conſidering their few years, I could have wiſhed it was poſſible to ſtay there much longer: but it was no place for them, and I was obliged to call at <hi>Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> in a little time. I could not forget my promiſe to the lovely Miſs <hi>Spence.</hi> My ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was engaged, and there was no time to loſe. It is true, if I had not been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, I might immediately have married either the beautiful Miſs <hi>Tilſton,</hi> or the more beautiful Miſs <hi>Llandſoy,</hi> then become my wards; but as they were minors, if ſuch a wife died under age, I could be no gainer, and might have children to maintain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fortune. All theſe things ſat pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully on my ſpirits, and I was obliged at
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0028500202:219"/>laſt to make the following declaration to the ladies, which I did the third day after dinner.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Tilſton,</hi> Miſs <hi>Llandſoy,</hi> I am ſenſible you have too high an opinion of what I have done to ſerve you, and think there is more merit in it than there really is; for a man of any generoſity and ability would, I imagine, do all that was poſſible to deliver two young ladies of your charms and perfections, from the ſlavery and miſery your guardian kept you in: I am likewiſe ſure you believe I would do every thing in my power, to ſecure your happineſs, and give you the poſſeſſion of every bleſſing of time. I honour, I admire, I regard you both, to a high degree; and if I were ſome powerful <hi>genie,</hi> I would crown your lives with ſtable felicity and glory. But nature, ladies, has irrevocably fixed limits, beyond which we cannot paſs, and my ſphere of action is far from being large. My for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is not very great, and thereby prevents my being ſo uſeful a friend to you as I would willingly be. However, though it is not in my power to do according to my inclination, in regard to your caſe, and with ſecurity place you in ſome ſtation fit for your rank and worth, yet I can bring you to a ſpot of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and in ſtill life enable you to live without perplexity or care of any kind. You ſhall have peace and little, and may perhaps hereafter ſay, you have enjoyed more real
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0028500202:220"/>happineſs, for the time you had occaſion to reſide there, than you could find in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, pomp, and grandeur of the world.</p>
               <p>Here I gave the ladies an account of <hi>Orton-Lodge,</hi> in the northern extremity of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland,</hi> where I had lived a conſiderable time told them the condition it was in, the goods, the books, the liquors, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries and conveniencies that were there, and if, in that charming romantic ſpot, where no mortal could come to hurt them, they could bear to live for a while, I would ſettle them there, and get a man ſervant to work in the garden, and a couple of maids. I would likewiſe procure for them two cows, a few lambs, ſome poultry, and corn, and ſeeds for the ground: in ſhort, that they ſhould have every thing requiſite in ſuch a place; I would return to them as ſoon as poſſible; I would write to them often, directing my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the neareſt town, to be called for by their man. What do you ſay, ladies, to this propoſal? In <hi>London</hi> it is not poſſible for you to be: at a farm-houſe you might have no ſatisfaction: and any where that was known and frequented, you may be liable to diſcovery, as <hi>Cock,</hi> your guardian, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire every where; and if he hears of you, you will be carried home moſt certainly to his diſmal habitation, and be uſed ten times
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0028500202:221"/>worſe than before. What do you think then of this ſcheme?</p>
               <p>Sir, (they both replied) you are to us a ſubaltern power, by heaven ſent to deliver us from miſery, and ſecure our happineſs in this world. We have not words to expreſs the gratitude of our ſouls for this further inſtance of your goodneſs in the offer you make us, nor can it ever be in our power to make you the return it deſerves. You will be pleaſed to accept our grateful thanks, and all we have to add at preſent, our prayers for your preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and health. Conduct us, we beſeech you, immediately to that ſweet ſpot of peace you have deſcribed.</p>
               <p>This being agreed on, the next thing to be done was to get two horſes for the ladies, for mine were not able to carry double any further, if there had been a turnpike road before us; then up the mountains we were to go, where no double horſe could travel; and when they were at the Lodge, they would want horſes to ride ſometimes, or to remove, if the neceſſity of their caſe ſhould happen to require it: to my landlord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I applied upon the occaſion, and he very quickly got for me not only two pretty beaſts, but a young labouring man, and two country girls to wait upon the ladies. I then ſent to the next town for a couple of ſide-ſaddles, gave the ſervants directions to go to the Rev.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0028500202:222"/>Mr. <hi>Fleming</hi>'s houſe, to wait there till they heard from me, and then we ſet out for <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Ladge.</hi> Two days we ſpent in travelling there, feeding on cold proviſions we had with us, and lying a night on the fern of the mountains. The ſecond evening we arrived at the Lodge. There I found every thing ſafe, and the place as I had left it. I opened my various ſtore-houſes, to the ſurprize of the young ladies, and brought them many good things; biſcuits, potted char, potted black-cocks, ſweetmeats, and liquors of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds: <hi>O Fin</hi> likewiſe got us a diſh of trouts for ſupper, and the two beauties and I ſat down with chearfulneſs to our table.— Vaſtly amazed they were at all they ſaw. Every thing was ſo good, and the wild charms of the place ſo pleaſing, that they could not but expreſs the tranſports they were in at their preſent ſituation. The whole they ſaid, was charming as inchantment, and in language there was not a force ſufficient to expreſs their grateful ſentiments upon the occaſion. This gave me much pleaſure, and till the end of <hi>June,</hi> I lived a very happy life with theſe fine young creatures. They did all that was poſſible to ſhew their eſteem and gratitude. Excluſive of their amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fine faces, and perſons, they were ingenious, gay, and engaging, and made
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0028500202:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>every minute of time delightful. If I had not been engaged to Miſs <hi>Spence,</hi> I ſhould certainly have ſat down in peace with theſe two young ladies, and with them connected, have looked upon <hi>Orton-Lodge</hi> as the Garden of <hi>Eden.</hi> They were both moſt charming women. Miſs <hi>Llandſoy</hi> was a mere divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity!</p>

                     <hi>July</hi> 1, 1731. My depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Orton-Lodge</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time: miſſed my road: the country deſcribed.</note>§. 1. THE firſt of July, juſt as the day was breaking, I mounted my horſe, and went again from <hi>Orton-Lodge.</hi> The morning being extremely fine, and every thing appearing as in the above lines, I rid ſoftly on for three or four hours, and was ſo delighted with the beauties, and an infinite variety of lovely objects my eyes were feaſted with, that I did not mind the way; and inſtead of coming to the turning that was my road, I got into a bending valley, which ended at a range of rocky mountains. For half an hour I travelled by the bottom of theſe frightful hills, and came at length to a paſs through them, but ſo narrow, that the beaſts had not above an inch or two to ſpare on each ſide. It was dark as the blackeſt night in this opening, and a ſtream came from it, by the waters falling in ſeveral places from the top of the high incloſing precipices. It was as ſhocking a foot-way as I had ever ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0028500202:226"/>
                  <hi>Finn,</hi> (I ſaid to my young man) as the bottom is hard, and you can only be wet a little, will you try where this paſs ends, and let me know what kind of country and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are beyond it? That I will, ſaid <hi>O Finn,</hi> and immediately entred the cleft or crevice between the mountains. A couple of hours I allowed my adventurer to explore this dark way; but if in that time he could make nothing of it, then his orders were to return: but there was no ſign of him at the end of ſix hours, and I began to fear he had got into ſome pound. After him then I went, about one o'clock, and for near half a mile, the narrow way was directly forward, a rough bottom, and ancle deep in water; but it ended in a fine flowery green of about twenty acres, ſurrounded with ſteep rocky hills it was impoſſible to aſcend. Walking up to the precipice before me, I found many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns in it, which extended on either hand, and onwards, into a vaſt variety of caves; ſome of them having high arched openings for entrance, and others only holes to creep in at; but all of them ſpacious within, and high enough for the talleſt man to walk in.</p>
               <p>In theſe diſmal chambers I apprehended my fellow had loſt himſelf, and therefore went into them as far as I could venture, that is, without loſing ſight of the day, and cried out <hi>Finn! Finn!</hi> but could hear no
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0028500202:227"/>ſound in return. This was a great trouble to me, and I knew not what to do. Back however I muſt go to my horſes, and after I had ſpent two hours in ſearching, ſhouting, and expecting my lad's return, by ſome means or other, I was juſt going to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the crevice, or dark narrow paſs I had come through to this place, when caſting my eyes once more towards the caverns in the mountains, I ſaw my boy come out, leaping and ſinging for joy. He told me, he never expected to ſee the day-light more: for after he had fooliſhly gone too far into the caves, till he was quite in the dark, in hopes of finding a paſſage through the mountain to ſome open country, he was obliged to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from chamber to chamber he knew not where for many hours, without one ray of light, and with very little expectation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; that he did nothing but cry and roar, and was hardly able to ſtand on his legs any longer, when by a chance turn into a cave, he ſaw ſome light again, and then ſoon found his way out. Poor fellow! he was in a ſad condition, and very wonderful was his eſcape.</p>
               <p>After this, we made what haſte we could to our horſes, which we had left feeding in the vale, and <hi>Finn</hi> brought me ſome cold proviſions from his wallet for my dinner. I dined with great pleaſure, on account of the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0028500202:228"/>recovery of my lad, and when we had both recruited and reſted ſufficiently, on we went again. We found the valley winded about the mountains for three miles, and then end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the higheſt hill I had ever ſeen, but which it was poſſible to aſcend. With great difficulty we and our horſes got to the top of it, and down on the other ſide. Six mountains of the ſame height, whoſe tops were above the clouds, we had to croſs, and then arrived at a bottom, which formed a moſt delightful ſcene.</p>

                  </note>§. 2. The <hi>Vale of Keſwick,</hi> and <hi>Lake of Derwentwater,</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> are thought by thoſe who have been there, to be the fineſt point of view in <hi>England,</hi> and extremely beautiful they are, far more ſo than the Rev. Dr. <hi>Dalton</hi> has been able to make them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Deſcriptive Poem; (addreſſed to two ladies, at their return from viewing the coal-mines, near <hi>Whitehaven,</hi> that is, the late excellent Lord <hi>Lonſdale</hi>'s charming daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;) or than the Doctor's brother, Mr. <hi>Dalton,</hi> has painted them in his fine drawings; and yet they are inferior in charms to the vale, the lake, the brooks, the ſhaded ſides of the ſurrounding mountains, and the tuneful falls of water, to which we came in <hi>Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> In all the world, I believe, there is not a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0028500202:229"/>more glorious rural ſcene to be ſeen, in the fine time of the year.</p>
               <p>In this fine vale, I found one pretty little houſe, which had gardens very beautifully laid out, and uſefully filled with the fineſt dwarf fruit trees and ever-greens, vegetables, herbs, and ſhrubs. The manſion, and the improved ſpot of ground, were at the end of the beautiful lake, ſo as to have the whole charming piece of water before the door. The projecting ſhaded fells ſeemed to nod or hang over the habitation, and on either hand, a few yards from the front of the houſe, caſcades much higher than that of dread <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> fell into the lake. There is not any thing ſo beautiful and ſtriking as the whole in any part of the globe that I have ſeen: and I have been in higher latitudes, north and ſouth, than moſt men living. I have converſed with nations who live many degrees beyond the poor frozen Laplander. I have travelled among the barbarians who ſcorch beneath the burning zone.</p>

Who lived in this delightful val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, was, in the next place, my enquiry, after I had admired for an hour the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beauties of the place. I walked up to the houſe, and in one of the parlour windows, that had a view up the loch, I ſaw a young beauty ſitting with a muſic-book

She could not ſee me, but I had a full view of her fine face, and as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to have ſeen her ſomewhere, I ſtood gazing at her with wonder and delight, and was ſtriving to recollect where I had been in her company, when another young one came into the room, whom I had reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member very well, on account of an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and then I knew they were the two young ladies I had ſeen at Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s. (ſee p. 374. of <hi>Memoirs of ſeveral Ladies of Great Britain,</hi>) and admired very greatly for the charms of their perſons, and the beauties of their minds. Upon this I walked up to the window, and after a little aſtoniſhment at ſeeing me, they behaved with the greateſt civility, and ſeemed to be highly pleaſed with the accidental meeting. While we were talking, their mamma came into the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and on their letting her know who I was, and where they had been acquainted with me, the old lady was pleaſed to aſk me to ſtay at her houſe that night, and to aſſure me ſhe was glad to ſee me, as ſhe had often heard her daughters ſpeak of me. Three days I paſſed with great pleaſure in this ſweet place, and then with regret took my leave.

The 5th of <hi>July</hi> I left Mrs. <hi>Thurloe</hi>'s, and by the aſſiſtance of a guide, had a fine ride to the houſe of Friar <hi>Fleming,</hi> in <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondſhire,</hi> where I arrived by noon. I dined with this good <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> and ſhould have lain there that night, but that I could not help being melancholy, on miſſing my dear friend <hi>Tom,</hi> the Monk's brother, who died of a fever, as before related. From him then I parted in the evening, and rid to a <hi>Carthuſian monaſtry,</hi> which conſiſted of ſeven monks, men of ſome eſtate, who had agreed to live together in this remote place, and paſs their lives in piety, ſtudy, and gardening. I had a letter from <hi>Fleming</hi> to one of theſe gentlemen, the ſuperior, letting him know I was his near friend, and deſiring he would receive me as himſelf; that, although a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, I was of no party, but in charity with all mankind. This letter procured me all the kindneſs and honours theſe gentlemen could ſhew me. They behaved with great civility and tenderneſs, and gave me the beſt they had, good fiſh, good bread, good wine, excellent fruit, and fine vegetables; for as to fleſh, they never eat any, by their rule.</p>
               <p>They were all learned and devout men, very grave and ſilent for the moſt part, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0028500202:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>when viſited, but without any thing ſtiff or moroſe in their manner. They had a large collection of books, and ſeemed to underſtand them well. What time they had to ſpare from the hours of divine ſervice, and working in their gardens, according to the rule of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> which they follow, they give to ſtudy, and had many volumes of their own writing; being moſtly old MSS. they had tranſcribed, <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> Making ſuch copies was their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal work in the cloſet.</p>

                        </note> Reader, that you may the better underſtand the converſation I had with this learned <hi>Carthuſian,</hi> I muſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0028500202:233"/>inform you what the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and other writings of the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> are.—</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Talmud</hi> is a celebrated piece of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> literature, that is full of <hi>Rabinical</hi> domination and enthuſiaſm. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> pretend, this book contains the <hi>Oral</hi> laws, and other ſecrets, which God communicated to <hi>Moſes.</hi> It conſiſts of two parts, each of which is divided into ſeveral books. In the firſt part, which they call <hi>Miſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> is the <hi>text.</hi> In the other, is a ſort of <hi>comment</hi> on the text, and this is ſtiled the <hi>Gemara.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This oral law, or tradition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected after the deſtruction of the Temple, A. D. 150, by <hi>Rabbi Judah,</hi> and is by them preferred before the ſcripture. They ſuppoſe it was orally delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and unlawful to be written; but when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed, they were conſtrained to write it, leaſt it ſhould be loſt; but yet it was ſo written, as that none but themſelves might underſtand it.—This <hi>Miſhna</hi> and <hi>Gemara</hi> compleat the two <hi>Talmuds:</hi>—that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> A. D. 230;—and that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> 500 years after Chriſt. Many parts of theſe <hi>Talmuds</hi> are tranſlated by ſeveral learned men, who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to render them intelligible: but in order to underſtand them fully, you muſt read the <hi>Jad Chaſka,</hi> or <hi>Miſhna Torah</hi> of <hi>Moſes Maimonides,</hi> who was phyſician to the king of <hi>Egypt</hi> about 600 years ago. This <hi>Rabbi</hi> hath comprized the ſubſtance of the <hi>Miſhna</hi> and <hi>Gemara</hi> of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> in his books, and enabled us to underſtand all the <hi>Miſhna</hi> with eaſe and pleaſure. See likewiſe the <hi>Clavis Talmudica, Cock's Excerpta,</hi> and the works of the excellent <hi>Ludivicus de Campeigne du Veil,</hi> who had been a <hi>Jew,</hi> but became a <hi>Roman Catholic;</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> went over to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where he was for ſeveral years in the character of a great divine: but at laſt turned <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and died a member of that chriſtian church; which loſt him all his friends and intereſt.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0028500202:234"/>He died the beginning of this century, with the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an upright Chriſtian and a moſt learned man. There is no tolerable account given of him in any of the Biographical Dictionaries. What they ſay is ſhort and next to nothing. And the <hi>Popiſh</hi> accounts are not only ſhort, but falſe, and mere calumny.—I took a great deal of pains ſome years ago, to collect among the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and from others who knew this great man, every thing I could get relating to him and his works, and formed what I had got into a life of him, which I did intend to inſert in this place: but by ſome accident or other, it is gone. I cannot find it any where.</p>

                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0028500202:232"/>We obtain from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0028500202:233"/>thence a knowledge of the cuſtoms and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which afford ſome benefit. In the next place, they ſerve to the confirmation
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0028500202:234"/>of the hiſtory of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for it appears by the <hi>Babyloniſh Talmud,</hi> that there was one <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who had diſciples, lived in ſuch and ſuch a place, and did and ſaid divers things; and in the Bible many texts relating to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> are confirmed and explained by theſe books of the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> though not by them intended. This I have ſince found to be the truth of the caſe. I have read the works of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſince, and find it to be as the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſian</hi> ſaid. For example;</p>
               <p>It is ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15. <hi>I will put enmity between thy ſeed and her ſeed. It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> Now the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Onkelos</hi> gives the ſenſe thus: The man ſhall be mindful of, or remember, what thou (ſatan) haſt done to him in times paſt, and thou ſhalt obſerve, <hi>watch</hi> or <hi>haunt</hi> him till the end of days; that is, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or devil ſhould purſue and have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the world till the <hi>laſt days,</hi> and then the <hi>prince of this world ſhould be caſt out,</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0028500202:235"/>and the <hi>works of the devil</hi> deſtroyed. <hi>Beacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith Heyamim,</hi> the <hi>end of days,</hi> or <hi>laſt days,</hi> is, by a general rule, given by the moſt learned <hi>Rabbins,</hi> meant of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> So <hi>Kimchi</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> ii. 2.—and <hi>Abarbriel</hi> and <hi>R. Moſes Nachm</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> xlix. 1. inform us.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe very remarkable, that the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that of <hi>Jonathan Ben Uziel,</hi> apply this place to the coming of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> They give the words the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſenſe. — I will put enmity between thy ſeed and her ſeed: when the ſons of the woman keeping my law, they ſhall bruiſe thy head, and when they break my law, thou ſhalt bruiſe their heel; but the wound given to the ſeed of the woman, ſhall be healed, but thine ſhall be incurable; they ſhall be healed in the <hi>laſt days,</hi> in the days of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>—Such is the opinion of the moſt learned <hi>Jews:</hi>—and from thence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have not put their ſenſe upon the text I have cited to ſerve their own turn; the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> we ſee, give the very ſame meaning to the place.</p>
               <p>Again in <hi>Numb.</hi> xxiv. 17. we have the famous prophecy of <hi>Balaam: There ſhall come a ſtar out of Jacob, and a ſceptre ſhall riſe out of Iſrael.</hi> — In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xi. 1. it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>And there ſhall come forth a rod out of the ſtem of Jeſſe, and a branch ſhall grow out of his roots, and the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0028500202:236"/>upon him.</hi> And in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> xxiii. 5.6. <hi>Behold the days ſhall come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto David a righteous branch,</hi>—<hi>and this is his name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> That the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> apply theſe <hi>texts</hi> to the Meſſias, I need not inform the reader: but it muſt be grateful to obſerve, that the paraphraſes of <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelos, Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> all of them expreſsly attribute the <hi>prophecy</hi> of <hi>Balaam</hi> to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And <hi>Rabbi Moſes Hadarſan</hi> and <hi>Maimon,</hi> ſay, he is here called a <hi>Star,</hi> (which ſignifies what <hi>Malachi</hi> expreſſes by the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> Mal. iv. 2. and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> by the <hi>Eaſt. I will bring forth my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the Eaſt.</hi> Zach. iii. 8. as it is tranſlated in the <hi>Vulgar, Septuagint, Arabic,</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riac</hi>) is here, ſay theſe <hi>Rabbins,</hi> called a <hi>Star,</hi> becauſe he ſhould come and deſtroy <hi>idolatry,</hi> among the heathen nations, by becoming <hi>a light to the gentiles,</hi> and <hi>the glory of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the other two texts, the Jews do likewiſe attribute them to the <hi>Meſſias. Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Joſeph Albo,</hi> ſpeaking of the words, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> in particular, ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly, that this is one name given to the <hi>Meſſias. Albo, Sep. ikker.</hi> lib. 2. c. 28. Thus do the <hi>Jews</hi> concur with us in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>texts</hi> to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they cannot tell. They
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0028500202:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>are amazed, perplexed, and confounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. They diſpute on the article, and have the wildeſt fancies in relation to it. Whereas the Chriſtians give a clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent account of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and by every argument that can be deſired by a rational, prove the truth of chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Again: in <hi>Iſa.</hi> ix. 6. we have theſe words: <hi>Unto us a child is born, unto us a ſon is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders: and his name ſhall be called Wonderful, Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi> Or as the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> MS. hath it, <hi>He ſhall call his name the Angel, Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, Counſellor, Mighty, the Governor, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the age to come.</hi> This is thought by all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be a plain declaration of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> for to apply it to any mere mortal, as to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s ſon, cannot be done without the greateſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity: and therefore <hi>Ben Maimon (epiſt. ad Afric.)</hi> fairly yields that theſe words belong to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Jonathan Ben Uziel</hi> in his <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphraſe. The <hi>Talmud</hi> itſelf allows it. <hi>Tract. Sanhedrim.</hi> that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to a perſon not come in the time of the <hi>prophets,</hi> but to the man, whoſe name is the <hi>Branch, which was to come forth out of the ſtem of Jeſſe, and to grow out of his roots. My ſervant the Branch. Behold the man whoſe name is the Branch.</hi> Zech. iii. 8. and ch. xii.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0028500202:238"/>and Iſa. iv. 1. <hi>Even the perſon that ſhall be ſent; Shilo,</hi> that <hi>remarkable perſon</hi> God had promiſed to his people. So ſays the <hi>Talmud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further; as to the birth of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in reſpect of the manner and the place, it is thus ſet down by the prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> v. 2. <hi>And thou Bethlehem Ephrata, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Iſrael; whoſe goings forth have been of old, even from everlaſting.</hi>—And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> vii. 14. are theſe words, <hi>Behold a virgin ſhall conceive, and bring forth a ſon, and call his name Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel.</hi> In theſe two texts, (the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſay) the <hi>place</hi> of the <hi>birth</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the <hi>manner</hi> of it, are as plainly deſcribed as words can do; and if they cannot, without abſurdity, be explained as relating to any other perſon, then it muſt be perverting the meaning of the records, to oppoſe this expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but this the <hi>Jews</hi> are far from doing. The <hi>place</hi> is acknowledged in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> in the <hi>Chaldee paraphraſe</hi> of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and all their moſt famous <hi>maſters</hi> declare with one voice, that <hi>Bethlehem</hi> indiſputably belongs to the <hi>Meſſias. Exte Bethlehem coram me prodibit Meſſias, ut ſit dominium exercens in Iſrael, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus nomen dictum eſt ab aeternitate, a Diebus ſeculi. (Talmud. lib. Sanhedrim, et Midraſch. The hillinic Rabbi Selemoh. paraph. Jonath. in Loc. Rabbi David Kimchi.)</hi>—And as to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0028500202:239"/>the <hi>manner,</hi> tho' it be true that ſome <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Gnalma</hi> ſignifies a <hi>young woman</hi> as well as a <hi>virgin;</hi> yet <hi>Kimell, Jarchi,</hi> and <hi>Selemoh,</hi> three of their greateſt <hi>Rabbins,</hi> confeſs that here is ſomething won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful preſaged in the birth and generation of this perſon, and that he was not to be born as other men and women are born. What can we deſire more, in the caſe, from an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? And in truth, the <hi>behold,</hi> or wonder, with which the text begins, would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if it was only that a young woman ſhould have a child: — and as to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Gnalmah,</hi> if it ever does ſignify a young women, which I very much doubt, yet in the tranſlation of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> who well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the original ſurely, they render the word by <hi>parthenos,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>in <hi>Graec;</hi> which always ſignifies a virgin in the ſtrict propriety of the phraſe. And in the <hi>Punic</hi> language, which is much the ſame as the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the word <hi>Alma</hi> ſignifies a <hi>virgin, virgo intacta,</hi> and never means a young woman.</p>
               <p>Such are the advantages we may gain by reading the books of the <hi>Rabbins;</hi> and to me it is pleaſing to ſee theſe great <hi>Hebrew maſters</hi> granting ſo much to us for our <hi>Meſſias,</hi> while they hate our holy religion beyond every thing. Even the <hi>gay</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> (if I have been truly informed by one who danced a night with them) have, in contempt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence

In this chaſm, you will find petrified twigs of trees, ſhrubs, and graſs-roots, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in moſt beautiful pillars, all interwoven, and forming many charming figures; and on the common ſide are whole banks like <hi>Stalac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilites,</hi> hard and inſeparable from the rock, where the water trickles down. Theſe <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefactions,</hi> the <hi>falling water,</hi> and the little <hi>iſthmus</hi> or iſland being beautifully cloathed with aſh, oſier, elm, ſambucus, ſervicana major, geraniums, wood-mercury, hart's-tongue, ſage, ladies mantle, cowſlips, wild angelica, &amp;c. form all together a delightful ſcene. — The firſt ſpring of this water is out of a ſmall hole on the little mountain, in the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0028500202:243"/>middle of a thick-ſet of ſhrubs. It ſends out 20 gallons in a minute of the ſweeteſt water in the world, and it is 24 grains in a pint heavier than common water.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on petrifying waters.</note>Moſt people are of opinion, that <hi>petrifying water</hi> is dangerous drink, and may produce abundance of miſchief, in cauſing the ſtone and gravel in the body: the original particles or principles of the ſtony ſubſtance called <hi>ſpar,</hi> which are in abundance ſuſpended in this kind of water, muſt get into the flood-gates of the kidneys and ureters, (as they opine) and create great miſery in a little time.</p>
               <p>But this fear of <hi>petrefactions</hi> in living ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal bodies is grounded upon neither reaſon nor experience; for the <hi>ſpar</hi> in theſe waters forms no <hi>petrefactions,</hi> whilſt in a briſk mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in a temperate ſeaſon, or on vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables while they preſerve their vegetating life.

Beſides, if the <hi>minims</hi> of <hi>ſpar</hi> are not within the ſpheres of ſenſible attraction, whilſt in motion; much leſs are they ſo when mingled with the fluids of the human body: you may therefore very ſafely drink theſe limpid petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying waters at all times, as a common fluid, if they come in your way, as the beſt, and moſt grateful or pleaſant water in the world, on account of the infiniteſimals, or original

Human invention has nothing equal to them for fluxes of any part of the body, or colliquations from an acid ſalt. So far are they from being in the leaſt dangerous, that in all unnatural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, by ſpitting, ſtool, or urine; by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive menſtrual or haemorrhoidal fluxes, in the fluor albus, diabetes, profuſe ſweatings; in the diarrhoea, dyfentry, or lienteria (where the ſprings are not quite worn out:) in ulcers of the viſcera, hectic fevers, atrophy, and colliquations or night ſweats, there is not any thing in phyſic more profitable or pleaſant, to recover a patient. Let your doſe, in ſuch caſes, be three half-pints of <hi>Knareſborough dropping-well</hi> in the forenoon; and before you begin to drink this water, remember to take two doſes of rhubarb, to cleanſe off the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the firſt viſcera. You muſt not drink ale, drams, or punch, during a courſe of theſe waters: and take but very little red port. You muſt likewiſe have a ſtrict regard to diet. Let it be milk, eggs, jellies, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-broth, chickens, kid, lamb, and the like. You muſt avoid all ſalt, ſharp, ſtimulating things, day-ſleep, and night-air: but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſation, and diverſions that require very little exerciſe, conduce to the ſucceſs of

The way to it is not eaſy, for there is no other paſſage than along a very narrow ledge, about nine inches broad, which has been cut off the rock over the deep river, and if you ſlip, (as you may eaſily do, having nothing to hold by) down you go into a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that looks very black and ſhocking, by the ſhade of the hanging precipice, and ſome aged trees which project from the vaſt cliff.</p>

                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0028500202:250"/>while he had ſome money, built the little houſe I ſaw on a piece of ground he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, and provided ſuch neceſſaries and comforts as he imagined might be wanting: he had a few good books, the bible, ſome hiſtory, and mathematics, to make him wiſer and better, and abroad he diverted himſelf moſtly in his garden, and with fiſhing: for fifteen years paſt he had not been in any town, nor in any one's houſe, but converſed often with ſeveral of the country people, who came to drink the mineral-water: what he had freſh occaſion for, one or other of them brought him, according to his written di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and the money he gave them, and once or twice a week he was ſure of ſeeing ſomebody: as the people knew he was not rich, and lived a harmleſs life, they were far from being his enemies, and would do any thing in their power to ſerve the hermit, as they called him: but he ſeldom gave them any trouble. His food was biſcuit, honey, roots, fiſh, and oil; and his drink, water, with a little rum ſometimes: He was never ſick, nor melancholy; but by a life of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and action, and a religion of truſt and reſignation, enjoyed perpetual health and peace, and run his latent courſe in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing expectation of a remove, when his days were paſt, to the bright manſions of the bleſt.</p>

Such was the account Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> gave me of himſelf, (which made me admire him much, as he was but fifty then) and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me his temper had nothing Timonean or unſocial in it from his ſolitary life, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted I would dine with him. He enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me with an excellent pickled trout and biſcuit, fine fruit, and a pot of extraordinary honey: with as much creme of tartar as lay on a ſixpence, fuſed in warm water, he made half a pint of rum into good punch, and he talked over it like a man of ſenſe, breeding, and good humour. We parted when the bowl was out, and at my going away, he made me a preſent of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing MS. and told me I might print it, if I could think it would be of any uſe to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

                     <note place="margin">Diſcourſe on the rule of reaſon.</note>Reaſon informs us there is a <hi>ſuperior Mind,</hi> endued with knowledge and great power, preſiding over human affairs; ſome original, independent Being, compleat in all poſſible perfection, of boundleſs power, wiſdom and goodneſs, the Contriver, Creator, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of this world, and the inexhauſtible ſource of all good.

As far as we can make obſervations, original intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and power appear to reſide in a Spirit, diſtinct from all diviſible, changeable, or moveable ſubſtance; and if we can reaſon at all, it muſt be clear, that an original omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Mind is a <hi>good Deity,</hi> and eſpouſes the cauſe of virtue, and of the univerſal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; will gloriouſly compenſate the <hi>worthy</hi> in a future ſtate, and then make the vicious and oppreſſive have cauſe to repent of their contradicting his will.

All our happineſs and excellency is from his bounty, and therefore not unto us, not unto us, but to his name be the praiſe. And can there be a joy on earth ſo ſtable and tranſporting as that which riſes from living with an habitual ſenſe of the Divine Preſence, a juſt perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of being approved, beloved and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him who is infinitely perfect and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent?</p>

By <hi>reaſon</hi> we likewiſe find, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the paſſions produce miſery, and iniquity makes a man compleatly wretched and deſpicable: but integrity and moral worth ſecure us peace and merit, and lead to true happineſs and glory. Unleſs reaſon and inquiry are baniſhed, vice and oppreſſion muſt have terrible ſtruggles againſt the principles of humanity and conſcience. Reflection muſt raiſe the moſt torturing ſuſpicions, and all ſtable ſatisfaction muſt be loſt: but by cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating the high powers of our reaſon, and acquiring moral excellence, ſo far as human nature is able; by juſtice and the benevolent affections, virtue and charity, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with, and affixed to the Deity, and with the inward applauſes of a good heart, we have the outward enjoyment of all the felicities ſuitable to our tranſitory condition. Happy ſtate ſurely! There are no horrors here to haunt us. There is no dreadful thing to poiſon all parts of life and all enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>Let us hearken then to the <hi>original law of reaſon,</hi> and follow God and nature as the ſure guide to happineſs. Let the offices of piety and beneficence be the principal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of our time; and the chief work of our every day, to ſecure an happy immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, by equity, benignity, and devotion. By continual attention, and internal diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, reaſon can do great things, and enable
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0028500202:255"/>us ſo to improve the ſupreme and moſt god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like powers of our conſtitution, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties impoſed upon us by our Creator, that when we return into that ſilence we were in before we exiſted, and our places ſhall know us no more, we may paſs from the unſtable condition of terreſtrial affairs to that eternal ſtate in the heavens, where ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting pleaſures and enjoyments are prepared for thoſe who have lived in the delightful exerciſe of the powers of reaſon, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all ſocial and kind offices to others, out of a ſenſe of duty to God.

We have hiſtories which relate an early deviation from moral truth, and inform us that this diſeaſe of our rational nature ſpread like a contagion. The caſe became worſe, and more deplorable, in ſucceeding ages; and as evil examples and prejudices added new force to the prevailing paſſions, and reaſon and liberty of will, for want of due exerciſe, grew weaker, and leſs able to regain their loſt dominion, corruption was rendered univerſal. Then did the true God, the Father of the Univerſe, and the moſt provident and beneficent of Beings, interpoſe by a revelation of his will, and by advice and authority, do all that was poſſible, to prevent the ſelf-deſtructive effects of the culpable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and folly of his offspring. He gave the world a <hi>tranſcript</hi> of the <hi>law of nature</hi> by an extraordinary meſſenger, the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who had power given him to work miracles, to rouſe mankind from their fatal ſtupidity, to ſet their thoughts on work, and to conciliate their attention to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly declaration. In this <hi>republication</hi> of the <hi>original law,</hi> he gave them doctrines and commandments perfectly conſonant to the pureſt reaſon, and to them annexed <hi>ſanctions</hi> that do really bind and <hi>oblige</hi> men, as they not only guard and ſtrengthen religion, but
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0028500202:257"/>affect our natural <hi>ſenſibility</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſhneſs.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion appears to great diſadvantage, when divines preach it into a <hi>bond of indemnity,</hi> and a <hi>mere contract of intereſt;</hi> but excluſive of this, it muſt be allowed, that the <hi>ſanctions</hi> of the goſpel have a weight, awfulneſs, and ſolemnity, that prove to a great degree effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> are reaſons for well-doing.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, the evidence of the obligation of the duties of natural religion is as <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> from <hi>reaſon,</hi> as any <hi>revelation</hi> can make it; but yet the means of rendering theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>effectual</hi> in practice, are not ſo clear and powerful from mere reaſon, as from revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The proof of obligation is equally <hi>ſtrong</hi> in reaſon and inſpiration, but the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation itſelf is rendered <hi>ſtronger</hi> by the goſpel, by ſuperadded means or motives. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary obligation of natural religion ariſes from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of things, as being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our rational moral faculties, agreeably to which we cannot but be obliged to act; and this obligation is <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> by the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of natural religion to the final hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of every rational agent: but the clear knowledge, and expreſs promiſes which we have in the goſpel, of the nature and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this final happineſs, being added to the obligation from, and the tendency of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or natural religion to the final happineſs
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0028500202:258"/>of human nature, the obligation of it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtill more ſtrengthened. In this lies the benefit of chriſtianity. It is the <hi>old,</hi> uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt religion of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> intirely free from <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>immorality;</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and taught in the moſt rational and eaſy way, and enforced by the moſt gracious and powerful <hi>motives.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Of the Myſteries, Trinity, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Croſs.</note>But if this be the caſe, it may be aſked, Where are our holy myſteries—and what do you think of our Redemption? If natural reaſon and conſcience can do ſo much, and to the goſpel we are obliged only for a little more light and influence, then Trinity in Unity, and the Sacrifice of the Croſs are nothing. What are your ſentiments on theſe ſubjects?</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> it is a word invented by the doctors, and ſo far as I can find, was never once thought of by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his apoſtles; unleſs it was to guard againſt the ſpread of <hi>tritheiſm,</hi> by taking the greateſt care to inculcate the <hi>ſupreme divinity</hi> of <hi>God the Father:</hi> but let it be a trinity, ſince the church will have it ſo, and by it I underſtand one Uncreated, and one Created, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain divine virtue of quality. Theſe I find in the Bible, <hi>God, Jeſus the Word,</hi> and a <hi>Divine Aſſiſtance</hi> or <hi>Holy Wind,</hi> (not Holy Ghoſt, as we have tranſlated it): called a <hi>Wind,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, <hi>from whom every good and perfect
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0028500202:259"/>gift cometh,</hi> gave the moſt extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it under the emblem of a <hi>Wind;</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe it was ſupernatural. This is the ſcripture doctrine, in relation to the <hi>Deity,</hi> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the <hi>Energy</hi> of God; of which the <hi>Wind</hi> was promiſed as a pledge, and was given as an emblem, when the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was come; and if theſe three they will call a Trinity, I ſhall not diſpute about the word. But to ſay <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is God, though the apoſtles tell us, that <hi>God raiſed from the dead the Man Jeſus Chriſt, whom they killed; that he had exalted him at his right hand, and had made him both Lord and Chriſt;</hi> and to affirm that this <hi>Ghoſt</hi> (as they render the word <hi>Wind</hi>) is a perſon diſtinct and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the perſon of God the Father, and equally ſupreme;—this I cannot agree to. If the ſcripture is true, all this appears to me to be falſe. It is a mere invention of the Monks.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Redemption,</hi> it may be in perfect conſiſtence and agreement with truth and rectitude, if the accompliſhment of it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as <hi>premial,</hi> and as reſulting from a <hi>perſonal reward:</hi> but to regard the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment as <hi>penal,</hi> and as reſulting from a <hi>vicarious puniſhment,</hi> is a notion that cannot be reconciled to the principle of rectitude. Vicarious puniſhment or ſuffering appears an impoſſibility: but as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by adding the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0028500202:260"/>moſt extenſive benevolence to perfect inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and by becoming obedient to death, even the death of the croſs, was moſt <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,</hi> and was entitled to the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and moſt diſtinguiſhed reward, <hi>his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> might be <hi>our deliverance from the bonds of ſin and death,</hi> and the <hi>reſtoration of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi> This reward was worthy of the giver, and tended to the advancement and ſpread of virtue. It was likewiſe moſt acceptable to the receiver. It no way interfered with right and truth. It was in all reſpects moſt proper and ſuitable. Theſe are my ſentiments of Redemption. This appears to me to be the truth on the moſt attentive and impartial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination I have been capable of making.</p>
                  <p>To this, perhaps, ſome people may reply, that though theſe notions are, for the moſt part juſt, and in the caſe of redemption, in particular, as innocence and puniſhment are inconſiſtent and incompatible ideas, that it was not poſſible Chriſt's oblation of himſelf could be more than a <hi>figurative ſacrifice,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>tranſlation of guilt, commutation of perſons,</hi> and <hi>vicarious infliction;</hi> though a <hi>real ſacrifice</hi> in the ſenſe of intending by the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to procure the <hi>favour of God,</hi> and the <hi>indemnity of ſinners:</hi> yet, as the author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a <hi>Socinian,</hi> his account is liable to objections. For, though the <hi>Socinians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth and neceſſity of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0028500202:261"/>of the goſpel, yet, in the opinion of ſome great divines, they interpret it in ſuch a manner, as no unprejudiced perſon, who has read the ſcriptures, with any attention, nor any ſenſible heathen, who ſhould read them, can poſſibly believe. They make our Redeemer a man, and by this doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect the greateſt diſhonour on chriſtianity, and its Divine Author.</p>
                  <p>This is a hard charge. The <hi>Socinians</hi> are by theſe divines deſcribed as people who read the ſcriptures with prejudice, and without attention; men more ſenſeleſs than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and as wicked too; for, in the higheſt degree, they diſhonour Chriſt Jeſus and his religion. Aſtoniſhing aſſertion! It puts me in mind of an imputation of the celebrated <hi>Waterland</hi> in his ſecond charge;—"What atheiſm chiefly aims at, is, to ſit looſe from preſent reſtraints and future reckonings; and theſe two purpoſes may be competently ſerved by <hi>deiſm,</hi> which is a <hi>more refined kind of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm.</hi> —Groundleſs and ridiculous calumny. <hi>True and proper deiſm</hi> is a <hi>ſincere belief of the exiſtence of a God,</hi> and <hi>of an impartial diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of rewards and puniſhments in another world, and a practice that naturally reſults from, and is conſonant to ſuch belief;</hi> and if atheiſm aims to ſit looſe from reſtraints and reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, then of conſequence, <hi>deiſm</hi> is the <hi>grand barrier</hi> to the purpoſes of atheiſm. The <hi>true
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0028500202:262"/>Deiſt</hi> is ſo far from breaking through reſtraints, that he makes it the great buſineſs of his life <hi>to diſcharge the obligations he is under,</hi> becauſe he <hi>believes in God,</hi> and perceives the <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of <hi>duties, reſtraints,</hi> and <hi>future reckonings.</hi> The <hi>aſſertion</hi> therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates the <hi>prejudice</hi> of Dr. <hi>Waterland,</hi> in relation to the <hi>Deiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the caſe is the ſame in reſpect of the <hi>charge</hi> againſt the <hi>Socinians.</hi> It is the <hi>divines</hi> that are prejudiced againſt them; and not the <hi>Socinians</hi> in ſtudying the New Teſtament. It is the grand purpoſe of our lives to <hi>worſhip God,</hi> and <hi>form our religious notions according to the inſtructions of divine wiſdom.</hi> We exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſacred writings, with the utmoſt deſire, and moſt ardent prayer, that we may be rightly informed in the trueſt ſenſe of the holy authors of thoſe divine books; and it appears to our plain underſtandings, after the moſt honeſt labour, and wiſhes to heaven for a clear conception of holy things, that <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the ſupreme God,</hi> that is, the firſt and chief Being, and Agent; the firſt and chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; the Fountain of Being, Agency, and authority: that the <hi>Chriſtian Meſſiah,</hi> the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus, was ſent into the world to bear witneſs to the truth, and preach the goſpel of the kingdom of God, that kingdom of God which is within you,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 21. not a <hi>kingdom of Monks,</hi> a <hi>ſacerdotal empire</hi> of <hi>power, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0028500202:263"/>and <hi>ceremonies.</hi> He came to <hi>call ſinners to repentance</hi> and <hi>amendment of life,</hi> to <hi>teach them the law of love,</hi> and <hi>aſſure man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind of grace and mercy</hi> and <hi>everlaſting glory,</hi> if they kept the commandments, and were obedient to the laws of heaven; laws of <hi>righteouſneſs, peace, giving no offence,</hi> and <hi>unanimity in the worſhip of the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> but that, if they did not <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>ceaſe</hi> to be <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious;</hi> if they did not open their eyes, and turn from darkneſs to light, from the power of ſatan unto God, and put on ſuch an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uſeful temper and behaviour, as would render them a <hi>bleſſing</hi> in the creation, they would be numbered among the <hi>curſed,</hi> and periſh everlaſtingly, for <hi>want</hi> of <hi>real good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and a <hi>general ſincerity of heart.</hi> This the <hi>Socinians</hi> think is what <hi>Chriſt</hi> propoſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, as the only and the ſure way to God's favour, through the <hi>worthineſs</hi> of the <hi>Lamb that was ſlain.</hi> We ſay this is pure religion. It is true, original chriſtianity, and if the glorious deſign of our Lord is anſwered by his <hi>miracles</hi> and <hi>preaching,</hi> by his <hi>death,</hi> his <hi>reſurrection,</hi> his <hi>aſcenſion,</hi> and by the <hi>grace of the holy, bleſſed, and ſanctifying Spirit,</hi> it could reflect no diſhonour on chriſtianity, and its divine author, if our Redeemer was a <hi>meer man.</hi> If by the aſſiſtance of God Almighty, a <hi>mere man</hi> performed the whole work of our
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0028500202:264"/>redemption, all we had to do was to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the mighty bleſſing. The love of God in this way had been equally ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The worth of Jeſus would be ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable.</p>
                  <p>But it is not the opinion of the <hi>Socinians</hi> that Chriſt was a <hi>mere man.</hi> It is plain from this aſſertion, that the Rev. Dr. <hi>Heathcote,</hi> (in his Remarks on free and candid Diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) knows nothing of them: the account they give of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is very different. They ſay, he was a moſt glorious agent united to a human body, and ſo far from being a <hi>mere man,</hi> that he was ſuperior to angels. He was the next in character to the neceſſarily exiſting Being. He is the brightneſs of the Father's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon: he has an excellency tranſcendent, and to the life repreſents what is infinitely great and perfect.</p>
                  <p>If they do not allow that he made the worlds, or had an eternal generation; if they ſay, he had no exiſtence till he was formed by the power of God in the womb, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert this eminency is proper to the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> yet they are far from affirming he was therefore a <hi>mere man:</hi> no; they believe he was decreed to be as great and glorious as poſſible, and that God made the world for him; that he was made the <hi>image</hi> of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible perſon</hi> of the <hi>Father; an image the moſt
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0028500202:265"/>expreſs and exact;</hi> as great as God himſelf could make it; and of conſequence, ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent in all perfections, that what he ſays and does is the ſame thing as if God had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and acted. This is not making him a <hi>mere man.</hi> No: they ſay he is the <hi>firſt of all,</hi> and the <hi>head of all creatures,</hi> whom the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love of God produced, to promote great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, glory, and happineſs among the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the ſuperlative greatneſs and glory of Jeſus; and that angels, and the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, might have the pleaſure of beholding and enjoying the preſence of this moſt glorious Image, that is, of ſeeing their inviſible Creator in his <hi>Image Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He is not a <hi>mere man;</hi> but the <hi>brightneſs of the glory of God,</hi> the <hi>expreſs Image of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and raiſed ſo much higher than <hi>the angels,</hi> as he has inherited from God a more excellent name than they, to wit, the name of <hi>Son,</hi> and is the <hi>appointed heir of all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that this <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> reflects no diſhonour on Chriſtianity and its Divine Author. It conduces as much to the glory of God, and the benefit of man, as any chriſtianity can do. There is ſomething vaſtly beautiful and ſatisfactory in the notion of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> being the <hi>moſt glorious Image</hi> of the <hi>inviſible Father,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his exiſtence began. The many tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent excellencies of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in <hi>whom
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0028500202:266"/>all fulneſs dwells,</hi> are exerciſed upon men to their happineſs, and to his glory; and we learn from thence, that greatneſs and glory are the reſult of the exerciſe of virtue to the relief and happineſs of others. The Redeemer of the world is, in this account, the next in dignity and power to the Great God; and the perfections of the Father do moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſhine forth in him. We are hereby made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light, and delivered from the power of darkneſs. We give thanks unto the Father, who hath tranſlated us into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Son of his love.</p>
                  <p>It is certain then that the divines have <hi>miſrepreſented</hi> the people, who are <hi>injuriouſly</hi> called <hi>Socinians,</hi> as the religion they profeſs is <hi>Scripture-Chriſtianity:</hi> I ſay <hi>injuriouſly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in the firſt place, the word <hi>Socinian</hi> is intended as a term of great reproach to chriſtians, who deſerve better uſage for the <hi>goodneſs of their manners,</hi> and the <hi>purity of their faith:</hi> and in the next place, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> was ſo far from being the author of our religion, that he was not even the firſt reſtorer of it. He did not go to <hi>Poland</hi> to teach the people there his religious notions, but becauſe there was a unitarian congregation there, with whom he might join in the <hi>worſhip of the Father, through Jeſus the Mediator,</hi> as his
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0028500202:267"/>conſcience would not ſuffer him to aſſemble with thoſe who worſhip <hi>a Being compounded of three divine perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is time to have done, and I ſhall conclude in the words of a good author in old <hi>French</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Or rather in bad <hi>French,</hi> as the writer was no <hi>Frenchman.</hi>

Get this book, if you can. It is the fineſt defence of your Bible that was ever publiſhed. (Steinfurti, A. 1611. edit. Vorſt.) And yet, ſuch is the <hi>malignity</hi> of <hi>orthodoxy,</hi> that a late great prelate, Dr. <hi>Smalbroke,</hi> Bp. of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> (who died A. D. 1749) could not help blackening the author when he mentioned the work: his words are theſe; — "And if <hi>Grotius</hi> was more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſſiſted by the <hi>valuable</hi> performance of a writer, <hi>otherwiſe juſtly of ill fame,</hi> I mean, <hi>Fauſtus Socinus</hi>'s little book <hi>De Auctoritate S.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0028500202:271"/>the clergy of St. David</hi>'s, p. 34. — Here the admirable <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> a man of as much piety, and as good morals, as hath lived ſince the apoſtles time, who truly and godly ſerved the almighty and everlaſting God, through our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, is painted by this eminent hand <hi>a man of ill fame;</hi> and for no other reaſon but becauſe his heavenly religion made him oppoſe the <hi>orthodox hereſy of three Gods,</hi> as taught in the <hi>creed of Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius;</hi> and piouſly labour, by the purity of his doctrine and example, to keep the world from corruption.</p>
                  <p>Let us then be careful to confeſs the holy <hi>unitarian faith.</hi> Let us take the advice of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and be <hi>original chriſtians.</hi> Let there not be in our religion <hi>a God compounded of three ſupreme ſpirits, equal in power and all poſſible perfections.</hi> Let us worſhip the <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Father,</hi> the <hi>firſt and chief Almighty Being,</hi> who is <hi>one ſupreme univerſal Spirit,</hi> of <hi>peerleſs Majeſty;</hi> and, as the inſpired apoſtles direct, let us worſhip him through his <hi>moſt glorious Image,</hi> the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> our <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Mediator,</hi> our <hi>King</hi> and our <hi>Judge.</hi>

                  <p>N. B. Though the reverend <hi>Dr. Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote</hi> hath been very <hi>unfriendly</hi> in his account of the Chriſtians he calls <hi>Socinians,</hi> in his Obſervations before mentioned, yet you are not from thence to conclude that he belongs
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0028500202:272"/>to the <hi>Orthodox Party.</hi> He is far from it. and therefore I recommend to your peruſal not only his <hi>Curſory Animadverſions upon free and candid Diſquiſitions,</hi> and his finer Boyle-Lecture Sermons on the Being of God, but alſo his <hi>Curſory Animadverſions upon the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, concerning the miraculous Powers,</hi> and his <hi>Remarks on Chapman's Credibility of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Miracles.</hi> They are three excellent pamphlets.

               <p>This letter ſurprized me. Yes, dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſaid, I will make <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> my way to <hi>London.</hi> At four in the morning I mounted my horſe, and rid to <hi>Cleator.</hi> I arrived there at ſix in the evening, and had travelled that day 75 miles; to wit, from

                  <hi>Harrogate</hi> to <hi>Boroughbridge,</hi> 8; from thence to <hi>Catarric,</hi> 22; to <hi>Gretabridge,</hi> 15; to <hi>Bows,</hi> 6; to <hi>Brugh</hi> in <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> 12; to <hi>Kirkby-Steven,</hi> near <hi>Wharton-Hall,</hi> 6; to <hi>Cleator,</hi> 6: — 75 miles. I dined at <hi>Catarric</hi> on a hot pigeon-pye juſt drawn, and ale of one ear, that is, admirable, (as <hi>Rabelais</hi> means by the phraſe, "We had wine of one ear," alluding to the one ſhake of the head to the right ſhoulder, when a thing is excellent); and I gave the horſes another feed of corn at <hi>Bows,</hi> the <hi>George,</hi> kept by <hi>Railton</hi> the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker (an excellent inn, and the maſter of it an inſtructive and entertaining orator).

                     <p>While I waited at the inn, till the horſes had eaten their corn, the landlord brought me a paper, dropt, by a lady he knew not, ſome days before at his houſe. He added, it was a curioſity, and worth my ſerious conſideration.</p>

                                 <p>This prayer pleaſed me very much. In the moſt beautiful manner, as well as in a few words, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes all we need aſk from heaven; and if Miſs <hi>Dudgeon</hi> of <hi>Richmondſhire</hi> was the compoſer of it, as I have been aſſured ſince, upon enquiry, I here place it to her honour, as a monument of her piety and ſenſe; and in hopes the illuſtrious of her ſex will uſe ſo ſhort and excellent a form of devotion in their cloſets morning and night.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0028500202:277"/>
There is an expreſſion in this prayer, which for ſome time I could not well comprehend the meaning of; that is, <hi>Make my heart one:</hi> but on conſidering it, I found it ſupported by the greateſt authorities.</p>
                                 <p>Among the ſayings of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> one is, be <hi>ſimply thyſelf.</hi> Reduce thy conduct to <hi>one ſingle aim,</hi> by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every paſſion into ſubjection, and acquiring that general habit of ſelf-denial, which comprehends tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, moderation, patience, government, and is the main principle of wiſdom. Be ſimply thyſelf, and ſo curb deſire, and reſtrain the inclinations, and controul the affections, that you may be always able to move the paſſions as reaſon ſhall direct. Let not every foremoſt fancy, or every forward appearance, have the leaſt maſtery over you; but view them on every ſide by the clear light of reaſon, and be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther influenced by the imaginations of pleaſure, and apprehenſions of evil, than as the obvious <hi>relations and nature of things</hi> allow. Let the reſult of a perception which every rational mind may have of the eſſential difference between good and evil, the be <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>ground of obligation.</hi> This will add greatly to quiet, and be productive of much real felicity. It will render every preſent condition ſupportable, brighten every proſpect, and always incline us more to hope than to fear. This is the doctrine of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>I likewiſe find that <hi>David</hi> expreſſes the ſame thought in the 86th Pſalm, ver. 11. which is rendered in the Bible tranſlation, <hi>Unite my heart to fear thy name;</hi>—in the Common-Prayer Book, <hi>O knit my heart unto thee,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0028500202:278"/>that I may fear thy name:</hi> but the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, "<hi>Make my heart one,</hi> to fear thy name;" meaning, Let the fear of thee be the <hi>one ruling diſpoſition</hi> of my ſoul, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>double-minded</hi> man, which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly expreſſes by a <hi>heart and a heart;</hi> one that draws to the riches, pleaſures, and honours of this world; and another to the practice of all virtue.</p>
                                 <p>As to the other part of the prayer, which has the words—<hi>glorious—fearful—Jehovah;</hi>—whereas in the 86th Pſalm it is only ſaid—"to fear thy name;" the author certainly took them from the 28th chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> ver. 58. The deſign of the dreadful threatnings in this chapter ſet before the people, is there thus expreſſed,—<hi>that thou mayeſt fear this glorious and fearful name,</hi> JEHOVAH THY GOD; (in our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>the Lord thy God</hi>). And therefore I think theſe words are very finely uſed in this prayer.</p>
                                 <p>"It is amazing to me (ſays the <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>St. Mabyn</hi>), that throughout the Bible, the tranſlators have every where changed the word <hi>Jehovah</hi> for the word <hi>Lord,</hi> when God himſelf gave the word <hi>Jehovah</hi> as his name to be uttered; and as in this word the whole myſtery of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian diſpenſations ſeem to have been wrapped up.</p>
                                 <p>Say to the people, <hi>Ami Jehovah. I am Jehovah. Ye ſhall know that I Jehovah am your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egygtians.</hi> Exod. vi. 6, 7. And <hi>Deut.</hi> vi. 4. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Then as to this word's comprehending the two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, a good writer obſerves that, though God was known to his true worſhippers by many other
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0028500202:279"/>names, as <hi>God Almighty, the High God, the Everlaſting God, &amp;c.</hi> yet <hi>Jehovah</hi> was his one <hi>peculiar</hi> name; a name which he had appointed to himſelf, in preference to all others, and by which he declared by <hi>Moſes</hi> he would be diſtinguiſhed for the time to come.</p>
                                 <p>And as of all the names of God, this ſeems to be the moſt expreſſive of his eſſence, as it can only be derived from the <hi>root</hi> which ſignifies <hi>to be,</hi> and denotes the <hi>one eternal ſelf-exiſtent Being, from whom</hi> all other things <hi>derive their being,</hi> and <hi>on whom</hi> they muſt depend; —As the word does likewiſe ſignify <hi>makes to be what was promiſed or foretold,</hi> and by ſuch meaning declares, as often as the word is repeated, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> our God is not only <hi>ſelf-exiſtent,</hi> and the <hi>Creator of the world,</hi> but <hi>Him in whom all divine prophecies and predictions centre;</hi> it follows, in my opinion, that we ſhould utter this <hi>awful name</hi> in our addreſſes to God, and not, like the <hi>Jews,</hi> through a ſuperſtition omit it, and uſe another inſtead of it."</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>N. B.</hi> The <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>St. Mabyn</hi> is the Rev. Mr. <hi>Peters;</hi> and the paſſage is to be found in an excellent Preface to the octavo edition of his admirable <hi>Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the Book of Job,</hi> in reply to that part of the <hi>Divine Legation of Moſes demonſtrated,</hi> in which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, my Lord of <hi>Glouceſier,</hi> ſets himſelf to prove, that this <hi>book</hi> is a <hi>work of imagination,</hi> or <hi>dramatic compoſition,</hi> no older than <hi>Ezra</hi> the prieſt, whom he ſuppofes to be the writer of it, in the year before Chriſt 467, or the year 455, in the 20th year of the reign of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> when <hi>Daniel</hi>'s ſeventy weeks begins; that is, the period of 490 years, that were to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled before the paſſion of our Saviour. And further,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0028500202:280"/>(according to the author of the <hi>Legation</hi>), that this <hi>allegorical drama</hi> or <hi>poem</hi> was written to ſquiet the minds of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> people under the difficulties of their captivity, and to aſſure them, as repreſented by the perſon of <hi>Job,</hi> of thoſe great temporal bleſſings which three prophets had predicted.</p>
                                 <p>Now in the Preface to the book aforementioned, in anſwer to all this (and fully and beautifully anſwered it is), you will find, I ſay, the paſſage relating to the word <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and more than I have quoted from it.</p>
                                 <p>As to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the <hi>Samean,</hi> mentioned in this note, on account of his ſaying—<hi>Be ſimply thyſelf;</hi>—he was famous in the 60th olympiad, as <hi>Jamblicus</hi> informs us; that is, his <hi>Elikia,</hi> or <hi>Reign of-Fame,</hi> began in the firſt year of this olympiad, which was the year before <hi>Chriſt</hi> 540; for 60 × 4 gives 250 − 777 leaves 537 + 3, the plus years of the olympiad; <hi>i. e.</hi> 2, 3, 4 = 540.—And he died in the 4th year of the 70th olympiad, that is, the year before Chriſt 497: for 70 × 4 = 280 − 777 remains 497: there are no plus years to be added here, as it happened in the 4th or laſt year of the olympiad. This philoſopher was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with, and a near friend to, the renowned <hi>Phalaris,</hi> who was murdered in the year before Chriſt 556, when the <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> aſcended the throne of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> lived to the age of 90, according to <hi>Diogenes,</hi> he muſt have been born in the beginning of the reign of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> the year this conqueror took <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and its king <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> which was olymp. 47.3. and of conſequence before Chriſt 590: for 47 × 4 = 188 − 777, remains 580 + 1=590. This was 54 years before <hi>Theſpis</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented

                                 <p>From this paſſage it is plain, that the <hi>Elikia</hi> of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is not meant of his nativity, but of the beginning of his reign, when he was 33 years of age.</p>
                                 <p>It is then very ſurpriſing that <hi>Dodwell</hi> ſhould inſiſt upon it, that <hi>Elikia</hi> always ſignifies <hi>nativity.</hi> It is the more wonderful, as <hi>Dodwell</hi> quotes this paſſage from <hi>Clement;</hi> and as it is impoſſible to make out 610,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0028500202:282"/>without coming to the 33d of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as I have rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned it.</p>
                                 <p>Nay, in another place of the <hi>Stromata, Clement</hi> ſays, <hi>Iſaiah, Hoſea,</hi> and <hi>Micah</hi> lived after the <hi>Elikia</hi> of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus;</hi> where he can only mean the time when that lawgiver flouriſhed; for, from the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi> to the <hi>Akmé</hi> of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> was 290 years: and from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Troy</hi> was taken, to the time of the prophets, was 360 years.</p>
                                 <p>Thus does learning accommodate things. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> wanted to fit a paſſage in <hi>Antilochus</hi> to his own calculation, and ſo 312 years from the <hi>Elikia</hi> of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> that is, ſays <hi>Dodwell,</hi> from the <hi>nativity</hi> of the philoſopher (he meant taking the word in that ſenſe) to the death of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> brings us exactly to the time. Who can forbear ſmiling? A favourite notion is to many learned men a ſacred thing. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> ſettles his paſſage in <hi>Antilochus</hi> to his mind, by perverting the word <hi>Elikia.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>This, to be ſure, in prophane things, can do no great harm: but when the practice is brought into things ſacred, it is a detriment to mankind. Some divines, for example, to ſupport a notion as unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as it is dear to them, tell us that the word <hi>Iſos</hi> ſignifies <hi>ſtrict equality,</hi> not <hi>like:</hi> and that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays <gap reason="foreign">
                                       <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                    </gap>, we muſt conſtrue it, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was <hi>ſtrictly equal</hi> to the moſt high God. This is ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, when <hi>Homer, Euripides, Aeſchylus,</hi> make the word <hi>Iſos</hi> to import no more than <hi>like. Iſanemos,</hi> ſwift <hi>as</hi> the wind; <hi>Iſatheos phos, like</hi> a God; <hi>Iſanerios, like</hi> a dream.</p>
                                 <p>And when a divine is poſitive that <hi>os</hi> and <hi>kathos, as,</hi> and <hi>even as,</hi> words occurring in the New Teſtament,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0028500202:283"/>ſignify a <hi>ſtrict equality,</hi> and not <hi>ſome ſort of likeneſs;</hi> this is miſerable perverſion, and hurts the chriſtian religion very greatly; as they endeavour, by ſuch a <hi>given ſenſe,</hi> to prove that the man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is to be <hi>honoured</hi> with the <hi>ſame divine honours</hi> we offer to <hi>God the Father Almighty,</hi> by the <hi>command</hi> and <hi>example</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was <hi>ſent from God,</hi> and was a <hi>worſhipper of God;</hi> who lived <hi>obedient</hi> to the <hi>laws</hi> of <hi>God, preached thoſe laws,</hi> and <hi>died</hi> for them in the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> who was <hi>raiſed</hi> from the <hi>dead by God,</hi> and now fits on <hi>God's right hand; intercedes</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and in his Goſpel owns <hi>his Father</hi> to be <hi>his</hi> and <hi>our only true God.</hi> This is ſad accommodation. Tho' the words never ſignify more than a <hi>degree of likeneſs</hi> in the <hi>Greek claſſics,</hi> yet our headſtrong orthodox monks will have them to mean <hi>ſtrict equality;</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copperſmith are the ſame Being.

When I came to Miſs <hi>Spence</hi>'s door, I ſent in my name by a ſervant, and immediately <hi>Maria</hi> came out herſelf to welcome me to <hi>Cleator.</hi> She told me ſhe was glad to ſee me, and extremely obliged to me, for rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many miles out of my way, to travel up with her to <hi>London;</hi> but as ſhe had never been further from home than <hi>Harro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and was afraid of going ſuch a journey by herſelf, ſhe writ to me, in hopes curioſity and my great complaiſance to the ladies, might induce me to take <hi>Cleator</hi> in my way to town, tho' ſo much about: but as ſo many weeks had paſſed ſince ſhe came away from the <hi>Wells,</hi> and ſhe heard nothing of me, ſhe had laid aſide all expectation of my coming. This made the viſit the more pleaſing.</p>

In anſwer to this, I replied, that if I had got her letter ſooner, I would have been with her long before: but that was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as I had been at a little lodge and farm of mine in the northern extremity of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland,</hi> to ſettle things there, and returned
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0028500202:278"/>to <hi>Harrogate</hi> but yeſterday, when I had the honour of receiving your letter, and upon reading it, ſet out at day-break this morning to kiſs your hand, and execute any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0028500202:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>me in the north, nor ſeen me at <hi>Harrogate</hi> before the other day.</p>
               <p>I told her I was a ſtranger in the county, and by a wonderful accident, as I travelled a
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0028500202:281"/>few years ago out of curioſity, and in ſearch of a friend, up <hi>Stanemore-hills,</hi> I became poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a lodge I had on the northern edge
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0028500202:282"/>of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> where I lived a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, and once imagined I ſhould never leave it, as it is the moſt romantic and the moſt beautiful ſolitude in the world.</p>

                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0028500202:283"/>
While I was giving this ſhort relation, Miſs <hi>Spence</hi> ſeemed greatly amazed, and her uncle, an old clergyman, who had looked with great attention at me, hoped it would be no offence to aſk me how old I was.</p>
               <p>None at all, Sir, I replied. I want ſome months of twenty-ſix; and though I dance and rattle at the wells, and am now going up to <hi>London,</hi> where all is tumult and noiſe,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0028500202:284"/>yet my paſſion for ſtill life is ſo great, that I prefer the moſt ſilent retreat to the pleaſures and ſplendors of the greateſt town. If it was in my power to live as I pleaſe, I would paſs my days unheard of and unknown, at <hi>Orton-Lodge,</hi> ſo my little ſilent farm is called, near the ſouthern confines of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> with ſome bright partner of my ſoul. I am ſure I ſhould think it a compleat paradiſe to live in that diſtant ſolitude with a woman of Miſs <hi>Spence</hi>'s <hi>form</hi> and <hi>mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tell me, I requeſt, <hi>Maria</hi> ſaid, how did you get to the confines of <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> over <hi>Stanemore</hi> hills, and what was that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that put you in poſſeſſion of <hi>Orton-Lodge?</hi> It muſt be a curious account, I am ſure.</p>
               <p>This, I replied, you ſhall hear to-morrow morning after breakfaſt; there is not time for it now. All I can ſay at preſent is, that it was love kept me among the mountains for ſome years, and if the heaven-born maid (vaſtly like you, Miſs <hi>Spence,</hi> ſhe was) had not, by the order of heaven, been removed to the regions of immortality and day, I ſhould not have left the ſolitude, nor would you ever have left the ſolitude, nor would you ever have ſeen me at <hi>Harrogate:</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny is the dirigent: mutable is the condition of mortals, and we are blind to futurity and the approaches of fate. This led me over the vaſt mountains of <hi>Stanemore,</hi> enabled me
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0028500202:285"/>to croſs the amazing fells of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> and brought me to that ſpot, where I had the honour and happineſs of becoming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Miſs <hi>Spence.</hi> Thus did we chat till eleven, and retired to our chambers.</p>
               <p>But the old gentleman, the doctor, when he came with me into my apartment, told me we muſt have one bottle more, for it was his nightcap, without which he could not ſleep: he then bid the ſervant make haſte with it, and when that was out, we had another. He was a ſenſible agreeable man, and pleaſed me very much, as he appeared a zealous friend to the illuſtrious houſe of <hi>Hanover;</hi> whereas almoſt all the clergymen I had been in company with ſince I came to <hi>England,</hi> were Jacobites, and very violent ones.</p>

To this the doctor replied, that the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a popiſh prince muſt be lawful, if we ought to ſecure our property and religion, and, as in duty bound, oppoſe his trampling upon the laws, and his own ſolemn declarations. If the people have privileges and intereſts, they may defend them, and as juſtifiably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe notorious domeſtic oppreſſions, as foreign invaſions. The head of the community, has no more a licence to deſtroy the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous intereſts of it, than any of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior members, or than any foreign invader. If a king has no paſſion to indulge, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the welfare of his people, then, as protection and obedience are reciprocal, and cannot ſubſiſt, the one without the other, it muſt be a crime in the people not to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and obey, and aſſiſt the royal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It is not only the intereſt but the duty of the ſubject to obey the prince, who is true to the important truſt repoſed in him, and has the welfare of the people at heart. But ſuch a king cannot be a papiſt. The Romiſh prince will not only ſtretch a limited preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into lawleſs power, and graſp at abſolute monarchy; but will break through the moſt ſacred ties, and ſubvert the rights he was ſworn to guard, to re-eſtabliſh <hi>popery</hi> in this kingdom. Could <hi>James</hi> the Second have kept the ſeat of government, and baffled all oppoſition, we may conclude from what he
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0028500202:287"/>did, from his trampling upon the laws, and his own ſolemn declarations; from his new court of <hi>inquiſition</hi> (the high commiſſion court) to ſubvert the conſtitution of the church of <hi>England,</hi> and to lay waſte all its fences againſt popery; from that furious act of his power, which fell on <hi>Magdalen-college,</hi> and his <hi>two cruel acts of parliament</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (<hi>repeal of the act of ſettlement,</hi> by which the proteſtant gentlemen were deprived of their eſtates; and the <hi>act of attainder,</hi> by which they were to be hanged, for going to beg their bread in another country, after they had been robbed of all in their own by their king, who had ſworn to protect them); from hence, I ſay, it is plain, that if <hi>James</hi> could have ſat firm upon the throne, his miſguided con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would have induced him to the moſt inhuman acts of violence. He would have proceeded to the barbarities; and rekindled the flames of <hi>Mary.</hi> Had he continued to reign over theſe kingdoms, it is moſt certain, that inſtruction and perſuaſion only would not have been the thing, but where inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perſuaſion failed, impriſonments, tortures, death, would have been uſed, to compel us to believe all the <hi>groſs abſurdities</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> their <hi>impieties</hi> go <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> to <hi>common ſenſe.</hi> We muſt throw away our reaſon and our bibles, the nobleſt gifts of heaven, and neither think nor ſpeak,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0028500202:288"/>but as we are bid by men no wiſer than our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or, we muſt expire under torments as great as the devil and the monks could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe. It was therefore neceſſary, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our church and ſtate, to exclude <hi>James</hi> and his popiſh heirs. The common welfare required this ſalutary precaution. The collected intereſt of the community is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary end of every law.</p>
               <p>All this, I ſaid, ſeems quite right. To be ſure, during that ſhort twilight of power, which dawned upon <hi>popery</hi> in <hi>England</hi> in the years 1689 and 90, its rage was imprudent. It did diſcover its fury and reſentment. In one of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> acts you have mentioned, more than 2000 people were attainted, and ſome of them the moſt noble and venerable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Yet had ſucceſs attended the arms of <hi>James,</hi> this would have been but the beginning of ſorrows. And probably a ſon of chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> would have proſcribed more in theſe two iſlands, than in heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> out of the whole vaſt <hi>Roman</hi> empire, were given up to deſtruction for their virtue, by the cruel triumvirate, <hi>Auguſtus, Antony,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus:</hi> And of conſequence, ſince dear experience convinced, it was equally abſurd and vain, to imagine that a popiſh head would govern a proteſtant church by any councils, but thoſe of <hi>popiſh prieſts,</hi> as it was to imagine that a popiſh king
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0028500202:289"/>would govern a proteſtant ſtate by any councils, but thoſe of <hi>popiſh counſellors;</hi> it muſt therefore be owned, that the Lords, and others, aſſembled at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> were juſt in declaring, <hi>that King James's admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations were uſurpations on the conſtitution; and that they owned it rebellion to reſiſt a king that governed by law; but to reſiſt a tyrant, who made his will his law, was nothing but a neceſſary defence.</hi> This, to be ſure, is juſt. But ſtill, if crowns are hereditary, and one ſevere puniſhment of treaſon was intended to check all rebellion, were we not a little too haſty in the affair of the Revolution? And might we not have expected ſomething better from the good ſenſe and good nature of <hi>James,</hi> if we had waited a while, till he could ſee the folly of his proceedings?</p>
               <p>To this the Doctor replied, that as to <hi>James</hi>'s good ſenſe, it never appeared he had any: and in reſpect of his many real good qualities, they were extinguiſhed by his bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry, and could never be of ſervice to a proteſtant ſpirit, the ſpirit of freemen: it was therefore incumbent on them, who knew and loved the invaluable bleſſings they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, to act as they did; that is, as the wiſdom of our conſtitution requires in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>As to the crown's being hereditary,—and the ſevere puniſhment of treaſons; — in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0028500202:290"/>of the firſt particular, there is no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or divine law declares crowns heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. If a certain rule of ſucceſſion has been eſtabliſhed in moſt kingdoms, the ſingle point of view in it was public good, or a prevention of thoſe inteſtine commotions, which might attend an election: But as every rule is diſpenſible, and muſt give way when it defeats the end for which it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; ſhould the cuſtomary ſucceſſion in a kingdom prove at any time productive of much greater evils than thoſe it was intended to obviate, it may queſtionleſs be ſuperſeded occaſionally. This point is evident from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Though the crown in our own country is generally hereditary, yet that right is to be ſet aſide, if the ſecurity of our civil and religious liberty requires it. If the <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>James</hi> was a right to <hi>dominion,</hi> in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only to the ſenſe of the <hi>legiſlature,</hi> but to that of the nation, then the <hi>popiſh prince was juſtly excluded,</hi> for denying the public good to be the ſupreme law. Had the right he claimed been eſtabliſhed, then our religion, our liberties, and the ſafety of our fortunes, had been no longer our own. In caſe of ſuch eſtabliſhment, the glory of our conſtitution was no more. The ſum of the matter is, the royal family of the <hi>Steuarts</hi> being <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> makes their caſe ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to an extinction of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0028500202:291"/>
And as to the accumulated puniſhment of treaſon in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that can only be deſigned as a powerful check to rebellion, againſt a king whoſe darling view is the welfare of the people. No infamy, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, or death, can be too ſevere for the man, who rebels againſt a prince that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns for the good of the people, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to tranſmit our ſtate ſafe to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. To plot againſt ſuch a ſovereign is a great crime indeed. To conſpire againſt a prince, whoſe life is of the utmoſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the community, is an enormity that ought to be ſtamped with a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, and puniſhed in the ſevereſt manner. But it can be no treaſon to act againſt a <hi>papiſt,</hi> who violates every maxim of our conſtitution, and by every maxim of popery labours to deſtroy our religion and liberties. Every man may repel unlawful attempts upon his perſon and property, and is armed by God with authority for ſelf-defence.</p>
               <p>To this it was replied, that I thought the Doctor quite right, and for my own part was determined to oppoſe a <hi>popiſh prince,</hi> whenever he comes on with his <hi>unalienable</hi> and <hi>indefeaſible</hi> claim, to introduce his <hi>abſurd and cruel religion,</hi> to deprive us of our <hi>rational chriſtianity,</hi> and make us <hi>ſlaves,</hi> inſtead of <hi>free-born ſubjects.</hi> No <hi>popiſh James,</hi> to write our themes, but (filling a bumper) may this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0028500202:292"/>nation be ever happy in a king whoſe right is founded upon law, and who has made it the rule of his government. May <hi>Britons</hi> ever remember the <hi>mercileſs rage of popery,</hi> and the <hi>envious malice of France;</hi> each ready to lay waſte the whole fabric of our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſtitution, and cry aloud, with all the embittered ſons of <hi>Edom, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.</hi> — Here the clock ſtruck one, and we parted.</p>

                  </note>§. 4. Early the next morning I was up, according to my wont, and walked out, to look at the place. <hi>Cleator</hi> is one of the fineſt ſpots that can be ſeen; in a wild romantic country. The natural views are wonderful, and afford the eye vaſt pleaſure. The charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſpects of different kinds, from the edges of the mountains, are very fine:—The wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hills, pretty plains, vaſt precipices, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woods, deep vales, the eaſy falls of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſome places, and in others cataracts tumbling over rocks, — form all together the moſt beautiful and delightful ſcenes.

                  </note>§. 5. This was Miſs <hi>Spence</hi>'s country-houſe. Here the wiſe and excellent <hi>Maria</hi> paſs'd the beſt part of her time, and never went to any public place but <hi>Harrogate</hi> once a year. In reading, riding, fiſhing, and ſome viſits to and from three or four neighbours now and then, her hours were happily and uſefully employed. Hiſtory and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics ſhe took great delight in, and had a very ſurpriſing knowledge in the laſt. She was another of thoſe ladies I met with in my travels, who underſtood that method of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, beyond which nothing further is to be hoped or expected; I mean the <hi>arithmetic of fluxions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very few men among the learned can conſider magnitudes as generated by motion, or determine their proportions one to another from the celerities of the motion by which they are generated. I queſtion if the <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reviewers</hi> can do it (I am ſure they cannot), though they have made ſo licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly free with me. They may however pretend to know ſomething of the matter, and ſo did <hi>Berkley,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Cloyne</hi> in <hi>Ireland:</hi> yet that prelate, in reality, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0028500202:294"/>no more of the method than a porter does, though he preſumed to write againſt it, and the divine <hi>Newton,</hi> the inventor of it: I ſay it. But <hi>Maria Spence,</hi> in the 24th year of her age (at this time), was a maſter in the fluxionary way. She had not only a clear and adequate notion of fluxions, but was able to penetrate into the depths of this ſcience, and had made ſublime diſcoveries in this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable method of reaſoning. She aſtoniſhed me. I thought Mrs. <hi>Burcott</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Flet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> (mentioned in my firſt volume, p. 275.) were very extraordinary women, on account of their knowledge in algebra, and the ſine anſwers they gave to the moſt difficult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems in univerſal arithmetic: but this ſort of reaſoning is far inferior to the fluxionary method of calculation; as the latter opens and diſcovers to us the ſecrets and receſſes of nature, which have always before been locked up in obſcurity and darkneſs. By fluxions, ſuch difficulties are reſolved, as raiſe the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſurpriſe of all mankind, and which would in vain be attempted by any other method whatſoever. What then muſt we think of a young woman well ſkilled in ſuch work; — not only able to find the <hi>fluxions</hi> of flowing or determinate quantities, that is, the velocities with which they ariſe or begin to be generated in the firſt moments of formation (called the velocities of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremental
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0028500202:295"/>parts), and the velocities in the laſt ratio's, as vaniſhing or ceaſing to be; but from given fluxions to find the fluents; — and be ready in drawing tangents to curves; in the ſolution of problems <hi>de maximis &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimis,</hi> that is, the greateſt or leaſt poſſible quantity attainable in any caſe; in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of points of inflection and retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; in finding the <hi>evoluta</hi> of a given curve; in finding the cauſtic curves, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection and refraction, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> — this was amazing beyond any thing I had ſeen; or did ever ſee ſince, except Mrs. <hi>Benlow</hi> of <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> with whom I became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in 1739. (See <hi>Memoirs of ſeveral Ladies of Great Britain,</hi> Vol. I.) With aſtoniſhment I beheld her. I was but a young beginner, or learner, in reſpect of her, though I had applied ſo cloſe to <hi>fluxions</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had learned <hi>algebra</hi>), that my head was often ready to ſplit with pain; nor had I the capacity, at that time, to comprehend thoroughly the proceſs of ſeveral operations ſhe performed with beauty, ſimplicity, and charming elegance. Admirable <hi>Maria!</hi> No one have I ever ſeen that was her ſuperior in this ſcience: one equal only have I known, the lady a little before mentioned. And does not this demonſtrate, that the faculties and imagination of women's minds, properly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, may equal thoſe of the greateſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0028500202:296"/>men?<note place="margin">A reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the education of the women.</note> And ſince women have the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable minds as the male part of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, why ſhould they not be cultivated by the ſame method? Why ſhould reaſon be left to itſelf in one of the ſexes, and be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined with ſo much care in the other. Learning and knowledge are perfections in us not as we are men, but as we are rational creatures, in which order of beings the female world is upon the ſame level with the male. We ought to conſider in this particular, not what is the ſex, but what is the ſpecies they belong to. And if women of fortune were ſo conſidered, and educated accordingly, I am ſure the world would ſoon be the better for it. It would be ſo far from making them thoſe ridiculous mortals <hi>Moliere</hi> has deſcribed under the character of <hi>learned ladies;</hi> that it would render them more agreeable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and enable them by the acquiſition of true ſenſe and knowledge, to be ſuperior to <hi>gayety</hi> and <hi>ſpectacle, dreſs</hi> and <hi>diſſipation.</hi> They would ſee that the <hi>ſovereign good</hi> can be placed in nothing elſe but in <hi>rectitude of conduct;</hi> as that is agreeable to our nature; conducive to well-being; accommodate to all places and times; durable, ſelf-derived, indeprivable; and of conſequence, that on rational and maſculine religion only they can reſt the ſoal of the foot, and the ſooner they turn to it, the happier here and hereafter they ſhall be.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0028500202:297"/>Long before the <hi>power of ſenſe,</hi> like the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſun, is gradually forſaking them, (that <hi>power</hi> on which the pleaſures of the world depend) they would, by their acquired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge, ſee the <hi>folly</hi> of <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and that they were born not only to <hi>virtue, friendſhip, honeſty,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> but to <hi>religion, piety, adoration,</hi> and a <hi>generous ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render</hi> of their <hi>minds</hi> to the ſupreme cauſe. They would be glorious creatures then. Every family would be happy.</p>
               <p>But as to Miſs <hi>Spence,</hi> this knowledge, with a faultleſs perſon, and a modeſty mor graceful than her exquiſite beauty, were not the things that principally charmed me: nor was it her converſation, than which nothing could be more lively and delightful: nor her fine fortune.

My companion was ſo agreeable, that had it been two thouſand miles from <hi>Cleator</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> inſtead of 272, I ſhould ſtill have thought it too ſhort. Her converſation was ſo various and fine, that no way could ſeem tireſome and tedious to him that travelled with her. Her notions and remarks were ever lively and inſtructive.

I will give an inſtance.</p>
               <p>§. 7. In riding over the mountains the firſt day, we miſſed the road in the evening, and inſtead of getting to a very good inn, where we intended to reſt, we were forced to ſtop at a poor little public houſe, and right glad to get in there, as the evening was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous and wet, dark and cold. Here we got ſome bacon and freſh egges for ſupper, and the ale was good, which amuſed us well enough till nine o'clock. We then propoſed to play at cribbage for an hour, and called for a pack
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0028500202:299"/>of cards; but they had none in the houſe, and we were obliged to divert ourſelves with converſation, till it was time to retire. Miſs <hi>Spence</hi> began in the following manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on fluxions.</note>Was <hi>Newton,</hi> Sir, or <hi>Leibnitz,</hi> the author of that method of calculation, which lends its aid and aſſiſtance to all the other mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſciences, and that in their greateſt wants and diſtreſſes? I have heard a foreigner affirm, that the <hi>German</hi> was the inventor of fluxions.</p>
               <p>That cannot be (I replied). In the year 1696, Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> received from Mr. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> a demonſtration of the rule of the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature of curves,</hi> which the Doctor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Mr. <hi>Collins;</hi> and as this is the foundation of <hi>fluxions,</hi> and the <hi>differential calculus,</hi> it is evident Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the method before that time.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the year 1673, <hi>Leibnitz</hi> was in <hi>England,</hi> again in <hi>October</hi> 1676; and the interval of this time he ſpent in <hi>France,</hi> during which he kept a correſpondence with <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> and by his means with <hi>J. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins;</hi> and ſometimes alſo with <hi>Newton,</hi> from the laſt of whom he received a letter, dated <hi>June</hi> 18, 1676, wherein is taught the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of reducing quantities into infinite ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that is, of exhibiting the increments of flowing quantities. This method was utterly
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0028500202:300"/>unknown to <hi>Leibnitz,</hi> before he received the aboveſaid letter of <hi>Newton</hi>'s, as he himſelf acknowledges in a letter to <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 27, 1676; for before that time, he ſays in his letter, he was obliged to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an irrational quantity into a rational fraction, and then by diviſion, after the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>Mercator,</hi> to reduce the fraction into a ſeries.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe certain, that <hi>Leibnitz</hi> did not then underſtand theſe ſeries, becauſe, in the ſame letter, he deſires <hi>Newton</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to him the manner how he got theſe ſeries. And again in a ſecond letter from <hi>Newton</hi> to <hi>Leibnitz,</hi> dated <hi>October</hi> 24, 1676, he gives yet clearer hints of his method, and illuſtrates it by examples, and lays down a rule, by which, from the ordinates of certain curves, their areas may be obtained in finite terms, when it is poſſible.</p>
               <p>By theſe lights, and aſſiſted by ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, the acute <hi>Leibnitz</hi> might have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Newtonian</hi> method.</p>
               <p>It is plain he did ſo; for in 1684, he firſt publiſhed, in the <hi>Leipſic Acts,</hi> his <hi>Elements of the Differential Calculus,</hi> without pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have had the method before the year 1677, the year he received the two letters from <hi>Newton:</hi> and yet, when Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his books of the number of curves of the firſt kind, and of the quadrature of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0028500202:301"/>the editors of the <hi>Acts</hi> ſaid <hi>Leibnitz</hi> was the firſt inventor of the <hi>differential cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> and <hi>Newton</hi> had ſubſtituted <hi>fluxions</hi> for <hi>differences,</hi> juſt as <hi>Honoratus Faber,</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis Geometrica,</hi> had ſubſtituted a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of motion for <hi>Cavallerius</hi>'s method of indiviſibles; that is, <hi>Leibnitz</hi> was the firſt inventor of the method, <hi>Newton</hi> had received it from him (from his <hi>Elements of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential Calculus),</hi> and had ſubſtituted <hi>fluxions</hi> for <hi>differences;</hi> but the way of inveſtigation in each is the ſame, and both center in the ſame concluſions.</p>
               <p>This excited Mr. <hi>Keil</hi> to reply; and he made it appear very plain from Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s letters, publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> that he <hi>(Newton)</hi> was the firſt inventor of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorith, or practical rules of fluxions; and <hi>Leibnitz</hi> did no more than publiſh the ſame, with an alteration of the name, and manner of notation. This however did not ſilence <hi>Leibnitz,</hi> nor ſatisfy the foreigners who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired him. He abuſed Dr. <hi>Keil,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the Royal Society againſt him; that they would be pleaſed to reſtrain the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's vain babblings and unjuſt calumniations, and report their judgment as he thought they ought to do, that is, in his favour. But this was not in the power of the Society, if they did juſtice; for it appeared quite clear to a committee of the members, appointed
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0028500202:302"/>to examine the original letters, and other papers, relating to the matter, which were left by Mr. <hi>Oldenburgh</hi> and Mr. <hi>J. Collins,</hi> that Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> was the firſt <hi>inventor</hi> of <hi>fluxions;</hi> and accordingly they publiſhed their opinion. This determines the affair. When this is the caſe, it is ſenſeleſs for any foreigner to ſay <hi>Leibnitz</hi> was the author of fluxions. To the divine <hi>Newton</hi> belongs this greateſt work of genius, and the nobleſt thought that ever entered the human mind.</p>
               <p>It muſt be ſo (<hi>Maria</hi> replied): As the caſe is ſtated, Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> was moſt certainly the inventor of the method of fluxions: And ſuppoſing <hi>Leibnitz</hi> had been able to diſcover and work the <hi>differential cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> without the lights he received from <hi>Newton,</hi> it would not from thence follow, that he underſtood the true method of <hi>fluxions:</hi> for, though a <hi>differential</hi> has been, and to this day is, by many, called a <hi>fluxion,</hi> and a <hi>fluxion</hi> a <hi>differential,</hi> yet it is an abuſe of terms. A <hi>fluxion</hi> has no relation to a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential,</hi> nor a <hi>differential</hi> to a <hi>fluxion,</hi> The principles upon which the methods are founded ſhew them to be very different; notwithſtanding the way of inveſtigation in each be the ſame, and that both center in the ſame concluſions: nor can the <hi>differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> method perform what the <hi>fluxionary</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0028500202:303"/>method can. The excellency of the <hi>fluxion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> method is far above the <hi>differential.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This remark on the two methods ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me very much, and eſpecially as it was made by a young lady. I had not then a notion of the difference, and had been taught by my maſter to proceed on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Differential Calculus.</hi> This made me requeſt an explication of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Maria</hi> went on in the following manner.</p>
               <p>Magnitudes, as made up of an infinite number of very ſmall conſtituent parts put together, are the work of the <hi>Differential Calculus;</hi> but by the <hi>fluxionary</hi> method, we are taught to conſider magnitudes as generated by motion. A deſcribed line in this way, is not generated by an <hi>appoſition</hi> of points, or <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entials,</hi> but by the <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>flux</hi> of a point; and the velocity of the generating point in the firſt moment of its formation, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, is called its fluxion. In forming magnitudes after the <hi>differential</hi> way, we conceive them as made up of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall conſtituent parts, ſo diſpoſed as to produce a magnitude of a given form; that theſe parts are to each other as the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes of which they are <hi>differentials;</hi> and that one infinitely ſmall part, or <hi>differential,</hi> muſt be infinitely great, with reſpect to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0028500202:304"/>other <hi>differential,</hi> or infinitely ſmall part: but by <hi>fluxion,</hi> or the law of <hi>flowing,</hi> we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the proportion of magnitudes one to another, from the celerities of the motions by which they are generated. This moſt certainly is the pureſt abſtracted way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. Our conſidering the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of magnitude, as ariſing from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſeries of mutations of velocity, is much more ſimple, and leſs perplexed than the other way; and the operations founded on <hi>fluxions,</hi> muſt be much more clear, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and convincing, than thoſe that are founded on the <hi>Differential Calculus.</hi> There is a great difference in operations, when quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities are rejected, becauſe they really vaniſh; —and when they are rejected, becauſe they are infinitely ſmall: the latter method, which is the <hi>differential,</hi> muſt leave the mind in ambiguity and confuſion, and cannot in many caſes come up to the truth. It is a very great error then to call <hi>differentials, flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,</hi> and quite wrong to begin with the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferential</hi> method, in order to learn the law or manner of <hi>flowing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With amazement I heard his diſcourſe, and requeſted to know by what maſter, and what method, ſhe obtained theſe notions; for they were far beyond every thing on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that I had ever met with.

                  <note place="margin">An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Martin Murdoch.</hi>
                  </note>My maſter, Sir, (<hi>Maria</hi> anſwered) was a poor traveller, a Scotchman, one <hi>Martin Murdoch,</hi> who came by accident to my father's houſe, to aſk relief, when I was about fifteen years old. He told us, he was the ſon of one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the miniſters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and came from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt part of the Highlands: that his father taught him mathematics, and left him, at his death, a little ſtock on a ſmall farm; but misfortunes and accidents obliged him in a ſhort time to break up houſe, and he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>London,</hi> to try if he could get any thing there, by teaching arithmetic of every kind. My father, who was a hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, invited him to ſtay with us a few days, and the parſon of our pariſh ſoon found, that he had not only a very extraordinary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but was particularly excellent at figures, and the other branches of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics. My father upon this agreed with him to be my preceptor for five years, and during four years and nine months of that time, he took the greateſt pains to make me as perfect as he could in arithmetic, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonometry, geometry, algebra, and fluxions. As I delighted in the ſtudy above all things, I was a great proficient for ſo few years, and had <hi>Murdoch</hi> been longer with me, I ſhould
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0028500202:306"/>have been well acquainted with the whole glorious ſtructure: but towards the end of the fifth year, this poor <hi>Archimedes</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately drowned, in croſſing one of our rivers, in the winter time, and went in that uncomfortable way, in the thirty-ſixth year of his age, to the enjoyment of that felicity and glory, which God has prepared for a virtuous life and honeſt heart. Why ſuch men, as the poor and admirable <hi>Murdoch,</hi> have often ſuch hard meaſure in this world, is not in my power to account for; nor do I believe any one can: but what I tell you is one of thoſe ſurprizing things, and I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented not a little the loſs of ſuch a maſter. Still however I continued to ſtudy by many written rules he had given me, and to this day, mathematics are the greateſt pleaſure of my life.</p>
               <p>As to our method, my maſter, in the firſt place, made me perfectly underſtand arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic, and then geometry and algebra, in all their parts and improvements, the methods of ſeries, doctrine of proportions, nature of loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithms, mechanics, and laws of motion: from thence we proceeded to the pure doctrine of <hi>fluxions,</hi> and at laſt looked into the <hi>Differential Calculus.</hi> In this true way my excellent maſter led me, and in the ſame difficult path every one muſt go, who intends to learn <hi>Fluxions.</hi> I would be but loſt labour for any perſon to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0028500202:307"/>attempt them, who was unacquainted with theſe <hi>Precognita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we turned to <hi>fluxions,</hi> the firſt thing my maſter did, was to inſtruct me in the arithmetic of <hi>exponents,</hi> the nature of powers, and the manner of their generation. We went next to the doctrine of infinite ſeries; and then, to the manner of generating <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical quantities.</hi> This generation of quantities was my firſt ſtep into <hi>fluxions,</hi> and my maſter ſo amply explained the nature of them, in this operation, that I was able to form a <hi>juſt idea</hi> of a <hi>firſt fluxion,</hi> though thought by many to be <hi>incomprehenſible.</hi> We proceeded from thence to the <hi>notation</hi> and <hi>algorithm</hi> of <hi>firſt fluxions;</hi> to the finding ſecond, third, <hi>&amp;c. fluxions;</hi> the finding <hi>flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions</hi> of <hi>exponential quantities;</hi> and the <hi>fluents</hi> from given <hi>fluxions;</hi> to their uſes in drawing <hi>tangents</hi> to <hi>curves;</hi> in finding the <hi>areas</hi> of <hi>ſpaces;</hi> the <hi>valves</hi> of <hi>ſurfaces;</hi> and the <hi>contents</hi> of <hi>ſolids;</hi> their <hi>percuſſion, oſcillation,</hi> and <hi>centers of gravity.</hi> All theſe things my maſter ſo happily explained to my underſtanding, that I was able to work with eaſe, and found no more difficulty in conceiving an adequate notion of a <hi>naſcent</hi> or <hi>evaneſcent quantity,</hi> than in forming a true idea of a <hi>mathematical point.</hi> In ſhort, by the time I had ſtudied fluxions two years, I not only underſtood their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principles and operations, and could inveſtigate, and give the ſolution of the moſt
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0028500202:308"/>general and uſeful problems in the mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics; but likewiſe, ſolve ſeveral problems that occur in the phaenomena of nature.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Maria</hi> ſtopped, and as ſoon as aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment would permit me to ſpeak, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to her ſeveral difficult queſtions, I had heard, but was not then able to anſwer. I requeſted her, in the firſt place, to inform me, how the time of a body's deſcending through any arch of a cycloid was found: and if ten hundred weight avoirdupoiſe, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a bar of ſteel perfectly elaſtic, and ſupported at both ends, will juſt break the bar, what muſt be the weight of a globe, falling perpendicular 185 feet on the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the bar, to have the ſame effect? — My next queſtions were, how long, and how far, ought a given globe to deſcend by its comparative weight in a medium of a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven denſity, but without reſiſtance, to acquire the greateſt velocity it is capable of in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending with the ſame weight, and in the ſame medium, with reſiſtance? — And how are we to find the value of a ſolid formed by the rotation of this curvilinear ſpace, A C D about the axis A D, the general equation, expreſſing the nature of the curve, being <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>— How is the center of gravity to be found of the ſpace encloſed
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0028500202:309"/>by an hyperbola, and its aſymptete? And how are we to find the center of oſcillation of a ſphere revolving about the line P A M, a tangent, to the generating circle F A H, in the point A, as an axis?—Theſe queſtions <hi>Maria</hi> anſwered with a celerity and elegance that again amazed me, and convinced me that, notwithſtanding the <hi>Right Rev. meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical diſputant,</hi> Dr. <hi>Berkley,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Cloyne</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> could not underſtand the doctrine of fluxions, and therefore did all he could to diſgrace them, and the few ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians who have ſtudied magnitudes as generated by motion; yet, the doctrine, as delivered by the divine <hi>Newton,</hi> may be clearly conceived, and diſtinctly comprehended; that the principles upon which it is founded, are <hi>true,</hi> and the demonſtrations of its rules <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive.</hi> No oppoſition can hurt it.</p>
               <p>When I obſerved, that ſome learned men will not allow that a velocity which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues for no time at all, can poſſibly deſcribe any ſpace at all: its effect, they ſay, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely nothing, and inſtead of ſatisfying rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with truth and preciſion, the human faculties are quite confounded, loſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered in fluxions. A velocity or fluxion is at beſt we do not know what;—whether ſomething or nothing: and how can the mind lay hold on, or form any accurate abſtract idea of ſuch a ſubtile, fleeting thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0028500202:310"/>
Diſputants (<hi>Maria</hi> anſwered) may perplex with deep ſpeculations, and confound with myſterious diſquiſitions, but the method of fluxions has no dependance on ſuch things. The operation is not what any ſingle abſtract velocity can generate or deſcribe of itſelf, but what a continual and ſucceſſively variable velocity can produce in the whole: And certainly, a variable cauſe may produce a variable effect, as well as a permanent cauſe a permanent and conſtant effect. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference can only be, that the continual vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the effect muſt be proportional to the continual variation of the cauſe. The method of <hi>fluxions</hi> therefore is true, whether we can or cannot conceive the nature and manner of ſeveral things relating to them, though we had no ideas of perpetually ariſing increments, and magnitudes in naſcent or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſcent ſtates. The knowledge of ſuch things is not eſſential to fluxions. All they propoſe is, <hi>to determine the velocity or flowing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a generated quantity increaſes, and to ſum up all that has been generated or deſcribed by the continually variable fluxion.</hi> On theſe two baſes fluxions ſtand.</p>
               <p>This was clear and juſt, and ſhewed that the nature and idea of <hi>fluxions</hi> is agreeable to the nature and conſtitution of things. They can have no dependance upon any <hi>metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical ſpeculations,</hi> (ſuch ſpeculations as that
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0028500202:311"/>
                  <hi>anti-mathematician,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Cloyne,</hi> brought in, to cavil and diſpute againſt principles he underſtood nothing of, and <hi>maliciouſly</hi> run the account of them into the dark;) but are the genuine offspring of nature and truth. An inſtance or two may illuſtrate the matter.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A heavy body deſcends perpendicularly 16 1/12 feet in a ſecond, and at the end of this time, has acquired a velocity of 32⅙ feet in a ſecond, which is accurately known. At any given diſtance then from the place the body fell, take the point A in the right line, and the velocity of the falling body in the point may be truly computed: but the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in any point above A, at ever ſo ſmall a diſtance, will be leſs than in A; and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity at any point below A, at the leaſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diſtance, will be greater than in A. It is therefore plain, that in the point A, the body has a certain determined velocity, which belongs to no other point in the whole line. Now this velocity is the fluxion of that right line in the point A; and with it the body would proceed, if gravity acted no longer on the body's arrival at A.</item>
                  <item>2. Take a glaſs tube open at both ends, whoſe concavity is of different diameters in different places, and immerſe it in a ſtream, till the water fills the tube, and flows through it. Then, in different parts of the tube, the velocity of the water will be as the ſquares
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0028500202:312"/>of the diameters, and of conſequence dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Suppoſe then, in any marked place, a plane to paſs through the tube perpendicular to the axis, or to the motion of the water, and of conſequence, the water will paſs through this ſection with a certain determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate velocity: But if another ſection be drawn ever ſo near the former, the water, by reaſon of the different diameters, will flow through this with a velocity different from what it did at the former, and therefore to one ſection of the tube, or ſingle point only, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate velocity belongs. It is the fluxion of the ſpace which the fluid deſcribes at that ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and with that uniform velocity the fluid would continue to move, if the diameter was the ſame to the end of the tube.</item>
                  <item>3. If a hollow cylinder be filled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to flow freely out through a hole at the bottom, the velocity of the effluent will be as the height of the water, and ſince the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the incubent fluid deſcends without ſtop, the velocity of the ſtream will decreaſe, till the effluent be all out. There can then be no two moments of time, ſucceeding each other ever ſo nearly, wherein the velocity of the water is the ſame; and of conſequence, the velocity, at any given point, belongs only to that particular indiviſible moment of time. Now this is accurately the fluxion of the fluid then flowing; and if, at that inſtant, more
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0028500202:313"/>water was poured into the cylinder, to make the ſurface keep its place, the effluent would retain its velocity, and ſtill be the fluxion of the fluid. Such are the operations of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and they viſibly confirm the nature of <hi>Fluxion.</hi> It is from hence quite clear, that the <hi>fluxion</hi> of a <hi>generated quantity,</hi> cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any one determined value for the leaſt ſpace of time whatever, but the moment it arrives at that value, the ſame moment it loſes it again. The <hi>fluxion</hi> of ſuch quantity can only paſs gradually and ſucceſſively thro' the indefinite degrees contained between the two extreme values, which are the limits thereof, during the generation of the fluent, in caſe the fluxion be variable: But then, though a determinate degree of fluxion does not continue at all, yet, at every determinate indiviſible moment of time, every fluent has ſome determinate degree of fluxion; that is, every <hi>generated quantity</hi> has every where a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>rate</hi> of increaſing, a <hi>fluxion</hi> whoſe abſtract value is determinate in itſelf, though the <hi>fluxion</hi> has no determined value for the leaſt ſpace of time whatever. To find its value then, that is, the <hi>ratio</hi> one fluxion has to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is a <hi>problem ſtrictly geometrical;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Right Rev. anti-mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician has declared the contrary, in his hatred to mathematicians, and his ignorance of the true principles of mathematics.</item>

If my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Cloyne</hi> had been qualified to examine and conſider the <hi>caſe</hi> of <hi>fluxions,</hi> and could have laid aſide that unaccountable obſtinacy, and invincible prejudice, which made him reſolve to yield to no reaſon on the ſubject;—not to regard even the great <hi>Maclaurin</hi>'s anſwer to his <hi>Analyſt;</hi> — he would have diſcovered, that it was very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to find the <hi>abſtract value</hi> of a <hi>generated quantity,</hi> or the <hi>contemporary increment</hi> of any <hi>compound quantity.</hi> By the binomial theorem, the ratio of the fluxion of a ſimple quantity to the fluxion of that compound quantity, may be had in general, in the loweſt terms, and as near the truth as we pleaſe, whilſt we ſuppoſe ſome very ſmall increment actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſcribed: And whereas the ratio of theſe fluxions is required for ſome one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible point of the fluid, in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the increment, and before it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, we make, in the particular caſe, the values of the ſimple increments nothing, which before was expreſſed in general: then all the terms wherein they are found vaniſh, and what is left accurately ſhews the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fluxions for the point where the increment is ſuppoſed to commence. As the abſtract value of the fluxion belongs only to one point of the fluent, the moments are made to vaniſh, after we have ſeen by their continual diminution, whither the ratio tends,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0028500202:315"/>and what it continually verges to; and this becomes as viſible as the very character it is written in.</p>
               <p>But Dr. <hi>Berkley</hi> was unacquainted with mathematical principles, and out of his aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to theſe ſciences, and zeal for orthodoxy, cavilled and diſputed with all his might, and endeavoured to bring the matter to a ſtate unintelligible to himſelf, and every body elſe. —Here <hi>Maria</hi> had done, and for near a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour after, I ſat ſilently looking at her, in the greateſt aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>But as to our travels, the 10th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> we got ſafe to <hi>London,</hi> and the conſequence of the journey was, that the laſt day of the ſame month, I had the honour and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of being married to this young lady.</p>

The efferveſcence or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation was very ſoon ſo violent as to ſhew, that it not only endangered, but would quickly ſubvert the animal fabrick, unleſs the blood was ſpeedily diſperſed, and nature got the victory by an excluſion of the noxious ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in particles.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0028500202:319"/>woman would ſink under the conflict. To ſave her, if poſſible, I ſent immediately for a great phyſician, Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> a man who talked with great fluency of medicine and diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>This gentleman told me, the <hi>Alkaline</hi> was the root of fevers, as well as of other diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and therefore, to take off the efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the blood in the ebullitions of it, to incide the viſcous humour, to drain the tartarous ſalts from the kidnies, to allay the preternatural ferment, and to brace up the relaxed tones, he ordered orange and vinegar in whey, and preſcribed ſpirit of ſulphur, and vitriol, the cream, chryſtals, and vitriolate tartar in other vehicles. If any thing can relieve, it muſt be plenty of acid. <hi>In acidis poſita eſt omni curatio.</hi> But theſe things gave no relief to the ſufferer.</p>
               <p>I ſent then in all haſte for Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> a man of great reputation, and he differed ſo much in opinion from <hi>Sharp,</hi> that he called an <hi>acid</hi> the <hi>chief enemy.</hi> It keeps up the <hi>luctus</hi> or ſtruggle, and if not expelled very quickly, will certainly prove fatal.

               <p>Dr. <hi>Pym</hi> was next called in, a great practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and learned man. His notion of a fever was quite different from the opinions of <hi>Sharp</hi> and <hi>Hough.</hi> He maintained that a <hi>fever</hi> was a <hi>poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous ferment</hi> or <hi>venom,</hi> which ſeized on the <hi>animal ſpirits:</hi> it breaks and ſmites them; and unleſs by <hi>alexipharmics</hi> the ſpirits can be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to gain a victory in a day or two, this <hi>ferment</hi> will bring on what the <hi>Greeks</hi> call a <hi>ſynochus,</hi> that is, a continual fever. In that ſtate, the <hi>venom</hi> holds faſt the animal ſpirits, will not let them expand, or diſengage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then they grow enraged, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuating, are hurried into a ſtate of explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and blow up the fabric. Hence the inflammatory fever, according to the diverſe <hi>indoles</hi> of the <hi>venom;</hi> and when the <hi>contagious miaſms</hi> arrive at their higheſt degree, the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever</hi> ariſeth. The ſpirits are then knocked down, and the marks of the enemies weapons, the ſpots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appear. This (the Doctor continued) is the caſe of your lady, and therefore the thing to be done is, to make the <hi>malignant</hi> tack about to the mild, and produce an extinction of the ferment, and relief of the ſymptoms. This I endeavour to do by <hi>alexipharmics</hi> and <hi>veſicatories,</hi> and by ſubduing the poiſon by the <hi>bark</hi> and the <hi>warmer antidotes.</hi> Thus did my Doctor mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0028500202:321"/>ſhal his <hi>animal ſpirits,</hi> fight them againſt the enemy <hi>venom,</hi> to great diſadvantage. If his talk was not romance, it was plain his <hi>ſpirits</hi> were routed, and <hi>venom</hi> was getting the day. His <hi>alexipharmics</hi> and <hi>warm antidotes,</hi> were good for nothing. The malady encreaſed.</p>
               <p>This being the caſe, I ſent again in haſte for a fourth doctor, a man of greater learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the other three, and therefore, in opinion, oppoſite, and againſt their manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fever. This great man was Dr. <hi>Froſt.</hi> He <hi>was</hi> a <hi>mechanician,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that, the ſolid parts of the human body are ſubjected to the rules of <hi>geometry,</hi> and the fluids to the <hi>hydroſtatics;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to keep the <hi>machine</hi> in right order, that is, in a ſtate of <hi>health,</hi> an <hi>aequilibrium</hi> muſt be maintained, or reſtored, if deſtroyed. The balance muſt not turn to one ſide or the other. To reſtore <hi>ſanity</hi> in acute caſes, and in chronic too, our buſineſs is to prevent the veſſels being elevated or depreſt beyond the <hi>ſtandard of nature:</hi> when either happens, the diviſion of the blood is increaſed, the motion is augmented, and ſo beget a fever. There cannot be an inordinate elevation of the oily or fiery parts of the blood, till the veſſels vibrate above the <hi>ſtandard of nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a ſlight <hi>fever,</hi> the blood increaſes but little above the <hi>balance;</hi> but if more than one day; turns to a <hi>ſynochus,</hi> which is but the ſame
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0028500202:322"/>fever augmented beyond the <hi>balance of nature.</hi> This turns to a putrid <hi>ſynochus,</hi> and this to a <hi>cauſus.</hi> This is the caſe of your lady. From an elevated contraction (the Doctor conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, to my amazement,) her blood obtains a greater force and motion; hence greater diviſion, hence an increaſe of quantity and fluidity: and thus from greater diviſion, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quantity increaſed, ariſes that heat and thirſt, with the other concomitant ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of her fever; for the blood dividing faſter than it can be detached through the perſpirastory emunctories of the ſkin, is the immediate cauſe of the heart's preternatural beating: And this preternatural diviſion of the blood ariſes from the additional quantity of obſtructed perſpirable matter, added to the natural quantity of the blood.</p>
               <p>Things being ſo, (the Doctor went on) and the fever riſing by the blood's dividing faſter than can be detached by the ſeveral emunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; and this from an elevation of the <hi>ſolids</hi> bove the <hi>balance,</hi> we muſt then ſtrive to take off the tenſion of the ſolids, and ſubtract the cauſe. This makes me begin in a manner quite contrary to the other phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and I doubt not but I ſhall ſoon get the better of the <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>orgaſm,</hi> make an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the black ſcabrous tongue, and by according with the <hi>modus of nature,</hi> throw forth the matter of the diſeaſe. I will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0028500202:323"/>nature to extricate herſelf. I hope to diſentangle her from the weight.</p>
               <p>Thus did this very learned man enlarge; and while he talked of doing wonders, the dry and parched ſkin, the black and bruſhy tongue, the cruſty fur upon the teeth, and all the ſignals of an <hi>incendium</hi> within, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her diſſolution very near. As the ſerum diminiſhed faſt, and the inteſtine motion of the <hi>craſſamentum</hi> increaſed, nature was brought to her laſt ſtruggles. All the diſmal harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a general wreck appeared, to give the by-ſtanders notice of approaching death. She died the ninth day, by the ignorance of four learned Phyſicians. — Had theſe Gentlemen confidered the <hi>fever</hi> no otherwiſe than as a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe</hi> ariſing from ſome unuſual <hi>ferment,</hi> ſtirred up among the humours of the blood, diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both thoſe natural motions and functions of the body, hindering perſpiration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by giving quick and large acceſſion to ſuch parts of the aliment or liquors taken down, as are diſpoſed to ferment; and there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a ſtrong diſpoſition that way; for the blood has a three-fold motion,—<hi>fluidity,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all liquors,—<hi>protruſive,</hi> from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of the heart and arteries,—and <hi>fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,</hi> that is, a motion throughout of all its parts, which quality is owing to the diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts of the blood; — for being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of various particles, there muſt be a
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0028500202:324"/>colluctation when they occur, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, a continual fermentation: As this is juſt and moderate, it is for the good of the animal, and purifies the blood: if it is too much, it tends to a fever; — if it ſtill increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it produces the <hi>burning cauſus:</hi> Hard is the ſtruggle then, and if <hi>nature</hi> cannot <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pume,</hi> even helped by art, the patient has no hazard for life: Hence it is, that we are ſo ſubject to fevers, — and that it carries away more people than all the reſt of the diſeaſes: Out of every forty-two that have it; twenty-five generally die. It was ſo in the time of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> 430 years before <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And ſo Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> and Dr. <hi>Friend</hi> found it, in their practice:</p>
               <p>But (I ſay) had my four Doctors conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>fever</hi> as I have plainly ſtated it, without vainly pretending to be ſo wiſe as to know the <hi>eſſential cauſes</hi> of it; and in the beginning of it, before the terrible appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, the <hi>vigil, delirium, ſubſultus,</hi> the dry black tongue, the furred teeth, and the pale, unconcocted urine, had cauſed a <hi>depletion</hi> by large bleeding, had opened the pores by a mild ſudorific, had then given a vomit, <hi>Rad. Ipecacuanha</hi> in ſmall ſack-whey or chicken-water, and let the ſufferer indulge in that thin diluting liquor, an emulſion of the ſeeds and almonds in barley water, and if the patient required it, a draught of table-beer with a
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0028500202:325"/>toaſt, between whiles; had this been done very ſoon, there might be relief as quickly; or if the fever ſtill run high, to bleed again, and waſh down ſome <hi>proper alexipharmic</hi> powder with a <hi>proper cordial</hi> julap, it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible nature would have been able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the work, and health had been again reſtored. I uſe the word <hi>proper</hi> alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic, and <hi>proper</hi> cordial julap, becauſe the <hi>Theriaca</hi> and <hi>Mithridatium</hi> of the ſhops, which are commonly, almoſt always ordered as an <hi>alexipharmic bole,</hi> are rather <hi>poiſons</hi> than uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a fever; and becauſe the <hi>tincture</hi> and <hi>ſyrup of ſaffron,</hi> the <hi>treacle-water,</hi> or any other diſtilled compound, are not fit <hi>cordials</hi> in the caſe; but it ſhould be the <hi>conſerva lujulae</hi> in an <hi>emulſion ex ſem. fr. cum amygd. in aq. hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei.</hi> This is the <hi>true alexipharmic,</hi>—and the <hi>only cordial,</hi> to be given in a <hi>fever.</hi> — But it was the deſtructive <hi>alexipharmics</hi> and <hi>cordials</hi> of the ſhops they forced down <hi>Maria</hi>'s throat, and this, with the other bad preſcriptions and management, killed one of the fineſt and moſt excellent women that ever lived.</p>
               <p>And now to give the world a better idea of this admirable woman than any deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine can exhibit, I ſhall here place a few religious little Pieces, which ſhe writ, while Miſs <hi>Spence,</hi> and which I found among her papers.</p>
               <div type="essay">

                     <p>ABSTRACT, mathematical, or phyſical truth, may be above the reach of the bulk and community of mankind. They have neither the leiſure, nor the neceſſary helps and advantages to acquire the natural knowledge of arts and ſciences. The many calls and importunities of the animal kind, take up the greateſt part of their time, thoughts, and labor, ſo that the more abſtract ſpeculations, and experimental diſquiſitions of philoſophy, are placed by providence quite out of their reach, and beyond their ſphere of action.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>moral truth,</hi> right and wrong, good and evil, the doing as we would be done by, and acting towards all men as they really are, and ſtand related in ſociety; theſe things are as evident to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as light and colors are to the eye, and may be called the intellectual, moral ſenſe. Here needs no deep learning, or trouble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of education, but the ſame truths are as evident, and as much ſeen and felt by the learned and unlearned, the gentleman and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0028500202:327"/>the ploughman, the ſavage or wild <hi>Indian,</hi> as by the beſt inſtructed philoſopher. The divine perfections ſhine through all nature, and the goodneſs and bounty of the Creator to all his creatures, impreſs the obligation of imitating this wiſeſt and beſt of Beings upon every man's heart and conſcience.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding the maxims of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are thus ſolidly eſtabliſhed, and adapted to all capacities; and though every man has a happineſs to ſeek, and a main end to ſecure, which muſt be infinitely preferable to any concerns of life, yet here it is we find, that mankind in general have been moſt loſt and bewildered, as if providence had placed their own happineſs, and the way to it, more out of their power than any thing elſe. How this ſhould happen, might ſeem unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at firſt ſight, and yet it can be no'great myſtery to any man tolerably acquainted with the world and human nature. It is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to diſcover the reaſons hereof, and it is withal highly uſeful to give them their due conſiderarion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The principal cauſe I take to be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſtrength and bias of private, corrupt, animal affection, and deſires. Reaſon is ſilenced and borne down by brutal appetite and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They reſolve to gratify their ſenſual appetites and deſires, and will therefore never taſte or try the ſuperior pleaſures and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0028500202:328"/>of reaſon and virtue. But ſuch men as theſe having declared open war againſt their own reaſon and conſcience, and being reſolved at all riſks to maintain the combat, muſt be ſelf-condemned, and cannot plead ignorance, or error of judgment in the caſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another fundamental cauſe of moral error, is the prejudice and prepoſſeſſion of a wrong education. Falſe principles and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd notions of God and religion, wrought early into the tender, unexperienced mind, and there radicated and confirmed from time to time, from youth to riper age, by parents, teachers, our moſt intimate friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and ſuch as we have the beſt opinion of, and confide moſt in; ſuch cauſes make ſuch ſtrong impreſſions, that the groſſeſt errors, thus rivetted and fixed, are with the greateſt difficulty ever conquered or cleared off. In this caſe, men turn out <hi>well-grounded believers,</hi> and are well-armed againſt convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Circumciſion or baptiſm fixes their religion in their infancy, and their church is as natural to them as their country. Free enquiry is with them an apoſtaſy from the orthodox party, and as the great and ſure tryal of their faith and fortitude, they will hear no reaſonings about the holy religion they have taken upon truſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then the few, who have applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſtudy of morality, have done it
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0028500202:329"/>for the moſt part in a manner confuſed; and ſuperficial enough: and often ſo, as even to build upon principles either entirely falſe, or obſcure and uncertain; either foreign to its proper buſineſs, or mixt up with groſs errors, and abſurdities. From whence it comes to paſs, that in all languages, the terms of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, both in common diſcourſe, and in the writings of the learned, are ſuch as have the moſt obſcure, confuſed, indetermined, and unfixed ideas, of any other terms whatever; men for the moſt part deſpiſing the things which are plain and ordinary, to run after ſuch as are extraordinary and myſterious; and that they either will not know, or reject even truth itſelf, unleſs ſhe brings ſome charm with her, to raiſe their curioſity, and gratify their paſſion for what is marvellous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common.</p>
                     <p>In ſum, the prejudices of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the illuſions of the heart, and the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny eſtabliſhed in the world with relation to opinions, form a grand obſtacle to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtudy of morality; and to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a more exact knowledge of our duty. Nor is it to be expected that any will very much apply themſelves to make diſcoveries in theſe matters, whilſt the deſire of eſteem, riches, or power, makes men eſpouſe the well-endowed opinions in faſhion, and then ſeek arguments either to make good
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0028500202:330"/>their beauty, or varniſh over and cover their deformity.—Whilſt the parties of men, cram their tenets down all men's throats, whom they can get into their power, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to examine their truth and falſehood; and will not let truth have fair play in the world, nor men the liberty to ſearch after it; what improvements can be expected of this kind? What greater light can be hoped for in the moral ſciences? The ſubject part of mankind in moſt places might, inſtead thereof, with <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs, were not the candle of the Lord ſet up by himſelf in men's minds, which it is impoſſible for the breath of man wholly to extinguiſh; how much ſoever the infallible guides of one church, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox rulers of another, may ſcheme and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſubject conſcience to human juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bring the inward principle and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of action within the cognizance of their political theocracy, or theocratic policy.</p>
                     <p>After all this, is it to be wondered at, that ſuch, whoſe occupations and diſtractions of life, or want of genius and outward helps, do not allow them to engage in long and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found meditations, are found to have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally underſtandings ſo ſhort and narrow, and ideas ſo falſe or confuſed, in matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0028500202:331"/>
And ſince this is the caſe of the greateſt part of mankind, it has no doubt been always God's will, that they, who had the greateſt light, and whom his providence had furniſhed with the greateſt helps, ſhould communicate their knowledge to ſuch, as were not able of themſelves to acquire it ſo eaſily, or in ſo great a degree.</p>

                     <head>RELIGION.</head>
                     <p>What is Religion? The true, eternal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable religion of God and nature, conſiſts, as I opine, in the filial love and fear of God, and the brotherly love of mankind; in the practice of all thoſe moral duties of truth and righteouſneſs, which reſult from it, under a fiducial truſt in, and dependence on God, and the conſtant ſenſe of his power and preſence in all our actions, as the rewarder of good and puniſher of bad men. This is the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion founded in nature and reaſon, and which muſt be at all times and every where the ſame. As this religion was in a great meaſure loſt, and neglected, amidſt the general ignorance, ſuperſtition, and idolatry of the world, it was the great buſineſs and deſign of revelation to reſtore it, and ſet moral truth and reaſon in its original light, by bringing mankind to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0028500202:332"/>the right uſe of their reaſon and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch matters.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Zeno,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of <hi>Eclec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics.</hi>
                        </note> there were no new ſucceeding ſchemes of morality, but each man betook himſelf to that ſect, where he found what moſt ſuited his own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>In the reign of <hi>Auguſtus, Potamo</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> introduced a manner of philoſophiſing, which was called the <hi>Eclectic,</hi> becauſe it conſiſted in collecting from all the tenets of preceding philoſophers, ſuch as appeared moſt reaſonable; out of which they formed each man his own ſyſtem of philoſophy.—It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>Cicero</hi>'s works, that he was an <hi>Eclectic.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And why ſhould it not be good in religion, as well as in philoſophy? I own I am an Eclectic <hi>in divinis.</hi> And the ſum of my religion is, without regard to modes or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,—ſo to live to the glory of the Father,—without attachment to the creature,—for the ſanctification and happineſs of mankind; that when this fleeting ſcene of ſin and ſorrow ſhall vaniſh, and paſs away from ſight, the angels of God may give my ſoul a ſafe tranſition to that heavenly happineſs, which no thought can lay hold on, and which no art can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>

                        <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0028500202:333"/>
                        <note place="margin">Of reaſon and truth.</note>The practice of reaſon and truth is the rule of action to God himſelf, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all true religion. It is the firſt and higheſt obligation of all rational beings, and our divine Lord came down from heaven to earth to teach it to mankind. Chriſt preached a plain doctrine to men, fitted to reform their hearts and lives—intended to make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in ſelf-denial, humility, love, goodneſs, and innocence; and to enoble them, with hearts raiſed above the world, to worſhip the <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>ſpirit</hi> and in <hi>truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this glorious religion the <hi>Romiſh</hi> prieſts have perverted into a ſyſtem of myſteries, and ſtaring contradictions, the better to ſupport the worſt and moſt deplorable purpoſes of temporal wealth, power, pride, malice, and cruelty. In direct oppoſition to reaſon and common ſenſe, we muſt commence <hi>generous believers</hi> in an <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> chriſtianity, and confeſs the ſymbol of their holy <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> though it be no more, or better, than the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a luxuriant fancy, without likeneſs and correſpondency, in the real nature and reaſon of things; 17, 4, and 19 are 41, ſays <hi>convocation</hi> to his <hi>believers,</hi> and your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, my brethren, is all a tremendous my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: You muſt adore as ſuch, what the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels renounce as a contradiction.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſhamefully do theſe prieſts ſink the credibility of our goſpel, and impoſe upon the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0028500202:334"/>ſilly people, a ball of wax for the religion of Jeſus; making them believe contrary to knowledge, and prefer a ſyſtem that is a lye againſt the light of nature, and the goſpel.</p>
                     <p>But the chief end, duty, happineſs, and higheſt perfection that man can arrive at, conſiſts, and is found, in a perfect exerciſe of <hi>human reaſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We read in <hi>Chronicles,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</note> that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his <hi>good reign</hi> with the revival of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which had long ſuffered by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and profanation, or through the neglect and omiſſion of his predeceſſors. To this purpoſe he opened the doors of the houſe of the Lord, and iſſued a decree, that all Iſrael ſhould come to keep the paſſover, which they had not done of a long time. But as the legal <hi>cleanſing</hi> and <hi>purifying,</hi> could not be performed by great numbers that did eat the paſſover, by the appointed time, on account of many things, and particularly the force of long interval and diſuſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>irregularity</hi> employed the devotion of the good king, as the canon of the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, under the ſtricteſt prohibition, and the ſevereſt penalty, forbid any one to eat, that did not come with outward and legal purity, <hi>No unclean perſon ſhall eat of it;</hi> and he prayed for the people, ſaying, The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to ſeek God,

Such a monſtrous practice was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon this foundation, that the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effects of every deceaſed perſon, his own appointment failing, ought to be laid out for promoting the good of his ſoul; and ſo the ORDINARY took poſſeſſion, without deign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to account with any mortal.—This began
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0028500202:337"/>
                        <hi>temp.</hi> Hen. I. when the ORDINARY, for the good of the ſoul of the deceaſed, obtained a directing power, and was in the nature of an overſeer, and ſomewhat more. In the time of King John, the ORDINARY <hi>drew blood,</hi> as <hi>Bacon</hi> well expreſſes it<note n="*" place="margin">Diſcourſe of laws. p. 1, and 66. and New a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the law. p. 398.</note>; for tho' the poſſeſſion was as formerly, yet the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend muſt be in the view of the church, and by which means, the dividers were but mere inſtruments, and the right was vaniſhed into the clouds. But <hi>temp.</hi> Hen. III. it was ſettled, the ORDINARY had not only gotten the game, but gorged it. Both right and poſſeſſion were now become the clergy's: the ORDINARY was to diſtribute it according to pious uſes: and no uſe ſo pious as to appoint to himſelf and his brethren.</p>
                     <p>The 1ſt ſtatute that limited the power of the ORDINARY was 13th Ed. I. c. 19. By this the ORDINARY was obliged to ſatisfy the inteſtate's death ſo far as the goods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.—And 31ſt Ed. III. cap. 2. the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual poſſeſſion was taken from the ORDINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, by obliging him to give a <hi>deputation</hi> to the next and moſt lawful friends of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate, for adminiſtrating his goods. But this ſtatute proved but a weak check to the avarice of the clergy. Means were fallen upon to elude it, by preferring ſuch of the inteſtate's relations, who were willing to offer the beſt terms: this corrupt practice was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0028500202:338"/>in the days of Hen. VIII. when the clergy loſing ground, the ſtatute 21 Hen. VIII. was enacted, bearing, "That in caſe any perſon die inteſtate, or the executors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to prove the teſtament, the <hi>Ordinary</hi> ſhall grant adminiſtration to the widow, or to the next of kin, or to both, taking ſurety for true adminiſtration."</p>
                     <p>This ſtatute, as it points out the particular perſons who are intitled to letters of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, without leaving any choice to the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> was certainly intended to cut him out of all hope of making gain of the effects of perſons dying inteſtate. But the church does not eaſily quit its hold. Means were fallen upon to elude this law alſo. Though the poſſeſſion given by this ſtatute was wreſted out of the hands of the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> yet his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſubſiſted intire, of calling the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator to account, and obliging him or her to diſtribute the effects to pious uſes. This was an admirable engine in the hands of a churchman for ſqueezing money. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator who gave any conſiderable ſhare to the Biſhop, to be laid out by him, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt,</hi> in pious uſes, would not find much difficulty in making his accompt. This rank abuſe moved the judges ſolemnly to reſolve, that the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> after adminiſtration granted by him, cannot compel the adminiſtrator to make diſtribution<note n="*" place="margin">New a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the law. p.398.</note>.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0028500202:342"/>world: God provided this better thing for us Chriſtians, that we ſhould be made happy <hi>immediately,</hi> as ſoon as we leave this world, that ſo they might not be made happy in heaven, till Chriſtianity commenced, and Chriſtians ſhould be there received to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note</hi> 1. It is plain from what the Apoſtle ſays before, that the thing <hi>promiſed</hi> is the better and more enduring ſubſtance in heaven.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>better thing provided for Chriſtians,</hi> cannot be the <hi>reſurrection</hi> from the dead, and the being, <hi>after that,</hi> received into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſince herein we ſhall have nothing better than the good people who lived under the law: therefore, better things can only mean our enjoyment of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon our leaving this world.</p>
                        <p>It is ſtrange then that Biſhop <hi>Fell,</hi> and <hi>Whitby</hi> ſay, the <hi>better thing</hi> means the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> or the heavenly country to be fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed at the end of the world.</p>
                        <p>Of the ſame opinion is <hi>Pyle.</hi>—He ſays, our pious anceſtors under the law, though in a ſtate of reſt and happineſs, after death, yet received not the full and complete enjoyment of <hi>celeſtial</hi> glory, that being deferred till the laſt and great diſpenſation of the Meſſiah be
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0028500202:343"/>paſt, that ſo they and ſincere Chriſtians, may be all rewarded and crowned together, with the happineſs both of body and ſoul, at the final day of judgment: But if ſo, tell me Mr. <hi>Pyle,</hi> where is the <hi>better thing</hi> provided for us Chriſtians?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Beſides, if the Apoſtle may be his own interpreter, the word perfect means the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ſtate of good ſouls in paradiſe, and not the complete ſtate after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. In the next chapter, he ſpeaks of the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, by which he means undoubtedly the <hi>ſeparate</hi> ſouls now in glory.</p>
                        <p>In a word, the deſign of the Apoſtle was to prove that, ſince God has provided ſome better thing for us, we appear to be more in his favour; and therefore the argument from their being juſtified to our being juſtified by faith, is ſtronger, that is, ſuch a faith as has an operative influence, by rendering our lives a comment upon the bleſſed nature of God.</p>
                        <p>And that this was the meaning of the Apoſtle in the <hi>ſomething better</hi> provided for us Chriſtians, appears yet plainer from the conſequence drawn by the inſpired writer, to wit, that we ought with the greater pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and courage to endure perſecution, ſince God has provided ſomething better for us
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0028500202:344"/>than for them. If the ancient believers held out, who expected but a ſtate of ſleep, till the time of the general reſurrection: much more ſhould we patiently ſuffer affliction, and even death itfelf, for the ſake of truth, and of the goſpel, when we know, that God has promiſed us ſomething <hi>better;</hi> to wit, that we ſhall be conducted to paradiſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after death, and be there ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and be with Chriſt, which is far better than either to ſleep after death, or to live longer in this world.</p>
                        <p>Let us lay aſide (then) every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with patience the race that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. Let us put away every thing from us, that would hinder us from improving in virtue and goodneſs; looking to and imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the leader and captain of the faithful, and an example of ſpotleſs virtue and perfect obedience. The <hi>love of the world</hi> is <hi>enmity with God,</hi> and to place our <hi>affections</hi> here, is to vilify that <hi>better proviſion</hi> which he has made for us. We are but <hi>ſtrangers</hi> and <hi>pilgrims here.</hi> The human ſtate is but a paſſage, not a place of abode.

                  <note place="margin">An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Richmond</hi> the beau, and old <hi>Ribble</hi> the chemiſt.</note>§. I. HAVING loſt <hi>Maria,</hi> as related in the ninth ſection, I went up to <hi>London,</hi> and on my way to the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, dined at a pleaſant village, not far from <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where I ſaw two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men well worth mentioning. They were ſitting in a room the waiter ſhewed me into, and had each of them a porringer of mutton broth. One of them ſeemed a little conſumptive creature, about four feet ſix inches high, uncommonly thin, or rather exſiccated to a cuticle. His broth and bread however he ſupped up with ſome reliſh. He ſeemed to be paſt threeſcore. His name was <hi>Ribble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other was a young man, once very handſome, tall and ſtrong, but ſo conſumed
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0028500202:350"/>and weak, that he could hardly ſpeak or ſtir. His name was <hi>Richmond.</hi> He attempted to get down his broth, but not above a ſpoonful or two could he ſwallow. He appeared to me to be a dying man.</p>
               <p>While I beheld things with aſtoniſhment, the ſervant brought in dinner, a pound of rump ſtakes, and a quart of green peas; two cuts of bread, a tankard of ſtrong beer, and a pint of port wine: with a fine appetite, I ſoon diſpatched my meſs, and over my wine, to help digeſtion, began to ſing the following lines:—</p>

               <p>While I was ſinging theſe lines, and all the while I was at dinner, the gentlemen looked with wonder at me, and at laſt, as ſoon as I was ſilent, old <hi>Ribble</hi> expreſſed himſelf in the following words.— You are the moſt fortunate of mortals to be ſure, Sir. A happy man indeed. You ſeem to have health and peace, contentment and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in perfection. You are the more ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when ſuch ſpectacles as my couſin <hi>Richmond</hi> (pointing to the dying gentleman in the room) and I are in contraſt before you. I will tell you our ſtories, Sir, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0028500202:352"/>for your charming ſong, and hope what I am going to ſay may be of ſervice to you, as you are coming on, and we going off from this world.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of beau <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
                  </note>My kinſman there, the dying <hi>Richmond,</hi> in that chair, was once a <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and the handſomeſt man of his time, though the remains of beauty or ſtrength cannot now be traced. By drinking and whoring he brought himſelf to what you ſee; to a ſtate that eludes all the arts of medicine. He has an aggravated cough, which produces a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pus of an aſh-colour, ſtreaked with blood, and mixed with filaments torn from his lungs and membranes, and with the utmoſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty he reſpires. He has a perpetual vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pain in his breaſt, a pricking ſoreneſs in his paps when he coughs, and defects in in all his functions. He has that flux of the belly, which is called a <hi>lientery,</hi> and the fluids of his body are waſted in colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quative ſweats. A ſtretching pain racks him if he lies on either ſide, by reaſon of ſome adheſion of the lungs to the <hi>pleura.</hi> His hair is fallen off, and his nails you ſee are dead-coloured, and hooked. His counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, you obſerve, is <hi>Hippocratical,</hi> the very image of death: his face a dead pale, his eyes ſunk, his noſe ſharp, his cheeks hollow, his temples fallen, and his whole body thin like a ſkeleton. What a figure now is this
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0028500202:353"/>once curled darling of the ladies: It was done, good Sir, by the hand of <hi>Intemperance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a temperate man, born with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note>§. 3. As to myſelf, (<hi>Ribble</hi> continued,) I brought a confumption into the world with me, and by art have ſupported under it. I was born with the ſharp ſhoulders you ſee, which are called <hi>pterogoides,</hi> or wing-like, and had a contracted thorax, and long cheſt, a thin and long neck, a flaccid tone of all the parts about the breaſt, and a very flabby contexture of the muſcles all over my body: but nevertheleſs, by a ſtrict temperance all my life, and by following the directions of Dr. <hi>Bennet</hi> in his <hi>Theatrum tabidorum,</hi> I have not only made life tolerable, but ſo removed the burden of ſtagnant phlegm from the tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, by throwing it down by ſtool, and up by expectoration, — exhaling it ſometimes through the ſkin, and at other times digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with faſting, that I contrive more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hours to myſelf than the ſtrong and young can enjoy in their continued ſcenes of diſſipation and riot. In me is ſeen the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effect of rule and ſobriety. I am now paſt fifty ſeveral years, notwithſtanding my very weak and miſerable conſtitution, and by attending to nature, and never indulging in gratification or exceſs, am not only able to live without pain, but to divert life by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental philoſophy. (<hi>Ribble</hi> went on) I
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0028500202:354"/>came down to this pleaſant place, chiefly for the benefit of poor <hi>Richmond,</hi> my kinſman, (whom you ſee with his eyes ſhut before you, the very picture of death,) and alſo, with a view to do ſome good to myſelf, as it is the fineſt air in the world. I took a houſe in the village to live the more eaſily, as the lodging-houſes are all crowded here, and reſolved to amuſe the days I have left in cultivating the ſcience of chemiſtry; not in order to finiſh what nature has begun, do you ſee me, (as the alchymiſts talk,) and procure to the imperfect metals the much deſired <hi>coction;</hi> but, to examine ſubſtances, and by the examination, obtain ideas of the bodies capable of the three degrees of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, <hi>ſpiritous, acetous,</hi> and <hi>putrid;</hi> and of the products of thoſe fermentations, to wit, <hi>ardent ſpirits, acids analogous to thoſe of vegetables and animals,</hi> and <hi>volatile alkalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe, I made for myſelf a laboratory, and about a year ago, began to employ my veſſels and furnaces in various proceſſes. A vaſt variety of entertaining things have ſince occurred, and my life is thereby made agreeable and pleaſing; though to look at my poor frame, one would think me incapable of any ſatisfactions. I will give you an inſtance or two of my amuſements, and do you judge, if they may not afford a mind more delight, than the tumultuous
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0028500202:355"/>joys of love and wine, horſe-racing, cock-fighting, hunting, and other violent pleaſures can yield.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A hiſtory of metals.</note>§. 4. You know, good Sir, I ſuppoſe, that there are ſix metals, two perfect, and four imperfect. Gold and ſilver, perfect: the others, copper, tin, lead, and iron. Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver is by ſome called a ſeventh metal: but that I think cannot be, as it is not malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Yet it is not to be confounded with the ſemi-metals, as it differs from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals no otherwiſe than by being conſtantly in <hi>fuſion;</hi> which is occaſioned by its aptneſs to flow with ſuch a ſmall degree of heat, that be there ever ſo little warmth on earth, there is ſtill more than enough to keep mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in <hi>fuſion.</hi> It muſt be called then, in my opinion, a metallic body of a particular kind: And the more ſo, let me add, as art has not yet found out a way of depriving it wholly of its <hi>Phlogiſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What <hi>phlogiſton</hi> is.</note>I muſt obſerve to you, good Sir, in order to be intelligible in what I am ſaying, that the <hi>Phlogiſton</hi> in metals is the matter of fire as a conſtituent principle in bodies. It is the element of fire combined with ſome other ſubſtance, which ſerves it as a baſis for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a kind of ſecondary principle; and it differs from pure fixed fire in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, that it communicates neither heat nor
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0028500202:356"/>light,—it cauſes no change, but only renders body apt to fuſe by the force of a culinary fire,—and it can be conveyed from body to body, with this circumſtance, that the body deprived of the <hi>phlogiſton</hi> is greatly altered, as is the body that receives it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-metals are.</note>And as to the <hi>ſemi-metals,</hi> (which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) you will be pleaſed to obſerve, that they are <hi>regulus of antimony, biſmuth, zinc,</hi> and <hi>regulus of arſenic.</hi> They are not malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and eaſily part with their <hi>phlogiſton. Zinc</hi> and <hi>biſmuth</hi> are free from the <hi>poiſonous quality:</hi> but <hi>arſenic</hi> is the moſt <hi>violent poiſon;</hi> eſpecially the <hi>ſhining cryſtalline calx</hi> of it, or <hi>flowers</hi> raiſed by the fire, and named <hi>white arſenic:</hi> and <hi>regulus of antimony</hi> is likewiſe a <hi>poiſon;</hi> not in its nature, but becauſe it always contains a portion of arſenic in its compoſition.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Antimony.</note>
                  <hi>Antimony</hi> is of a pretty white bright colour, and has the ſplendor, opacity, and gravity of a metal, but under the hammer crumbles to duſt. A moderate heat makes it flow, and a violent fire diſſipates it into ſmoke and white vapors. They adhere to cold bodies, and when the <hi>farina</hi> is collected, we call theſe vapors <hi>flowers of antimony.</hi>

                  <hi>Butter of antimony,</hi> good Sir, that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful corroſive, is a compound made by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pulverized regulus of antimony, and corroſive ſublimate. The production, on ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is a white matter, thick and ſcarce
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0028500202:357"/>fluid, which is the regulus of antimony uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the acid of ſea-ſalt. Here the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive ſublimate is decompounded, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury revivified, and the acid combined with it, quits it to join the regulus of antimony, becauſe its affinity with it is greater.</p>
               <p>(Little <hi>Ribble,</hi> the <hi>Chemiſt,</hi> went on, and with difficulty I could refrain from laughing; not on account of the man's talking nonſenſe, for his diſcourſe was the very reverſe of that; but by reaſon of the gripe he had of my arm, the pulls he gave me, if I happened to look another way, and the ſurpriſing eagerneſs with which he ſpoke; which ſhewed, that he was chemically ſtruck to an amazing degree.)</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Liver of antimony.</note>But <hi>liver of antimony,</hi> good Sir, is made of equal parts of nitre and antimony. On the mixture's being expoſed to the action of fire, a violent detonation enſues, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagrating nitre conſumes the ſulphur of the antimony, and even a part of its phlogiſton. A greyiſh matter remains after the deto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and this is what we call <hi>liver of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> It contains a fixed nitre, a vitriolated tartar, and the reguline part of antimony vitrified.</p>

                  <note place="margin">How anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates gold from other metals.</note>The principal uſe the <hi>Chemiſts</hi> make of <hi>antimony</hi> is to ſeparate gold from the other metals. All metals, gold excepted, have a greater affinity with ſulphur than the reguline
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0028500202:358" rendition="simple:additions"/>part of antimony. As to gold, it is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of contracting any union with ſulphur. If therefore I have a maſs compounded of various metals, and want to get the gold out, I melt it with antimony, and as ſoon as it flows, every thing in the maſs which is not gold, unites with the ſulphur, in or of the antimony, and cauſes two ſeparations, that of the ſulphur of antimony from its reguline part, and that of the gold from the metals with which it was mixed: This produces two new combinations. The metals and the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, in fuſion, being lighter, riſe to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; and the gold and the reguline part of antimony being heavieſt, the combination of them ſinks to the bottom. Now the buſineſs is to part theſe two, and to this purpoſe, I expoſe the combination to a degree of fire, capable of diſſipating into vapors all the <hi>ſemi-metal</hi> the maſs contains. The reguline be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing volatile, goes off by the great heat, and my gold remains pure and fixed in my crucible.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of antimonial wine.</note>As to the <hi>antimonial wine,</hi> made by the eſſence of antimony, that is, by impregnating the moſt generous white wine, with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims or leſts of antimony, which the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians have found out, it is not the part of a chemiſt to ſpeak of that; and therefore, I ſhall only obſerve to you, that it is the <hi>beſt vomit,</hi> the <hi>beſt purge,</hi> and the beſt thing for

I will tell you, good Sir, what I heard an eminent Doctor ſay of it. — Affirmo ſanctiſſime, nihil inde melius, nihil tutius, nihil efficacius, deprehendi un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, quam tritum illum, ac ſimplicem vini automonialis infuſum ex vino albo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſo, aromate aliquo ſtomachico adjecto.

Thirty drops will ſweat you effectually. About forty or fifty purges in a happy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Biſmuth.</note>But as to the ſecond ſemi-metal, <hi>biſmuth,</hi> it has almoſt the ſame appearance as <hi>regulus of antimony,</hi> but of a more duſky caſt, inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat to red. It requires leſs heat than antimony to flow, and like it, and the other ſemi-metals, is volatile, by the action of a violent fire, and under the hammer is duſt. In fuſion, it mixes well with all metals, and whitens them by union, but deſtroys their malleability. In flowing, it loſes its phlogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton with its metallic form. And it has a ſingular property, which the other ſemi-metals have not, of attenuating lead ſo as to make
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0028500202:360"/>it amalgamatic with mercury, ſo perfectly as to make it paſs with it through ſhamoy lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As ſoon as the amalgama is made, the biſmuth goes off or ſeparates; but the lead for ever remains united with the mercury.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">An extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary sympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Ink.</note>It is of a ſolution of the ore of <hi>biſmuth,</hi> we make that very curious and uſeful thing, called <hi>ſympathetic ink,</hi> which is a liquor of a beautiful colour, like that of the lilach or pipe-tree bloſſom. The proceſs in preparing this liquor is tedious and difficult by <hi>aqua fortis, aqua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi> and fire, and therefore the ink is rarely to be met with. It is not to be had, unleſs ſome gentleman who makes chemiſtry his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gives one a preſent of a bottle of it; as I do now to you, in hopes it may ſome time or other be of ſingular ſervice to you; for I have conceived a great regard for you, tho' I never ſaw you before, as you ſeem not only more teachable than any I have met with, but to delight in the information I give you relating to chemical things.</p>
               <p>Here I returned my <hi>Chemiſt</hi> many thanks, and profeſſed my eternal obligation to him; that I could liſten for years to him; and wiſhed it was poſſible to become his diſciple, that I might ſee him by experiment facilitate the ſtudy of a ſcience, more entertaining, inſtructive, and extenſively uſeful than any other. But how, dear Sir, am I to uſe this ink, you are ſo vaſtly good as to give me,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0028500202:361"/>to make it more uſeful than any other ink could be?</p>
               <p>I will tell you (<hi>Ribble</hi> replied): you muſt write with this lilach-coloured liquor, on good well gummed paper, that does not ſink; and the ſingularity of the ink, conſiſts in its property of diſappearing entirely, and becoming invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though it be not touched with any thing whatever: And this diſtinguiſhes it from all others. The writing muſt dry in a warm air, and while it is cold no colour can be perceived: but gently warming it before the fire, the writing gradually acquires a greeniſh blue colour, which is viſible as long as the paper continues a little warm, and diſappears entirely when it cools. When other ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic inks are made to appear by proper application, they do not diſappear again; but this liquor from the ore of <hi>biſmuth</hi> muſt have the fire or heat kept to it, to render it legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If a man writes to his miſtreſs, ſuppoſe, or to a miniſter of ſtate, with lemon juice, once the writing has been warmed by the fire, and the letters by that means appear, the epiſtle may be afterwards read at any time and place; but if the lady's father ſhould by accident get your letter, written in lilach-coloured liquor, it muſt ſtill remain a ſecret to him: For if on getting it, and opening the ſeal, he could ſee no writing, and therefore imagining it was writ with lemon juice, or
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0028500202:362"/>ſome other ſympathetic ink, he ſhould hold it himſelf to the fire, or bid his ſervant hold it to the heat, that the letters might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and made viſible, yet the moment <hi>biſmuth-ink</hi> is taken away from the fire, and begins to cool, it is as inviſible again, as a ſheet of white paper. How ſerviceable this may be on various occaſions, may be eaſily conceived.</p>

                  <hi>Regulus of arſenic,</hi> the fourth ſemi-metal, has a colour reſembling lead, unites readily with metallic ſubſtances, and renders them brittle, unmalleable, and volatile.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0028500202:363"/>which the other metallic ſubſtances are free, when they are not combined with a ſaline matter. Theſe things being noticed, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to metals, and ſemi-metals in general, I will now proceed to relate a few curious caſes, in reſpect of the metals.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of gold.</note>
                  <hi>Gold,</hi> our firſt metal, has ten ſenſible cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terions. It is the heavieſt and denſeſt of all bodies: the moſt ſimple of all bodies: the moſt fixed of all bodies: the only body that cannot be turned into ſcoriae, by antimony and lead; the moſt ductile of all bodies: ſo ſoft as to be ſcarcely elaſtic or ſonorous: muſt be red hot to melt: is diſſolvable by ſea-ſalt and its preparations, but remains untouched by any other ſpecies of ſalts; and of conſequence not liable to ruſt; as <hi>aqua regia</hi> and ſpirit of ſea-ſalt do not float in the air, unleſs in labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories; or chemiſts ſhops, where we find them ſometimes: It unites ſpontaneouſly with pure quick-ſilver: It never waſtes by emitting <hi>effluvia,</hi> or exhalations. Theſe are the ten ſenſible properties or characteriſtics of this metal. It is certainly pure gold, if it has theſe criterions, and they are of great uſe in life; eſpecially to perſons who have to do with that ſubtil tribe, the <hi>alchemiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>weight</hi> of gold, it is more than nineteen times heavier than water, bulk for bulk, and this property is inſeparable from it; it being impoſſible to render gold more
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0028500202:364"/>or leſs heavy; and for this reaſon, the <hi>ſpecific gravity</hi> of gold, if it had no other criterion, might demonſtrate <hi>real gold.</hi> To make gold, other metals muſt be rendered equiponderant to it: And therefore, if an alchemiſt ſhould offer to obtrude a metal on you for gold, hang an equal weight of pure, and of ſuſpected gold by two threads to a nice ballance, and on immerging them in water, if the alchemiſt's gold be pure, the water will retain both pieces in <hi>oequilibrio;</hi> otherwiſe, the adulterate metal will riſe, and the pure deſcend.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, all bodies loſe ſome of their weight in a fluid, and the weight which a body loſes in a fluid, is to its whole weight, as the ſpecific gravity of the fluid is to that of the body. The ſpecific gravity of a body is the weight of it, when the bulk is given; 38 grains of gold weighed in the air, is not the true weight of it: for there it loſes the weight of an equal bulk of air: It weighs only 36 grains in the water, and there it loſes the weight of as much water, as is equal in bulk to itſelf, that is, 2 grains, and as the gold weighs 38 grains, it follows, that the weight of water is to that of gold, bulk for bulk, as 2 to 38, that is, as the weight loſt in the fluid is to the whole weight.</p>
               <p>And ſo, if a piece of gold, and a piece of copper, are equiponderant in air, yet in water the gold will outweigh the copper; becauſe
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0028500202:365"/>their bulks, tho' of equal weight, are inverſely as their ſpecific gravities, that is, the gold muſt be as much leſs than the copper, as the ſpecific gravity of gold is greater than that of copper: And as they muſt both loſe weight in proportion to bulk in water, therefore the gold, the leſſer of the two, loſes leſs of its weight than the copper does, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, out-weighs the copper in water. I hope this is clear. The caſe is the ſame, in proportion, in pure gold, and gold mixed with other metals. The bulk of the pure gold muſt be leſs than that of allayed gold, and its weight greater in water; tho' both equiponderate (a pound ſuppoſe) in air.</p>
               <p>It is very plain, Sir, and I requeſt you will proceed. You give me valuable information, and oblige me very much. This pleaſed the Chemiſt, and the ingenious little <hi>Ribble</hi> went on.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of gold, we mean, by a ſimple body, that whoſe minuteſt part has all the phyſical properties of the whole maſs. Now diſſolve a grain of gold in <hi>aqua regia,</hi> and from a ſingle drop of the ſolution, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of gold may be ſeparated, and have all the characters of gold, (except thoſe of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,) though the ſeparated particle of gold ſhall only be the millionth part of the grain. —Or, fuſe a ſingle grain of gold with a maſs of ſilver, and mix the whole together, ſo that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0028500202:366"/>the gold ſhall be equally diſtributed: then take a particle thereof, and you will have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of perfect gold; for diſſolve the leaſt part of the mixture in <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> and a quantity of gold will precipitate to the bottom. It will bear the ſame proportion to the grain, that the part diſſolved did to the whole maſs.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned <hi>aqua regia</hi> and <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> I muſt, to be intelligible, ſay two or three words in relation to them. <hi>Aqua regia</hi> is an extract by fire from ſea-ſalt and ſpirit of nitre. The acid liquor that comes over from them into the receiver, is <hi>aqua regis.—Aqua fortis,</hi> or <hi>ſpirit of nitre,</hi> is a nitrous acid ſeparated from its baſis, <hi>nitre,</hi> by the vitriolic acid. <hi>Aqua regis</hi> only will diſſolve gold. Silver is not ſoluble by <hi>aqua regis;</hi> its proper ſolvent is the <hi>acid of nitre</hi> or <hi>aqua fortis.</hi> — But if you want to ſeparate a maſs of gold and ſilver, either will do. You may diſſolve the gold by <hi>aqua regia,</hi> and let the ſilver remain pure: or, diſſolve the ſilver by <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> and let the gold remain pure. Only note in this caſe of a mixed lump of gold and ſilver, the operation by <hi>aqua fortis</hi> is preferable, for this reaſon; that <hi>aqua regis</hi> in diſſolving the gold, takes up likewiſe a little ſilver; but <hi>aqua fortis</hi> hath not the leaſt effect on gold:—And note further, that if there be equal parts of gold and ſilver in the mixture, they cannot be
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0028500202:367"/>parted by <hi>aqua fortis.</hi> It has not then the leaſt effect on the ſilver, which is very ſtrange. To make <hi>aqua fortis</hi> act duly on ſilver mixed with gold, the ſilver muſt be at leaſt in a triple proportion to that of the gold. The reaſon of the ſingular effect is, that when the gold exceeds, or the parts of both are equal in quantity, then, as both are intimate, united in the maſs, the parts or minims of the gold coat over the parts of the ſilver, and defend them from the action of the <hi>aqua fortis.</hi> In this caſe, <hi>aqua regia</hi> muſt be uſed to diſſolve the gold, and leave the ſilver pure: or, as <hi>aqua regia</hi> takes up a little of the ſilver, when it diſſolves the gold, melt the metalline maſs, and add as much ſilver, as will make it a triple proportion to the gold. Then you may by <hi>aqua fortis</hi> take up all your ſilver in the diſſolution, and leave all the gold pure.</p>
               <p>But as to the third criterion of gold, its being the moſt fixed of all bodies, this is evident from the violence of fire having no effect on it. An ounce of it expoſed for the ſpace of two months, in the eye of a glaſs furnace, does not loſe half a grain. It may from thence be ſaid to be incorruptible.</p>
               <p>As to gold's reſiſting <hi>antimony,</hi> and not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>ſcoriae</hi> by its force, it is moſt certain from hence, that if you take a maſs conſiſting of gold, ſilver, copper, the other metals, with ſtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fuſe it with antimony, the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0028500202:368"/>bodies will flow on the ſurface, and be eaſily blown off by the bellows: the antimony all evaporates, and leaves the gold alone. This is called the laſt teſt of gold, to try the purity of it. If the remaining gold have loſt nothing of its weight, it is allowed perfectly pure, and called <hi>gold of twenty-four carats;</hi> or if it be found 1/24 lighter, it is ſaid to be twenty-three carats fine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ductility of gold.</note>But as to the <hi>ductility</hi> of gold, this is the moſt extraordinary property of it. The arts of gold-beating and wire-drawing, ſhew us things quite amazing. In leaf-gold, a grain and a quarter of the metal, may be made to cover an area of fifty ſquare inches; and if the leaf be divided by parallel lines 1/100 part of an inch, a grain of gold will be divided into five hundred thouſand minute ſquares, all diſcernible by the eye: yet this is not the moſt can be done by the hammer. A ſingle grain of gold may be ſtretched into a leaf that will cover a houſe, and yet the leaf remain ſo compact, as not to tranſmit the rays of light, nor ever admit ſpirit of wine to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſude. This however is nothing to the effects of wire-drawing.</p>
               <p>A gold wire is only a ſilver one gilt, and if you coat a ſilver cylinder of forty-eight ounces weight, with one ounce of gold, which is ſufficient, this cylinder may be drawn out into a wire ſo very fine, that two yards thereof
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0028500202:369" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhall weigh only one grain, and 98 yards only 49 grains, ſo that one grain of gold gilds 98 yards; and of courſe the ten thouſandth part of a grain, is above one third part of an inch long. And ſince the third part of an inch is yet capable of being divided into ten leſſer parts viſible to the eye, it is evident that the hundred thouſandth part of a grain of gold, may be ſeen without the help of a micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope: And yet ſo intimately do its parts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, that though the gold wherewith the wire is coated, be ſtretched to ſuch a degree, there is not any appearance of the colour of ſilver underneath. Nor is this all.</p>
               <p>In <hi>ſupergildings,</hi> that is, to make the richeſt lace, they employ but 6 ounces of gold, to cover or gild 45 marks of ſilver, that is, <hi>twenty-two pounds and a half avordupoiſe weight,</hi> rounded into the form of a cylinder or roller, which hath fifteen lines in diameter, and twenty-two inches in length; and here the ſtratum of gold which invelopes the ingot that is to be drawn into wire, hath no more thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than the fifteenth part of a line, which is extremely thin; as a line is the twelfth part of an inch.</p>
               <p>But to make the common gold-thread, they do not uſe more than two ounces of gold, and ſometimes not more than one, to gild or cover ingot I have mentioned, and then the inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping ſtratum is not more in thickneſs, if
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0028500202:370" rendition="simple:additions"/>two ounces be employed, than the 45th part of a line; and if one ounce be uſed, but the 90th part of a line. Two ounces of gold is generally uſed, in gilding or covering the ingot I have mentioned, and vaſtly thinner muſt the ſtratum be, when the ingot is drawn till it ſurpaſſes the <hi>fineneſs</hi> of a <hi>hair,</hi> and the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter is nine thouſand times ſmaller than what it had in the maſs: By weighing out half a dram of this thread or wire, it is found by meaſuring the length of the half dram, that the ingot of 22 ½ pounds, and 22 inches long, is changed into a length of 1163520 feet, that is, ninety-ſix leagues and 196 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom; for the half dram of wire or thread meaſures 202 feet; by conſequence, an ounce of it, 3232 feet; a mark of it, or eight oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 25856 feet. And yet, aſtoniſhing as this length is, for two ounces of bold to be drawn to, the gold which covers the ſilver never ceaſes to gild it. The gold ſtill keeps pace with the wire, ſtretch it to what length the drawers can, through the wire-drawing irons, and holes much ſmaller one than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The ſilver never appears.</p>
               <p>It does not however reſt there. Before the thread or wire is wound on ſilk, and before they ſpin it, it muſt be flatted by paſſing it between ſteel wheels extremely well poliſhed, and this flatting increaſes its length to more than a ſeventh part. One ingot, therefore,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0028500202:371"/>of 8 marks or 22 ½ pounds, and 22 inches long, by this increaſe of a 7th part, is brought to the length of 111 leagues, that is, about 300 Engliſh miles.</p>
               <p>But amazing as this extent is, it is not the utmoſt bounds to which the ductility of gold may be carried. One ounce only of gold is ſometimes uſed to cover one ingot, and drawn to the length I have mentioned, and by the time it has paſſed the flatting wheels, the gold that covers the ſilver <hi>laminae,</hi> muſt have its thickneſs reduced to leſs than the millionth part of a line; that is, a twelve millionth of an inch. This is beyond the reach of our conception. Imagination cannot plumb her line ſo low.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, (I ſaid) May not the gold be divided into ſmall grains <hi>ſeparate</hi> one from another, but yet <hi>near enough</hi> to give their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to the ſilver? Though we may not be able to ſee the thing, yet I think it may be imagined; the <hi>gold</hi> on the <hi>laminae</hi> doth not form a continued leaf.</p>
               <p>Experience, good Sir, demonſtrates the contrary,—that every point of ſilver hath its cover of gold. Put a piece of this gilt wire in <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> the ſilver will be diſſolved, and the gold left a perfect, continuous tube. It is an amazing thing! And ſhews the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of the firſt cauſe! As to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this ductility, and why gold in ſuch a
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0028500202:372"/>manner adheres to ſilver, ſo as never to part from it, if the 22 ½ pounds of ſilver gilded with one ounce of gold could be extended by art for ever, this is paſt our finding out. It is a ſecret of nature we cannot form any idea of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calignoſa nocte premit Deus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ribble</hi> went on. Theſe are the things moſt remarkable in relation to <hi>gold;</hi> and I have only to add, that as to the manner of getting it, it is found ſometimes in glebes or clods, conſiſting of gold alone; ſometimes in a powdry form, and then called <hi>gold- duſt,</hi> or ſand-gold, in the ſands and mud of rivers and brooks; but moſt commonly in whitiſh clods, dug out of mines of vaſt depth, and intermixed with ſilver and various foſſils. This they reduce by fire to a maſs of metal, and by <hi>aqua regia</hi> or <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> the gold is eaſily taken out of the ore.</p>
               <p>And as to <hi>gold</hi>'s being ſo yielding and <hi>duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> by human art, it is to be obſerved, that in return it exerts a greater power on the human mind. Paſſive it is in its ductility, but more active in its influence on man. It is a <hi>greater tyrant</hi> than a <hi>ſlave.</hi> It drives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated millions of the human race to death and hell. King of metals as it is, bright and glorious to behold, and what procures innumerable bleſſings to mankind; yet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the grace of God, to moderate the paſſion
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0028500202:373"/>for it, and to direct the mind in a true uſe of it, it is more dangerous to beings on a trial in a firſt ſtate, than even poverty can be in this lower hemiſphere. What villainies are daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to get it! What iniquities daily perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by thoſe who have plenty of it! <hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> ſhould relate as well to too much of it, as to a total want of it; and it is well prayed,—<hi>In all time of our wealth, good Lord deliver us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ribble</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluſion, containing his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious thoughts and advice.</note>In my opinion, neither poverty nor riches, but a middle ſtate, is the thing we ſhould deſire. It is in this condition, we can beſt live <hi>ſoberly,</hi> or with a ſound mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ourſelves as thoſe who have an intelligent ſpirit to preſide in body. Too much gold moſt commonly inverts this order, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an apoſtaſy that ſets the inferior powers in the throne, and enſlaves the mind to the body: It gives the <hi>paſſions</hi> the <hi>commanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi> and makes <hi>reaſon</hi> receive <hi>law</hi> from <hi>appetite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we look into the world, we find too often, in this caſe, that wealth is big with innumerable ſins. The rich are filled with wine, wherein is exceſs, and ſhew an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled diſſoluteneſs of manners. Their eyes behold ſtrange women, and their hearts utter perverſe things. Inſtead of regarding the common good, they commit the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0028500202:374"/>injuries. Of ſuch a hardning nature is too much <hi>gold,</hi> that it tends to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inſenſible and ſtupid, and renders it for ever unapt for impreſſion. Then whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and wine, and new wine, take away the heart, and men are made to forget the law of God.</p>
               <p>But having neither poverty nor riches, in the calm middle ſtate, having all reaſonable conveniencies, we can fairly come by; a vaſt variety of creatures for our food, and <hi>wine</hi> in its ſeaſon, to <hi>make glad the heart;</hi> we may then partake of the bounties of providence, with a ſober freedom, and at the ſame time, can beſt lay up for ourſelves a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or ſecuity for the time to come, that we may lay hold of eternal life.</p>
               <p>Tho' it is with a proſpect of difficulties, that all muſt enter upon religion, and with labour and difficulty, maintain our ground, and acquit ourſelves like chriſtians, that is, reſiſt the devil in all his aſſaults, overcome the world in its enſnaring influence, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the irregular inclinations of nature; yet in the happy middle ſtate, where there is no poverty nor riches, that is, great wealth, we can make everlaſting glory and felicity our governing aim, and bound our ambition and deſires by nothing ſhort of the reſurrection of the dead. We may live in a full and ready ſubmiſſion of the ſoul to the authority of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0028500202:375"/>God's word. Things eternal may have the aſcendant in our practical judgment, and then with pleaſure we become followers of them, who through faith and patience inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the promiſes.</p>
               <p>Good Sir, this is all our ſowing time, and whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. He that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of his fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. And therefore, whether your lot be caſt in the happy middling ſtate, or you were born to thouſands a year, let wiſdom be your rule, and prefer that happineſs which has everlaſting duration, in the realms of light above, to any preſent good that can come in competition with it. Do not ſpend money for that which is not bread— and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that which ſatisfieth not. Do not employ your pains for that which hath <hi>vanity</hi> written upon it, by the word of God, by the teſtimony of the wiſeſt men, and by frequent experience: but let your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal regard be for your immortal ſoul, when nothing can be given in exchange for the ſoul. Implore the light and grace of the good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by the quickening influences of the Father of the univerſe, and the exertion of your whole ſtrength, let it be the principal labour of your every day, to make advances in the divine life, and be a bleſſing to ſociety
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0028500202:376"/>wherever you come. In <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> may you excel.</p>
               <p>You will pardon old <hi>Ribble,</hi> I hope, good Sir, and excuſe his addreſſing himſelf to you in this manner. It is an odd concluſion, I own, to a diſcourſe on <hi>metals</hi> and <hi>ſemi-metals;</hi> but it is from an extreme regard I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for you, that I talk as I do, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to call upon you, (as you are a young man of fortune, I ſuppoſe) to conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of that <hi>decree,</hi> which is the reſult of unerring wiſdom, and the will of the Rector of the univerſe, to wit, that we are all under the <hi>law of death,</hi> and through that gate muſt paſs, perhaps at a day's, an hour's warning, to the <hi>reſurrection of the dead,</hi> to be adjudged to happineſs or miſery, as time has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and life ſpent here. This is the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> of the Moſt High God, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it is incumbent on us, to prepare for the <hi>awful hereafter,</hi> and endeavour by good actions, and a virtuous mind, by purity of conſcience, and an exalted piety, to <hi>come off well</hi> in judgment. Happy—thrice happy they that do ſo.</p>
               <p>Here little <hi>Ribble</hi> the <hi>Chemiſt</hi> had done, and I had reaſon to return him my very hearty thanks for the favour of his whole diſcourſe.

                  </note>§ 3. Reflecting on the wonders of the metals, which I had heard old <hi>Ribble</hi> ſo well diſcourſe of, and being more intent on what had been told me of theſe things, that I might never forget ſuch uſeful learning, I trotted on for ſeveral hours without minding the road, and arrived as the ſun was ſetting in a deep and melancholy vale, through which a pleaſant river run, that by the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur of its ſtreams, ſeemed to be marked out for the rendezvous of the thoughtful, who love the deep receſſes, and embowring woods, with the ſoft thrillings of gliding ſtreams, as much as the ſprightly court the gayeſt ſcenes. In this ſweet ſpot, I found a pretty country houſe, and not knowing where I was, rid up to the door, to enquire my way. A gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who ſeemed to be about forty, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appeared, let me know I was at a conſiderable diſtance from any town, and as it was near ten, told me I had beſt reſt with him that night, and I was moſt heartily welcome. This was humane and civil. I accepted the kind invitation, and immediately went in with him. He brought me into a decent room, and gave me a handſome meal. We
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0028500202:378"/>had a couple of bottles after ſupper, talked of a thouſand things, and then withdrew to wind up the machines. He would not let me ſtir the next morning, and after dinner we became well acquainted. Six days this gentleman prevailed with me to ſtay at his houſe, and then I left him with regret. He was ſo generous, ſo civil, and in every thing ſo agreeable, that I could not avoid admiring him, and regarding him to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme degree. His name was <hi>Monckton.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Character of Mr. <hi>Monckton.</hi>
                  </note>§ 4. <hi>Avery Monckton</hi> had ſeen the world, when he was a young man, and by reading much, and thinking a great deal, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an extenſive knowledge, and a deep penetration. In him the gentleman and the ſcholar were viſible. He ſeemed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to folly, and his philoſophy appeared to be an aſſiduous examination of his ideas, fancies, and opinions, in order to render them true and juſt. His religion conſiſted in a chearful ſubmiſſion to the divine pleaſure, with reſpect to all things independent of us, or abſolutely external to us; and in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued exertion of benevolence, in doing all the good he could. What the theology of ſects was, and the notions of divines, he never minded. It was his opinion, that an <hi>active charity</hi> is the only thing that can <hi>liken</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> us to the original benevolent mind:
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0028500202:379"/>and that it is reaſonable to ſubmit to all his diſpenſations, ſince the providence of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely perfect Being, muſt do all for the beſt in the whole. This was <hi>Avery Monckton,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> In his perſon he was tall, and very thin.</p>
               <p>This gentleman told me the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſtory relating to himſelf, on my aſking him, if he had ever been married?— Yes, Sir, he replied: When I was about five and twenty, a young lady came in my way, who had all the external charms that ever adorned a woman, and I thought her mind as perfect in goodneſs of every kind, as minds can be on this earth. I made my addreſſes to her, and with ſome difficulty perſuaded her to accept of a good jointure, and be a wife; for ſhe had got it into her head, that chriſtian perfection conſiſted in a virgin-life. I loved her to an extreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and fancied myſelf beyond mortals happy, as her fondneſs ſeemed equal to my paſſion, and ſhe expreſſed it in a moſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting way. Three months paſſed on in this delightful manner, and I ſhould have thought an age but minutes, if the ſcene was to have no change. But every thing muſt have an end in this poor ſtate. Buſineſs called me one morning early into the city, and till it was late at night, I thought not to return: Back however I was compelled to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0028500202:380"/>go for ſome papers, I had forgot, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to ſurprize agreeably my wife, came in by a key I had, at the waſh-houſe door, and unſeen went ſoftly up to my chamber, where I expected to find my beloved in a ſweet ſleep. Gently I touched the lock, and intended, as my charmer ſlumbered, to give this idol of my heart a kiſs: But, as I opened the door without being heard, I ſaw a man by my bed-ſide, and my fond faithful wife, buttoning up his breeches. Amazement ſeized me, but I was not in a rage. I only ſaid, is that <hi>Louiſa</hi> I ſee, and ſhut the door. Down ſtairs I went immediately, and out again the ſame way I came in. I was done with love for ever, and from that time never ſaw my wife more. A ſhip being to ſail the next day for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I went a paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in it, and reſolved to live abroad ſome years.</p>
               <p>Six years I reſided in <hi>Greece,</hi> and viſited every curious place: Four I ſpent in <hi>Aſia minor,</hi> and two in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted myſelf with noting down the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary things I ſaw, and I purchaſed ſeveral fine antiquities by the way. When done, I came back to my country again, and this little ſeat I now live at, being to be ſold, I bought it immediately, and have reſided here ever ſince. My ſtudy, my garden, and my horſe, divert me fully and finely every day.
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0028500202:381"/>I have all I deſire in this world, and reign more happily over my few ſubjects, in this airy, ſilent, ſecret ſpot, than the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch can do on a throne. My people are only one young man, who is my gardener, my footman, and my groom, and two old women, my maids. Theſe are ever attentive to my will, and by their good behaviour and management, make my lodge as agreeable, and life as pleaſing, as can be expected in this ſyſtem of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monckton</hi>'s ſtory pleaſed me much, and I wondered greatly at his happy temper, when he ſaw his beloved wife buttoning up the breeches of the man. But did you ever hear what became of her after?—And faulty as ſhe was, may there not be found an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt charming woman, to render your hours more delightful than ſtudy and contrivance can make them, without a ſoft partner thro' life? Come into the world with me, Sir, and I will engage to find out for you a mere primitive chriſtian of a woman, with all the beauties of body that <hi>Lucian</hi> gives his images.</p>
               <p>You are very good, Sir, (<hi>Monckton</hi> replied) in offering to look out for another wife for me, and I thank you very heartily, for your well-meant kindneſs; but as I never enquired what became of my firſt wife, from the morning I left her, and know only that ſhe is dead,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0028500202:382"/>as her jointure has not been demanded for ſeveral years paſt; ſo ſhall I never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with a ſecond. Perhaps there are ſome honeſt women in the world. I hope ſo: but I have had enough of marriage. Beſide, I think it time now to turn my thoughts a better way. In the forty-fifth year of my age, it cannot be weak, to begin to conſider the great change before me, and fix my hopes on a good remove into ſome better and happier region. If I was unfortunate with a wife when a young man, I have little reaſon to expect better days with one, as age comes on. I might find myſelf again moſt ſadly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. But there can be no diſappointment in making it the principal work of life, to prepare, in ſuch a retirement as this, for that approaching hour, when we muſt ſubmit to the power and tyranny of death and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By this means, the greateſt happineſs may be ſecured. In every thing elſe, there is uncertainty and vanity. I ſpeak princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in reſpect of my time of life, who am haſtning faſt to fifty: but at every time, it is my opinion, that men, as rationals, and beings who take on themſelves the honourable profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the chriſtian religion, ſhould not comply with the criminal liberties allowed in the world, and give into the illicit uſages and cuſtoms of place and company, for fear of ridicule, or to avoid giving offence; but keep
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0028500202:383"/>ſtrictly to the will and laws of their higher country, and in all things have a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to holineſs, and truth, and purity.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay this by way of preaching, but that you may thereby have a truer idea of the man you chanced to find in a lone houſe on this vaſt common. Seven years have I now lived here, and in all that time, have not been once in <hi>London:</hi> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I ride to a neighbouring village, and if on the road, or at an inn, I can pick up a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible agreeable man, I love to dine with him, and drink a pint of wine. Such a man I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ride in queſt of, and if he be intirely to my mind, (which is very rarely the caſe,) I invite him home with me, to paſs at my lodge two or three days. Far then am I from being unſocial, though I live in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; but I left the world, becauſe I was ill-uſed in it, and happen to think very differently from the generality of men. Here <hi>Monckton</hi> ended his ſtory, and a little after we parted.</p>

I rid for ſix hours without meeting with any thing remarkable; but as I baited about three o'clock at a lone inn, the ſituation of which was ſo fine in foreſt and water, that I determined to go no further that day, there arrived a little after, a young lady, her maid, and two men ſervants. They were all well-mounted, and the lady's beaſt in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0028500202:384"/>as great a beauty of its kind, as its miſtreſs was among women.

This ſpot in <hi>Lybia</hi> is to this day the ſame beautiful and wonderful place; the moſt charming piece of ground in the world, in the midſt of the moſt horrible deſarts; but inſtead of <hi>Corniger,</hi> (as <hi>Lucan</hi> calls <hi>Ammon</hi>) an <hi>African</hi> prince named <hi>Abu Derar,</hi> now reigns there, and his palace ſtands where the temple ſtood in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s and <hi>Cato</hi>'s time. I ſaw not long ago a gentleman who had been on the ſpot and told me this. He further ſaid, that this king and his people had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the chriſtian religion by an <hi>Abyſſinian prieſt,</hi> and had better notions of chriſtianity than many of our great divines; for they have not a thought of <hi>trinity in unity;</hi> nor would they ſay, to gain the whole world, what the great Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> does in one of his ſermons, to wit, <hi>that whatſoever pain or miſery God himſelf did ſuffer</hi> in his human nature: Or as <hi>Trapp</hi> expreſſes himſelf in his diſcourſe on the marriage at <hi>Cana, —A ſweet ſmile ſat on the face of the great God:</hi>— meaning <hi>Jeſus:</hi> — Horrible ſayings! O wretched ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy!

FOR ſix weeks after our marriage, we reſided at the inn, on account of the charms of the ground, and ſeemed to be in poſſeſſion of a laſting happineſs it is
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0028500202:391"/>impoſſible for words to deſcribe. Every thing was ſo ſmooth and ſo round, that we thought proſperity muſt be our own for many years to come, and were quite ſecure from the flames of deſtruction; but calamity laid hold of us, when we had not the leaſt reaſon to expert it, and from a fulneſs of peace and felicity, we ſunk at once into an abyſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.

This was a diſmal ſcene. She lived about an hour, and repeated the following fine lines from <hi>Boiſſard,</hi> when ſhe ſaw me weeping as I kneeled on the ground by her;—</p>

Can you form an idea, Reader, of the diſtreſs I was then in? If is not poſſible I think,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0028500202:394"/>unleſs you have been exactly in the ſame ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; unleſs you loved like me, and have
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0028500202:395" rendition="simple:additions"/>been as miſerably ſeparated from as charming a woman. But it was in vain for me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue lamenting. She was gone for ever,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0028500202:396"/>and lay as the <hi>clod of the valley</hi> before me. Her body I depoſited in the next church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and immediately after, rid as faſt as I could to <hi>London,</hi> to loſe thought in diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſign the better to the decree. For ſome days I lived at the inn I ſet up at, but as ſoon as I could, went into a lodging, and it happened to be at the houſe of the famous <hi>Curl</hi> the bookſeller; a man well known in the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> and <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>letters to his friends,</hi> on account of <hi>Curl</hi>'s frauds in purchaſing and printing ſtolen copies of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s works. It is in relation to theſe <hi>tricks,</hi> that <hi>Pope</hi> mentions <hi>Curl</hi> in his <hi>Dunciad</hi> and <hi>Letters.</hi> A ſuccinct hiſtory of him I ſhall here give: but had I complied with his requeſts, it would have been a long relation, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and glory of this extraordinary man: For he came one morning into my cloſet, with an apron full of papers; being letters, memorandums, parodies, and notes, written by or concerning himſelf; and requeſted I would, on a good conſideration, write his life, to his profit and honour, and make it a five ſhilling book. That I ſaid was not then in my power to do: but I would, one time or other, give the public a true account of him,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0028500202:397"/>and make it conclude I hoped to the glory of his character. Here it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and character of <hi>Curl</hi> the Bookſeller.</note>§. 2. CURL was in perſon very tall and thin, an ungainly, aukward, white-faced man. His eyes were a light-grey, large, projecting, gog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le and pur-blind. He was ſplay-footed, and baker-kneed.</p>
               <p>He had a good natural underſtanding, and was well acquainted with more than the title pages of books. He talked well on ſome ſubjects. He was not an infidel as Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> miſrepreſents him in one of her letters to lady <hi>Hartford,</hi> (afterwards Dutcheſs of <hi>Somerſet</hi>). He told me, it was quite evident to him, that the <hi>ſcriptures</hi> of the Old and New Teſtament contained a <hi>real revelation.</hi> There is for it a <hi>rational, a natural, a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary,</hi> and a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> teſtimony; which rendered it quite certain to him. He ſaid, he no more doubted the truth of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, than he did the exiſtence of an independent ſupreme Creator; but he did not believe the expoſitions given by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. So far <hi>Curl</hi> was right enough. His fault was, that with ſuch a belief, he took no pains with his heart. Truſting intirely to the <hi>merits the Saviour,</hi> like too many other miſtaken chriſtians, he had no notion of religion as an <hi>inviſible thing within us,</hi> called the <hi>kingdom of God:</hi> He did not even conſider it as a good outſide thing, that
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0028500202:398"/>recommends a man to his fellow-creatures. He was a debauchee to the laſt degree, and ſo injurious to ſociety, that by filling his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations with wretched notes, forged letters, and bad pictures, he raiſed the price of a four ſhilling book to ten. Thus, in particular, he managed <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Archiology: And when I told him he was very culpable in this, and other articles he ſold, his anſwer was, What would I have him do? He was a bookſeller. His <hi>tranſlators</hi> in <hi>pay,</hi> lay three in a bed, at the <hi>Pewter-Platter</hi> Inn in <hi>Holborn,</hi> and he and they were for ever at work, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Public. He likewiſe printed the lewdeſt things. He loſt his ears for the <hi>Nun in her Smock,</hi> and another thing. As to drink, he was too fond of money, to ſpend any in making himſelf happy that way; but at another's expence, he would drink every day till he was quite blind, and as incapable of ſelf-motion as a block. This was <hi>Edmund Curl:</hi> But he died at laſt as great a penitent, (I think in the year 1748) as ever expired. I mention this to his glory.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Curl</hi> knew the world well, and was acquainted with ſeveral extraordinary charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he was of great uſe to me at my firſt coming to town, as I knew nobody, nor any place. He gave me the true characters of many I ſaw, told me whom I ſhould avoid, and with whom I might be free. He brought me to the play-houſes, and gave me a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0028500202:399"/>account of every actor. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood thoſe things well. No man could talk better on theatrical ſubjects. He brought me likewiſe to Sadler's Wells, to the night-cellars, and to <hi>Tom King</hi>'s, the famous night-houſe at <hi>Covent Garden.</hi> As he was very knowing, and well-known at ſuch places, he ſoon made me as wiſe as himſelf in theſe branches of learning; and, in ſhort, in the ſpace of a month, I was as well acquainted in <hi>London,</hi> as if I had been there for years. My kind preceptor ſpared no pains in lecturing.</p>
               <p>But what of all things I thought moſt wonderful was the company I ſaw at the Sieur <hi>Curl</hi>'s. As he was intimate with all the high whores in town, many of them frequented his ſhop, to buy his dialogues, and other lively books. Some of theſe girls he often aſked to dine with him, and then I was ſure to be a gueſt. Many very fine women I thereby ſaw, but none worth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, till <hi>Carola Bennet</hi> arrived. She did ſurprize me. Her mind and body were very wonderful, and I imagine a deſcription of her, and her ſtory afterward will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to my readers.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola Bennet.</hi>
                  </note>§. 3. <hi>Carola Bennet</hi> was at this time in the two and twentieth year of her age, a dazzling beauty in the height of life and vigour. Her eyes were black and amazingly fine: Her mouth charming: Her neck and breaſt very
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0028500202:400"/>beautiful: Her ſtature was juſt what it ought to be. She had a glow of health, a luſcious air, and a bewitching vivacity: Her manners were wonderfully winning, and the tone of her voice ſo ſweet and inſinuating, that her words and looks went directly to the heart. She had read many books of gaiety, wit, and humour; eſpecially the French; and talked delightfully on ſuch ſubjects. She ſang to perfection: but her converſation was too free, and ſhe ſeemed to have no ſenſe of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It was a fine entertainment to be in her company, as I often was, yet I could not help ſighing, to ſee ſo many any perfections on the brink of everlaſting deſtruction.—This young lady all of a ſudden diſappeared. <hi>Curl</hi> knew not what was become of her: but as I rid ten years after through <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> in the fineſt part of that romantic county, I ſaw her one morning, (as I ſtopped to water my horſe in a brook that ran from a park,) ſitting on a ſeat, under a vaſt beautiful cedar tree, with a book in her hand. I thought I was no ſtranger to the fine face, and as I was pretty near to her, I called out, and aſked, if ſhe was not Miſs <hi>Bennet?</hi> She knew me at once, and pointing to a gate that was only latched, deſired I would come to her. I went and found ſhe was the miſtreſs of the fine ſeat at a ſmall diſtance off. She brought me into the houſe, would not ſuffer me to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0028500202:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtir that day, and told me the ſtory of her life. I think it worth placing here.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory of Miſs <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</hi>
                  </note>§. 4. <hi>Carola Bennet</hi> was the daughter of <hi>John Bennet,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> gentleman, who died when ſhe was in her 19th year, and left her in the care of her aunt, an old lady who was outwardly all ſaint, and within a devil. This <hi>Carola</hi> knew well, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted her father to get another guardian for her, or leave her to manage herſelf; for Mrs. <hi>Hunfleet,</hi> her aunt, was far from being that primitive chriſtian he took her for, and ſo great a miſer, that excluſive of all her other vices, her avarice alone was enough to ruin her niece. She would ſacrifice the whole human race for half a thouſand pounds. But all his daughter ſaid was in vain. He believed his ſiſter was godlineſs itſelf, in its utmoſt latitude and extent; that ſhe lived a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued oppoſition to our mortal enemies, the world, ſin, and the devil; and that her heart was a mere magazine of univerſal honeſty, probity of manners, and goodneſs of life and converſation. Integrity and rectitude, and benevolence, as he thought, were the bright criterions of her ſoul. She will teach you, <hi>Carola,</hi> to faſt and pray, and make you like herſelf, a mere ſaint.</p>
               <p>It was to no purpoſe then for the daughter to remonſtrate: She could only weep, as her
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0028500202:402"/>father was poſitive, and after his death was obliged to go home with Mrs. <hi>Hunfleet.</hi> There, as ſhe expected, ſhe had too much of the outward bodily exerciſe of religion, every thing that can be named within the circle of external worſhip; ſuch as public and private ſervices, faſtings, macerations, bowings, expanded hands and lifted eyes, which Lord <hi>Halifax</hi> (in his advice to a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,) calls the <hi>holy goggle:</hi> but that all this accompanied the internal acts of the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's mind, and went along with her heart and ſoul, <hi>Carola</hi> had reaſon to doubt. She ſaw it was but outward profeſſion, — all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, — that her life belied her creed, and her practice was a renunciation of the chriſtian religion. This appeared to be the caſe very quickly. The aunt ſold her to one <hi>Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupe</hi> for five hundred pounds. Under pretence of taking her to viſit a friend, ſhe brought her to a private <hi>bagnio,</hi> or one of thoſe houſes called <hi>convents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>London</hi> convent: and an adventure there.</note>§. 5. Such houſes ſtand in back courts, narrow lanes, or the moſt private places, and ſeem to be uninhabited, as the front windows are ſeldom opened, or like ſome little <hi>friary,</hi> where a company of viſionaries reſide; but within are elegantly furniſhed, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the beſt wines. The woman who keeps the houſe is the only perſon to be
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0028500202:403"/>ſeen in them, unleſs it be ſometimes, that a high-priced whore, who paſſes for the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman's daughter, by accident appears.</p>
               <p>In theſe <hi>brothels</hi> the Sieur <hi>Curl</hi> was well known, and as the wine in them is always excellent, (but a ſhilling a bottle dearer than at the tavern,) and one ſits without hearing the leaſt noiſe, or being ſeen by any one, I have often gone with this ingenious man to ſuch places, on account of the purity of the wine, and the ſtillneſs of the houſe; as there are no waiters there, nor any well-dreſt huſſies to come in the way. You are as ſilent as in a cave; nor does a woman appear, except as before excepted, unleſs it be by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at this kind of <hi>meeting-houſe,</hi> as ſuch places may well be called: for there not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does many a married woman meet her gallant. One evening that I was there with <hi>Curl,</hi> there came in the wife of a very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent merchant, a lady of as excellent a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as any in the world; who was never ſo much as ſuſpected by any of her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but allowed by every body to be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of pure morals and unſpotted cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity. She came in firſt with a black maſk on her face, from her chair, and was by the woman of the houſe ſhewn into a chamber up ſtairs: Half an hour after, there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſoft tap at the door, and a gentleman was let in, who was ſhewed up to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0028500202:404"/>the lady was in: As the door of the room <hi>Curl</hi> and I were ſitting in, happened to be open as this adventurer paſſed by, I knew the man. He was an <hi>Iriſh</hi> gentleman of large fortune, with whom I was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. He was ever engaged in amours, and was ſome years after this hanged at <hi>Cork,</hi> for raviſhing <hi>Sally Squib,</hi> the quaker. His name then can be no ſecret: But as to the the lady's name, I ſhall never tell it, as ſhe left ſeveral children, who are now living in reputation; but only obſerve, that there are, to my knowledge, many women of ſuch ſtrict virtue in the world. If you aſk me reader, how I came to know who ſhe was? I will tell you. As ſhe came down ſtairs in a maſk at ten at night, in the manner ſhe went up, I concluded ſhe was a married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of diſtinction, and followed her chair, when it went off. She changed at <hi>Temple Bar,</hi> and then took a hackney coach, which drove beyond the <hi>Royal Exchange;</hi> I followed till it ſtopped at a grand houſe, into which ſhe went without a maſk, and had a full view of her fine face. I enquired next day who lived in the houſe I ſaw her go into, and was told it was Mr. *****, a merchant of the greateſt repute. Often did I ſee this lady after this, was ſeveral times in her company, and if I had not known what I did, ſhould have thought her a woman of as great vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as ever lived. There was not the leaſt
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0028500202:405"/>appearance of levity or indecency in her. To all outward appearance, ſhe was chaſtity and diſcretion in fleſh and blood. — But as to <hi>Carola Bennet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The hiſtory of Miſs <hi>Bennet</hi> continued.</note>§. 6. Soon after her aunt and ſhe arrived at Mrs. <hi>Bedewell</hi>'s, in came <hi>Cantalupe</hi> as a viſiter, and after tea, they went to cards. Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſupper, and when that was over, they gave the innocent Miſs <hi>Bennet</hi> a doſe, which deprived her of her ſenſes, put her to bed, and in the morning ſhe found herſelf ruined in the arms of that villain <hi>Cantalupe.</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction almoſt ſeized her, but he would not let her ſtir. She called, but no one came near to her relief. He ſwore a million of oaths, that it was pure love made him buy her of her aunt, as he heard ſhe was going to marry another man, and if ſhe would but ſhare with him in his great fortune, ſince the thing was done, he would, (by every ſacred power he vowed) marry her that evening or the next, the firſt time they went out, and be the trueſt and moſt tender huſband that ever yet appeared in the world. This, and the ſituation ſhe was in, naked and claſped in his ſtrong arms, without a friend to aid her, within doors or without, made her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible her reſentments were in vain, and that ſhe had better acquieſce, and make the man her huſband, if ſhe could, ſince it was her
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0028500202:406"/>hard fate, and that in all probability ſhe might conceive from the tranſactions of the night. This made her have done. She lay as he requeſted till noon, and hoped he would prove as faithful as he had ſolemnly ſwore to be.</p>
               <p>But when the night came, an indiſpoſition he feigned, made him unable to ſtir out that evening, and he requeſted the idol of his heart, whom he loved more than life, to give him leave to defer it till the next. For ſix days he put it off in the ſame manner, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time, they never ſtirred out of the bagnio, and the ſeventh day he left her faſt aſleep in bed. A billet-doux on the dreſſing-table informed her, that he was obliged to ſet out that morning for <hi>France,</hi> and as he intended to be back in a few months, he hoped ſhe would not think him faithleſs at once. He left her a hundred pound bank note, which was all he had then to ſpare, as he had paid to her aunt 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> a few days before.</p>
               <p>Thus fell the beautiful Miſs <hi>Bennet</hi> by the treachery of her ever-curſed aunt, and was made a whore very much againſt her will. The aunt, in the mean time, had ſhut up her houſe, and was gone no one knew where. She took ſeveral jewels with her, and a large ſum of money, both the property of her niece. She left her but little of her fortune, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0028500202:407"/>every where, that <hi>Carola</hi> was gone into keeping with a great man, and had before been debauched by her footman. In ſhort, all that could be done this woman did, to impoveriſh and defame her niece, and as ſhe had paſſed upon the world for a praying vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous old piece, her reports were thought ſo true, that all the female acquaintance Miſs <hi>Bennet</hi> had, laughed at the ſtory ſhe told, and ſhunned her as a foul fiend. She was baniſhed from all modeſt company. They conſidered her as the moſt deteſtable proſtitute, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing herſelf (they ſaid) by blackning the character of ſo pious and upright a woman as Mrs. <hi>Hunfleet,</hi> her aunt, was.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A reflexion on hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</note>§. 7. Thus did iniquity ruin and triumph over innocence in the maſk of religion, and a thouſand times, to my own knowledge, it has done the ſame thing. I have often known wretches pretend to ſeek the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, in the firſt place, and by believing all the monks have invented, by conſtantly attending public worſhip, and an unnatural kind of ſobriety, paſs for people that were ready and willing to ſuffer every thing the cauſe of God and truth can require from rationals: yet theſe holy mortals could make the ſervice of God not only ſtand with unwilling infirmities, (the common caſe of the beſt humanity,) but conſiſt with wilful
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0028500202:408"/>and preſumptuous ſinning, and a malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as great as the devil had againſt our firſt parents. A miniſter of the goſpel, who paſſed for an admirable man, did his beſt to ruin my character for ever with my father. One of the holieſt men in the world, cheated me of a thouſand pounds, left in his hands for my uſe, for fear I ſhould ſpend it myſelf. And a rich man, commonly called piety and goodneſs, from the ſeeming ſimplicity of his manners, the ſoftneſs of his temper, and the holy goggle of his eyes in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic devotion, arreſted me on a note of hand, one third of which was intereſt thrown into the principal, and made me pay intereſt upon intereſt, without mercy, or waiting as I in-treated, till it was more convenient. Many more ſuch praying, ſanctified villains I could mention, in reſpect of whom <hi>Edmund Curl</hi> was a cherubim, fond as he was of a girl and a flaſk. <hi>Curl</hi> owned he was a ſinner, and that he was led by thirſt and repletion to indulge: but the <hi>hypocrites</hi> with profeſſions of eſteem for the <hi>pearl of great price,</hi> and that they have parted with their <hi>Herodias,</hi> for the ſake of eternal life; yet wilfully diſobey from a paſſion for ſubſtance; and the ſhrine of bright Mammon in this world, has a greater influence on their ſouls than all the joys of an everlaſting heaven to come. What they <hi>do</hi> is a farce. Upon what they <hi>have,</hi> they reſt their all.</p>

But as to Miſs <hi>Bennet:</hi> In this ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe ſecreted herſelf for ſome months from the world, and notwithſtanding her conſtitution and taſte, intended to retire among the mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> and live upon the little ſhe had left: but unfortunately for ſo good a deſign, the matchleſs Sir <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric Dancer</hi> came in her way, and by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the force of love, perſuaded her to be his companion while he lived, which was but for a ſhort time. A young nobleman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on her next, by high rewards, to be the delight of his life for a time; and at his death, ſhe went to the arms of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> peer. She had what money ſhe pleaſed from theſe great men, and being now very rich, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, on the marriage of her laſt Lord, to go into keeping no more, but to live a gay life among the agreeable and grand. She had loſt all her notions of a <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth</hi> to come, in the converſation of theſe atheiſtical men, and on account of her living as happily as ſhe could in this world. What religion ſhe had remaining, was placed in giving money to the ſick and poor, which ſhe did with a liberal hand: And her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in all its charms, ſhe often ſhewed to the moſt deſerving men. Thoſe who had much of this world's goods paid dear: but ſhe had compaſſion on the worthy, though they could not drive in a chariot to her door.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0028500202:410"/>This was the caſe of Miſs <hi>Bennet,</hi> when I ſaw her at <hi>Curl</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>But all of a ſudden ſhe diſappeared, and no one could tell what was become of her: that I learned from herſelf, when I chanced to ſee her under the cedar tree, (as before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) in the park.</p>
               <p>A young clergyman, Mr. <hi>Tench,</hi> an Iriſhman of the county of <hi>Galway,</hi> who was very rich, and had a fine ſeat in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> ſaw her at the opera, and fell in love with her. He ſoon found out who ſhe was, waited upon her, and offered to marry her, if ſhe would reform. At firſt, ſhe ſhewed very little inclination to a virtuous courſe, and, as her manner was, ridiculed the intereſt of another life. The bleſſedneſs of heaven ſhe laughed at, and made a jeſt of riches, honours, and pleaſures to be found on the other ſide the grave. This did not however diſhearten <hi>Tench.</hi> He was a ſcholar and a man of ſenſe, and as he loved moſt paſſionately, and ſaw ſhe had a fine capacity, he was reſolved, if poſſible, to reclaim her, by applying to her bright underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tench</hi>'s converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Miſs <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to religion.</note>§. 8. He obſerved to her, in the firſt place, (as ſhe informed me) that, excluſive of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs, godlineſs was profitable in all things, that is, even in this life, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and adverſity, in plenty and in want, in peace and in war, in confuſion and ſecurity,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0028500202:411"/>in health, in honour and diſgrace, in life and in death, and in what condition ſoever we may be. This he proved to her ſatisfaction, and made it plain to her conception, that by it only we can acquire a right judgment of perſons and things, and have a juſt and due eſtimate of ourſelves: that unleſs held in by <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi> pleaſure, though innocent of itſelf, becomes a thing of deadly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to mortals; and if we do not uſe it in due time, place, circumſtance, meaſure and limits, it neceſſarily involves us in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and troubles, pain and infamy: if we ſtifle the grand leading principles, <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi> by ſin and vice, and let deſire and inclination range beyond bounds, we muſt not only plunge into various woes in this world, but as creatures degenerated below the beaſt, become the contempt and abhorrence of the wiſe and honeſt. To this ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be annexed a reflective miſery, as we have conſcience or reaſon, that will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, now and then, the whole procedure of life, do all we can to prevent it, and the remorſe that muſt enſue, on account of our wretched and ridiculous conduct, is too bitter a thing for a reaſonable creature to acquire, for the ſake of illicit gratification only; and this becomes the more grievous in reflexion, as pleaſures are not forbidden by religion, but allowed to the moſt upright, and ordained
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0028500202:412"/>for the holy ſervice of God; to recruit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and enliven the ſpirits; to propagate the human ſpecies, and preſerve the flame of love in the married ſtate. If there was then no other life but this, it is moſt certainly our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in regard to fame and advantage, to be governed by reaſon and religion.</p>
               <p>And if we are not to be annihilated with the beaſt, but are to anſwer hereafter for what we have done, whether it be good or bad, ſurely the main buſineſs of life ſhould be to govern ourſelves by godlineſs, that is, to be chriſtians in our principles, holy in our converſation, and upright in our behaviour. If the goſpel be true, (as has been proved a thouſand and a thouſand times, by the wiſeſt men in the world, to the confuſion and ſilence of infidelity,) and the Son of God came into the world, not to make <hi>Judea</hi> the ſeat of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and univerſal empire, and eſtabliſh a temporal dominion in all poſſible pomp and magnificence, (as the <hi>Jews</hi> moſt erroneouſly and ridiculouſly fancied, and to this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,) but to prepare greater things for us; to relieve us from the power of ſin, and the endleſs and unſpeakable miſeries of the life which is to come; to propoſe a prize far more worthy of our expectations than the glories of civil power, and to ſecure to us the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs both of ſoul and body to all eternity, in the kingdom of God; then certainly, in
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0028500202:413"/>regard to ourſelves, we ought to attend to his heavenly leſſons, and turn from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful enjoyments of this life, to the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſolid happineſs of a future ſtate. As this is the caſe, we ſhould cheriſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a faith of inviſible things, by ſerious and impartial conſideration. We ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the evidence which God has given us for the truth of chriſtianity, evidence very cogent and ſufficient; and then ſhew our faith by works ſuited to the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that is, by recommending the practice of virtue, and the worſhip of one God, the Creator of the univerſe.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, Miſs <hi>Bennet,</hi> that you ſtand on the brink of death, reſurrection, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it is time to begin by ſerious and humble enquiry to arrive at a faith of ſtrength and activity; that by your eminence in all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and holineſs, you may make the glorious attempt to be greateſt in the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This will be a work worthy of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul: Nor will it hinder you from enjoying as much happineſs in this lower he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, as reaſon can deſire. For godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is profitable unto all things, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
               <p>Thus (Miſs <hi>Bennet</hi> that was, continued) did this excellent young clergyman talk to me, and by argument and reaſoning in the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0028500202:414"/>gentleſt manner, by good ſenſe and good manners; made me a convert to chriſtianity and goodneſs, He ſnatched me from the gulph of eternal perdition, and, from the realms of darkneſs, and the ſociety of devils, brought me into the kingdom of the Meſſiah. To make me as happy as it was poſſible even in this world, he married me, and landed me in this charming ſpot you found me in. For ſeven years, we lived in great happineſs, without ever ſtirring from this fine ſolitude, and ſince his death, I have had no inclination to return to the world: I have one lady for my companion, an agreeable ſenſible woman, a near relation of Mr. <hi>Tench</hi>'s, and with her, and ſome good books, and three or four agreeable neighbours, have all the felicity I care for in this world. When you ſaw me at <hi>Curl</hi>'s, I had no taſte for any thing but the <hi>comedy,</hi> the <hi>opera,</hi> and a <hi>tale</hi> of <hi>La Fontaine;</hi> but you found me with a volume of <hi>Tillotſon</hi> in my hand, under that aged and beautiful cedar, near the road; and in thoſe ſermons I now find more delight, in the ſolemn ſhade of one of thoſe fine trees, than ever I enjoyed in the gayeſt ſcenes of the world. In theſe ſweet ſilent walks I am really happy. Riches and honour are with me, yea durable riches and righteouſneſs. To the bleſſings of time, I can here add the riches of expectation and comfort, the riches of future glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0028500202:415"/>This makes me fond of this fine retreat. In contentment, peace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of mind, I now live. By hearkning to the commandments, my peace is a river.</p>
               <p>Here Mrs. <hi>Tench</hi> had done, and I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed beyond expreſſion. This charming libertine was quite changed. It was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly her wont (when I have ſat an evening with her at <hi>Curl</hi>'s,) to make a jeſt of the chriſtian ſcheme, — to laugh at the devil and his flames; her life was all pleaſure, and her ſoul all whim: but when I ſaw her laſt, ſhe was ſerious, and ſeemed to enjoy as happy a ſerenity and compoſure of mind, as ever mortal was bleſſed with. Even her eyes had acquired a more ſober light, and in the place of a wild and luſcious air, a beautiful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty appeared.</p>

                  </note>§. 9. And now to what ſhall I aſcribe this aſtoniſhing alteration? Shall I ſay with our methodiſts and other viſionaries, that it muſt be owing to immediate impulſe, and proceeded from inward impreſſion of the Spirit? No: this will not do. It was owing to be ſure, to the word (not in-ſpoken) but taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his goſpel. When her friend <hi>Tench</hi> opened the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to her, her good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding inclined her to hearken. She began to conſider: She pondered, and had a regard to the goſpel, now laid before her, by that ſenſible and excellent young clergyman. She
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0028500202:416"/>became a <hi>believer.</hi> And as the Apoſtle ſays, We can do all things through <hi>Chriſt</hi> who ſtrengthens us; that is, ſays Dr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> in one of his fine ſermons, <hi>through the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt, and through the arguments and motives of the chriſtian doctrine.</hi> Well ſaid, <hi>Hunt.</hi> It muſt be our own choice, to be ſure, to be good and virtuous. So far as men are paſſive, and are acted upon, they are not agents. Without power to do good or evil, men cannot be moral or accountable beings, and be brought into judgment, or receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Lardner,</hi> in his excellent ſermon on the power and efficacy of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s doctrine, has a fine obſervation; — Would any ſay, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of immediate and particular influences from <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, is implied in this context, where he ſays, that <hi>he is a vine,</hi> and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>branches,</hi> and that their bearing fruit depends as much upon influences from him, as the life and vigour of branches do upon the ſap derived from the root of the tree? It would be eaſy to anſwer, that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the text is a ſimilitude, not literal truth. Neither is <hi>Chriſt</hi> literally a vine, nor are his diſciples, ſtrictly ſpeaking, branches. Men have a reaſonable, intellectual nature, above animals and vegetables. They are not governed by irreſiſtible, and neceſſary, or mechanical powers. But it is ſound doctrine,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0028500202:417"/>and right principles, particularly the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which are the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that are their life, and may, and will, if attended to, powerfully enable them to promote good works, and to excell, and perſevere therein.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Two Iriſh gentlemen call upon me, and bring me to a gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing table, kept by a company of ſharpers, where I loſe all my fortune.</note>§. 10. But it is time to my own ſtory. —While I lodged at <hi>Curl</hi>'s, two Iriſh gentlemen came to ſee me, <hi>Jemmy King</hi> an attorney, and that famous maſter in chancery, who debauched <hi>Nelly Hayden,</hi> the beauty, and kept her ſeveral years. I knew theſe men were as great rakes as ever lived, and had no notion of religion; that they were devoted to pleaſure, and chaſed away every ſober thought and apprehenſion by company, by empty, vicious, and unmanly pleaſures: The voice of the monitor was loſt, in the confuſed noiſe and tumult of the paſſions: but I thought they had honour at the bottom, according to the common notion of it. I never imagined they were ſharpers, nor knew, that being ruined in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they came over to live by a gaming table. The <hi>Doctor</hi> eſpecially, I thought was above ever becoming that kind of man, as he had a large eſtate, and the beſt education; always kept good company; and to appearance, was as fine a gentleman as ever was ſeen in the world. With theſe two I dined, and after dinner, they brought me, as it were, out of curioſity, to a gaming table, they had
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0028500202:418"/>by accident diſcovered, where there was a bank kept by men of the greateſt honour, who played quite fair, and by hazarding a few guineas, I might perhaps, as they did, come off with ſome hundreds.</p>
               <p>At entring the room, I ſaw about twenty well-dreſt men ſitting round a table, on which lay a vaſt heap of gold. We all began to play, and for two or three hours, I did win ſome hundreds of pounds: the Doctor and the other cheat, his friend, ſeemed to loſe a large ſum; but before morning they won it all back from me, with a great deal more; and I not only loſt what I had got then, but, excepting a few pounds, what I was worth in the world; the thouſands I had gained by my ſeveral wives. I had ſold their eſtates, and lodged the money in my banker's hands. The villains round this table got it all, and my two Iriſhmen were not to be ſeen. They diſappeared, and left me madly playing away my all. I heard no more of them, till I was told ſeveral years after, that they were in the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> among other outlawed, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, wicked men; where they drank night and day, according to the cuſtom of the place, and lived in defiance of God and man. There theſe two <hi>advocates of impiety</hi> dwelt for ſome time, and died as they had lived; enemies to all good principles, and friends to a general corruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:0028500202:419"/>
As to the well-dreſt company round the table, they went off one by one, and left me all alone to the bitter thought, which led me to what I was ſome hours before, by what I then found myſelf to be. I was almoſt diſtracted. What had I to do with play, (I ſaid)? I wanted nothing. And now by vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, with a ſett of dice that would deceive the devil, I am undone. By ſharpers and falſe dice I have ſat to be ruined. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion numb'd my ſenſes for ſome time: and then I ſtarted, was wild, and raved.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Curl</hi>'s ſcheme to carry off an heireſs, which I did in a ſucceſsful manner.</note>§. 11. This tranſaction made me very thoughtful, and I ſat within for ſeveral days, thinking which way to turn. <hi>Curl</hi> ſaw I was perplexed, and on his aſking me if I had met with any misfortune, I told him the whole caſe; that I had but one hundred pounds left, and requeſted he would adviſe me what I had beſt do. To do juſtice to every one, <hi>Curl</hi> ſeemed deeply concerned, and after ſome ſilence, as we ſat over a bottle at a Coffee-houſe, he bid me take notice of an old gentleman, who was not far from us. That is <hi>Dunk</hi> the <hi>miſer,</hi> who lives in a wood about 20 miles off. He has one daughter, the fineſt creature in the univerſe, and who is to ſucceed to his great eſtate, whether he will or not; it being ſo ſettled at his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0028500202:420"/>but he confines her ſo much in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and uſes her ſo cruelly every way, that I believe ſhe would run away with any honeſt young fellow, who could find means to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs her. Know then (continued <hi>Curl</hi>) that I ſerve Mr. <hi>Dunk</hi> with paper, pens, ink, wax, pamphlets, and every thing he wants in my way. Once a quarter of a year, I generally go to his country-houſe with ſuch things, as he is glad to ſee me ſometimes; or if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go myſelf, I ſend them by ſome other hand. Next week I am to forward ſome things to him, and if you will take them, I will write a line by you to Miſs his daughter, recommend you to her for a huſband, as one ſhe may depend on for honour and truth. She knows I am her friend, and who can tell, but ſhe may go off with you. She will have a thouſand a year, when the wretch her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dies, if he ſhould leave his perſonal eſtate another way.</p>
               <p>This thought pleaſed me much, and at the appointed time, away I went to Mr. <hi>Dunk</hi>'s country-houſe with a wallet full of things, and delivered <hi>Curl</hi>'s letter to Miſs. As ſoon as ſhe had read it, I began my addreſs, and in the beſt manner I could, made her an offer of my ſervice, to deliver her from the tyrant her father. I gave her an account of a little farm I had on the borders of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> a purchaſe I had made, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0028500202:421"/>of the charms of the ground, and a ſmall pretty lodge which ſtood in the middle of it, by a clump of old trees, near a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring ſtream; that if ſhe pleaſed, I would take her to that ſweet, ſilent ſpot, and enable her to live in peace; with contentment and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mind; tho' far away from the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and honours of the world: and conſidering, that a chriſtian is not to conform to the world, or to the pomps and vanities of it; its grand cuſtoms and uſages; its dreſs and entries; its ſtage repreſentations and maſquerades, as they miniſter to vice, and tend to debauch the manners; but are to look upon ourſelves as beings of another world, and to form our minds with theſe ſpiritual principles; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows then, I think, that a pleaſing country ſituation for a happy pair muſt be grateful enough. There peace and love and modeſty may be beſt preſerved; the truth and gravity of our religion be ſtrictly maintained; and every lawful and innocent enjoyment be for ever the delights of life. Away from the idle modes of the world; perpetual love and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed joys may be our portion, through the whole of our exiſtence here; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principles of the heart be ever laudable and pure. So will our happineſs as mortals be ſtable,—ſubject to no mixture or change; and when called away from this lower hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, have nothing to fear, as <hi>we uſed this
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0028500202:422"/>world,</hi> as <hi>tho' we uſed it not;</hi> as we knew no gratifications and liberties but what our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion allows us: as our enjoyments will be but the neceſſary convenience and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, for paſſing from this world to the realms of eternal happineſs: Follow me then, Miſs <hi>Dunk;</hi> I will convey you to a ſcene of ſtill life and felicity, great and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the heart of woman can wiſh for.</p>
               <p>The charming <hi>Agnes</hi> ſeemed not a little ſurprized at what I had ſaid, and after look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at me very earneſtly for a minute or two, told me, ſhe would give me an anſwer to Mr. <hi>Curl</hi>'s letter in leſs than half an hour, which was all ſhe could ſay at preſent, and with it I returned to give him an account of the reception I had. It will do, he ſaid, after he had read the letter I brought him from Miſs <hi>Dunk,</hi> but you muſt be my young man for a week or two more, and take ſome more things to the ſame place.

                  <hi>Agnes</hi> in her perſon was neither tall nor thin, but almoſt both, young and lovely, graceful and commanding: She inſpired a reſpect, and compelled the beholder to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and love and reverence her. Her voice was melodious; her words quite charming; and every look and motion to her advantage. Taſte was the characteriſtic of her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: Her ſentiments were refined: And a ſenſibility appeared in every feature of her face. She could talk on various ſubjects, and comprehended them, which is what few ſpeakers do: but with the fineſt diſcernment, ſhe was timid, and ſo diffident of her opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſhe often concealed the fineſt thoughts under a ſeeming ſimplicity of ſoul.

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0028500202:425"/>appeared unconſcious of it, and never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the leaſt pride or precipitancy in her converſation.—Her manner was perfectly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, and mixed with a gaiety that charmed, becauſe it was as free from reſtraint as from boldneſs.</p>
               <p>In ſum, excluſive of her fine underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in her dreſs, and in her behaviour, ſhe was ſo extremely pleaſing, ſo vaſtly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and delightful, that ſhe ever brought to my remembrance, when I beheld her, the <hi>Corinna</hi> deſcribed in the beautiful lines of <hi>Tibullus:</hi>

Such was the beautiful <hi>Agnes,</hi> who went off with me, and in ſo doing acted well and wiſely, I affirm, on her taking me only for an honeſt man; for there is no more obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due from a daughter to her father, when he becomes an unrelenting oppreſſor, than there is from a ſubject to an Engliſh king, when the monarch acts contrary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Paſſive obedience is as much non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe in a private family, as in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the prince. The parent, like the king, muſt be a nurſing father, a rational humane ſovereign, and ſo long all ſervice and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are due. But if, like the prince, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a tyrant, deprives his daughter of her natural rights and liberties; will not allow her the bleſſings of life, but keep her in chains and miſery; ſelf-preſervation, and her juſt claim to the comforts of exiſtence and a rational freedom, give her a right to change her ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and better her condition. If ſhe can have bread, ſerenity, and freedom, peace and little, with an honeſt man, ſhe is juſt to herſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elf in going off with ſuch a deliverer. Reaſon and revelation will acquit her.</p>
               <p>Thus juſtly thought Miſs <hi>Dunk,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with me ſhe fled at midnight. We met within half a mile of her father's houſe, by the ſide of an antient wood, and a running ſtream, which had a pleaſing effect, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be a bright moonſhine. With her
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0028500202:427"/>foot in my hand, I lifted her into her ſaddle, and as our horſes were excellent, we rid many miles in a few hours. By eight in the morning, we were out of the reach of old <hi>Dunk,</hi> and at the ſign of the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> a lone houſe in <hi>Eſur-vale,</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> we break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted very joyfully. The charming <hi>Agnes</hi> ſeemed well pleaſed with the expedition, and ſaid a thouſand things that rendered the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney delightful. Twelve days we travelled in a fulneſs of delights, happy beyond deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the thirteenth arrived at a village not far from my little habitation. Here we deſigned to be married two days after, when we had reſted, as there was a church and a parſon in the town, and then ride on to <hi>Foley</hi> farm in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> as my ſmall ſpot was called, and there ſit down in peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>But the ſecond day, inſtead of riſing to the nuptial ceremony, to crown my life with unutterable bliſs, and make me beyond all mankind happy, the lovely <hi>Agnes</hi> fell ill of a fever. A ſenſe of weight and oppreſſion diſcovered the inflammation within, and was attended with ſharp and pungent pains. The blood could not paſs off as it ought in the courſe of circulation, and the whole maſs was in a violent fluctuation and motion. In a word, ſhe died in a few days, and as ſhe had requeſted, if it came to that, I laid her
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0028500202:428"/>out, and put her into the coffin myſelf. I kept her ſeven days, according to the cuſtom of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> and then in the dreſs of ſorrow, followed her to the grave.—Thus was my plan of happineſs broken to pieces. I had given a roundneſs to a ſyſtem of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and in the place of it, ſaw death and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and diſappointment before me.</p>
               <p>What to do next I could not tell. One queſtion was, ſhould I return to <hi>Orton-lodge,</hi> to my two young heireſſes? No: they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two years of being at age.—Then, ſhall I ſtay at <hi>Foley-farm</hi> where I was, and turn hermit? No: I had no inclination yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a father of the deſarts.—Will you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>London</hi> then, and ſee if fortune has any thing more in reſerve for you? This I liked beſt; and after ſix months deliberation on the thing, I left my farm in the care of an old woman, and ſet out in the beginning of <hi>January.</hi>

                  </note>§. 13. It was as fine a winter's morning as I had ſeen, which encouraged me to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture among the <hi>Fells</hi> of <hi>Weſtmoreland;</hi> but at noon the weather changed, and an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very terrible came on. A little after three, it began to blow, rain, and ſnow very hard, and it was not long before it was very dark. We loſt the way quite, and for three hours wandered about in as diſmal a night as ever
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0028500202:429"/>poor travellers had. The ſtorm rattled: The tempeſt howled: We could not ſee the horſe's heads, and were almoſt dead with cold. We had nothing to expect but death, as we knew not which way to turn to any houſe, and it was impoſſible to remain alive till the day appeared. It was a diſmal ſcene. But my time was not yet come, and when we had no ground to expect deliverance, the beaſts of a ſudden ſtopt, and <hi>Soto</hi> found we were at the gate of a walled yard. There he immediately made all the noiſe he could, and it was not long before a ſervant with a lantern came. He related our caſe within, and had orders to admit us. He brought me into a common parlour, where there was a good fire, and I got dry things. The man brought me half a pint of hot alicant, and in about half an hour, I was alive and well again. On enquiring where I was, the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told me, it was Doctor <hi>Stanvil</hi>'s houſe; that his maſter and lady were above in the dining-room, with ſome company, and he had directions to light me up, when I had changed my cloaths, and was recovered. Upon this I told him I was ready, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him.</p>

I would take my oath of it in a court of juſtice, if there was occaſion for that. However ſhe got out of the grave, and by

This has aſtoniſhed me, as I ſtood behind your chair at ſupper, looking full at her; and I obſerved ſhe looked at me once or twice. What to ſay to all this, I know not; but I will make all the enquiry I can among the ſervants, as to the time and manner of her coming here, and let you know to-morrow, what I have been able to collect in relation to her. In the mean time, be advis'd by me, Sir, tho' I am but a poor fellow, and think no more of the matter to the loſs of your night's reſt. We have had a wonderful deliverance from death by getting into this houſe, I am ſure, and we ought to lie down with thankfulneſs and joy, without fretting ourſelves awake for a woman, or any trifling incident that could befall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſhe is now another man's property, however it came to paſs, and it would be inconſiſtent with your character to think any more of her. This may be too free; but I hope, Sir, you will excuſe it in a ſervant who has your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and welfare at heart. — Here the ſage <hi>Finn</hi> had done.

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0028500202:434"/>ſoon after, and looking up to the head ſaw the eyes open and ſhut again: that upon this, he laid down his knife, which had but juſt ſcratch'd the body, at the beginning of the <hi>linea alba,</hi> (as my informer called it) and helped himſelf to put it into a warm bed: that he took all poſſible pains, by admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering every thing he could think uſeful, to reſtore life, and was ſo fortunate as to ſet one of the fineſt women in the world on her feet again. As ſhe had no raiment but the ſhroud which had been on her in the coffin, he got every thing belonging to dreſs that a woman of diſtinction could have occaſion for, and in a few days time, ſhe ſparkled before her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver in the brightneſs of an Eaſtern princeſs: He was quite charmed with the beauties of her perſon, and could not enough admire her uncommon underſtanding: He offered to marry her, to ſettle largely on her, and as ſhe was a ſingle woman, ſhe could not in gratitude refuſe the requeſt of ſo generous a benefactor: My informer further related, that they have both lived in the greateſt happineſs ever ſince; and the doctor, who is one of the beſt of men, is continually ſtudying how to add to the felicities of her every day: that he offered to take her up to <hi>London</hi> to paſs the winters there, but this ſhe refuſed, and deſired ſhe might remain where ſhe was in the country, as it was really moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

                  </note>This account made the thing quite plain to me. And to judge impartially, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole caſe, I could neither blame the lovely <hi>Agnes</hi> for marrying the doctor, nor condemn her for pretending to be a ſtranger to me. She was fairly dead and buried, and all connexion between us was at an end of courſe, as there had been no marriage, nor contract of marriage. And as to reviving the affair, and renewing the tenderneſs which had exiſted, it could anſwer no other end than producing unhappineſs, as ſhe was then Mrs. <hi>Stanvil,</hi> in a decent and happy ſituation. And further, in reſpect of her marrying the doctor ſo ſoon after her ſeparation from me, it was certainly the wiſeſt thing ſhe could do, as ſhe had been ſo intirely at his diſpoſal, was without a ſtitch to cover her, and I in all probability, after burying her, being gone up to <hi>London,</hi> or in ſome place, where ſhe could never hear of me more; I might likewiſe have been married, if any thing advantageous had offered after laying her in the church-yard. And beſide, ſhe neither knew the place ſhe fell ſick in, nor the country the doctor removed her to, as ſoon as ever he could get any cloaths to put on her. So that, naked and friendleſs as ſhe was, without any money, and ignorant of
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0028500202:436"/>what became of me; without a poſſibility of informing herſelf; I could not but acquit her. I even admired her conduct, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſo far to imitate her, in regard to the general happineſs, that nothing ſhould appear in my behaviour, which could incline any one to think, I had ever ſeen her before the night the tempeſt drove me to her houſe. I was vexed, I own, to loſe her. But that could be no reaſon for making a ſenſeleſs uproar, that could do nothing but miſchief.</p>
               <p>As compoſed then as I could be, I went down to breakfaſt, on a ſervant's letting me know they waited for me, and found the ſame company, who had ſo lately parted to ſlumber, all quite alive and chearful, eaſy and happy as mortals could be. At the requeſt of Dr. <hi>Stanvil,</hi> who was extremely civil, I ſtaid with them two months, and paſſed the time in a delightful converſation, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with muſic, cards, and feaſting.<note place="margin">My depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Dr. <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>'s houſe.</note> With ſadneſs I left them all, but eſpecially on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of parting for ever with the late Miſs <hi>Dunk.</hi> It was indeed for the pleaſure of looking at her, that I ſtaid ſo long as I did at Dr. <hi>Stanvil</hi>'s; and when it came to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſeparation, I felt that morning of my departure, an inward diſtreſs it is impoſſible to give an idea of to another. It had ſome reſemblance (I imagine) of what the viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries call a dereliction; when they ſink from

It is not eaſy to believe, that after I ſeemed certain ſhe was dead, and kept her the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per number of days before interment; ſaw her lie the cold wan ſubject for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, and then let down into the grave; yet from thence ſhe ſhould come forth, and now be the deſire of a huſband's eyes. This is a hard account ſure. But nevertheleſs, it is a fact. As to my being miſtaken, no leſs a man than Dr. <hi>Cheyne</hi> thought Colonel <hi>Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend</hi> dead: (See his <hi>Nervous Caſes:</hi>) And that ſeveral have lived for many years, after they had been laid in the tomb, is a thing too certain, and well-known, to be denied. In <hi>Bayle</hi>'s dictionary, there is the hiſtory of a lady of quality, belonging to the court of <hi>Catharine de Medicis,</hi> who was brought from the church vault, where ſhe had been forty-eight hours, and afterwards became the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſeveral children, on her marriage with the Marquis <hi>D'Auvergne.</hi>—The learned Dr. <hi>Connor,</hi> in his hiſtory of <hi>Poland,</hi> gives us a very wonderful relation of a gentleman's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0028500202:438"/>in that country, after he had been ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly dead for near a fortnight; and adds a very curious diſſertation on the nature of ſuch reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. The caſe of <hi>Dun Scotus,</hi> who was found out of his coffin, on the ſteps going down to the vault he was depoſited in, and leaning on his elbow, is full to my purpoſe. And I can affirm from my own knowledge, that a gentleman of my acquaintance, a worthy excellent man, was buried alive, and found not only much bruiſed and torn, on opening his coffin, but turned on one ſide. This many ſtill living can atteſt as well as I. The reaſon of opening the grave again, was his dying of a high fever in the abſence of his lady, who was in a diſtant county from him; and on her return, three days after he was buried, would have a ſight of him, as ſhe had been extremely fond of him. His face was ſadly broke, and his hands hurt in ſtriving to force up the lid of the coffin. The lady was ſo affected with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſight, that ſhe never held up her head af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and died in a few weeks. I could likewiſe add another extraordinary caſe of a man who was hang'd, and to all appearance was quite dead, yet three days after his execution reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as they were going to cut him up. —How theſe things happen, is not eaſy to account for; but happen they do ſometimes.

                  <note place="margin">A reflexion as I rid from Dr. <hi>Stanvil</hi>'s houſe.</note>§. 1. WITH this advice of the <hi>genius</hi> in my head, (which by chance I had read the morning I took my leave of Dr. <hi>Stanvil,</hi>) I ſet out, as I had reſolved, for <hi>York,</hi> and deſign'd to go from thence to <hi>London;</hi> hoping to meet with ſomething good, and purpoſing, if it was poſſible, to be no longer the <hi>Rover,</hi> but turn to ſomething uſeful, and fix. I had loſt almoſt all at the gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-table, (as related) and had not thirty pounds of my laſt hundred remaining: This, with a few ſheep, cows and horſes at <hi>Orton-lodge,</hi> and a very ſmall ſtock at my little farm, on the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0028500202:444"/>borders of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> was all I had left. It made me very ſerious, and brought ſome diſmal apprehenſions in view: But I did not deſpair. As my heart was honeſt, I ſtill truſted in the providence of God, and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of things is this world. As the infinite power and wiſdom of the Creator was evident, from a ſurvey of this magnificent and glorious ſcene; — as his care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over each particular, in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the great ſcheme was conſpicuous; can man, the favourite of heaven, have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to lift up his voice to complain, if he calls off his affections from folly, and by natural and ſupernatural force, by reaſon and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, overbears the prejudices of fleſh and blood;—if he ponders the hopes and fears of religion,—and gives a juſt allowance to a future intereſt? <hi>Hearken to the commandments,</hi> (ſaith the Lord,) <hi>and your peace ſhall be as a river.</hi>

                     <p>In <hi>Claude</hi>'s reply to <hi>Arnaud,</hi> the French papiſt, we are told it was the humour of the <hi>Prince of Condé,</hi> to have a <hi>man of wood</hi> on horſe-back, dreſt like a field-officer, with a lifted broad ſword in its hand; which figure was faſtened in the great ſaddle, and the horſe it was on always kept by the great <hi>Condé</hi>'s ſide, when he travelled or engaged in the bloody field. Fearleſs
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0028500202:445"/>the man of <hi>wood</hi> appeared in many a well-fought day; but as they purſued the enemy one afternoon through a foreſt, in riding hard, a bough knocked off the wooden warrior's head; yet ſtill he galloped on after flying foes, to the amazement of the enemy, who ſaw a <hi>hero</hi> purſuing without a head. <hi>Claude</hi> applies this image to popery.</p>

                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:0028500202:444"/>and hoped at the end of every
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0028500202:445"/>mile to meet with ſomething fortunate; but nothing extraordinary occurred till the ſecond evening, when I arrived at a little lone pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic-houſe, on the ſide of a great heath, by the entrance of a wood. For an hour before I came to this reſting-place, I had rid in a tempeſt of wind, rain, lightning and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo very violent, that it brought to my remembrance old <hi>Heſiod</hi>'s deſcription of a ſtorm.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then <hi>Jove</hi> omnipotent diſplay'd the god,</l>
                  <l>And all <hi>Olympus</hi> trembled as he trod:</l>
                  <l>He graſps ten thouſand thunders in his hand,</l>
                  <l>Bares his red arm, and wields the forky brand;</l>
                  <l>Then aims the bolts, and bids his lightnings play,</l>
                  <l>They flaſh, and rend thro' heav'n their flaming way:</l>
                  <l>Redoubling blow on blow, in wrath he moves,</l>
                  <l>The ſing'd earth groans, and burns with all her groves:</l>
                  <l>A night of clouds blots out the golden day,</l>
                  <l>Full in their eyes the writhen lightnings play:</l>
                  <l>Nor ſlept the wind; the wind new horror forms,</l>
                  <l>Clouds daſh on clouds before th' outragious ſtorms;</l>
                  <l>While tearing up the ſands, in drifts they riſe,</l>
                  <l>And half the deſarts mount th' encumber'd ſkies:</l>
                  <l>At once the tempeſt bellows, lightnings fly,</l>
                  <l>The thunders roar, and clouds involve the ſky.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>It was a dreadful evening upon a heath, and ſo much as a buſh was not to be met
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:0028500202:446"/>with for ſhelter: but at laſt we came to the thatched habitation of a publican, and I thought it a very comfortable place: We had bread and bacon, and good ale for ſupper, and in our circumſtances, it ſeemed a delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meal.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of an old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of his, who lived not far from the inn he arrived at.</note>§. 3. This man informed me, that about a mile from his habitation, in the middle of the wood, there dwelt an <hi>old phyſician,</hi> one Dr. <hi>Fitzgibbons,</hi> an Iriſh gentleman, who had one very pretty daughter, a ſenſible wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to whom he was able to give a good fortune, if a man to both their liking ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; but as no ſuch one had as yet come in their way, my landlord adviſed me to try the adventure, and he would furniſh me with an excuſe for going to the doctor's houſe. This ſet me a thinking: Dr. <hi>Fitzgibbons,</hi> an Iriſh gentleman, I ſaid: I know the man. I ſaved his ſon's life, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when he was upon the brink of deſtruction, and the old gentleman was not only then as thankful as it was poſſible for a man to be, in return for the good I had done him, at the hazard of my own life; but aſſured me, a thouſand times over, that if ever it was in his power to return my kindneſs, he would be my friend to the utmoſt of his ability. He muſt ever remember, with the greateſt gratitude, the benefit I had
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:0028500202:447"/>ſo generouſly conferred on him and his. All this came full into my mind, and I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to viſit the old gentleman in the morning.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Next day, as I had reſolved, I went to pay my reſpects to Dr. <hi>Fitzgibbons,</hi> who remembered me perfectly well, was moſt heartily glad to ſee me, and received me in the moſt affectionate manner. He immediately began to repeat his obligations to me, for the deliverance I had given his ſon, and that if it was in his power to be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me in <hi>England,</hi> he would leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing undone that was poſſible for him to do, to befriend me.<note n="(19)" place="bottom">
                     <p>The caſe was this. As I was returning one ſummer's evening from <hi>Tallow-Hills,</hi> where I had been to ſee a young lady, (mentioned in the beginning of my firſt volume,) I ſaw in a <hi>deep glen</hi> before me two men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; a black of an enormous ſize, who fought with one of thoſe large broad ſwords which they call in <hi>Ireland, Andrew Ferraro;</hi> and a little thin man with a drawn rapier. The <hi>white</hi> man I perceived was no match for the <hi>black,</hi> and muſt have periſhed very ſoon, as he had received ſeveral wounds, if I had not haſtned up to his relief. I knew him to be my acquaintance, young <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibbons,</hi> my neighbour in the ſame ſquare of the college that I lived in; and immediately drawing an excellent Spaniſh tuck I always wore, took the <hi>Moor</hi> to myſelf, <hi>Fitzgibbons</hi> not being able to ſtand any longer; and a glorious battle enſued. As I was a maſter at the ſmall ſword in thoſe days, I had the advantage of the <hi>black</hi> by my weapon, (as the broad ſword is but a poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0028500202:448"/>againſt a rapier,) and gave him three wounds for every ſlight one I received: But at laſt he cut me quite through the left collar-bone, and in return, I was in his vaſt body a moment after. This dropt the <hi>robber,</hi> who had been a trumpeter to a regiment of horſe; and <hi>Fitzgibbons</hi> and I were brought, by ſome people paſſing that way, to his father's houſe at <hi>Dolfins-barn,</hi> a village about a mile from the ſpot where this affair happened. A ſurgeon was ſent for, and we recovered in a few weeks time; but my <hi>collar-bone</hi> was much more troubleſome to me, than the wounds <hi>Fitzgibbons</hi> had were to him, tho' he loſt much more blood. This was the ground of the obligation the doctor mentioned in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with me.</p>
                  </note>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:0028500202:447"/>He told me, that
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0028500202:448"/>darling ſon of his, whoſe life I had ſaved, was an eminent phyſician at the court of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> where he lived in the greateſt opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and reputation: and as he owed his exiſtence as ſuch to me, his father could never be grateful enough in return. Can I any way ſerve you, Sir? Have you been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate or unfortunate, ſince your living in <hi>England?</hi> Are you married or unmarried? I have a daughter by a ſecond wife, and if you are not yet engaged, will give her to you, with a good fortune, and in two years time; if you will ſtudy phyſic here, under my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, will enable you to begin to practice, and get money as I have done in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I have ſo true a ſenſe of that generous act you did to ſave my ſon, that I will with pleaſure do any thing in my power that can contribute to your happineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:0028500202:449"/>
To this I replied, by thanking the doctor for his friendly offers, and letting him know, that ſince my coming to <hi>England</hi> ſeveral years ago, which was occaſioned by a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my father and me; I had met with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral turns of fortune, good and bad, and was at preſent but in a very middling way; having only a little ſpot among the mountains of <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> with a cottage and garden on it, and three or four beaſts, which I found by accident without an owner, as I travelled through that uninhabited land; and a ſmall farm of fifty acres with ſome ſtock, on the borders of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> which I got by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed wife. This, with about fifty guineas in my purſe, was my all at preſent; and I was going up to <hi>London,</hi> to try if I could meet with any thing fortunate in that place; but that, ſince he was pleaſed to make me ſuch generous offers, I would ſtop, ſtudy phyſic as he propoſed, and accept the great honour he did me in offering me his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a wife. I told him likewiſe very fairly and honeſtly, that I had been rich by three or four marriages ſince my being in this country; but that I was unfortunately taken in at a gaming-table, by the means of two Iriſh gentlemen he knew very well, and there loſt all; which vext me the more, as I really do not love play:—that as to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I had little to expect from him, tho'

I have not writ to him ſince my being in <hi>England:</hi> Nor have I met with any one who could give me any account of the family. This is my caſe, Sir.</p>
               <p>And what (Dr. <hi>Fitzgibbons</hi> ſaid) is this fine religious diſpute, which has made your father fall out with a ſon he was once ſo fond of?—It was about <hi>trinity in unity,</hi> Sir: a thing I have often heard your ſon argue againſt by leſſons he had from you, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me. My father is as <hi>orthodox</hi> as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazienzen,</hi> among the antient fathers, or <hi>Trapp</hi> and <hi>Potter, Webſter</hi> and <hi>Waterland,</hi> among the modern doctors; and when he found out, that I was become an <hi>unitarian,</hi> and renounced his <hi>religion</hi> of <hi>three Gods,</hi> the horrible <hi>creed</hi> of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable explications of his admired divines, on that ſubject; — that I inſiſted, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the ſubtle inventions of learned men, through the whole chriſtian world, yet God Almighty hath not appointed himſelf to be worſhipped by precept or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in any one inſtance in his holy word,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0028500202:451"/>under the character of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; — that the worſhip of three perſons and one God is expreſly contrary to the ſolemn determination of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles;— and in numbers of inſtances in the New Teſtament it is declared, that the one God and Father of all is the only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme object, to whom all religious worſhip ſhould be directed:— that for theſe reaſons, I renounced the received doctrine of a co-equal trinity, and believed our great and learned divines, who laboured to prevent people from ſeeing the truth as it is in Jeſus, would be in ſome tribulation at Chriſt's tribunal; where they are to appear ſtripped of all worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, dignities, and preferments, poor, naked, wretched mortals, and to anſwer for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to the goſpel, in an invented <hi>hereſy</hi> of <hi>three Gods.</hi> —When my father heard theſe things, and ſaw the religious caſe of his ſon, his paſſion was very great. He forbid me his table, and ordered me to ſhift for myſelf. He renounced me, as I had done the <hi>triune God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doctor wondered not a little at the account I had given him, (as my father was reckoned a man of great abilities,) and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me by the hand, ſaid, I had acted moſt gloriouſly: that what loſt me my father's affection, was the very thing that ought to have
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0028500202:452"/>induced him to erect a ſtatue to my honour in his garden: — that ſince I was pleaſed to accept of his offer, his friendſhip I might depend on:— that if I would, I ſhould begin the next day the ſtudy of phyſic under his direction, and at the end of two years, he would give me his daughter, who was not yet quite twenty.</p>

The choice of dreſs was no part of <hi>Julia</hi>'s care, but by the neglect of it ſhe became irreſiſtible. In her countenance there ever appeared a bewitching mixture of ſenſibility and gaiety, and in her ſoul, by converſe we diſcovered that generoſity and tenderneſs were the firſt principles of her mind. To truth and virtue ſhe was inwardly devoted, and at the bottom of her heart, tho' hard to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, her main buſineſs to ſerve God, and fit herſelf for eternity. In ſum, ſhe was one of the fineſt originals that ever appeared among womankind, peculiar in perfections which cannot be deſcribed; and ſo inexpreſſibly charming in an attractive ſweetneſs, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gaiety, and a ſtriking negligence, a fine underſtanding, and the moſt humane heart; that I found it impoſſible to know her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in love with her: Her power to pleaſe was extenſive indeed.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE firſt books I got upon my table, were the <hi>lexicons</hi> of <hi>Caſtellus</hi> and <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> one for the explication of antient terms; and the other of modern. Theſe, as Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, lay at hand for uſe, when wanted.</p>
                  <p>I then opened the laſt edition of <hi>Schel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hammer</hi>'s <hi>Herman Conringius</hi>'s <hi>Introductio in univerſam artem medicam, ſingulaſque ejus partes;</hi> I ſay the laſt edition, 1726, becauſe that has an excellent preface by <hi>Hoffman.</hi> This book, which comes down to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 17th century, I read with great care; eſpecially <hi>Gonthier Chriſtopher Schelham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s notes, and additions, which have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched the work very much. (By the way, they were both very great men, and bright ornaments to their profeſſion. They writ an amazing number of books on medicine. <hi>Conringius</hi> died December 1681, aged 75. <hi>Schelhammer,</hi> in January 1716, in the 67th year of his age.)</p>
                  <p>The next introductory book to the art, was <hi>Lindenius renovatus de ſcriptis medicis,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:0028500202:456"/>quibus praemittitur manuductio ad medicinam.</hi> This book was firſt called <hi>Libro duo de ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis, &amp;c.</hi> and written by <hi>Vander Linden,</hi> a famous <hi>Leyden</hi> profeſſor, who publiſhed it in the year 1637, in a ſmall octavo. In the ſame form it was printed in 1651 and 1662: theſe three editions at <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> But the valuable edition is that of <hi>Nuremburg,</hi> 1686, by <hi>George Abraham Merklinus,</hi> who made very many and excellent additions to this fourth edition, and called it <hi>Lindenius reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus,</hi> as he had augmented it to a vaſt 4 to. <hi>John Antonides Vander Linden</hi> died in March 1664, aged 55. And <hi>Merklinus</hi> in April 1702, in the 58th year of his age. They both writ many books in phyſic: but there have been ſuch improvements made by the diligence and ſucceſs of modern phyſicians, that it would be only loſs of time to read over all their works, or all the authors of the 17th century.</p>
                  <p>The next books I opened, were the learned <hi>Daniel Le Clerc's hiſtory of phyſic,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences with the world, and ends at the time of <hi>Galen;</hi> and the great Dr. <hi>Friend</hi>'s <hi>hiſtory,</hi> which is a continuation of <hi>Le Clerc,</hi> down to <hi>Linacre,</hi> the founder of the College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. —Theſe books ſhewed me the origin and revolutions of phyſic, and the antient writers and their works on this ſubject. By the way, <hi>Daniel
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:0028500202:457"/>Le Clerc</hi> died in June 1728, aged 76, and ſome months.</p>
                  <p>When I had read theſe things,<note n="*" place="bottom">If <hi>Mangetus</hi> had publiſhed his <hi>Bibliotheca ſcriptorum medicorum,</hi> 2 vols. folio, at the time I am ſpeaking of, the Doctor, my friend, would have recommended it to a beginner.</note> I turned next to <hi>botany,</hi> and read <hi>Raii Methodus plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum emendata, Londini</hi> 1703. <hi>Raii Synopſis methodica ſtirpium,</hi> Ed. 3. And <hi>Tournefort's Inſtitutiones rei herbariae.</hi> Theſe books with a few obſervations of my own, as I walked in the gardens, the fields, and on the plains, furniſhed me with ſufficient knowledge of this kind for the preſent.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Chemiſtry</hi> was the next thing my director bid me look into, and to this purpoſe I peruſed <hi>Boerhaave</hi>'s <hi>Elementa chemiae:</hi> and <hi>Hoffman</hi>'s <hi>Obſervationes phyſico-chemiae:</hi> Theſe afford as much chemiſtry as a young phyſician need ſet out with: but as books alone give but an imperfect conception, I performed moſt of the common operations in the <hi>portable furnace of Becher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>materia medica</hi> in the next place had my attention, that is, thoſe animal, vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and foſſil ſubſtances, which are uſed to prevent, cure, or palliate diſeaſes. And in order to know the names of all the drugs,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:0028500202:458"/>their hiſtory, the adulterations they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, their virtues, their doſe, their manner of uſing them, and the cautions which they require, — to get a ſufficient knowledge of this kind, I looked into <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s <hi>materia medica,</hi> and made a collection of the <hi>materia</hi> at the ſame time, that I might conceive and remember what I read.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> or the art of preparing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding medicines, was the next thing I endeavoured to be a maſter of. And that I might know how to exalt their virtues, to obviate their ill qualities, and to make them leſs nauſeous, I read to this purpoſe, <hi>Quincy</hi>'s <hi>pharmaceutical lectures</hi> and <hi>diſpenſatory:</hi> and took care to be well verſed in all the <hi>pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoeia</hi>'s, thoſe of <hi>London, Edinburgh, Paris, Boerhaave, Bate,</hi> and <hi>Fuller.</hi> And I read very carefully <hi>Gaubin</hi>'s <hi>methodus praeſcribendi.</hi> This gave me the materials, and taught me the form of preſcribing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anatomy</hi> I ſtudied next, that is, the art of dividing the ſeveral parts of a body, ſo as to know their ſize, figure, ſituation, connexions, and make. I began with <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Keil,</hi> and then read over <hi>Winſlow.</hi> I had likewiſe open before me at the ſame time, at my entrance upon this ſtudy, a good ſet of plates, the tables of <hi>Euſtachius</hi> and <hi>Cooper,</hi> and turned them carefully over as I read. The doctor then ſhewed me how to diſſect,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:0028500202:459"/>but chiefly by the direction of a book called the <hi>Culter Anatomicus</hi> of <hi>Michel Lyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> ou methode courte, facile, &amp; claire de diſſequer les corps humaines.

                  <p>Here before I proceed, I will mention a very curious caſe, which occurred in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecting the body I have ſpoken of. It was as remarkable an example of a preternatural ſtructure as ever appeared.<note place="margin">Caſe of a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with a double vagina.</note> In cutting her up, there was found <hi>two vaginas,</hi> and a right and left <hi>uterus.</hi> Each <hi>uterus</hi> had its corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding <hi>vagina,</hi> and the <hi>uteri</hi> and the <hi>vaginae</hi> lay parallel to each other; there was only one <hi>ovarium;</hi> but two perfect <hi>hymens.</hi> The <hi>labia</hi> ſtretched ſo as to take in the <hi>anus,</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating beyond it; and as they were in large ridges, and well armed, the whole had a formidable appearance. If it ſhould be aſked, Could a perfect ſuperfoetation take place in ſuch a perſon? Moſt certainly there might be one conception upon the back of another at different times; therefore, I ſhould not chuſe to marry a woman with two <hi>vaginas,</hi> if it was poſſible to know it before wedlock.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, — The next things I read, were the <hi>Inſtitutes of Medicine,</hi> that is, ſuch books as treat of the oeconomy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:0028500202:461"/>of nature in adapting the parts to their ſeveral uſes. The books purely <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiological,</hi> are, <hi>Keil</hi>'s <hi>Tentamina. Sanctorii aphoriſmi. Bellini de pulſibus et urina. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellus de motu animalium. Harvey de motu cordis:</hi> —And <hi>de generation animalium.</hi> (two admirable pieces.) <hi>Friend</hi>'s <hi>Emmenologia. Simpſon</hi>'s Syſtem of the Womb. And <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairne</hi>'s Tracts. Theſe are the beſt things relating to <hi>phyſiology,</hi> which may be called the <hi>firſt part</hi> of the <hi>Inſtitutions of Phyſic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 2d part of the Inſtitutes is the <hi>Art of preſerving ſuch a ſyſtem as the body, in an order fit for the exerciſe of its functions as long as poſſible.</hi> The 3d part is <hi>pathology,</hi> which teaches the different manners in which diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes happen; and the various cauſes of theſe diſorders, with their attendants and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: The 4th part is the <hi>doctrine of ſigns,</hi> by which a judgment is formed of the ſound or bad ſtate of the animal: And the 5th is <hi>Therapentica,</hi> that is, the means and method of reſtoring ſanity to a diſtempered body. Treatiſes on all theſe matters, are what we call <hi>inſtitutions of phyſic,</hi> and in relation, to the four laſt mentioned, the beſt books are, <hi>Hoffman</hi>'s <hi>Syſtema medicinoe rationalis,</hi> and <hi>Boerhaave</hi>'s <hi>Inſtitutions, with his lectures upon them.</hi> Theſe books I read with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and found them ſufficient.</p>

                     <pb n="447" facs="tcp:0028500202:462"/>
Being inſtituted in this manner, I turned next to the practical writers, and read the hiſtory of diſeaſes and their cure from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of nature. This is called <hi>patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia particularis,</hi> and is the great buſineſs of a phyſician. All that has been ſaid is only preparatory to this ſtudy. Here then I firſt very carefully read the authors who have written a ſyſtem of all diſeaſes; and then, ſuch writers as have conſidered particular caſes. The beſt ſyſtem writers are <hi>Boer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haave</hi>'s <hi>aphoriſms and comment. Hoffman</hi>'s <hi>pathologia particularis;</hi> being the laſt part of his <hi>Syſtema medicinae. Jumher</hi>'s <hi>coſpectus medicinae. Allen</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis. Shaw</hi>'s <hi>Practice of phyſic;</hi> and <hi>Lomnii opuſculum aureum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The writers on a few and particular diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are, <hi>Sydenham opera. Moreton</hi>'s <hi>Puretologia. Bellini de morbis capitis et pectoris. Ramazzini de morbis artificium. Wepſemus de apoplexia. Floyer on the aſthma. Aſtruc de lue venerea. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>'s <hi>ſynopſis:</hi> And <hi>of the ſkin. Muſgrave de arthritide. Highmore de paſſione hyſterica et hypocondria. Gliſſon de rachitide. Clericus de lumbrico lato. Daventer ars obſtetricandi. Mauriceau des femmes groſſes. Harris de mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis infantium. Turner</hi>'s <hi>letter to a young phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</hi> All theſe books very carefully I read, and to your reading add the beſt obſervations you can any where get, or make yourſelf. I writ down in the ſhorteſt manner, abſtracts
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:0028500202:463"/>of the moſt curious and uſeful things, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the repreſentations of nature; and refreſhed my memory by often looking into my note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book. Every thing taken from nature is valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Hypotheſis is entertaining rather than uſeful.</p>
                  <p>And when I was reading the hiſtory of diſeaſes in the authors I have juſt mentioned, I looked into the antient Greek and Latin medical writers; for all their merit lies in this kind of hiſtory. Their pharmacy and anatomy is good for nothing. They ſcarce knew any thing of the human bodies, but from the diſſections of other animals, took their deſcriptions. The great <hi>Veſalius</hi> in the beginning of the 16th century, was the firſt that taught phyſicians to ſtudy nature in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecting human bodies; which was then conſidered by the church as a kind of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.<note n="(20)" place="bottom">
                        <p>When <hi>Veſalius</hi> began to diſſect human bodies, he was conſidered by the people as an impious cruel man; and before he could practice publicly, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to get a deciſion in his favour from the <hi>Salamanca divines.</hi> C'eſt ce qui engagea <hi>Charles</hi> V. de faire faire une conſultation aux theologiens de <hi>Salamanque,</hi> pour ſavoir ſi en conſcience on pouvoit diſſequer un corps humain, pour en connoître la ſtructure. (<hi>Niceron</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs:) They would not let him ſettle in <hi>France;</hi> but the republic of <hi>Venice</hi> gave him a profeſſor's chair at <hi>Padua,</hi> where he diſſected publicly, and taught anatomy ſeven years. He was but 18, when he publiſhed his famous book, <hi>La fabrique du corps humain,</hi> which was
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:0028500202:464"/>the admiration of all men of ſcience: And a little after, he made a preſent of the firſt <hi>ſkeleton</hi> the world ever ſaw, to the univerſity of <hi>Bale;</hi> where it is ſtill to be ſeen. This great man, <hi>Andrew Veſal,</hi> was born the laſt of April, 1512; and in the 58th year of his age, October 15, 1564, he was ſhipwreck'd on the iſle of <hi>Zante,</hi> and in the deſerts there was famiſhed to death. His body was found by a goldſmith of his acquaintance, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to land there not long after, and by this man bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. <hi>Veſal</hi>'s works are two volumes in folio, publiſhed by <hi>Herman Boerhaave, Lugduni Batavorum,</hi> 1725.

The names of the antient original greek medical writers are, <hi>Hippocrates, Dioſcorides, Aritaeus, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> The latin writers of phyſic are, <hi>Celſus, Scribonius Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Caelius Aurelianus, Marcellus Empericus, Theodorus Priſcianus,</hi> and <hi>Sextus Placitus.</hi> We have beſides ſeveral <hi>collectors,</hi> as <hi>Oriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Aetius, Paulus Aeginita,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nicander,</hi> the medical poet; and the <hi>fragments</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus, Rufus Epheſius, Zonorates, Vindicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Diocles Caryſtius, Caſſius,</hi> and a few others: but all theſe may be looked into af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. The original authors are ſufficient in the noviciate.</p>
                  <p>As to the latin medical writers, <hi>Celſus,</hi> and <hi>Caelius Aurelianus</hi> only, are worth read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Celſus</hi> lived in the latter end of the reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and is admirable for the purity of his latin, and the elegance of his ſenſe. You muſt have him night and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your hands, till you are a maſter of the terms and expreſſions peculiar to phyſic, which occur in him. The ſtyle of <hi>Caelius</hi> is very bad, and his cavils tedious: but his deſcription of diſeaſes is full and accurate. In this reſpect he is a very valuable writer. He lived in the ſecond century, as did <hi>Galen</hi> likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who was contemporary with <hi>Socrates,</hi> he was born the firſt year of the Soth Olympiad, 460 before Chriſt. <hi>René
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:0028500202:466"/>Chartier</hi>'s Edit. <hi>Paris,</hi> 1639, is the moſt pompous: but <hi>Vander Linden</hi>'s, <hi>Leyden,</hi> 1668, 2 vols. in 8vo, is the beſt. When I read <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> I did alſo look into <hi>Proſper Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pini</hi>'s good book, <hi>De preſagienda vita, et morte aegrotantium:</hi> In which he has with great care collected and methodized all the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered obſervations of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> relating to the dangerous or ſalutary appearances in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. At the ſame time, I likewiſe read this great man's <hi>Medicina Methodica.</hi> (He died profeſſor of botany at <hi>Padua,</hi> Feb. 1617, Aet 64. and was born November, 1553.) I did likewiſe look into the beſt commentators on <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> whoſe names you will find in <hi>Conringius</hi>'s Introduction, which I have mentioned.</p>

The beſt edition of <hi>Galen</hi>'s works, are that of <hi>Bâle,</hi> 1538, in 5 vols. and that of <hi>Venice,</hi> 1625, in 7 volumes. <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Tralles</hi> flouriſhed in the 6th century, under <hi>Juſtinian the Great,</hi> and left the following works, <hi>Therapentica, Lib</hi> 12. <hi>De ſingularum corporis partium vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis, aegritudinibus, &amp; injuriis, Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Epiſt. de lumbricis: Tractatus de puerorum morbis: Liber de febribus.</hi> The beſt <hi>greek</hi> copy is
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:0028500202:467"/>that of <hi>Stephens, Paris,</hi> 1548, folio. In <hi>greek</hi> and <hi>latin, Baſil,</hi> 1658. But in neither of theſe editions is to be found the Epiſtle <hi>de lumbricis.</hi> You muſt look for that in the 12th volume of <hi>Fabricius</hi>'s <hi>Bibliotheca Graeca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, beſides all the authors I have mentioned, I likewiſe looked into the original <hi>obſervation writers,</hi> and <hi>miſcellane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous books</hi> relating to <hi>phyſic.</hi> They afford ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge, where the authors are faithful and judicious. Such are the <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationes medicae</hi> of <hi>Nicolaus Tulpius</hi> (a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous book; and the dedication of it to his ſon <hi>Peter,</hi> a ſtudent in phyſic, good advice; 2d edition, 1652, is the beſt: it is a fourth part larger than the 1ſt edition, that came out in 1641.) The <hi>obſervationes et curationes medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinales</hi> of <hi>Petrus Foreſtus, Lib.</hi> 22. — The <hi>obſervationes medicae</hi> of <hi>Joannes Theodorus Schenkius.</hi> — And the various Journals, and Tranſactions of learned Societies; which are repoſitories in which the physician finds much rare and valuable knowledge.

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:0028500202:469"/>a picture tablet that engaged our attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it was a thing intirely new, both with regard to the painting and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. For ſome time, we ſtood conſidering the device and fable, but ſtill found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unable to gueſs the meaning. The piece did not ſeem to be either a city or a camp; but was a kind of a walled court, that had within it two other incloſures, and one of them was lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the other. The firſt court opened at a gate, before which a vaſt crowd of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple appeared, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to enter; and within a group of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male figures was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. Stationed at the porch without, was ſeen a venerable
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:0028500202:470"/>form, who looked like ſome great teacher, and ſeemed to warn the ruſhing multitude. Long we gazed at this work, but were not able to underſtand the deſign, till an old man came up to us, and ſpoke in the following manner.</p>

The piece is not an offering of any of our citizens, but the work of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, a man of great learning and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and a zealous diſciple of the <hi>Samian</hi> or <hi>Elean</hi> ſages, who
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:0028500202:471"/>arrived here many years ago, and by his converſation inſtructied us in the <hi>beſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which is <hi>morality.</hi> It was he built and conſecrated this <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and placed here this pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you ſee before you.</p>

                     <p> Conducted by the <hi>Virtues,</hi> he goes back to ſurvey his firſt abode, and ſee the crowd he left;—how miſerably they paſs their time; waſte all their hours in crimes, and in the whirl of paſſions live. <hi>Slaves</hi> to <hi>ambition, pride, incontinence, vanity,</hi> and <hi>avarice,</hi> they appear tormented with endleſs anxiety. They have forgot the inſtructions the good <hi>genius</hi> gave them, at their entrance into life, and ſuffer thus becauſe they cannot find the way to <hi>Wiſdom.</hi>

                     <p> True: (I ſaid) But I cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, why the <hi>Virtues</hi> ſhould bring the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes back to the place they came from: Why ſhould they return to view a well-known ſcene?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>O.</speaker>
                     <p> The reaſon (anſwered my inſtructor) is, becauſe they had not a true idea of what they had ſeen. Surrounded by a confuſion
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:0028500202:485"/>of things as they paſſed on, they could not diſtinctly perceive what was done. The miſts of ignorance and error obſcured the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as they journied on, and by that means, they were ſubject to miſtakes. They could not always diſtinguiſh between <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi> But now that they have attained to <hi>true learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> with concern they behold the <hi>mad world</hi> the <hi>virtues</hi> ſhew them again, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by wiſdom, are perfectly happy in themſelves. The miſery of the numberleſs fools they behold now, ſtrikes them very ſtrongly, and gives them a delightful reliſh for their preſent happineſs.</p>

                     <p> It muſt be ſo. And when they have ſeen theſe things, where do they then go?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>O.</speaker>
                     <p> Wherever they pleaſe. Safely they may travel where they will: In all times, and in all places they are ſecure, as their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity</hi> is their <hi>defence.</hi> Every where they live eſteemed and beloved by all. The <hi>female monſters</hi> I have mentioned, <hi>Grief, Trouble, Luſt, Avarice,</hi> or <hi>Poverty,</hi> have now no power to hurt them; but as if poſſeſſed of ſome vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous drug, they can graſp the viper, and defy deſtruction.</p>

                     <p> Thoſe that are crowned (the old man ſaid) are the happy few I have deſcribed. You ſee what joy is in their faces: And thoſe

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>O.</speaker>
                     <p> They are the <hi>opinions,</hi> who having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the virtuous to the region of light, are coming back to invite and carry others thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by ſhewing them the felicity and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of thoſe they brought to the manſion of Wiſdom.</p>

                     <p> No: <hi>Opinion</hi> can never reach to <hi>ſcience;</hi> they only deliver their charge into the hands
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0028500202:487"/>of wiſdom, and then, like ſhips that give up their lading, in order to ſail for a new cargo, they return to bring other <hi>Eleves</hi> to reaſon and felicity.</p>

                     <p> This <hi>explanation</hi> of the <hi>table,</hi> (I ſaid) is quite ſatisfactory: But you have not yet informed us, what the <hi>good genius</hi> bids the multitude do, as they appear on the verge of life?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p> He charges them to act with courage, and be magnanimous and brave in all events; a thing I recommend to you, young man; and that you may have a true idea of this, I will tell you what I mean by a <hi>bold ſpirit,</hi> in paſſing through this world.</p>

                     <p> Then lifting up his arm again, and pointing with his wand to a <hi>figure</hi> in the <hi>picture;</hi> that <hi>blind woman</hi> ſtanding on a <hi>globe,</hi> as I told you before, is <hi>Fortune.</hi> The <hi>genius</hi> forbids us to truſt her, or imagine her ſmiles will be laſting happineſs. Reaſon is never concerned in what the does. It is Fortune ſtill; without principle ſhe acts, is arbitrary and capricious, and inconſiderately and raſhly for ever proceeds. Regard not then her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, nor mind her frowns: But as ſhe gives and takes away, and often deprives of what we had before, we are neither to eſteem or deſpiſe her; but if we ſhould receive from her a gift, take care to employ it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to ſome good purpoſe, and eſpecially
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:0028500202:488"/>in the acquiſition of true ſcience, the moſt laſting and precious poſſeſſion. If we act otherwiſe, in reſpect of Fortune, we imitate thoſe wretched uſurers, who rejoice at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney paid in to them, as if they received it for their own uſe; but pay it back with regret, forgetting the condition, that it was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the proprietor on demand. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of Fortune then, and all her changes in this mortal life, the <hi>genius</hi> adviſes to paſs bravely on, without hearkning to the ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Incontinence</hi> and <hi>Luxury</hi> in the firſt incloſure, to reject their <hi>temptations,</hi> and go on to <hi>falſe learning:</hi> With her he would have us make a ſhort ſtay, to learn what may be of ſervice to uſe in our journey to Wiſdom. This is the advice of the <hi>genius</hi> to thoſe who enter into life.</p>

                     <p> Here the good <hi>old man</hi> had done, and I thanked him for his explanation of the <hi>picture.</hi> Only one thing (I ſaid) there was more, which I muſt requeſt he would tell me the meaning of. What is it we can get by our ſtay with <hi>falſe learning?</hi>

                     <p> Things (he anſwered) that may be of uſe to us. The <hi>languages,</hi> and other parts of education, which <hi>Plato</hi> recommends, may hinder us from being worſe employ'd, and keep us from illicit gratification. They are not abſolutely neceſſary to true happineſs; but they contribute to make us better. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:0028500202:489"/>thing good and uſeful they do afford; tho' virtue, which ought to be the principal buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in view, may be acquired without them. We may become wiſe without the aſſiſtance of the arts, tho' (as obſerved before,) they are far from being uſeleſs: as by a good tranſlation made into our own tongue, we may know what an author means, and yet by taking the pains to become maſters of the original language, might gain more advantages,—ſuch as entring better into the writer's ſenſe, and diſcovering ſome beauties which cannot otherwiſe be found: So the uſeful things in the ſciences may be very quickly and eaſily learned, and tho' by great labour in becoming accurately acquainted with them, we might fill our heads with ſpeculations, yet this cannot make us the wiſer and better men. <hi>Without being learned,</hi> we may be <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good.</hi>

                     <p> And are the <hi>learned</hi> then in no better a condition than the <hi>people</hi> in reſpect of <hi>moral excellence?</hi> (I ſaid).

                        <hi>Blind</hi> as the <hi>crowd</hi> is the <hi>man of letters,</hi> in this particular (my inſtructor replied): All his <hi>ſtudies</hi> and <hi>curious knowledge</hi> have no <hi>relation</hi> to his <hi>living right.</hi> With all the <hi>tongues,</hi> and all the <hi>arts,</hi> he may be a <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>

                     <p> It is their remaining in this <hi>ſecond inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> that occaſions their being inferior in moral things to thoſe who have not had a learned education. <hi>Proud</hi> and ſelf-ſufficient on account of their <hi>languages, arts,</hi> and <hi>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> they deſpiſe what Wiſdom could teach them, and will not give themſelves the trouble of aſcending with difficulty to the manſion of <hi>true learning.</hi> They have no taſte for the <hi>leſſons</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> while the <hi>humble</hi> mount to her exalted dwelling, thoſe <hi>ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> as you ſee, are ſatisfied with their <hi>ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> and <hi>vain conceits.

                        <pb n="476" facs="tcp:0028500202:491"/>are what they only have a reliſh for; the <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> of thoſe <hi>men of letters</hi> cannot reach that ineffable peace and contentment, that ſatisfaction and pleaſure, which flow from a <hi>virtuous life</hi> and an <hi>honeſt heart.</hi> This is the caſe of our <hi>learned heads,</hi> uleſs <hi>repentance</hi> interferes to make them <hi>humble,</hi> and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the <hi>vain viſions</hi> they had from <hi>falſe opinion.</hi>

                           <p>And, as perſons now wholly devoted to the Lord of heaven and earth, be not conformed to the faſhions and ways of this world; but be ye transformed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of your mind; that ye may prove what is the good, the acceptable, and perfect will of God. Abhor that which is evil, in all your dealings: Cleave to that which is good: Let love be without diſſimulation, and be kindly affectioned one to another; not advancing yourſelves, but in honour preferring one another. Be not ſlothful in buſineſs, but fervent in ſpirit; as ſerving the Lord Jehovah in your ſeveral ſtations. Rejoice in hope of a refreſhment to come, in the realms of bliſs: Be patient in tribulation, which God will reward, and continue inſtant in prayer.</p>
                           <p>In ſum, let us follow the ſteps of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his <hi>divine humility,</hi> his <hi>devotion,</hi> his <hi>love,</hi> be for ever <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>forbearing, gentle</hi> and <hi>charitable,</hi> and <hi>live in the ſpirit of prayer.</hi>"</p>

Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s tranſlation is by far the fineſt, to be ſure. It is a charming thing: but whether it comes ſo near the intended <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>briſk turns</hi> of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> as a <hi>third tranſlation</hi> the Reader will find at the end of this ſection, may admit of ſome conſideration. — I add here the ſixteen laſt lines of <hi>Dryden's Verſion,</hi> the moſt beautiful part of the Satire; that it may be near for comparing with the tranſlation I have mentioned.— And for the ſame reaſon, I likewiſe place here the ſame number of lines done by <hi>Stapylton.</hi>

                  </note>§. 1. HAVING married the illuſtrious <hi>Julia,</hi> as related in my laſt Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by the death of her father ſoon after the wedding, acquired a handſome ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:0028500202:495"/>a conſiderable ſum of money, and a valuable collection of books; I thought myſelf ſo happily ſituated in the midſt of
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:0028500202:496"/>flouriſhing mercies, and ſo well ſecured from adverſity, that it was hardly poſſible for the flame of deſtruction to reach me. But when I had not the leaſt reaſon to imagine cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity was near me, and fondly imagined pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity was my own, infelicity came ſtalking on unſeen; and from a fulneſs of peace, plunged us at once into an abyſs of woe. It was our wont, when the evenings were fine, to take boat at the bottom of a meadow, at the end of our garden, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:0028500202:497"/>of a deep river, paſs an hour or two in fiſhing; but at laſt, by ſome accident or other, a ſlip of the foot, or the boat's being got a little too far from the bank-ſide, <hi>Julia</hi> fell in and was drowned. This happened in the tenth month of our marriage. The loſs of this <hi>charming angel</hi> in ſuch a manner, ſat powerfully on my ſpirits for ſome time; and the remembrance of her perfections, and the delights I enjoyed while ſhe lived, made me wiſh I had never ſeen her. To be ſo vaſtly happy as I was, and be deprived of her in a moment, in ſo ſhocking a way, was an affliction I was hardly able to bear. It ſtruck me to the heart. I ſat with my eyes ſhut ten days.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A reflexion on the death of <hi>Julia.</hi>
                  </note>§. 2. But loſſes and pains I conſidered were the portion of mortals in this trying ſtate, and from thence we ought to learn to give up our <hi>own wills;</hi> and to get rid of all <hi>eager wiſhes,</hi> and <hi>violent affection,</hi> that we may take up our <hi>reſt</hi> wholly in that which <hi>pleaſeth</hi> God: Carrying our ſubmiſſion to him ſo far, as to bleſs his <hi>correcting</hi> hand, and <hi>kiſs</hi> that <hi>rod</hi> that cures our paſſionate eagerneſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, and folly.</p>
               <p>We ought likewiſe to learn from ſuch things, to look upon the ſad accidents of life, as not worthy to be compared with what <hi>Chriſt</hi> underwent for our ſakes, who, <hi>though
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:0028500202:498"/>he was a Son, yet he learnt obedience by the things that he ſuffered;</hi> and with chriſtian reſignation live in a quiet expectance of a future happy ſtate, after our patience has had its perfect work: Conſidering that theſe light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary afflictions, are not worthy to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> with the <hi>glory</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed for us; and if we are <hi>faithful to death,</hi> hath promiſed to beſtow upon us.</p>
               <p>In all theſe things reſigning to the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God, and not merely to his will and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, believing his diſpoſal to be wiſeſt and beſt; and that his declarations and promiſes are true, though we cannot in ſome caſes diſcern the reaſon of ſuch an <hi>end,</hi> and ſuch <hi>means</hi> being connected: Nor can imagine how ſome <hi>promiſes</hi> can be made good. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> (I ſaid) my ſoul! <hi>Patience,</hi> and what thou knoweſt not now, thou ſhalt know in a <hi>little time.</hi> Thus I reaſoned, as I ſat with my eyes ſhut.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Thoughts on wives and whores.</note>§. 3. And when I had done, I called to <hi>Soto ô Finn,</hi> my man, to bring the horſes out immediately, and I would go ſome where or other to ſee new ſcenes, and if I could, get <hi>another wife:</hi> As I was born with the diſeaſe of repletion, and had made a reſolution not to fornicate; it was incumbent on me to have a ſiſter and companion, with whom I might lawfully carry on the ſucceſſion. As a friend
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:0028500202:499"/>to ſociety, and paſſively-obedient to the laws of my higher country, a wife for ever, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; for, if on loſing one, we can be ſtill ſo fortunate as to get another, who is pretty without pride; witty without affectation; to virtue only and her friends a friend:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Whoſe ſenſe is great, and great her ſkill,</l>
                  <l>For reaſon always guides her will;</l>
                  <l>Civil to all, to all ſhe's juſt,</l>
                  <l>And faithful to her friend and truſt:</l>
                  <l>Whoſe character, in ſhort, is ſuch,</l>
                  <l>That none can love or praiſe too much.</l>
               </q>
               <p>If ſuch a charmer ſhould again appear, and ten thouſand ſuch there ever are among the ſex, ſilly and baſe tho' the majority may be; what man could ſay he had had enough of <hi>wedlock,</hi> becauſe he had buried ſeven ſuch wives? I am ſure I could not. And if, like the men who were but ſtriplings at four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, in the beginning of this world, I was to live for ages, and by accidents loſt ſuch partners as I have deſcribed; I would with rapture take hundreds of them to my breaſt, one after another, and piouſly propagate the kind. The moſt deſpicable of all creatures is a <hi>whore.</hi> An <hi>abomination</hi> to <hi>heaven:</hi> And if <hi>God</hi> was a mere fanciful fear; yet ſuch a wretch the <hi>proſtitute</hi> is, that neither <hi>honour</hi> nor <hi>honeſty</hi> can ever be expected from her. But, in <hi>defiance</hi> to <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>human laws,</hi> ſhe lives a <hi>fee</hi> to <hi>mankind;</hi> to <hi>ruin</hi> the <hi>fortune,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:0028500202:500"/>pox</hi> the <hi>body,</hi> and for ever <hi>damn</hi> the <hi>ſoul</hi> of the miſerable man, who is dunce enough to become a <hi>Limberham</hi> to the <hi>execrable wretch.</hi> The misfortunes I have known happen to gentlemen of my acquaintance, by <hi>ſtreet-whores, chamber-whores,</hi> and <hi>kept-whores,</hi> would make a volume as large as this I am writing: and leave another world quite out of the hiſtory. I have ſeen gentlemen of the beſt fortunes and education, become <hi>worn-out beggars</hi> in the ſtreets of <hi>London,</hi> without any thing hardly to cover them, by the means of thoſe execrable harlots; ſome have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>bullies</hi> to bawdy-houſes; and many I have beheld going to the gallows, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the falſeſt and leaſt-engaging of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: But take a modeſt ſenſible woman to your heart, who has the fear of the great God before her eyes, and a regard to the laws of her country: Share your fortune gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with her, that ſhe may have her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent amuſements and dreſs, be for ever good-humoured, be true to her bed, and every felicity you may taſte that it is poſſible to enjoy in this lower hemiſphere. Let a <hi>wife</hi> be our choice, as we are <hi>rationals.</hi>

               <p>From the date of this letter it appeared, that they were not a month gone before my arrival; but to what place they ſaid not, and it was in vain for me to enquire. I found every thing in good order, and all the goods ſafe;
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:0028500202:502"/>the garden full of fruits and vegetables, and plenty of various eatables in the houſe, pickled, potted, and preſerved. As it was in the month of <hi>June,</hi> the ſolitude looked vaſtly charming in it's vales and foreſt, its rocks and waters; and for a month I ſtrove to amuſe myſelf there, in fiſhing, ſhooting, and improving the ground; but it was ſo dull, ſo ſad a ſcene, when I miſſed the bright companions I had with me in former days; who uſed to wander with me in the vallies, up the hills, by the ſtreams, and make the whole a paradiſe all the long day, that I could not bear it longer than four weeks; and rid from thence to Dr. <hi>Stanvil</hi>'s ſeat, to aſk him how he did, and look once more at that fine curioſity, Miſs <hi>Dunk</hi> that was, but at the time I am ſpeaking of, his wife. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, before I left my lodge, I made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery one day, as I was exploring the wild country, round my little houſe, that was entertaining enough, and to this day, in remembrance, ſeems to me ſo agreeable, that I imagine a relation of this matter may be grateful to my Readers.

                  <head>The Hiſtory of the beautiful LEONORA.</head>
                  <p>§. 5. As I rambled one ſummer's morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with my gun and my dog; over the vaſt mountains, which ſurrounded me at <hi>Orton-lodge,</hi> I came as the ſun was riſing to a valley about four miles from my houſe, which I had not ſeen before, as the way to it, over the <hi>Fells,</hi> was a dangerous road. It was green and flowery, had clumps of oaks in ſeveral ſpots, and from the hovering top of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice at the end of the glin, a river falls ingulphed in rifted rocks. It is a fine rural ſcene.</p>
                  <p>Here I ſat down to reſt myſelf, and was admiring the natural beauties of the place, when I ſaw three <hi>females</hi> turn into the vale, and walk towards the <hi>water-fall.</hi> One of them, who appeared to be the miſtreſs, had an extravagance of beauty in her face, and a form ſuch as I had not often ſeen. The others were pretty women, dreſt like quakers, and very clean. They came very near the water where I was, but did not ſee me, as I was behind two rocks which almoſt joined: And after they had looked a while at the headlong river, they went back, and entring a narrow-way between two hills diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. I was greatly ſurpriſed at what I
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:0028500202:504"/>had ſeen, not imagining I had ſuch a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> and reſolved to know who this beauty was. The wonders of her face, her figure, and her mien, were ſtriking to the laſt degree.</p>
                  <p>Ariſing then as ſoon as they were out of ſight, I walked on to the turning I ſaw them enter; and in half an hour's time came to a plain, thro' which ſeveral brooks wandered, and on the margin of one of them, was a grove and a manſion. It was a ſweet habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, at the entrance of the little wood; and before the door, on banks of flowers, ſat the illuſtrious owner of this retreat, and her two maids. In ſuch a place, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo unexpectedly to find ſo charming a woman, ſeemed to me as pleaſing an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as could be met with in travelling over the world.</p>
                  <p>At my coming near this lady ſhe appeared to be aſtoniſhed, and to wonder much at ſeeing ſuch an inhabitant in that part of the world: but on pulling off my hat, and telling her I came to viſit her as her neighbour; to pay my humble reſpects to her, and beg the honour of her acquaintance; ſhe aſked me, from what vale or mountain I came, and how long I had been a reſident in that wild part of the world ? This produced a compend of ſome part of my ſtory, and when I had done, ſhe deſired, me to walk in. Coffee
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:0028500202:505"/>and hot rolls was ſoon brought, and we break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted chearfully together. I took my leave ſoon after, having made her a preſent of ſome black cocks and a hare I had ſhot that morning; and hoped, if it was poſſible to find an eaſy way to my lodge, which I did not yet know, that I ſhould ſome time or other be honoured with her preſence at my little houſe; which was worth her ſeeing, as it was ſituated in the moſt delightful part of this romantic ſilent place, and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny curioſities near it; that in the mean time, if it was agreeable, I would wait upon her again, before I left <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> which would be ſoon: For I only came to ſee how things were, and was obliged to haſten another way. This <hi>beauty</hi> replied, that it would give her pleaſure to ſee me, when I had a few hours to ſpare. Three times more then I went very ſoon; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came well acquainted, and after dinner one day, ſhe gave me the following relation.</p>
                  <p>My name was <hi>Leonora Sarsfield</hi> before I married an Iriſhman, one <hi>Burk,</hi> whom I met at <hi>Avignon</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> He is one of the handſomeſt men of the age, tho' his hopes were all his fortune; but proved a villain as great as ever diſgraced mankind. His breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and his eloquence, added to his fine figure, induced me to fancy him an angel of a man, and imagine I had well beſtowed a hundred
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:0028500202:506"/>thouſand pounds, to make him great, and as happy as the day is long: For three months he played the <hi>god,</hi> and I fondly thought there was not ſuch another happy woman as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all the world. I was miſtaken. <hi>Burk</hi> found out by ſome means or other, that I had concealed five thouſand pounds of my fortune from his knowledge; and that I was in my heart ſo good a <hi>proteſtant,</hi> that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring me over to <hi>popery,</hi> or ever get me to be an <hi>idolater</hi> at the <hi>maſs,</hi> before the <hi>tiny god of dough:</hi>—that I could never be brought to look upon the <hi>invented ſuperſtitions,</hi> and <hi>horrible corruptions</hi> of the <hi>church of Rome,</hi> as the true religion; nor be ever perſuaded to aſſiſt at the <hi>Latin ſervice</hi> in that communion, as it muſt be an <hi>abomination</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and to <hi>God,</hi> if the <hi>goſpel</hi> may be depended upon as the <hi>rule of faith:</hi> —When <hi>Burk</hi> perceived theſe things, he threw off the diſguiſe, and appeared a <hi>monſter</hi> inſtead of a man, as he was a <hi>bigot</hi> of the firſt order, a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>papiſt,</hi> (which I did not know, when we married;) and as he was by nature as <hi>cruel,</hi> as he was <hi>avaricious</hi> by principle, he began to uſe me in the vileſt manner, and by <hi>words</hi> and <hi>deeds,</hi> did all he could to make my life a burthen to me. He was for ever abuſing me in the vileſt language; curſing me for a heretic for ever damned; and by blows compelling me to inform him where my money was. He has left me all
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:0028500202:507"/>over blood very often, and when he found I ſtill held out, and would not diſcover to him what remained of my fortune; nor, which I valued much more than my money, violate my religion, by renouncing the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and practice of the reformed church, and joining in the <hi>ſinful worſhip</hi> of the <hi>maſs;</hi> he came to me one night with a ſmall oak ſapling, and beat me in ſuch a manner as left me almoſt dead. He then went out of the houſe, told me he would return by twelve, and make me comply, or he would break every bone in my body. This happened at a country-ſeat of mine in this ſhire; all the ſervants being obliged to lie every night in an out-houſe, that he might have the more power over me. His <hi>exceſſive avarice</hi> was but one cauſe of this inhuman behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: It was the <hi>zeal</hi> of this <hi>raging bigot</hi> for his <hi>ever-curſed popery,</hi> that made him act the unrelenting inquiſitor.</p>

But as to my tragical relation, (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Leonora:</hi>) — Being thus left by <hi>Burk</hi> in this ſad ſituation, bleeding, and miſerable
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:0028500202:510"/>with pains, but ſtill in dread of worſe uſage on his return; I crawled down ſtairs, to a ſmall door in a back place, which opened to a private way out of the houſe. This was known only to myſelf, as it was a paſſage my father had made, (in caſe of thieves, or any villains,) from a little unfrequented cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, by a narrow aſcending arch, to a thicket in the corner of a ſhrubby field, at a ſmall diſtance from the houſe. To a labyrinth made in this ſmall grove I made what haſte I could, and had not been long there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I perceived through the trees my inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man huſband; and as he came near me, heard him ſay, ſhe ſhall tell me where my money is, (for all ſhe has is mine;) and worſhip our <hi>lady</hi> and the <hi>hoſt,</hi> or I will burn

The ſight of the monſter made me tremble to ſo violent a degree, that I was ſcarcely able to proceed to the cottage of a poor woman, my ſure friend, about two miles from the place I was hid in; but I did my beſt to creep through croſs ways, and after many difficulties, and ſuffering much by going over ditches, I got to my reſting-place. The old woman, my nurſe, ſcreeched at the ſight of me, as I was ſadly torn, and all over gore. Such a ſpectacle to be ſure has ſeldom been ſeen. But by peace and proper things, I got well again in two months, and removed to this lone houſe, which my father had built in this ſpot for his occaſional retirement. Here I have been for two years paſt, and am as happy as I deſire to be: Nay vaſtly ſo, as I am now free and delivered from a monſter, whoſe avarice and cruelty made me a ſpectacle to angels and men: Becauſe, Sir, I would not reduce myſelf to the ſtate of a beggar, to ſatisfy his inſatiable love of money: nor worſhip his <hi>dead-woman,</hi> and <hi>bit of bread;</hi> his <hi>rabble</hi> of, <hi>ſaints, images, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> and that <hi>ſovereign cheat,</hi> the <hi>Pope;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not give up all I had, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <hi>idolater,</hi> as far more <hi>deſpicable</hi> and <hi>ſinful</hi> than the <hi>antient Pagans;</hi> as the <hi>Romiſh ritual</hi> and <hi>devotions,</hi> are more <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable</hi>

                  <p>Such, Sir, was my <hi>fatal marriage,</hi> which I thought would be a ſtock of ſuch felicities, that time only by many years could reduce to an evaneſcent ſtate, and deprive me of: As <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was at the <hi>bridal</hi> with her whole retinue; the <hi>ardent amorous boy,</hi> the <hi>ſiſter-graces</hi> in their looſe attire; <hi>Aglavia, Thalia,</hi> and <hi>Euphroſine,</hi> bright, blooming, and gay; and was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Youth,</hi> that <hi>wayward thing</hi> without her; was conducted by <hi>Mercury,</hi> the <hi>god</hi> of <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> and by <hi>Pitho,</hi> the <hi>goddeſs</hi> of <hi>perſuaſion;</hi> as all ſeemed pleaſurable and inchanting, my young imagination formed golden ſcenes, and painted a happineſs quite glorious and ſecure. But how precarious and periſhing is what we mortals call felicity! <hi>Love</hi> and his <hi>mother</hi> diſappeared very ſoon, as I have related; and to them ſucceeded <hi>impetuous paſſion,</hi> intenſe, raging, terrible, with all the <hi>furies</hi> in the train. The <hi>maſked hero</hi> I had married was a <hi>Phalaris,</hi> a <hi>miſer,</hi> a <hi>papiſt;</hi> a wretch who had no taſte for love, no conception of virtue, no ſenſe of charms; but to <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>popery</hi> would ſacrifice every thing that is <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>laudable.</hi> Le <hi>Diable a quatre</hi> he ſhined in as a player, and was the <hi>Devil himſelf</hi> in <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood.</hi>

                           <p>And ſo excellent a thing, Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> biſhop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury</hi> thought this <hi>Satire,</hi> that in his famous <hi>Paſtoral Letter</hi> he recommmends it, (and the <hi>Satires</hi> of <hi>Perſius</hi>), to the peruſal and practice of the divines in his dioceſe, as the beſt <hi>common places</hi> for their ſermons; and what may be taught with more profit to the audience, than all the new ſpeculations of divinity, and controverſies concerning faith; which are more for the profit of the ſhepherd, than for the edification of the flock. In the Satires, nothing is propoſed but the quiet and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the mind. Virtue is lodged at home, (as Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> expreſſes it, in his fine dedication to the Earl of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi>), and diffuſed to the improvement and good of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind. <hi>Paſſion, intereſt, ambition, myſtery, fury,</hi> and every cruel conſequence, are baniſhed from the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of theſe <hi>ſtoics,</hi> and only the <hi>moral virtues</hi> incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, for the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>mankind.</hi>

FROM <hi>Orton-lodge</hi> I went to <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſora,</hi> to pay my reſpects to Dr. <hi>Stanvil</hi> and his charming conſort. I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them both with the greateſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and civility; but as before, this lady did not ſeem to have had any former acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, one might well think from the part ſhe acted, that ſhe had never ſeen me, till the accident I have related brought me to her huſband's houſe. I did not however even hint any thing to the contrary, but turning to the Doctor a little after my arrival, began to aſk him ſome queſtions.</p>
               <p>

As he had an Eſſay on fevers in his hand, when I entred the room, I requeſted to know, how he accounted for the effects of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> in raiſing and ſtrengthning a low trembling pulſe, and driving the natural heat and efflatus of the blood outward,—in giving relief in delirious ravings, ſtupors, and loſs of reaſon,—in reducing continual fevers to diſtinct remiſſions,—and in cleanſing and opening the obſtructed glands and lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, ſo as to bring on the critical ſweats, let looſe the ſaliva and glandular ſecretions, and bring down the thick ſoluble urine? How does <hi>bliſtering,</hi> ſo happily brought in by the phyſical bully of this age, Dr. <hi>Radcliff,</hi> ſo wonderfully cool and dilute the blood? It ſeems to me ſomewhat ſtrange.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how the cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides act on the body in bliſters.</note>§. 3. Dr. <hi>Stanvil</hi> replied: It is eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. The <hi>Spaniſh fly,</hi> that extremely hot and perfectly cauſtic inſect, is ſtocked with a ſubtile, active, and extremely pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſalt, which enters the blood upon the application of the bliſter, and paſſes with it through the ſeveral glandular ſtrainers and ſecretory ducts. This ſtimulating force of the fly's ſalt, occaſions the pain felt in making the water with a bliſter, (which may be taken off by a thin emulſion made with the pulp of roaſted apples in milk and water), and cauſes
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:0028500202:530"/>the liberal, foul and ſtinking ſweats, while the <hi>Epiſpaſtic</hi> is on.</p>
               <p>This being evident, it is plain from thence, that the penetrating ſalts of the <hi>fly,</hi> that is, the volatile pungent parts of the <hi>cantharides,</hi> act in the blood by diſſolving, attenuating, and ratifying the viſcid coheſions of the lymph and ſerum; by ſtimulating the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous coats of the veſſels, throw off their ſtagnating viſcidities, and by cleanſing the glands, and forcing out the coagulated ſerum, reſtore the circulation and freedom of lymph from the arteries to the veins; opening, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cleanſing at the ſame time, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatory glands.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs of God in the production of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh fly, for the benefit of man.</note>In ſhort, as common cathartics purge the guts and cleanſe and throw off their clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſtagnating, and obſtructing contents, by rarifying and diſſolving the viſcid coheſions of the fluids, and by ſtimulating the ſolids; ſo do the active ſalts of the <hi>fly</hi> penetrate the whole animal machine, become a glandular lymphatic purge, and perform the ſame thing in all the ſmall ſtraining conveying pipes, that common purgatives effect in the inteſtines: and as by this means, all the ſluices and outlets of the glandular ſecretions are opened, the cantharides muſt be cooling, diluting, and refrigerating in their effects to the greateſt degree, tho' ſo very hot, cauſtic, and pungent in themſelves. So wonderfully

It is not by a <hi>diſcharge</hi> of <hi>ſerum,</hi> as too many doctors imagine, that a <hi>bliſter</hi> relieves, for five times the quantity may be brought off by bleeding, vomiting, or purging; but the benefit is intirely owing to that <hi>heating, atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating,</hi> and <hi>pungent ſalt</hi> of this <hi>fly,</hi> (and this fly only), which the <hi>divine power</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> has made a <hi>lymphatic purgative,</hi> or <hi>glandular cathartic</hi> for the relief of man, in this fatal and tormenting malady.

Here the <hi>Doctor</hi> dropt off his chair, juſt as he had pronounced the word men, and in a moment became a lifeleſs ſordid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. His death was occaſioned by the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of his ſtomach, as I found upon opening his body, at the requeſt of his lady.—When the blood which is confined within the veſſels of the human body, is agitated with a due motion, it maintains life; but if there be a ſtagnation of it in an artery, it makes an <hi>aneuriſm;</hi> in a vein, a <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rix;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>An animal (obſerve me Reader) muſt live ſo long as this fluid circulates through the conical pipes in his body, from the leſſer baſe in the centre, the heart, to the greater in the extreme parts; and from the capillary evaneſcent arteries, by the naſcent returning veins to the heart again; but when this fluid ceaſes to flow through the incurved canals, and the velocities are no longer in the inverſe duplicate ratio of the inflated pipes, then it dies. The animal has done for ever with <hi>food</hi> and <hi>ſex;</hi> the two great principles which move this world, and produce not only ſo much honeſt induſtry, but ſo many wars and fightings, ſuch cruel oppreſſions, and that variety of woes we read of in the tragical hiſtory of the world.

Or, as the learned <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Peter-houſe,</hi> Dr. <hi>Edmund Law,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> informs us, it remains <hi>inſenſible</hi> for ages, till the <hi>conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of all things; — from the diſſolution of the body, is <hi>ſtupid, ſenſeleſs,</hi> and <hi>dead aſleep</hi> till the <hi>reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the caſe of my friend, Dr. <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> he dropt down dead at once. A rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in his ſtomach, by the heat and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of what he had taken the night before at ſupper, deſtroyed him. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave viſcus, or bowel, which is ſeated in the abdomen below the diaphragm, I mean the ſtomach, was inflamed, and as the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trunk of the <hi>aorta</hi> paſſes down between it and the ſpine, that is, between the ſtomach and back part of the ribs, the inflation and diſtention of the bowel compreſſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringed the tranſverſe ſection of the artery <hi>aorta,</hi> in its deſcending branch, and by leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:0028500202:534"/>it, impeded the deſcent of the blood from the heart, and obliged it to aſcend in a greater quantity than uſual to the head. By this means, the parts of the head were diſtended and ſtretched with blood, which brought on an apoplexy, and the operation upward being violent, the equilibrium was intirely broken, and the vital tide could flow no more. This I found on opening the body. I likewiſe obſerved that, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the compreſſure of the deſcending trunk of the artery <hi>aorta,</hi> the muſcular coats of the ſtomach were ſtretched, inflated, and diſtended; and of conſequence, the blood-veſſels which enter into the conſtitution of thoſe muſcles, were ſtretched, dilated, and turgid with blood, and therefore the blood could not be driven forward in the courſe of its circulation with its natural and due velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, but muſt prove an obſtacle to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the blood from the heart, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige almoſt the whole tide to move upwards. This, and the conſtringing the <hi>aorta,</hi> at its orifice or tranſverſe ſection, between the coſtae and the bowel called the ſtomach, is enough, I aſſure you, Reader, to knock up the head of a giant, and put a ſtop to all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature. Thus fell this gentleman in the 32d year of his age.</p>

He did not believe a tittle of our prieſtly myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or regard that religion which ſkulks behind the enormous columns of conſecrated opinions; but, as chriſtianity was revealed from heaven, to bring mankind to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the one ſupreme God and governour of the world, and lead them into the paths of humanity, he rejected the <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> of <hi>Monks</hi> and their diſciples, and in regard to the voice of <hi>reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> adored only the <hi>ſupreme Being,</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>keeping</hi> the <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and his <hi>love</hi> of his <hi>neighbour,</hi> by <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the good in his power.</hi> Such a man

To curb deſire, or ſuffer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely here, for the ſake of truth and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and then ceaſe to be, perhaps for ten thouſand years to come, or much longer; (for there is not any thing in revelation, or an appearance out of it, that can incline a rational man to think he is near the day of judgment or general reſurrection); this ſeems to be an obſtacle in the progreſs of the <hi>pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim:</hi> And therefore, why I rather think, we ſtep immediately from the <hi>dark experiences</hi> of this <hi>firſt ſtate,</hi> to a <hi>bliſsful conſciouſneſs</hi> in the regions of day, and by death are fixed in an eternal connexion with the wiſe, the virtuous, and the holy:—This, I ſay, I would in the next place proceed to treat of, by conſidering what the ſcriptures reveal in relation to death, and what is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

When the beautiful Mrs. <hi>Stanvil</hi> ſaw her huſband was really dead, and had paid that decent tribute of tears to his memory, which was due to a man, who left her in his will all his eſtates, real and perſonal, to be by her diſpoſed of as ſhe pleaſed; ſhe ſent for me to her chamber the next morning, and after a long converſation with her, told me, ſhe could now own who ſhe was, and inſtead of acting any longer by the directions of her head, let me know from her heart, that ſhe had ſtill the ſame regard for me, as when we travelled away together from her father's houſe in the Weſt, to the North of England: And if I would ſtay at <hi>Baſſora</hi> where I was, but for three months ſhe muſt be away, ſhe would then return, and her fortune and hand I might command. This I readily conſented to, and when the funeral was over ſhe departed. For the time agreed on, I continued in the houſe, and to a day ſhe was punctual in her return. We were married the week after, and I was even hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than I had ever been before; which muſt amount to a felicity inconceivably great indeed. Six months we reſided at her ſeat, and then thought it beſt to pay a viſit to my father in <hi>Ireland.</hi> We arrived at <hi>Bagatrogh Caſtle</hi> in the weſtern extremity of that iſland,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:0028500202:539"/>in the ſpring of the year 1735, and were moſt kindly received.</p>
               <p>My father longed to ſee me, and was very greatly rejoiced at my coming; but I found him in a dying way, paralytic all over, and ſcarcely able to ſpeak. To my amazement, he was become as ſtrict a <hi>unitarian</hi> as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and talked with abhorrence of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> religion. This was owing, he ſaid, to my <hi>MS. Remarks</hi> I left with him on <hi>Lord Nottingham's Anſwer to Mr. Whiſton's Letter to his Lordſhip;</hi> which <hi>MS.</hi> of mine he had often read over when I was gone, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was thoroughly convinced, on conſidering my reaſoning, that chriſtians are expreſly commanded, upon pain of God's diſpleaſure, to worſhip one ſupreme God, and him only, in the name and through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. Upon this religious practice as a fundamental rule he had at laſt fixed. He ſaw it was the ſafe way, and would never depart from it. He told me, the parſon of his pariſh, a right orthodox divine, who had been his chum in the univerſity, and very intimate with him, was greatly troubled at this change in his ſentiments, and ſaid many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere things; but he no more minded the <hi>Athanaſians</hi> now, than he did the <hi>idolatrous papiſts.</hi> This gave me great pleaſure, and recompenſed me for what I had ſuffered on a religious account.

               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>AND now, my candid Reader, to take my leave of you at this time, I have only to obſerve, that as this volume is full large, I cannot add my intended XVth ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only ſay in a ſhort ſummary, that ſoon after my arrival at <hi>Bagatrogh Caſtle,</hi> my father's ſeat on <hi>Mall-Bay,</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>Galway</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the old gentleman died, and as in a paſſion, he had irrevocably ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the greateſt part of his large eſtate on a near relation of mine, and had it not in his power to leave me more than a hundred a year, a little ready money, and a ſmall ſhip, which lay before his door in the Bay, he deſcended to the grave in great trouble, with many tears. Like old <hi>Iſaac</hi> over <hi>Eſau,</hi> he wept bitterly, and wiſhed in vain, that it was in his power to undo what he had done.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as my father was buried, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>England</hi> with my wife, in the little veſſel, now my own, which lay in the Bay,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:0028500202:541"/>and immediately after landing, and laying up my ſhip in a ſafe place, we went to <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſora</hi> again, there lived for one year as happy as two mortals could be; but in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year 1736; ſhe died of the ſmall pox, and to divert my mind, it came into my head to go to ſea, and make ſome voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in my own little ſhip, which was an excellent one for ſtrength and ſailing, tho' but a ſloop of twenty-five tons. I went captain myſelf, and had an ingenious young gentleman, one <hi>Jackman,</hi> for my mate, who had been in the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> ſeveral times, ſix good hands, and two cabbin-boys. Every thing neceſſary, convenient, and fit, books, mathematical inſtruments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we took on board, and weighed anchor the 5th of <hi>July,</hi> 1736.</p>
               <p>We went on ſhore at the <hi>Canary Iſlands,</hi> the <hi>Cape de Verd Iſlands,</hi> and other places. We paſſed the Sun in 15 degrees North latitude, and from that time ſtanding South; croſſed the <hi>Line;</hi> the heats intolerable, and the muſquitoes and bugs inſufferable. We ſoon loſt ſight of the <hi>Northern</hi> ſtar, and had the <hi>Croſiers</hi> and <hi>Magellan</hi> clouds in view. In three months time we anchored at <hi>St. Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>'s on the coaſt of <hi>Brazil.</hi> The 2d of <hi>December</hi> we ſaw the <hi>Streights la Maine,</hi> that run betwixt <hi>Terra del fuego</hi> and <hi>Staten,</hi> and is the boundary between the <hi>Atlantic</hi> and <hi>Pacific</hi> oceans; but inſtead of venturing into
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:0028500202:542" rendition="simple:additions"/>them, and hazarding our lives among the impetuous blaſts and waves which ſweep round <hi>Cape Horn,</hi> (as Admiral <hi>Anſon</hi> did the 7th of <hi>March</hi> 1741, two months too late, by the fault of the miniſtry, in his way to the <hi>South Seas</hi>), we kept out at ſea to the Eaſt of <hi>Staten-land,</hi> and ran to the latitude 64, before we ſtood to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

               </p>
               <p>Nine years of my life was ſpent in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling and ſailing about, and at laſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to reſt and reflect, and in rational a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements paſs the remainder of my time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I retired to a little flowery retreat I had purchaſed within a few miles of <hi>London,</hi> that I might eaſily know what was doing in this hemiſphere, while I belong to it; and in the midſt of groves and ſtreams, fields and
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:0028500202:543"/>lawns, have lived as happily ever ſince, as a mortal can do on this <hi>Planet.</hi>

                        <hi>Law</hi> was the moſt amazing compound I have ever ſeen.

His temper was charming, ſweet, and delightful; and his manners quite primitive and uncommonly pious: He was all charity and goodneſs, and ſo ſoft and gentle in converſation, that I have thought myſelf in company with one of the men of the firſt church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> while with him. He had likewiſe the juſteſt notions of <hi>chriſtian temper</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> and recommended them in ſo inſinuating a manner, that even a rake would hear him with pleaſure. I have not ſeen any like him among the ſons of men in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. It was wrong to put him in the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> and call him <hi>one Law,</hi> as <hi>Pope</hi> does. He was really a very
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:0028500202:544"/>extraordinary man; and to his honour be it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that he had the great concern of human life at heart, took a deal of pains in the pulpit, and from the preſs, (witneſs his two fine books on a devout life,) to make men fear God and keep his commandments. He was a good man indeed.</p>
                     <p>But what ſtrange books did he write! His <hi>Appeal to the Deiſts</hi> — His <hi>Spirit of Prayer and Love</hi> — His <hi>earneſt and ſerious Anſwer to Trapp</hi> — His <hi>Notes and Illuſtrations on Behmen</hi> — His <hi>Replies to Hoadley;</hi> and, what is ſtranger ſtill, his <hi>abuſe</hi> of biſhop <hi>Hoadley,</hi> in his <hi>Appeal</hi> I have mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Here, had I room, I would relate a very curious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation that paſſed between Dr. <hi>Theophilus Bolton,</hi> archbiſhop of <hi>Caſhell</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (a moſt excellent, moſt ſenſible, and moſt learned man,) and me, (at the third night's ſale of archbiſhop <hi>King</hi>'s library in <hi>Dublin,</hi>) in relation to Mr. <hi>Law.</hi> It happened on his Lordſhip's buying <hi>Jacob Behmen</hi>'s <hi>Works</hi> for a pound, and then aſking me, who ſtood by him, if I had read them, and could enable him to underſtand them?

<pb n="529" facs="tcp:0028500202:544"/>the ocean round the globe, from Weſt to Eaſt, and from the Southern latitude 64, to 66 North; a <hi>Planet</hi> in reality ſo <hi>divinely made</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> that one can never ſufficiently adore and praiſe an <hi>infinitely wiſe God</hi> for ſuch a piece of his <hi>handy work:</hi> — A <hi>world</hi> ſo <hi>wiſely contrived,</hi> ſo <hi>accurately made,</hi> as to <hi>demonſtrate</hi> the <hi>Creator</hi>'s <hi>being and attributes,</hi> and cauſe every rational mortal to acknowledge that <hi>Jehovah</hi> is our <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>tremendous a Being</hi> — the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>glory of our God.</hi>

               <p>But as I was ſaying, after my return, I bought a little ſpot and country-houſe, where I might reſt from my labours, and eaſily

               <p>To hear ſuch news; and know what <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> are doing; — and what the renowned <hi>Anti-Sejanus</hi> is writing; (<hi>Anti-Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus</hi> who deſerves the curſe and hatred of the whole community<note n="*" place="bottom">As an abetter of arbitrary power, and for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to raiſe the prerogative.</note>) I purchaſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement near the capital; a ſpot ſurrounded with woods and ſtreams, plants and flowers; and over which a ſilence hovers, that gives a reliſh to ſtill life, and renders it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt to the buſy, buſtling, envious crowds of men.</p>
