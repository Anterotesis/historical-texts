            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE ſad duty of publiſhing the poſthumous works of a revered Parent having devolved on me, I now preſent the Public with two volumes of the continuation of the "OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE," which comprehend a view of the intereſting countries of China, Japan, New Holland, and the Archipelago of the Indian Ocean.</p>
            <p>As an editor, my chief care has been to tranſcribe with accuracy from the original manuſcript. The finiſhing touch of the maſter may be wanting; but the hand, alas! which gave the glowing tint is now cold, and who ſhall dare to uſurp the pencil! Some trifling additions, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by an initial, have been made by myſelf; and to <hi>John Latham,</hi> Eſquire, I am indebted for an augmentation to the catalogue of Birds of China, and of New Holland.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0792500103:4"/>An objection may be made by ſome, that no plates adorn theſe volumes—engravings, except of novel objects, or really illuſtrative, and ſuch, notwithſtanding much exertion, it was not my good fortune to procure, tend little to the value of a work of ſcience. Two maps, preſumed more requiſite, have been conſtructed from the beſt materials.</p>
            <p>The biography of the valued Author of the following ſheets, having been given by himſelf in his "Literary Life," to the commencement of the year 1793, little remains for me to add. To that period his health and felicity had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced little interruption; the illneſs of an amiable daughter then began to embitter his days, and, after the moſt unremitting attention that parental fondneſs could dictate, he felt the cruel pang of ſeparation, on the firſt of May 1794; this ſhock his ſpirits never completely recovered. In the April of the enſuing year, the patella of the knee ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, while deſcending a flight of ſteps, an accident which confined him long to his room, yet, notwithſtanding his advanced age, and the bones never again reuniting, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0792500103:5"/>ſufficiently not only to walk without difficulty, but to purſue his uſual exerciſe on horſeback.</p>
            <p>The year 1796 gave to the world his "Account of the pariſhes of Whitford and Holywell." The infirmities of nature now began to ſhew themſelves more evidently. The loſs of a friend and neighbor, the worthy Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn,</hi> the ſubſequent diſtractions of the county of Flint by jarring politics, the melancholy ſituation of public affairs, the progreſs of Gallic barbariſm, which threatened to overturn all inſtitutions ſocial and ſacred, operated too forcibly on a mind of the acuteſt feeling and moſt exquiſite ſenſibility. Mental agitation affected the corporeal ſyſtem; a difficulty of breathing, a cough, and other pulmonary affections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to apply for medical aid, and he received from his friend Dr. <hi>Haygarth,</hi> then reſident at Cheſter, all the aſſiſtance that art could give. Conſiderable diſcharges of blood from the noſe increaſed the alarming ſymptoms; ſtill the energy of his mind ſuſtained itſelf; he continued his literary purſuits, and employed his leiſure hours, during the
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0792500103:6"/>greateſt part of 1797, in preparing for the preſs, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as perfect as poſſible, his intereſting "VIEW OF HIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOOSTAN," which was publiſhed early in the following year. OEdematous ſwellings in the legs announced the fatal cauſe of his diſeaſe; but to expatiate more minutely on the ſad catalogue of human evils might be irkſome; ſuffice it then to ſay, that he bore their trial with fortitude and reſignation; a natural ſtrength of conſtitution, aided by a life of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form temperance, enabled him long to ſtruggle againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity. The progreſs of the diſorder becoming more rapid, towards the cloſe of October he collected his neareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and received with them the myſterious ſeal of our Redemption; conſcious of his approaching end, his eye beamed with hope, tempered by the moſt ſerene and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied reſignation; combining charity with devotion, he obſerved, that the ceremony would be incomplete indeed, were it not accompanied by an act of beneficence to the poor. This was the laſt duty of religion he performed; his life had been a preparation for the aweful concluſion.
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0792500103:7"/>Though ſoon after reduced to the inability of moving, and ſuffering much, he continued to ſhare the converſation of his friends and relations, except during the extreme preſſure of pain, or when opiates, employed to procure a diſturbed ſleep, or relieve the body from a few pangs, produced their powerful effect, and ſacrificed the reaſoning powers and the nobler faculties of the ſoul. On the 16th of December 1798, the powers of nature were exhauſted, and the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated author of my being expired without a groan!</p>
            <p>The pen of a ſon may not be calculated to record the character of an affectionate and beloved parent; the bias of natural affection may operate too forcibly, yet the ſilence of the perſon moſt intimately acquainted with the various virtues of <hi>Thomas Pennant,</hi> would juſtly draw down the reproach of ingratitude.</p>
            <p>His religious principles were pure and fervent, yet exempt from bigotry; though firmly attached to the eſtabliſhed church, he, by his writings and conduct, conciliated the eſteem of thoſe of a different perſuaſion. A ſteady
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0792500103:8"/>friend to our excellent conſtitution, he ever labored to preſerve it entire; this induced him to petition for the reform of ſome abuſes during the adminiſtration of Lord <hi>North,</hi> at a period when the influence of the crown was ſuppoſed to have exceeded its due bounds; this brought him forward in later times, with additional energy, to reſiſt the democratic ſpirit, which menaced tenfold evils. The duties of a magiſtrate he exerciſed with candor, with a temperate yet zealous warmth to protect the oppreſſed. His benevolence to the poor was unbounded, his repeated exertions to relieve the wants of a populous neighbourhood, by the importation of corn, in times of ſcarcity, were truly munificent. Temperate in diet, he enjoyed the fruits of abſtinence, and, until a few years previous to his deceaſe, poſſeſſed an unuſual ſhare of health and vigor. His conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was lively, replete with inſtruction, and brilliant with ſallies of true humour; yet too great ſenſiblity at times lowered his natural flow of ſpirits, and occaſioned ſevere dejection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0792500103:9"/>Of his literary character the public is the impartial judge, and that public not only in this, but in foreign countries has fixed on it the ſtamp of approbation. Bleſſed with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the moſt retentive, his powers of compoſition were rapid; his works were generally printed, as they flowed from the pen, with little or no correction, hence, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracies may be expected, but their numbers are trifling.</p>
            <p>Such, candid Reader! is the true but imperfect ſketch of the character of a man who to ſuperior talents united the utmoſt goodneſs of heart.</p>
            <p>Accept, ſainted ſpirit! this unavailing tribute of filial duty! May the example of thy virtues ſtimulate my exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! May my latter end reſemble thine!</p>

               <head>INDIA EXTRA GANGEM.</head>
               <p>I NOW enter on that portion of <hi>India</hi> which is diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>India</hi> beyond the <hi>Ganges.</hi> The diſtinction is comparatively modern, being known to the antients in an imperfect manner. Here and there are ſcattered a few names, which they could only have collected from the <hi>Indian</hi> navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators; but I ſhall mention in courſe any other lights which I diſcover they might have received.</p>
               <p>ADJOINING to <hi>Chittigong</hi> is the kingdom of <hi>Aracan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">KINGDOM OF ARACAN.</note> which extends along the bay of <hi>Bengal</hi> about two hundred miles in a ſouth-eaſtern direction. According to Mr. <hi>Rennel</hi>'s map, a chain of mountains, beginning in the ſouthern part of <hi>Chittigong</hi> ſkirts the ſea the whole length of this kingdom, as well as that of <hi>Ava,</hi> to within a few leagues of <hi>Cape Negrais.</hi> The whole tract is infeſted to a very great degree with elephants and beaſts of prey. The topography of this country is very obſcure. The mouth of the river <hi>Aracan,</hi> the <hi>Tocoſannae</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RIVER.</note> is placed in Lat. 20° 12′. M. <hi>D'Anville</hi> gives its whole courſe. Mr. <hi>Rennel,</hi> more cautious, and, perhaps, conſcious of the uncertainty, only
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0792500103:18"/>delineates a ſmall part,
<note place="margin">ARACAN.</note> or from the capital, <hi>Aracan,</hi> to the ſea. From <hi>Aracan,</hi> as high as Lat. 26°, with the exception of a ſmall portion between <hi>Malaac</hi> and <hi>Munnypour,</hi> where it is traverſed by the great communication from <hi>Ava</hi> to the northern parts of <hi>Bengal,</hi> it is marked with a dotted line; from that point the river is diſtinguiſhed by a certain courſe, which is continued northward, in the kingdom of <hi>Thibet,</hi> as high as Lat. 30° 10′. All the great tract it paſſes through is level, which makes it liable to annual inundations, from the ſame cauſes as affect the <hi>Bengal</hi> and other of the <hi>Indian</hi> plains. The tides which run up this river are very high; they come in with a great bore, and riſe from fifteen to twenty feet, according to the influence of the moon.</p>
               <p>THERE is ſix fathom water, according to Mr. <hi>Ovington</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, at the entrance of the river, and twenty farther up, ſo that it forms a noble harbour. From the mouth to the capital is about fifty miles; moſt of the way deliciouſly bounded by woods or plantations, animated by the gambols of the monkey tribe, or the gay flights of numbers of peacocks. The city of <hi>Aracan</hi> is ſeated moſt ſingularly, in a valley ſurrounded with vaſt and craggy mountains. Theſe are aſſiſted by art, ſo as to prove the moſt ſubſtantial fortifications. The entrances are cut through the ſolid rock, as are the gates of the city. The precipitous face of the mountains ſerves for walls; beſides theſe, it has a citadel, and other artificial defences. The city is ſaid to be fifteen miles in circumference, and to contain a hundred and ſixty thouſand inhabitants. The regal palace is very magnificent, and highly adorned and enriched with works of maſſive gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0792500103:19"/>IN my
<note n="*" place="bottom">Outlines of the Globe, vol. ii. p. 372.</note> account of <hi>Chittigong,</hi> in the preceding volume, I have related the ſhare this kingdom took in the affairs of <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> by reaſon of the ſupport it gave the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> pirates. I ſhall now take notice of a very remarkable event which befel <hi>Aracan,</hi> the reſult of the misfortunes of <hi>Sultan Sujah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">OF SULTAN SULJAH.</note> the ſecond ſon of the emperor <hi>Shah Jehan,</hi> and the unfortunate brother of that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful hypocrite <hi>Aurengzebe.</hi> After <hi>Sujah</hi> had long made head againſt the uſurper, he was at length obliged to retire from his faſtneſs near <hi>Monghier</hi> to <hi>Dacca,</hi> and from thence to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Aracan.</hi> He had previouſly ſent his ſon to the king of the country, to implore his protection. This was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately promiſed, and the unhappy prince embarked with his whole family on board the veſſels of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> pirates, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the mouths of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> intending to profit of the favor of the infidel monarch, till he could procure a ſhip to convey him to the holy city of <hi>Mecca.</hi> From thence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to go to the courts of <hi>Turky</hi> or <hi>Perſia,</hi> in hopes of an aſylum in one or other of the dominions of thoſe mighty poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates. <hi>Sujah</hi> is ſaid ſoon to have diſcovered the perfidy of his royal hoſt, who had entered into a treaty with the General of <hi>Aurengzebe,</hi> to deliver into his hands, for a ſum of money, the fugitive ſultan. This came to the ears of that prince, who raſhly determined on revenge. He entered into a conſpiracy againſt the <hi>Aracan</hi> monarch, gained over a certain number of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> reſident in the country, and with thoſe, and the few who were left of his train, reſolved to force his way into the palace, to kill the king, and cauſe himſelf to be proclamed ſovereign.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0792500103:20"/>All this might have been executed,
<note place="margin">ARACAN.</note> had not the deſign been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. The unhappy <hi>Sujah</hi> attempted to eſcape towards <hi>Pegu;</hi> he was ſoon overtaken. His ſon, ſultan <hi>Banque,</hi> defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a courage worthy of his birth, till overpowered with numbers, and fainting under his wounds, he was ſeized, and with his two little brothers, his ſiſters, and his mother, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away. As to <hi>Sujah,</hi> he, with one woman, an eunuch, and two other perſons, in aſcending a mountain, was knocked down with a ſtone by his purſuers. The eunuch bound up his wounded head with a turban, and they both eſcaped into the woods. Many relations were ſpread reſpecting this event. In general he was ſuppoſed to have died either famiſhed with hunger, or fallen a prey to wild beaſts. Mr. <hi>Dalrymple</hi> had picked up a ſtory, that <hi>Sujah</hi> eſcaped to <hi>Soolo,</hi> an iſle between that of <hi>Borneo</hi> and <hi>Magindanao,</hi> where he long led an eremitical life; that he died there, and that a tomb was erected over his grave, to this day an object of veneration with the <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE tragical relation does not end here. Sultan <hi>Banque,</hi> and other fugitives who were brought back, were at firſt treated with a tolerable degree of lenity; the king even took to wife one of <hi>Sujah</hi>'s daughters. This did not prevent <hi>Banque</hi> and his companions from entering into another conſpiracy, which was detected. The king of <hi>Aracan</hi> determined to root out this ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fated family; he cauſed the heads of the men to be cut off with blunt axes, the women to be immured, and ſtarved to death; the lady alone whom he had honored with his bed was ſaved.</p>
               <p>THE great quantity of gold and diamonds which had been brought into the country by <hi>Sujah,</hi> proved the cauſe of dreadful
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0792500103:21"/>wars between the two ſons of the king of <hi>Aracan,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in 1690; they quarrelled about the diviſion of the treaſure, and never ceaſed from conteſting the prize till both the competitors were deſtroyed. Many of the diamonds (as is ſuppoſed) were afterwards ſold to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who happened to touch at <hi>Aracan,</hi> at very low prices, by reaſon of the ignorance of the poſſeſſors.</p>
               <p>THE next kingdom is that of <hi>Ava.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">KINGDOM OF AVA.</note> I ſhall comprehend in it three; that of <hi>Ava</hi> proper, <hi>Buraghmah,</hi> or, as it is vulgarly called, <hi>Burmah,</hi> and <hi>Pegu.</hi> They once formed ſo many inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſtates, governed by their reſpective monarchs; but are now by conqueſt conſolidated into one, being ſubdued by the king of <hi>Burmagh.</hi> His dominions extend from the province of <hi>Yunan,</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> as far ſouth as the mouths of the <hi>Ava,</hi> a tract of eight hundred miles. The ſtandard of <hi>Mahomet</hi> was never erected in theſe kingdoms; all the inhabitants are rank idolaters; their mode of worſhip and their rites agree in many points with thoſe of the <hi>Hindoos,</hi> and they allow the doctrine of tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their pagodas, and thoſe of <hi>Pegu,</hi> very much reſemble in form that of a bell tent. The more northern part is the kingdom of <hi>Burmagh;</hi> that of <hi>Meckly,</hi> tributary to it, forms on our maps a large vacant ſpace to the weſt, divided by a vaſt chain of mountains from <hi>Silhet</hi> and <hi>Tipera. Roſhuan,</hi> another void, is to the ſouth of <hi>Meckly.</hi> The kingdom of <hi>Aracan</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates <hi>Burmagh,</hi> for a conſiderable extent, from the eaſtern part of the bay of <hi>Bengal.</hi> The coaſt of <hi>Ava</hi> ſucceeds, and runs, waſhed by the ſea, as far as <hi>Cape Negrais,</hi> an extent of above two hundred miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0792500103:22"/>THE great river <hi>Ava</hi> takes its riſe far beyond the province of <hi>Yunan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RIVER AVA.</note> in <hi>China,</hi> and, as is ſuppoſed, in <hi>Thibet.</hi> The <hi>Chineſe</hi> call it <hi>Hou-kian.</hi> I am uncertain where it becomes navigable, poſſibly at the laſt cuſtom-houſe in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> dominions; at leaſt we find, that four people of that nation, with ſome others, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked there on a voyage made in the laſt century down that river. We have an account of it in vol. vii. 123, of the <hi>Univerſal Hiſtory.</hi> It is deſcribed, even at the cuſtom-houſe, as a large and rapid river. They were twenty days in ſailing to the city of <hi>Ava,</hi> and a month more from thence to <hi>Pegu.</hi> Below the capital of the kingdom, the veſſels which navigate this mighty river are ſaid to be as large as our biggeſt ſhips, without ſail, but the planks have neither peg or nail to faſten them; they ſeem to be ſewed, like the Arabian veſſels, which will be deſcribed in vol. of this work.</p>
               <p>MR. DALRYMPLE, in p. 112 of his uſeful Repertory, ſays, he is aſſured, that the river paſſes through a great lake, not far above the city of <hi>Ava.</hi> This lake, in the old maps, ſuch as <hi>Speed</hi>'s,
<note place="margin">LAKE OF CHIAMAY.</note> is called <hi>Chiamay,</hi> and it is ſuppoſed that the rivers of <hi>Siam,</hi> and poſſibly of <hi>Aracan, Chittigong,</hi> and ſome others, flow out of it. The river is deſcribed as difficult of navigation, by reaſon of ripplings and overfalls; and its water, during the inundations, very cold, occaſioned by the ſnowy mountains from whence it flows.</p>
               <p>THE borders of the <hi>Ava,</hi> after it enters <hi>Burmagh,</hi> are in ſome parts flat, in others hilly, but in none ſo low as to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed. The neighbouring grounds are replete with ſaltpetre, and quantities of common ſalt are procured by lixiviation from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0792500103:23"/>a black earth which abounds in this diſtrict. It is now called the <hi>Irabathy. Munchaboo,</hi> the royal reſidence of the king of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> ſtands about twelve miles from the weſtern bank, in Lat. 23° 38′, a walled town, of a ſquare form, containing four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand families.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ava,</hi> the capital of the kingdom of the ſame name,
<note place="margin">AVA CITY.</note> is ſeated in Lat. 21° 48′, on the eaſtern bank of the river, about 38 miles below <hi>Munchaboo.</hi> It is a very large city, built of wood, the ſtreets ſtrait, and planted on each ſide with trees. The king's palace alone is of ſtone, but mean in its architecture. It was in the ſixteenth century prodigiouſly populous, but was laid waſte by the king of <hi>Pegu</hi> in the moſt ſavage manner. <hi>Purchas</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. ii. 1728.</note> gives the horrible relation. The jewellers of <hi>Europe</hi> viſited it in the ſame century, for the ſake of its rich gems. At preſent <hi>Ava</hi> is in a moſt ruinous ſtate, and does not contain above a thouſand families. The kingdom produces ſapphires and rubies of the higheſt quality. Mention is made of its rich mines of copper, lead, and ſilver. Other provinces are rich in gold.</p>
               <p>FROM the city the river aſſumes the ſame name of <hi>Ava,</hi> takes a ſmall curvature from thence towards the weſt, and the channel becomes full of iſles. Near <hi>Pegongmew,</hi> a town ſeated in a ſterile ſandy country, and which, from the remains of numerous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godas, ſeems formerly to have been a place of importance, the <hi>Ava</hi> takes a more ſoutherly courſe. Between Lat. 20° and 19° north,
<note place="margin">TEEK WOODS.</note> the weſtern ſide is filled with an immenſe foreſt of teek trees, which is ſaid to produce the beſt timber of any in <hi>India;</hi> it is floated down the river, and is a conſiderable article of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0792500103:24"/>
                  <hi>Prone,</hi> once encloſed with fortifications, lies on the left bank, and is one of the principal trading towns on its courſe; the environs are extremely fertile.</p>
               <p>AT <hi>Lundſey,</hi>

               <p>THE great branch of the <hi>Delta</hi> is immediately to the eaſt of <hi>Cape Negrais.</hi> It is called the <hi>Perſaim</hi> river, from a town ſeated about ſeventy miles from the ſea, on its eaſtern banks. In 1758 we had a factory on the oppoſite ſide. The channel is very wide and deep, having moſt of the way ſix and ſeven fathoms of water. On each ſide are navigable canals, that probably inſulate part of the flat country to the eaſt and to the weſt. On the eaſtern part there is an inland communication from this river quite to that of <hi>Pegu,</hi> or the <hi>Siriam</hi> river, as there is through the <hi>Sunderbunds</hi> of <hi>Bengal.</hi>

<note place="margin">CITY.</note> The capital city
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0792500103:29"/>ſtands on the eaſtern bank, in about Lat. 18° 8′. In its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity it conſiſted of two parts, the old and the new; the laſt was the royal reſidence, and completed about the year 1567, by <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daragri,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Burmagh</hi> king. A tyrant monarch aroſe, who oppreſſed his ſubjects to ſuch a degree, as to encourage the neighboring princes to invade his dominions, and in 1596, he was beſieged by them in his capital. The <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with certain Turks, cauſed the ſiege to be raiſed, but out of a hundred and fifty thouſand inhabitants, only thirty thouſand were left, all the others periſhed, either by the ſword or famine; it had at that time three thouſand cannon for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, of which one thouſand were braſs. The kings of <hi>Aracan</hi> and <hi>Tangu</hi> took advantage of his diſtreſs, the city was again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, ſurrendered to the latter, and the unfortunate monarch, and his whole family, put to death by order of his own ſiſter, queen to the victorious king; the place was foon deſerted, and the ſeat of empire transferred to <hi>Ava.</hi> The city of <hi>Pegu</hi> was of vaſt ſize, a regular ſquare, with four grand ſtreets leading to four gates, and being ſeated on a plain, a perſon at the center could ſee them all at once, though the city was a mile each way. The houſes were built with bamboo; it was ſurrounded with walls, and a deep wet ditch, ſtocked with crocodiles,
<note place="margin">CROCODILES.</note> to prevent people attempting to get in or out of the city by ſwimming or wading.</p>
               <p>THE bore, or head wave of the tide,
<note place="margin">BORE, OR HEAD WAVE.</note> which runs up this river is of amazing violence and rapidity; people who have the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of being ſhipwrecked on the banks near the ſhore, at low water or ebb of tide, are obliged to ſeek the land with all poſſible ſpeed, for fear leſt they ſhould be ſwept away. On its entering
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0792500103:30"/>the channels and the mouths of rivers, the noiſe is moſt tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous. The bore is ſaid to be ſixteen feet high; the barks which run up the <hi>Pegu</hi> river, are carried with the rapidity of an arrow out of a bow. If they cannot finiſh their voyage in a tide, they anchor on ſome of the numerous ſand banks with which the river is filled. The expanſion of the tide on thoſe elevated parts leſſens the danger; as ſoon as the barks begin to be lifted up, they prepare for their voyage. At a certain time the mariners looſen their anchors, and are carried on as I deſcribe. If they, or even the largeſt ſhips, lay in the channel, they would certainly be overſet, and the crew and the cargo at once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the wave; for this reaſon, large ſhips ſeldom ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to navigate this river, but diſcharge their lading at <hi>Siriam,</hi> from whence it was wont to be conveyed to <hi>Pegu</hi> in barks.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Portugueſe</hi> very ſoon got conſiderable intereſt in this country, but by their profligate conduct were expelled by the reigning monarch.
<note place="margin">SYLVEIRA, HIS SAD FATE.</note> One <hi>Thomas Sylveira</hi> had by his valor done conſiderable ſervice to the king in the <hi>Siameſe</hi> wars; he became a prime favorite, had his ſtate elephant and body-guard allowed; till one day paſſing through the ſtreets, and hearing the mirth of nuptial merriment in a burgher's houſe, ſtopped at the door, and underſtanding that the bride was a virgin of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beauty, requeſted a ſight of her; the bridegroom, thinking it an extraordinary honor, brought her to the ſide of <hi>Sylveira</hi>'s elephant; the ruſſian cauſed her to be ſeized, and carried to his houſe. The unhappy bridegroom, unable to ſuſtain his loſs, cut his throat; the relations rent their cloaths, and ran through the ſtreets, appealing to their gods and monarch for revenge. The king heard the complaint, cauſed <hi>Sylveira</hi> to be ſeized, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0792500103:31"/>to be dragged at the foot of an elephant through the ſtreets till neither ſkin or fleſh were left on his bones, and all the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> in <hi>Pegu,</hi> except the few who could eſcape by flight, were inſtantly maſſacred.</p>

It had formerly been the moſt flouriſhing commercial town of the Eaſt, and ſtill retains its potteries and manufactures, jars glazed with lead ore, large enough to contain two hogſheads. <hi>Hamilton</hi> alſo mentions its fiſheries, and adds, that its dried mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets exceed in delicacy all fiſh of the kind.</p>
               <p>FROM the mouth of the <hi>Martaban</hi> harbor, the courſe runs due ſouth, as far as the iſle of <hi>Junkſeilon,</hi>

<note place="margin">TOWN OF MERGUI.</note> The town of <hi>Mergui</hi> ſtands on an iſland in the mouth of the river <hi>Tenaſſerim,</hi> in Lat. 12° 12′; it was once a moſt flouriſhing emporium, till it was, by the tyranny of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, almoſt totally deſerted, and the whole neighborhood became the habitation of wild beaſts. <hi>Mergui</hi> was, at the cloſe of the laſt century, much frequented by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; but they were recalled by the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> company.

               <p>ALL the iſles are mountanous, and may be ſeen in clear weather at the diſtance of fourteen or fifteen leagues, and moſt of them finely wooded: many of the trees are very lofty; among them is the <hi>Poon tree,</hi> or <hi>Uvaria Altiſſima,</hi> ſo uſeful for maſts, and the <hi>Coco</hi> palm, of ſuch univerſal uſe in all parts of <hi>India.</hi> In <hi>Pegu,</hi> the nut is eſteemed a neceſſary of life, nearly as much as rice.</p>
               <p>THE iſlands are of various ſizes and forms, but generally very ſmall; many exactly of the ſhape of a bee-hive, and clothed with woods; a few are very rocky, and ſo rudely broken, as to ſeem flung up by a mighty convulſion; ſuch are the rocks called the <hi>Cupelo.</hi> The largeſt iſles are <hi>St. Mathews, St. Suſannas,</hi> and <hi>Sullivans,</hi> or the <hi>Domel.</hi> Among them are ſome very good harbors, particularly <hi>Haſtings</hi> Bay, in the iſle of <hi>St. Mathew.</hi>

The ſame writer, from the report of a native who had been taken priſoner when young by ſome <hi>Nicobarians,</hi> and was converted to Mahometaniſm, made frequent voyages to his native iſlands, and often returned with four or five hundred weight of quickſilver, with which he ſaid they abounded.</p>
               <p>THE whole of the greater <hi>Andaman</hi> is ſkirted with ſmall iſlands. Mr. <hi>Dalrymple</hi> makes mention of a cluſter inhabited by

He repreſents the natives as honeſt, civil, and harmleſs, huſband of one wife, and, according to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> rule, till death doth them part. They are neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to quarrel, theft, or murder; in their perſons they are tall and well-limbed, their viſages long, noſes well proportioned, and their whole features agreeable, their hair lank and black, their ſkins a deep copper; the men go naked, excepting the wrapper which paſſes round their waiſt, and from thence under the thighs, and brought ſo as to tuck before. The women wear a ſhort petticoat not reaching lower than the knee.</p>
               <p>THESE people have neither an apparent government or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; each man is patriarchal, the ruler of his own family. Their property conſiſts in the plantations of coco palms,
<note place="margin">COCO TREES.</note> which are along the ſhores; the country inland ſeemed not cleared, and impervious by any paths.</p>
               <p>THEY have another tree of uſe, which they call the <hi>Melory;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MELORY.</note> it grows wild: <hi>Dampier,</hi> who was very obſervant, ſays he never ſaw any in other parts of his travels; he adds, it grows to the ſize of our larger apple trees; that the fruit is as big as a penny loaf, of the ſhape of a pear, with a ſmooth greeniſh rind; the inſide is like that of an apple, but full of ſmall ſtrings: it is their chief food; they either eat it boiled, or ſcrape the pulp clear from the ſtrings, and make it into a cake as large as a <hi>Dutch</hi> cheeſe, which will keep ſix or ſeven days, and has a good taſte; they have a few ſmall hogs, and ſome poultry.</p>
               <p>THE principal employ of the natives is fiſhing: their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes are ſharp at each end; flat on one ſide, and convex on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0792500103:38"/>the other, and have ſome ſlight outriggers. Theſe veſſels go either with a ſail or paddle, and hold from nine to thirty men.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Nicobar</hi> iſlands produce the beautiful and ſingular pigeon,
<note place="margin">PIGEON.</note> to which they give name; the feathers on the head are purple, thoſe of the neck, long, narrow, and ſharp-pointed like the hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of a cock, and reflecting various gloſſes of purple, red, gold, blue, and copper; the back a changeable green; the primaries a fine blue; the tail and its coverts white.</p>

               <p>THE little <hi>Quedah</hi> turtle

               </p>
               <p>THE next place of note on the coaſt, is a great tract of flat
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0792500103:40"/>land, inſulated by ſeveral channels, which form various iſles, and open by different mouths into the ſea.</p>
               <p>THE greater iſle,

               <p>FARTHER to the ſouth, in Lat. 2° 50′, the ſtreights contract in breadth very conſiderably.
<note place="margin">PULO ARU.</note> The ſmall iſles <hi>Pulo Aru</hi> are in the middle of the channel, which here begins to be greatly nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed by rocks and banks on each ſhore. On the <hi>Malacca</hi> ſide, to the ſouth-eaſt of <hi>Pulo Aru,</hi> is a large bay, filled with flat moraſſy iſles, divided by very narrow channels. On one of the moſt ſouthern of them ſtands <hi>Mount Parcelar,</hi> a noted ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to ſhips navigating this dangerous ſtreight.</p>
               <p>STILL more to the ſouth,
<note place="margin">MALACCA CITY.</note> in Lat. 2° 20′, is <hi>Malacca,</hi> the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital city of the peninſula; it probably ſucceeded <hi>Perimula</hi> as the emporium of this part of <hi>India.</hi> When the great <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> had made his country ſovereign of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> he turned his thoughts towards this territory, and determined to give to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> the whole commerce of the Eaſt. At that time <hi>Malacca</hi> poſſeſſed the entire trade of <hi>India;</hi> ſhips from every port of <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> from <hi>China,</hi> the <hi>Phillipine</hi> and the <hi>Molucca</hi> iſlands,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0792500103:41"/>from <hi>Perſia, Arabia,</hi> and even <hi>Africa,</hi> filled its harbor.

               </p>
               <p>THIS port was firſt viſited in 1508 by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Lopez Sequiera.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TAKEN BY THE PORTUGUESE.</note> On his arrival he met with the moſt friendly reception from the reigning monarch; but ſuch a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy aroſe among the commercial people of the different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſpecially the <hi>Arabs,</hi> which they ſo effectually inſtilled into the prince, as ſoon to deſtroy the good underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the ſtrangers he had ſo ſuddenly taken an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for. His conduct had lulled the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> into ſo deep a ſecurity, that numbers of them took up their reſidence in the city, and <hi>Sequiera</hi> even appointed <hi>Araujo,</hi> a favorite of <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi>'s, as conſul. The prince did not dare to attack the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral by open force, but uſed every ſpecies of treachery to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him. Finding his plots detected, he ordered his ſubjects to maſſacre the <hi>Europeans</hi> who were in their power. Numbers were ſlain; but <hi>Araujo</hi> and a few others were kept as hoſtages to prevent the revenge of the admiral, who, after various endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to recover them, was obliged to leave them behind, and to ſet ſail for the <hi>Malabar</hi> coaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albuquerque</hi> took advantage of the quarrel; he ſailed from <hi>Goa</hi> in 1511, and ſoon appearing before the port of <hi>Malacca,</hi> clamed the releaſe of his countrymen. Theſe demands were at firſt refuſed; but after ſome hoſtilities, the king was ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as to ſend to <hi>Albuquerque, Araujo</hi> and all the ſurviving <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe.</hi> Notwithſtanding this, it was diſcovered that he intended
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0792500103:42"/>nothing leſs than the deſtruction of the <hi>Europeans.</hi> It is evident he had great reaſon to ſuſpect his new gueſts, for <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> among other requeſts, deſired leave to erect a fort to ſecure his countrymen from any future attacks. This the king knew was only a prelude to the ſubjection of him and his ſubjects to a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign yoke. The refuſal was followed by the landing of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe;</hi> ſeveral ſevere ſkirmiſhes enſued, which, as uſual, ended with the defeat of the <hi>Indians.</hi> The city was forced, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace taken by ſtorm, but though the king found means to eſcape with all his valuable effects, <hi>Albuquerque</hi> got two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ducats to his ſhare of the plunder. Among other means of reſiſtance, the <hi>Malayes</hi> placed in the way of the aſſailants a ſort of <hi>chevaux de frize</hi> with poiſoned points. No people are ſo expert as the <hi>Malayes</hi> in that dreadful art. The city was alſo defended by three thouſand cannon, a number of artillery ſurpriſing in thoſe days. The monarch fled to the woods, where he ſoon died of grief. This ſucceſs of <hi>Albuquerque</hi>'s ſtruck all the neighboring nations with admiration. The king of <hi>Siam,</hi> and the princes of <hi>Sumatra</hi> and <hi>Java,</hi> and the other neighboring iſles, ſent to him embaſſadors, and various rich preſents. Thoſe from <hi>Java</hi> very politically preſented him with ſpears and darts, all kinds of hoſtile weapons, and pieces of embroidery repreſenting the warlike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of their maſter, to impreſs on the ſtranger an idea of the valor of the <hi>Javaneſe</hi> monarch.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Portugueſe</hi> from time to time fortified <hi>Malacca</hi> in a manner ſuitable to its importance, and it became the greateſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porium in <hi>India.</hi> By this wiſe ſtroke of policy, <hi>Albuquerque</hi> gave to his country the poſſeſſion of the gold, the gems, the ſpices,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0792500103:43"/>and other rich productions of <hi>India ultra Gangem,</hi> and its iſlands, as he did before thoſe of <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> by the capture of the famous city of <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Portugueſe</hi> continued in poſſeſſion of <hi>Malacca</hi> till the year 1641,
<note place="margin">EXPELLED BY THE DUTCH.</note> when it was wreſted out of their hands by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> after a ſix months ſiege. The governor is accuſed by hiſtorians of treachery, and to have been bribed into a ſurrender; but it is certain that he did not give the place up till after the moſt gallant defence. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſenſible of its value, paid the utmoſt attention to its fortifications, and to every thing that could revive the antient commerce, which had almoſt ſunk to nothing, by the tyranny and uſual ill conduct of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE city had in their time ſeveral fine churches, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of monaſteries; and the Jeſuits a noble college, in which they exerciſed great hoſpitality. All theſe of courſe fell to decay under the reign of the ſons of <hi>Calvin.</hi> Sharp as they are, they were outwitted by the ſons of <hi>Rome:</hi> the religious of the ſeveral convents made a requeſt to the conqueror, that they might be permitted to quit their houſes in ſolemn proceſſion; each carried a large waxen taper in his hand, within which were concealed their diamonds, and all the leſſer treaſures. The vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were defrauded of the fruits of their valor, and, as <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat</hi> ſays, their commander loſt his head, on his return to <hi>Holland,</hi> for not having ſagacity enough to diſcover the trick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malacca</hi> is exceedingly large; much of it is built of ſtrong bamboo, but the ſeveral ſtone buildings, among them the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's houſe, make a conſpicuous figure. A narrow but deep and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0792500103:44"/>rapid river divides the town from the fort, one ſide of which is waſhed by the ſea; in that part only four leagues diſtant from the low land of <hi>Sumatra. Malacca</hi> is a true emporium, or mart, the great magazine of the various rich articles of commerce brought from the ſeveral countries I have mentioned. As to the peninſula itſelf, it yields little more than the ſine tin and elephants' teeth. Let me conclude, that this place was celebrated among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients for its gold,

<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings, ch. x. verſe 22.</note>, this, or ſome other part of <hi>India,</hi> might have been the place from which <hi>Solomon</hi> drew his wealth, peacocks being found in plenty here, and unknown, at leaſt in thoſe days, in any part of <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſouth of <hi>Malacca</hi> is the ſmall kingdom of <hi>Johore;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">KINGDOM OF JOHORE.</note> we have ſcarce any acquaintance with it, and know little more of its hiſtory, than that it was governed by a brutal ſet of princes, and that in 1712 a rebellion aroſe, which ended in the expulſion of the royal family.</p>
               <p>THE ſouthern entrance into the ſtreights of <hi>Malacca</hi> is filled with a moſt numerous archipelago of ſmall iſles, even to the ſhores of <hi>Sumatra.</hi> The land from <hi>Tanjong Buro,</hi> in <hi>Johore,</hi> bends into a creſcent, likewiſe filled with iſles.

               <p>FOR the tracing the remainder of the coaſts on the continent, I ſhall no more conſult the opinion of my able guide, M. <hi>D'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> but follow that of a countryman, Mr. <hi>John Caverhill,</hi> who, in the lviith volume of the Philoſophical Tranſactions, has given a very able criticiſm on thoſe parts of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> which relate to theſe particular ſhores.</p>

Their laws, however, were apparently very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe which ſubſiſt among them at preſent.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>A CHIEF, who has the title of king or ſultan, iſſues his commands to his great vaſſals, who obey when they think proper; theſe have inferior vaſſals, who often act in the ſame manner with regard to them. A ſmall part of the nation live independent, under the title of <hi>Oramcai</hi> or noble, and ſell their ſervices to thoſe who pay them beſt; whilſt the body of the nation is compoſed of ſlaves, and live in perpetual ſervitude.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>WITH theſe laws the <hi>Malais</hi> are reſtleſs, fond of navigation,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0792500103:51"/>war, plunder, emigrations, colonies, deſperate enterpriſes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and gallantry. They talk inceſſantly of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and their bravery, whilſt they are univerſally conſidered, by thoſe with whom they have intercourſe, as the moſt treacherous, ferocious people on the face of the globe; and yet, which appeared to me extremely ſingular, they ſpeak the ſofteſt language of <hi>Aſia.</hi> That which the Count <hi>de Forbin</hi> has ſaid in his memoirs, of the ferocity of the <hi>Macaſſars,</hi> is exactly true, and is the reigning characteriſtic of the whole <hi>Malay</hi> nations; more attached to the abſurd laws of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended honor, than to thoſe of juſtice or humanity, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerve, that amongſt them, the ſtrong oppreſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the weak; their treaties of peace and friendſhip never ſubſiſting beyond that ſelf-intereſt which induced them to make them, they are almoſt always armed, and either at war amongſt themſelves, or employed in pillaging their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THIS ferocity, which the <hi>Malais</hi> qualify under the name of courage, is ſo well known to the <hi>European</hi> companies, who have ſettlements in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that they have univerſally agreed in prohibiting the captains of their ſhips, who may put into the <hi>Malay</hi> iſlands, from taking on board any ſeamen of that nation, except in the greateſt diſtreſs, and then, on no account to exceed two or three.</q>
               </p>

                  <q>IT is nothing uncommon for a handful of theſe horrid ſavages ſuddenly to embark, attack a veſſel by ſurpriſe, poignard in hand, maſſacre the people, and make themſelves maſters of her. <hi>Malay</hi> batteaus, with twenty-five or thirty

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE <hi>Malais</hi> who are not ſlaves go always armed, they would think themſelves diſgraced if they went abroad without their poignards, which they call <hi>Crit;</hi> the induſtry of this nation even ſurpaſſes itſelf, in the fabric of this deſtructive weapon.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>As their lives are a perpetual round of agitation and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, they could never endure the long flowing habits which prevail amongſt the other <hi>Aſiatics.</hi> The habits of the <hi>Malais</hi> are exactly adapted to their ſhapes, and loaded with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of buttons, which faſten them cloſe to their bodies in every part. I relate theſe ſeemingly trifling obſervations, in order to prove, that in climates the moſt oppoſite, the ſame laws produce ſimilar manners, cuſtoms, and prejudices; their effect is the ſame too with reſpect to agriculture.</q>

The country is covered with odoriferous woods, ſuch as the eagle or aloes wood, the ſandal, and the <hi>Caſſia Odorata,</hi> a ſpecies of cinnamon: you there breathe an air impregnated with the odors of innumerable flowers of the greateſt fragrance, of which there is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

                  <q>THE <hi>Malay</hi> iſlands produce various kinds of dying woods, particularly the <hi>Sapan,</hi> which is the ſame with the <hi>Brazil</hi> wood.

                  <hi>Malacca</hi> abounds with quadrupeds, eſpecially with tigers, and others of the moſt ſavage kind.

               <p>I NOW return to the coaſt.
<note place="margin">UPPER SIAM.</note> The kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences on this ſide near <hi>Sangora,</hi> exactly oppoſite to its limits on the bay of <hi>Bengal.</hi> The town ſtands on a large river, and has ſome commerce in tin, ivory, aloe-wood, and coarſe gold. <hi>Ligore,</hi> about twelve leagues to the north,
<note place="margin">LIGORE.</note> is a very commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial town, and its neighborhood produces abundance of tin and of elephants teeth. It is ſeated a few miles up the river, and built of bamboo, thatched with reeds; the pagodas have lofty ſteeples in form of pyramids. The <hi>Dutch</hi> have or had here a factory; their houſes ſtand a league within the mouth of the river, and are built with brick. The road for ſhipping is two leagues at ſea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0792500103:58"/>THE whole eaſtern ſide of <hi>Siam</hi> is low, ſteep, and rocky, but inland riſes into lofty mountains. Towards the bottom of the gulph the land approximates, and the contracted part is called the bay of <hi>Siam;</hi> its entrance is by the mounts of <hi>Penſels</hi> or <hi>Pentens,</hi> impending over the water on the weſtern ſhore, and the high cape <hi>Siam</hi> on the oppoſite. The laſt may be ſeen from the bar of <hi>Siam,</hi> or the <hi>Meinam</hi> river, twenty-two leagues diſtant.</p>
               <p>ABOUT four hundred and eight miles from <hi>Ligore</hi> (following the curvature of the gulph) at the very bottom of the bay of <hi>Siam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RIVER MEINAM.</note> is the mouth of the great river <hi>Meinam,</hi> the <hi>Serus</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> and the moſt conſequential in the kingdom. The road for ſhipping extends for the ſpace of three leagues, in which all ſorts of veſſels may ſafely ride; ſuch was the caſe when that learned traveller <hi>Koempfer</hi> viſited the place in 1690. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on both ſides the river is marſhy, compoſed of the mud brought down in the annual floods; this river, like the <hi>Ganges,</hi> being ſubject to periodical inundations. <hi>Koempfer</hi> informs us that the name <hi>Manam</hi> or <hi>Meinam,</hi> in the <hi>Siameſe</hi> language, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the mother of humidities, from its abundance of water, which ſo greatly fertilizes the country. It is deep, rapid, and broader than the <hi>Elbe;</hi> the upper part is rocky, violent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by cataracts; the lower, divided into ſeveral channels, paſſes through a very level country to the ſea. The banks of the river are covered with trees, animated by monkies; numbers of villages may be ſeen on both ſides; the houſes generally ſtand, I may ſay, upon ſtilts or lofty poſts, ſo that the water during the inundations may paſs without incommoding the occupiers. Near the city of <hi>Judia,</hi> many of the villages conſiſt of inhabited ſhips,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0792500103:59"/>or floating habitations; theſe occaſionally move from place to place when the waters are high; the inmates keep a ſort of fair, and diſpoſe of their various commodities.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Meinam</hi> riſes at a conſiderable diſtance to the north, in the very extremity of the kingdom, poſſibly far beyond, for its fountains ſeem never to have been traced, and the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts are very uncertain; its courſe, as far as we know, runs due north and ſouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juthia</hi> or <hi>Judia,</hi> the capital of <hi>Siam,</hi> is ſeated in about Lat.
<note place="margin">CITY OF JUTHIA.</note> 14° 30′, on a low iſland in the form of a man's foot. It is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a lofty brick wall. The ſtreets are ſtrait, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with canals, which paſs quite through from eaſt to weſt. As Mr. <hi>Caverhill</hi> very reaſonably fixes the <hi>Zaba</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> to have been in the bottom of the bay of <hi>Siam,</hi> I ſee no reaſon againſt ſuppoſing that it might have been either at <hi>Juthia,</hi> or at ſome place not remote from that port. Ships may enter into many of the canals, and diſcharge their cargo near the principal houſes. The greater part of the ſtreets are very mean, built with bamboo, covered with the leaves of palms. Thoſe of the <hi>Chineſe, Hindoos,</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> are of ſtone, but very low; the fineſt houſes in <hi>Koempfer</hi>'s time, were ſuch which had been inhabited by the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>French.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">HISTORY OF PHAULKON.</note> The palace of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> miniſter of ſtate in the laſt century, makes the moſt conſpicuous figure; <hi>Phaulkon</hi> was a <hi>Grecian</hi> by birth, and ſeaman by profeſſion; he had ſerved various nations, but chiefly the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> In their ſervice, in capacity of a cockſwain, he came to <hi>Siam,</hi> and obtained an employment at court. He was a man of very fine natural abilities; and by his good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0792500103:60"/>and his ſucceſs in the management of affairs, roſe to the higheſt dignities, and became prime miniſter to the reigning prince.</p>
               <p>HIS ambition proved his ruin, and brought him to a violent death by the hands of the executioner. He became ſo intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icated with power, as to entertain a deſign upon the throne, to depoſe his royal maſter, and to place over the <hi>Siameſe, Monpi Totfo,</hi> ſon-in-law to the monarch, a phantom of a king, who was to be dependent on his will, and to be depoſed as ſoon as affairs came to a criſis. The king was at that time extremely ill of a dropſy; on his deceaſe, the whole royal lineage was to be put to death, and <hi>Phaulkon</hi> uſurp the power.</p>
               <p>IN order to accompliſh his deſigns, it was neceſſary to call in foreign aid; he perſuaded his weak maſter to ſend an embaſſy to <hi>Louis</hi> XIV. to requeſt his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to ſend perſons qualified to inſtruct in the arts his unpoliſhed ſubjects, ſo that he might ſhine pre-eminent among the Eaſtern nations. The firſt, who ſet out in 1680, were ſhipwrecked; the ſecond arrived ſafe in 1686. The vanity of <hi>Louis</hi> made him receive with every mark of reſpect theſe groteſque legates; the memory of their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is preſerved in a medal
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtoire de Medailles, tab. ccxvi.</note>. The king is repreſented ſeated on his throne; the embaſſadors making their obeiſance; above his majeſty is inſcribed <hi>Fama virtutis,</hi> intimating that the fame of his high qualities had induced them to come from this diſtant country. <hi>Louis,</hi> in compliance with the wiſh of the embaſſy, ſent Jeſuits, artiſts, and military officers; <hi>General de Fargues</hi> landed with ſeveral hundred ſoldiers, and was put into poſſeſſion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0792500103:61"/>of <hi>Bankok,</hi> the key of the kingdom, ſeated on the river, between the capital and the ſea. Juſt as every thing was ready for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, in May 1689, the plot was diſcovered; <hi>Monpi</hi> was ſeized by the king's ſon, and his head caſt at <hi>Phaulkon</hi>'s feet. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, thus hurled from his greatneſs, was tortured and almoſt ſtarved to death, then carried out of town, and beheaded; his body cut in two, and covered with a little earth, was ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the dogs; a ſad proof how <hi>Ambitio male ſuada ruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> is divided from north to ſouth by a long range of lofty mountains. On the weſt ſide,
<note place="margin">ACCOUNT OF SIAM.</note> or next to the bay of <hi>Bengal,</hi> the country is viſited by continual rains during the time the <hi>Monſoons</hi> blow from that quarter. On the eaſtern ſide no ſuch deluges are known, nor any floods but what are the effects of the moderate inundations of the <hi>Meinam,</hi> which fertilize the country beyond deſcription.
<note place="margin">FERTILITY.</note> The uſeful grain rice is produced in amazing crops, and every delicate fruit of the <hi>Indies</hi> without cultivation. <hi>Raynal</hi> mentions among the productions of <hi>Siam,</hi> log-wood like that cut in <hi>Campeachy.</hi> It is a terreſtrial paradiſe, but loſes all its advantages by groaning under the moſt deſpotic government on earth. The monarch rules within his ſeraglio, and his grandees are let looſe to oppreſs the wretched common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, according to their caprice and unreſtrained will. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions thus governed, ſtretch near a thouſand miles from north to ſouth, or from Lat. 20° 35′ to Lat. 7° 0′, and in the broadeſt part extend three hundred and ſixty.</p>
               <p>THE religion of the country is the ſame with that inculcated by the <hi>Bramins;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RELIGION.</note> but the <hi>Bramins</hi> of <hi>Siam</hi> are not a peculiar race, like thoſe of <hi>Hindooſtan;</hi> here every one who chuſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0792500103:62"/>the prieſthood; they uſually lead a monaſtic life, and have their convents; thoſe of each province are governed by a ſort of biſhop. Nuns or female monaſtics are frequent. The pagodas are of various forms, ſome have a great reſemblance to the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> architecture. The idols are monſtrous in their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>THE firſt knowledge of the Chriſtian religion was received by the miſſion of Jeſuits,
<note place="margin">MISSIONARIES.</note> led here under the conduct of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> ſome time before the year 1658, when pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. ſent over a reinforcement of religious men, but theſe being of other orders, were treated by the Jeſuits with the utmoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, nor would they condeſcend to permit them to ſhare in their labors, which had been attended with prodigious ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. As to the meſſage <hi>Louis</hi> XIV. ſent by his embaſſador Mr. <hi>Chaumont,</hi> in 1684, modeſtly requeſting his <hi>Siameſe</hi> Majeſty to become a good Catholic; he received this very proper reply,
<q>that he left it to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to judge, whether a change of a religion that had been followed in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, without interruption, during two thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty-nine years, could be a matter of ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to him, or a demand with which it was eaſy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and a matter which related entirely to <hi>God</hi> and not to him.</q> This well might check the zeal of the miſſionaries; but in the next reign, on the diſcovery of the treachery of the <hi>French</hi> general, and the murder of <hi>Phaulkon,</hi> the whole troop of the religious were ſent away, and all hopes of return entirely overthrown.</p>
               <p>IN many reſpects the <hi>Siameſe</hi> have an agreement with the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0792500103:63"/>
                  <hi>Chineſe;</hi> we muſt except their bodies, which are ſmall. In their head-dreſs they agree in the pointed bonnet, in the frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting of ſhips and boats, and now and then in their orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented architecture. The faces of the inhabitants are large,
<note place="margin">FORM OF THE SIAMESE.</note> their cheek bones prominent, their foreheads and chins contract equally to a point; their cheeks hollow, their eyes ſmall and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, noſe ſhort and rounded; their ears long, by artificial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion; their complexions ſwarthy; their hair black and coarſe, and would be extremely long, but that it is cut ſo very cloſe that their heads ſeem beſet with briſtles; their teeth black from art.</p>
               <p>IT is to be lamented, that ſo well informed a traveller as <hi>Koemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> ſhould not have left us any thing on the ſubject of the natural hiſtory of ſo fertile a kingdom; we have nothing to ſay of its vegetable productions, and as to its animals, we can only inform our readers that it ſwarms with elephants,
<note place="margin">ELEPHANTS.</note> and that their teeth are a conſiderable article of commerce. In this tyrannous go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they are quite a peſt; theſe, and other herbivorous beaſts, deſtroy the labors of the huſbandmen, and none dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the attacks of thoſe ravagers. Elephants are here only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for ſtate; the king keeps great numbers, and often makes them the inſtrument of his cruelty. They are the executioners of his wrath on his offending ſubjects, and are inſtructed how to put them to various kinds of death, either by trampling them under their broad feet, or deliberately tearing their limbs off with their lithe proboſcis, or flinging them up into the air, and catching them empaled on their great tuſks.</p>
               <p>BUFFALOES and deer are found here in vaſt numbers;
<note place="margin">DEER.</note> their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0792500103:64"/>ſkins conſtitute a great article of commerce; fifty thouſand of them have annually been ſent to <hi>Japan</hi> through the medium of the <hi>Dutch. Mandelſlo,</hi> a moſt intelligent traveller, gives the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account of the trade of <hi>Siam,</hi> as it was in the year 1639; ſpeaking of the city of <hi>Juthia,</hi> he ſays,
<q>the principal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce conſiſts in ſtuffs brought from <hi>Suratta</hi> and the coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> all ſorts of <hi>Chineſe</hi> commodities, precious ſtones, gold, benjamin, wax, copper, lead, indico, calamba-wood, brazil-wood, ſapphires, rubies, &amp;c. but above all deer ſkins, whereof they furniſh the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> with about fifty thouſand every year. It likewiſe yields a great trade of rice, which they tranſport to all the neighboring iſles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>TO this we may add the more modern account of the rich productions of this kingdom,
<note place="margin">OTHER PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DUCTIONS.</note> taken from Mr. <hi>Dalrymple</hi>'s Reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 118.</note>.
<q>The productions of this country are prodigious quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of grain, cotton, benjamin, ſandal, agualo, and ſapan woods; antimony, tin, lead, iron, load-ſtones, gold and ſilver, ſapphires, emeralds, agates, cryſtal, marble, and tambanck.</q>
               </p>
               <p>HOGS and wild ſwine ſwarm in the dominions of <hi>Siam;</hi> moſt of the ſavage beaſts of <hi>India</hi> are equally numerous in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Koempfer</hi> ſpeaks of two ſpecies of monkies, one very large, and black, the other ſmaller, and of a grey color. The firſt ſeems a kind not well aſcertained, for the only black monkey of the old world we are acquainted with, is that deſcribed by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> tab. 311, which is no larger than a cat.</p>
               <p>AFTER doubling cape <hi>Liant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RIVER OF LIANT.</note> a bay opens to the north, and at the bottom receives the river of <hi>Liant.</hi> A vaſt chain of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0792500103:65"/>which run from north to ſouth, and unite with thoſe of <hi>China</hi> in Lat. 22° 0′, divide the kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi> from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Laos</hi> and <hi>Cambodia,</hi> and almoſt reach the ſea near the river of <hi>Liant.</hi> The upper part of this tract is in <hi>Laos,</hi> the more ſouthern forms the kingdom of <hi>Cambodia,</hi> which is compared to a vaſt valley, bounded by the <hi>Siameſe</hi> chain to the weſt, and that of <hi>Cochin-China</hi> to the eaſt. The coaſt takes a ſouth-eaſtern di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the bay of <hi>Liant</hi> as far as cape <hi>Cambodia,</hi> a ſpace of three hundred miles, ſkirted by numbers of ſmall iſles waſhed by the bay of <hi>Siam.</hi> From the point of <hi>Liant</hi> is a ſandy barren deſert, reaching, according to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> as far as <hi>Ponteamas,</hi> above two-thirds of the coaſt.</p>
               <p>THIS extenſive tract has great ſcarcity of ports;
<note place="margin">PONTEAMAS.</note> the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed is that of <hi>Ponteamas,</hi> in Lat. 10° 45′. M. <hi>Le Poivre</hi> gives ſo enchanting a picture of this colony, that I will no more riſque injuring it by the abridgment, than I did his hiſtory of the <hi>Malayes.</hi> His deſcriptions are ſo exquiſite, that I muſt hope that they will not fall under a too frequent imputation on the writers of his lively nation, of being <hi>plus beau que la verité.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Departing, ſays M. <hi>Le Poivre,</hi> from the peninſula of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca,</hi> and the iſlands of the <hi>Malais,</hi> towards the north, I fell in with a ſmall territory called <hi>Cancar,</hi> but known on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime charts under the name of <hi>Ponthiamas.</hi> Surrounded by the kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> where deſpotiſm and depopulation go hand in hand; the dominions of <hi>Camboya,</hi> where no idea of eſtabliſhed government ſubſiſts; and the territories of the <hi>Malais,</hi> whoſe genius, perpetually agitated by their feudal laws, can endure peace neither at home nor abroad; this charming
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0792500103:66"/>country, about fifty years ago, was uncultivated and almoſt deſtitute of inhabitants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>A <hi>Chineſe</hi> merchant, commander of a veſſel which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in commerce, frequented theſe coaſts; being a man of that intelligent reflective genius, which ſo characteriſtically marks his nation, he could not, without pain, behold immenſe tracts of ground condemned to ſterility, though naturally more fertile than thoſe which formed the riches of his own country; he formed, therefore, a plan for their improvement: with this view, having firſt of all hired a number of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers, ſome <hi>Chineſe,</hi> others from the neighboring nations, he, with great addreſs, inſinuated himſelf into the favor of the moſt powerful princes, who, for a certain ſubſidy, aſſigned him a guard for his protection.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>IN the courſe of his voyage to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and the <hi>Philippine</hi> iſlands, he borrowed from the <hi>Europeans</hi> their moſt uſeful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and improvements, particularly the art of fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defence; with regard to internal police, he gave the preference to the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> The profits of his commerce ſoon enabled him to raiſe ramparts, ſink ditches, and provide ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; theſe preliminary precautions ſecured him from a <hi>coup de main,</hi> and protected him from the enterprizes of the ſurrounding nations of barbarians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>HE diſtributed the lands to his laborers, without the leaſt reſervation of any of thoſe duties or taxes known by the names of ſervice, or fines of alienation; duties which, by allowing no real property, become the moſt fatal ſcourge to agriculture, and is an idea which revolts againſt the common ſenſe of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0792500103:67"/>every wiſe nation. He provided his coloniſts at the ſame time with all ſorts of inſtruments proper for the labor and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their grounds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>IN forming a laboring, and commercial people, he thought that no laws ought to be framed, but thoſe which nature has eſtabliſhed for the human race in every climate; he made theſe laws reſpected by obeying them firſt himſelf, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting an example of ſimplicity, induſtry, frugality, humanity, and good faith: he formed, then, no ſyſtem of laws—he did more—he eſtabliſhed morals.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>HIS territories ſoon became the country of every induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man who wiſhed to ſettle there; his port was open to all nations. The woods were cleared, the grounds judiciouſly labored, and ſown with rice; canals cut from the rivers wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their fields; and plentiful harveſts, after ſupplying them with ſubſiſtence, furniſhed an object of extenſive commerce. His integrity, his moderation, and his humanity, made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. He never wiſhed to reign, but only to eſtabliſh the empire of reaſon; his ſon, who now fills his place, inherits his virtues as well as his poſſeſſions; by agriculture, and the commerce he carries on with the produce of his lands, he has become ſo powerful, that the barbarians, his neighbors, ſtile him king, a title which he deſpiſes: he pretends to no right of ſovereignty, but the nobleſt of all, that of doing good; happy in being the firſt laborer and the firſt merchant of his country, he merits, as well as his father, a title more glorious than that of king—the friend of mankind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE barbarians of the neighborhood, amazed to ſee abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0792500103:68"/>ſo ſuddenly ſucceed to ſterility, flocked for ſubſiſtence to the magazines of <hi>Ponthiamas;</hi> whoſe dominions, at this day, are conſidered as the moſt plentiful granary of that eaſtern part of <hi>Aſia;</hi> the <hi>Malais,</hi> the <hi>Cochin Chineſe,</hi> the <hi>Siameſe,</hi> whoſe countries are naturally ſo fertile, conſidering this little terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory as the moſt certain reſource againſt famine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>LET me here add, that our plain <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who viſited <hi>Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amas</hi> in 1720, found the town in ruins. It had been taken and plundered in the year 1717 by the <hi>Siameſe</hi> fleet, at which time it was a place of conſiderable trade. It may have recovered by the time M. <hi>Le Poivre</hi> was there, ſo as to vindicate his enthuſiaſtic account. The town is ſeated on a deep but narrow river, which in the ſeaſon of inundations communicates with that of <hi>Meinam Kom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CAMBODIA.</note> or <hi>Cambodia,</hi> and the city of the ſame name on its banks; by which means the commodities of the kingdom are ſent to this port, in preference to that at the mouth of the <hi>Cambodia,</hi> which is ſaid to be of very troubleſome navigation, by reaſon of the numbers of low iſlands and ſand banks which obſtruct the channel.</p>
               <p>IT is highly probable that ſuch was the ſtate of this river from the very early times; we find no antient port at this place, but learn from <hi>Ptolemy,</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0792500103:70"/>and offered to permit us to form factories and build forts to protect our trade. Mr. <hi>Bowyear</hi> (hereafter to be mentioned) ſays that the <hi>Cambodians</hi> reſemble the <hi>Malays,</hi> whoſe language is generally underſtood in all theſe parts.</p>
               <p>ABOUT two hundred <hi>Topaſſes</hi> or <hi>Indian Portugueſe,</hi> were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and married in the capital of <hi>Cambodia</hi> when <hi>Hamilton</hi> was there, and ſeemed the only remains of that people. They all have ſmall penſions from the king of the country; but in order to ſupport themſelves, are obliged to take to the chace of elephants, which they ſhoot, for the ſake of their teeth, with iron ſlugs, poiſoned by immerſion in the thick bark of a certain tree; the beaſt is ſure to fall in a ſhort time after receiving its wound. The ſame method is uſed in killing the buffaloes on account of their tongues.</p>

               <p>THE kingdom of <hi>Cambodia</hi> was known to the <hi>Arabs</hi> by the name of <hi>Rachmi.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RACHMI.</note> It was viſited in the ninth century by two <hi>Arabian</hi> travellers, who report that the fineſt muſlins in the world were made there, and that the natives wore garments ſo fine that they might be drawn through a middle ſized ring. The ſame writers ſpeak wonderful things of the <hi>Karkandan</hi> or unicorn, but from the whole deſcription, it is evident that they mean no other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal than our one-horned rinoceros.</p>
               <p>LET me conclude the account of the kingdom with ſaying,
<note place="margin">THE ANTIENT THINAE AND SINAE.</note> that the antients comprehended under the name of <hi>Thinae</hi> and <hi>Sinae,</hi> not only <hi>Cambodia,</hi> but alſo <hi>Pegu, Siam, Laos, Cochin-China,</hi> and the more ſouthern parts of <hi>China,</hi> of which <hi>Thina</hi> was the common capital.</p>
               <p>THE noted iſland of <hi>Pulo Condore</hi> lies about fifteen leagues to the ſouth of the weſtern channel of the <hi>Cambodia.</hi> It is ſituated in Lat. 8° 40′, its form is that of a creſcent; the length not above eight miles, the greateſt breadth about two; the whole is lofty and mountanous, and ſurrounded by leſſer iſles; the name is derived from <hi>Pulo,</hi> an iſle, and <hi>Condore</hi> a calabaſh, from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of that fruit. It is mentioned by a captain <hi>Saris,</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who ſailed by it in 1605 in his way from <hi>Japan.</hi> The harbor is between the greater iſland and a leſſer called the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0792500103:72"/>little <hi>Condore,</hi> lying off the north end, in which is ſufficient depth of water and ſafe anchorage. <hi>Dampier</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Voy. 288.</note> in 1686 careened and refitted his ſhip here, and has given us a good account of many particulars. He ſays that the ſoil is rich and black, the hills craggy, the eaſtern part of the iſland ſandy, but cloathed with trees of various kinds; ſome of the ſhores are rocky, others low and ſandy. All the iſlands are finely watered with ſmall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets during ten months of the year, which begin to fail towards the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> in the dry ſeaſon; but on digging, water may be found in many places.</p>

Theſe, poſſibly, were acquiſitions ſince the days of <hi>Dampier,</hi> and introduced by the <hi>French,</hi> who hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely and politically wiſhed to render theſe iſlands uſeful to navigators in their way to or from <hi>Japan, China, Manilla, Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin, Cochin-China,</hi> and many parts of <hi>India</hi> with which the <hi>Europeans</hi> have intercourſe. At the time Captain <hi>Gore</hi> viſited this iſland, a Mandarine from <hi>Saigore,</hi> came here with a certificate in <hi>French,</hi> from the biſhop of <hi>Adran,</hi> a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> certifying that he was ſent in order to give his aſſiſtance
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0792500103:73"/>to any <hi>European</hi> ſhip which might touch at this port. <hi>Dampier</hi> recommended the erection of a fort, and mentions, among other advantages, that ſhips might in this iſland be ſupplied with maſts and yards, poſſibly from the ſame tree which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the tar and pitch.</p>
               <p>THE animals, when <hi>Dampier</hi> reſided on the iſland,
<note place="margin">ANIMALS.</note> were only hogs, lizards, and <hi>guanoes.</hi> Before Captain <hi>Gore</hi> reached <hi>Pulo Condore,</hi> it was plentifully ſtocked with buffaloes, tranſported from the continent, which increaſe here very ſucceſsfully. Numbers of monkies inhabit the woods, and two ſpecies of ſquirrels, one of a beautiful ſhining black, the other of the kind called <hi>flying,</hi> ſtriped brown and white, and probably a new ſpecies. <hi>Gaubil</hi> alſo obſerved rats with pendulous ears. To the reptiles we add, that father <hi>Gaubil</hi> ſaw here, in 1722, the flying dragon, or <hi>Draco-volans;</hi> a ſcaly ſpecies of lizard called <hi>Koka,</hi> from its piercing note reſembling in ſound that word; it reſides in hollow trees; its bite is mortal. From theſe circumſtances I ſuſpect it to be the <hi>Gekko.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HERE are a variety of parrots, paroquets, and pigeons, and in the woods numbers of poultry, in a ſtate of nature. I refer the reader, for a further account, to page 262. vol. ii. of the Outlines of the Globe. The thruſh, called by Mr. <hi>Latham</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Dampier</hi> found on the ſhores great plenty of the green turtle;
<note place="margin">TORTOISES.</note> theſe he ſuppoſes to have been in a ſtate of migration, being of opinion, that for want of food it is impoſſible for them to ſtay the whole year in the neighboring ſeas. Our great navigator
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0792500103:74"/>found them here from the 13th of <hi>March</hi> to the 21ſt of <hi>April.</hi> The natives of this iſland took them in large nets, and boiled the fat for the ſake of the oil.</p>
               <p>THE inhabitants of <hi>Pulo Condore,</hi> ſuppoſed to be originally of <hi>Cochin-China,</hi> are ſmall in ſtature, of dark complexion, long viſaged, with black and lank hair, white teeth, thin lips, ſmall eyes, high noſes. Their religion is idolatrous; they worſhip chiefly the elephant and the horſe, ſimilar to the objects of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in <hi>Tonquin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN 1702 <hi>Allan Ketchpole,</hi>

At the end of the term he baſely refuſed to fulfil his contract. Thoſe iſlanders, remarkable for the fidelity with which they execute all their agreements, are as determined to revenge any injuries offered to them: in the night they put to death <hi>Ketchpole,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> a few, on the firſt alarm, eſcaped in a boat. The <hi>Macaſſars</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained their liberty, and inflicted a moſt juſtifiable puniſhment on their perſidious maſter.</p>
               <p>HERE <hi>Dampier</hi>'s crew was welcomed by the people coming on board, and offering the free uſe of their women during their ſtay.

                  <note place="margin">CIAMPA.</note> after a ſhort journey eaſtward, we reach the ſmall territory of <hi>Ciampa,</hi> or <hi>Bink Thoan,</hi> which extends about a hundred and fifty miles along the ſhore, the breadth does not exceed ninety.

<note place="margin">LOVES, A PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE.</note> their complexions tinged with red, their noſes ſomewhat flatted; their hair long and black; they have ſmall whiſkers, but ſcarcely any beards; their dreſs, a ſhirt and breeches of cotton, the laſt covered with a ſort of petticoat of white cloth, fringed with ſilk, according to the circumſtance of the wearer. They are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a monarch who reſides at <hi>Feneri,</hi> the capital of the country, in a mean palace, and with little ſtate; he is in fact a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the king of <hi>Cochin-China,</hi> who ſends a mandarine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide at the court as preſident of the council, and without his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice nothing of moment is done. The productions of the country are very few; ſome cotton, indigo, and bad ſilk, for which they traffick with the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> They are inferior to the <hi>Cochin-Chineſe</hi> in their military, but excel them in naval affairs.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0792500103:76"/>Their ſhips or jonks are tolerably well built; they are chiefly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in fiſheries, which are very conſiderable, and form their chief article of commerce. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> ſend ſhips very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the northern ports of the country laden with tea, an inferior ſort of ſilk, porcellane, and ſome other commodities of that empire.

               <p>AMIDST the mountains inhabit a race of people named <hi>Moyes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MOYES.</note> who go naked, excepting a cloth which is wrapped round their middle; they are employed in hard labor, and are little better than ſlaves. Both the <hi>Loyes</hi> and <hi>Moyes</hi> are regulated by the ſame laws; the government is very oppreſſive; they are puniſhed for the leaſt fault, and among the common people, that of ſhewing any appearance of wealth, is one of the firſt moment; the only good in the ſyſtem of government is the toleration of religion. Here is found a degenerated <hi>Mahometaniſm;</hi> the doctrine of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fucius;</hi> and idolatry, in all the variety and extravagancy of image worſhip. We know little of this country; I am obliged to M. <hi>Mannevillette</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 148.</note> for my information, which he got from the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>La Galathea,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> frigate which put into one of the ports of <hi>Ciamba</hi> in 1720, and was detained there for ſome time.</p>
               <p>IN 1695 Mr. <hi>Higginſon,</hi> preſident of <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> formed the idea of opening a trade with <hi>Ciampa,</hi> and ſent Mr. <hi>Bowyear</hi> on a ſort of embaſſy to the king of <hi>Cochin-China.</hi> At his court he met with the prince of this country, who gave him every encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,

               </p>
               <p>I MAY add here to my account of the river, that at the mouth is never leſs than four fathoms of water, and that it is navigable for ſhips of ſome burden up to the very capital, above which ſmall veſſels only are uſed, and the navigation is (by report) ſaid to be interrupted by a cataract.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to <hi>D'Anville,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">COCHIN-CHINA.</note> the kingdom of <hi>Cochin-China</hi> unites with its tributary <hi>Ciampa</hi> at the bay of <hi>Comorin;</hi> the original name is <hi>Anam.</hi> The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> beſtowed on it the appellation it bears at preſent, which, by the help of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> word <hi>Cochi,</hi> ſignifies the country weſt of <hi>China.</hi> In deſcribing the form of this extenſive ſtripe of empire, I ſhall include in it, its <hi>les Pais conquis.</hi> The whole, beginning from the borders of <hi>Cambodia,</hi> is in form of a bow, bending into the ocean as far as <hi>Cape Varelle,</hi> in Lat. 13° 0′, when it inclines to its northern extremity in Lat. 17° 30′. The whole length of this great curvature is about ſix hundred and ſixty miles, the breadth not exceeding that we have given to <hi>Ciampa.</hi> The northern borders are defended by a wall, which runs from the ſea to the great chain of mountains, and forbids all approach from that quarter, as the inacceſſible chain itſelf does every attempt of invaſion from their weſtern neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. The <hi>Moyes,</hi> who inhabit theſe mountains, are ſaid to be a moſt ſavage and ferocious race.</p>
               <p>THE court of <hi>Cochin-China</hi> is uſually held at <hi>Sinoa;</hi> a little to the ſouth of the wall there, ſays Mr. <hi>Bowyear,</hi> the king, in his <hi>Tongtan</hi> or eighth moon, takes his recreation with his Mandarines, and forbids all interruption by petitions or any ſort of buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0792500103:78"/>ALL the lower part of the kingdom has its annual inundations,
<note place="margin">INUNDATED.</note> like the other tropical countries, which give it prodigious ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Borri</hi>'s account of the peculiarity of the floods in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is very curious. The rains on the mountains during the wet ſeaſon are intermittent; they happen once a fortnight, and laſt three days at a time, bringing fertility and plenty to the ſubjacent country. This rain is called <hi>Lut;</hi> its arrival is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by every one, from the king to the peaſant, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt feſtivity. The overflowing of the <hi>Nile</hi> is not received in <hi>Egypt</hi> with greater rapture. The ſeaſons in <hi>Cochin-China</hi> may be called four. The violent heats laſt during <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> the rains fall in <hi>September, October,</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> and ab ae the violence of the ſun. In <hi>December, January,</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> the cold northern winds prevale, accompanied by cooling ſhowers. In <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> all the beauties of ſpring appear, and the fruits of every kind of vegetation bleſs the country.</p>
               <p>THE great harveſt is that of rice;
<note place="margin">RICE.</note> two ſpecies are cultivated on the mountanous and dry ſoils; one as white as ſnow, and when dreſſed, of a ſlimy viſcous nature, made into paſtes, ſuch as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micelli and the like. Both theſe kinds are exported to <hi>China</hi> in great quantities; the different ſorts of rice are the ſtaples of this country.</p>
               <p>THE ſugar-cane is another plant to which the <hi>Cochin-Chineſe</hi> pay the utmoſt attention,
<note place="margin">SUGAR.</note> and cultivate in vaſt abundance. They are acquainted with moſt of the proceſſes, and annually manufacture great quantities of both white and brown ſugars, ſo that their country ſupplies <hi>China</hi> with the principal part of this article, that vaſt empire not producing ſufficient for its own
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0792500103:79"/>conſumption. The city of <hi>Faifo</hi> or <hi>Foy Foe,</hi> is the <hi>emporium</hi> from which the <hi>Chineſe</hi> annually export about forty thouſand barrels, each weighing above two thouſand pounds. To the credit of theſe orientaliſts, all the cultivation, and all the poſterior proceſſes in the production of the ſugar, is the voluntary labor of freemen.</p>
               <p>To theſe articles of commerce may be added woods of different kinds, ſuch as aloes wood, or <hi>Agollocha,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">AGOLLOCHA.</note> erroneouſly called <hi>Eagle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Columba,</hi> and others of value, either in mechanics, or for their ſweet ſcent.
<note place="margin">COLUMBA WOODS.</note> The price of <hi>Columba</hi> wood on the very ſpot is five ducats a pound, at the ports ſixteen, and in <hi>Japan,</hi> to which much is exported, two hundred. A pillow of this wood is the higheſt luxury with the orientaliſts, particularly the <hi>Japaneſe,</hi> who will give three or four hundred ducats per pound for a piece big enough for that purpoſe.

               <p>COTTON is much cultivated, as is the mulberry tree,
<note place="margin">COTTON.</note> for the uſe of the ſilk-worms; great quantities of coarſe ſilks are made here, ſome ſo ſtrong as to ſerve for ſails and cordage, but the fineſt ſorts alſo are manufactured. The impoſing <hi>Chineſe</hi> export
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0792500103:80"/>from hence the fibres of a tree called <hi>Pitre,</hi> which they fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently mix with their own manufactures; they even import into their land of tea a courſe and black ſort; poſſibly for the ſake of enabling them to export their own, at greater profit, into our iſland. The mountains yield ſome gold, and much iron; the natives fuſe the laſt, and employ the metal in various manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories: raw and wrought ſilk may be added to the articles of commerce.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Portugueſe</hi> had once conſiderable influence in the court of <hi>Cochin-China;</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> made a ſtrong effort to come in for a ſhare of the commercial emoluments, but were expelled the kingdom by the ſuperior intereſt of their rivals.

The harbors are ſtill caſually frequented by <hi>European</hi> ſhips, but, I think, their imports inconſiderable.</p>
               <p>THE chief port is that of <hi>Foy Foe,</hi>

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0792500103:81"/>THIS country is certainly very favorable to trade and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having not fewer than ſixty ſafe harbors, and a great depth of water in every part.</p>

               <p>I BEG not to be underſtood to favor the doctrine of ſome ſyſtem-makers, by connecting the deſcription of the monkey of <hi>Cochin-China</hi> with that of the man.

               <p>THE government of <hi>Cochin-China</hi> is monarchical.
<note place="margin">GOVERNMENT OF COCHIN-CHINA.</note> It had once been a province to <hi>Tonquin,</hi> but was ſeparated from it in the beginning of the laſt century. The ſtory is differently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. I refer the reader to <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s account
<note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. ii. 211.</note> of the cauſe and manner: <hi>Le Poivre</hi> relates it differently; yet both may be right in the chief circumſtances of the event. The ruling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is that of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> not the pure and primaeval worſhip of the <hi>Shangti,</hi> the patriarchal religion; but that of <hi>China</hi> in its corrupted ſtate. Chriſtianity (introduced by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> during the time of their favor at the court of <hi>Cochin-China</hi>) got ground for ſome little time: miſſionaries were ſent, churches
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0792500103:86"/>erected, and multitudes of converts made. At length a king aroſe unfriendly to our doctrine, who expelled the miſſionaries, and compelled his ſubjects to return within the pale of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional church. Having premiſed this, I ſhall treat the reader with <hi>Le Poivre</hi>'s elegant account of the revolution, and the happy ſtate of this kingdom; but I muſt mix my fears with it, that as he hints at corruptions creeping faſt into the original ſyſtem of government, it may be found at preſent as abſolute, as tyrannical, and as abſurd as other eaſtern dominions, under the rule of the infirm individual. To begin,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> prince, unſucceſsful in a war he carried on againſt the king of <hi>Tonquin</hi> (under whom he enjoyed an office ſomewhat reſembling the <hi>Maires de palais</hi> under the <hi>Merovingian</hi> race of the kings of <hi>France</hi>) retired with his ſoldiers and adherents acroſs the river which divides that kingdom from <hi>Cochin-China.</hi> The ſavages, who then poſſeſſed this country, fled before theſe ſtrangers, and took refuge among the mountains of <hi>Tſiampa.</hi> After a long war with their old enemies, who purſued them, the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives remained at length peaceable poſſeſſors of the country known under the name of <hi>Cochin-China;</hi> it extends about two hundred leagues from north to ſouth, but narrow and unequal from eaſt to weſt. They then applied themſelves entirely to the cultivation of rice, which, being the ordinary food of the inhabitants of <hi>Aſia,</hi> is to them an object of the greateſt importance. They ſeparated into little cantonments, and eſtabliſhed themſelves on the plains, which extend along the banks of the rivers.</q>

                  <q>THE ſix firſt kings, founders of this monarchy, governed the nation as a father governs his family; they eſtabliſhed the laws of nature alone; they themſelves paid the firſt obedience to them. Chiefs of an immenſe family of laborers, they gave the firſt example of labor; they honored and encouraged agriculture, as the moſt uſeful and honorable employment of mankind. They required from their ſubjects only a ſmall annual free-gift to defray the expence of their defenſive war againſt their <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> enemies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>OFF the coaſt of <hi>Cochin-China</hi> are the <hi>Paracels,</hi>

There are men that will handle the tree, or touch the juice with impunity; while others will be viſited with all the deleterious ſymptoms by being in the way of the ſmoke, or even of the wind which carries the effluvia or exhalations of this ſingular tree.</p>
               <p>IT has been obſerved that the workers in <hi>Laquer</hi> or <hi>Japan,</hi> feel the bad effects, being ſubject to violent eruptions, in form of boils or blotches.

Before the mouth is a line of hard ſand two miles long; the entrance is diſtinguiſhed by a high ridgy mountain far up the country called the <hi>Elephant.</hi> About ſix leagues from the mouth of the river is the village of <hi>Domea,</hi> uſually conſiſting of a hundred houſes, yet on the arrival of the <hi>European</hi> ſhips it ſoon increaſes to a large town; the natives reſort for ſake of trade from all parts; houſes ſuddenly ſpring up; for being only conſtructed of frames of bamboo, and the roof of palm or other leaves, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary town is quickly formed, in which a fair is kept as long as the ſhips remain in the harbor.</p>
               <p>THE river is ſubject to the ſame periodical floods as others in the tropical regions; and the ſame fertility is the conſequence. The wet ſeaſon commences the latter end of <hi>April</hi> or beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and laſts till towards the cloſe of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The rains are intermittent; ſome are of two or three days continuance, others of only a few hours, with intervals of fine weather, eſpecially
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0792500103:92"/>towards the beginning and concluſion of the ſeaſon. During the wet months the heat is intolerable, eſpecially when the ſun can force its rays through the thick clouds.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Typhons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TYPHONS.</note> or as <hi>Dampier</hi> calls them <hi>Tuffoons,</hi> are moſt tremendous in this bay and on the coaſt of <hi>China.</hi> They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vale in the months of <hi>July, Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly near the change of the moon. They are preceded by very fine weather; a preſaging cloud appears in the north-eaſt, black near the horizon, edged with copper color, on the upper part fading into a glaring white. It often exhibits a ghaſtly appearance twelve hours before the <hi>Typhon</hi> burſts; its rage laſts many hours from the north-eaſt, attended with dreadful claps of thunder, large and frequent flaſhes of lightning, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive hard rains; then it ſinks into a dead clam; after which it begins again with redoubled rage from the ſouth-weſt, and continues an equal length of time.</p>
               <p>THE great <hi>Halley</hi> gives an account of the ſurpriſing tides in this bay;
<note place="margin">TIDES.</note> each flux is of twelve hours duration, and its re-flux the ſame, ſo that there occurs but one high water in twenty-four hours. The great Philoſopher ſhall ſpeak in his own words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>ON the firſt and ſecond days, at the water's increaſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes are very ſmall and uncertain, but afterwards the tides for thirteen days are conſtant in their courſe, one flood and one ebbing being completed in twenty-four hours time, equally ſharing the ſpace of a lunar circuition of the earth between them, and every flood beginning neareſt three quarters of an hour later than the precedent flood, and alſo conſiderably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in the height of the tide every day, from the third unto
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0792500103:93"/>the ſixth and ſeventh days of the water's age, on which two days the flood runs very high; but on the eighth day (which may be accounted the laſt of the ſpring tides) the waters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin gradually to decreaſe again, retaining the ſame orderly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of time in each tide, until the next following firſt day of the water's increaſe; when, during two days unſettledneſs, there is a ſhifting of the tides in reſpect of the beginning of the flood and ebb, after which ſaid ſhifting, a conſtancy in their inverted courſe is again retained in the above mentioned order for thirteen days following.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cachao,</hi> the principal city of <hi>Tonquin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CITY OF CACHAO.</note> lies about eighty miles higher up the river, and is the place where the chief trade is carried on. The imports are conveyed from the ſhips in large <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> boats, navigated by the natives. The tide runs with great rapidity thirty or forty miles above <hi>Domea,</hi> through a rich and beautiful plain; near <hi>Hean,</hi> a town of two thouſand houſes, is the place where the two channels meet, and form the <hi>Delta</hi> of <hi>Tonquin,</hi> about eighty miles from the ſea. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have a ſtreet to themſelves at <hi>Hean.</hi> For a time they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at <hi>Cachao,</hi> but became ſo numerous that they ſeemed to ſwallow up the very natives; the king therefore ordered them to remove here. The <hi>French</hi> alſo had a factory in this town in <hi>Dampier</hi>'s time. Is is from that honeſt voyager I take my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, having no later authority of any authenticity. The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> and <hi>Siameſe</hi> jonks come up as high as the town, and ride in the middle of the river.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cachao</hi> is a city of twenty thouſand houſes; the walls uſually made of mud and thatch, but ſome are of brick, covered with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0792500103:94"/>tiles. Here are three regal places; two very mean, the third more magnificent, but built of timber, and open at the ſides. This, with the courts, fiſh-ponds, and docks for the pleaſure boats, take up a vaſt ſpace of ground, ſurrounded by a wall faced with brick. There are ſeveral gates, and ſtairs to aſcend to the top of the walls, round which is a pleaſant walk. This place is the reſidence or rather priſon of the <hi>Boua,</hi> or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Tonquin.</hi> In this country is a moſt ſingular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by a revolution which happened long ago, the general of the reigning monarch made himſelf maſter of the empire; he aſſumed all the regal power, and ſeized the whole revenue, but did not venture to extirpate the royal family, for fear of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection the people entertained for their antient rulers. The executive power is lodged in the general or his heirs, who is called <hi>Choua;</hi> he is quite abſolute, has his guards, and all the inſignia of majeſty. The <hi>Boua</hi> is kept as a ſtate priſoner, with his wives and children, and diverts himſelf within the palace walls, for he is never allowed to ſtir out. The <hi>Choua</hi> pays him all external reſpects, viſits him three times a year, gives him the precedence, makes him a tender of his life and ſervices, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that all he does is in kindneſs, to ſave him the fatigues of government. The <hi>Choua</hi> places his own creatures about him, and no others are permitted to have acceſs.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have or had factories in this city.
<note place="margin">FACTORIES.</note> I am not well acquainted with the exports of the country; they are ſaid to be gold, woods for dying, raw and wrought ſilk, ſome callicoes, varniſh, turpentine, ſalt, earthen ware, anniſeed, and drugs of ſeveral kinds; pearls are alſo found on the coaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0792500103:95"/>THE royal navy is an affair of ſtate, uſeleſs and contemptible in wars; and as to ſhips of commerce, there are ſcarcely any; ſo that every thing is brought in and out of the kingdom in foreign bottoms.</p>
               <p>I MAY be pardoned for digreſſing to the healing art of the <hi>Tonquineſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TONQUIN MEDICINE.</note> I muſt produce their receipt for the cure of the bite of the mad dog, the gaol diſtemper, and other maladies incident to human nature; let the good intent apologize for the following extract, thought worthy of a place in the eleventh volume
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 1051.</note> of the Philoſophical Tranſactions.</p>
               <p>THEY <hi>(the Tonquineſe)</hi> take of the beſt muſk about gr. xvi. of the pureſt native cinnabar, and fineſt vermillion, each about gr. xxiv. and, having reduced them ſeparately to impalpable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, mix and adminiſter them in about a gill of arrack; which, in two or three hours, generally throws the patient into a ſound ſleep and perſpiration; if not, they repeat the doſe, and think the cure certain.</p>
               <p>THE religion of this country is the ſame with that of <hi>Cochin-China,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RELIGION.</note> but idolatry appears here with much leſs magnificence; the <hi>Pagodas</hi> are mean, and their images numerous. It ſhould ſeem that the <hi>Mandarines</hi> and better ſort of people are more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and confine themſelves to the worſhip of one GOD. They do not frequent the pagodas, they have no idols, but adore the ſupreme in their courts, with uplifted eyes. A perſon of the family reads the petition to heaven. <hi>Dampier</hi>'s
<note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. ii. 58.</note> account of the ceremony is curious; "When they make this petition," ſays he,
<q>they order a great deal of good meat to be dreſſed, and calling
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0792500103:96"/>all their ſervants into the court where the ceremony is to be performed, they place the food on a table, where alſo two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe-pots are placed, and then the mandarine preſents a paper to the clerk, who reads it with an audible voice. In the firſt place, there is drawn up an ample account of all that GOD has bleſt him withal, as health, riches, honor, favor of his prince, &amp;c. and long life, if he be old; and towards the concluſion, there is a petition to GOD for a continuance of all theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and a further augmentation of them; eſpecially with long life, and favor of his prince, which laſt they eſteem as the greateſt of all bleſſings. While this paper is reading, the maſter kneels down, and bows his face to the earth, and when the clerk has done reading it, he puts it to the burning ruſhes, that are in the incenſe-pot, where it is conſumed; then he flings in three or four little bundles of ſacred paper, which is very fine and gilded; and when that alſo is burnt, he bids his ſervants eat the meat.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is ſingular that in matters relative to their oaths of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<note place="margin">OATH.</note> a ſpecies of ſacrament is annually performed, at the ſeaſon in which the <hi>Mandarines</hi> receive from the great officers under them the oath of fidelity to the king; this is attended with the following ceremony: they cut the throat of a hen, and let the blood fall into a baſon of arrack; of which every man has a ſmall portion given him to drink, after he has publicly declared his loyalty and zeal to ſerve his prince; and this is eſteemed the moſt ſolemn tie by which any perſon can engage himſelf.</p>
               <p>THE Chriſtian religion made conſiderable progreſs in this kingdom about the year 1680,
<note place="margin">MISSIONARIES.</note> and ſome time after. Here were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0792500103:97"/>two biſhops, one ſtyled of <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> the other of <hi>Adran;</hi> but neither they nor the prieſts were ſuffered to come to <hi>Cachao,</hi> their reſidence being fixed at <hi>Hean;</hi> the proſelytes they made were among the meaneſt of the people, and it is ſuggeſted were gained over, more by the charitable donations of rice in times of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, than by any arguments of the pious miſſionaries. The prieſts were all maſters of ſome mechanic arts which were uſeful in this country, and which ſeem to have been the grounds of their toleration. By reaſon of ſome imprudence on their part, or ſome ſpirit of perſecution in the reigning powers, they were at length expelled; and four of the principal miſſionaries put to death by decapitation.</p>
               <p>I WILL conclude with the extent of the kingdom of <hi>Tonquin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">EXTENT.</note> and with a brief account of the inhabitants. It commences towards the ſouth at the <hi>Cochin-China</hi> wall, and is there very narrow; to the weſt it is bounded by the <hi>Cochin-Chineſe</hi> chain, which ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, and gradually leaves a larger and larger expanſe to the great plain of this kingdom. Theſe mountains keeping to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt unite with thoſe of <hi>China,</hi> and by their branches turning eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, conſtitute the boundaries between <hi>Tonquin,</hi> and the mighty empire of which the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> ſeem originally to have been a colony. The weſtern limit is at the river <hi>Gannan Kyan,</hi> in Lat. 21° 35′.</p>
               <p>THE province bordering on <hi>China</hi> on the ſide of the bay is that of <hi>Tenan,</hi> ſmall, but extremely fertile in rice; off the coaſt are multitudes of iſles, very properly called, by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Iſlands of Pirates.</hi> They are inhabited by fiſhermen, who make no ſcruple of robbing every ſhip they can maſter. Thoſe can
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0792500103:98"/>only be of the moſt defenceleſs kind, for theſe pirates have no other veſſels than the boats in which they carry on the fiſhing buſineſs, and thoſe unprovided with any ſort of fire-arms. From the extreme corruption of the government, there is no redreſs to be obtained againſt their exceſſes. An <hi>Engliſh</hi> captain has been fined for killing one of the crew of theſe petty thieves which had ſhewed a deſign of attacking his veſſel.</p>
               <p>IN one of the iſles the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> have a cuſtom-houſe, which is ſaid to bring in a million of rix-dollars.</p>
               <p>THE kingdom is very populous,
<note place="margin">NATIVES.</note> being thick ſet with villages. The natives generally are of a middle ſtature, of the tawny <hi>India</hi> color, but the faireſt and cleareſt of the kind; a bluſh or change of tint may be ſeen in ſome of them on any ſurpriſe of paſſion, imperceptible in any other <hi>Indians;</hi> their faces are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and oval, their noſes and lips of due proportions, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether agreeable; their hair black, long, and lank, very thick, and hanging down to their ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>THEIR teeth are (like thoſe of the <hi>Siameſe</hi>) as black as art can make them;
<note place="margin">BLACK TEETH.</note> the dying occupies three or four days, and is done to both boys and girls when they are about twelve or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old; during the whole operation they never take any nouriſhment, except of the liquid kind, for fear of being poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the pigment, if they ſwallowed what required maſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Every perſon, high and low, rich and poor, is obliged to undergo this ſevere operation, alledging it would be a diſgrace to human nature to have teeth white as thoſe of dogs or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, to which they compare thoſe who labor under that misfortune.</p>

The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> had ſpread themſelves to many of the kingdoms we have paſſed over, and the likeneſs is retained in proportion as they kept diſtinct, or mixed with the natives, ſo as to occaſion a devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from their native features and national cuſtoms. We fall in with the general arrangement of geographers, and leave the artificial diſtinctions which ſeparate them from that great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire whence they originated.

               <p>THE miracle of governments!
<note place="margin">GOVERNMENT.</note> Its dominion extends from the ſtreights of <hi>Hainan,</hi> in north Lat. 20° 13′, to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the province of <hi>Pe-che-li,</hi> in Lat. 41° 15′, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpace of near fifteen hundred miles in length, and in breadth above a thouſand. The numbers of its inhabitants (given by the lively <hi>Voltaire</hi>) are a hundred and fifty millions
<note n="*" place="bottom">The more accurate information obtained by Lord Macartney's embaſſy, makes the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>China</hi> Proper amount to 333,000,000, inhabiting a ſpace of 1,297,999 ſquare miles. E.</note>, yet all are ruled by a ſingle man! The government is founded on the law of the <hi>fifth commandment,</hi> and the honor paid to the emperor in the character of father, amounts to a veneration due to the Divinity himſelf. The greateſt of his ſubjects never ſpeak to him without kneeling; his words are law, and every thing he ſays is received as oracular. The ſame reſpect, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diminiſhed, is rendered to all his ſervants, as emanations of his ſacred perſon, from the firſt mandarine down to the loweſt officer who is inveſted with delegated power. He is called <hi>Tyen-tſe,</hi> the ſon of Heaven; <hi>Thau-ting,</hi> palace royal; <hi>Van-ſwi,</hi> ten thouſand years; and by other epithets emblematic of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0792500103:102"/>ſanctity of his perſon. All this reſults primarily from the ſenſe of filial duties, early imprinted on the hearts of his ſubjects as the firſt and greateſt point of religion, and objects of the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the magiſtrate. If a ſon is incorrigible by a parent, the parent takes him before the judge, who ſeldom fails to bring him to a ſenſe of his duty. Filial reſpect, ſays <hi>Confucius,</hi> in his <hi>Auking,</hi> a book on that very ſubject, is the foundation of all virtue, and of the wiſe government of the empire.</p>
               <p>CHILDREN are treated by the parents with the utmoſt rigor; the doctrine of obedience is inculcated with the greateſt ſeverity, ſo that it becomes ever after habitual: but as this reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ſuperiors is attended with fear and meanneſs, ſo deceit and fraud become the characteriſtics of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> nation.</p>
               <p>THE ſame reſpect to thoſe in a higher ſtation pervades all ranks of people; hence the <hi>Chineſe</hi> are the moſt ceremonious of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the very loweſt orders full of the moſt profound arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial civility.</p>
               <p>THE emperor has the diſpoſal of all offices, nay, even of the lives and fortunes of every ſubject. Nothing is done, of any moment, from one extremity to the other of this vaſt empire, without his knowledge; in criminal caſes the calendar of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners convict are laid before him, with a ſtatement of their crimes; theſe liſts are returned to the reſpective judges, with the ſentence affixed to each name, be it of death or free pardon. The leſſer puniſhments are left to the pleaſure of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</p>
               <p>THE deſpotiſm of the emperor is founded upon law and cuſtom;
<note place="margin">DESPOTIC.</note> not expreſſed, yet fully implied, it ſeems admitted that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0792500103:103"/>he can do no wrong! but it is on the principle that the ſtate is a vaſt family, that <hi>Tyen, i. e.</hi> the Supreme Being, hath placed him on the throne, in order that he may be a father and a mother to his people. In conſequence of this, a ſtrong ſenſe of his duty is continually before his eyes. The mandarines and princes of the blood are at liberty to remind him of any faults he may fall into; and even the people, if they find him negligent, are as ready to become tumultuous as in any other country. The grand ſecret of government in the emperor is the unremitting attention paid to the conduct of the mandarines and other magiſtrates, who are carefully watched, and moſt ſeverely puniſhed on every failure of duty. He himſelf is perpetually anxious to conſult the good of his ſubjects, and to avoid incurring their hatred or contempt.</p>
               <p>THERE is no country in which the filial duties are carried to ſuch a length.
<note place="margin">FILIAL DUTIES.</note> "A veneration for fathers," ſays <hi>Monteſquieu</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Spirit of Laws, vol. i. p. 433.</note>,
<q>was neceſſarily connected with a ſuitable reſpect for all who repreſented fathers, ſuch as old men, maſters, magiſtrates, and the emperor. This reſpect for fathers, ſuppoſed a return of love towards children, and conſequently the ſame return from old men to the young, from magiſtrates to thoſe who were under their juriſdiction, and from the emperor to his ſubjects. This formed the rites, and theſe rites the general ſpirit of the nation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A PARRICIDE is extremely rare in this empire: whenever it happens, the whole province is in alarm; the relations are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the mandarines depoſed, as it is preſumed it muſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0792500103:104"/>have been through their neglect of admonition on the firſt appearance of filial miſconduct, that ſuch a monſter could be found. The emperor himſelf is judge, and the crime is expiated by the ſentence of the criminal being cut into ten thouſand pieces.</p>
               <p>THE reigning vice of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> is ſelf-intereſt,
<note place="margin">SELF-INTEREST.</note> which gives riſe to the infinite variety of frauds of which they are juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. Lord <hi>Anſon</hi>'s account of them is by no means exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated. Attempts have been made to clear them from the aſperſion, but all has proved a vain labor. They conſider the art of over-reaching as a mark of ſuperior genius, and laugh at their dupe for ſuffering himſelf to be impoſed on. <hi>Du Halde</hi> tells a pleaſant ſtory of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> captain who had bargained with a <hi>Chineſe</hi> merchant for ſeveral bales of ſilk. On opening the firſt, he found it excellent; but all the reſt were quite rotten. The captain reproached the merchant in the moſt ſevere terms. The <hi>Chineſe,</hi> with great coolneſs, anſwered,
<q>Blame, Sir, your rogue of an interpreter, for he aſſured me, that you never would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the bales.</q>
               </p>
               <p>PRIDE and ſelf-conceit are the other characteriſtic faults of this people.
<note place="margin">PRIDE.</note> They aſſume an imaginary pre-eminence over all the world, and conceive nothing can be right but what they do. Their arts and their inventions have been brought to a certain point, at which they muſt ever ſtop, till they can prevale on themſelves to lower their high opinion of ſuperiority, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove upon the models brought from <hi>Europe.</hi> They can copy, but they do it with reluctance, as they look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the firſt of men. A good effect ariſes out of this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0792500103:105"/>foible, it repreſſes luxury; they think themſelves wiſer than the reſt of mankind, and that they are ſupplied with whatever their ſituation can require. Their rule of government, their cuſtoms, their arts, their habits, have remained for centuries the ſame, and probably will continue ſo to the end of time.</p>
               <p>THIS leading feature is, beſides,
<note place="margin">ANTIQUITY.</note> the reſult of the high and juſt opinion they entertain of the antiquity of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> nation, in compariſon of that of the reſt of the world; and they with truth obſerve, that they were a poliſhed people ages before the nations of modern <hi>Europe</hi> had emerged from ſavage manners and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ignorance.</p>
               <p>THE founder of their empire is ſaid to be <hi>Fo-hi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">FO-HI, FOUNDER OF THE EMPIRE.</note> cotemporary with <hi>Phaleg</hi> and <hi>Heber.</hi> His ſubjects at that time were nearly in the ſtate of nature; they fed on what they caught, ate it raw, drank the blood, and clothed themſelves with the ſkins. He taught them to make fiſhing-nets and ſnares for birds, to rear domeſtic animals, and inſtructed them in various arts of life; and to ſoften the fierceneſs of his people, invented muſic, and the inſtrument <hi>Kin. China</hi> was inhabited above two thouſand years before the Chriſtian aera, demonſtrable from an eclipſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at that period. The boaſt of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> is, that their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy has continued four thouſand years under the government of emperors; that it experienced twenty-two dynaſties or revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, but the commotions each occaſioned were ſo ſhort that the country ſuffered very little inconveniency, and returned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into its former regular ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>THE original religion of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> was truly pure,
<note place="margin">RELIGION.</note> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably delivered to them by the firſt founder of the empire,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0792500103:106"/>
                  <hi>Fo-hi,</hi> as derived from the patriarchs, amongſt whom that illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious character may nearly be ranked. The firſt who reached <hi>China</hi> brought with them the religion of <hi>Noah.</hi> They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged one great and ſupreme Being, and profeſſed to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his laws engraven on their hearts. They juſtly made that Being the model of perfection, poſſeſſed of omnipotence, omniſcience, providence, goodneſs, juſtice, and mercy. They admit the doctrine of grace, for they ſay that the moſt wicked man, if he makes uſe of the aſſiſtance offered to him by <hi>Tyen,</hi> or the Supreme Being, may attain the higheſt virtues. They hold alſo an expiation of ſins by their own ſacrifices; but confeſs that no external adoration will be accepted unleſs it is attended with inward ſentiments, and comes directly from the heart. I cannot, in my contracted plan, give all the detail of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the proofs of its origin from the patriarchs. I will only ſay, that, like them, they had their <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> Their <hi>five vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes</hi> correſpondent with the <hi>Moſaical</hi> hiſtory are eſteemed by them the ſource of all ſcience and morality.</p>
               <p>The great reformer of the religion of <hi>China</hi> was <hi>Conſucius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CONFUCIUS.</note> cotemporary with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and born 551 years before Chriſt; he purged it from all corruptions, and brought it to the perfection we have deſcribed; it ſtill continues the religion of the emperor and of the good and learned throughout his vaſt dominions.</p>
               <p>ABOUT ſix hundred years before the Chriſtian aera,
<note place="margin">SECT OF TAUT-SE.</note> aroſe the ſect of <hi>Taut-ſe,</hi> founded by <hi>Lau-kyun,</hi> who confined the felicity of this life to voluptuouſneſs; and taught that the ſoul died with the body; yet at the ſame time admitted the exiſtence of a Divine Being, which makes ſome people believe, that his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0792500103:107"/>had been corrupted by certain of his profligate diſciples, who might think it better to periſh than burn; yet as they muſt neceſſarily be perpetually diſturbed with the thoughts of death, they pretended to have invented a liquor of immortality, which, with the credulity of ſome of the emperors, gave a prodigious increaſe to their followers; they were greatly addicted to magic, introduced worſhip of ſpirits, ſacrificed to devils, and deluded the vulgar by a thouſand juggling tricks.</p>
               <p>THE laſt was the ſect of <hi>Fo</hi> or <hi>Fwe</hi> (not to be confounded with the great <hi>Fo-hi.</hi>)
<note place="margin">SECT OF FO.</note> Their doctrine was tranſported out of <hi>India</hi> about 65 years after the birth of Chriſt. An emperor dreamed of a ſaying of <hi>Confucius,</hi> that the <hi>Holy-one</hi> was to be found in the Weſt. He ſent ambaſſadors to <hi>India,</hi> who brought back the monſtrous image <hi>Fo,</hi> and all the extravagances of the <hi>Hindoo</hi> mythology. Temples or pagodas were erected in all places, and thoſe filled with the moſt monſtrous idols. They were attended by <hi>Bonzees</hi> innumerable. This is the religion of the vulgar, but not always confined to them; the emperors have at times been infected with it, deceived by the ſeeming auſterities practiſed by the <hi>Bonzees,</hi> and their ſenſeleſs penances, ſimilar to thoſe of ſome of the <hi>Indian Faquirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Chriſtian religion was introduced here as early as the year 636, when, to the aſtoniſhment of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CHRISTIANITY.</note> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared among them a ſet of men with fair hair and blue eyes, and of an air, form, and habit quite unknown. Theſe proved to be certain biſhops, prieſts, and deacons ſent out of <hi>Judea</hi> to propagate the goſpel in theſe diſtant parts. They were <hi>Syrians</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0792500103:108"/>and <hi>Neſtorians.</hi> At that time <hi>Jeſuiabas,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſheim</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. ii. p. 1.</note>, was at the head of that ſect. The memory of this tranſaction was quite loſt for ages, till in the year 1625 a monument was found in digging under ground near <hi>Si-ngan-ſu,</hi> in the province <hi>Shenſi.</hi> It was a table of marble, ten feet long and five broad, containing the names of the miſſionaries, and a hiſtory of the cauſe of their coming, written in the <hi>Syriac</hi> language, which was tranſlated by the Jeſuits who happened to be in <hi>China</hi> at the time of its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and is given in <hi>Kircher</hi>'s <hi>China Illuſtrata.</hi> There is no doubt of the authenticity. The Jeſuits are charged with a moſt uſeleſs and unavaling forgery, eſpecially by <hi>Voltaire.</hi> The curious may ſee more of the affair in <hi>Renaudot</hi>'s account of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>China</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Tranſ. Pt. ii. p. 76 et ſeq.</note>. The effect of this miſſion did not continue long; at firſt they made abundance of proſelytes; they were favored by the reigning emperor, permitted to build churches, and inculcate their doctrine among his ſubjects. This monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brings down their hiſtory to 783, the time of its being made. In the year 845, an emperor inimical to the monaſtic life aroſe, and by an ordinance entirely ſuppreſſed every religious houſe. This was in fact levelled at the <hi>Bonzees,</hi> and the profeſſors of the idolatry of <hi>Fo</hi> or <hi>Fwe,</hi> who had not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended vaſt ſums in the ornaments of their pagodas and monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
<note place="margin">CONVENTS.</note> but made them ſanctuaries for all kinds of profligates. This event correſponds exactly with our celebrated diſſolution: here four thouſand ſix hundred of the great monaſteries of male and female recluſes, and forty thouſand of the leſſer, were directed to be demoliſhed, the lands and revenues to revert to the royal
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0792500103:109"/>domain, and a hundred and fifty thouſand ſlaves belonging to the houſes to be ſet at liberty, enrolled and ranked among the people. As to theſe Chriſtians, who in the ordinance are called outlandiſh <hi>Bonzees</hi> from <hi>Ta-tſing</hi> or <hi>Mu-hu-pa,</hi> about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in number, they were alſo included, and directed to return to a ſecular life, "to the end that the cuſtoms of our empire," ſays the decree, "may be uniform and unmixed." From this time the hiſtory of theſe people was conſigned to oblivion, nor ever would have been known, but for the diſcovery of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnan-ſu</hi> monument.</p>
               <p>THE ambition of the great Jeſuit St.
<note place="margin">ST. FRANCIS DE XAVIER.</note> 
                  <hi>Francis de Xavier</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the power and importance of his new order, is mentioned largely at vol. i. p. 113. of this work.</p>
               <p>IN 1549 he ſailed from <hi>Goa</hi> to <hi>Japan,</hi> and after diſcharging his miſſion in that iſland, determined on a viſit to <hi>China.</hi> Death fruſtrated his pious deſign, but preſerved him from the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of being refuſed an entrance into the empire, according to the moſt rigid ordinances then in force. He departed this life off the iſle of <hi>Sancian.</hi> The <hi>Chineſe</hi> had no objection to receive a dead chriſtian; they permitted his interment; his coffin was filled with unſlacked lime, which miraculouſly loſt its nature, and the body, preſerved uninjured, was found entire, ſweet, and with all moiſture, fifty years after, <hi>(Du Halde</hi> ſays only as many months) and brought with due veneration to the city of <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM this period to the end of the ſame century,
<note place="margin">JESUITS.</note> no attempt was made to follow the great example of St. <hi>Xavier.</hi> A few <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0792500103:110"/>and <hi>Franciſcans</hi> would have landed in <hi>China</hi> with the ſame pious intention, could they have obtained leave. The honor of preaching the goſpel with any ſucceſs in this great empire, was reſerved for the riſing order of the Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valignon,</hi> ſuperior general of the order of the miſſion of <hi>India,</hi> reſident at <hi>Macao,</hi> burning with zeal for the great deſign, ſelected three of his ſociety for the purpoſe, <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Naples, Paſio</hi> of <hi>Bologna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">FATHER RICCI.</note> and <hi>Ricci</hi> of <hi>Macerata.</hi> The laſt was a man of ſuperior abilities, who with his two brethren had rendered themſelves maſters of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> language at <hi>Goa,</hi> before they began their miſſion. They entered on it in the year 1583. After ſeveral un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorable eſſays, <hi>Ricci</hi> found his way to the court; he had all the art and inſinuation of his order; a noble air, great ſweetneſs of temper, and an extenſive knowlege of the ſciences, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the mathematics. He came alſo provided with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; he gave the emperor a clock, a picture of our Saviour, and another of the Virgin, each of which, ſay the Jeſuits, had a moſt honorable place. <hi>Paſio</hi> and <hi>Roger</hi> had been recalled, and the whole power was veſted in <hi>Ricci;</hi> under whom crowds of ſubordinate Jeſuits preached the goſpel with the utmoſt ſucceſs. They ſeemed to have a toleration, or at leaſt a connivance. They reconciled the doctrine of their great maſter, and the rites of the Chriſtian religion, with the ceremonies of that of <hi>China. Ricci</hi> permitted his proſelytes to aſſiſt at the annual commemoration of the followers of <hi>Conſucius,</hi> and to intermingle the rites of both churches, ſo as to gain converts innumerable. He baptized ſeveral Mandarines and perſous of rank; among others two rich
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0792500103:111"/>widows, one by the name of <hi>Candida,</hi> the other that of <hi>Agatha.</hi> The wealthy founded churches; and the poor filled them with their numbers. Perſecutions were raiſed againſt them; but the abilities of <hi>Ricci</hi> overcame them all. He died highly reſpected, in 1610, at <hi>Peking,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Van Lye;</hi> and by the order of the emperor was moſt honorably interred in a garden allotted for that purpoſe. <hi>Ricci</hi> inconteſtibly merited the title he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, of founder and father of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> church.</p>
               <p>SEVERAL other Jeſuits of great abilities ſucceſſively ſupported his labors; a perſecution had been raiſed againſt them, but luck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily at the ſame time an invaſion was threatened by the <hi>Tartars.</hi> A Mandarine, a Chriſtian convert, adviſed the calling in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> engineers to direct the artillery; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was taken, and their ſucceſs again brought the Chriſtians into favor.</p>
               <p>FATHER <hi>Schaal</hi> was employed in caſting of cannon,
<note place="margin">FATHER VERBIEST.</note> and father <hi>Verbieſt,</hi> another Jeſuit of firſt rate abilities, was engaged in the ſame ſervice. It certainly was not the ſpiritual merits of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that gained them the patronage of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> emperors, but their knowlege of the arts. They had brethren of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, painters, mechanics, turners, watch-makers, founders, accomptants, aſtronomers, and maſters of ordnance. <hi>Verbieſt,</hi> and ſome of the ableſt of the fathers, were conſulted about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtate; and by thoſe various means became a moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful miniſtry. They were created Mandarines, and appeared at court in a rich dreſs of that order, with the dragon flaming on their breaſts. <hi>Cam-hi</hi> even iſſued an edict in favor of the Chriſtian
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0792500103:112"/>religion. Among the miracles of the times, an eunuch converted fifty ladies; and <hi>Helena Taming,</hi> empreſs of <hi>China,</hi> held epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary correſpondence with pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VIIth.</p>
               <p>UNFORTUNATELY for the Jeſuits, in 1631, an inundation of other miſſionaries poured into the empire.
<note place="margin">DOMINICANS.</note> The <hi>Dominicans</hi> and the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> were zealous to partake of the honor, and ſhare in the good work; but again, unluckily for both, the Jeſuits were more of this world, their rivals of the other. The laſt ſoon diſcovered the arts by which the Jeſuits had eſtabliſhed their power in <hi>China.</hi> They would not condeſcend to preach any but the pure doctrine of Chriſtianity; an inveterate quarrel enſued among theſe holy men. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> carried their complaints to <hi>Rome;</hi> the grounds of which were diſcuſſed in the higheſt eccleſiaſtical courts, and with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſucceſs. The monks had the moſt ſubtile orders to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract them. The controverſy laſted a hundred years; bulls had been ſent to <hi>Peking,</hi> to diſannul all the temporizing compliances of the Jeſuits with the religious rites of the <hi>Chineſe;</hi> ſome they evaded, and at other times, by their power at court, excited perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions againſt their chriſtian brethren. They even procured the impriſonment of <hi>Tournon,</hi> a legate from the Pope himſelf. His holineſs honored the ſufferer with the cardinal's hat; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it in conſinement, and ſoon after died, the ridicule of the political Jeſuits. The reader will find a very candid and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining account of the Chriſtian church by <hi>Moſhcim,</hi> in the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> Miſcellanies, publiſhed in 1762, in two ſmall volumes. My plan forbids me from entering further into the hiſtory; let it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0792500103:113"/>ſuffice to ſay, that the Jeſuits, from the death of <hi>Kam-hi,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced viciſſitudes of fortune; were either depreſſed or exalted according to the genius of his ſucceſſors, or according to the uſes to which they were found ſubſervient. The diſſolution of the order probably put an end to the Chriſtian church in this poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical empire

               <p>ANOTHER nation, eminent for extending their religion far and wide, could never effect, by the power of the ſword, what this artful order did by inſinuation, and by temporizing with the cuſtoms and manners of the people of whom they intended to make their advantages. The <hi>Arabs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ARABS.</note> who in other places incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the doctrine of their famed impoſtor by conqueſt and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, here never made the attempt; long maſters of the ſea, they came from the coaſts of <hi>Africa,</hi> or of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> in the form of traders, in the tenth century. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> admitted them into their ports in that character, but denied them permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to propagate their faith, as they had done in <hi>India.</hi> They were ſtrictly forbidden to make any converts, but were allowed the free exerciſe of their own religion, as long as they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with that of the empire. The <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> when they firſt arrived in <hi>China,</hi> found the cities full of <hi>Arabs</hi> or <hi>Moors,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Navarette,</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> miſſionary in <hi>China</hi> in 1665, informs us, that in his time there were about five hundred thouſand, which had greatly increaſed by intermarriages with the natives; that many of them took their degrees among the <hi>Chineſe</hi> literati;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0792500103:114"/>which evinces how the <hi>Arabs</hi> carried with them a thirſt after knowledge; but they were looked on by their brethren as apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, for mingling with a nation whoſe rites were ſo contrary to their own.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have been ſettled ſo many centuries in <hi>China,</hi> they are in many places conſidered as intruders, are treated moſt contemptuouſly by the vulgar, and ſometimes their moſques have been demoliſhed by the mob.</p>
               <p>LET me now return to the temporal concerns of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> empire.
<note place="margin">LAST REVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUTION.</note> The laſt revolution was effected in 1644. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Tſong-Ching,</hi> reduced to deſpair by a ſucceſsful rebellion, put himſelf to death; his brave general made head againſt the uſurper, but unfortunately, like our <hi>Vortigern,</hi> called in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a foreign power; he invoked the <hi>Manchew Tartars,</hi> who, headed by their monarch <hi>Tſong-te,</hi> united with him, and expelled the uſurper. <hi>Tſong-te</hi> died as ſoon as that was effected; but before his death, declared his infant ſon emperor of <hi>China.</hi> The general found his error too late, yet ſubmitted to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and ſupported the new ſucceſſion. From that time the <hi>Tartar</hi> line continued on the throne; but the prince, and all the <hi>Tartarian</hi> ſubjects he brought with him, adopted, in the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute articles, the antient rules of the empire, its laws and cuſtoms, and aſſumed the habits of the conquered people. <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Chineſe</hi> are admitted indifferently to places of truſt civil and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary. The <hi>Tartars</hi> compoſe moſt of the garriſons, but are now grown as effeminate as the <hi>Chineſe</hi> themſelves, and very little ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the native ſoldiery. The army of <hi>China</hi> conſiſts of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0792500103:115"/>ſeven hundred thouſand men, diſperſed in garriſons, or along the great wall; are well cloathed and armed, and make a fine figure on a review or on a march.</p>
               <p>THE characteriſtic features of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> in the males,
<note place="margin">FORM OF THE CHINESE.</note> are a large forehead, ſhort noſe, well cut ſmall eyes, a large and ſquare face, great broad ears, a middle ſized mouth, black hair, and a large and fat body. Theſe conſtitute beauty in our ſex. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions in general are as fair as <hi>Europeans,</hi> unleſs in the ſouthern provinces, or among the rank of people who are obliged to be expoſed to the open air.</p>
               <p>THE noſes of the females are ſhort, their eyes little, their ears long, their complexions ruddy, their features regular, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances gay; their feet artificially ſmall.
<note place="margin">LITTLE FEET.</note> It has ever been the cuſtom of the nurſes to bind thoſe parts ſo cloſe, as to prevent them from growing; they eſteem this a beauty, notwithſtanding it gives them a lameneſs in their gait; yet they think the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their feet a charm, and ſhew them as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>I SHALL now ſpeak of the genius of this ſingular people,
<note place="margin">ARTS.</note> and the progreſs they have made in the arts.</p>
               <p>I WILL begin with the medical.
<note place="margin">MEDICAL.</note> All their <hi>Materia Medica</hi> anſwers to our <hi>Galenical</hi> medicines, being drawn from ſimples; they have a good knowledge of the uſes of the vegetable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They never meddle with the violent remedies; gentle cathartics, emollients, ſtrengtheners, are the kinds they principally preſcribe. Green and bohea tea, the <hi>Ginſeng,</hi> and other ſalutary roots, are much in uſe. They are totally ignorant of anatomy, but pretend to great ſagacity in the knowledge of the pulſe; they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0792500103:116"/>not only judge of the ſpecies and nature of the diſeaſe, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their remedy according to the ſymptoms it exhibits. I refer to <hi>Du Halde</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. ii. p. 183.</note>, for the long but curious account of the practice. They were well acquainted with the circulation of the blood, long before the <hi>Europeans</hi> attained that knowlege. As they know nothing of anatomy, it muſt be by reaſoning on the force and action of the pulſe. They bleed, even with a bit of broken china.</p>
               <p>THEY had the knowlege of inoculation a great many years ago;
<note place="margin">INOCULATION.</note> it is a diſputed point whether the <hi>Turks</hi> (from whom we learned the ſalutary art) received it from the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> by means of the <hi>Armenian</hi> caravans, or whether the ſame people might not have communicated it to the <hi>Chineſe;</hi> certain it is that they have long been in poſſeſſion of the method; and the emperor <hi>Kam-hi</hi> made a noble uſe of it, ſending ſkilful perſons into <hi>Tartary,</hi> and other parts of his dominions, to inoculate the children of his <hi>Tartarian</hi> ſubjects, and others; the diſtemper in every part of the empire being dreaded to the higheſt degree, making the ſame havoc among theſe eaſtern people, as the plague in the weſtern world.</p>
               <p>THE art of printing was invented under the emperor <hi>Ming-Tſong,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">PRINTING.</note> about the year of our Lord 904, being above five hundred years before it was diſcovered in <hi>Europe.</hi> They trace the types through the written copy on blocks of wood; ſo never have occaſion to break the preſs, as we do in our quarter of the globe.</p>
               <p>THE manufacture of paper was originally diſcovered by <hi>Tſay-Jun,</hi>

                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0792500103:117"/>a great Mandarine of the palace, A.

The conſumption of paper in this empire is prodigious; the <hi>Cacoethes Scribendi</hi> occaſions an amazing demand, and the quantity uſed for the papering of their rooms is inconceivable. Their painted papers are more famed for the richneſs of the colors, than the juſtneſs and elegance of the deſign. They have no notion of perſpective, nor the leaſt ſkill in delineating the human figure, all which appear like ſo many caricatures.

               <p>THE emperor <hi>Kam-hi</hi> cauſed the wars againſt the <hi>Elaths,</hi> and thoſe on the frontiers of little <hi>Bucharia,</hi> to be painted, and ſent long after into <hi>Europe,</hi> in order to be engraven by the beſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts; theſe were the performances of the Jeſuits, and done in a very good manner.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0792500103:118"/>as thoſe in the fore, the plates were returned to be altered (which was done) quite to the taſte of the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> The mountain ſcenery is magnificent; the actions or ſurpriſes cruel and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary; the fortified places, and little wooden forts, exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, with various ſpecimens of the art military of theſe diſtant <hi>Aſiatics.</hi> I obſerved the <hi>Bactrian</hi> or two bunched camel much in uſe, carrying ſwivel guns on their backs, which were diſcharged at the fugitives climbing up the ſteeps of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.

               <p>THE uſe of artillery was not known among the <hi>Chineſe</hi> till the arrival of the <hi>Europeans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ARTILLERY.</note> The firſt cannon they ever ſaw, were three, ſent as a preſent to the emperor, by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> of <hi>Macao,</hi> in 1621. Theſe were afterwards uſed againſt the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who came in ſwarms to the great wall, but terrified by the ſlaughter made among them by theſe novel machines of war, they never approached it more.</p>
               <p>GUNPOWDER was invented in <hi>Europe</hi> by a monk;
<note place="margin">GUNPOWDER.</note> the firſt cannon ever caſt in <hi>China,</hi> were the work of a Jeſuit, Father <hi>Adam Schaal,</hi> by order of the emperor; the next of the father <hi>Verbieſt,</hi> the great ornament of the order; he firſt caſt a hundred and thirty, and after that three hundred and twenty. They were tried in the preſence of the emperor, who ſo greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the ſervices of <hi>Verhieſt,</hi> that he loaded him with honors. The Jeſuits, in return, fixed on a day for bleſſing his labors; dreſſed in his religious habit, he nine times proſtrated himſelf, and beat his forehead againſt the ground. He had previouſly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0792500103:119"/>fixed a crucifix on an altar before the train of artillery, which he baptized piece by piece, and gave to each the name of a male or female ſaint, taken from the calendar of his own church.</p>
               <p>GUNPOWDER was of very early invention in <hi>China</hi> and in <hi>India,</hi> but till the time that I have juſt mentioned, it was never applied to any other uſes than fire-works on feſtive occaſions, in which the <hi>Chineſe</hi> ſtill excel all the reſt of the world. I refer the reader to p. 362 of the preceding volume, for what I have ſaid on the ſubject of the powder and artillery of the Orientaliſts.</p>

                  <hi>Voltaire</hi> aſſerts that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> had a manufactory of glaſs above two thouſand years ago.

                  <hi>Du Halde</hi> ſays that looking glaſſes are not among their articles of furniture. They have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at <hi>Yen-ching,</hi> in the province of <hi>Shang-tung,</hi> a manufactory, but ſo brittle is their <hi>Lew-li,</hi> or glaſs, as to break when expoſed to too cold an air. I am farther confirmed by my worthy friend <hi>Thomas Fitzhugh,</hi> Eſquire, (long reſident in <hi>China)</hi> that the art of making glaſs in <hi>China</hi> was in a very imperfect ſtate, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me that about ſixty or ſeventy years they were ſupplied with that article from <hi>England,</hi> which would not have been the caſe had they excelled at home. The glaſs was carried over in pieces in the ſhape of bricks, from which trade it may be ſuppoſed the <hi>Chineſe</hi> either did not then make it, or that they found it more expenſive in the proceſs than purchaſing the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles from foreigners

               <p>THE very important article of ſilk ſhall next be ſpoken of.
<note place="margin">SILK.</note> In my account of <hi>Spain</hi> will be given the hiſtory of the origin of this manufacture, and the various countries it paſſed through in its way from <hi>China,</hi> its native ſeat. The care of the ſilk-worm was of the moſt early date; it was begun by <hi>Si-ling,</hi> one of the queens of <hi>Whang-ti,</hi> third emperor from <hi>Fo-hi,</hi> at the period in which his ſubjects ſtill clothed themſelves in the undreſſed ſkins of wild beaſts; how ſurpriſing was the change for the luxurious habit of ſilk. Succeeding empreſſes followed her example; they went attended by their fair ſuite to the orchard of mulberry trees, gathered the leaves of three trees, either with their own hands, or by the hands of the ladies under their inſpection. A piece of the fineſt ſilk was woven and devoted to the ceremony of the ſacrifice to the <hi>Shang-Ti,</hi> or the Supreme Being. More policy than religion is intermixed with this ſacrifice; the wiſe <hi>Chineſe</hi> knew that they could not inforce too ſtrongly the cultivation of a tree which feeds the great ſtaple of the empire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chineſe</hi> have two trees which contribute to this purpoſe;
<note place="margin">MULBERRY TREES.</note> the one is the <hi>Sang</hi> or <hi>Te-ſang,</hi> the <hi>Morus Alba</hi> or white mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry tree, ſo well known in the ſouth of <hi>Europe;</hi> this is culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0792500103:121"/>in plantations. The other kind is the <hi>Che,</hi> or <hi>Ye-ſang,</hi> the wild mulberry, which grows on the hills in foreſts, has ſmall roundiſh rough leaves ſcalloped on the edges, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in a point; the branches thorny; the fruit like pepper; in a few words a tree of a diſtinct ſpecies, if not genus, from the former. On theſe trees, the young of the ſilkworms which are hatched, are laid. The ſilk, produced from them, is ſaid to be ſtronger and earlier than from thoſe bred on the common mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry. Paths are cut among the foreſts of the <hi>Che,</hi> the ground is cleared of weeds which may give ſhelter to ſerpents that devour the worms; and perſons watch with guns to deſtroy the birds that make them their food; theſe trees are alſo cultivated in ſome places like the white mulberry.</p>
               <p>I SHALL make mention of a ſpecies of ſilk totally different in its origin from the preceding; this is deſcribed by <hi>Du Halde</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. i. 354.</note>,
<note place="margin">SILK OF PLINY.</note> who ſays it is made by certain worms in the province of <hi>Shang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tong.</hi> It is not fabricated by them into <hi>Cocons,</hi> but left adhering to ſmall trees or ſhrubs in form of very long threads, which are gathered and woven into a coarſe ſilk, called <hi>Kien chew,</hi> a very thick, laſting ſort, which waſhes well, and is in much eſteem with the <hi>Chineſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS account certainly vindicates the opinion held by the ancients that ſilk was an article combed from the leaves of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain trees. <hi>"Primi ſunt hominum"</hi> ſays <hi>Pliny</hi> (ſpeaking of the <hi>Scytharum Gen.</hi> lib. vi. c. xvii.)

                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0792500103:122"/>The Romans believed it to be the ſame kind which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at <hi>Rome</hi> from the ſilk-thread which had found its way there in the time of <hi>Pliny,</hi> which makes him complain of the great trouble the <hi>Roman</hi> women had in winding and weaving their ſilk, whilſt the <hi>Seres</hi> had no more to do than to gather it from the leaves of trees.

                  </q> It was long before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of ſilks was eſtabliſhed at <hi>Rome.</hi> The uſe was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by a law forbidding men to debaſe themſelves by the wearing of ſilk, as fit only for women. The effeminate <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus</hi> is the firſt on record who wore a dreſs entirely of ſilk. The manufactory even in the ribband or haberdaſhery way did not reach our kingdom till about the year 1482. <hi>Spain</hi> had very long the ſtart of us. Our monarchs were forced to be content with cloth ſtockings. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. accidentally got a pair now and then from <hi>Spain.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> preſented a pair to <hi>Edward</hi> VI. which was much talked of. Mrs. <hi>Montague,</hi> ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman to queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> preſented her with a pair of black ſilk, after which, her highneſs would never wear any of cloth. Broad ſilks were not woven in <hi>England</hi> till the year 1620. The ſouthern and weſtern parts of <hi>Europe</hi> for centuries poſſeſſed that ſpecies of manufacture.</p>

THE capital of theſe people is called by <hi>Ptolemy, Sera Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> and placed by him in Lat. 38° 36′, which ſo nearly agrees with the latitude of <hi>King-chew</hi> in the province of <hi>Pe-che-li,</hi> as to leave no doubt of that having been the ſite. I have, at p. 8. of the firſt volume of this work, mentioned the <hi>Comedae,</hi> and the ſtation of thoſe who were bound for the commerce with the <hi>Seres.</hi> A branch of the <hi>Imaus</hi> runs from thence to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, and after ſome ſpace to the eaſt. Part of the country to the ſouth-eaſt of this chain is the <hi>Scythia intra Imaum;</hi> and the part to the north-eaſt is the <hi>Serica Regio,</hi> or land of the <hi>Seres.</hi> Various towns or cities of little uſe to note are mentioned by <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> In his time the reſting places of the merchants in their road to the <hi>Sera Metropolis.</hi> We know no more than that there was a commerce carried on with this country by caravans from the more weſtern world; that it was interrupted by the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> who had poſſeſſed themſelves of moſt of the country from the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea to this branch of the <hi>Imaus;</hi> and by that means the intercourſe was entirely cut off.</p>
               <p>VERY long is the interval between that period and that in which we can find any travellers who had viſited this diſtant country by land. In the year 1660 <hi>Nicolo Polo</hi> and his brother <hi>Maffio,</hi> illuſtrious <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſet out on their commercial journey. They took their departure from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for the ſplendid courts of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> princes, who lived in great magnificence, and gave the utmoſt encouragement to the <hi>European</hi> merchants and artiſts to come among them, and improve them in the arts. <hi>William Ruyſbroek,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RUBRUQUIS.</note> better known by the name of Friar <hi>Rubruquis,</hi> made two journeys into great <hi>Tartary,</hi> and mentions <hi>Guillaume
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0792500103:125"/>L'Orfevre</hi> and other artiſts who were employed in the ſervice of <hi>Mongu-khan.</hi> To this day many rich proofs of the ſkill of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> artiſts are diſcovered in tombs and other places. The <hi>Polos</hi> remained nine years abroad; and returning, <hi>Nicolo</hi> found his wife dead; he had left her pregnant; the child ſurvived, and became the famous traveller ſo well known by the name of <hi>Marco Polo.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MARCO POLO.</note> His father in 1271 accompanied his brother on another journey, and took <hi>Marco,</hi> then only eleven years of age, with him. They arrived at the court of <hi>Kublay-Khan,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by the <hi>Chineſe, Shi-Tſu,</hi> fifth emperor of <hi>Cathay</hi> or northern <hi>China,</hi> of the <hi>Mogol</hi> race, a monarch of abilities, and a great encourager of the arts. He took a particular liking to young <hi>Marco,</hi> who ſoon learned to read and write the four languages in uſe in the country; he was in the ſervice of the emperor ſeventeen years. The royal reſidence during ſummer at that time was <hi>Kambalu</hi> or rather <hi>Hampalu, i. e.</hi> the ſeat of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> the ſame with the modern <hi>Pe-king;</hi> but the capital of the empire was the preſent <hi>Nanquin. Kublay-Khan</hi> made uſe of <hi>Marco</hi> on ſeveral important embaſſies and weighty affairs. The father and brother continued with the court; and in their commercial capacities contributed to its ſplendor by procuring jewels, and all the materials of luxury. <hi>Marco,</hi> his father, and uncle remained with the <hi>Khan</hi> a great number of years, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſafe to <hi>Venice</hi> in 1295, enriched by their profeſſion, and in the higheſt eſteem with their countrymen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marco</hi> wrote his travels, which have been publiſhed in moſt languages; he was a diligent and faithful obſerver. I muſt refer to <hi>Bergeron,</hi> to <hi>Purchas,</hi> but particularly to <hi>John Reinhold
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0792500103:126"/>Forſter,</hi> for the detail of his travels. He gives a moſt ſplendid account of the court of his maſter, and ſhews the ſtate of the polite arts in <hi>China</hi> in thoſe early days; mentions the uſe of the ſilk-worm, the knowlege of the making of paper from the <hi>Morus Papyriſera;</hi> the diſtillation of brandy from the milk of mares, and numbers of other curious circumſtances beyond the limits of my plan. <hi>Marco</hi> was alſo attentive to the natural hiſtory of the country; mentions coals, which he calls black combuſtible ſtones; deſcribes ſome ſorts of falcons and cranes; the <hi>Argus</hi> pheaſant, or pheaſants with tails thirty inches long, and in particular ſpeaks about the number of partridges and quails. He takes notice of the <hi>Muſk</hi> animal, <hi>Hiſt. Quad.</hi> i. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 65. The <hi>Thibet</hi> cows with long ſilky tails, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 8.

<note place="margin">RUSSIANS.</note> I ſhall not therefore introduce it here, but proceed to the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>China</hi> by ſea, by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> in the buſy ſixteenth century. In the year 1515 <hi>Alvarenga,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">PORTUGUESE.</note> the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> viceroy of the <hi>Indies,</hi> turned his thoughts towards a ſettlement in <hi>China;</hi> and beſtowed on <hi>Ferdinand Pedro Andrada,</hi> an able officer, the conduct of the expedition. In <hi>June</hi> 1517 he ſet ſail from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca,</hi> with three ſhips, and arrived at the iſland of <hi>Tamanlabua,</hi> four leagues from the main land of <hi>China.</hi> At that time the coaſt was infeſted with pirates; and fortunately <hi>Andrada</hi> fell in, ſays <hi>Oſorio</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. ii. p. 244.</note>, with the imperial fleet, who on ſight of him (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a pirate) prepared for battle; but how great was their ſurprize when they found that he gave no ſign of hoſtile inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſailed peaceably with them till they anchored off the iſle of <hi>Tama.</hi> I believe this to be the ſame which Mr. <hi>Nieuhoff</hi>

The <hi>Chineſe</hi> admiral there ſent to enquire who theſe ſtrange people were, and received ſuch an anſwer as quite gained his confidence. <hi>Andrada</hi> then ſailed with them for the port of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0792500103:128"/>
                  <hi>Nanto,</hi> a fine city and harbor about ſixty miles from <hi>Canton;</hi> there he met with the moſt hoſpitable reception, and by his prudent conduct quite conciliated the affection of the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> He landed there the embaſſador <hi>(Thomas Perez)</hi> who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conducted to the imperial court. <hi>Andrada</hi> returned to the iſle of <hi>Tama,</hi> informed himſelf of every thing that was neceſſary, and greatly enriched himſelf and companions by his commerce with the merchants, who flocked to him from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent countries. He left <hi>China</hi> after impreſſing on the nation the higheſt opinion of the integrity of his countrymen.</p>
               <p>ALL this was ruined by the ill conduct of <hi>Simon</hi> his brother, who ſoon after arrived there to form the ſettlement. After building a fort he thought himſelf ſecure, and began to offer inſults and violence of every kind to the natives, who fell on the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> killed numbers, and obliged <hi>Simon</hi> to ſecure himſelf by flight.</p>
               <p>THE emperor diſmiſſed the embaſſador, who on his arrival at <hi>Canton,</hi> was flung into priſon by the citizens, where he periſhed miſerably.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0792500103:129"/>(at will) from even their daily proviſion. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poſſeſſion of the city, and have a governor of their own; but a Mandarine reſides here who is ſupreme over the whole iſland, ſo that they are in a very dependant ſtate; and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides pay an annual tribute, on the original agreement of being permitted to erect fortifications. They enjoy their own laws and religion, and have a biſhop of <hi>Macao,</hi> ſuffragan to the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Goa.</hi>

               <p>OUR firſt factory in that empire was about the year 1701,
<note place="margin">FIRST AT CHUSAN.</note> when the <hi>Chineſe</hi> granted to us <hi>Chuſan,</hi> a ſmall iſland not far from the coaſt of <hi>Tche-Tchiang,</hi> in Lat. 30° 40′. It had been totally depopulated by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but began to be re-peopled when we ſettled there. The beſt account given of the place is by Mr. <hi>J. Cunningham,</hi> a very ingenious ſurgeon who attended our colony; he ſays
<note n="*" place="bottom">Ph. Tranſ. Abr. vol. v. p. 171.</note> it abounded with proviſions of all kind, and with cows, buffaloes, deer, goats, and wild hogs, and many kinds of eſculent plants; and with the tea ſhrub on the tops of the hills. The <hi>Kiew-yeu, Croton Sebiferum</hi>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0792500103:130"/>here, and many other parts of <hi>China;</hi> and grows as high as a tall cherry tree; the fruit opens like a cheſnut, and contains kernels enveloped with a pulp, which has all the properties of tallow; excellent candles, void of any ſmell, are made of it when melted; it alſo ſupplies the lamps with oil; <hi>Du Halde</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. i. p. 319.</note> gives us the proceſs. He alſo deſcribes a tree, called <hi>Pe-la-ſhu,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces wax; a kind of little worm faſtens on its leaves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being covered, in a ſhort time they form combs of wax, much ſmaller than the honey combs; this wax is very hard and ſhining, and conſiderably dearer than bees-wax. When theſe worms are accuſtomed to the trees of any diſtrict, they never quit them, but on particular occaſions; if once they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from a place they never return, ſo that others muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in their ſtead, there being merchants who deal in them.</p>
               <p>I cannot aſcertain the <hi>Genus</hi> or ſpecies of this tree. There is a <hi>Myrica cerifera</hi> in <hi>North America</hi> that affords a very good wax, <hi>Cateſby</hi> i. tab. 69; and another at the <hi>Cape of Good Hope, Journal Hiſtorique,</hi> &amp;c. p. 88. tab. oppoſite to the page; <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> i. p. 346. <hi>Myrica Aethiopica Lin.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sparman</hi> ſays, that the berries are covered at a certain time of the year with a greeniſh, wax-like and tallowy ſubſtance, which he ſuppoſes to be the effect of inſects: of this the natives make candles. I ſhould think it the ſame with the ſpecies juſt deſcribed; but, that <hi>Du Halde</hi> ſays, the inſects in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> plants depoſit their wax on the leaves. In the <hi>Aethiopica</hi> it is found on what <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> calls cones.</p>

               <p>OUR factory at <hi>Chuſan</hi> was not of long duration; but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Canton,</hi> which, by a decree of the emperor, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to be the only port allotted for the <hi>European</hi> commerce.

THE <hi>Dutch</hi> made their firſt ſettlement for the benefit of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> on the iſle of <hi>Formoſa;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">DUTCH.</note> and deceitfully, under pretence of building a houſe, erected a ſtrong fort, ſo as to command the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the port they had ſixed on; it was ſaid that they made uſe of the ſtale <hi>Phoenician</hi> ſtratagem of the ox's hide, in the building of <hi>Byrſa,</hi> or the famous <hi>Carthage.</hi> The <hi>Japaneſe</hi> had not long before made a conqueſt of the iſland, but were too weak to reſent this perfidy. The <hi>Dutch</hi> now were in poſſeſſion of a flouriſhing trade, with the two great empires of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan.</hi> It was loſt to them in the year 1661 by the fault of the factions which reigned at <hi>Batavia,</hi> the ſeat of the <hi>Dutch</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>India. Iquon,</hi> a taylor, who lived in the <hi>Dutch</hi> town on the iſland of <hi>Formoſa,</hi> a man of undaunted courage, had revolted from the <hi>Chineſe</hi> empire, and became ſo powerful as to induce the Emperor to get him ſeized by perſidy and poiſoned;
<note place="margin">COXENGA.</note> his ſon <hi>Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enga,</hi> inherited all his abilities. At firſt he applied to the <hi>Dutch</hi> for ſuccor; but being refuſed, turned his reſentment againſt them. He prepared a vaſt fleet, and army; landed near the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſettlement, and notwithſtanding every effort of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, <hi>Frederick Cojet</hi> (whoſe defence was gallant and obſtinate) at length compelled him to ſurrender by capitulation. <hi>Cojet</hi> had been at firſt neglected by his countrymen, who when it was too late, ſent a ſtrong fleet from <hi>Batavia;</hi> it met with a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, and was compelled to leave their colony to its fate. We ſhall hereafter meet the <hi>European</hi> nations at their common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive ſettlement at <hi>Canton.</hi> I ſhall quit the ſubject I have been on, and change it to that of a particular topography of the coaſts of the vaſt empire.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak generally;
<note place="margin">BOUNDARIES OF CHINA.</note> the country may be ſaid to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0792500103:137"/>to the ſouth from <hi>Thibet</hi> and <hi>Boutan,</hi> by chains of moſt exalted mountains, branches of the <hi>Imaus</hi> and <hi>Hemodus;</hi> they penetrate even into various parts of <hi>China:</hi> other mountains equally high, ſeparate the empire from weſtern <hi>Tartary.</hi> Theſe vaſt Alpine chains are the defences of this mighty empire from invaſions by land. The great wall (hereafter to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) ſecures the parts unprotected by nature. The coaſt is uſually rude and rocky, and the interior often riſes into craggy pictureſque mountains, or is interſected by numerous rivers and canals. The ſeas are ſhallow, ſo that even from a naval attack the country has its protection.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING part of <hi>China</hi> is within the tropics, and the great remainder does not exceed Lat. 43 north, yet the cold is, during winter, intenſe. There is no country in which exiſts ſuch a neceſſity for furs; their own empire, <hi>Tartary,</hi> and <hi>Siberia</hi> is almoſt exhauſted for the ſupply; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> even furniſh them with quantities from <hi>North America.</hi> Ice has been ſeen at <hi>Canton</hi> an inch in thickneſs. Between <hi>Nimpo</hi> and <hi>Peking</hi> the cold has been ſo ſevere in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February</hi> that travellers have been forced to lie by, till the ice could be broken on the river <hi>Hoambo,</hi> the largeſt in <hi>China,</hi> before they could paſs over. Mr. <hi>Kirwan</hi> ſays, that the greateſt cold at <hi>Peking</hi> (in Lat. 39° 55′) is 5°, the greateſt heat 98; yet on <hi>July</hi> 25th, 1773, the thermometer roſe to 108 and 110. The extremeſt cold is produced by a north-eaſt or north-weſt wind; the laſt blows over the vaſt tract of <hi>Tartary</hi> and <hi>Siberia.</hi> In <hi>Peking,</hi> during winter, the animals and fowls of all kinds are expoſed to ſale in the markets, frozen, and ſo preſerved from putrefaction for weeks together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0792500103:138"/>THE interior of <hi>China</hi> maintains a moſt ſingular character; it is varied with chains of mountains winding along its ſurface, yet ſo as to leave vallies that enabled one of the emperors to open a communication by water, partly by means of rivers and partly by navigable canals, from <hi>Peking</hi> to <hi>Canton,</hi> a diſtance of 1500 miles: little interruption occurs in this vaſt ſpace, except the lofty mountains which ſeparate the provinces of <hi>Kiang-ſee</hi> and <hi>Quan-Tung.</hi> We ſhall ſpeak farther of this, and the other canals, in their proper places.</p>
               <p>I SHALL now enter on the topographical account,
<note place="margin">ISLAND OF HAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAN.</note> commencing at its ſouthern extremity. The iſland of <hi>Hainan, i. e.</hi> the ſouth of the ſea, expreſſes its ſituation. It belongs to the province of <hi>Quang-tung</hi> (which, oppoſite to <hi>Hai-nan,</hi> juts far ſouth in a peninſulated form) and is diſtant above twelve miles from the ſhore; is a hundred and ſixty leagues in circumference, and produces every thing that can conduce to the wants and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of life; the climate alone is bad, by reaſon of the quality of the water.
<note place="margin">GOLD.</note> The iſland abounds with gold; but as it has been but half conquered, that valuable metal is in the power of the natives, a brave, independent people, who live in the middle parts, amidſt arduous mountains; the reſt of the country being a plain. The inhabitants had long a traffic with the <hi>Chineſe;</hi> one was deputed to examine the goods offered; and on the other part a <hi>Chineſe</hi> merchant went to ſee thoſe of the mountaineers: the utmoſt honor was obſerved on both ſides. The <hi>Chineſe,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the governor, made immenſe profit of the gold. This the great <hi>Kang-hi</hi> diſcovered, and put a final ſtop to a commerce which till then had been allowed by law. The <hi>Lapis Armenus,</hi> which produces blue ſo much in requeſt for coloring the porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0792500103:139"/>is alſo found here, and much of it ſent to <hi>Canton</hi> for that purpoſe. The fiſheries are very lucrative, twenty or thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand jonks, of no inconſiderable ſize, come annually from <hi>Canton</hi> to take in cargoes of the dried or ſalted fiſh. Our company's ſhips now and then put in here, and may be ſecure during the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoons.</p>
               <p>THE continent, after attaining the bottom of the peninſula, trends towards the north-eaſt, and is all the way ſkirted with iſles. Thoſe beſt known to mariners are the two <hi>Sanciams,</hi> the <hi>Falſe,</hi> and that called <hi>Saint John</hi>'s, beneath which is good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorage. The great <hi>Ladrone</hi> and the <hi>Aſſes Ears</hi> are noted land marks. The entrance of the vaſt bay of <hi>Canton</hi> opens to the eaſt of <hi>Sanciam;</hi> the breadth there is about two and twenty leagues, and the depth nearly the ſame; but filled with iſlands divided by moſt narrow and intricate channels; poſſibly theſe might be the <hi>gates</hi> of <hi>China</hi> mentioned by the two <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> travellers of the ninth century, as <hi>Canton</hi> was their <hi>Canfu,</hi> even at that time a moſt flouriſhing city. It was alſo the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectum</hi> of the <hi>Nubian</hi> geographer
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 35.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanciam</hi> is famed for having been the place of interment of <hi>Saint Francis de Xavier,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ISLE OF SAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIAM.</note> and for his tomb, which ſtill is to be ſeen. Another iſle is that of <hi>Hoan-pou,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> had built a fort in order to command the navigation of the <hi>Tigris,</hi> or river of <hi>Canton.</hi> Their deſign was diſcovered, and they were all maſſacred.</p>
               <p>THE moſt important city is that of <hi>Macao,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MACAO.</note> ſeated on a little peninſula, and which was, during a certain period, celebrated
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0792500103:140"/>for its wealth and commerce; it is now quite declined from its former ſplendor, but is well known to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> as the place where their ſhips commonly anchor in their way inward, and from being the reſidence of all the <hi>European</hi> factories, who are obliged by the <hi>Chineſe</hi> to quit <hi>Canton</hi> as ſoon as the ſhips have left the river.
<note place="margin">TYPA.</note> About ſix miles lower is the <hi>Typa,</hi> a harbor for careening of ſhips. Here Commodore <hi>Anſon</hi> heaved down the <hi>Centurion</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1743, previous to the capture of the <hi>Manilla</hi> ſhip on <hi>June</hi> 20th, old ſtile, which eſtabliſhed the great fortunes of that lucky houſe.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Hu-men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">BOCCA TIGRIS.</note> or <hi>Tigers-gate,</hi> or the <hi>Bocca-tigris</hi> of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> is the narrow paſs into that river, which is not a muſket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot over, and defended by two miſerable batteries. Mr. <hi>Anſon</hi> paſſed them in his way to the <hi>Canton</hi> river. The poor pilot, who reluctantly carried him through, and the mandarine who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the forts, were moſt ſeverely puniſhed for what they could not poſſibly help; the commodore having threatened to hang the pilot in caſe of non-compliance. The poor mandarine knew his own weakneſs. The real mouth of the river is ſome miles below the <hi>Bocca,</hi> and has on one ſide the <hi>Lion</hi>'s tower, or pagoda. The river takes from thence a grand curvature towards the weſt. The anchoring place for the <hi>European</hi> ſhips is under the iſle of <hi>Wampoo,</hi> a few miles to the eaſt of <hi>Canton.</hi> The approach into the bay, and the amazing view along the river, is ſo graphically deſcribed by my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite M. <hi>Le Poivre,</hi> that I cannot reſiſt uſing the words of that enchanting author.
<q>On the appearance of land (ſays he) I perceived along the horizon a foreſt of maſts, and ſoon
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0792500103:141"/>after an innumerable multitude of boats, which covered the ſurface of the water: theſe were thouſands of fiſhermen, whoſe induſtry drew from the deeps ſubſiſtence for numbers. The land now began to riſe to my view. I advanced to the mouth of the river, ſtill amidſt crowds of fiſhers, throwing out their lines on every ſide. I entered the river of <hi>Kanton;</hi> it is people like the land; its banks lined with ſhips at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor; a prodigious number of ſmall craft are continually gliding along in every direction, ſome with ſails, others with oars, vaniſhing often ſuddenly from the ſight, as they enter the numberleſs canals, dug with amazing labour acroſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive plains, which they water and fertilize. Immenſe fields, covered with all the glory of the harveſt, with ſtately villages riſing to the eye on every ſide, adorn the remoter view, whilſt mountains, covered with verdure, cut into terraces, and ſhaped into amphitheatres, form the back ground of this noble land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Chineſe</hi> divide their cities into firſt rate, ſecond, and third.
<note place="margin">CANTON.</note> The firſt may be known by the addition of <hi>foo,</hi> the ſecond by that of <hi>tchoo,</hi> the third by that of <hi>hyen. Quang-tchoo-foo,</hi> or <hi>Canton,</hi> is chief among the firſt, as it is ſuppoſed to contain a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of inhabitants. <hi>Fachan,</hi> a village a few miles higher, has the ſame number. This in ſome meaſure inclines us to think that <hi>Voltaire</hi>'s calculation is not very far out of the way.
<note place="margin">VERY POPULOUS.</note> The land, and the very water is inhabited. Millions live in the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panes,</hi> or veſſels, placed on each ſide of the great rivers. Thoſe of <hi>Canton</hi> alone may contain two hundred and twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five thouſand inmates. Thouſands and thouſands dwell on the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0792500103:142"/>exalted rocks; ſome are excavated into manſions, and every ledge has on its its elegant cottage; ſwarms of people inhabit the edges of precipices, as the myriads of birds do the great promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of <hi>Britain.</hi> Paths are cut through the rocks to render them acceſſible, and over ſome are conducted even public roads. I have ſeen ſeveral of theſe populated rocks moſt accurately repreſented in rice, with all the oeconomy of their inhabitants expreſſed.</p>
               <p>THE city is divided into three; the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> and a third beyond the firſt, which is repreſented on the plan as a void ſpace. The ſtreets are narrow, but well paved; and croſs each other at right angles. The whole is ſurrounded with a wall; and each city ſeparated from the other by another wall. The gates of <hi>Canton</hi> are ſhut in the evening, as are the barriers at the end of every ſtreet, ſo that the greateſt cities are as quiet as a private family.</p>
               <p>TRIUMPHAL arches are very frequent in moſt of the cities;
<note place="margin">TRIUMPHAL ARCHES.</note> the ancient are the moſt elegant, adorned with beautiful figures of men, birds, and flowers in alt-relief, quite ſtanding from the ſtone, and connected only by cordons left for the purpoſe. Theſe monuments are probably honorary memorials of the great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of individuals.</p>
               <p>IN front, on each ſide of the city, and on the oppoſite ſhore of the river,
<note place="margin">EUROPEAN FACTORIES</note> are large ſuburbs. The factories of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> merchants conſiſt of a long row of houſes, ranged on the river ſide, and a ſpace of land behind, about two hundred yards broad; each has a warehouſe for its goods. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile nations are the <hi>Engliſh, French, Imperialiſts, Dutch, Swedes</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi> Each factory has the flag of its country
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0792500103:143"/>erected before it on a tall pole. This is the only port in the whole empire allowed to the <hi>Europeans.</hi> Their ſhips may take in wood and water where they pleaſe, but are every where elſe ſtrictly forbid to trade; even here they are a ſort of priſoners, they are not to go beyond their bounds; they may indeed enter the ſuburbs, but are ſure to meet with every ſpecies of abuſe from the mob. They are allowed to reſide only during the time the ſhips remain at <hi>Wampu;</hi> for as ſoon as they ſail for <hi>Europe</hi> every factory is obliged to retire to <hi>Macao</hi> till the ſeaſon of their return.</p>
               <p>THE proper name of the river of <hi>Canton</hi> is <hi>Ta-Ho,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RIVER OF CANTON.</note> or the great river. The ſtream is rapid, but affected by the tide which riſes four or five feet oppoſite to the city; it is navigable for numbers of miles into the interior parts of the country for large veſſels, from the ſea even to the city of <hi>Quang-ſi;</hi> and again its advantages are ſpread far and wide by the infinity of canals. Not only this, and other cities, but the canals themſelves, for miles together, have their quays made of cut ſtone of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous ſize, forming the moſt magnificent ſight which art, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to commercial purpoſes, can exhibit.</p>
               <p>THE river of <hi>Canton</hi> is guarded by various fortifications. The ſquare caſtle on the iſland, engraven by Mr. <hi>Nieuhoff,</hi> is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that kind of defence.</p>
               <p>THE multitudes of ducks which animate the river about <hi>Canton</hi> is amazing;
<note place="margin">TAME DUCKS.</note> "they are hatched," ſays Mr. <hi>Latham</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Ornith. Vol. iii. 492.</note>
                  <q>by artificial heat; the eggs being laid in boxes of ſand, are placed on a brick hearth, to which is given a proper heat during the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0792500103:144"/>required time for hatching. The ducklings are fed with little craw-fiſhes and crabs, boiled and cut ſmall, and afterwards mixed with boiled rice, and in about a fortnight ſhift for themſelves, when the <hi>Chineſe</hi> provide them an old ſtep-mother, who leads them where they are to find provender for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being firſt put on board a <hi>Sampane,</hi> or boat, which is deſtined for their habitation, and from which the whole flock, often to the amount of three or four hundred, go out to feed, and return at command. This method is uſed nine months out of the twelve (for in the colder months it does not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) and is ſo far from a novelty, that it may be every where ſeen; but more eſpecially about the time of cutting the rice and gleaning the crop, when the maſters of the duck <hi>Sampanes</hi> row up and down the river, according to the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of procuring food, which is found in plenty at the tide of ebb on the rice plantations, as they are overflowed at high water. It is curious to ſee how the ducks obey their maſter; for ſome thouſands, belonging to different boats, will feed at large on the ſame ſpot, and on a ſignal given will follow their leader to their reſpective <hi>Sampanes,</hi> without a ſtranger being found among them. This is ſtill more extraordinary if we conſider the number of inhabited <hi>Sampanes</hi> on the <hi>Tigris,</hi> ſuppoſed to be no leſs than forty thouſand, which are moored in rows cloſe to each other, with a narrow paſſage at intervals for boats to paſs up and down the river. The <hi>Tigris</hi> at <hi>Canton</hi> is ſomewhat wider than the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and the whole river is there covered in this manner for the extent of at leaſt a mile.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0792500103:145"/>THE manner of taking the wild ducks in this country is ſingular.
<note place="margin">WILD DUCKS, HOW TAKEN.</note> The performers put their heads into the ſhells of large gourds, with holes made in them to ſee and breathe through; then going naked into the water, they walk or ſwim ſo low, that nothing appears but the gourds. The ducks, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſee gourds floating on the ſurface, and to play about them, approach without fear; when the duck-hunter, taking them by the feet, pulls them under water to prevent their making a noiſe, wrings their necks, and faſtens them to his girdle, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his exerciſe till he has procured a great number.</p>
               <p>I MAY mention here that moſt elegant of ducks,
<note place="margin">CHINESE TEAL.</note> the <hi>Chineſe Teal</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Latham, Ornith. Vol. iii. 548.</note>; but words are almoſt wanting to expreſs the beauty of the coloring, and the ſpecific oddity of the fine feathers of the wings, erecting themſelves in a curved manner when the wings are cloſed. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s repreſentation
<note n="†" place="bottom">Tab. 102.</note> may ſerve to give the idea. Theſe are a ſcarce ſpecies, and kept for ſale at <hi>Canton,</hi> and ſold at the rate of ſix or even ten dollars the pair.</p>
               <p>No country abounds with fiſhes equal to <hi>China,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">FISHES.</note> yet we have been very unfortunate by the inattention paid to that branch of its natural hiſtory. <hi>Oſbeck</hi> and <hi>Sparman,</hi> both boaſted diſciples of <hi>Linnaeus,</hi> have given us but a very meagre catalogue. From theſe, and a few other ſources, I ſhall give all that I can collect; let me obſerve that the moſt numerous <hi>genera</hi> of freſh water are the carp and the perch. <hi>Du Halde</hi> mentions ſome curious ſpecies of fiſhes, but his deſcriptions want the perſpicuity of a naturaliſt, ſo are unintelligible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Du Halde</hi> ii. p. 316. gives us two very curious methods of

Then the fiſhermen turning their boats about, at the ſignal given by ſtriking the water with an oar, the cormorants fly into the river, one here, another there, and diving to the bottom, ſeize the fiſh they light on by the middle; then riſing up again, they carry it to the bark, where the fiſherman receiving it, takes the bird, and holding its head downwards, paſſes his hand along the neck to make it diſgorge the ſmall fiſh that it had ſwallowed, but is hindred from going into the gullet by a ring put on the lower part of the neck; which after the fiſhing is quite over, they take off and give them ſomething to eat. When the fiſh happens to be too large for one bird, they mutually aſſiſt each other; one takes the tail, another the head, and bring it to the boat to their maſter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE other way of taking fiſh is very ſimple, and gives but little trouble; for this purpoſe they make uſe of long narrow
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0792500103:147"/>boats, nailing on each ſide from one end to the other, a plank two feet broad. This plank is japanned with white ſhining varniſh, and ſlants gently till it almoſt touches the top of the water; in the night time, when it is uſed, they turn it towards the moon, that the reflection may increaſe its ſplendor, ſo that the fiſh which are ſporting, eaſily miſtaking the color of the japanned plank for that of the water, leap often on that ſide, and fall either on the plank or into the boat.</p>
               <p>IN reſpect to quadrupeds,
<note place="margin">QUADRUPEDS.</note> this empire retains many of thoſe of <hi>India,</hi> but loſes alſo ſeveral towards the northern and weſtern parts: others appear ſuited to the climate; theſe are pointed out in the <hi>Faunula,</hi> which I reſerve as a ſort of appendix, unwilling to interrupt the narrative part of this work.</p>
               <p>AT <hi>Canton</hi> begins the celebrated paſſage by water from hence to <hi>Peking,</hi>

The emperor <hi>Shi-tſu</hi> finding the defect of tribute he annually ſuſtained, or the vaſt loſs of his ſubjects in the articles of commerce which periſhed at ſea in the conveyance from the maritime parts of his dominions, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on creating an internal navigation.
<note place="margin">IMPERIAL CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL.</note> He began the work in 1289; it is probable that he did not complete ſo ſtupendous an undertaking; and it is imagined it was not finiſhed till the time of <hi>Yong-Jo,</hi> who began his reign about thirty-five years after. We may well admit this, as the length of the imperial canal is nine hundred miles, the depth a fathom and a half, and it conveys annually near ten thouſand large barks belonging to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0792500103:148"/>the Emperor, beſides others innumerable, the property of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or of private people, who hire them to travellers. They are all richly ornamented, eſpecially the imperial, which carry on them the dragon of five claws, the arms of the empire. The traveller, if he takes the route of <hi>Quang-ſi</hi> and <hi>Hu-quang,</hi> is under no neceſſity of ever quitting his bark from <hi>Canton</hi> to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;</hi> he meets with rivers and lakes till he falls in again with the <hi>Yu-Ho,</hi> or <hi>Royal Canal,</hi> as it is named by way of pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. On that canal the voyager is only obliged to quit his veſſel once in nine hundred miles; the mountain <hi>Meylin</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes, and makes it neceſſary for him to take a day's journey before he can again benefit of the royal work. The ſhipping on the canal and rivers are often ſo numerous as to fill the channel for a mile or two, and quite obſtruct for a time their progreſs.</p>
               <p>GREAT fairs are alſo kept on the rivers.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0792500103:149"/>That able writer was born on <hi>July</hi> 22d, 1618, at <hi>Uffen,</hi> in the earldom of <hi>Bentham,</hi> of a reſpectable family; his perſon was elegant, his underſtanding good, his temper and converſation amiable; he was fond of the fine arts, poetry, muſic, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and maſter of ſeveral languages. In the year 1646 he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the <hi>Dutch Weſt India</hi> ſervice, and made his firſt voyage to the <hi>Brazils,</hi> where he reſided nine years. He has left us an admirable deſcription of the country, and of the many great events of that period which happened between his countrymen and the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HIS next voyage was to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> in the year 1653. He viſited the coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi> the peninſula of <hi>Malacca,</hi> and many of the iſlands, even to the <hi>Moluccas.</hi> His accounts are the moſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory of any extant; his attention to ſeveral branches of natural hiſtory was very conſiderable; and he has given various plates of the fiſhes of the <hi>Indies,</hi> done with much accuracy, conſidering the infant ſtate of the ſcience. On this voyage he was eight years ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from home. His laſt voyage (deſigned alſo for the <hi>Eaſt Indies)</hi> was begun on <hi>January</hi> 1ſt, 1672.

Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent enquiry was made after him by the ſurviving part of the crew left on board his ſhip, and afterwards a yatch was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched from the <hi>Cape of Good Hope</hi> to repeat the ſearch, which proved equally fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>HIS brother, <hi>Henry Nieuhoff,</hi>

The learned <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> has tranſlated into <hi>Latin</hi> the famous journey from <hi>Canton</hi> to <hi>Peking.</hi> This is ſo curious and novel, that I ſhall attend the able traveller in his route, and briefly notice the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things.
<note place="margin">HIS TRAVELS TO PEKING.</note> An embaſſy was determined on by the <hi>Dutch</hi> to the coaſt of <hi>Peking,</hi> to the great emperor <hi>Kang-hi. Nieuhoff</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately appointed ſecretary. His account is a firſt-rate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; and the more pleaſing, as it is attended with views of the country, cities, and buildings, engraven from drawings done by his ſkilful pencil.</p>
               <p>THE embaſſadors had every poſſible reſpect paid to them; they embarked at <hi>Canton,</hi> on board a magnificent jonk, on <hi>March</hi> 17th, 1656, amidſt the acclamations of the people, and a general diſcharge of the artillery. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> ſent <hi>avant-cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers</hi> from place to place to make proviſions for their reception, even till their arrival at <hi>Peking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY began with aſcending the river <hi>Pei-kyang-ho,</hi> all their route was marked with beautiful ſcenery, and various towns and cities, moſt of them ſurrounded with embattled walls, and ſtrengthened by ſquare towers. Many of the landſcapes are moſt pictureſque. We are ſtruck with the river flowing by the vaſt mountain <hi>Sang-won-hab,</hi> over-hanging on both ſides; and on one a great frequented road,
<note place="margin">STRANGE ROAD.</note> cut out of the ſolid rock, impending over the water. At the foot is a pagoda, the nightly haunt (ſay the natives) of daemons.</p>
               <p>FARTHER on,
<note place="margin">CITY XAOCHEW.</note> not remote from the city <hi>Xaochew</hi> or <hi>Tchau-tchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foo,</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0792500103:151"/>a vaſt mountain ſeems to open its ſides to make room for the famed pagoda <hi>Konjan-Sjam,</hi> filled with horrid idols, to whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtant ſacrifices are offered by the fanatical viſitants.</p>
               <p>A LITTLE farther is the great caſtle <hi>Mongley,</hi> of a quadrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form, with a ſquare tower at each corner; equal in ſize within to a town; ſeated on a loſty eminence, and acceſſible by a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous flight of ſteps cut out of the live rock.</p>
               <p>THE city <hi>Xaochew</hi> next appears, near the conflux of two rapid rivers, infamous for frequent wrecks. A pagoda is erected on the banks, famed for its idol, to which mariners ſend up their prayers for a ſafe paſſage, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did of old, and as the Chriſtians of many parts of <hi>Europe</hi> do to their Saint <hi>Elmo</hi> to this very day.</p>

They are of a columnar form, and appear as if placed in order by human art.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nanhang</hi> or <hi>Nan-ſheun-foo,</hi> in Lat. 25° 11′ 58″,
<note place="margin">CITY NANHANG.</note> is the laſt in the province of <hi>Quang-tung,</hi> and a conſiderable trading city; to the north of it is a famous road over the mountain <hi>Meylin,</hi> cut through the rock, three miles in length, with precipices on both ſides, but of a ſecure wideneſs. This ſingular road being a great communication from north to ſouth, is perpetually crowded as much as the ſtreets of the moſt populous cities; on the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit is built a temple in honor of the mandarine who made this uſeful way at his own expence.</p>
               <p>AFTER travelling ſome days on horſeback,
<note place="margin">NANGAN.</note> Mr. <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> reached the great city <hi>Nangan,</hi> in the province of <hi>Kyang-ſee,</hi> ſeated on
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0792500103:152"/>the river <hi>Kanhyang,</hi> in Lat. 28° 37′ 12″. This river runs through the middle of the province, and divides it into two equal parts. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> call it <hi>Kan-kiang,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">THE KYANG RIVER.</note> or ſon of the ſea, and added that "the ſea is without ſhore, and the <hi>Kyang</hi> without bottom;" this fiction ariſes from the fiſhermen never uſing any ſounding lines above ſixty fathoms long, but even that depth is a vaſt one for a river. By means of the numerous canals that branch from it, the city has vaſt commerce, and was once celebrated for its porcelain of a ſnowy whiteneſs. The province is rich in mines of gold, ſilver, iron, lead, and tin. The ſilks are very beautiful; and the rice, and wine made from it, is in high eſteem in all parts of the empire.</p>
               <p>THE lakes of this province are in the ſeaſon covered with the beautiful bloſſoms of the <hi>Nymphaea Lotus</hi> and <hi>Nelumbo;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">NYMPHAEA NELUMBO.</note> no flowers are in ſuch requeſt with the <hi>Chineſe</hi> as theſe. The great men have them tranſplanted into their little ponds, filled for the purpoſe with mud and water, in their courts. The phyſicians eſteem the fruit as highly reſtorative after long ſickneſs; and the root of the <hi>Nelumbo</hi> is a common food, either eaten raw or made into meal; ſo that theſe plants are of the firſt uſe in this empire.</p>
               <p>

<note place="margin">PEKKINSA.</note> 
                  <hi>Pekkinſa</hi> is the next city, a moſt flouriſhing place, which ſupplies the mariners with all kind of neceſſaries for their veſſels.</p>
               <p>NOT far from thence are various ſpecimens of ſeveral lofty rocky hills,

               <p>
                  <hi>Nang-tchang-foo</hi> is a city ſeated in Lat. 29° 30′,

               <p>ABOUT thirty miles farther to the north of <hi>Nan-tchang,</hi> the waters of the lake unite with thoſe of the great river <hi>Kyang,</hi> which is continued from thence to the ſea.
<note place="margin">HOO-TCHOO.</note> The city <hi>Hoo-tchoo</hi> ſtands on the eaſtern bank of the junction. A few miles up the river to the weſt, is the city <hi>Kyew Kiang,</hi> the rendezvous of the barks of many parts of the empire. The river runs gently from hence to the ſea with a courſe almoſt imperceptible; but is at full and new moon affected by the tide.</p>
               <p>IN the <hi>Kyang</hi> near that city, where the river is a league broad,
<note place="margin">THE FISH WHANG-YU.</note> is found the <hi>Whang-yu</hi> or yellow fiſh, that often weighs eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; it is remarkably firm, and moſt excellent eating; theſe fiſh are taken in certain ſeaſons when they come out of the lake <hi>Poyang</hi> into the river.

                  <hi>Tong-lyu, Ufun, Anhing,</hi> and <hi>Teytong,</hi> appear moſt delightfully ſeated on the river. <hi>Tong-lyu</hi> bears numerous marks of the ravages of the <hi>Tartars;</hi> at <hi>Ufun</hi> is a manufacture of arms famous throughout all the empire.</p>
               <p>THE great city of <hi>Nanking</hi> or <hi>Nanquin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">NANQUIN.</note> in Lat. 32° 4′ 30″, is ſeated on an extenſive plain, near a league from the river, but united to it by ſeveral canals, capable of bringing up the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial barks, which are as large as middle ſized ſhips. This city was once the capital of <hi>China,</hi> till it was removed to <hi>Peking.</hi> It was the <hi>Chambdan</hi> of the <hi>Nubian</hi> geographer, on a river of the ſame name, which he ſays
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 69.</note> was the largeſt in <hi>China.</hi> The <hi>Tartars</hi> made themſelves maſters of this city in 1127, and before they deſerted it, burnt the magnificent imperial palace, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the famous obſervatory, and violated and deſtroyed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres of the emperors and other diſtinguiſhed perſonages. The city is reported to be ninety miles in circumference; later
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0792500103:155"/>ſurveys have made it only eighteen, but it certainly had been of far greater extent; much is now a waſte, and retains all the marks of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> fury, but enough is inhabited to make it a moſt populous and flouriſhing city. Of the parts which eſcaped the rage of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> ravages, is the <hi>Porcelain tower,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">PORCELAIN TOWER.</note> a pagoda of nine ſtages, of moſt exquiſite workmanſhip, and lined with beautiful tiles of <hi>Porcelain,</hi> from which it derives its name. It is far the moſt beautiful in <hi>China.</hi> Mr. <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> gives a fine view of this curious ſtructure, as he does of one of the modern ſtreets, the ſigns, and manner of building; the walls of the city, ſome of the gates, and idol temples, evince its former grandeur; it is beſides the ſeat of the literati, and conſequently abounds with fine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, and is eminent for its bookſellers ſhops, paper, ink, and all that can feed the <hi>Cacoethes ſcribendi.</hi> It is not without other manufactures; its fattins are in high requeſt, as are the woollen cloths fabricated here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nanquin</hi> is garriſoned partly by <hi>Chineſe,</hi> partly by <hi>Tartars;</hi> the laſt commanded by one of their country; they poſſeſs one part of the city, and are ſeparated from the other inhabitants by a ſingle wall.</p>
               <p>ABOUT the year 1660, the famous <hi>Corſair Coxinga</hi> came up the river with three thouſand ſail of ſhips, and laid ſiege to the place. It happened that on his birth day, his army paſt the day with carouſals, and all ſorts of feſtivity. The garriſon, gueſſing that they ſhould find the enemy buried in ſleep, ſallied out, ſurpriſed the camp, ſlew multitudes, and forced the reſt to find ſecurity in their ſhips. <hi>Coxinga</hi> afterwards fought and defeated the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> fleet, and by his cruelty in cutting off the noſes of four thouſand priſoners, ſullied his victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0792500103:156"/>THE paſſage over the <hi>Kyang</hi> from <hi>Nanquin,</hi> was in the time of <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> on a bridge compoſed of fourteen pontoons. The pretty town of <hi>Jejenjeen</hi> is on the oppoſite ſide.
<note place="margin">YANG-CHOO.</note> He entered ſoon after on the imperial canal, and paſſed by <hi>Yang-choo,</hi> a great and populous city, in Lat. 32° 25′, flouriſhing by its being the ſtaple of the ſalt trade; that uſeful article, made on the ſea-ſhores, is brought here by the leſſer canals, and by the ſame means tranſported to moſt parts of the empire; for they extend in many directions weſtward, even to the borders of <hi>Tartary.</hi> The canal is continued northward on the ſide of the great lake <hi>Kao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeou-hoo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SINGULAR VESSELS.</note> the ſame which Mr. <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> calls <hi>Piexe.</hi> Here the forms of the veſſels are very ſingular; they are called <hi>Longſchon</hi> or ſerpentine, and are uſed to carry fiſh, quite to <hi>Peking.</hi> Theſe are repreſented in form of a ſerpent; from the prow iſſues the head, on which is placed an idol, with ſome live ducks pendent; from the ſtern is ſuſpended a boy, who is playing all ſorts of monkey tricks. The maſts are decorated with numbers of flags, and ſerpents appear cut or painted in every part. It is manned with rowers, who with their broad oars, not unlike paddles, go with moſt aſtoniſhing celerity. It is incredible with what expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition fiſh are conveyed freſh to <hi>Peking,</hi> even from diſtances of ſix hundred miles.</p>
               <p>THE city of <hi>Yang-choo</hi> is infamous for its traffic in women.
<note place="margin">TRADE IN WOMEN.</note> It produces the moſt beautiful in all <hi>China,</hi> particularly for the admirable ſmallneſs of their feet, and the ſymmetry of their bodies.

The whole country may have been gained from the watery element, yet it muſt have been many ages paſt, for a field near <hi>Hoin-gan</hi> is diſtinguiſhed by the numbers of ancient <hi>tumuli.</hi> Many of the towns appear like <hi>Venice,</hi> built in the water, and ſome even below.</p>

<note place="margin">FINE PAGODA.</note> but for the great beauty of the workmanſhip. It is rather low, and ſquare, of a vaſt ſize, and incloſed within a moſt extenſive wall made of ſtone, and the upper part of red and green tiles. The temple itſelf is of ſtones, mixed with yellow tiles (the imperial color) ſo reſplendent as to appear like gold when ſhone upon by the ſun; it is beſides richly decorated with dragons and various <hi>Chineſe Chimerae;</hi> the inſide filled with monſtrous idols. On the back part is a garden, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful as that of paradiſe, enriched with variety of fruits and flowers.</p>

                  <hi>Single</hi> and <hi>Tien-ſing-foo</hi> are the next cities.
<note place="margin">SINGLE AND TIEN-SING-FOO.</note> The laſt is ſeated Lat. 39° 10′, on the conflux of three great rivers. On an iſland formed at that ſpot is a moſt ſingular caſtle, of a triangular form, truncated at the top; this is the greateſt emporium in all <hi>China,</hi> and ſtrongly fortified in the manner of the country; the reſort of jonks, and all ſorts of ſhipping, are incredible, it being a port free from tribute. The city is not large, but the ſuburbs ſo extenſive as to make it one of the moſt populous in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0792500103:160"/>and are filled with palaces and pagodas. <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> imagines this city to have been the <hi>Quinſay</hi> of <hi>Marco Polo</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Bergeron's Coll. p. 116.</note> which he ſays "was like <hi>Venice</hi> built on a moraſs." The emperor, he informs us, had a magnificent palace here; and adds, that no leſs than ſix hundred thouſand families were to be found in this vaſt place. What is ſingular, the <hi>Neſlorians</hi> had a church in the city; a proof that Chriſtianity was tolerated in this empire in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century.</p>

The reaſon aſſigned for its not being brought to the walls of the city is, that multitudes of the poor entirely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by the carriage of goods and the neceſſaries of life into the capital. At this place the <hi>Dutch</hi> embaſſadors were met by a magnificent cavalcade of mandarines and people of rank, ſent by the emperor to do them honor; and they entered the city in a moſt pompous proceſſion. After being treated with the utmoſt external reſpect, they were diſmiſſed without obtaining the end of their embaſſy.</p>
               <p>I SHALL not attempt the deſcription of this magnificent city, but will content myſelf with ſpeaking to the eyes by the plates of Mr. <hi>Nieuhoff,</hi> which I believe repreſent with great fidelity the various cities, pagodas, and other buildings he paſſed by; in theſe may be ſeen the different forms of houſes, and public edifices. The ſplendor of the emperor's palace, and a general view of the city, are ſhewn in the 158th page. The pagodas,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0792500103:161"/>the idols, in various other pages, and the cuſtoms and dreſſes of the inhabitants are moſt frequently exhibited. In reſpect to the gardens of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> thoſe of the private men are mentioned in the ſecond volume of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Miſcellany, and thoſe of the emperor moſt admirably deſcribed by <hi>Le Frere Attiret,</hi> painter to the reigning monarch in 1743.</p>
               <p>I NOW return to the latitude of <hi>Canton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">COASTS OF CHINA.</note> and purſue the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pography of the coaſts. By reaſon of the great rigor with which the <hi>Chineſe</hi> exerciſe their prohibition of trading in any of their ports except <hi>Canton,</hi> our knowledge of the ſhores or harbors is very confined. We ſhall have very little to ſay of an extent of between two and three thouſand miles of coaſt, following the bending of the outline; the whole of which appears ſtrangely rugged, with promontories, divided by bays, harbors, and creeks.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Ladrone</hi> iſles,
<note place="margin">LADRONE ISLES.</note> and thoſe of <hi>Lema</hi> before the bay of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> are lofty, rude, and broken; that of the <hi>Aſſes ears</hi> takes its name from two hills that aſſume the form. <hi>Piedra Biancas,</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the north, is a very high rock of a white color; both the laſt are marks to navigators.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Foo-tchien,</hi> the province adjoining to <hi>Quang-tung</hi> on the north,
<note place="margin">FOO-TCHIEN.</note> is a mountanous country, but the mountains, by the induſtry of the inhabitants, are formed into amphitheatres, with terraces, which often extend ſeveral miles in length, and a ſeries of twenty or thirty, one above the other. The account given by <hi>Du Halde</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. i. 273.</note> is ſo curious as to merit the attention of our readers. Theſe are planted with rice, which is nouriſhed by water forced
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0792500103:162"/>up to a great height, and conveyed to the different plantations in pipes of bamboo. This province is remarkable for its vaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, opulence, and population, and alſo for its amazing fertility.</p>
               <p>AMONG the vegetable productions,
<note place="margin">ORANGES.</note> it is diſtinguiſhed for its fine oranges; one is very large, and its rind quite looſe to the pulp, which has the taſte and ſmell of the muſcadine grape. This kind is candied, and ſent to all parts of the empire; another is of a deep red; and a third very ſmall. <hi>China</hi> is the native place of oranges, from whence they were communicated to the weſtern world.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Li-chi</hi> and <hi>Long-ywen</hi> are fruits peculiar to the more ſouthern parts of this empire,

                  <note place="margin">A-MWY.</note> or the port of <hi>A-mwy,</hi> is an excellent road for ſhips, in a deep bay, beneath the ſhelter of the iſle of <hi>A-mwy,</hi> in Lat. 24° 27′. The iſland is flat and moraſſy, and garriſoned by about ſix or ſeven thouſand men. Before the prohibitory edict it was much frequented by <hi>European</hi> ſhips. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> about the year 1645, made a treacherous attempt on the place; they came with five ſhips, and landed about three hundred men, who entered the town; the greater part of the inhabitants fled, but cunningly left in their houſes abundance of ſpirituous liquors; this proved the bait they intended. The <hi>Dutch</hi> intoxicated themſelves to a great degree; of this the fugitive citizens had notice; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, ſurpriſed the invaders in their ſleep, and put them all to the ſword. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> have preſerved the hiſtory in large characters, on the face of a ſmooth rock near the entrance of the harbor.</p>

               <p>THE great iſland of <hi>Formoſa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ISLE OF FORMOSA.</note> or <hi>Ta-wan</hi> as it is called by the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> lies off the coaſt of <hi>Foo-tchien,</hi> at the diſtance of about ſixty miles from the neareſt place. The length is ninety leagues, the greateſt breadth about thirty. It is of a curvated form, with the convexity facing the continent; the tropic of <hi>Cancer</hi> paſſes over it, at the diſtance of a hundred and five miles from the ſouthern end, almoſt dividing it in equal parts. It is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that notwithſtanding its proximity it was unknown to the <hi>Chineſe</hi> till the year 1430, when a eunuch of that nation, returning from the weſt, was driven there by a tempeſt. This was not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately productive of any conſequences, nor did his countrymen profit of the diſcovery before the laſt century, when, in the reign of the emperor <hi>Kang-Hi,</hi> it was invaded by the famous <hi>Coxinga,</hi> who conquered at laſt the weſtern part, not for the empire of <hi>China,</hi> but for himſelf. At that time the kings of <hi>Quang-tung</hi> and <hi>Foo-tchien</hi> had revolted from the empire. As ſoon as their rebellion was quelled, <hi>Kang-hi,</hi> in 1683, was put in poſſeſſion of as much of <hi>Formoſa</hi> as the young deſcendant of <hi>Coxinga</hi> had power to yield.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Japaneſe</hi> ſeized on this iſland about the year 1620. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> in their way from <hi>Japan,</hi> about the year 1633 made here a ſettlement. The manner of obtaining it, and their future
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0792500103:164"/>expulſion, has been given at p. 122 of this volume, in my account of their firſt commerce in theſe parts with the empire of <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE coaſts of <hi>Formoſa</hi> are rude,
<note place="margin">PORT OF TA-WAN.</note> lofty, and rocky. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal port is that of <hi>Ta-wan,</hi> the ſame with that which the <hi>Dutch</hi> took poſſeſſion of. Near it is the capital city of the ſame name; unfortified, but garriſoned by ten thouſand <hi>Tartars,</hi> and very populous, to which the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> who are a commercial people, carry on a prodigious trade. There are beſides three other cities and ſeveral villages, all inhabited by <hi>Chineſe.</hi> The whole is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fertile, productive of grain, and all the fruits which the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent parts of <hi>China</hi> afford. As the whole of the iſland was inhabited by a barbarous people, domeſtic animals are in ſome degree ſcarce. Oxen are in uſe for riding inſtead of horſes; ſtags abound; and among the wild animals, monkies; but it does not appear that tygers or beaſts of prey are known in any part of <hi>Formoſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE iſland is divided from north to ſouth by chains of lofty and inacceſſible mountains.
<note place="margin">NATIVES OF FORMOSA.</note> The greater part of the weſtern ſide is inhabited by <hi>Chineſe,</hi> the natives have the eaſtern entirely to themſelves; thoſe which continue on the weſtern are not better than ſervants to the coloniſts, except the inhabitants of three out of the twelve diſtricts formed by the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> which have revolted. The <hi>Formoſans</hi> are a fine people, and of remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſwiftneſs, which they attain by practice, ſo that they can outrun a horſe at full ſpeed. Their ſhape is eaſy and ſlender, their complexions olive, and their hair fleck, and hanging over their ſhoulders. In the ſouthern part of the iſle they wear a linen wrapped round the middle, and falling to the knees: in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0792500103:165"/>the northern, the ſkin of a ſtag made into a ſleeveleſs jacket. Their bonnet is formed of <hi>Banana</hi> leaves, adorned with tufts of the feathers of cocks or pheaſants.</p>
               <p>THEIR morals have been much miſrepreſented by the <hi>Chineſe</hi> and the Jeſuits. They have no external worſhip, but a ſtrong notion of a Supreme Being, which renders them a quiet, honeſt, and benevolent race. An inveterate hatred ſubſiſts between them and the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> The laſt had reaſon to ſuppoſe that the iſland had its gold mines; but as they could not diſcover them in their part, they equipped a ſhip, and ſailed to the eaſtern. They were received by the natives in the moſt humane manner, invited on ſhore, and furniſhed with every neceſſary. In this viſit the <hi>Chineſe</hi> obſerved in the poor cottages a few ingots of gold left negligently, as if of no value. This excited their avarice; they made their hoſts drunk, and in their ſleep cut all their throats, and carried away the gold, the incitement to this horrid action.</p>
               <p>IT muſt not be forgotten,
<note place="margin">OF PSALMANA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZAR.</note> that the hiſtory of <hi>Formoſa</hi> was written by a perſon who pretended to be a <hi>Japaneſe</hi> converted to chriſtianity, and to have fled from his country to avoid the dreadful puniſhment inflicted by the emperor on all proſelytes. He aſſumed the name of <hi>Pſalmanazar,</hi> and is generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been born in the ſouth of <hi>France.</hi> He was a man of uncommon abilities. After leading a vagabond life through various parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> in which he acted the part of a moſt conſummate impoſtor, and ſuffering frequently the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery from his profligate life, he was reduced to become a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldier in a <hi>Scotch</hi> regiment at <hi>Sluys;</hi> there he firſt aſſumed the character of the <hi>Japaneſe. Innes,</hi> a worthleſs chaplain of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0792500103:166"/>the corps, undertook his converſion, not through principle, but the hopes of promotion on his arrival in <hi>England. Innes</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him to be an impoſtor, but for their joint intereſt they united in the deceit. <hi>Pſalmanazar</hi> formed a <hi>Formoſan</hi> alphabet; he pretended to be converted in form, was baptized by <hi>Innes</hi> by the name of <hi>George,</hi> and the credulous governor of <hi>Sluys</hi> ſtood godfather. <hi>Innes</hi> had, by his correſpondence with the good <hi>Compton,</hi> the biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> been encouraged to bring him to our capital. The prelate was made moſt completely the dupe of theſe villains. <hi>Pſalmanazar</hi> had many patrons and many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, but his abilities and impudence baffled all detection. He undertook a hiſtory of <hi>Formoſa</hi> (which he pretended was ſubject to <hi>Japan</hi>), a moſt fabulous compoſition; yet, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are always delighted with the marvellous, it was ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily bought up as to induce him to prepare a ſecond edition. <hi>Innes</hi> attained his end, got preferment, and then baſely deſerted the cauſe of his promotion. <hi>Pſalmanazar</hi> lived ſome time by various tricks and impoſtures. At length, at the age of thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eight, he began to feel compunction at the infamy of his life, and was ſtruck with moſt ſincere remorſe. He became a moſt lively penitent, and applied his great abilities to uſeful learning. He wrote his own life, which was not to be publiſhed till after his death. I believe it to be a true narrative, and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed nothing but his real name and the place of his birth, fearing to leave reproach upon his family. The liſt of his works, many of which are on important ſubjects, may be found in the <hi>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. xxxv. p. 13.</note>. He lived till <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1763, when he died
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0792500103:167"/>at the age of eighty; having long led an exemplary life, fully atoning for the irregularity of his early career.</p>
               <p>THE iſles of <hi>Pong-ho</hi> form an <hi>Archipelago</hi> off the weſtern coaſt of <hi>Formoſa,</hi> having the tropic paſſing over them.
<note place="margin">ISLES OF PONO-HO.</note> They are deſtitute of all the neceſſaries of life, even to fuel, ſo that every thing muſt be brought from <hi>Formoſa</hi> to ſupply the <hi>Chineſe</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. They conſiſt of only rocks or ſand; yet, as they poſſeſs a fine port (which <hi>Formoſa</hi> is deſtitute of), they become eſſential in the preſervation of that great iſland. The <hi>Dutch</hi> built a fort at the entrance of the harbor, of which nothing except the name remains. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> remember it by that of the fort of the <hi>Red hairs.</hi> It was the famous <hi>Coxinga</hi> who took theſe iſlands from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and kept them for his own uſe.</p>
               <p>THE province of <hi>Tche-Tchiang</hi> continues the maritime parts of <hi>China</hi> from <hi>Foo-tchien.</hi> This, like the reſt,

I will not diſpute the learned Jeſuit's ſkill in chronology; but the emperor began his reign in 2237 before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and reigned a hundred years; the period in which he was born could not therefore have been long after the univerſal deluge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Le Poivre</hi> alſo informs us, that theſe provinces were, ſome thouſand years ago, covered with water, and regained from the ſea by the induſtry of the inhabitants.

The waters of one canal not being on a level with that of another, the boat, by means of two capſtans, is hoiſted upon a ſtone glacis, or ſlope, which being made ſlippery with water, the boat glides down into the ſecond canal, as ſwift as an arrow out of a bow. For this reaſon, they are made in form of <hi>Gondolas,</hi> with keels of a wood hard enough to ſuſtain the weight of a bark.

                  <q>The next thing remarkable (ſays the accurate hiſtorian) is the <hi>Kin-yu</hi> or golden fiſh; theſe are kept, either in little ponds, made for that purpoſe, wherewith the houſes of pleaſure belonging to the princes and great lords are embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, or elſe in baſins, that commonly adorn the courts of their houſes; in theſe baſins, which are more deep than wide, they put the leaſt that can be found; for the ſmaller they are, they think them the more beautiful; beſides, the greater number may be kept of them, and they afford more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE prettieſt of them are of a curious red, ſpeckled as it were with gold duſt, eſpecially towards the tail, which is forked with two or three points; ſome are of a ſilver color, others white, and ſome ſpotted with red; both ſorts are extraordinary lively and active, delighting to play on the ſurface of the water; but then their ſmallneſs renders them ſo tender, that the leaſt impreſſion of air, and even any violent ſhaking of the veſſel, will kill great numbers of them. Thoſe that are bred in ponds are of various ſizes; ſome are bigger than our largeſt pilchards; they teach them to riſe up to the top of the water at the noiſe of a clapper, which the perſon uſes who feeds them. What is moſt ſurpriſing is, that according to all accounts, the beſt way to preſerve them is to give them
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0792500103:172"/>nothing in winter; it is certain they do not feed them for three or four months at <hi>Peking,</hi> while the very cold weather laſts; what they live on in the mean time, under the ice, it is not eaſy to underſtand, except we ſuppoſe, either that they find little worms in the roots of herbs, which grow at the bottom of the ponds, or elſe, that pieces of roots them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being ſoftened by the water, become proper food for them; but thoſe which, to prevent their being frozen, are taken into the houſes, and kept all winter in a chamber, often ſhut up in a china veſſel, without being fed at all, are towards ſpring put into the baſins again, where they ſport with the ſame ſtrength and agility as they did the year before. One would imagine they knew their maſters, and thoſe who carry them food, by their being ſo ready to riſe at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. The greateſt lords themſelves delight in feeding them with their own hands, and ſpend ſome time to obſerve their nimble motions, and ſporting in the water.</q>

               <p>THE approach to <hi>Nanquin</hi> is now very difficult, the channel being obſtructed by ſand, ſo that the greater ſhips cannot enter.

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. i. p. 104.</note> gives an account of its hiſtory, but leaves us in the dark as to the ſpecies of inſect which yielded this kind of ſilk.

<note place="margin">PROVINCE OF PE-CHE-LI.</note> from <hi>Ten-choo-foo,</hi> retires far towards the ſouth, then returns northward, and in Lat. 38° 12′ begins the province of <hi>Pe-che-li,</hi> which in Lat. 39° takes a north-caſtern direction, and on the gulph finiſhes this great empire, in Lat. 40°.

               <p>THE empire ends about 150 miles farther, in Lat. 40° 45′.
<note place="margin">GREAT WALL.</note> Here begins the celebrated wall, completed two hundred and twenty-one years before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the emperor <hi>Tſing-chi-whung,</hi> to protect the northern parts of <hi>China</hi> from the incurſions of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> It appears firſt in the very ſea, on a vaſt bulwark, founded on a number of ſhips, ſunk by a wonderful weight of huge ſtones, to render immoveable the terminating ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure. The wall is all the way from twenty to twenty-five feet high, generally caſed with brick, and terraſſed at top of a breadth ſufficient for five or ſix horſemen to ride a-breaſt. It paſſes along the frontiers of the provinces of <hi>Pe-che-li, Shan-ſi,</hi> and <hi>Shen-ſi;</hi> is guarded by a ſeries of ſquare towers or forts, at proper intervals, of only two bow-ſhots aſunder; and has its gates often of a vaſt ſize, with rooms adjacent, fitted up as <hi>places d'armes,</hi> and peculiarly well garriſoned. At no great diſtance, in ſeveral cities, general officers are poſted with conſiderable bodies of troops. The generaliſſimo reſides at <hi>Kan-choo.</hi> Many of theſe cities are the magazines for the articles of commerce brought from different parts to be tranſported into the various provinces of the empire.</p>
               <p>THIS great protection of <hi>China</hi> is not uniformly built of the ſame materials. In ſome places the walls, and even the forts, are of earth. In the diſtrict of <hi>Ning-hya,</hi> a few leagues from the city of the ſame name, the mountains are ſo high and precipitous as to ſupply the neceſſity of a wall for the ſpace of ten leagues. In other places it is carried along vaſt and rugged mountains, almoſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0792500103:176"/>inacceſſible, yet the fears of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> urged them to prolong their defence even over the ſides or ſummits of theſe alps, which direct its courſe, according to the nature of the country, over deep vallies or level plains. In a certain tract a great trench is cut to ſupply the place of the wall; and on the banks of the fierce river <hi>Whang-ho,</hi> or the yellow, are ſeries of ſentry-boxes, filled with ſoldiers, who keep watch night and day. As the wall muſt in its courſe paſs over various great rivers, arches or bridges, of a ſtupendous height and ſtrength, are thrown over them.</p>
               <p>Later emperors,
<note place="margin">SECOND WALL.</note> to give greater ſecurity to their capital, have built a ſecond wall, at ſome diſtance from <hi>Peking,</hi> as ſtrong as the firſt: It is called the great inner wall, and unites with the other by <hi>Wen-wha-fu.</hi> Near it is a city which riſes and falls with the form of the mountain it is built on, and amazes the ſpectators with the boldneſs of the ſtructure.</p>
               <p>THE length of the wall, in a ſtrait line, is ſeven or eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles, and allowing for the windings, for the aſcents over the craggy mountains, or deſcent into the deep vallies, may be eſtimated at double that length. Yet what may juſtly excite our admiration is, that this ſtupendous work was ſaid to have been completed in the ſpace of five years. In this empire of obedience every power was exerted to perform the commands of their common father, iſſued forth for the common ſecurity.</p>
               <p>IMMEDIATELY beyond this bulwark begins the country of the antient <hi>Liau-tong,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LIAU-TONG.</note> or part of that of the <hi>Manchew Tartars,</hi> the laſt conquerors of <hi>China,</hi> and who gave the preſent imperial family to the throne. The gulph of <hi>Liau-tong</hi> runs deeply into the north of the country from the foot of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> wall. This
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0792500103:177"/>territory has alſo its guard, but no better than a precinct of paliſadoes with a few mean gates. The capital <hi>Mugden,</hi> which the <hi>Manchews</hi> look on as their metropolis, has a <hi>Tartarian</hi> commander in chief, and is inhabited by multitudes of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> who carry on the trade of <hi>Tartary.</hi> Juſt without the gates are the magnificent tombs of their antient princes. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, made of cotton, is a great manufacture of this country, its principal uſe is for the ſaſh windows of the palaces and houſes of men of rank in <hi>Peking;</hi> thoſe of glaſs have not reached even the cold latitude of ſo ſplendid a people.

                  <hi>Ging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeng,</hi> the celebrated medicinal plant of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> is found in this country, and many parts of <hi>Chineſe Tartary,</hi> of <hi>Korea,</hi> and even in the provinces of <hi>Shan-ſi</hi> and <hi>Ho-nan,</hi> in <hi>China</hi> itſelf; but the latter is of an inferior kind.

<q>it is ſold for nearly its weight in gold.</q>

They have been conquered by the <hi>Chineſe, Japaneſe,</hi> and <hi>Tartars;</hi> ſince the conqueſt of <hi>China</hi> by the latter, their yoke has been light; they only are obliged to ſend four ambaſſadors to <hi>Peking</hi> annually, to perform homage, where, after their audience from the emperor, they remain in a ſtate of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till their return. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> fear that ſome time or other they may unite with the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> who have advanced far towards the <hi>Chineſe</hi> frontiers; this may occaſion a revolt, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences prove fatal to the repoſe of the empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Korea</hi> had its wall to the north-weſt, which has long ſince been in a ruinous ſtate; but even when complete, did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the conqueſt of the country by the <hi>Manchew Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Korea</hi> is mountainous, and not very fertile, except the vales. It is full of woods, and produces moſt of the European fruits and foreſt-trees. The ſouthern part yields rice and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent grain. It breeds a hardy race of horſes, excluſive of a ſmall variety not three feet high; alſo cows, and black ſwine; abounds with various animals; among others are numbers of tigers, the ſkins of which are a conſiderable article of commerce in their intercourſe with <hi>Japan.</hi> Among the noxious reptiles are cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles of an enormous ſize.</p>
               <p>THEY have great quantities of feathered game, and a variety of birds; poſſibly many of thoſe we have deſcribed in the <hi>Arctic Zoology,</hi> as belonging to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> or <hi>Siberian</hi> world. But the ſpecies of the pheaſant kind, with feathers of the tail three feet long, are confined to this country. The feathers are ſent
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0792500103:181"/>from <hi>Korea</hi> an article of commerce to various parts of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> empire.</p>
               <p>THE natives of the northern part are a fine race of men, tall,
<note place="margin">NATIVES.</note> robuſt, active, and without any of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> aſpect. Thoſe of the ſouthern part reſemble the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> of a ſallow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and tender conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>THEIR government is regular,
<note place="margin">GOVERNMENT.</note> and its cuſtoms and laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe of the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> This makes it likely that their origin may more ſafely be derived from <hi>China</hi> than <hi>Tartary.</hi> The <hi>Chineſe</hi> pretend that they were ſubdued as early as the reign of <hi>Yau,</hi> eighth emperor from <hi>Fo-hi,</hi> which may well account, if true, for the ſimilitude of laws and cuſtoms. Their rulers are abſolute and ſole maſters of the land, which is granted to every man according to his family; but the perſonal eſtate deſcends from father to ſon. Their religion is that of <hi>Fo,</hi> with all its ſuperſtitions; they are very fond of literature, and have triennial examination of Doctors, Bachelors, and Maſters of arts. Theſe adopt the pure doctrine of <hi>Confucius,</hi> and deſpiſe the ridiculous idolatry of <hi>Fo.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Koreans</hi> of rank are very ſplendid in their habits, wear fur caps and brocade cloaths; and affect purple-colored ſilk richly ornamented with gold and ſilver. Furs are much in uſe. The learned are diſtinguiſhed by two feathers in their caps.</p>

They import beſides great quantities of gold and ſilver in ingots, and part in <hi>Spaniſh Piſtoles,</hi> and carry back prodigious cargoes of raw and fine ſilk, which they manufacture at home; thin ſilks, the kind called by the <hi>Chineſe, Kao-li-Toanza,</hi> or <hi>Korean</hi> damaſk; tea, vaſt quantities of cotton, china ware, and white copper veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of all ſorts.</p>

Their trade with the nations to the north, and north-weſt, and probably with the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> of their <hi>Aſiatic</hi> dominions, comes under the ſame deſcription; all this is ſtrictly prohibited by the <hi>Chineſe</hi> emperor; who even keeps a Mandarine at the <hi>Korean</hi> court, to take care that the order be obſerved; this precaution, with ſo corrupt a nation, has very little effect.</p>

                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0792500103:183"/>THE intercourſe to the north,
<note place="margin">RUSSIANS.</note> is the moſt dreaded by the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> have made great advances on that ſide, and had formed ſettlements on the <hi>Amur,</hi> which runs through the northern part of the empire. This brought on more than one war. The <hi>Koreans</hi> are ſaid either to navigate the river <hi>Songor,</hi> or the <hi>Schingal,</hi> till they arrive in the <hi>Amur;</hi> or to ſail along the coaſt, and proceed directly up its mouth, and trade either with the ſubjects of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> or poſſibly with the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> themſelves. All the intervening track from <hi>Korea</hi> is affectedly given wrong by the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> in order to keep both their own ſubjects and thoſe of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> in ignorance; but in vain; the <hi>Koreans</hi> are a match for them in cunning. They pretend in their voyage up the <hi>Amur</hi> that they come from ſome diſtant iſle. <hi>Yſbrande Ides</hi> informs us of this, but without knowing that they impoſed on him. They trade even with the <hi>Manchew Tartars,</hi> ſubjects of the emperor; but theſe people, for gains ſake, content themſelves with the deception. From them, and from the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> or <hi>Ruſſian</hi> ſubjects, they procure the quantities of furs which they pretend are the produce of their own country.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Koreans,</hi> having their country three parts ſurrounded by the ſea, muſt naturally be a naval people; they trade com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly with <hi>Japan,</hi> and obtain the articles of commerce of thoſe iſlands.
<note place="margin">WITH JAPAN.</note> The <hi>Japaneſe</hi> have ceded the little intermediate iſle of <hi>Suſima,</hi> the <hi>Tuitatao</hi> of the <hi>Koreans,</hi> on purpoſe to facilitate the trade.</p>
               <p>By the pretence of ſailing to the iſland of <hi>Quel-praet,</hi> ſeated to the ſouth of the peninſula, to take in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> manufacture

               <p>LET me here introduce ſome account of the celebrated drug,
<note place="margin">OF RHUBARB.</note> the Rhubarb, of which <hi>Tartary</hi> and <hi>China</hi> is the ſeat. The rhubarb of all the medicinal kinds is found in great abundance in ſeveral parts of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> dominions, and even in <hi>China</hi> itſelf. In the province of <hi>Se-chwen,</hi> in the mountains of <hi>Snow,</hi> in <hi>Shen-ſi,</hi> where troops of camels are loaden with nets full of rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb in the months of <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November:</hi> it abounds alſo in <hi>Tanguth</hi> about the lake <hi>Koko-nor, Little Bucharia,</hi> and all the chain of hills from lake <hi>Baikal</hi> weſtward. It grows ſouth as far as <hi>Quang-tung;</hi> but the ſouthern rhubarb is little eſteemed, yet much of it comes to <hi>Europe</hi> by ſea; I may add, that out of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> empire it is found in <hi>Thibet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>RHUBARB was known to <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> who lived in the reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> as a valuable purge; and <hi>Paulus Aeginetus,</hi> a phyſician of the ſeventh century, preſcribed it for the ſame purpoſe. It was brought from the remoteſt parts of the ancient <hi>Scythia,</hi> and the uſe was continued through all ſucceeding ages, without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of the plant to which the roots belonged. <hi>Marco Polo</hi> obſerved it on the rocky mountain near <hi>Suchur,</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Tanguth,</hi> and ſays it was ſent to all parts of the earth; for it found its way to <hi>Europe</hi> from thoſe diſtant regions even in that early time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0792500103:186"/>
                  <hi>Gerard</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 393.</note> gives a figure of the well known rhubarb of our gardens, with roundiſh criſped leaves. This he names, very properly, <hi>Rha verum antiquorum. Parkinſon</hi> gives another
<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 484, 485.</note> in his <hi>Paradiſus terreſtris,</hi> which he procured from Doctor <hi>Mathew Liſter,</hi> phyſician to <hi>Charles</hi> I. This is acknowledged, from both their accounts, to be weaker than the other kind which came from <hi>China;</hi> it is frequent in our gardens. I do not remember that the roots were ever applied to medicinal uſes, but of the tender ſhoots of the leaves, are made excellent tarts, in the early ſummer, not inferior in taſte to the codling.</p>
               <p>THE plants which produce the true rhubarb have been but lately diſcovered; the ſeeds of the <hi>Rheum Palmatum</hi> were ſent from <hi>Ruſſia</hi> by the late Doctor <hi>Mounſey,</hi> to Doctor <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> in 1763. He ſowed them in the botanical garden; they ſucceeded greatly; and he, with his uſual liberality, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated them to the curious. He drew up an account of the plant, and inſerted it, attended with moſt accurate plates, in vol. lv. p. 290, of our Phil. Tranſactions. Doctor <hi>Woodville</hi> gives alſo a good figure of the plant at p. 227 of his medicinal botany; as to that referred to by <hi>Linnaeus (Le Brun</hi>'s travels, i. p. 188, 189) it ſeems of ſome other ſpecies of <hi>Rheum</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">The <hi>Rheum Rhaponticum,</hi> cultivated in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> gardens. F.</note>.</p>
               <p>THAT moſt excellent character the Duke of <hi>Athol,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CULTIVATED IN SCOTLAND.</note> propagated it with great ſucceſs, not only in his garden, but on the highland mountains that ſurround his ſeat at <hi>Athol.</hi> His benevolent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of rendering common and cheap this uſeful medicine, is bleſt with the utmoſt ſucceſs. The roots which he cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated in the light ſoils, ſimilar to thoſe of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> deſerts,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0792500103:187"/>the native place, encreaſe to a vaſt ſize; ſome, when freſh, have been found to weigh fifty pounds, and to be equal in ſmell, taſte, and effect to thoſe we import at an enormous expence to our country. On being dried, they ſhrink to one quarter of their original weight. There is reaſon to ſuppoſe that the <hi>Scotch</hi> rhubarb may be ſuperior in virtue to the foreign, the laſt being gathered in all ſeaſons, as the <hi>Mongall</hi> hunters chance to paſs by. They draw up the roots indiſcriminately, pierce them at one end, ſling them on their belts, and leave them to dry on their tents without further care. In all probability the time is not remote in which the <hi>Britiſh</hi> rhubarb will ſuperſede the neceſſity of the uſe of the foreign.</p>
               <p>BUT there are other kinds which are ſaid to be equally effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious with the <hi>Rheum Palmatum,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Rheum Rhabar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum</hi> of <hi>Linnaeus,</hi> the <hi>Undulatum</hi> of the <hi>Hortus Kewenſis,</hi> with long waved leaves; the <hi>Rheum Compactum,</hi> a third ſpecies, boaſts of the ſame virtues; <hi>Miller</hi> had the ſeeds ſent to him as thoſe of the true kind. The <hi>Rheum Rhaponticum</hi> is beſides met with in <hi>Tartary</hi> about lake <hi>Baikal,</hi> as well as moſt of the others. This is the ſpecies which gave the name of <hi>Rhubarb</hi> or rather <hi>Rhabarb</hi> to this drug, the plant being firſt obſerved near to the banks of the ancient <hi>Rha,</hi> or river <hi>Volga;</hi> the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Paulus Aeginatus</hi> as one of the ingredients for a purge, under the name of <hi>Rheum Ponticum;</hi> perhaps the trivial might be derived from its being brought from ſome part of <hi>Pontus,</hi> to which it was carried from its place of growth. <hi>Pliny</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. xxvii. c. 12.</note> mentions a plant with a medicinal root called <hi>Rhacoma;</hi> he ſays it came
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0792500103:188"/>from the countries beyond the kingdom of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and by the name, probably from the <hi>Rha.</hi> He deſcribes its uſes, but none of them are ſimilar to that of the rhubarb; I cannot therefore venture to ſay that it is the ſame plant.</p>
               <p>IN <hi>Chineſe Tartary</hi> the <hi>Bobak Marmots,</hi> (Hiſt. Quad. ii. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 324) are ſaid to be the propagators of Rhubarb. Wherever ten or twenty plants grow you are ſure of ſinding ſeveral burrows under the ſhades of their broad ſpreading leaves. It is probable the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure they depoſit about the roots contributes not a little to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; and their caſting up the earth makes it ſhoot out young buds and multiply. It appears that the <hi>Mongalls</hi> never accounted it worth cultivating; but that the world is obliged to the <hi>Marmots</hi> for the quantities ſcattered, at random, in many diſtricts of this country. For whatever part of the ripe ſeed happens to be blown among the thick graſs, can very ſeldom reach the ground but muſt there wither and die; whereas, ſhould it fall among the looſe earth thrown up by thoſe animals, it immediately takes root, and produces a new plant.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Chineſe</hi> call rhubarb <hi>Tay-whang;</hi> they uſe it nearly in the ſame manner as is done in <hi>Europe;</hi> eſteem its virtues much as we do, except that which comes from <hi>Canton:</hi> the greateſt part of the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> or moſt valuable, is engroſſed by the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> who purchaſe it at their town of <hi>Kiachta</hi> (a little ſouth of lake <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kal)</hi> from <hi>Bucharian</hi> merchants, and ſend it to <hi>Peterſburgh.</hi> This is called the <hi>Turkey Rhubarb,</hi> becauſe formerly it was brought from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the merchants there receiving it from the <hi>Bucharians,</hi> who now find a readier market near home. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> prohibit the exportation of the beſt rhubarb under
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0792500103:189"/>ſevere penalties, but much of it is procured, either by concealing it mixed with roots of inferior quality, or by a contraband trade. The <hi>Ruſſian</hi> government is very attentive to the buſineſs, and appoints at <hi>Kiachta</hi> perſons to inſpect the drug, and to reject all that is bad.</p>
               <p>ALL this extenſive tract has a moſt elevated ſituation,

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0792500103:192"/>walls, of no better materials than of mud; but his palace called <hi>Wangan,</hi> was of great magnificence. <hi>Rubriquis</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 106 and 95.</note> gives a full account of it to his maſter. He informs us that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the <hi>Goldſmith</hi> was employed in the ornamental work. The famous ſilver tree in one of the courts was in a fine taſte.
<note place="margin">SILVER TREE.</note> At the foot of the tree were four lions, the ſame number of gilt ſerpents twined round the ſtem, and their heads appeared out of the branches pointing different ways, ſpouting various liquors, one of wine, another of <hi>Caracoſmos,</hi> or the liquor of mares milk; the third made of honey; the fourth of rice; and each fell into a great ſilver ciſtern placed beneath. On the ſummit of the tree was an angel with a trumpet, which ſounded by the help of a pipe blown by a man artificially concealed. All this ſhewed taſte in the <hi>Khan,</hi> as well as beauty of deſign in the artiſt. This city, placed in the middle of the deſert, on a ſalient chain of mountains, might well aſtoniſh the traveller with its population, and the ſplendor of its palaces. Theſe parts of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> were about that period full of opulent cities, but little more than the ſite of them, or of <hi>Karakarin</hi> itſelf, was diſcoverable by the Jeſuits who were employed by the emperor in the vaſt work of the ſurvey of his <hi>Tartarian</hi> dominions.

               <p>THE boundaries were ſettled in 1689 by the treaty of <hi>Nert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhinſk,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TREATY OF NERTSHINSK.</note> upon the river <hi>Ingoda,</hi> in the reigns of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0792500103:195"/>afterwards ſurnamed <hi>The Great,</hi> and that of <hi>Kang-hi.</hi> The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic <hi>Ruſſians</hi> had long been endeavoring to make themſelves maſters of the important navigation of the river <hi>Amur,</hi> which in time might have given them the command of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> and <hi>Chineſe</hi> ſeas. This the <hi>Chineſe</hi> foreſaw, attacked and took a fort called <hi>Albaſin,</hi> built by the <hi>Ruſſians.</hi> They levelled it to the ground, and carried the garriſon priſoners into <hi>China.</hi> This brought on an embaſſy from the <hi>Ruſſians. Gallowin,</hi> governor of <hi>Siberia,</hi> was the embaſſador, attended by a moſt ſplendid train. <hi>So San,</hi> captain of the life guard and miniſter of ſtate, and <hi>Tong Jau-ye,</hi> maternal uncle to the emperor, were embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors on the part of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> both men of the higheſt rank, and to them were added four others of the firſt diſtinction. The cunning of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> was aſſiſted by the ſubtlety of the Jeſuits, for <hi>Kang-hi</hi> added to the negotiators Father <hi>Gerbillon</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pereyra.</hi> The <hi>Chineſe</hi> miniſters had a ſuite inferior indeed in magnificence; but what gave the greater weight to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation was, that the wiſe <hi>Kang-hi</hi> had added ten thouſand men beſides the eſcort, and which were attended by a fleet of ſeventy-ſix veſſels, each carrying a piece of artillery. The <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> had fixed on <hi>Albaſin</hi> as the place for ſettling the buſineſs; but to their ſurpriſe, the <hi>Chineſe</hi> appeared ſuddenly before <hi>Nert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhinſk,</hi> or, as they call it, <hi>Nip-chu,</hi> encamped near the place, and the whole buſineſs was tranſacted under tents. All this gave argument irreſiſtible. The treaty was concluded. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> offered to ſwear to the performance on the crucifix. <hi>Gallowin</hi> choſe that they ſhould ſwear by their own gods; and both couched the ſacred appeal in theſe terms (imprecating the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0792500103:196"/>Divine vengeance on the faithleſs party):
<q>We, embaſſadors extraordinary of the two empires, having been ſent to ſettle the bounds of both dominions, and eſtabliſh a ſolid and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual peace between both nations, which we happily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the conferences held by us in the ſeventh moon of the 28th year of <hi>Kang-hi,</hi> near the town of <hi>Nip-chu,</hi> by diſtinctly ſetting down in writing the names of the countries and places where the two empires join each other, have, by fixing the bounds of both, and ordering in what manner ſuch diſputes as may fall out for the future are to be treated of; have mutually received an authentick writing, in which is contained the treaty of peace, and have agreed that the ſaid treaty, with all its articles, ſhall be engraven on ſtone, to be fixed in the places appointed by us for the bounds of both empires, to the end that all who paſs by thoſe places may be fully informed thereof, and that this peace, with all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<note place="margin">OATH OF OBSERVANCE.</note> may be for ever inviolably obſerved. But ſhould any one have the thought only, or ſecret deſign, to tranſgreſs theſe articles of peace, or breaking his word and faith, ſhould violate them out of private intereſt, or from the deſign of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing new troubles, and rekindling the fire of war, we pray the ſupreme <hi>Lord</hi> of all things, who knows the bottom of men's hearts, not to ſuffer ſuch people to live out their days, but to puniſh them by an untimely death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I MAY here remark the obſervance of two very antient cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in the execution of this treaty;
<note place="margin">A ROMAN FORM.</note> the one in the manner of the oath, which agrees with that in uſe among the <hi>Romans,</hi> of which <hi>Polybius</hi> has leſt us the following form, made on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0792500103:197"/>and which remained in his days, cut on tables of braſs, in the temple of <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus,</hi> in the archives of the aediles.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE firſt of theſe treaties was confirmed by oath in the following manner: The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſwore by the gods of their country, and the <hi>Romans</hi> by a ſtone, agreeably to an antient cuſtom; and by <hi>Mars Enyalius.</hi> The ceremony of ſwearing by a ſtone was thus performed: the perſon that was appointed to this office, having firſt ſolemnly atteſted the publick faith for the due obſervance of the treaty, took in his hands a ſtone, and pronounced the following words—'If I ſwear truly, may the gods be propitious to me: but if I think or act any thing that is contrary to my oath, then let the reſt enjoy in ſafety their country, laws, poſſeſſions, houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold gods, and ſepulchres; and let me alone be caſt out from the ſociety, as this ſtone is now caſt away.' At the ſame time he threw away the ſtone

               </p>
               <p>THE other cuſtom was one of the earlieſt date on this very continent,
<note place="margin">COLUMNS ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORIAL.</note> that of preſerving the memory of any remarkable tranſactions by pillars of ſtone. Thus we find in <hi>Geneſis</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. xxxi. v. 51.</note>, that the treaty between <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> was confirmed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated by the erection of a pillar and a heap of ſtones. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> embaſſadors raiſed two pillars on the ſpot, to determine the boundaries of the reſpective empires, and on them engraved the treaty.</p>
               <p>IT was the intention of the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> to have made the <hi>Amur</hi> the limits of their empire.
<note place="margin">RIVER AMUR.</note> This vaſt river is formed originally
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0792500103:198"/>by the junction of the <hi>Onoa</hi> and the <hi>Schilka,</hi> to the weſt of <hi>Nert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhinſk.</hi> From thence it flows eaſterly, takes a vaſt bend ſouthernly, and then returns to the north-eaſt, and falls through a mouth four or five leagues wide into the lower part of the ſea of <hi>Ochotzk,</hi> oppoſite to the great iſland <hi>Sachalin,</hi> in Lat. 53°. The <hi>Tartars</hi> call the river <hi>Sachalin ula,</hi> or the black river; the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, Helong Kiang,</hi> or the river of the <hi>black dragon;</hi> and the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> the <hi>Amur.</hi> It was firſt known to them in 1639, by means of ſome <hi>Coſacks,</hi> ſent on an expedition towards the river <hi>Witim.</hi> According to <hi>Du Halde</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. ii. p 311.</note>, it is navigable for large barks for the ſpace of five hundred leagues.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Ruſſians</hi> were charmed with the diſcovery of a river which report made to fling up gold and ſilver; and its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood to abound with the moſt pretious ſables, cattle, fruit, and grain; and its inhabitants to be clad in nothing but damaſk and gold brocades: in ſhort, it was repreſented as a land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> The <hi>Ruſſian</hi> coloniſts of the neighboring places migrated thither in crowds, and depopulated their former country. They founded a fort in Lat. 53°,
<note place="margin">FORT ALBUSIN.</note> which they called <hi>Albaſin,</hi> the <hi>Chineſe, Jakſa,</hi> from the river near which it was ſeated. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> burnt it in 1680; but it was reſounded, and at length ſtrongly garriſoned, till it gave ſuch ſerious cauſe of jealouſy to that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to bring on the treaty which occaſioned its total demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is no wonder that they were alarmed: the borders of the river were remarkably fertile, had numbers of large cities, and a moſt populous territory; beſides, the mountains to the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0792500103:199"/>north were productive of the richeſt ſables and other furs, and inhabited by a hardy race of hunters. Had the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> rendered themſelves maſters of the <hi>Amur,</hi> even <hi>Katherine,</hi> the moderate, might have made the <hi>Chineſe</hi> tremble for the fate of <hi>Peking</hi> itſelf.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Chineſe</hi> had ſeveral places on the <hi>Argun</hi> of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, ſuch as <hi>Aigun,</hi> or, as it is called by them,

               <p>THE remainder of the north of <hi>Aſia</hi> has been deſcribed in my ARCTIC ZOOLOGY, what I have ſaid in this, ſerves to give all I can collect reſpecting that vaſt continent. The iſlands to the north of <hi>Formoſa</hi> muſt now be added, the omiſſion would render this volume incomplete, for we ſhould not only loſe the account of the important iſland of <hi>Japan,</hi> but break into the great chain, which extends quite from the firſt of the <hi>Malayan</hi> to the <hi>Kuril</hi> iſles, already deſcribed in the above work.</p>
               <p>THE iſlands, called by Mr. <hi>Arrowſmith</hi> the <hi>Tatpin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TATPIN ISLES.</note> form a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous group of ſmall iſles dependent on thoſe we are juſt going to mention; they lie not remote from the eaſtern ſide of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa,</hi> with the tropic of Cancer paſſing over the ſouthern end.</p>
               <p>THE iſles of <hi>Liquejo,</hi> or as they are called by the natives <hi>Riuku,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ISLES OF LIQUEJO.</note> are the next; they are ſeventy leagues to the north-eaſt of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa;</hi> the moſt conſiderable, <hi>Kintſchin,</hi> which lies north and ſouth, between Latitudes 26° 28′, and 25° 45′, is about fifty leagues long, and fifteen broad: the eaſt ſide and ſouth end ſkirted by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of little iſles and rocks; the inhabitants are chiefly <hi>Chineſe,</hi> who fled from the <hi>Tartars</hi> at the time of the laſt revolution. They were well received by the natives, who ſpeak a broken
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0792500103:222"/>
                  <hi>Chineſe,</hi> which argues their deſcent, ſo that the new comers were conſidered as countrymen. They are principally huſbandmen and fiſhermen, and are a moſt cheerful happy people, diverting themſelves, after the labor of the day, with a glaſs of rice beer, and with their muſical inſtruments, which they take into the field with them. A few centuries ago, theſe iſlands were conquered by a prince of <hi>Satzuma,</hi> a province of <hi>Japan,</hi> who governed them by his lieutenants; they ſtill remain in the ſame ſtate of dependence, but are taxed with much gentleneſs. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants alſo ſend annually to the emperor of <hi>China,</hi> a gift in token of loyalty and ſubmiſſion. They carry on a commerce with <hi>Satzuma,</hi> and viſit it once a year; they have there a company of merchants, but are confined in their commerce to that port, and limited to the value of their trade, but by the connivance of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> officers, they diſpoſe of an infinitely greater quantity than the law admits. They import into <hi>Satzuma</hi> all kinds of ſilks and ſtuffs, and various <hi>Chineſe</hi> commodities, which they carry over in their own jonks, and ſome of their own produce, ſuch as corn, rice, fruit, and pulſe, and a ſort of brandy made from the remainder of their crops. They bring great quantities of the <hi>Cypraeae Monetae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CYPRAEAE MONETAE.</note> or cowries, the ſame ſpecies which is found in the <hi>Maldive</hi> iſles
<note n="*" place="bottom">Outlines of the Globe, vol. i. p. 151.</note>; from thoſe ſhells is alſo prepared a white varniſh, with which the boys and girls paint their cheeks; they beſides export a ſort of large flat ſhells, which when po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, are almoſt tranſparent, and ſerve the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> for glaſs in their windows; to theſe add ſome articles of luxury, in various ſcarce flowers and plants brought in pots, and a few other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a trifling nature. Notwithſtanding theſe people are really
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0792500103:223"/>ſubject to the <hi>Japaneſe,</hi> they do not allow the emperor's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, yet, like them, they have a <hi>Dairi</hi> or hereditary eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical governor, to whom they pay great reſpect, and ſuppoſe to be lineally deſcended from the gods of their country; he reſides at the iſle called by <hi>Kaempfer</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. of <hi>Japan,</hi> p. 380.</note> (to whom we are indebted for all this account) <hi>Jajama,</hi> not remote from <hi>Oſima,</hi> an iſland of ſecond magnitude.</p>
               <p>THAT iſland, another larger, called <hi>Tanaaſima,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TANAASIMA ISLAND.</note> with ſeveral leſſer, extend north and ſouth to the north-eaſt of the <hi>Liquejo</hi> iſlands, and form the links between them and <hi>Japan.</hi> Between the iſle of <hi>Tanaaſima,</hi> and that of <hi>Liquejo,</hi> are the ſtreights of <hi>Van Diemen;</hi> that iſland is the moſt ſouthern of thoſe which compoſe the great empire of JAPAN. and is the ſmalleſt of the number; the latitude of the ſouth end is 30° north, according to Doctor <hi>Thunberg,</hi> and the moſt northerly of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> iſlands extends to 40°, the longitude from 143° to 161° eaſt. The coaſts are rude and rocky; the circumambient ſeas, raging with ſtorms during nine months of the year,
<note place="margin">STORMY.</note> are ſhallow, filled with ſhoals and rocks, and extremely ſubject to frequent ſhipwrecks. Off this coaſt are two whirlpools, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and not leſs tremendous than thoſe of the famous <hi>Mael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrom</hi> near the <hi>Norwegian</hi> ſhores; there are frequent inſtances of ſhips being abſorbed in the vortex, and their ſhattered fragments ſlung up at the diſtance of many leagues. The poets of <hi>Japan</hi> make conſtant alluſions to theſe horrible phaenomena.</p>
               <p>THE climate of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> iſles, like that of <hi>Great Britain,</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0792500103:224"/>is very changeable, and ſubject to frequent rains, fertilizing the ground, as they do that of our iſland. Thunder is frequent, and earthquakes ſo common, as never to be minded, unleſs attended (as has been often the caſe) with dreadful conſquences.</p>
               <p>THE ſummer heat is very great,
<note place="margin">HEAT.</note> and ſcarcely tolerable, when not alleviated by the winds; it ſometimes, in <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> raiſes <hi>Fahrenheit</hi>'s thermometer to 100°. The cold on the contrary is exceſſive, and ſinks the mercury many degrees below the freezing point, eſpecially when the winds blow from the north and the eaſt; in the northern parts there are mountains ſcarcely ever free from ſnow.</p>
               <p>THE whole empire is mountanous,
<note place="margin">SOIL.</note> level meadows are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; the fields of the vallies conſiſt of a clayey ſoil, ſometimes ſandy, yet rendered fertile by the incredible induſtry of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; even the higher hills are cultivated to the very tops.</p>
               <p>IN my account of the objects of their labor,
<note place="margin">BOTANY.</note> and the botanical productions, I ſhall follow that able naturaliſt and traveller Doctor <hi>Thunberg,</hi> who viſited this empire in 1775, and even had the happineſs of making a journey to its capital <hi>Jedo;</hi> as yet we have only been favored by him with the <hi>Flora</hi> of the country
<note n="*" place="bottom">A tranſlation of his travels was publiſhed in 1795, two years after this account of <hi>Japan</hi> was compoſed. E.</note>; I ſhall not purſue the brief account of the vegetable productionsſy ſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, but claſs them as Doctor <hi>Thunberg</hi> has done, according to their uſes. Japan has been fortunate in having been viſited in 1699 by Doctor <hi>Engelbert Kaempfer,</hi> one of the ableſt naturaliſts and ſcholars of his time. His <hi>Amoenitates exoticae,</hi> and his travels into this empire, render any other eulogium ſuperfluous. He will

<note place="margin">TEA.</note> 817. <hi>Kaempfer</hi>'s Travels, i. 115. ii. appendix, 2. tab. 38, 39. The tea cultivated in <hi>Japan</hi> is the <hi>Bohea,</hi> the <hi>Tſjaa</hi> of the <hi>Japaneſe,</hi> the <hi>Theh</hi> of the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> The origin of it has its legend equal to any in the univerſe. <hi>Darma,</hi> the ſon of an <hi>Indian</hi> king, who flouriſhed about the year 519 of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> era, arrived in <hi>China</hi> to preach his doctrine to the inhabitants. It ſeems he was a ſort of pope in <hi>India,</hi> the twenty-eighth in ſucceſſion from the founder of eaſtern paganiſm. He had vowed the greateſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, particularly a perpetual watchfulneſs; nature, worn out, was obliged at length to ſubmit to the refreſhment of ſleep; on finiſhing his ſlumbers, he cut off both his eye-brows, which had dared to cloſe, and flinging them on the ground, each became a ſhrub; <hi>Darma</hi> eat ſome of the leaves, and to his great ſurpriſe, found himſelf invigorated, ſo as to undergo any labors or any watchings; he communicated the virtues to his diſciples, and tea became of univerſal uſe. It is therefore ſtyled by ſome the eye-brows of <hi>Darma;</hi> he is repreſented as a horrid ugly fellow, with vaſt eye-brows, wrapped in a great cloak, and ſtanding on a reed, on which he had been wafted from region to region.</p>
               <p>WE may be certain from this tale, that the tea plant was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of <hi>China.</hi> It is cultivated by ſowing, not in whole fields, but round the borders in rows, ſo that it may not hurt the land; good farmers manure the plants with human ordure. In ſeven
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0792500103:228"/>years time it grows to the height of a man; its few leaves, at that time are gathered, the ſhrub cut down, and the moſt plentiful harveſt is obtained from the vigorous ſhoots of the ſucceeding years.</p>
               <p>THE leaves are gathered by laborers, peculiarly brought up to the buſineſs; they muſt not be taken by handfuls, but pulled off one by one. The trees are not ſtripped entirely, for there are three gatherings in the year. The leaves are ſorted into three parcels; the fineſt, the ſmall, tender, primaeval ſhoots, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for princes and great men, and on that account called imperial. They are next prepared by drying over the fire in an iron pan, and after that rolled with the palm of the hand on a mat, in order to fold them. Public laboratories are built for the purpoſe. All the proceſſes are given at large by <hi>Kaempfer</hi>

               <p>TEA is in as univerſal uſe in <hi>Japan</hi> as in <hi>China,</hi> and taken two ways. The moſt common is ſimilar to the <hi>European,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the mode we learned from the <hi>Orientaliſts;</hi> but the manner of taking it is attended with the utmoſt ceremony. The art is called <hi>Sado</hi> and <hi>Tſianoi.</hi> We have our dancing-maſters, &amp;c. and in my time M. <hi>Veſtris</hi> gave lectures to our quality on the manner of eating gracefully their ſoup. The <hi>Japaneſe</hi> maſters are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct in the manner of behavior at tea, how they are to make it, and how they are to preſent it in a polite manner.</p>
               <p>THE qualities of tea are as much diſputed in <hi>Japan</hi> as they are in <hi>Europe;</hi> but ſuch is the charming infatuation, that the uſe is ſtill followed in defiance of thoſe who take the ſide of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretiation in the old controverſy. <hi>Kaempfer</hi> gives us an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent figure of the plant, in vol. ii. tab. 38, and of the proceſs of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0792500103:229"/>the tea-table, and all its apparatus, in tab. 39, and of the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup; nor is the repreſentation of its great founder <hi>Darma,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, with his vaſt over-hanging eye-brows.</p>

                  <hi>Arundo bambos,</hi> 54. Sp. pl. 1. p. 227. <hi>Flor. Coch.</hi> 70. I am obliged to my friend the reverend Mr. <hi>Dickinſon,</hi> for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curious account of the <hi>Arundo Bambos,</hi> "which" ſays he,
<q>grows in the woods and mountains of <hi>Japan,</hi> and produces many varieties, differing much in habit, and diſtinguiſhed by different names. Yet, amidſt all this variety, <hi>Thunberg</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that he never had the ſatisfaction of meeting with a ſingle plant of it in the flowering ſtate. This is not to be wondered at, when we are informed by <hi>Reede,</hi> Mal. v. i. p. 25. that it does not flower till it has attained the age of about ſixty years, and what is very remarkable, ſheds its leaves a month previous to the time of flowering, and immediately after having perfected its fruit, withers and dies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſmall ſlender walking canes, ſo much admired for their elegant rings, are obtained from young irregular ſuckers or ſhoots of the bambo, which ſpring from the root, after the main ſtem has been repeatedly cut down. Nature has not formed them preciſely of the figure in which we receive them. They are originally crooked and pliant, and much art is uſed, by ſuſpended weights attached to them, and the application of ſmoke, to render them ſtrait and ſtiff. It is farther neceſſary to retrench with a knife the fibres which adhere to the rings, and were intended by nature to propagate the plant, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Triticum repens</hi> (couch graſs) multiplies its offsets by ſhoots from the joints.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This ſpecies of walking ſtick is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Rotang,</hi> or true cane, not only by its ſingular protuberances, but alſo by a ſmall perforation extending through the center
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0792500103:238"/>of the whole length of it, which is common to all <hi>Bambus,</hi> and in their mature ſtate enlarges into ſpacious cavities, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this ineſtimable vegetable ſubſervient to a thouſand uſeful domeſtic purpoſes. It is only in the iſland of <hi>Japan</hi> that the <hi>Bambu</hi> is thus artificially prepared for the purpoſe of a walking cane: and conſtituting a lucrative article of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, it is counterfeited at <hi>Surat</hi> (upon the <hi>Malabar</hi> coaſt) and a ſpurious ſort made of a different wood impoſed upon the ignorant. The name of <hi>Bambu</hi> is not <hi>Indian,</hi> but was given to this plant by <hi>Europeans,</hi> as expreſſive of the violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion that comes upon committing its branches to the flames, the report of which is ſaid to equal that of the firing of guns, and is cauſed by the rarefaction of great quantities of air, which had been impriſoned in its numerous chambers. See an accurate deſcription of the <hi>Japan</hi> walking-ſtick with por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberant joints, <hi>Rumph. Amb.</hi> vol. iv. lib. 6. p. 18. ſect. the laſt. The minute perforation of the young ſhoots of the <hi>Bambu</hi> is noticed by <hi>Rheede, Hort. mal.</hi> v. 2. p. 25. ſect. 3. '<hi>Stipites qui ex radice,</hi> &amp;c.' So high a ſenſe had the <hi>Indians</hi> in antient times of the multifarious benefits and bleſſings of this vegetable, that they actually made it an object of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, particularly in the iſland of <hi>Amboina, Rumph.</hi> v. iv. p. 18. ſect. 3. <hi>Ob multiplicia arundinum,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Let me add, that of the germs which ſpring from the root is made the fine pickle called <hi>Atsjaar,</hi> they are macerated in ſalt and vinegar, with leeks, and <hi>capſicum</hi> pods added.</p>

               <p>THE quadrupeds of theſe iſlands are not numerous.
<note place="margin">QUADRUPEDS.</note> The horſes are ſmall, but well ſhaped; and employed for riding, drawing, and ploughing.</p>
               <p>Cows are never uſed for the purpoſes of the dairy. The <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paneſe</hi> know nothing of milk or butter. The oxen are of a vaſt ſize, with bunches on their ſhoulders, and only uſed for the plough, or the conveyance of goods in great cities.</p>
               <p>ASSES, mules, camels, and elephants are not known here.</p>
               <p>SHEFP, goats, and ſwine are not among the native animals; the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> imported ſome, and the firſt ſtill bring a few from <hi>Batavia,</hi> for their own uſe.

               <p>MR. <hi>Zimmerman,</hi> in his zoological chart, gives the <hi>Rupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capra,</hi> or <hi>Chamois,</hi> as an animal of <hi>Japan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NO country breeds more dogs; they have maſters,
<note place="margin">DOGS;</note> but lie about the ſtreets, and are very troubleſome to paſſengers. In <hi>Kaempfer</hi>'s time there was an emperor ſo fond of theſe animals as to cauſe huts to be built,
<note place="margin">MUCH RESPECTED.</note> and proviſions to be found for them in every ſtreet; the utmoſt care was taken of them during ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and when they died, they were carried to the uſual bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-places on the tops of the mountains. This attention to the canine ſpecies at that time aroſe from its happening, that the reigning emperor was born under the ſign of the dog, one of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> conſtellations. A poor fellow who had loſt his dog by death, ſweating under his load in climbing the mountain of interment, was heard by his neighbor curſing the plaguing edict at a terrible rate. "Friend," ſaid his neighbor to him,
<q>you ſhould rather return thanks to the gods that the emperor was not born under the horſe, for what would have then been your load.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WILD dogs, with large gaping ſnouts, are among the animals of the country.</p>
               <p>THE cats are very beautiful; whitiſh,

<note place="margin">FISHES.</note> and taken not only by harpooning, as in <hi>Greenland,</hi> but alſo by nets, in which thoſe huge animals are entangled, ſo that they become a ready prey to the harpooners. Much oil is extracted from them; the fleſh is a common food. Of the tendons are made
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0792500103:252"/>ropes and cords, chiefly for packing the bales of cotton; and of the finer ſort, the ſtrings for muſical inſtruments.</p>

                  <hi>Japan</hi> is rich in minerals.
<note place="margin">GOLD.</note> Gold is found in various parts of the iſland, ſometimes in grains waſhed out of the ſand; in other places it is extracted by fuſion, from its matrix, or the ores of copper. All the mines of this metal are claimed by the emperor, and none dare work without his permiſſion; when this is obtained, two thirds of the produce are the portion of the emperor, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of the land receives one third for his expences.</p>
               <p>SILVER mines abound. Copper is the moſt common of all the metals,
<note place="margin">SILVER. COPPER.</note> and the greateſt article of commerce with the <hi>Dutch</hi> factors. All the ore is melted at <hi>Saccai</hi> or <hi>Oſacca,</hi> and there only, where it is caſt into cylinders, about a ſpan and a half long, and a finger thick. The fineſt ore is dug at <hi>Seruga,</hi> from which the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> ſeparate and refine a quantity of gold. The coin of <hi>Japan</hi> is made either of gold, ſilver, or copper;
<note place="margin">COINS.</note> thoſe of the two former are generally of an oblong ſhape, rounded at the ends, and inſcribed with letters, and the arms of the mint maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the emperor, or <hi>Dairo.</hi> The form of the coins is given by <hi>Kaempfer,</hi> i. tab. 19. and by <hi>Tavernier,</hi> part ii. p. 9. tab. 9. p. 10. tab. 10.; in the laſt, the ſilver coins are irregular at their edges. As to the copper coins, they are round, and perforated in the middle, in order to ſtring them for conveniency of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Some of the gold coins weigh an ounce and ſix drams; and of the ſilver ſeven ounces. Several of the ſilver <hi>Japaneſe</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Japaneſe</hi> ſpeak of two iſlands

The <hi>Dutch,</hi> urged by the ſame paſſion as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made two attempts to diſcover them, one in 1639, the other in 1643, but both were fruitleſs. They are ſaid to lie to the E. N. E. of the coaſts of <hi>Japan,</hi> a hundred and fifty miles diſtant. All that I can find is, that they are both put down in Mr. <hi>Arrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith</hi>'s map; one in about Lat. 30° north, under the name of <hi>Rica di oro</hi> or the <hi>gold</hi> iſland, and the other <hi>Rica di plata</hi> or the <hi>ſilver,</hi> ſtill farther north. Mr. <hi>Arrowſmith</hi> ſuppoſes it to be that ſtupendous rock called <hi>Lot's Wife,</hi> a pyramid three hundred and fifty feet high, admirably deſcribed and depicted by Mr. <hi>Meares,</hi> in p. 97 of his voyage.
<q>The Lat. ſays he, was 29° 50′ north, the Longitude 142° 23′ caſt of <hi>Greenwich.</hi> The waves broke againſt its rugged front with a fury proportioned to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe diſtance they had to roll before they were interrupted by it. It roſe almoſt perpendicular to the height, according to the tables, of near three hundred and fifty feet. A ſmall black rock appeared juſt above the water, at about forty or fifty yards from the weſtern edge. There was a cavern on
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0792500103:257"/>its ſouth eaſtern ſide, into which the waters rolled with an awful and tremendous noiſe. In regarding this ſtupendous rock, which ſtood alone in an immenſe ocean, we could not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as an object which had been able to reſiſt one of thoſe great convulſions of nature, that change the very form of thoſe parts of the globe which they are permitted to deſolate.</q>

                  <note place="margin">SULPHUR.</note> near the province of <hi>Satzuma. Kaempfer</hi> gives a curious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the place.
<q>It is, ſays he, not above a hundred years ſince they firſt ventured thither. It was thought before that time to be wholly inacceſſible, and by reaſon of the thick
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0792500103:258"/>ſmoke which was obſerved continually to ariſe from it, and of the ſeveral ſpectres, and other frightful uncommon appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, people fancied to ſee there in the night, it was believed to be a dwelling-place of devils, till at laſt a reſolute and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous man offered himſelf, and obtained leave accordingly to go and examine the ſtate and ſituation of it. He choſe fifty reſolute fellows for this expedition, who upon going on ſhore found neither hell nor devils, but a large flat ſpot of ground at the top, which was ſo thoroughly covered with ſulphur, that wherever they walked a thick ſmoke iſſued from under their feet. Ever ſince that time this iſland brings in to the prince of <hi>Satzuma</hi> about 20 cheſts of ſilver <hi>per annum,</hi> ariſing only from the ſulphur dug up there, beſides what he gets by the trees and timber growing along the ſhore.</q>

               <p>VULCANOES are to be found in many parts of the empire,
<note place="margin">VULCANOES.</note> which in general abounds with their great <hi>pabulum, ſulphur</hi> and metallic bodies.

               <p>THE empire of <hi>Japan</hi> conſiſts of three greater iſlands;
<note place="margin">NIPON.</note> the largeſt, <hi>Nipon,</hi> which gives name to the whole, is of a curvated form, and approximates at the ſouthern end to the ſouth-weſtern extremity of <hi>Korea.</hi> Between both are the ſtreights of <hi>Korea,</hi> and within is the great gulph of the ſame name, bounded on the eaſtern ſide by the concavity of <hi>Nipon.</hi> According to M. <hi>D'Anvilles</hi> ſcale, that iſland is above ſix hundred miles in length.</p>
               <p>THE next iſland is that of <hi>Sikokf,</hi> or the country of <hi>four,</hi>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Travels, p. 125, 126.</note> gives a long account of the imprudent invaſion of this iſland by the great <hi>Tartarian</hi> emperor <hi>Kublai Khan</hi> (the <hi>Siu Tſu</hi> of the <hi>Chineſe</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Du Halde, i. 214.</note>) about the year 1281, who ſent there his general, <hi>Argas,</hi> with a moſt numerous army and vaſt fleet.

               </p>
               <p>THAT country cannot properly be ſaid to have been diſcovered by the <hi>Europeans</hi> till the year 1542,
<note place="margin">DISCOVERED BY THE POR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUGUESE.</note> by three <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> named <hi>de Mota, Zeimoto,</hi> and <hi>Peixolo;</hi> theſe, as I have before mentioned, in common with the reſt of their countrymen, inſtigated by avarice, had ſailed from <hi>Malacca</hi> in ſearch of an imaginary ſpot, called the <hi>iſland of gold.</hi> Driven by a hurricane, they were wrecked on the ſhores of <hi>Japan:</hi> The lord of the diſtrict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0792500103:261"/>them with great humanity, and ſignified an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of entering into a commerce with a nation which he flattered himſelf would be ſo advantageous to him and his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>IT was at this period that <hi>Francis de Xavier,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">FRANCIS DE XAVIER,</note> the great apoſtle of the <hi>Indies,</hi> was deeply engaged in his miſſion in the peninſula of <hi>Malacca.</hi> His fame had reached <hi>Japan,</hi> when a native of the country determined to make a viſit to that part of <hi>India,</hi> to be ſatisfied of the truth of the wonders reported to have been wrought by <hi>de Xavier.</hi> He came, attended by two ſervants, was converted to Chriſtianity, and adopted the name of <hi>Paul</hi> of the <hi>Holy Faith;</hi> ſo zealous was he in his new religion, that he may truly be called the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of <hi>Japan. De Xavier</hi> determined to attend him to his native country. He aſſociated with him two Jeſuits, ſailed and landed in 1551 at <hi>Kangoxima,</hi> in the kingdom of <hi>Satzuma,</hi> on the ſouthern part of the iſland of <hi>Kiuſiu,</hi> and ſoon after paſſed to <hi>Firando,</hi> a ſmall iſland, where he, aſſiſted by <hi>Paul,</hi> made converts innumerable.
<note place="margin">INTRODUCES CHRISTIANITY.</note> His zeal then determined him to viſit the emperor, at the royal city of <hi>Miaco;</hi> he arrived at the court, and was received with much reſpect. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of proſelytes was incredible. The benevolence and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of our religion were the principal inſtruments with which the miſſionaries operated on the minds of the people, who compared the conduct of the Chriſtian preachers with that of their own <hi>Bonzees.</hi> The laſt ſuppoſe that all ſick and infirm people are the objects of the wrath of Heaven, and conſtantly leave them to periſh. The miſſionaries obſerved the precepts of our Saviour; they fed the hungry, cloathed the naked, and adminiſtered to the ſick. Theſe irreſiſtible proofs of the ſuperior
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0792500103:262"/>excellency of our doctrine, gave ſucceſs to their labours; for near a century the true religion flouriſhed, and ſpread more and more over the empire. Other circumſtances concurred to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the reception of the goſpel in <hi>Japan.</hi> The <hi>Bonzees</hi> preached the neceſſity of mediators in their <hi>Xaca</hi> and other gods; they underwent long and ſevere faſts and mortifications, and both Chriſtians and <hi>Japaneſe</hi> agreed in the worſhipping of images, in the monaſtic life, in beads, proceſſions, praying for the dead, and even auricular confeſſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were followed,
<note place="margin">JESUITS, &amp;c.</note> as occurred in <hi>China,</hi> by crowds of <hi>Dominicans, Franciſcans,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtlines</hi> to aſſiſt in the harveſt. The holy men ſoon fell into the ſame error as in that empire; they quickly began to quarrel with the Jeſuits, accuſed them of avarice, and of temporizing with the vices and ſuperſtitions of the <hi>Japaneſe.</hi> Let the reader peruſe p. 98 of this volume, and he will learn the imprudency of all theſe religious adventurers.</p>
               <p>THE vaſt profits reſulting from the commercial and worldly ſpirit of the Jeſuits, were one cauſe of the toleration which the Chriſtian religion experienced for ſo great a length of time. The emperors ſaw the wealth the <hi>Europeans</hi> brought into their country; and as long as the Chriſtians did not diſturb the peace of the government, they permitted the converſion of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the exerciſe of our religion. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſettled at firſt at the harbors of <hi>Bungo</hi> and <hi>Firando,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Nagaſaki</hi> only. They carried on immenſe trade; and in one year exported not leſs than three hundred tons of gold from <hi>Miaco,</hi> the emporium, at that time, of all their commerce in this part of the world. In the year 1636, when their trade was on
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0792500103:263"/>the decline, they even ſent from that town 2350 cheſts of ſilver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> introduced themſelves into <hi>Japan</hi> about the year 1600, eſtabliſhed their firſt factory at <hi>Firando,</hi> and obtained from the emperor a patent for a free commerce. The deep enmity between them and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſoon began to ſhew itſelf, and each nation took every poſſible means to ſupplant its rival. In the year 1636 an opportunity offered.
<note place="margin">CONSPIRACY.</note> The <hi>Dutch</hi> happened to take a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſhip, in which were found certain letters from a captain <hi>Moro</hi> to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> miniſtry at <hi>Liſbon,</hi> wherein he had laid a plan for murdering the emperor, and reducing the empire to the power of his countrymen. <hi>Moro</hi> was a <hi>Japaneſe</hi> by birth, chief of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> in <hi>Japan,</hi> and very zealous for the Chriſtian religion. The letters were carefully tranſmitted to the emperor. <hi>Moro</hi> was empaled, and burnt alive. After a little time an edict followed, which entirely baniſhed every foreigner from the empire, with the moſt rigid prohibition of their ever entering it again. A perſecution was raiſed againſt the Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">PERSECUTION.</note> perhaps the moſt horrid that ever was known; it laſted forty years, and thouſands periſhed by the moſt dreadful torments; it was computed that above a third of the people of the empire were profeſſors of Chriſtianity. The puniſhments thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creatures underwent are not to be related, the inventions of Hell itſelf muſt have been put to the ſtretch. If any one has the ſtrange curioſity of being acquainted with them, he need only turn to <hi>Ogilvy</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>Japan</hi>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0792500103:264"/>boiling water mentioned by me at p. 247 of this work, was one of the inſtruments of torture, varied and lengthened by the moſt diabolical inventions. Thoſe of <hi>Singok</hi> were the moſt horrible; they flow with vaſt violence and noiſe beneath a lofty precipice, and emit the moſt noiſome ſulphureous vapor, which riſes to a great height. Hither the Chriſtians were brought in multitudes; and in caſe they refuſed to renounce their religion, were carried bound to the ſummit of the mountain, and precipitated into the ſubjacent <hi>Phlegethon.</hi>

               <p>IN order to impreſs on every ſubject a deteſtation of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion,
<note place="margin">TREADING ON THE CRUCIFIX.</note> and poſſibly to diſcover if there be any latent favorers of its doctrine, the following annual cuſtom is preſerved throughout the empire: people of all ranks and periods of life, even to children of a certain age, are aſſembled in the different places, where they perform the ceremony of trampling upon the croſs. It was even ſaid to have been a rite exacted from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as the price of their commerce with the <hi>Japaneſe. Swift,</hi> in his voyage to <hi>Laputa,</hi> is humorous on the ſubject; for when <hi>Gulliver,</hi> under the character of a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> petitions the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to be excuſed the ceremony, his majeſty, much ſurpriſed, tells him, that he was the firſt of his countrymen who ever made any ſcruple, and that he ſuſpected he muſt be a Chriſtian, and not a <hi>Hollander.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">DUTCH.</note> In 1611 the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſent a ſolemn embaſſy to the emperor, then reſident at <hi>Miaco,</hi> and were ſaid to have at that time obtained an advantageous commercial treaty; at length they fell under the general edict of expulſion; yet even after that ſevere decree, procured re-admiſſion, under moſt mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtrictions; they virtually are compelled to renounce their
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0792500103:265"/>religion; they muſt give up their prayer-books on firſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and relinquiſh during their whole confinement every mark of Chriſtianity. But what will not a <hi>Dutchman</hi> do for gain! They make from the factory an annual journey to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's court, which they dignify with the name of embaſſy; but it is no more than a compulſory viſit to preſent their gifts: their manner of travelling, both on their way and on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, is under a ſtrict guard, more like that of a parcel of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victs, than the merchants of a great commercial nation. One ſhip only is permitted to trade with this empire annually, and that is confined to the port of <hi>Nagaſaki,</hi> in the little iſle of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima,</hi> on the weſt ſide of the iſland <hi>Kiuſiu.</hi> In fact, this is the only ſecure harbor in all the mighty empire of <hi>Japan.</hi> As ſoon as a veſſel arrives, a <hi>Japaneſe</hi> guard is put on board; the number, ſize, age, and complexion of the crew noted down; every living creature in the veſſel is to be accounted for; a monkey died, and the coroner's inqueſt ſat on the body. The next thing done is to take an exact inventory of, and to cauſe all the ſails, maſts, ropes, rudder, guns, arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and all the tackle of the ſhips, to be conveyed into the emperor's warehouſe, there to be kept under lock and ſeal till the time comes for their departure, when they are reſtored, according to the inventory taken, of which both parties have an exact duplicate

               <p>THE articles imported by the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TRADE.

Theſe conſtitute the ſum of the traffic, which on the whole is far from conſiderable, ever ſince the abolition of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0792500103:267"/>Chriſtianity in the empire. The <hi>Abbe Raynal</hi> eſtimates the whole annual commerce at little more than forty-five thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>THE firſt time that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> traded directly with <hi>Japan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ENGLISH.</note> was in 1613, when captain <hi>Saris</hi> entered the port of <hi>Firando;</hi> he met with the moſt courteous reception from the king of the iſland. <hi>Saris</hi> was charged with letters and preſents from our commercial pacific monarch <hi>James</hi> I. to his imperial majeſty of <hi>Japan.</hi> After a ſhort ſtay at <hi>Firando,</hi> he proceeded on his journey to <hi>Surunga,</hi> where the emperor at that time kept his court. A moſt honorable anſwer was returned, and privilege of trade granted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> throughout the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> empire; <hi>Saris</hi> then made a viſit to the emperor's ſon at <hi>Jedo.</hi> The hiſtory of theſe tranſactions is given by <hi>Purchas</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pilgrim, vol. i. p. 366-377.</note>, and is well worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting. <hi>Saris</hi> found at <hi>Firando, William Adams,</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who by a ſtrange chance was flung on this iſland, and detained there
<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid, p. 125-132.</note> till his death. He was of no ſmall uſe to <hi>Saris</hi> as an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter. <hi>Saris</hi> eſtabliſhed a factory at <hi>Firando,</hi> till the general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> excepted.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>French,</hi> in the time of <hi>Colbert,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">FRENCH.</note> were deſirous of partaking of the advantages of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> trade; that great miniſter propoſed ſending a number of <hi>Huguenots,</hi> who might ſafely ſwear that they were not of the ſame religion with the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe;</hi> but the jealous <hi>Japaneſe</hi> rejected the requeſt.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Chineſe</hi> had once prodigious commerce in this empire,
<note place="margin">CHINESE.</note> and came and ſettled in any numbers they pleaſed; but in time
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0792500103:268"/>the jealous <hi>Japaneſe</hi> took umbrage at the vaſt concourſe of thoſe foreigners, and at length confined them to a certain precinct, near the ſame iſland with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> They are allowed to have three ſales in the year, one in ſpring, when they are permitted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the cargoes of twenty jonks, a ſecond of thirty jonks, and a third in autumn of twenty. All above the number are obliged to return without being ſuffered to unlade.</p>
               <p>THE religion of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> is idolatry:
<note place="margin">THEIR DEITIES.</note> their deities are amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly numerous; tradition ſays that they had been men eminent for their piety or mortification, deified after death for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral virtues. They alſo hold that their earlieſt emperors were gods and demi-gods, and that during the firſt period, they were governed by ſeven great celeſtial ſpirits, each of which reigned a certain, but immenſe number of years. Their temples are very numerous, diſperſed not only over the cities, but even the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and deſerts. Their idols aſſume a thouſand extravagant forms, and coloſſal ſizes; in one of their temples is an idol of copper gilt, the very chair it ſits on is ſeventy feet high, and the head ſo large as to be capable of containing fifteen men; many of them work miracles, and bring abundance of gain to the temple or monaſtery which poſſeſſes ſuch a treaſure.</p>
               <p>A TEMPLE near <hi>Miaco</hi> takes its name from its number of idols, which amount to 33,333; Doctor <hi>Kaempfer</hi> gives us a view
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of <hi>Japan,</hi> vol. ii. tab. 36.</note> of this vaſt repoſitory, and in the following plate repreſents its celebrated idol <hi>Quenwoa,</hi> ſitting on the flower <hi>Tarate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE monaſtic life is much in vogue in <hi>Japan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MONASTIC LIFE.</note> The mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries are filled with regulars and ſeculars, like thoſe of the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0792500103:269"/>church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſome lead moſt auſtere lives; others indulge like the plump <hi>Benedictines;</hi> others are accuſed of great irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities.</p>
               <p>THERE is one order of ſingular auſterity, that of the <hi>Jamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos,</hi> i. e. the <hi>mountain ſoldiers;</hi> they in one ſenſe anſwer to our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary religious, being bound to fight for the gods and religion of their country, but never have degenerated into the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the knights of the <hi>European</hi> orders. They paſs their time amidſt the holy mountains, and practiſe the greateſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; the richer live more at their eaſe in their own houſes. This order is now divided into two ſects, one called <hi>Jofanfa,</hi> the votaries of which bind themſelves to aſcend once a year the great mountain of <hi>Fikoaſan,</hi> a journey of vaſt difficulty, by reaſon of its heights and dreadful precipices, but ſtill more tremendous on account of the penalty attending any impure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon making the attempt; he infallibly is poſſeſſed by the devil of the mountain, and becomes ſtark mad. The other ſect is named <hi>Fonſanſa;</hi> this likewiſe is obliged to make an annual pilgrimage to the ſummit of the <hi>Omine,</hi> a mountain not leſs terrible than the other; but ſhould any one preſume to aſcend it without being duly prepared by purification, he is certain of being flung down the precipices, or ſeized with a lingering illneſs, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of his neglect.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Japaneſe</hi> religion is ſplit into a multitude of ſects;
<note place="margin">VARIOUS SECTS.</note> each differ in ſome tenets, yet all agree in five indiſpenſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. 1. They are not to kill, or eat of any thing that is killed; 2. they are not to ſteal; 3. nor to lie; 4. nor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery; 5. nor to drink wine. Is it not evident that they brought with them, on the diſperſion of mankind, ſome of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0792500103:270"/>the Moſaical laws, and in the laſt that they had adopted the rite of the <hi>Rechabites?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Japan</hi> has its peculiar language,
<note place="margin">LANGUAGE.</note> different from all the <hi>Aſiatic,</hi> and probably the primitive one, brought over by the coloniſts who originally peopled the iſlands, and came directly from the banks of the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> on the diſperſion of mankind after the confuſion of languages. The <hi>Japaneſe</hi> have an opinion that the primoeval emigrants ſettled in the province of <hi>Iſje;</hi> numbers therefore make a pilgrimage annually to the antient ſpot, the place where their anceſtors dwelt, and as ſuch honor it with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar acts of devotion. At <hi>Iſje</hi> are two temples
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Kaempfer,</hi> i. tab. 17. 18.</note>; within that which they name the <hi>True Temple,</hi> nothing is to be ſeen but a looking glaſs, and bits of white paper, emblems of truth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They probably brought with them a pure Monotheiſm, which was afterwards converted into Polytheiſm, by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing with the ſeveral nations, which ſubſequently contributed to the population of <hi>Japan,</hi> becauſe it is reaſonably believed, that empire received a vaſt increaſe of inhabitants by the numerous ſhipwrecks on its ſtormy coaſts, and likewiſe by migrations from the neighboring <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Korea.</hi> Whether the vaſt reverence which the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> pay to their parents was copied from the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> or whether it might not have been introduced by the primoeval coloniſts, as a part of the firſt great code of laws, the fifth commandment, I will not pretend to determine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Japan</hi> is governed by two emperors;
<note place="margin">GOVERNMENT. SECULAR.</note> one called the <hi>Cubo,</hi> or ſecular monarch, who rules with abſolute power; all the princes and great lords of the empire pay him the moſt ſervile obedience.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0792500103:271"/>Formerly the whole was divided into ſmall independent ſtates, the rulers were ſtiled kings and princes, many of which retain the names, and govern abſolute enough; but entirely under the direction of the emperor.</p>
               <p>THE antient title of the monarch was <hi>Dairo;</hi> he was alſo ſovereign pontiff, and like the pope the ſupreme head of the church. In that character his perſon was held ſo ſacred, that little ſhort of divine worſhip was paid to him; for a long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod he governed by means of a prime miniſter, who was called the <hi>Cubo,</hi> a dignity uſually beſtowed on one of his younger ſons; the father, like other eaſtern monarchs, devoting his whole time to indolence and ſenſuality. At length a <hi>Cubo</hi> aroſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned the <hi>Dairo,</hi> or rather uſurped his more important office, that of ſecular emperor; he permitted him to retain that of pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.
<note place="margin">ECCLESIAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICAL.</note> The <hi>Cubo</hi> thus ſtripped him of all ſort of power except eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, but preſerves the farce of paying him all external reſpect, as much as if he had enjoyed the antient plenitude of authority; he renders him an imaginary homage, and pretends to act only as his deputy, and to hold the empire from him.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Dairo</hi> was permitted to reſide in the palace, in the old im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial city of <hi>Miaco,</hi> and to keep up the antient ſtate, but that is now done with difficulty, as the <hi>Cubos</hi> have ſucceſſively leſſened the revenues. Still he reigns ſupreme over the church. The people pay him the utmoſt veneration, and the <hi>Cubo</hi> himſelf is obliged to marry one of his daughters, in caſe he has any that are marriageable. The firſt <hi>Cubo</hi> who uſurped the empire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Jedo,</hi> which is the other great capital of the iſland.</p>
               <p>THE laws of <hi>Japan,</hi> as is told of thoſe of <hi>Draco,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SEVERE LAWS,</note> may be ſaid
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0792500103:272"/>to have been written in blood. <hi>Monteſquieu</hi> obſerves, that it is to ſupply the great defect of the religion of the country, in its ignorance of the doctrine of future rewards and puniſhment. Almoſt every crime is puniſhed with death,
<note place="margin">AND PUNISH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS.</note> and often attended with the moſt excruciating torments. Crucifixion is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; ſometimes the malefactor is crucified erect, ſometimes with the head down. I have little doubt but that theſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were unknown in the empire, till the propagation of Chriſtianity. The ideas were taken from the crucifixes of the Chriſtians, and from the pictures of the ſuffering of our SAVIOR. The mode in which death was inflicted on the apoſtle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> probably gave riſe to that variation of cruelty in <hi>Japan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE puniſhment for gentlemen and ſoldiers is ripping open the belly. As a peculiar favor, they are ſometimes permitted to be their own executioners. The emperor ſends his mandate; the perſon whom he ſo favors, receives it with the utmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; makes a great feaſt, and on the concluſion puts the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial order in execution, in the very preſence of his friends and family.</p>
               <p>FROM the variety of feature and form of body in the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> of the ſeveral provinces, it is evident they are deſcended from different races of people, who have migrated, or have been caſt on the coaſts at various times. "Thus," ſays <hi>Kaempfer,</hi> i. 95.
<q>although the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> in the main, particularly the common people of <hi>Nipon,</hi> be of a very ugly appearance, ſhort-ſized, ſtrong, thick-legged, tawny, with flattiſh noſes and thick eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids (though the eyes ſtand not ſo deep in the forehead as in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0792500103:273"/>the <hi>Chineſe</hi>), yet the deſcendants of the eldeſt and nobleſt families, of the princes and lords of the empire, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more majeſtick in their ſhape and countenance, being more like the <hi>Europeans.</hi> The inhabitants of the provinces <hi>Satzuma, Ooſijma,</hi> and <hi>Fiuga,</hi> are of a middle ſize, ſtrong, courageous, and manly, otherwiſe civil and polite. The ſame is obſerved of the inhabitants of ſome of the northern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in the great iſland <hi>Nipon,</hi> excepting thoſe of the great province <hi>Osju,</hi> who are ſaid to be beyond others cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful. The inhabitants of ſome provinces of <hi>Saikokf,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>Fiſen,</hi> are ſhort, ſlender, but well-ſhaped, of a good handſome appearance, and extremely polite. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the great iſland <hi>Nipon,</hi> particularly of its eaſtern provinces, are known from others by their big heads, flat noſes, and muſculous fleſhy complexion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kaempfer</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. of <hi>Japan,</hi> i. 93.</note> relates,
<note place="margin">ISLE OF BLACKS.</note> that ſome centuries ago the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the iſland of <hi>Genkaiſima,</hi> ſituate to the north of <hi>Nipon,</hi> and inhabited by <hi>Owi,</hi> or <hi>black devils;</hi> and that after extirpating them, they peopled the iſle with a colony of their own. Theſe blacks are deſcribed in the antient chronicles of <hi>Japan</hi> to have worn long hair ſpread over their ſhoulders, and to have had ſtrange houſehold goods and high-crowned hats. <hi>Kaempfer</hi> juſtly imagines them to have been <hi>Malayes</hi> wrecked on that iſland. Thoſe people are remarkable for wearing their hair of a great length; and as to the hats, they moſt probably were <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean,</hi> and among the articles imported into the <hi>Malaye</hi> iſlands, which in old times were brought over land to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and from

To their intrepidity may be added their patience under labor, their ability to undergo any hardſhips.

               <p>THEY are celebrated for the quickneſs of their apprehenſions, and facility in learning. Before the arrival of the miſſionaries, their acquired knowledge was at a low ebb. What they attained after that period may poſſibly be loſt. At that time they were very ignorant aſtronomers,

               <p>BOTANY is much ſtudied by the phyſicians of the empire, and many books are compoſed on the ſubject. Dr. <hi>Thunberg</hi> met with two phyſicians at <hi>Jedo</hi> who had great knowledge, not only in their own profeſſion, but in botany, mineralogy, and zoology.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Japaneſe</hi> are fond of good paintings,
<note place="margin">PAINTINGS.</note> and the rich will give immenſe prices for pieces of merit. As to their own artiſts they are on a level with thoſe of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> but excel us greatly in the beauty of their colors.</p>
               <p>THEIR cabinet-works,
<note place="margin">JAPAN WORKS.</note> and the ſeveral things which go under the common name of <hi>Japan,</hi> are well known for the excellency of the varniſh, which ſurpaſſes that of all the world. The black alſo is moſt intenſe, and the coloring or painting exquiſite; as to the braſs furniture of the cabinets, it is very coarſe and clumſy. But the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> excel in iron manufactures;
<note place="margin">STEEL.</note> their metal is of the beſt quality; their arms are muſkets, bows and arrows, dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſcymitars. The laſt of a moſt remarkable temper; it is cuſtomary to try the edge on the bodies of executed malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which they cut to pieces by way of experiment.</p>
               <p>WHEN I am on the ſubject of arms,

It is computed that the ſtanding army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a hundred thouſand foot and twenty thouſand horſe. In a kingdom which can have no foreign wars, nor fears inteſtine tumults, this is ſurpriſing; but ſince the conſpiracy of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi> and the extirpation of Chriſtianity, the emperors have been in conſtant fears of plots and invaſions from the <hi>European</hi> powers.</p>

                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0792500103:278"/>LET me now return to the arts.
<note place="margin">PRINTING.</note> Printing has been among them from time immemorial; like the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> they cut the letters on blocks of wood, but excel them in neatneſs; they print and write like that nation. In this art, and in ſeveral others, as well as in cuſtoms, there is ſuch an agreement that I cannot doubt but that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> were their original inſtructors in ſcience; but, as is often the caſe, the ſcholar has excelled the maſter.</p>
               <p>THEY alſo claim the invention of gunpowder,
<note place="margin">GUNPOWDER.</note> but remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the <hi>Chineſe</hi> in its uſes, not only in artillery, but in all ſpecies of fire-works.</p>
               <p>THE architecture of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> reſembles in ſome degree that of the <hi>Chineſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ARCHITECTURE.</note> it is much more plain, being not loaden with ornaments as that of <hi>China.</hi> The common houſes are ſmall, conſiſting of two ſtories; the upper of which is ſeldom inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and the reſt is almoſt deſtitute of furniture, except mats, and a ſmall table to eat on. The cedar <hi>(Juniperus virginiana)</hi> fir, and the bamboo, are the great materials for building. Their mirrors are made of metal, but never uſed but at their toilets. The windows are covered with a white paper thin enough to admit the light.</p>
               <p>THE caſtles of the nobility conſiſt of three different incloſures,
<note place="margin">CASTLES.</note> one round the other, and are defended by a deep ditch; but never by artillery: they are uſually at the ſkirts of large towns; the owners are bound to keep them in repair.</p>
               <p>THE temples are often very magnificent,
<note place="margin">TEMPLES.</note> and ſome are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly remarkable for the height of the roof, the elegance of the ſculpture, and beauty of the gilding and painting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0792500103:279"/>HERE are conſiderable manufactures of ſilk and cotton,
<note place="margin">SILK AND COTTON.</note> the produce of their own country; but the <hi>Dutch</hi> are allowed to import a great quantity of cloths, ſtuffs, chintzes and cottons.</p>
               <p>THE dreſs of the better ſort of people are ſilk, of the lower,
<note place="margin">HABITS.</note> cotton. Their habits are looſe gowns with large ſleeves. In ſummer they are thin; in winter quilted; and often they put on one or more additional, according to the ſeverity of the ſeaſon. The women's apparel reſembles the men's, only the gowns of the former are much longer, and trail on the ground; men of rank alſo wear trowſers, and ſhort black jackets placed over their gowns. They uſe ſandals, but do not wear ſtockings; and always go bare-headed, except in a journey, when they put on a conical cap of ſtraw; at other times they protect themſelves from the ſun and rain by fans and umbrellas.</p>

It lies in about Lat. 35° 40′ north, in a large plain, ſurrounded with beautiful verdant hills and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and watered by numbers of ſmall ſtreams. <hi>Miaco</hi> is the reſidence of the <hi>Dairo,</hi> or eccleſiaſtical emperor, and is full of manufactures of all kinds, being the chief mercantile town in the empire.

The city has great numbers of temples dedicated to <hi>Amida,</hi> and the various deities; the eccleſiaſtics are of courſe prodigiouſly nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. The houſes are in general ſmall and mean, and liable to frequent fires; four thouſand have been burnt by a ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.

               <p>THE naval force of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> is very ſmall,
<note place="margin">NAVY.</note> the emperors not having thought proper to maintain a fleet ſince the expulſion of foreigners, preſuming it impoſſible to have quarrels with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with whom they could have no intercourſe.
<note place="margin">SHIPPING.</note> The merchant ſhips, which are built only for conveying goods from iſland to iſland, are moſt clumſily made, and by the emperor's order, in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0792500103:281"/>ſuch a form as renders it impoſſible for them to go far to ſea. They are commonly about twenty-eight yards long, and eight broad.

                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0792500103:282"/>THE articles brought from thence are cod,

               <p>THE other country dependent on <hi>Japan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ISLE OF MATMAY.</note> is the iſland of <hi>Matmay</hi> or <hi>Matſumai,</hi> part of the land of <hi>Jeſo,</hi> divided from the north end of <hi>Nipon</hi> by an incurvated ſtreight, in the neareſt place ſixty <hi>verſts,</hi> or forty-five miles broad. According to <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levoix,</hi> in his <hi>Faſtes Chronologiques,</hi> the firſt <hi>European</hi> who viſited that iſland was father <hi>Jerom de Angelis,</hi> a <hi>Sicilian</hi> jeſuit, who went there by ſea from <hi>Japan,</hi> and landed at the capital. He reached it in the year 1620, and returned in 1621, but without being certain whether it was an iſland or part of the continent, nor has he left us any account, either of it or its inhabitants.</p>
               <p>THE next <hi>Europeans</hi> who viſited this country were the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LAND OF JESO.</note> who in 1643 ſailed from the <hi>Cape Nabo</hi> in the ſhips <hi>Caſtricom,</hi> captain <hi>De Vries,</hi> and the <hi>Breſkes,</hi> on a voyage of diſcovery off the coaſts of <hi>Tartary.</hi> In Lat. 44° 30′ north, they fell in with what they call <hi>Eſo</hi> or <hi>Jeſo.</hi> Whether this was the north extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>Matſumai,</hi> or another land almoſt contiguous to it, does not appear. By Mr. <hi>Arrowſmith</hi>'s map it ſhould ſeem that theſe diſcoverers ſailed along the eaſtern coaſt of a certain country from the moſt ſouthern part of <hi>Matſumai,</hi> as high as Lat. 49° 30′, and gave names to ſeveral bays or points of lands. As to the weſtern ſides of the region, they probably are quite undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. In the map I am ſo partial to, not only that coaſt, but thoſe of the correſponding continent are left undetermined,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0792500103:283"/>noted only with dotted lines, even as high as the ſouth end of the iſland of <hi>Sachalin.</hi> The intermediate ſpace is the ſuppoſed ſtreight of <hi>Jeſo.</hi> Whether the land of <hi>Jeſo</hi> is, as Mr. <hi>Müller</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, any more than an archipelago, or whether it is part of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> continent, at preſent remains extremely doubtful. <hi>Matſumai</hi> alone ſeems to have been proved to be an iſland.
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The voyage of the unfortunate <hi>de la Perouſe,</hi> has thrown conſiderable light on the hitherto undeſcribed land of <hi>Jeſo,</hi> and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſhore of <hi>Tartary.</hi> After coaſting for ſome time the inhoſpitable iſles of <hi>Japan,</hi> that able navigator traverſed the intervening ſea, till he came in ſight of the continent of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in Lat. 42°, which he followed in a northerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and in Lat. 45° 13′ landed at the <hi>Baie de Ternai.</hi> Here he found a country of the moſt abundant vegetation, but ſhewing no ſigns of being occupied, except by wandering hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or occaſional viſitants by ſea. Game of all kinds were ſeen in quantities, and the ſea afforded a copious ſupply of cod, herring, and falmon. In an excurſion inland, ſome of the party diſcovered a tomb, in which were depoſited two bodies clad in the ſkin of bears, <hi>Chineſe</hi> coin, and copper ornaments were attached to their girdles, and near them lay ſilver earings, an iron hatchet, a knife, a wooden ſpoon, a comb, and a ſmall bag of rice.</p>
                     <p>Still purſuing the coaſts of <hi>Chineſe Tartary,</hi> the navigators touched at a bay to which they gave the name of <hi>Suffrein,</hi> ſituated in Lat. 47° 51′; continual fogs retarded their progreſs. In Lat. 48° 35′ they diſcovered to the eaſt the apparently rocky and barren ſhores of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal land of <hi>Jeſo,</hi> part of the vaſt iſland <hi>Tehoka</hi> or <hi>Sachalin,</hi> to which they ſailed. They found the inhabitants advanced to a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of civilization in conſequence of their intercourſe with the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> parts of whoſe dreſs they had adopted, and with whom, and the <hi>Mantchew Tartars,</hi> they carried on a trade in dried fiſh and oil. Leaving theſe intelligent iſlanders, who had traced on the ſand with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt geographical accuracy the object of his farther enquiry, <hi>de la Perouſe</hi> proceeded north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and touched at a ſpot he denominated <hi>Baie d'Eſtaing;</hi> the channel between <hi>Tehoka</hi> and the continent narrowed to the diſtance of twelve leagues; the ſoundings alſo became gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually leſs, and in Lat. 51° 45′ did not exceed nine fathoms. The enterprizing ſpirit of a <hi>Cook</hi> or a <hi>Vancouver</hi> ſeemed here wanting; <hi>de la Perouſe,</hi> after a trial of a few hours, remained ſatisfied that a bank of ſand, over which boats only could paſs, connected the ſhores and cloſed the extremity of the vaſt gulf. He however draws the juſt concluſion, that the iſland called <hi>Sachalin</hi> by the <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> the northern extremity of which has long been known, extends from the 46th to the 54th degrees of latitude, and conſequently includes a portion of the <hi>Yedzo,</hi> or <hi>Jeſo</hi> of our geographers. The ſtraights which ſeparate this iſland from that of <hi>Matſumay,</hi> are aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with accuracy, and juſtly diſtinguiſhed by the name of the French navigator.—On the return of the ſhips from their fruitleſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to penetrate into the ſea of <hi>Ochotſk,</hi> they entered the <hi>Baie de Caſtries,</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>Tartary.</hi> Here was ſituated a ſmall village, inhabited by a race whoſe high cheek bones and ſmall eyes announced its origin; but it appeared only the occaſional reſidence of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent tribes for the purpoſe of fiſhing, who carry the produce of their labor to the <hi>Mant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew Tartars,</hi> living on the banks of the great river <hi>Segalien</hi> or <hi>Amur,</hi> from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in exchange for their dried ſalmon, grain, nanquin, and other articles probably brought from <hi>China.</hi> The cuſtom of leaving in their huts, during the long ſeaſon of abſence for the purpoſes of commerce, their bows, arrows, nets, and ſuch furniture as their few wants require, conſtitutes an intereſting proof of the honeſty of this harmleſs race of people; in ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars they agree with the natives of <hi>Kam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka;</hi> and tombs far exceeding the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the apparent population, excited ſimilar aſtoniſhment, and gives the ſame cauſe for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, as the numerous memorials of the dead on the coaſt of <hi>America</hi> obſerved by <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couver.</hi>

                  <q>THE town where the <hi>Japanners</hi> have their chiefe reſidence and mart is called <hi>Matchma,</hi> therein are five hundred houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of <hi>Japanners,</hi> who likewiſe have a fort there, the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour whereof is called <hi>Matchmadonna.</hi> This towne of <hi>Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> is the principall marte towne of all <hi>Yedzo,</hi> whither the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines moſt reſort to buy and ſell, eſpecially in <hi>September</hi> for their prouiſion for winter. In <hi>March,</hi> they bring downe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and dryed fiſh of ſundrie ſorts, and other wares for which the <hi>Japanners</hi> barter, which the <hi>Japanners</hi> rather deſire than ſiluer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE <hi>Japanners</hi> haue no ſetled being or trade in any other towne then <hi>Matchma.</hi> That further to the northward upon the ſame land, are people of very low ſtature like dwarfes. That the <hi>Yedzos</hi> are people of the ſtature of the <hi>Japanners,</hi> and haue no apparell but what is brought them from <hi>Japan.</hi> That there ſettleth a very violent current between <hi>Yedzo</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> which commeth from <hi>Corea,</hi> and ſetteth to the eaſt-north-eaſt. That the winds are for the moſt part, as uſually they are in <hi>Japan,</hi> viz. that the northerly winds beginne in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0792500103:286"/>
                     <hi>September,</hi> and end in <hi>March,</hi> and then the ſoutherly winds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to blow.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE account given by the commander of the <hi>Caſtricom,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in a great meaſure with the above. The author of the <hi>Recueil de Voyages au Nord,</hi> vol. iv. has preſerved the voyage. It appears that the captain had landed in ſeveral places; that in Lat. 44° 30′, he found the country very mountanous and high, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with lofty trees, many of which were fit for maſts; the ſoil very clayey and wet, and near the ſhores covered with bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; it was reported that there were ſeveral rich ſilver mines.</p>
               <p>IN Lat. 45° 10′,
<note place="margin">ACQUIES.</note> at a place called <hi>Acquies,</hi> the land was very high, and covered with trees. The ſoil clayey, but producing good fruits, ſuch as mulberries, red and white gooſeberries, raſpberries, &amp;c. alſo oaks and other kinds of trees, and in the vallies lilies of a vaſt height. The rivers are bordered by ruſhes, and alſo with red roſes.</p>
               <p>IN Lat. 46° 30′, he fell into a great gulph abounding with ſalmon, the ſhore was covered with vegetables, and had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the coaſts of <hi>England;</hi> but the natives neither cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated the ground, nor made any advantage of their rich ſoil. The moſt northern part of the range which he touched at on this coaſt, was in Lat. 48° 50′, where he found the land riſe into little hills cloathed with herbage; and met with good ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, in from 25 to 40 fathoms depth, with a bottom of ſand.</p>
               <p>HE ſpeaks in general of the inhabitants of the coaſt of <hi>Jeſo</hi> as being ſtrong and ſquare made,
<note place="margin">NATIVES OF JESO.</note> ſhort and groſs, their hair and beard long, and the laſt ſo thick as almoſt to cover their whole face; their bodies likewiſe very hairy; the hair on the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0792500103:287"/>fore part of the head is ſhaved. The features are tolerably good, their eyes black, forehead flat, complexion yellow; both ſexes wear rings in their ears and on their fingers. Their dreſs is of the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> faſhion; ſome is made of ſilk, others of ſtuff, and others of the ſkins of animals.</p>
               <p>THEIR houſes are built againſt the ſlope of a hill,
<note place="margin">HOUSES.</note> conſtructed of planks, and covered with the bark of trees; they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the trunks, and have an hole at top to let out the ſmoke; their fire-place is in the middle of the floor; their doors ſo low that they are obliged to creep in. The only fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture is matting made by the women; to theſe add a cup and a plate of varniſhed ware for each individual in the family. In ſome reſpects the houſes reſemble thoſe of <hi>Nootka Sound,</hi> and are in groups of fifteen or twenty, each group about half a league diſtant from the other, and each ſeems to be peopled with a kindred clan.</p>
               <p>THE common food of the natives is the lard and oil of whales,
<note place="margin">FOOD.</note> fiſh, and all ſorts of vegetables, eſpecially the fruit of roſes, which are as large as medlars, and being dried, are conſidered as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent winter proviſion. Notwithſtanding this, they often die of cold or famine. It is cuſtomary with them to put their dead into a caſe, and cover them with oyſter-ſhells; theſe are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by four poſts, placed beneath huts neatly made.</p>
               <p>THE natives of <hi>Matſumai</hi> ſhew very few ſigns of religion,
<note place="margin">RELIGION.</note> nor have they any idols. When they drink, if they are near the fire, they pour a few drops into it; they alſo ſtick in their chambers ſome ſmall rods with little flags at the end. If a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0792500103:288"/>perſon falls ſick, they cut long ſlips of the wood, and tie them round the head and arms of the patient.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the rude appearance of theſe people,
<note place="margin">MANNERS.</note> they are prudent and civilized in their manners, and among ſtrangers pay them the compliment of putting on their beſt cloaths.</p>
               <p>THEY are a very indolent race; never cultivate the ground, but paſs much of their time on the water in canoes, which they call <hi>praos,</hi> cut out of the trunk of ſome great tree, raiſed on the ſide with planks. In theſe they go to the chace of ſeals, which they ſhoot with arrows, or of whales, which they harpoon. They beſide catch other fiſhes with ſeines, in the manner done in <hi>Europe.</hi> Several objects of chace are mentioned. Birds they catch in ſnares; and ſhoot with arrows elks, roes, ſtags, bears, and other animals unknown to the <hi>Dutch</hi> navigators. Beſides the weapons I have mentioned, they wear a ſhort cutlaſs made of iron, which they procure from the <hi>Japaneſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HEMP grows wild in the country,
<note place="margin">HEMP.</note> the women ſpin it, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by ſplitting it firſt; they then hold one end between their teeth, and turn and twiſt it into thread on a diſtaff.</p>
               <p>THE natives exchange with the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> the lard and oil of whales and fiſhes, the dried tongues of whales, furs, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of eagles, for winging of arrows. The people of <hi>Japan</hi> pay them an annual viſit, and bring in return rice, ſugar, ſilken cloaths in the <hi>Japaneſe</hi> faſhion, ſmoaking-pipes, tobacco, and varniſhed cups and plates. The <hi>Japaneſe</hi> ſeem to have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced civilization among theſe people by their intercourſe with
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0792500103:289"/>them. The <hi>Chineſe</hi> ſometimes come and trade with them. The capital of this chain of iſlands is called <hi>Matſumai,</hi> and is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of the prince or governor, who annually makes a voyage to <hi>Jedo,</hi> to do homage to the emperor. The <hi>Japaneſe</hi> once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to extend their conqueſts from <hi>Matſumai</hi> northward; they ſucceeded at firſt, but after a revolt of the inhabitants
<note n="*" place="bottom">Kaempfer, i. p. 65.</note>, are now content to accept from the chieftain, whom they ſtile prince of <hi>Jeſo,</hi> a tribute of very ſmall value, which is annually paid at <hi>Matſumai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE now arrive at the ſouthernmoſt iſles of the long chain of the <hi>Kurils.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">KURIL ISLES.</note> I have given an account of the moſt northern in my introduction to the <hi>Arctic Zoology.</hi> The whole chain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verges to the north-eaſt in a direct line, and concludes very near to the cape of <hi>Lopatka,</hi> in <hi>Kamſchatka.</hi> The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> reckon <hi>Matſumai</hi> among the number. Thoſe next to the land of <hi>Jeſo</hi> were diſcovered by the <hi>Caſticrom. Tſchicota, Kounaſchir,</hi> and <hi>Atorkou</hi> are the moſt ſouthern; the two firſt lie oppoſite to <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumai,</hi> and at no great diſtance from its coaſts, and <hi>Atorkou</hi> a little to the north-eaſt. <hi>Tſchicota</hi> is a hundred and twenty verſts, or ninety miles long, and forty miles broad. <hi>Kounaſchir</hi> is about a hundred and twelve miles long, and about thirty-ſeven broad, and <hi>Atorkou,</hi> or <hi>Etorpu,</hi> is equal in length and breadth, being two hundred and twenty-five miles acroſs, according to the <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> accounts in the <hi>Neue Nordiſche Beytrage</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. iv. 133.</note>. This iſland is the <hi>Staten-land</hi> of the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">STATEN-LAND.</note> a name beſtowed on it in their voyage of 1643.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ouropi</hi> is the <hi>Company</hi>'s land of the ſame voyagers;
<note place="margin">COMPANY'S LAND.</note> and they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0792500103:290"/>beſtowed on the ſtreight which ſeparates it from <hi>Atorkou</hi> the name of <hi>De Vries's,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">DE VRIES'S STREIGHT.</note> in honor of their commander. No places have puzzled geographers ſo greatly. <hi>D'Anville</hi> gives to <hi>Jeſo, Joſogaſima,</hi> as it is ſometimes called, the form of a vaſt iſland; and to the <hi>Company's Land</hi> and <hi>Staten-land</hi> a figure poſſibly very different from the reality. The editors of <hi>Cook</hi>'s Voyage make them only ſmall iſlands. The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> again, in their hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Kamſchatka,</hi> give them another form; and Mr. <hi>Arrow-ſmith</hi> very properly leaves it undecided whether <hi>Jeſo</hi> is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or archipelago. This being mentioned, we haſten to the concluſion of this volume, and give a brief account of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the <hi>Kuril</hi> iſles. <hi>Etorpu,</hi> the nineteenth in order, reckoning from <hi>Lopatka-noſs,</hi> comes next. Moſt of the iſlands of this long chain are volcanic. <hi>Raſchotti,</hi> the tenth, has in our days been ſo rent with an earthquake, as entirely to drive away the numerous flocks of birds that uſed to frequent its cliffs; but the ſea-lions ſtill keep their ſtations.
<note place="margin">VOLCANOES.</note> On <hi>Kounaſchir,</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, is one volcano; on <hi>Etorpu</hi> are two; on <hi>Amakutan</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and on the lofty <hi>Poromoſchir,</hi> the higheſt in the chain, remarkable for its vaſt peaked mountains, is probably another. I have treated of theſe iſlands ſo fully in my introduction to the <hi>Arctic Zoology,</hi> that I ſhall not tire my reader with the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I therefore will only ſay here, that many of them have been conquered by the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> who, not thinking them worth the expence of colonizing, content themſelves with accepting a ſmall tribute.</p>
               <p>THE inhabitants reſemble thoſe of the land of <hi>Jeſo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">NATIVES.</note> and are equally hairy. By the accounts of the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> who viſited theſe
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0792500103:291"/>iſlands in 1777, they differ in ſome of their cuſtoms from the former. They have multitudes of little houſehold gods, like the <hi>Mongol Tartars,</hi> and they pay a worſhip to the owl. The <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gols</hi> do the ſame, for the reaſon given in the zoological part of the <hi>Arctic Zoology</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. i. p. 272.</note>. This may direct us to the origin of theſe iſlanders. They bury their dead in the earth, and believe in a future life, to be paſſed in certain ſubterraneous regions.</p>
