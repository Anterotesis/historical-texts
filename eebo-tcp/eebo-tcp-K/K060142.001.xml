            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE kind Reception which the laſt Edition of this Work has met with, determined the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors to ſpare no Expence to make the preſent as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete as the Nature of the Work would admit; and the Editor, in purſuance of their Intention, has (beſides his own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and Experience) been favour'd with ſuch ample Materials by ſeveral curious Gentlemen, as have made it impoſſible to comprize the Whole in Three Volumes, as before; altho' he omitted all that could be ſpared, and abſtracted whatever would bear it. He was therefore obliged to add a Fourth Volume.</p>
            <p>And this he found himſelf under the greater Neceſſity of doing; becauſe, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n he came to compare the former Edition with
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0141100401:3"/>
his own Notes and the Maps, he diſcovered many very material Omiſſions; particularly that the whole County of <hi>Hertford</hi> was omitted, excepting <hi>St. Albans,</hi> and one or two Villages, as alſo the Iſles of <hi>Wight, Portland, Guernſey, Jerſey, Alderney,</hi> and <hi>Sarke</hi>; together with that of <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>Scots Iſles:</hi> That the Deſcription of the Northern Counties of <hi>England,</hi> which abound with great Numbers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markables, was alſo very defective: and, That the firſt Author had directed his <hi>Tour</hi> in ſeveral Places in ſuch a manner, as to paſs wholly by ſeveral of the beſt Towns, and moſt remarkable Places, and quite out of any Geographical Courſe or Order.</p>
            <p>Then the Materials which the Editor was ſupplied with for <hi>Scotland,</hi> he found would ſwell that Part of the United King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to one intire Volume; which before made not half a one; and he was glad of the Opportunity of doing ſome further Juſtice to that Country, which has generally been ſlightly conſidered by thoſe who know little of it.</p>
            <p>It muſt alſo be obſerved, that the firſt Author had, in many Places, diſclaimed Antiquities, as a Subject out of his Province: Whereas we have thought
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0141100401:4"/>
ourſelves obliged, ſo far as our Limits would permit, to take Notice of ſuch, as (ſtill remaining) may be conſidered as a Part of the Preſent State of the Counties and Places where, at this Day, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue viſible; and which may, moreover, merit the Attention of a curious Traveller; and particularly of ſuch Antiquities as have been brought to Light ſince the laſt Edition of <hi>Camden</hi>'s <hi>Britannia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the above Reaſon, we have been pretty ample in our Accounts of the famous <hi>Stonehenge,</hi> and the Barrows in <hi>Wilts</hi>; and confeſs our Obligations on this Head, to the Learned Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> in his late Work on that Subject, to whom we are alſo beholden in ſeveral other Places.</p>
            <p>We have likewiſe thought ourſelves obliged to take Notice of the Benefits which ſeveral Port and Trading Towns in this Kingdom, as well in its Northern as Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts, have of late Years received from Acts of Parliament for inlarging and reſtoring of Piers and Harbours, Repairs of Roads, and for making Rivers navigable, where the Face of Affairs in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Neighbourhoods have been any way altered or effected by thoſe laudable Works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0141100401:5"/>We have, moreover, ſubjoined to this Edition, Liſts of the Cities and Boroughs which return Members to the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; the Liſts of ſuch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Seats in each County, as we had not room to deſcribe; likewiſe a brief Account of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhopricks, and Liſts of the Peers of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in ſuch a manner as will not be ſubject to any other Variations than that of the total Extinction of Families; for our Intention was to carry this Piece, as much as the Nature of the Work would admit, beyond the Reach of temporary Fluctuations and Changes.</p>
            <p>By what we have ſaid, it will appear, that this will have the Face of a new Work, and indeed more than the <hi>Face,</hi> as will be ſeen by any who will take the Pains to compare the different Editions; and that therefore it was impoſſible to print by themſelves, for the Uſe of the Purchaſers of the laſt Edition, thoſe new Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Deſcriptions and Corrections which are incorporated in the preſent; as the Proprietors were very deſirous to have done, had it been practicable. But this we may venture to promiſe, that tho' the Nature of this Work is ſuch, that there muſt be always Room for Additions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0141100401:6"/>
as new Diſcoveries may be made, or Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations happen by Time; yet, that all ſuch neceſſary Alterations and Additions ſhall, for the future, be printed by themſelves, (after the manner of the <hi>Appendix</hi> to VOL. III. of this Edition) that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may not be under the Neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purchaſing the whole Work.</p>
            <p>But leſt it ſhould be imagined, from any thing we have ſaid above, that we have been ſo ungenerous, as to endeavour to raiſe a Merit to the preſent Edition, at the Expence of the former, we ſhall obſerve, That the good Reception which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the Original Author met with in his firſt Edition, (and which alſo attended the ſecond, which was printed with very great Additions and Improvements) is no bad Argument of the Value of his Performance. And indeed <hi>He</hi> well deſerved that Succeſs, who could with Juſtice give ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Abilities for the Undertaking, as is contained in the following Paragraphs.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">
                  <p>'The Preparations for this Work, ſays he, have been ſuitable to the Author's earneſt Concern for its Uſefulneſs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen very large Circuits, or Journeys, have been taken thro' divers Parts ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and Three general Tours over
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0141100401:7"/>
almoſt the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Part of the Iſland; in all which the Author has not been wanting to treaſure up juſt Remarks upon particular Places and Things; ſo that he is very little in Debt to other Mens Labours, and gives but very few Accounts of Things but what he has been an Eye-witneſs of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>'Beſides theſe ſeveral Journeys in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he has alſo lived ſome time in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and has travelled critically over great Part of it: He has viewed the North Part of <hi>England,</hi> and the South Part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Five ſeveral times over. All which is hinted here, to let the Readers know, what Reaſon they have to be ſatisfy'd with the Authority of the Relation; and that the Accounts here given are not the Produce of a curſory View, or raiſed upon the borrow'd Lights of other Obſervers.'</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall only add, That if the Firſt Edition had all theſe Advantages, we may very ſafely ſubmit the Merit of the preſent to the Judgment of the candid Reader.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> SET out from <hi>London</hi> on my firſt Journey, Eaſtward; and took a <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit</hi> down by the Coaſt of the <hi>Thames</hi> thro' the Marſhes or Hundreds, on the South ſide of the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to <hi>Malden, Colcheſter,</hi> and <hi>Harwich,</hi> thence continuing on the Coaſt of <hi>Suffolk</hi> to <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>; thence round by the Edge of the Sea, on the North and Weſt-ſide of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to <hi>Lynn, Wiſbich,</hi> and the <hi>Waſh</hi>; thence back again on the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0141100401:9"/>
North-ſide of <hi>Suffolk</hi>; thence into the County of <hi>Cambridge</hi>; and ſo to the Weſt-part of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> near the Place where I began: reſerving the Middle or Centre of the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſome little Excurſions, which I made by themſelves.</p>
            <p>Paſſing <hi>Bow-Bridge,</hi> where the County of <hi>Eſſex</hi> begins, I came firſt to the Village of <hi>Stratford,</hi> which is greatly increaſed of late Years in Houſes and Inhabitants, every Vacancy being filled up, in a manner, with the Addition of two little new-built Hamlets, <hi>as they may be called,</hi> on the Foreſt-ſide of the Town; namely, <hi>Maryland-Point,</hi> and the <hi>Gravel-Pits,</hi> one facing the Road to <hi>Woodford</hi> and <hi>Epping,</hi> and the other that to <hi>Ilford.</hi> As for the Hither-part, it is almoſt joined to <hi>Bow,</hi> in ſpite of Rivers, Canals, Marſhy-grounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Increaſe of Buildings may be ſeen proportionally in the other Villages adjacent, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the Foreſt-ſide; as at <hi>Low-Layton, Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-ſtone, Walthamſtow, Woodford, Wanſted,</hi> and the Towns of <hi>Weſt-Ham, Plaiſtow, Upton,</hi> &amp;c. and this, generally ſpeaking, of handſome large Houſes, from 20<hi>l.</hi> to 50<hi>l.</hi> a Year; being chiefly the Habitations of the richeſt Citizens, ſuch as are able to keep a Country, as well as a Town Houſe, or ſuch as have left off Trade altogether. This is ſo apparent, that they tell me, there are no leſs than Two hundred Coaches kept by the Inhabitants within the Circumference of the few Villages named above, beſides ſuch as are kept by accidental Lodgers: the Cauſe of which I ſhall inlarge upon, when I come to ſpeak of the like in the Counties of <hi>Middleſex, Surrey,</hi> &amp;c. where there will be ſtill more Occaſion to take notice of it.</p>
            <p>There have been diſcerned within theſe few Years, in the Bottom of <hi>Hackney-Marſh,</hi> between <hi>Old-ford</hi> and the <hi>Wyck,</hi> the Remains of a great Stone Cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0141100401:10"/>
which is ſuppoſed to have been the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or great Road, from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Eſſex,</hi> inſtead of that which now leads over the Bridge between <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Stratford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the great Road lay this Way, and that the great Cauſeway continu'd juſt over the River, where now the <hi>Temple-Mills</hi> ſtand, and paſſed by Sir <hi>Henry Hickes</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Ruckholls,</hi> is not at all doubted; and that it was one of thoſe famous Highways made by the <hi>Romans,</hi> there is undeniable Proof, by the ſeveral Marks of <hi>Roman</hi> Work, and by <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, and other Antiquities found there, ſome of which were collected by the late Reverend Mr. <hi>Strype,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Low-Layton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence the great Road paſſed up to <hi>Layton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> a Place by ſome known now as much by the Sign of the <hi>Green-Man,</hi> formerly a Lodge upon the Edge of the Foreſt; and croſſing by <hi>Wanſted-houſe,</hi> the noble Seat of Earl <hi>Tilney,</hi> (of which hereafter) went over the ſame River, which we now croſs at <hi>Ilford</hi>; and paſſing that Part of the great Foreſt, called <hi>Henault-Foreſt,</hi> came into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent great Road, a little on this ſide the <hi>Whalebone,</hi> a Place ſo called becauſe a Rib-bone of a large Whale, taken in the River of <hi>Thames</hi> the Year that <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> died, 1658. was fixed there.</p>
            <p>According to my firſt Intention, of effectually viewing the Sea-coaſts of <hi>Eſſex, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> I went from <hi>Stratford</hi> to <hi>Barking,</hi> a large Market-town, but chiefly inhabited by Fiſhermen, whoſe Smacks ride in the <hi>Thames,</hi> at the Mouth of <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Creek; from whence their Fiſh are ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> to the Market at <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> in ſmall Boats.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fiſhing-Smacks are very uſeful Veſſels to the Publick upon many Occaſions; as particularly in time of War they are uſed as Preſs-ſmacks, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all the Northern and Weſtern Coaſts to pick

up Seamen to man the Navy, when any Expedition is at hand, that requires a ſudden Equipment. At other times, being excellent Sailors, they are Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to particular Men of War; and on an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they have been made uſe of as Machines, for the blowing up fortified Ports; as formerly at <hi>St. Malo,</hi> and other Places.</p>
            <p>The Pariſh of <hi>Barking</hi> is very large; and by the Improvement of Lands recovered out of the <hi>Thames,</hi> and out of the River which runs by the Town, the great and ſmall Tithes, as the Townſmen aſſured me, are worth above 600<hi>l. per Annum.</hi> This Pariſh has two Chapels of Eaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> one at <hi>Ilford,</hi> and one on the ſide of the Foreſt, called <hi>New-chapel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little beyond the Town, on the Road to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genham,</hi> ſtood a great old Houſe, where, Tradition ſays, the <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon</hi> was contrived, and where all the firſt Conſultations about it were held.</p>
            <p>This Side of the County is rather rich from the Nature of its Land, than from the Number of its Inhabitants, which is occaſioned by the Unhealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air; for theſe low Marſh Grounds, which, with all the South-ſide of the County, have been gained, as it were, out of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> and the Sea, where the River is wide enough to be called ſo, begin here, or rather at <hi>Weſt-Ham,</hi> by <hi>Stratford,</hi> and extend themſelves from hence Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; growing wider, till we come beyond <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> when the flat Country lies ſix, ſeven, or eight Miles in Breadth, and is both unhealthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant.</p>
            <p>However, it is very good Farming in the Marſhes, becauſe the Landlords let good Peny-worths, tho' the Land is rich; for it being a Place where every body cannot live, thoſe that venture it, will have Encouragement; and it is but reaſonable they ſhould.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0141100401:12"/>In paſſing from <hi>Barking</hi> to <hi>Dagenham,</hi> we ſaw the Place where was the famous Breach, that laid near 5000 Acres of Land under Water; but which, after near ten Years Inundation, and the Works being ſeveral times blown up, was at laſt effectually ſtopped by Captain <hi>Perry,</hi> who for ſeveral Years had been employed in the Czar of <hi>Muſcovy</hi>'s Works, at <hi>Veronitza,</hi> on the River <hi>Don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Part of the Lands in theſe Levels, eſpecially thoſe on this ſide <hi>Eaſt-Tilbury,</hi> are held by the Farmers, Cow-keepers, and Graſing-butchers, who live in and near <hi>London,</hi> who generally ſtock them with <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> Wethers, (which they buy in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> when the Graſiers ſell off their Stocks) and feed here till <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> or <hi>Candlemas</hi>; and tho' they are not made much the fatter here, than when bought in, yet very good Advantage accrues by the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Price of Mutton between <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> when cheapeſt, and <hi>Candlemas,</hi> when deareſt; and this is what the Butchers call, by way of Excellence, <hi>right Marſh Mutton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the End of theſe Marſhes, cloſe to the Edge of the River, ſtands <hi>Tilbury-fort,</hi> which may juſtly be looked upon as the Key of the City of <hi>London:</hi> It is a regular Fortification, the Deſign of it was a a Pentagon, but the Water-baſtion, as it would have been called, was never built; the Plan was laid out by Sir <hi>Martin Beckman,</hi> chief Engineer to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. who alſo deſigned the Works at <hi>Sheerneſs.</hi> The Eſplanade of the Fort is very large, and the Baſtions the largeſt of any in <hi>England.</hi> The Foundation is laid upon Piles driven down two an end of one another, ſo far, till they were aſſured they were below the Chanel of the River, and that the Piles, which were pointed with Iron, entered into the ſolid Chalk-rock adjoining to the Chalk-hills on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0141100401:13"/>The Works to the Land-ſide are complete; the Baſtions are faced with Brick. There is a double Ditch, or Moat, the innermoſt of which is 180 Feet broad; a good Counterſcarp, and a Covered Way marked out, with Ravelins and Tenailles; but they have not been completed.</p>
            <p>On the Land-ſide there are alſo two ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts of Brick, but the chief Strength of this Fort on the Land-ſide conſiſts in being able to lay the whole Level under Water, and ſo to make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for an Enemy to carry on Approaches that way.</p>
            <p>On the Side next the River, is a very ſtrong Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with a noble Gate called the <hi>Water-gate</hi> in the Middle, and the Ditch is paliſado'd. At the Place where the Water-baſtion was deſigned to be built, and which by the Plan ſhould run wholly out into the River, ſo to flank the two Curtains, on each ſide, ſtands a high Tower, which they tell us was built in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, and was called the <hi>Block-houſe</hi>; the Side next the Water is vacant.</p>
            <p>Before this Curtain, above and below the ſaid Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, is a Platform in the place of a Counterſcarp, on which are planted 106 Cannon, generally carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from 24 to 46 Pound Ball; a Battery ſo terrible, as well imports the Conſequence of that Place: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, there are ſmaller Pieces planted between, and the Baſtions and Curtain alſo are planted with Guns; ſo that they muſt be bold Fellows who will venture in the biggeſt Ships to paſs ſuch a Battery, if the Men appointed to ſerve the Guns, do their Duty, as becomes them.</p>
            <p>From hence there is nothing for many Miles together remarkable, but a continued Level of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy Marſhes, called <hi>The three Hundreds,</hi> till we come before <hi>Leigh,</hi> and to the Mouth of the Rivers <hi>Chelmer</hi> and <hi>Black-water,</hi> ſaving that the Towns of <hi>Horndon, Rayley</hi> and <hi>Rochford,</hi> lie near
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0141100401:14"/>
the Sea-coaſt, extending in the order I have named; but are of no Note. The above Rivers, united, make a large Firth, or Inlet of the Sea, which our Fiſhermen and Seamen, who uſe it as a Port, call <hi>Malden-water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Inlet is <hi>Oſey</hi> or <hi>Oſyth</hi> Iſland, ſo well known by our <hi>London</hi> Men of Pleaſure, for producing ſuch vaſt Numbers of Wild-Ducks, Mallards, Teals and Wigeons, that the Iſland ſeems covered with them, at certain Times of the Year, and they go from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for the Pleaſure of Shooting; and often come home very well loaden with Game; and ſometimes too with an <hi>Eſſex</hi> Ague on their Backs, which they find a heavier Load than the Fowls they have ſhot.</p>
            <p>On the Shore, beginning a little below <hi>Candy Iſland,</hi> or <hi>Leigh Road,</hi> lies a great Shoal or Sand, called the <hi>Black Tayl,</hi> which runs out near three Leagues into the Sea due Eaſt; at the End of it ſtands a Pole or Maſt, ſet up by the <hi>Trinity-houſe</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as a Sea-mark: this is called <hi>Shoe-beacon,</hi> from the Point of Land, where this Sand begins, which is called <hi>Shoeberry-neſs,</hi> from a Town of that Name, which ſtands by it. From this Sand, and on the Edge of <hi>Shoeberry,</hi> before it, or South-weſt of it, all along, to the Mouth of <hi>Colcheſter-water,</hi> the Shore is full of Shoals and Sands, with ſome deep Chanels between; all which are ſo full of Fiſh, that the <hi>Barking</hi> Smacks are well employed here, and the Shore ſwarms, beſides, with ſmall Fiſher-boats, belonging to the Villages and Towns on the Coaſt, which come in every Tide with what they take: and ſelling the ſmaller Fiſh in the Country, ſend the beſt and largeſt upon Horſes, which travel Night and Day to <hi>London</hi> Market.</p>
            <p>On this Shore alſo are taken the beſt and moſt reliſhing, tho' not the largeſt, Oyſters in <hi>England:</hi> The Spot from whence they have their Appellation is a little Bank called <hi>Woelfleet,</hi> in the Mouth of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0141100401:15"/>
River <hi>Crouch,</hi> called <hi>Crookſea-water</hi>; but the chief Place where theſe Oyſters are now had, is from <hi>Wyvenhoe,</hi> and the Shores adjacent, whither they are brought by the Fiſhermen, who take them at the Mouth of <hi>Colcheſter-water,</hi> and about the Sand they call the <hi>Spits,</hi> and carry them up to <hi>Wyvenhoe,</hi> where they are laid in Beds or Pits on the Shore to feed, as they call it; and then being barrelled up, and carried to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> which is but three Miles off, they are ſent to <hi>London</hi> by Land, and are from thence called <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Oyſters.</p>
            <p>They take alſo here fine Soals, which generally yield a good Price at <hi>London</hi> Market: alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times middling Turbut, with Whitings, Codling, and large Flounders.</p>
            <p>In the ſeveral Creeks and Openings, on this Shore, are alſo other Iſlands, but of no great Note, except <hi>Merſey,</hi> which lies between the two Openings of <hi>Malden-water</hi> and <hi>Colcheſter-water</hi>; and is a Place of ſuch difficult Acceſs, that 'tis thought a thouſand Men might keep Poſſeſſion of it againſt a great Force, whether by Land or Sea. On this account, and becauſe if poſſeſſed by an Enemy, it would ſhut up all the Navigation and Fiſhery on that Side, a Fort was built on the South-eaſt Point of it; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, in a <hi>Dutch</hi> War, a ſtrong Gariſon is kept there to defend it.</p>
            <p>At this Place may be ſaid to end, what we call the <hi>Three Hundreds</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which include the marſhy Country, <hi>viz. Barſtable</hi> Hundred, <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Hundred, and <hi>Dengy</hi> Hundred.</p>
            <p>One thing deſerves mention here; which is, That all along this County it is very frequent to meet with Men that have had from Five or Six, to Fourteen or Fifteen Wives; and I was informed, that in the Marſhes, over-againſt <hi>Candy Iſland,</hi> was a Farmer, who was then living with the five-and-twentieth; and that his Son, who was but Thirty-five
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0141100401:16"/>
Years old, had already had about Fourteen. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this Part of the Story I only had by Report, tho' from good Hands: but the other is well known, and will be atteſted, about <hi>Fobbing, Curringham, Thunderſly, Benfleet, Prittlewell, Wakering, Great Stambridge, Crickſea, Burnham, Dengy,</hi> and other Towns of the like Situation: the Reaſon, as a merry Fellow told me, who ſaid he had had about a Dozen, was this, That they being bred in the Marſhes themſelves, and ſeaſoned to the Place, did pretty well; but that they generally choſe to leave their own Laſſes to their Neighbours out of the Marſhes, and went into the Uplands for a Wife: That when they took the young Women out of the wholſome freſh Air, they were clear and healthy; but when they came into the Marſhes among the Fogs and Damps, they preſently changed Complexion, got an Ague or two, and ſeldom held it above half a Year, or a Year at moſt: And then, ſaid he, we go to the Uplands again, and fetch another. So that marrying of Wives was reckoned a kind of good Farm to them. Nor do the Men in theſe Parts hold it out, as in other Countries; for we ſeldom meet with very ancient People among the Poor; inſomuch, that hardly one half of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are Natives of the Place; but ſuch as come from other Parts for the Advantage of good Farms.</p>
            <p>From the Marſhes and low Grounds, being not able to travel without many Windings and Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by reaſon of the Creeks and Waters, I came up to the antient Town of <hi>Malden,</hi> ſituate at the Conflux of two principal Rivers, the <hi>Chelmer</hi> and the <hi>Black-water,</hi> where they enter into the Sea. It is built in the Form of a Croſs, is a Liberty in itſelf, and has a convenient Haven for Ships; it conſiſts of one Street near a Mile long, beſides Lanes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is governed by Two Bailiffs, Aldermen, Steward, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is a good publick Library, for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0141100401:17"/>
the Uſe of the Miniſter and the Clergy of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds adjoining to the Sea, and any Gentleman may borrow a Book, upon depoſiting the Value of it.</p>
            <p>The Chanel called <hi>Malden-water</hi> is navigable to the Town; where, by that means, is a great Trade for carrying Corn by Water to <hi>London</hi>; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Eſſex</hi> being (eſpecially on that Side) a great Corn Country. King <hi>Edward the Elder</hi> reſided here whilſt he built the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Witham</hi> in this County, and alſo <hi>Hertford</hi> Caſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Malden</hi> was a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, which <hi>Camden</hi> diffidently conjectures to be the antient <hi>Camalodunum.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Salmon</hi> will have it to be the <hi>Villa Fauſtini,</hi> which has been ſo long attributed to <hi>St. Edmund's-bury:</hi> but however that be, it was here the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> under the valiant Queen <hi>Boadicea,</hi> cut in Pieces the tenth Legion, killed above 80,000 <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and deſtroyed the Colony; but ſhe was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards overthrown herſelf in a great Battle, 60,000 <hi>Britons</hi> ſlain, and herſelf and Daughters moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly treated and diſgraced, by thoſe great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of the World, who, in her Caſe, forgot not only the Honour due to the Sex, but that which the truly Brave ſhew to the Brave in Misfortune.</p>
            <p>Being obliged to come thus far into the Uplands, I made it my Road to paſs thro' <hi>Witham,</hi> built, as I mentioned, by <hi>Edward the Elder.</hi> 'Tis a pleaſant, well-ſituated Market-town, in which, and in its Neighbourhood, are many Gentlemen of good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and Families.</p>
            <p>Nearer <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> hard by <hi>Boreham,</hi> is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Seat of <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> in which King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. very much delighted. It is the largeſt Edifice in the County next <hi>Audley-end,</hi> where lived the late Lord Viſcount <hi>Barrington,</hi> who had the Advantage to be twice made Heir to the Eſtates of Gentlemen not at all related to him, at leaſt one of them, as is mentioned in his Patent of Creation. He changed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0141100401:18"/>
the Name of <hi>Shute</hi> for that of <hi>Barrington,</hi> by an Act of Parliament, and had the Dignities of a Baron and Viſcount of <hi>Ireland</hi> conferred on him by K. <hi>Geo.</hi> I.</p>
            <p>The Product of all this Part of the Country is Corn, as that of the marſhy feeding Grounds is Graſs, where their chief Buſineſs is breeding of Calves, which I need not ſay are the beſt and fatteſt, and the largeſt Veal in <hi>England,</hi> if not in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kelvedon,</hi> or, as it is commonly called, <hi>Keldon,</hi> lies within three Miles of <hi>Witham</hi>; which, as it is ſaid, derives its Name from <hi>Kill-Dane,</hi> the Maſſacre of the <hi>Danes</hi> being begun here by the Women; but as neither Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> nor any Author of Credit mentions it, I think the Story is not to be heeded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> the <hi>Iciani</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Salmon,</hi> is pleaſantly ſituated upon an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above the River <hi>Coln.</hi> It is a large and populous Town, adorned with handſome Streets, and, tho' it cannot be ſaid to be finely built, yet there are abundance of good Houſes in it. In the Concluſion of the late Civil War it ſuffered a ſevere Siege; which, as it made a reſolute Defence, was turned into a Blockade, wherein the Gariſon, and Inhabitants alſo, ſuffered the utmoſt Extremity of Hunger, and were at laſt obliged to ſurrender at Diſcretion; when their two chief Officers, Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> were ſhot to Death under the Caſtle-wall.</p>
            <p>The battered Walls, the Breaches in the Turrets, and the ruined Churches, ſtill ſhew Marks of this Siege, except that the Church of <hi>St. Mary</hi> (where they had the Royal Fort) is rebuilt; but the Steeple, which was Two-thirds battered down, (the Beſieged having a large Culverin upon it, which did much Execution) remains ſtill in that Condition.</p>
            <p>The Lines of Contravallation, which ſurrounded the whole Town, and the Forts of the Beſiegers, remain very viſible in many Places.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0141100401:19"/>The River <hi>Coln,</hi> which paſſes through the Town, encompaſſes it on the North and Eaſt; and ſerved, in Times of War, for a complete Defence on thoſe Sides. There are three Bridges over it, and it is navigable within three Miles of the Town, for Ships of large Burden; a little lower it may receive even a Royal Navy: and up to that Part called the <hi>Hithe,</hi> cloſe to the Houſes, it is navigable for Hoys and ſmall Barks; for which it is indebted to three Acts of Parliament paſſed for that purpoſe, one in the Reign of King <hi>William</hi> III. one in that of King <hi>George</hi> I. and the other in that of King <hi>George</hi> II.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hithe</hi> is a long Street, paſſing from Weſt to Eaſt, on the South-ſide of the Town, and is ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous towards the River, that it may be called, <hi>The Wapping of Colcheſter.</hi> There is one Church in that Part of the Town, a large Quay by the River, and a good Cuſtom-houſe.</p>
            <p>The Town chiefly ſubſiſts by the Trade of making Bays, tho' indeed all the Towns around carry on the ſame Trade; as <hi>Kelvedon, Witham, Coggſhall, Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, Bocking,</hi> &amp;c. and the whole County, large as it is, may be ſaid to be employed, and in Part maintained, by the Spinning of Wool, for the Bay-Trade of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and its adjacent Towns.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> has been ſuppoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain about 40,000 People, including the Out-vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages within its Liberty, of which there are a great many, the Liberty of the Town being of a large Extent. The Government is by a Mayor, High-Steward, a Recorder or his Deputy, Eleven Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a Chamberlain, a Town-clerk, Aſſiſtants, and Eighteen Common-council-men.</p>
            <p>There are in <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Eight Churches, beſides thoſe which are damaged, and Five Meeting-houſes, whereof two for Quakers; beſides one <hi>Dutch,</hi> and one <hi>French</hi> Church. Its other publick Edifices are,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0141100401:20"/>1. <hi>Bay-hall,</hi> where the Goodneſs of the Manufacture of Bays made in this Town is aſcertained by a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration eſtabliſhed for this Purpoſe, conſiſting of a Set of Men, called Governors of the <hi>Dutch Bay-hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Guild-hall</hi> of the Town, called by them the <hi>Moot-hall</hi>; contiguous to which is the Town-gaol.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Work-houſe</hi> for the Poor, which has been inlarged of late Years.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Grammar Free-ſchool; which has good Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to the Maſter, who is choſen by the Town.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The Caſtle of Colcheſter</hi> is a Monument of the Antiquity of the Place, it being built, as the Walls of the Town alſo are, with <hi>Roman</hi> Bricks; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Coins dug up here, and ploughed up in the Fields adjoining, confirm it. The Inhabitants boaſt much, that <hi>Helena,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> firſt Chriſtian Emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was born there: but it would be hard to make it out; and indeed, were it our Buſineſs, we could produce ſtrong Proofs to the contrary. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays, That this Caſtle was, in his Time, ready to fall with Age; and yet it has ſtood above 120 Years ſince, and perhaps is not much worſe than it was then, altho' it received ſeveral Cannon Shot in the laſt Siege of the Town, which made no Impreſſion upon it, as the Beſiegers found, and therefore left off firing againſt it, and the rather, as the Gariſon made no great Uſe of it againſt them. The Queen's Head in the Market-place, and the Stable, are alſo <hi>Roman</hi> Buildings. There was likewiſe a <hi>Roman</hi> Military Way from <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> by <hi>Braintree, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mow,</hi> and farther that Way.</p>
            <p>There are two CHARITY-SCHOOLS ſet up here, and carried on by a generous Subſcription, with very good Succeſs.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Colcheſter</hi> I took a Turn down to the Coaſt. The Land running out a great way into the Sea, South, and South-eaſt, makes that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0141100401:21"/>
of Land, called the <hi>Naſe,</hi> well-known to Seamen who uſe the Northern Trade. Here one ſees a Sea open as an Ocean, without any oppoſite Shore, tho' it be no more than the Mouth of the <hi>Thames.</hi> This Point, called the <hi>Naſe,</hi> and the North-eaſt Point of <hi>Kent,</hi> near <hi>Margate,</hi> called the <hi>North-Foreland,</hi> make the Mouth of the River, and the Port of <hi>London,</hi> tho' it be here above 60 Miles over.</p>
            <p>But as it is pretended by ſome, that according to the preſent Uſage of the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> the Port of <hi>London</hi> is not allowed to extend ſo far; 'tis thought proper to inſert the Clauſe taken from the Act of Parliament, eſtabliſhing the Extent of that Port.</p>

            <p>This Obſervation may ſuffice for what is needful to be ſaid upon the ſame Subject, when I come to ſpeak of the Port of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and its Members, and their Privileges with reſpect to <hi>Rocheſter, Milton, Feverſham,</hi> &amp;c. in my Circuit thro' the County of <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Walton,</hi> under the <hi>Naſe,</hi> they find on the Shore Copperas-ſtones in great Quantities; and there are ſeveral large Works called Copperas-houſes, where 'tis made with great Expence.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>North-Foreland</hi> is a new Mark, erected by the <hi>Trinity-houſe</hi> Men, at the publick Expence, being a round Brick Tower, near 80 Feet high. The Sea gains ſo much upon the Land here, by the continual Winds at South-weſt, that within the Memory of ſome of the Inhabitants, above 30 Acres of Land have been loſt in one Place.</p>
            <p>From hence we go back into the County about four Miles, becauſe of the Creeks which lie between; and turning Eaſt again, come to <hi>Harwich,</hi> on the utmoſt Eaſtern Point of this large County.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harwich</hi> is a Town, ſtrong by Situation, and may be made more ſo by Art. The Harbour or Road is one of the ſecureſt in <hi>England,</hi> and covered at the Entrance by <hi>Landguard-fort,</hi> and a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of Guns to the Seaward, juſt as at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> and which ſufficiently defend the Mouth of the River. Tho' the Entrance or Opening of the River into the Sea is very wide, eſpecially at High-water, at leaſt two Miles, if not three, over; yet the Chanel, in which the Ships muſt keep and come to the Harbour, is deep, narrow, and lies only on the Side of the Fort; ſo that all the Ships
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0141100401:23"/>
which come in, or go out, muſt come within Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of the Fort.</p>
            <p>The Fort is on the <hi>Suffolk</hi> Side of the Bay, but ſtands ſo far into the Sea, upon the Point of a Sand or Shoal running out towards the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Side, that, in a manner, it covers the Mouth of the Haven; and our Surveyors of the Country affirm it to be in the County of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> The making this Place, which was formerly no other than a Sand in the Sea, ſolid enough for the Foundation of ſo good a Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, coſt many Years Labour, frequent Repairs, and a prodigious Expence; but 'tis now ſo firm, that neither Storms nor Tides affect it.</p>
            <p>The Harbour is of a vaſt Extent; for the River <hi>Stour</hi> from <hi>Maningtree,</hi> and River <hi>Orwel</hi> from <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> empty themſelves here; and the Chanels of both are large and deep, and ſafe for all Weathers; and where they join, they make a large Bay, or Road, able to receive the biggeſt Ships of War, and the greateſt Number that ever the World ſaw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. In the <hi>Dutch</hi> War, great Uſe was made of this Harbour; and there have been 100 Sail of Men of War with their Attendants, and between 3 and 400 Sail of Colliers, all riding in it at a time, with great Safety and Convenience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harwich</hi> is the Port where the Packet-boats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> go out and come in: the Inhabitants are far from being famed for good Uſage to Strangers, but on the contrary, are eſteemed a little extravagant in their Reckonings, in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-houſes; this has encouraged the ſetting up of Sloops, which they now call Paſſage-boats, to go directly from the River of <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>Holland:</hi> tho' the Paſſage may be ſomething longer, yet the Maſters of the Sloops are ſaid to be more obliging to Paſſengers, and more reaſonable in the Expence, and the Veſſels good Sea-boats. <hi>Harwich</hi> has been a Sufferer on this Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0141100401:24"/>The People of <hi>Harwich</hi> boaſt, that their Town is walled, and their Streets paved with Clay, and yet that one is as ſtrong, and the other as clean, as thoſe that are built or paved with Stone. The Fact is indeed true; for there is a ſort of Clay in the Cliff, between the Town and the Beacon-hill adjoining, which, when it falls down into the Sea, where it is beaten with the Waves and the Weather, turns gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually into Stone. But the chief Reaſon aſſigned is from the Water of a certain Spring or Well, which riſing in the Cliff, runs down into the Sea among thoſe Pieces of Clay, and petrifies them as it runs; and the Force of the Sea often ſtirring, and perhaps turning the Lumps of Clay, when Storms of Wind may give Force enough to the Water, cauſes them to harden every-where alike; otherwiſe thoſe which were not quite ſunk in the Water of the Spring, would be petrify'd but in part. Theſe Stones are gathered up to pave the Streets, and build the Houſes, and are indeed very hard. 'Tis alſo remarkable, that ſome of them, taken up before they are thoroughly petrify'd, will, upon breaking them, appear to be hard as a Stone without, and ſoft as Clay in the Middle; whereas others, that have lain a due time, ſhall be thorough Stone to the Centre, and full as hard within as without. The ſame Spring is ſaid to turn Wood into Iron: but this I take to be no more or leſs than the Quality, which (as I mentioned of the Shore at the <hi>Neſs</hi>) is found to be in much of the Stone along this Shore, of the Copperas Kind: and 'tis certain, that the <hi>Copperas-ſtone</hi> (ſo called) is found in all that Cliff, and even where the Water of this Spring has run; and I preſume, that thoſe who call the hardened Pieces of Wood, which they take out of this Well, by the Name of Iron, never tried the Quality of it with the Fire or Hammer; if they had, it is not unlikely, that they would have given ſome other Account of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0141100401:25"/>On the Promontory of Land, which they call <hi>Beacon-hill,</hi> which lies beyond or behind the Town, toward the Sea, is a Light-houſe, to give the Ships Direction in their ſailing by, as well as their coming into the Harbour at Night.</p>
            <p>This Town was formerly fortify'd; but in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Fortifications were demoliſhed. It has ſince been ordered to be fortify'd again, and Ground has been bought accordingly, to the King's Uſe, by Act of Parliament: but there is nothing more done in it yet; and indeed it is many Years ſince the Government, having a better Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Shipping, have had Occaſion to fortify Towns to the Landward.</p>
            <p>It was incorporated in the 13th of <hi>Edward</hi> II. The <hi>Harwich</hi> Men pretended a Grant from <hi>Edw.</hi> III. to take Cuſtom-duties for Goods coming into the Haven, till on a Complaint made by the Town of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> that it was an Infringement upon their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, an Inquiſition was appointed by that Prince at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in the 14th of his Reign, by which it was determined againſt <hi>Harwich,</hi> in favour of <hi>Ipſwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harwich,</hi> after all, may be ſaid to be a neat, clean, well-built Town, enjoys a good Maritime Trade, is governed by a Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> has a Market every <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> and two annual Fairs, one on <hi>May-day,</hi> the other on <hi>October</hi> the 18th.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Landguard-fort</hi> was built in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> I. and was a much more conſiderable Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication than at preſent; having had four Baſtions, named the <hi>King's,</hi> the <hi>Queen's, Holland's,</hi> and <hi>Warwick's,</hi> mounted with 60 very large Guns, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe on the Royal <hi>Baſtion,</hi> where the King's Standard was diſplay'd, which would throw a 28 Pound Ball over <hi>Harwich</hi>; and it had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Gariſon, with a Chapel and many Houſes, for the Governor, Gunners, and other Officers. But it has been demoliſhed, and a ſmall Platform made inſtead
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0141100401:26"/>
of it by the Water-ſide; but yet, as the particular Current of the Chanel, which Ships muſt keep in, as I have ſaid, obliges them to paſs juſt by the Fort, the Harbour is ſufficiently defended on the Sea-ſide from ſudden Invaſion.</p>
            <p>And now, being at the Extremity of the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> of which I have given you ſome View, as to that Side next the Sea only; I ſhall conclude this Part of my Circuit, by telling you, that I will take the Towns which lie more towards the Centre of the County, in my Return by the North and Weſt Part, that I may give you a few Hints of ſome Towns which were near me in my Rout this way.</p>
            <p>On the Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> before I came into it at <hi>Witham,</hi> lie four good Market-towns at near equal Diſtance from one another; <hi>viz. Rumford, Brentwood, Ingatſtone,</hi> and <hi>Chelmsford. Rumford</hi> ſtands firſt, and is noted for two Markets, one for Calves and Hogs, the other for Corn and other Proviſions, moſtly bought up for <hi>London</hi> Market.</p>
            <p>At the farther End of this Town, in the Middle of a ſtately Park, ſtood <hi>Guldy-hall,</hi> vulgarly <hi>Giddy-hall,</hi> an antient Seat of one Sir <hi>Thomas Coke,</hi> Lord-Mayor of <hi>London Anno</hi> 1462. in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. whoſe great Riches being his principal Crime, expoſed him in bad Times to ſo great Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, that tho' he was acquitted, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of his Judge, of the Crimes laid to his Charge, yet he was fined to the Value very nearly of his whole Eſtate. It is ſince pulled down to the Ground, and there now ſtands a ſtately Manſion-houſe, built upon the Spot by Sir <hi>John Eyles,</hi> lately Lord-Mayor of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brentwood</hi> and <hi>Ingatſtone</hi> are two others, and are large thorough-fare Towns, full of good Inns, chiefly maintained by the Multitude of Carriers and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0141100401:27"/>
Paſſengers, conſtantly paſſing this Way to <hi>London,</hi> with Droves of Cattle, Proviſions and Manufactures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chelmsford</hi> is the 4th, chiefly ſupported by the fame Buſineſs. It is the County-town, where the Aſſizes are often held, and ſtands on the Conflux of two Rivers, the <hi>Chelmer,</hi> whence the Town derives its Name, and the <hi>Cann</hi>; and has a good Free-ſchool belonging to it.</p>
            <p>South-eaſt of <hi>Brentwood</hi> lies <hi>Billiricay,</hi> a pretty conſiderable Market-town.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Chelmsford</hi> ſtands a Seat of the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the Earl of <hi>Fitzwalter,</hi> which is ſeen on the Left-hand of the Road, juſt before you enter the Town. The Houſe is large, and hath been lately new fronted, ſo that it makes a handſome Appearance. There are alſo ſeveral new Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about it, and in time, if his Lordſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues his Deſign of improving it, it will become a fine Seat.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take notice, in my Return through theſe Parts, of the noble Seat of the Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> and his Lordſhip's great Improvements in this County.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Lees,</hi> or <hi>Lee's-Priory,</hi> as ſome call it, is to be ſeen an antient Houſe, in the Middle of a beautiful Park, formerly the Seat of the Duke of <hi>Mancheſter</hi>; but after the Death of the Duke it was ſold to the Ducheſs Dowager of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and ſince purchaſed by Mr. <hi>Hoare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Five Market-towns fill up the reſt of this Part of the Country; <hi>Dunmow, Braintree, Thaxted, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> and <hi>Coggſhall</hi>; all noted for the Manufacture of Bays. But <hi>Dunmow</hi> I muſt particularly mention, on account of its famous old Story of its Flitch of Bacon; which is this:</p>
            <p>One <hi>Robert Fitzwalter,</hi> a powerful Baron in this County, in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> III. inſtituted a Cuſtom in the Priory here; That <hi>whatever married Man did not repent of his being married, or differ and</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0141100401:28"/>
               <hi>diſpute with his Wife within a Year and a Day after his Marriage, and would ſwear to the Truth of it, kneeling upon two hard pointed Stones in the</hi> Priory Church-yard, <hi>ſet up for that Purpoſe, in Preſence of the Prior and Convent, ſuch Perſon ſhould have a Flitch of Bacon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This has been actually claimed and received, as appears by Record there; but the Priory being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, there is an End of the Flitch; and it were well, if no worſe Conſequence had attended the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Religious Houſes. For as there was no Danger of many Claimants, there were the fewer to regret the Loſs.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Braintree</hi> and <hi>Bocking</hi> I ſhall take notice in my Return to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Formerly, 'tis thought, the Foreſts of <hi>Epping</hi> and <hi>Henault</hi> took up all the South Part of the County; but particularly we are aſſured, that it reached to the River <hi>Chelmer,</hi> and into <hi>Dengy</hi> Hundred; and from thence again Weſt to <hi>Epping</hi> and <hi>Waltham,</hi> where it continues to be a Foreſt ſtill.</p>
            <p>Probably that of <hi>Epping</hi> has been a Weald or Foreſt ever ſince this Iſland has been inhabited, and may ſhew us, in ſome Parts of it, <hi>where Incloſures and Tillage have not broke in upon it,</hi> what the general Face of this Iſland was, before the <hi>Romans</hi> landed in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſtitution of this Foreſt is beſt ſeen, as to its Antiquity, by the pleaſant Grant of it from <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, to <hi>Randolph Peperking,</hi> one of his Favourites, who was after called <hi>Peverell,</hi> and whoſe Name remains ſtill in ſeveral Villages in this County; as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of <hi>Hatfield Peverell,</hi> in the Road from <hi>Chelmsford</hi> to <hi>Witham,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to be originally a Park (called a Field in thoſe Days); and <hi>Hartfield</hi> may be as much as to ſay, a Park for Deer; for the Stags were in thoſe Days called <hi>Harts</hi>;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0141100401:29"/>
ſo that this was neither more nor leſs than <hi>Randolph Peperking</hi>'s <hi>Hart-field,</hi> or <hi>Deer-park.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Randolph</hi> or <hi>Ralph Peverell</hi> had, it ſeems, a beautiful Lady to his Wife, who was Daughter of <hi>Ingelrick,</hi> one of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi>'s Noblemen: He had two Sons by her, <hi>William Peverell,</hi> a famed Soldier, and Lord or Governor of <hi>Dover-caſtle</hi>; which he ſurrendered to <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> after the Battle in <hi>Suſſex</hi>; and <hi>Pain Peverell,</hi> his youngeſt, who was Lord of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> When the eldeſt Son delivered up the Caſtle, the Lady above-named was there; and the Conqueror fell in Love with her, and had a Son by her, who was called <hi>William,</hi> after the Conqueror's Chriſtian Name, but retained the Name of <hi>Peverell,</hi> and was afterwards, as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory acquaints us, created by the Conqueror Lord of <hi>Nottingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Lady, as is ſuppoſed, by way of Penance for her Frailty, founded a Nunnery at the Village of <hi>Hatfield-Peverell,</hi> mentioned above, where ſhe lies buried in the Pariſh-church, and her Memory is preſerved by a Tombſtone under one of the Windows. The Grant I have mentioned being to be found in <hi>Camden,</hi> I ſhall not tranſcribe it here.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now, in purſuance of my firſt Deſign, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the County of <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Harwich</hi> therefore, having a mind to view the Harbour, I ſent my Horſes round by <hi>Maning-tree,</hi> a good, but dirty Market-town, where there is a Timber-bridge over the <hi>Stour,</hi> or, as it is more uſually called, <hi>Maningtree-water</hi>; and took a Boat for <hi>Ipſwich</hi> up the River <hi>Orwel,</hi> known beſt by the Name of <hi>Ipſwich-water,</hi> by which Paſſage from <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> to <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> it is about twelve Miles.</p>
            <p>In a Creek in this River called <hi>Lavington-creek,</hi> we ſaw at low Water ſuch Shoals of Muſcles, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> great Boats might have loaded with them and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0141100401:30"/>
Quantity ſcarce diminiſhed to the Eye. Near this Creek Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton</hi> had a fine Seat, as alſo a Decoy for wild Ducks, and a very noble Eſtate; but it is divided into many Branches ſince his Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ipſwich</hi> is ſeated at the Diſtance of 12 Miles from <hi>Harwich,</hi> upon the Edge of the River, which take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſhort Turn to the Weſt, the Town forms there a kind of Semi-circle, or Half-moon, upon the Bank of the River. It is very remarkable, that tho' Ships of 500 Tuns may upon a Spring-tide come up very near this Town, and many Ships of that Burden have been built there; yet the River is ſcarce navigable above the Town, not even for the ſmalleſt Boats; nor does the Tide, which riſes ſometimes 13 or 14 Feet, and gives them 24 Feet Water very near the Town, flow much farther up the River than the Town.</p>
            <p>No Place in <hi>Britain</hi> is qualified like <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> for carrying on the <hi>Greenland</hi> Fiſhery; whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Cheapneſs of building and fitting out their Ships and Shalloops; furniſhing, victualling, and providing them with all kind of Stores; Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for laying up the Ships after the Voyage; Room for erecting their Magazines, Ware-houſes, Roap-walks, Cooperages, <hi>&amp;e.</hi> on the eaſieſt Terms; and eſpecially for the noiſome Cookery, which attends the boiling their Blubber, which may be on this River, remote from any Places of Reſort: then the Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Market for the Oil, when it is made, and, which above all ought to be regarded, the Conveniency that ariſes from this Conſideration, that the ſame Wind which carries them from the Mouth of the Haven, is fair to the very Seas of <hi>Greenland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ipſwich</hi> was formerly much more conſiderable for Trade than at preſent; but yet it may be accounted a very neat and well-built Town, and much larger than many Cities; carries on ſtill a conſiderable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0141100401:31"/>
Trade; and tho' it is but thinly inhabited, to what it has been, yet whoever looks into the Churches and Meeting-houſes of a <hi>Sunday,</hi> will not, even in this Particular, think ſo meanly of it as ſome have done.</p>
            <p>It has a very ſpacious Market-place; in the midſt of that is a fair Croſs, in which is the Corn-market. Adjoining is the Shambles or Butchery, very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and vulgarly, but erroneouſly, ſuppoſed to have been built by Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi>; for it owes its Original to a much later Date, <hi>viz.</hi> to the 40th Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Behind this is the Herb-market, and in a ſpacious Street a little diſtant, is a Market for Butter, Poultry, and other Country Proviſions, and another for Fiſh, with which the Town is ſerved in great Plenty. It has five Market-days weekly; <hi>Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday</hi> for ſmall Meat; <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> for Fiſh; and <hi>Saturday</hi> for all ſorts of Proviſions. It has alſo five annual Fairs; one on <hi>April</hi> 23. one on <hi>May</hi> 7. and 8. one on <hi>July</hi> 25. one on the 11th and 12th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> for Cattle alſo; and the fifth on <hi>September</hi> 14. which is a very conſiderable one for Butter and Cheeſe, to which the whole Country round reſort, to furniſh themſelves with Winter Stores; as do alſo many of the <hi>London</hi> Dealers in thoſe Commodities, who, however, are not ſuffered to buy till after the firſt three Days of the Fair.</p>
            <p>There are even now in this Town 12 Pariſh-churches, out of 14, which there once were; and two Chapels in the Corporation-liberty, out of ſeveral which have been demoliſhed, beſides Meeting-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it once abounded with Religious Houſes, which have yielded to the Fate of the Times.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo a fair Town-hall, with a ſpacious Council-chamber, and other commodious Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; a Shire-hall, where the County Seſſions are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0141100401:32"/>
held for the Diviſion of <hi>Ipſwich</hi>; a large publick Library, adjoining to a noble Hoſpital founded by the Town, called <hi>Chriſt's Hoſpital,</hi> for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Poor Children, old Perſons, Maniacks; and in it Rogues, Vagabonds, and ſturdy Beggars, are kept to hard Labour. Alſo adjoining to this is a good Free-ſchool; and there is likewiſe the noble Foundation of Mr. <hi>Henry Tooly, Anno</hi> 1556, for poor old Men and Women.</p>
            <p>It is a Town Corporate, governed by two Bailiffs, a Recorder, 12 Portmen, four of which, beſides the Bailiffs, are Juſtices of the Peace, two Coroners, 24 Common-council-men, who are alſo High-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, and 12 of them Headboroughs, and 15 Petty Conſtables.</p>
            <p>Its Privileges are extraordinary; for the Bailiffs paſs Fines and Recoveries, hear and determine Cauſes, as well Criminal as Civil, ariſing in the Town, and even Crown Cauſes, preferably to any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> They appoint the Aſſize of Bread, Wine, Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No Freeman can be obliged to ſerve on Juries out of the Town, or bear any Offices for the King, without his own Conſent, Sheriffs for the County excepted. Nor are they obliged to pay any Tolls or Duties in any other Parts of the Kingdom, having caſt the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in a Trial at Law for Duties demanded by the City of Freemens Ships, in the River <hi>Thames.</hi> They are intitled to all Waifs, Eſtrays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to all Goods caſt on Shore within their Admiralty-Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which extends on the Coaſt of <hi>Eſſex</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Harwich,</hi> and on both Sides the <hi>Suffolk</hi> Coaſt; and their Bailiffs even hold their Admiralty-court beyond <hi>Landguard</hi> Fort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by a ſolemn Deciſion in their Favour by an Inquiſition taken at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> in the 14th of <hi>Edward</hi> III. they carried the Point, which <hi>Harwich</hi> conteſted with them, of taking Cuſtom-duties for Goods coming into <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>

Haven, which was determined to belong ſolely to the Bailiffs and Burgeſſes of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> as I before hinted. In King <hi>John</hi>'s Reign, there was a Mint in this Town.</p>
            <p>I ſhall juſt mention, in this Place, tho' it be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, that the famous Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> was born in this Town, his Father being a Butcher in it, tho', according to Dr. <hi>Fiddes,</hi> who publiſhed his Will, he ſeems to have been a Man of Subſtance for thoſe Times. This Prelate roſe to the higheſt Pitch of Honour and Grandeur, that it was poſſible for a Subject to attain to, and was ſuddenly ſtripped of all, having been caſt in a Praemunire, whereby he incurr'd a Forfeiture of all his Effects and Preferments; and being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards pardoned and reſtored to ſome Part thereof, particularly to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>York,</hi> he was arreſted for High-Treaſon at his Archiepiſcopal Palace at <hi>Cawood</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>; and died at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Abbey, as he was carrying to <hi>London,</hi> where he was buried.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Refugees, when they firſt came over to <hi>England</hi> began a little to take to this Place; and ſome Merchants attempted to ſet up a Linen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture in their Favour; but it did not meet with the expected Succeſs, and at preſent I find very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it. The poor People are however employ'd, as they are all over thoſe Counties, in ſpinning Wooll for other Towns where Manufactures are ſettled.</p>
            <p>The Country round <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> as are all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo near the Coaſt, is applied chiefly to Corn, of which a very great Quantity is continually ſhipped off for <hi>London</hi>; and ſometimes they load Corn here for <hi>Holland,</hi> eſpecially if the Market abroad is encouraging.</p>
            <p>There is a great deal of very good Company in this Town; and tho' here are not ſo many of the Gentry as at <hi>Bury,</hi> yet it has more than any other Town in the County.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0141100401:34"/>I take this Town to be one of the moſt agreeable Places in <hi>England,</hi> for Families who have lived well, but may be reduced to live within a narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; for

            <p>The Lord Viſcount <hi>Hereford</hi> had a very fine Seat and Park in this Town; the Houſe indeed was built in the antient Taſte, but very commodious; 'tis called <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> and had been a Priory, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſe, in former Times.

            <p>The Country round <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> is an inexhauſtible Store-houſe of Timber; of which, now their Trade of building Ships is abated, they ſend very great Quantities to the King's Building-yards at <hi>Chatham</hi>; which by Water is ſo little a Way, that they often run to it from the Mouth of the River at <hi>Harwich</hi> in one Tide.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit in this Place the following Account of an excellent Charity for the Relief and Support of the Widows and Orphans of poor Clergymen of the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which was begun in the Year 1704. by a voluntary Subſcription of a ſmall Number of Gentlemen and Clergy, in and about <hi>Ipſwich</hi> and <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> and has ſince that Time been carried on with ſuch great Succeſs, that the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0141100401:35"/>
yearly Collection, which in 1704. was but 6<hi>l.</hi> by gradual Advances every Year, amounted in the Year 1740. to 312<hi>l.</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> and in the Whole 37 Years to the Sum of 4416<hi>l.</hi> 9<hi>s.</hi> 9<hi>d.</hi>

            <p>Beſides the yearly Subſcriptions, there have been divers Gifts and Legacies given to the ſaid Society, to the Uſes above-mentioned, to the Amount of 554<hi>l.</hi> 17<hi>s.</hi> So much of which is laid out in <hi>South-Sea</hi> Annuities, and kept for raiſing a capital Stock for the general Benefit of the Charity; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ariſing from it hath been, and ſtill is, every Year applied to the Relief and Support of the ſaid Widows and Orphans, that they may not mourn without a Comforter, and that the Sons and Daughters of the poor Clergy intitled to this Relief, may not be ſuffered to wander as Vagabonds up and down the Earth, expoſed to thoſe Miſeries and Temptations which attend upon extreme Poverty.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Ipſwich</hi> I took a Turn to <hi>Hadley,</hi> famous for the Martyrdom of Dr. <hi>Rowland Taylor,</hi> who was burnt at <hi>Aldham Common, Anno</hi> 1555. On the Place where he was martyr'd, I obſerved a Stone, with this Inſcription:

            <p>It has been a Town Corporate, governed by a Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> being brought againſt their Charter, in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> II. it has not been renewed ſince. Here are two weekly Markets, and two annual Fairs. It deals much in Corn, and abounds with all manner of Proviſions. The Town is large, and tolerably well built; but being in a Bottom, is generally dirty. Its Church is a very handſome Building, graced with a Spire Steeple, and being near the Middle of the Town, is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0141100401:36"/>
an Ornament to it. 'Tis of ſome Note ſtill for the Manufacture of Woollen Cloths, but not ſo much as formerly.</p>
            <p>A little to the South-weſt lies <hi>Neyland,</hi> a large Market-town, in a Bottom; upon the <hi>Stour</hi>; over which is a very good Bridge. The Bays-trade is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on here too.</p>
            <p>Higher up to the North-weſt, upon the ſame River, ſtands <hi>Sudbury,</hi> ſituate on the <hi>Stour</hi>; which is now made navigable for Barges from <hi>Maningtree</hi> hither, and gives a great Addition to their Trade. It is a very antient Town, governed by a Mayor, and at preſent conſiſts of three diſtinct Pariſhes, which have each a handſome and large Church; the Names of which are <hi>St. Gregory</hi>'s, <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s, and <hi>All-Saints</hi>; tho' <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s is rather a Chapel of Eaſe to <hi>St. Gregory</hi>'s. This Town is pretty well built, but the Streets, being unpaved, are dirty. It has an handſome Bridge over the <hi>Stour,</hi> leading into <hi>Eſſex.</hi> This Town was one of the firſt Places where King <hi>Edward</hi> III. placed the <hi>Flemings,</hi> whom he allured hither to teach the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Art of manufacturing their own Wool, of which before they knew nothing; and here the Woollen Trade hath continued ever ſince in a flouriſhing Way. The Inhabitants at preſent employ themſelves in making Says, Perpetuanas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Simon Theobald,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Sudbury,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> tranſlated thither from <hi>London Anno</hi> 1375. was a Native of this Town. He was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the Inſtigation of one <hi>John Ball,</hi> a ſeditious and fanatical Preacher in <hi>Wat Tyler</hi>'s Rebellion. He was a Prelate of very good Character for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Charity. He built the Upper-end of <hi>St. Gregory</hi>'s Church in <hi>Sudbury,</hi> where his Head is ſtill ſhewn: it was, not long ſince, intire, covered with the Fleſh and Skin dried by Art, the Mouth wide open, occaſioned by Convulſions thro' the hard
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0141100401:37"/>
Death he died, having ſuffered eight Blows before his Head was cut off. He founded in the Place where his Father's Houſe ſtood, a neat College, which he furniſhed with Secular Prieſts, and other Miniſters, and likewiſe endowed it bountifully.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Sudbury</hi> is <hi>Melford,</hi> a pleaſant Village, and perhaps the largeſt in <hi>England,</hi> being about a Mile in Length. The Church is a very fine Edifice, and ſtands at the North-end of it. There were two Chantries in it. <hi>Weaver</hi> ſays, That on ſome Part of the Outſide of the Church are theſe Words: <hi>Pray for the Souls of</hi> John Clopton, <hi>and</hi> Richard Boteler, <hi>of whoſe Goodys this Chapel was built</hi>; and that ſeveral of the antient Family of <hi>Clopton</hi> are there buried. This Town has given two Lord Mayors to <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>John Milburn,</hi> Draper, in 1521. and Sir <hi>Roger Martin,</hi> Mercer, in 1567. It has an annual Fair, divers good Inns, many handſome Houſes, and creditable Inhabitants. Here lived the unhappy Mr. <hi>Drew,</hi> who in the Year 1739. was barbarouſly murdered; and his Son, Mr. <hi>Charles Drew,</hi> executed for it, who effected it either with his own Hands, or by thoſe of another Perſon, whom he procured to do it, for the ſake of enjoying his Eſtate. The Parricide was attended with Circumſtances of great Horror; but the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars being well known, and the Fact ſo recent, I ſhall not ſay any more of it here.</p>
            <p>In my Way from hence to <hi>St. Edmond's-bury,</hi> I paſſed due North thro' <hi>Lavenham,</hi> or <hi>Lanham,</hi> a pretty good Town, ſtanding upon a Branch of the River <hi>Breton.</hi> It has a ſpacious Market-place, which was formerly of much better Account than at preſent. It had many Years ago great Advantage from its Trade in Blue Cloths; but tho' this is loſt, yet it has a good Trade for Serges, Shalloons, Says, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made here; ſpins a great deal of fine Yarn for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and has of late flouriſhed much, by ſetting up
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0141100401:38"/>
a Hall for ſelling Wool, the Town being conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſituated for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Church and Steeple here are juſtly accounted the fineſt in the County. It is ſituate on a Hill on the Weſt-ſide of the Town, the Steeple being 137 Feet high. It has Six tuneable Bells in it, and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants boaſt much of their Tenor, which, they ſay, out-does all the Bells in <hi>England</hi> for its deep Note; and tho' it weighs but 23 Hundred Weight, they ſay it ſounds like a Bell of 40 Hundred. This Town is alſo remarkable for the many charitable Bequeſts made to its Poor; and gave <hi>London</hi> a Lord Mayor in 1462. in the Perſon of Sir <hi>Thomas Cooke,</hi> Draper, the Son of <hi>Robert Cooke</hi> of this Town.</p>
            <p>Eaſt of <hi>Lavenham,</hi> and pretty near it, is <hi>Bildeſton,</hi> a Market-town, noted for the Cloathing-trade, its good Church, its mean Buildings, and Dirtineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bury St. Edmunds</hi> is ſituate on the Weſt-ſide of the River <hi>Lach,</hi> which within theſe few Years has been made navigable from <hi>Lynn</hi> to <hi>Fornham,</hi> a Mile North of the Town. It is ſo regularly built, that almoſt all the Streets cut one another at Right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. It ſtands on an eaſy Aſcent, and overlooks a moſt fruitful incloſed Country on the South and South-weſt; on the North and North-weſt the moſt delightful champain Fields, which extend themſelves to <hi>Lynn,</hi> and that Part of the <hi>Norfolk</hi> Coaſt; and on the Eaſt the Country is partly incloſed, and partly open. No wonder then that it is called the <hi>Montpellier</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and even of <hi>England:</hi> and indeed a certain antient Author ſays no more than it deſerves;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the Sun ſhines not upon a Town more agreeable in its Situation."</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is governed by an Alderman, which is their chief Magiſtrate, a Recorder, 12 capital Burgeſſes, and 24 common Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>It has two plentiful weekly Markets on <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays</hi>; and three annual Fairs; one three
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0141100401:39"/>
Days before and three Days after the Feaſt of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>; and it is generally protracted to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Length, for the Diverſion of the Nobility and Gentry that reſort to it, in great Numbers.</p>
            <p>The Abbey, once ſo famous, was firſt built of Wood by <hi>Sigebert</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> ſoon after Chriſtianity was planted here; and when finiſhed, about the Year 638, that King retired into it, and ſhut himſelf up from the World.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edmund,</hi> from whom the Town takes its Name, began to reign over the <hi>Eaſt-Angles Anno</hi> 855, in the 14th Year of his Age, and reigned 15 Years; being killed <hi>Anno</hi> 870, as ſuppoſed, at <hi>Hoxne,</hi> at 29 Years old, and his Corps was 33 Years after removed to <hi>Bury.</hi> The Abbey being much enriched thereby, the Monks, who were of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order, found means, about the Year 1020, to get it intirely to themſelves, excluding the Seculars; and King <hi>Canute,</hi> in the 4th Year of his Reign, founded a more magnificent Church, in Honour of St. <hi>Edmund,</hi> which was finiſhed in 12 Years, and dedicated to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> St. <hi>Mary,</hi> and St. <hi>Edmund.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uvius,</hi> Prior of <hi>Hulm,</hi> who was conſecrated the firſt Abbot, <hi>Anno</hi> 1020, got the Abbey exempted from Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, and encompaſſed that and the Town with a Wall and Ditch; the Ruins of which, in ſeveral Places, are ſtill to be ſeen: and the Abbots afterwards were made Parliamentary Barons. But in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. it run the common Fate of all Religious Houſes, and that Prince put an End to all its Glory.</p>
            <p>When the Abbey was in its Proſperity, there was a Chapel at every one of the five Gates, and the Town abounded with Chapels and Oratories. 'Tis poſſible theſe might be Hoſpitals; for there was an Hoſpital of <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s without <hi>Riſhy gate</hi>; an Hoſpital of <hi>St. Saviour</hi>'s without <hi>North-gate</hi>; an
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0141100401:40"/>
Hoſpital of <hi>St. Nicolas</hi> at or near <hi>Eaſt-gate</hi>; and <hi>God's-houſe,</hi> or <hi>St. John</hi>'s, at the <hi>South-gate</hi>; a College of Prieſts with a Gild to the <hi>Holy</hi> or <hi>Sweet Name of Jeſus,</hi> the Situation of which I could not find; and an Houſe of <hi>Grey Friers</hi> at <hi>Babwell,</hi> or the <hi>Toll-gate.</hi> But at this time there are only two Churches, which indeed are very beautiful and ſtately, and ſtand in the ſame Church-yard; the one dedicated to St. <hi>Mary,</hi> the other, built in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. to St. <hi>James.</hi> The latter has a convenient Library; and at the Weſt End of the South Iſle are interred <hi>James Reynolds,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> late Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and his Lady, to whoſe Memories two large Monuments are erected. The Church of <hi>St. Mary</hi> has, on the North-ſide of the Altar, (to which we approach by a fine Aſcent of Six Steps) the Tomb of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and Wife to <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> Her Coffin is of Lead, and has this Inſcription on it; <hi>Mary Queen,</hi> 1533. <hi>of France. Edmund H----.</hi> There are other hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Monuments in this Church.</p>
            <p>The other moſt remarkable publick Buildings are the Abbey-gate, which is ſtill a fine Monument of what the Abbey once was; the Guild hall; the Wool-hall; the Shire-houſe; the Market-croſs; and the Grammar-School, endowed by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> VI.</p>
            <p>Such as is the Town for Situation, is the Neighbourhood and Gentry about it for Politeneſs; and no Place glories in brighter Ladies, or better Families.</p>
            <p>In the Path-way between the two Churches it was that <hi>Arundel Coke,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Barriſter at Law, in the Year 1721. attempted (with the Aſſiſtance of one <hi>Woodbourne,</hi> a barbarous Aſſaſſin) an unheard-of Outrage on his Brother-in-law, <hi>Edward Criſ,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for the ſake of poſſeſſing what he had. He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0141100401:41"/>
him, his Wife and Family, to Supper with him; and in the Night, on Pretence of going to ſee a Friend to them both, he led him into the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, when, on a Signal he gave, the Aſſaſſin made at Mr. <hi>Criſp</hi> with a Hedge-bill, and in a moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible manner mangled his Head and Face; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him dead, there left him; and <hi>Coke</hi> returned, as if he knew nothing of the Matter, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But it happening that Mr. <hi>Criſp</hi> was not killed, and coming back to <hi>Coke</hi>'s Houſe to the Company all bloody, and cruelly mangled, the ſhocking Sight amazed and confounded them all; <hi>Coke,</hi> that he was not dead; the reſt, that he had met with ſo ſtrange a Diſaſter. Mr. <hi>Criſp</hi> has ſurvived this Outrage many Years, and <hi>Coke</hi> and <hi>Woodburne,</hi> the hired Aſſaſſin, were juſtly executed for a Villainy ſo deteſtable, that it hardly had its Parallel. The Gentleman being not killed, the Aſſaſſins were tried and condemned on the Statute for defacing and diſmembring, called <hi>The Coventry Act:</hi> And <hi>Coke</hi> was ſo <hi>good</hi> a Lawyer, and ſo <hi>hardened</hi> a Wretch, that he thought to have ſaved himſelf, by pleading that he intended not to <hi>deface,</hi> but to <hi>kill.</hi> Some nice People ſay, the Law was a little ſtrained in their Puniſhment, as the Gentleman recovered; but, ſurely, if in any Caſe the <hi>Letter</hi> might be diſpenſed with, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> be brought in Aid of it, it was right in this: and it would have been next to a national Diſgrace, not to have a Law that would reach ſo flagrant and complicated a Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>There is very little or no Manufacturing in this Town, except Spinning; the chief Buſineſs of the Place depending upon the neighbouring Gentry, who cannot fail to cauſe Trade enough by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their Families and Equipages, among the People of a Country Town. Our Monarchs, <hi>Edward</hi> I. and II. had a Mint at <hi>Bury,</hi> and ſome of their Pennies coined there, are yet remaining.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0141100401:42"/>
               <hi>Stow,</hi> in his Survey of <hi>London, p.</hi> 83. ſays, That here was alſo a Mint in King <hi>John</hi>'s Time.</p>
            <p>This Town is famous for two great Events: One, That a Parliament was held here in the Year 1447. in the 25th Year of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. The other, That at the Meeting of this Parliament, the good <hi>Humphry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> Regent of the Kingdom, during the Abſence of King <hi>Henry</hi> V. and in the Minority of his Son <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and, to his laſt Hour, the Safeguard of the whole Nation, and Darling of the People, was baſely murdered here; by whoſe Death the Gate was opened to that dreadful War between the Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> which ended in the Confuſion of the very Race, who are ſuppoſed to have contrived that Murder.</p>
            <p>As I made ſome Stay at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> and <hi>Bury,</hi> being obliged to wait the Leiſure of a Gentleman who accompanied me Part of this Journey, I made ſeveral Excurſions more Inland than I had at firſt intended when I ſet out, and viſited the following Towns:</p>
            <p>As, firſt, <hi>Boxford,</hi> which is about Seven Miles from <hi>Sudbury,</hi> and is a neat and well-built Village, and carries on a conſiderable Traffick.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Bures</hi> on the <hi>Stour</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> was crown'd, and not at <hi>Bury.</hi> It has a good Bridge on that River. <hi>Anno</hi> 1733. the Spire of the Steeple of the handſome Church here was burnt by Lightning, the Bell-frames deſtroyed, and the Bells melted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clare</hi> is ſituate on the <hi>Stour,</hi> about 14 Miles from <hi>Bury,</hi> and is but a poor Town, and dirty, the Streets being unpaved. But yet the Civil and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Courts are held at it, and it has a good Church; and ſhews ſtill the Ruins of a ſtrong Caſtle, and an old Monaſtery. It gives Title of Earl to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> of the <hi>Pelham</hi> Family, as it did to that of <hi>Holles</hi> before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0141100401:43"/>Not far from <hi>Clare</hi> is <hi>Honedon,</hi> where, in the Year 1687. the Sexton, digging a Grave, found a large Quantity of <hi>Saxon</hi> Coins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> upon the <hi>Stour</hi> deſerves Mention, for giving Name to the Noble Family of the Dukes of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>

               <hi>Haverhill</hi> ſtands partly in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and partly in <hi>Suffolk.</hi> By the Ruins of a Church and Caſtle ſtill to be ſeen here, it appears to have been of greater Conſequence formerly, than at preſent. Now I am at this Place, I ſhall juſt mention</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ledgate,</hi> on account of its giving Birth and Name to the famous Poet, Orator, Mathematician and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, <hi>John Ledgate,</hi> who died in 1440. Here are to be ſeen the Ruins of a ſtrong Caſtle.</p>

               <hi>Eaſterbergholt,</hi> near four Miles from <hi>Stratford,</hi> and half a Mile North of the <hi>Stour,</hi> is a large and handſome Village, employ'd in the Woollen Way, but not to ſo great a Degree as formerly. It has a good Church, but the Steeple is in Ruins, and the Bells are rung by Hand, in a kind of Cage ſet up in the Church-yard. A little South of the Church is an elegant Houſe of Sir <hi>Joſeph Hankey,</hi> Alderman of <hi>London.</hi>

               <hi>Hemingſton</hi> may bear the Mention for the merry Tenure by which that Manor was held, according to <hi>Camden,</hi> by Serjeanty, the Poſſeſſor being obliged every <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> to perform before the King one <hi>Saltus,</hi> one <hi>Sufflatus,</hi> and one <hi>Bombulus</hi>: or, as is

               <hi>Needham</hi> is a thorough-fare Town, about nine Miles North-weſt from <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> It is tolerably well built, has ſeveral conſiderable Dealers in it, and formerly carried on a large Trade in the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, which it has loſt for ſome Years.</p>

               <hi>Bildeſton</hi> is a meanly built, dirty Town, but has a good Church.</p>

            <p>And five Miles further, being eight from <hi>Bury,</hi> is <hi>Wulpit,</hi> famous for the white Bricks made there. It has a handſome Church and Spire-Steeple.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Norton,</hi> near <hi>Wulpit,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was induced to dig for Gold. He was diſappointed, but the Diggings are viſible at this Day.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Boteſdale</hi> is a long, mean-built, dirty, thorough-fare Town; yet it is remarkable for a Grammar Free-ſchool founded by Sir <hi>Nicolas Bacon,</hi> and eſtabliſhed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Maſter and Uſher are to be elected out of <hi>Bennet</hi> College <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where Sir <hi>Nicolas</hi> was educated.

               <hi>Milden-hall,</hi> about 12 Miles from <hi>Bury,</hi> is ſituate on the River <hi>Larke</hi>; it is a Town of very extenſive Limits, pleaſant and well-built, and has a noble Church, and lofty Steeple. It has a plentiful <hi>Friday</hi> Market, and a very conſiderable annual Fair, which laſts four Days. A little North of the Church is the Manſion-houſe of Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer,</hi> Bart. who in the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was Speaker of the Houſe of Commons. In the Year 1507. a great Part of this Town was conſumed by Fire. It furniſhed the City of <hi>London</hi> with two Lord Mayors, Sir <hi>Henry Barton,</hi> Skinner, <hi>Anno</hi> 1428. and Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Gregory,</hi> of the ſame Company, <hi>Anno</hi> 1451.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ickworth</hi> was once a Pariſh, but now is a noble Park, in which is the Seat of the Earl of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> It is a Place of great Antiquity, and what confirms it is, what that learned Antiquarian Dr. <hi>Battley,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> writes, That in his Memory a large Pot of <hi>Roman</hi> Money was found here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Debenham</hi> is a tolerably clean, tho' mean-built Town, and among very dirty and heavy Roads, being ſeated on a Hill. The Church is a good Building, the Market-place tolerable, and there is a Free-ſchool founded by Appointment of Sir <hi>Robert Hitcham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crows-hall,</hi> about a Mile South-eaſt of this Town, was formerly the Seat of the <hi>Gawdies</hi>; till Sir <hi>Charles Gawdy,</hi> Bart. convey'd it to <hi>John Pit,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Mendleſham</hi> is a dirty and poor Town, but has a handſome Church, and a ſmall <hi>Tueſday's</hi> Market.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eye</hi> is a Town Corporate, governed by two Bailiffs, ten principal Burgeſſes, and 24 Common-council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and gives Title of Baron to the Lord <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis.</hi> It is ſituate in a Bottom between two Rivers, is meanly built, and the Streets dirty.

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0141100401:46"/>My Friend having finiſhed his Buſineſs in thoſe Parts of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which lie round the Towns of <hi>Bury</hi> and <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> gave me an Opportunity of reſuming my Journey according to the Plan I laid down at the Beginning of the Letter; and ſo from the former of theſe Towns I returned by <hi>Stow-market,</hi> and <hi>Needham,</hi> to <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> that I might keep as near the Coaſt as was proper to my deſigned Circuit; having determined to take the Opportunity, which he told me his Affairs would give me, of making two or three Excurſions from <hi>Woodbridge, Aldborough,</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>would,</hi> to make my Obſervations on that Part of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which I have not yet touched upon. From <hi>Ipſwich</hi> therefore I went to viſit the Sea again, and ſo to <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Orford</hi> on the Sea Coaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Woodbridge</hi> is a Market-town, ſituate on the River <hi>Deben,</hi> about 11 Miles from the Sea. This River being navigable to the Town for Ships of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Burden, it drives a pretty good Trade with <hi>Holland, Newcaſtle,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and has Paſſage Hoys, that go to and return from <hi>London</hi> weekly. It has a fine Church and Steeple, and traded formerly in Sackcloth, and now in refining Salt. The Shire-hall is a handſome Pile of Building, where the Quarter-Seſſions for this Part of the County are held, and under it is the Corn-croſs. One Street in it, called <hi>Stone-ſtreet,</hi> is well-built and paved, but the reſt are dirty. The Market-place and Thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are alſo well enough built; but the reſt of the Town is mean. The Quays and Ware-houſes are very commodious, and here is a Grammar-ſchool, and an Alms-houſe, erected in 1587. by <hi>Thomas Seckford,</hi> Maſter of the Requeſts, for Thirteen Men and Three Women, which is well endowed. It has a pretty good Market on <hi>Wedneſdays,</hi> and two annual Fairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walton</hi> has been an antient Market-town, and tho' the Market is now diſuſed, the Croſs is ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0141100401:47"/>
In the neighbouring Pariſh of <hi>Felixſtow,</hi> on the Cliff by the Sea, and about a Mile from the <hi>Colne</hi> Side of <hi>Woodbridge-haven,</hi> are diſcerned the Ruins of a quadrangular Caſtle advantageouſly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; of which nothing now remains but the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of one Side of the Wall. The reſt has been devoured by the Sea; and in all Probability theſe Remains muſt in a few Years undergo the ſame Fate. It was built principally of Rock-ſtones; but the many <hi>Roman</hi> Bricks ſtill to be ſeen, and <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, which have been diſcovered among the Ruins of the Side Walls, as they have been waſhed away by the Sea in the preſent Age, are an undeniable Evidence, that it was a Place of conſiderable Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, probably a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, which might give Name to the Hundred of <hi>Colnies,</hi> in which it ſtood.</p>
            <p>Now begins that Part which is ordinarily called <hi>High-Suffolk</hi>; which being a rich Soil, is, for a long Way wholly employed in Dairies; and famous for the beſt Butter, and perhaps the worſt Cheeſe in <hi>England:</hi> the Butter is barrelled, and ſometimes pickled up in ſmall Caſks, in which it keeps ſo well, that I have know a Firkin of <hi>Suffolk</hi> Butter ſent to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and brought back to <hi>England</hi> again, perfectly good and ſweet, as at firſt.</p>
            <p>From hence turning down to the Shore, we ſee <hi>Orfordneſs,</hi> a noted Point of Land for the Guide of the Colliers and Coaſters, and a good Shelter for them to ride under, when a ſtrong North-eaſt Wind blows, and makes a foul Shore on the Coaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orford</hi> is ſituate on the North-weſt Side of the River <hi>Ore,</hi> whence it had its Name. It was formerly a Town of good Account, having a ſtrong Caſtle of reddiſh Stone for its Defence, of which, and of a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Nunnery near the Quay, there are ſtill to be ſeen conſiderable Ruins. The Sea has ſo much withdrawn itſelf from this Town, that it is robbed of its chief Advantage, and deſerves not the Name
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0141100401:48"/>
of a Harbour. The Town is mean, and no one contends for an Intereſt in it, but ſuch as want to make themſelves a Merit in the Choice of the two Members which it returns to Parliament. It is a Town Corporate, and is governed by a Mayor, eight Portmen, and twelve Burgeſſes; it has alſo a mean <hi>Monday</hi> Market, and an annual Fair. It had the Honour to give Title of Earl to the brave Admiral <hi>Ruſſel:</hi> but that is now extinct.</p>
            <p>About three Miles from <hi>Orford,</hi> is <hi>Aldburgh,</hi> a Town pleaſantly ſituated in a Valley. It has two Streets, each near a Mile long; but its Breadth, which was more conſiderable formerly, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, and the Sea has of late Years ſwallowed up one whole Street. The Town, tho' meanly built, is clean and well peopled in the Sea-faring way. The Sea waſhes the Eaſt-ſide of it, and the River <hi>Ald</hi> runs not far from the South-end of it, affording a good Quay. In the adjacent Seas, Sprats, Soles, and Lobſters, are caught in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. The Town trades to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> for Coals; and from hence Corn is tranſported. The Manor of <hi>Aldburgh,</hi> as alſo the Manors of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Taſkards</hi> in the Neighbourhood, formerly belonged to the Monaſtery of <hi>Snape,</hi> and were firſt granted with that Monaſtery, to Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> and ſoon after to <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk. Aldburgh</hi> is pretty well ſituated for Strength, and has ſeveral Pieces of Cannon for its Defence. The Church, which is a good Edifice, ſtands on a Hill, a little Weſt of the Town. It is a Town Corporate, governed by Two Bailiffs, Ten capital Burgeſſes, and Twenty-four inferior Officers.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Aldburgh,</hi> I paſſed thro' <hi>Saxminden,</hi> a little dirty Market-town, to <hi>Dunwich,</hi> a very antient Town, which, by <hi>Roman</hi> Coins dug up there, is ſuppoſed to have been a <hi>Roman</hi> Station. In the Reign of <hi>the Conqueror,</hi> it was ſo conſiderable a Place,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0141100401:49"/>
that it had 130 Burgeſſes, and was valued to that King at 50<hi>l.</hi> and 60,000 Herrings. We read that in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> II. it was a very famous Village, well ſtored with Riches, and fortified with a Rampart, ſome Remains of which ſtill appear.</p>
            <p>Before theſe Times, in the Reign of King <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Anno</hi> 630. <hi>Dunwich</hi> was a Biſhop's See; and ſo continued, till the <hi>Conqueror</hi> made his Chaplain Biſhop of it, and tranſlated the See to <hi>Thetford,</hi> which was afterwards tranſlated from thence to <hi>Norwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were ſeveral Religious Houſes in <hi>Dunwich,</hi> and, ſome pretend, no leſs than fifty Churches: but there is a certain Account of ſix Pariſh-churches, and three Chapels, beſides the ſeveral Religious Houſes. Four of theſe Pariſh-churches, and the three Chapels, have been long devoured by the Sea; and one of the others met with the ſame Fate in this Age, ſo that there is only one now ſtanding; and what remains of this once famous Place, is but a pitiful Parcel of ſorry Cottages.</p>
            <p>Hereabouts they begin to talk of Herrings, and the Fiſhery. And here alſo, and at <hi>Swole</hi> or <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>would,</hi> the next Sea-port, they cure Sprats in the ſame manner as they do Herrings at <hi>Yarmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Dunwich</hi> we went to <hi>Southwould,</hi> pleaſantly ſituated on a Hill, and almoſt ſurrounded with the Sea, and the River <hi>Biyth,</hi> over which it has a Bridge. It drives a conſiderable Trade in Salt and old Beer, and in Herrings, Sprats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Church is large, and very ſtrong. The Bay, called corruptly <hi>Sowl</hi> or <hi>Sole-bay,</hi> is a commodious Place for Anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and occaſions a great Reſort of Mariners to it, which adds greatly to its Trade and Commerce.</p>
            <p>The Traffick of my Friend at <hi>Woodbridge, Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and this Place, gave me the Opportunity I hinted at, of making Excurſions into the main-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Parts of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> adjacent to thoſe Towns,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0141100401:50"/>
which I ſhall tranſcribe from my Memorandum-book, in the Order I ſet them down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ufford</hi> is at preſent of no great Remark; but has the Ruins of a Chapel, called <hi>Sogenhoc</hi> Chapel. <hi>Richard Lufkin</hi> was Rector of this Pariſh 57 Years, and was buried <hi>September</hi> 23. 1678. in the 111th Year of his Age. He performed all the Offices of his Function to the laſt, and preached the <hi>Sunday</hi> before his Death. He was plundered in the grand Rebellion, and loſt all that he had except a Silver Spoon, which he preſerved by hiding it in his Sleeve.</p>
            <p>In the Hundred of <hi>Hartſmere</hi> ſtands <hi>Broome,</hi> a noble old Manſion, which for many Ages has been the Seat of the noble Family of <hi>Cornwallis.</hi> In this Pariſh of <hi>Broome</hi> is an Alms-houſe for poor Widows, fronting the Hall; but not endowed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wickham</hi> Market is ſituated about four Miles from <hi>Woodbridge.</hi> The Church is built on a Hill, and tho' but 23 Yards high, affords the beſt Proſpect of any in <hi>Suffolk</hi>; for in a clear Day, near 50 Pariſh-churches may be ſeen from it. It is now only a Village, but has ſome Trade, and the Civil and Spiritual Courts are held in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Snape</hi> was once noted for a famous Monaſtery, few Remains of which are to be ſeen. It has a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable annual Fair for Horſes, which laſts four Days, beginning <hi>Auguſt</hi> 11. to which the <hi>London</hi> Jockeys reſort.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Sudbourne</hi> is a fine Seat of the Lord Viſcount <hi>Hereford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Eaſton</hi> is the Seat of the Earl of <hi>Rochford,</hi> formerly belonging to the <hi>Wingfield</hi> Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Letheringham</hi> was of Note for a little Priory, which was obtained at the Diſſolution by Sir <hi>Antony Wingfield</hi>; and Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> tells us, that, as a Judgment for the Sacrilege, he died without Iſſue Male. It was converted into a Manſion-houſe, and is now the Seat of the antient Family of the

               <hi>Nauntons.</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Naunton</hi> was in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> I. Secretary of State, and Maſter of the Court of Wards and Liveries. He died <hi>Anno</hi> 1630. In the Abbey is a long Gallery, adorned with ſeveral valuable Pictures: And in <hi>Letheringham</hi> Church are, ſome elegant and magnificent Monuments of the <hi>Wingfields</hi> and <hi>Nauntons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rendelſham</hi> was antiently famous for being the Royal Reſidence of <hi>Redwald,</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles. Hugh Fitz-Otho</hi> procured a Market and Fair for this Town, from King <hi>Edward</hi> I. Digging here about 50 Years ago, an antient Silver Crown was found weighing about 60 Ounces, ſuppoſed to have belonged to <hi>Redwald,</hi> or ſome other King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles</hi>; which was ſold and melted down for the ſake of the Metal.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Butley</hi> was a Priory of Canons Regular; founded by <hi>Ranulph de Glanville,</hi> chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> to the Honour of the Bleſſed Virgin. The Ruins of the Abbey, which are ſtill to be ſeen, ſhew it to have been very large; and the Gate-houſe is a magnificent Building: it remains intire, and is embelliſhed in the Front with many Coats of Arms, finely cut in Stone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Framlingham</hi> is ſituate North of <hi>Aldburgh,</hi> a large Town, well-built, and pleaſantly ſeated near the Head of the River <hi>Ore</hi>; it has a ſpacious Market-place; the Church is built of black Flint, and is a very ſtately and noble Edifice, wherein ſeveral of the <hi>Mowbrays</hi> Dukes of <hi>Norfolk</hi> lie buried. The Caſtle is a fair Piece of Antiquity, being a large, beautiful and ſtrong Building; and contains within the Walls now ſtanding an Acre 1 Rood 11 Perches, and was formerly much larger. Its Walls are 44 Feet high, and thick, and are ſtanding pretty intire; and it has 13 Towers, 14 Feet higher than the Walls, two of which are Watch-towers. It was both by Art and Nature formerly very ſtrong.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0141100401:52"/>
There are two good Alms-houſes, and a Free-ſchool, founded by Sir <hi>Robert Hitcham,</hi> (who is interred in the Church) for 40 poor Boys, who are taught to read, write, and caſt Accounts, and 10<hi>l.</hi> is given to ſettle each of them Apprentice. This Gentleman bought of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> the Caſtle, Manor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and gave them to <hi>Pembroke-hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> To this Caſtle Queen <hi>Mary</hi> I. retired, when the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> was proclaimed Queen by the <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> Faction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blithburg</hi> was formerly a Place of good Note, but now has nothing to recommend it but its Church, which is a fine old Building, and kept in good Repair.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Chediſton,</hi> is the fine Seat of <hi>Walter Plumer,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who bought it lately, and rebuilt the Hall in a beautiful manner.</p>

The Streets are clean, and partly paved. It has a very neat Church, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully decorated within, and is noted for Linen-yarn, which is ſpun in the Neighbourhood, and ſold here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hoxne</hi> is the Place where <hi>Edmund</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles</hi> was murdered by the Pagan <hi>Danes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not renounce his Faith, <hi>Anno</hi> 870. and his Body was removed to <hi>Bury,</hi> as above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bungay</hi> is a well-frequented Market-town, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſituate upon and almoſt ſurrounded with the <hi>Waveney,</hi> which is navigable thither for Barges. It lies North-eaſt of <hi>Haleſworth.</hi> Its Streets are moſtly unpaved; but the Town is handſome and well-built ſince the great Fire, which broke out about Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing on <hi>March</hi> 1. 1688-9. in a ſmall uninhabited Houſe; and in four Hours time conſumed the whole Town, except one ſmall Street. The whole Loſs was computed at 29,896<hi>l.</hi> and upwards. It has two Pariſh-churches, one of which is a very noble
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0141100401:53"/>
one; and has a beautiful Steeple. The Ruins of a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Nunnery, and a very ſtrong Caſtle, are ſtill to be ſeen here. The latter was ſo ſtrong, that <hi>Hugh Bigod,</hi> its Owner, in the Wars between the Empreſs <hi>Maud</hi> and King <hi>Stephen,</hi> with the latter of whom he ſided, made this Boaſt upon it:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But yet he was forced afterwards to compound with King <hi>Henry</hi> II. for its Preſervation. It has a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-ſchool with 10 Scholarſhips, for <hi>Emanuel</hi> College <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Excurſion I ſtretched to <hi>Beccles,</hi> ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther North-eaſt; a large ill-built Market-town, ſituate on the <hi>Waveney,</hi> which is navigable hence from <hi>Yarmouth</hi> to <hi>Bungay,</hi> as I have ſaid. It has a noble Church and Steeple, and a Grammar and <hi>Engliſh</hi> School, well endowed. It has a plentiful Market, and a Common of above 1000 Acres. The Streets are well paved and clean, but the Houſes are but ordinary. The Ruins of another Church, called <hi>Ingate</hi> Church are to be ſeen here, which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Pariſh Church to the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Burgh-caſtle</hi> ſcituate at the Mouth of the <hi>Wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> was a Place of conſiderable Note in the Time of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Walls on the Eaſt, North, and South Sides, are ſtill ſtanding, pretty intire; and the River being a Defence on the Weſt, no Wall was wanting there.</p>
            <p>I returned from theſe Excurſions to <hi>Southwould,</hi> in order to proceed on my Journey, according to my firſt Plan. But it may not be amiſs to mention, before I proceed, That this Town is made famous by an Engagement at Sea, in the Year 1672, between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets, in the Bay oppoſite to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0141100401:54"/>
the Town; in which the brave <hi>Montague</hi> Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> Admiral under the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> loſt his Life: his Ship, <hi>Royal Prince,</hi> carrying 100 Guns, which was under him commanded by Sir <hi>Edward Spragg,</hi> was burnt, and ſeveral other Ships loſt, and about 600 Seamen.</p>
            <p>At this Town in particular, and ſo at all the Towns on this Coaſt, from <hi>Orfordneſs</hi> to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> is the ordinary Place where our Summer Friends the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows firſt land when they come to viſit us; and here they may be ſaid to begin their Voyage, when they go back into warmer Climates. I was ſome Years before at this Place, about the Beginning of <hi>October</hi>; and lodging in a Houſe that looked into the Church-yard, I obſerved in the Evening an unuſual Multitude of Swallows ſitting on the Leads of the Church, and covering the Tops of ſeveral Houſes round about. This led me to inquire what was the Meaning of ſuch a prodigious Multitude of Swallows ſitting there: I was anſwered, That this was the Seaſon when the Swallows, their Food fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, began to leave us, and return to the Country, where-ever it be, from whence they came; and that this being the neareſt Land to the oppoſite Coaſt, and the Wind contrary, they were waiting for a Gale, and might be ſaid to be <hi>Wind-bound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was more evident to me, when in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I found the Wind had come about to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt in the Night, and there was not one Swallow to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that the Swallows neither come hither merely for warm Weather, nor retire merely from Cold: they, like the Shoals of Fiſh in the Sea, purſue their Prey; being a voracious Creature, and feeding as they fly; for their Food is the Inſects, of which, in our Summer Evenings, in damp and moiſt Places, the Air is full; and when cold Weather comes in, and kills the Inſects, then Neceſſity
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0141100401:55"/>
compels the Swallows to quit us, and follow their Food to ſome other Climate.</p>
            <p>This paſſing and repaſſing of the Swallows is obſerved no-where ſo much as on this Eaſtern Coaſt; namely from above <hi>Harwich</hi> to the Eaſt Point of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> called <hi>Wintertonneſs,</hi> North; which is oppoſite to <hi>Holland.</hi> We know nothing of them any farther North; the Paſſage of the Sea being, as I ſuppoſe, too broad from <hi>Flambro'</hi> Head, and the Shore of <hi>Holderneſs</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Part of <hi>England</hi> is remarkable for being the firſt where the Feeding and Fattening of Sheep and other Cattle, with Turneps, was firſt practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> which is made a very great Part of the Improvement of their Lands to this Day; and from whence the Practice is ſpread over moſt of the Eaſt and South Part of <hi>England,</hi> to the great enriching of the Farmers, and Increaſe of fat Cattle: and tho' ſome have objected againſt the Goodneſs of the Fleſh thus fed with Turneps, and have fanſied it would taſte of the Root; yet upon Experience 'tis found, that there is no Reaſon for this Fancy.</p>
            <p>The County of <hi>Suffolk</hi> is particularly famous for furniſhing the City of <hi>London,</hi> and all the Counties round, with Turkeys; inſomuch that more Turkeys are bred in this County, and the Part of <hi>Norfolk</hi> that joins to it, for Sale, than in all the reſt of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will this be found an inconſiderable Article, if it be true, that 300 Droves of Turkeys have paſſed, in one Seaſon, over <hi>Stratford-bridge</hi> on the River <hi>Stour,</hi> on the Road from <hi>Ipſwich</hi> to <hi>London</hi>; each Drove generally containing from 300 to 1000 Turkeys, which at 500, one with another, will be 150,000 in all; and yet the Numbers which are driven by <hi>New Market-heath,</hi> and the open Country, and the Foreſt, and alſo thoſe by <hi>Sudbury</hi> and <hi>Clare,</hi> are much greater.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0141100401:56"/>For the further Supplies of the Markets of <hi>London</hi> with Poultry, in which theſe Countries particularly abound, they have within theſe few Years found it practicable to make the Geeſe travel on foot too, and prodigious Numbers are brought up to <hi>London</hi> in like Droves from the fartheſt Parts of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> even from the Fen-Country, about <hi>Lynn, Downham, Wiſbich,</hi> and the <hi>Waſhes</hi>; as alſo from all the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi>; and 'tis very frequent now to meet 1000, or 2000, in a Drove. They begin to drive them generally in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the Harveſt is almoſt over, that the Geeſe may feed on the Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as they go. Thus they hold on to the End of <hi>October,</hi> when the Roads begin to be too ſtiff and deep for their broad Feet and ſhort Legs to march in.</p>
            <p>Beſides ſuch Methods of driving theſe Creatures on Foot, they have of late invented a new kind of Carriage, being Carts formed on purpoſe, with four Stories or Stages, to put the Poultry in, one above another, whereby one Cart will carry a very great Number; and for the ſmoother going, they drive with two Horſes abreaſt, like a Coach; thus quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Road for the Eaſe of the Poultry, and changing Horſes, they travel Night and Day; ſo that they bring the Fowls 70, 80, or 100 Miles in two Days and one Night: The Horſes are faſten'd together by a Piece of Wood lying croſs-wiſe upon their Necks, by which they are kept even and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Driver ſits on the Top of the Cart, as in the publick Carriages for the Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner vaſt Numbers of Turkey-poults and Chickens are carried to <hi>London</hi> every Year, which yield a good Price at Market; and more out of this County than any other Part of <hi>England,</hi> which is the Reaſon of my ſpeaking of it here.</p>
            <p>In this Part, which we call <hi>High Suffolk,</hi> there are not ſo many Families of Gentry or Nobility, as in the other Side of the Country: But 'tis obſerved,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0141100401:57"/>
that tho' their Seats are not here, their Eſtates are; and the Pleaſure of <hi>Weſt Suffolk</hi> is much of it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Wealth of <hi>High Suffolk:</hi> For the Richneſs of the Lands, and Application of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all Kinds of Improvement, are ſcarce credible. The Farmers alſo are ſo very conſiderable, and their Farms and Dairies ſo large, that 'tis very frequent for a Farmer to have 1000<hi>l.</hi> Stock upon his Farm in Cows only.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Southwould,</hi> Coaſt-wiſe, I proceeded to <hi>Leoſtoff,</hi> a conſiderable Market-town, ſtanding near the Sea. It is indifferently well built. The Church, which is ſituate near a Mile on the Weſt-ſide of the Town, is a good Building; but for the Eaſe of its Inhabitants, there is a Chapel in the Town, wherein divine Service is ſometimes celebrated. The <hi>Neſs</hi> below the North-end of the Town is (ſince the waſhing away of <hi>Eaſtonneſs</hi>) the moſt Eaſtern Point of Land in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Its principal Trade is Fiſhing for Herrings and Maycril. It has a noted Market weekly on <hi>Wedneſdays</hi>; and two ſmall Fairs yearly, the one on the 1ſt Day of <hi>May,</hi> and the other on the 29th of <hi>September.</hi> Beſides the preſent Chapel, here was formerly, at the South-end of the Town, a Chapel called <hi>Good-croſs-chapel,</hi> which hath long ſince been deſtroyed by the Sea. This Town, having been Part of the antient Demeſnes of the Crown, hath a Charter, and a Town-ſeal: But the greateſt Privilege they now enjoy from their Charter, is, that of not ſerving on Juries, either at the Seſſions or Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>From <hi>High Suffolk,</hi> I paſſed the <hi>Waveney,</hi> near <hi>Schole-Inn,</hi> and ſo came into <hi>NORFOLK.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, I believe, Sir, you will allow, that I have written enough in all Conſcience for one Letter. I will therefore only further add, that I am,</p>

Moſt of theſe Towns are very populous and large; but that which is moſt remarkable is, that the whole Country round them is interſperſed with Villages ſo large, and ſo full of People, that they are equal to Market-towns in other Counties.</p>
            <p>An eminent Weaver of <hi>Norwich</hi> gave me a Scheme of their Trade on this Occaſion, by which, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating from the Number of Looms at that time employ'd in the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> only, he made it appear very plain, that there were 120,000 People buſy'd in the Woollen and Silk Manufactures of that City only; not that the People all lived in the City, tho' <hi>Norwich</hi> is very large and populous; but they were employ'd for ſpinning the Yarn uſed for ſuch Goods as were all made in that City.</p>
            <p>This ſhews the wonderful Extent of the <hi>Norwich</hi> Manufacture, or Stuff-weaving Trade, by which ſo many thouſand Families are maintained.</p>
            <p>This Throng of Villages continues thro' all the Eaſt Part of the Country, which is of the greateſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0141100401:60"/>
Extent, and where the Manufacture is chiefly carried on: If any Part of it be thin of Inhabitants, it is the Weſt Part, drawing a Line from about <hi>Brandon,</hi> South, to <hi>Walſingham,</hi> North. This Part of the Country indeed is full of open Plains, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſandy and barren, but yet feeds great Flocks of good Sheep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NORWICH</hi> is the Capital of the County, and the Centre of all the Trade and Manufactures which I have juſt mentioned; an antient, large, rich, and populous City: If a Stranger was only to ride thro' or view the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> on ordinary Days, he would be induced to think it a Town without Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; but on the contrary, if he was to view the City, either on a <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> or on any publick Occaſion, he would wonder where all the People could dwell, the Multitude is ſo great: But the Caſe is this; the Inhabitants being all buſy at their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, dwell in their Garrets at their Looms, and in their Combing-ſhops, as they call them, Twiſting-mills, and other Work-houſes; almoſt all the Works they are employ'd in, being done within Doors. There are in this City 32 Pariſhes, beſides the Cathedral, and a great many Meeting-houſes of Diſſenters of all Denominations. The Caſtle is antient and decayed, and now for many Years paſt made uſe of for a Gaol.</p>
            <p>This City, as 'tis ſaid, was built by the <hi>Saxons</hi> out of the Ruins of <hi>Venta Icenorum,</hi> now called <hi>Caſter,</hi> where ſome Years ſince were found ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Urns. In the Time of the <hi>Saxons</hi> it was the principal Seat of the <hi>Eaſt Angles,</hi> and was reduced to Aſhes by <hi>Sueno</hi> the <hi>Dane.</hi> It was re-edified, and Famine only compelled it to yield to <hi>William the Conqueror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The famous Rebellion of <hi>Kett,</hi> the Tanner of <hi>Windham,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. reduced it again to a ruinous State; but it was happily reſtored
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0141100401:61"/>
by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who ſent hither Part of the <hi>Flemings,</hi> that came over from the cruel Perſecution of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>; to whoſe Induſtry and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is owing the rich Manufacture of Stuffs, for which this City is ſo famous.</p>
            <p>The Walls of this City are reckoned three Miles in Circumference, taking in more Ground than the City of <hi>London,</hi> within the Walls; but much of that Ground lies open in Paſture-fields and Gardens; nor does it ſeem to be, like ſome antient Places, a decayed declining Town, the Walls only marking out its antient Dimenſions; for we do not ſee room to ſuppoſe, that it was ever larger or more populous than it is now. But the Walls ſeem to be placed, as if it was expected, that the City would in time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſufficiently to fill them up with Buildings. There are 12 large Gates, which give Entrance to the City.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral is a fine Fabrick, and the Spire-Steeple beautiful, and, next <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> the higheſt in <hi>England.</hi> It is not antient, the Biſhop's See having been firſt at <hi>Thetford,</hi> from whence it was not tranſlated hither till the 12th Century; yet the Church has ſo many Antiquities in it, that our late great Scholar and Phyſician, Sir <hi>Thomas Brown,</hi> thought it worth his while to write a whole Book to collect the Monuments and Inſcriptions in this Church, to which I refer the Reader. It has an Hoſpital in it, for 100 poor Men and Women, and a fine Market-croſs. That called <hi>Bridewell</hi> is a large and moſt beautiful Building of ſquare Flint.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Yare</hi> runs through it, and is navigable thus far without the Help of Locks or Stops; and being increaſed by other Waters, paſſes afterwards through a long Track of the richeſt Meadows, and the largeſt, take them all together, that are any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>England,</hi> lying for 30 Miles in Length, from this City to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> including the Return
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0141100401:62"/>
of the ſaid Meadows on the Bank of the <hi>Waveney,</hi> South, and on the River <hi>Thyrn,</hi> North.</p>
            <p>There are Six large Bridges over the River running thro' the City, called <hi>Helleſden, Coſlany, Black-fryers, Tye-bridge, White-friers,</hi> and <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> Bridges; and to repair theſe Bridges, as alſo the Walls and Gates, and the City Waſtes, Stathes and Wharfs, (which were become ſo ruinous, that the ordinary Revenue of the City was inſufficient for that Purpoſe) an Act of Parliament paſſed in the Year 1725-6. which laid divers Tolls and Impoſts on particular Goods and Merchandizes brought into the City; the Produce of which were alſo to repair the great Roads leading from <hi>Norwich</hi> towards <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; by which means theſe Roads, Bridges, Walls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were put into good Condition, and kept ſo.</p>
            <p>One thing is proper to be mentioned here, which Hiſtory accounts not for. It is this: The River <hi>Waveney</hi> is a conſiderable River, and of a deep and full Chanel, navigable for large Barges as high as <hi>Beccles</hi> and <hi>Bungay</hi>; it runs for a Courſe of about 50 Miles, between the two Counties of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> as a Boundary to both; and puſhing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, tho' with a gentle Stream, no one would doubt, when they ſee the River growing broader and deeper, and going directly towards the Sea, even to the Edge of the Beach, and within a Mile of the main Ocean, but that it would make its Entrance into the Sea at that Place, and afford a noble Harbour for Ships at the Mouth of it; when, on a ſudden, the Land riſing high by the Sea-ſide, croſſes the Head of the River, like a Dam, checks the whole Courſe of it, and it returns, bending its Courſe Weſt, for two Miles, or thereabouts; and then turning North, thro' another long Courſe of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, (joining to thoſe juſt now mentioned) ſeeks out the River <hi>Yare,</hi> joins its Water with hers, and both find their Way to the Sea together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0141100401:63"/>Some of our Hiſtorians tell a long fabulous Story of this River's being once open, and a famous Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Ships belonging to the Town of <hi>Leoſtof</hi> adjoining; but that <hi>Yarmouth</hi> envying the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Leoſtof,</hi> made War upon them; and that after many bloody Battles, as well by Sea as by Land, they came at laſt to a deciſive Action at Sea with their reſpective Fleets; but the <hi>Leoſtof</hi> Fleet being overthrown, and utterly deſtroyed, the <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Men either actually ſtopped up the Mouth of the ſaid River, or obliged the vanquiſhed <hi>Leoſtof</hi> Men to do it themſelves, and bound them never to attempt to open it again.</p>
            <p>I ſee no Authority for this Relation, neither do the Relators agree either in the Time or in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Fact.</p>
            <p>In this vaſt Tract of Meadows are fed a prodigious Number of Black Cattle, which are ſaid to produce the fatteſt Beef, tho' not the largeſt, in <hi>England</hi>; and the Quantity is ſo great, as that they not only ſupply the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Town of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and the County adjacent, but ſend great Quantities of them weekly, in all the Winter Seaſon, to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this in particular is worthy Remark, That the groſs of all the <hi>Scots</hi> Cattle, which come yearly into <hi>England,</hi> are brought to a ſmall Village lying North of the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> called St. <hi>Faith</hi>'s, where the <hi>Norfolk</hi> Graſiers go and buy them.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Scots</hi> Runts, as they call them, coming out of the cold and barren Mountains of the Highlands in <hi>Scotland,</hi> feed ſo eagerly on the rich Paſture in theſe Marſhes, that they thrive in an unuſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and grow very fat; and the Beef is ſo delicious for Taſte, that the Inhabitants prefer them to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cattle, which are much larger and fairer to look at. Some have told me, and I believe with Truth, that there are above 40,000 of theſe <hi>Scots</hi> Cattle fed in this County every Year, and moſt of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0141100401:64"/>
them in the Marſhes between <hi>Norwich, Beccles,</hi> and <hi>Yarmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yarmouth</hi> is an antient Town, much older than <hi>Norwich</hi>; and tho' not extending over ſo much Ground, yet better built, and more complete, and not much inferior in Number of Inhabitants; and for Wealth, Traffick, and Advantage of its Situation, infinitely ſuperior to <hi>Norwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſituated on a Peninſula between the River <hi>Yare</hi> and the Sea; the two laſt lying parallel to one another, and the Town in the Middle: The River lies on the Weſt-ſide of the Town, and being grown very large and deep, by the Receiving of all the Rivers on this ſide the County, forms the Haven: and the Town facing to the Weſt alſo, and open to the River, makes the fineſt Quay in <hi>England,</hi> if not in <hi>Europe,</hi> at leaſt equalling that of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <p>The Ships ride here ſo cloſe, as it were, keeping up one another, with their Head-faſts on Shore, that for half a Mile together, they go croſs the Stream with their Boltſprits over the Land, their Bows or Heads touching the very Wharf; ſo that one may walk from Ship to Ship as on a floating Bridge, all along by the Shore-ſide. The Quay reaching from the Draw-bridge almoſt to the South-gate, is ſo ſpacious and wide, that in ſome Places 'tis near 100 Yards from the Houſes to the Wharf. In this pleaſant and agreeable Range of Houſes are ſome very magnificent Buildings, and, among the reſt, the Cuſtom-houſe and Town-hall, and ſome Merchants Houſes, which look like little Palaces, rather than the Dwelling-houſes of private Men.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Defect of this beautiful Town ſeems to be, that tho' it is very rich, and increaſing in Wealth and Trade, and conſequently in People, there is not Room to inlarge it by new Buildings; being precluded on the Weſt and South-ſides by the River, and on the Eaſt-ſide by the Sea, ſo that there
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0141100401:65"/>
is no Room but on the North-end without the Gate; and there the Land is not very agreeable: but had they had a larger Space within the Gates, there would before now, have been many ſpacious Streets of Buildings erected, as we ſee is done in ſome other thriving Towns in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the Fiſhing-fair, as they call it, one ſees the Land covered with People, and the River with Barks and Boats, buſy Day and Night, landing and carrying off the Herrings, which they catch here in almoſt incredible Quantities. I happened to be there during their Fiſhing-fair, when I told, in one Tide, One hundred and ten Barks and fiſhing Veſſels coming up the River, all loaden with Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, taken the Night before; and this, over and above what was brought on Shore on the Dean (that is the Sea-ſide of the Town) by open Boats, which they call <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Cobles</hi> are open Boats, which come from the North, from <hi>Scarbro', Whitby,</hi> &amp;c. and come to <hi>Yarmouth</hi> to let themſelves out to fiſh for the Merchants during the Fair-time.</note>
               <hi>Cobles,</hi> and which often bring in two or three <note n="†" place="bottom">A Laſt is ten Barrels, each Barrel containing a thouſand Herrings.</note>Laſts of Fiſh at a Time. The <note n="‖" place="bottom">The Barks come from the Coaſt of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> as from <hi>Folkſton, Dover,</hi> and <hi>Rye</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and from <hi>Brighthelmſton</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and let themſelves out to fiſh for the Merchants during the ſaid Fair, as the <hi>Cobles</hi> do from the North.</note>Barks often bring ten Laſts apiece.</p>
            <p>This Fiſhing-fair began on <hi>Michaelmas-day,</hi> and laſts all the Month of <hi>October,</hi> by which time the Herrings draw off to Sea, ſhoot their Spawn, and are no more fit for the Merchants Buſineſs; at leaſt not thoſe that are taken hereabouts.</p>
            <p>We have very different Accounts of the Quantity of Herrings caught here, in this Seaſon; ſome have ſaid, that the Towns of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> and <hi>Leoſtoff</hi> only, have taken 40,000 Laſts in a Seaſon: I will not venture to confirm that Report; but I have heard
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0141100401:66"/>
the Merchants themſelves ſay, that they have cured 40,000 Barrels of merchantable red Herrings in one Seaſon, which (tho' far ſhort of the other) is a very conſiderable Article; and it is to be added, that theſe are over and above all the Herrings conſumed in the Country Towns of both thoſe populous Counties, for 30 Miles from the Sea, whither very great Quantities are carried every Tide during the whole Seaſon.</p>
            <p>But this is only one Branch of the great Trade carried on in this Town; another Part of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is in the exporting theſe Herrings after they are cured; and for this its Merchants have a great Trade to <hi>Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, Meſſina,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> as alſo to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi>; exporting likewiſe with their Herrings great Quantities of Worſted Stuffs, and Stuffs made of Silk and Worſted; Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Manufactures of the neighbouring City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and of the Places adjacent.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, they carry on a very conſiderable Trade with <hi>Holland,</hi> exporting a vaſt Quantity of Woollen Manufactures every Year. Alſo they have a Fiſhing-trade to the North Seas for white Fiſh, which from the Place are called the North Sea Cod.</p>
            <p>They have likewiſe a conſiderable Trade to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and to the <hi>Baltick,</hi> from whence they bring back Deals, and Fir Timber, Oaken Plank, Baulks, Spars, Oars, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, Canvas, and Sail-cloth; with all manner of Naval Stores, for which they generally have a Conſumption in their own Port, where they build a very great Number of Ships every Year, beſides refitting and repairing the old.</p>
            <p>Add to this the Coal-trade between <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> in which they are ſo improved of late Years, that they have now a greater Share of it than any other Town in <hi>England</hi>; and have quite worked the <hi>Ipſwich</hi> Men out of it, who had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0141100401:67"/>
formerly the chief Share of the Colliery in their Hands.</p>
            <p>For the carrying on all theſe Trades, they have a very great Number of Ships, either of their own, or employed by them; and it may in ſome meaſure be judged of by this, That in the Year 1697. I had an Account from the Town Regiſter, that there were then 1123 Sail of Ships uſing the Sea, belonging to the Town, beſides ſuch Ships as the Merchants of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> might be concerned in, and be Part-owners of, belonging to any other Ports.</p>
            <p>To all this I muſt add, without Compliment to the Town, that the Merchants, and even the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Traders of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> have a very good Reputation in Trade, as well Abroad as at Home, for fair and honourable Dealing; and their Seamen, as well Maſters as Mariners, are juſtly eſteemed among the ableſt and moſt expert Navigators in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town, however populous and large, had till lately but one Pariſh-church, dedicated to St. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> tho' it is very large. It has a high Spire, which is an uſeful Sea-mark. It was built by that famous Biſhop of <hi>Norwich, William Herbert,</hi> who flouriſhed in the Reign of <hi>William</hi> II. and <hi>Henry</hi> I. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmſbury</hi> calls him <hi>Vir pecunioſus,</hi> from the Works of Charity and Munificence, which he has left as Witneſſes of his immenſe Riches; for he built the Cathedral Church, the Priory for 60 Monks, the Biſhop's Palace, and the Pariſh-church of St. <hi>Leonard,</hi> all in <hi>Norwich</hi>; this great Church at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> the Church of St. <hi>Margaret</hi> at <hi>Lynn,</hi> and of St. <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Elmham.</hi> He removed the Epiſcopal See from <hi>Thetford</hi> to <hi>Norwich,</hi> and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the <hi>Cluniack</hi> Monks at <hi>Thetford,</hi> and gave them, or built them, a Houſe.</p>
            <p>But in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and the late King <hi>George</hi> I. two Acts paſſed for Building a new
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0141100401:68"/>
Church or Chapel of Eaſe in <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and for enlightening the Streets of the Town, and other Purpoſes, all which is performed in ſo complete a manner as is worthy of the Place.</p>
            <p>Alſo in the Year 1723. an Act paſſed for Clearing, Depthening, Repairing, Extending, Maintaining and Improving the Haven and Piers of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and for depthening and making more navigable the ſeveral Rivers emptying themſelves at that Town; and alſo for preſerving of Ships wintering in the Haven from Accidents by Fire: This Proviſion was a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary one; for the Haven is ſo very commodious for the ſecure and ſafe lying of Ships in the Winter Seaſon, that ſeveral hundred Sail are yearly laid up and winter in it, which lie ſo contiguous to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſo near the Houſes, that in caſe of Fire, not only the Ships, but the Town, would be in Danger of being totally deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Here is one of the fineſt Market-places, and the beſt ſerved with Proviſions in <hi>England, London</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The Streets are all exactly ſtrait from North to South, from Lanes or Alleys, which they call <hi>Rows,</hi> croſſing them in ſtrait Lines alſo from Eaſt to Weſt; ſo that it is the moſt regular-built Town in <hi>England,</hi> and ſeems as if it had been erected all at once upon one uniform Plan.</p>
            <p>They have particular Privileges in this Town, and a Juriſdiction by which they can try, condemn, and execute in eſpecial Caſes, without waiting for a Warrant from Above; and this they exerted once very ſmartly, in executing a Captain of one of the King's Ships of War in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. for a Murder committed in the Street; the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of which did indeed call for Juſtice: but ſome thought they would not have ventured to exert their Power as they did; however, I never heard that the Government reſented it, or blamed them for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0141100401:69"/>It is a very well governed Town; and I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>England</hi> obſerved the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> ſo exactly kept, or the Breach of it ſo conſtantly puniſhed, as in this Place, which I mention to their Honour.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Yarmouth</hi> I reſolved to purſue my firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, <hi>viz.</hi> To view the Sea-ſide on this Coaſt, which is particularly noted for being one of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and moſt fatal to the Sailors in all <hi>Britain</hi>; and the more ſo, becauſe of the great Number of Ships which are continually going and coming this Way, in their Paſſage between <hi>London</hi> and all the Northern Coaſts of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon of which is, that the Shore from the Mouth of the River of <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Road, lies in a ſtrait Line from South-ſouth-eaſt to North-north-weſt, the Land being on the Weſt or Larboard Side. From <hi>Wintertonneſs,</hi> which is the utmoſt eaſterly Point of Land in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and about four Miles beyond <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> the Shore falls off for near 60 Miles to the Weſt, as far as <hi>Lynn</hi> and <hi>Boſton,</hi> till the Shore of <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> tends North again for about 60 Miles more, as far as the <hi>Humber</hi>; whence the Coaſt of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> or <hi>Holderneſs,</hi> which is the Eaſt-Riding, ſhoots out again into the Sea, to the <hi>Spurn,</hi> and to <hi>Flambro' Head,</hi> as far Eaſt almoſt as the Shore of <hi>Norfolk</hi> had given back at <hi>Winterton,</hi> making a very deep Gulph, or Bay, between thoſe two Points of <hi>Winterton</hi> and the <hi>Spurn Head</hi>; ſo that the Ships going North are obliged to ſtretch away to Sea from <hi>Wintertonneſs</hi>; and leaving the Sight of Land in the deep Bay I have mentioned, that reaches to <hi>Lynn,</hi> and the Shore of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> they go, as I obſerved, North or ſtill North-north-weſt, to meet the Shore of <hi>Holderneſs,</hi> which, as I ſaid, runs out into the Sea again at the <hi>Spurn</hi>; this they leave alſo, and the firſt Land they make, is called as above, <hi>Flambro' Head</hi>; ſo that <hi>Wintertonneſs</hi> and <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro' Head</hi> are the two Extremes of this Courſe.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0141100401:70"/>
There is, indeed, the <hi>Spurn Head</hi> between; but as it lies too far in towards the <hi>Humber,</hi> they keep out to the North to avoid coming near it.</p>
            <p>In like manner the Ships which come from the North, leave the Shore at <hi>Flambro' Head,</hi> and ſtretch away South-ſouth-eaſt for <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Roads; and the firſt Land they make is <hi>Wintertonneſs,</hi> as above. Now, the Danger of the Place is this: If the Ships coming from the North are taken with a hard Gale of Wind from the South-eaſt, or from any Point between North-eaſt and South-eaſt, ſo that they cannot weather <hi>Wintertonneſs,</hi> they are thereby kept within that deep Bay; and if the Wind blows hard, are often in Danger of running on Shore upon the Rocks about <hi>Cromere,</hi> on the North-coaſt of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> or ſtranding upon the flat Shore between <hi>Cromere</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi> All the Relief they have, is good Ground-tackle to ride it out, which is very hard to do there, the Sea coming very high upon them; or if they cannot ride it out, then to run into the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the great Bay, to <hi>Lynn</hi> or <hi>Boſton,</hi> which is a very difficult and deſperate Puſh: ſo that ſometimes in this Diſtreſs whole Fleets have been loſt here all together.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Danger are Ships going Northward; for if, after paſſing by <hi>Winterton,</hi> they are taken ſhort with a North-eaſt Wind, and cannot put back into the Roads, which very often happens, they are driven upon the ſame Coaſt, and embay'd juſt as the latter. The Danger on the North-part of this Bay is not the ſame, becauſe if Ships going or coming ſhould be taken ſhort on this ſide <hi>Flambro',</hi> there is the River <hi>Humber</hi> open to them, and ſeveral good Roads to have recourſe to; as <hi>Burlington</hi> Bay, <hi>Grimſby</hi> Road, the <hi>Spurn</hi> Head, and others, where they ride under Shelter.</p>
            <p>The Dangers of this Place being thus conſidered, 'tis no wonder, that upon the Shore beyond <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0141100401:71"/>
there are no leſs than Four Light-houſes kept flaming every Night, beſides the Lights at <hi>Caſtor,</hi> North of the Town, and at <hi>Goulſton,</hi> South. All which are to direct the Sailors to keep a good Offing, in caſe of bad Weather, and to prevent their running into <hi>Cromere-bay,</hi> which the Seamen call the <hi>Devil's Throat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I went by Land from <hi>Yarmouth</hi> North-weſt, along the Shore towards <hi>Cromere</hi> aforeſaid, and was not then fully Maſter of the Reaſon of theſe things, I was ſurpriſed to ſee, in all the Way from <hi>Winterton,</hi> that the Farmers, and Country People had ſcarce a Barn, Shed, Stable, or Pales to their Yards and Gardens, or a Hog-ſtye, or Neceſſary-houſe, but what was built of old Planks, Beams, Wales and Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the deplorable Wrecks of Ships, and Ruins of Mariners and Merchants Fortunes; and in ſome Places were whole Yards filled, and piled up very high, with the ſame Stuff laid up for the like building Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1692. there was a melancholy Example of what I have ſaid of this Place: A Fleet of 200 Sail of light Colliers went out of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Roads with a fair Wind, to purſue their Voyage, and were taken ſhort with a Storm of Wind at North-eaſt. After they were paſt <hi>Wintertonneſs,</hi> a few Leagues, ſome of them, whoſe Maſters made a better Judgment of Things, or who were not ſo far out as the reſt, tacked and put back in time, and got ſafe into the Roads; but the reſt, puſhing on, in hopes to keep out to Sea, and weather it, were by the Violence of the Storm driven back, when they were too far embay'd to weather <hi>Wintertonneſs,</hi> a above; and ſo were forced to run Weſt, every one ſhifting for themſelves, as well as they could; ſome run away for <hi>Lynn Deeps,</hi> but few of them (the Night being ſo dark) could find their Way thither; ſome, but very few, rid it out, at a Diſtance; the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0141100401:72"/>
reſt, being above 140 Sail, were all driven on Shore, and daſhed to Pieces, and very few of the People on Board were ſaved. At the very ſame unhappy Juncture, a Fleet of loaden Ships were coming from the North, and being juſt croſſing the ſame Bay, were forcibly driven into it, not able to weather the <hi>Neſs,</hi> and ſo were involved in the ſame Ruin as the light Fleet was; alſo ſome coaſting Veſſels loaden with Corn from <hi>Lynn</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and bound for <hi>Holland,</hi> were with the ſame unhappy Luck juſt come out, to begin their Voyage, and ſome of them lay at Anchor: theſe alſo met with the ſame Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, ſo that in the whole, above 200 Sail of Ships, and above 1000 People, were loſt in the Diſaſter of that one miſerable Night, very few eſcaping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromere</hi> is a Market-town cloſe to the Shore of this dangerous Coaſt: I know nothing it is famous for (beſides its being thus the Terror of the Sailors) except good Lobſters, which are taken on that Coaſt in great Numbers, and carried to <hi>Norwich,</hi> and in ſuch Quantities ſometimes too, as to be conveyed by Sea to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther within the Land, and between this Place and <hi>Norwich,</hi> are ſeveral good Market-towns, and a great many Villages, all diligently applying to the Woollen Manufacture, and the Country is exceeding fertile, as well in Corn as Paſture; particularly, (which was very pleaſant to ſee) the Pheaſants were in ſuch great Plenty, as to be ſeen in the Stubble like Cocks and Hens; a Teſtimony tho' (by the way) that the County had more Tradeſmen than Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in it. Indeed this Part is ſo intirely given up to Induſtry, that what with the Seafaring-men on the one Side, and the Manufactures on the other, we ſaw no idle Hands here, but every Man buſy.

            <p>From <hi>Cromere</hi> we rode on the Strand or open Shore to <hi>Weyburn Hope,</hi> the Shore ſo flat, that in ſome Places the Tide ebbs out near two Miles From <hi>Weyburn</hi> Weſt lies <hi>Clye,</hi> where there are large Salt-works, and very good Salt made, which is ſold all over the County, and ſometimes ſent to <hi>Holland</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0141100401:74"/>
rendered more difficult than it was; tho' far from ſuppreſſing it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Seven Burnhams,</hi> which are ſo many ſmall Towns called by the ſame Name, and each employed in the ſame <hi>Holland</hi> Trade as <hi>Marham</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> lie on and near the Sea-coaſt to the North-weſt of <hi>Walſingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Sea-coaſt we turned to the South-weſt, thro' <hi>Snetham,</hi> a ſmall Market-town, to <hi>Caſtle-Riſing,</hi> an old decayed Borough Town, with hardly Ten Families in it, which yet ſends Two Members to Parliament; but ſhews a great many Marks of <hi>Roman, Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Daniſh</hi> Antiquities in and about it.</p>
            <p>On our Left we ſaw <hi>Walſingham,</hi> an antient Town, famous for the old Ruins of a Monaſtery there, and the Shrine of our Lady, as noted as that of St. <hi>Thomas-a-Becket</hi> at <hi>Canterbury</hi>; hence called, <hi>Our Lady of Walſingham.</hi> Two Wells here are ſtill called by the Name of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near this Place, at <hi>Raynham,</hi> is the Seat of the Lord Viſcount <hi>Townſhend</hi>; and not far diſtant, at <hi>Houghton,</hi> that noble new-built one of Sir <hi>Robert Walpole</hi>; the Gardens and Plantations of which are very large and beautiful.</p>
            <p>The general Plan and Front of the Houſe and Offices extend to 450 Feet; the great Hall is a Circle of 40 Feet; the Salon 40 by 30 Feet; and all the other Rooms in the four great Apartments are 18 Feet high; the Attick Story is 12 Feet high, and the Ruſtick Story the ſame, all above Ground, under which is an intire Story of Cellars all arched. The Front to the great Entrance extends to 166 Feet, lying open to the Park. The Building is finiſhed with two Towers, dreſſed with two Ruſtick <hi>Venetian</hi> Windows. The Section of the great Hall all in Stone, the moſt beautiful in <hi>England.</hi> The whole Building is of Stone, and without pretending
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0141100401:75"/>
to excuſe any ſeeming or real Defect, it may be truly ſaid to be a Houſe of State and Conveniency worthy of a Prince's Reſidence.</p>
            <p>This ſtately Structure, begun in the Year 1722. was completely finiſhed, Inſide and Outſide, in the Year 1735. the noble Founder having had the ſingular Felicity all the time to continue at the Helm of Affairs, as he does ſtill, <hi>Anno</hi> 1741.</p>

               <q>Here that Sir <hi>ROBERT WAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POLE,</hi> with whom, O Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity! thou ſhalt not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, has fixed me to ſtand as the Foundation of a Seat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be built in his native County, the 24th Day of <hi>May</hi> in the Year 1722. God grant, that after its Maſter, to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Old Age, ſhall have long enjoy'd it in Perfection, his lateſt Deſcendants may ſafely and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely poſſeſs it to the End of Time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The noble Founder had doubtleſs in his Thoughts, in this Inſcription, the uncertain State of Prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and of the ſuperb Structures built by them in the Height of their Power in all Ages and Countries; and we hope the Merits of him and his Deſcendants to their native Country may induce the Almighty to give a <hi>Fiat</hi> to his Prayer.</p>
            <p>We proceeded hence to <hi>Lynn,</hi> another rich and populous Port-town, well built, and well ſituated, at the Mouth of the River <hi>Ouſe</hi>; which has the greateſt Extent of inland Navigation, of any Port in <hi>England, London</hi> excepted. The Reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that more navigable Rivers empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here into the Sea, including the Waſhes,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0141100401:76"/>
which are Branches of the ſame Port, than at any one Mouth of Waters in <hi>England,</hi> except the <hi>Thames</hi> and the <hi>Humber.</hi> By theſe navigable Rivers the Merchants of <hi>Lynn</hi> ſupply about ſix Counties wholly, and three Counties in Part, with their Goods, eſpecially Wine and Coals; <hi>viz.</hi> By the little <hi>Ouſe,</hi> they ſend their Goods to <hi>Brandon</hi> and <hi>Thetford</hi>; by the Lake, to <hi>Mildenhall, Barton-Mills,</hi> and <hi>St. Edmundſbury</hi>; by the River <hi>Grant</hi> to <hi>Cambridge</hi>; by the great <hi>Ouſe</hi> itſelf, to <hi>Ely,</hi> to <hi>St. Ives,</hi> to St. <hi>Neots,</hi> to <hi>Barford-bridge,</hi> and to <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>; by the River <hi>Nyne,</hi> to <hi>Peterboro</hi>'; by the Drains and Waſhes to <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> to <hi>Spalding, Market-deeping,</hi> and <hi>Stamford</hi>; beſides the ſeveral Counties, into which theſe Goods are carried by Land Carriage, from the Places where the Navigation of thoſe Rivers ends; which has given Riſe to this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Town of <hi>Lynn,</hi> That they bring in more Coals, than any Sea-port between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and import more Wines than any Port in <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi>; their Trade to <hi>Norway,</hi> and to the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> is alſo great in Proportion, and of late Years they have extended it farther to the Southward.</p>
            <p>There are many Gentry, and conſequently more Gayety, in this Town than in <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> or even <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Place abounding in very good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and indeed it is ſo conſiderable, that it merits as particular a Deſcription as the Nature of this Work will admit; and which, therefore, I will give as ſuccinctly as I can.</p>
            <p>To begin then: This Town was firſt called <hi>Lynn-Epiſcopi,</hi> as the Property of the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> till the Diſſolution of Monaſteries by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. when that Prince, becoming its Poſſeſſor, conferred on it the Name of <hi>Lynn Regis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0141100401:77"/>It is ſituated towards the Mouth of the <hi>Great Ouſe,</hi> encompaſſed with a deep Trench, walled almoſt all round, containing about 2400 Houſes, and divided by four Rivulets arched over with about 15 Bridges. It extends along the Eaſt-ſide of the River; which in high Spring-tides flows above 20 Feet perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and is about the Breadth of the <hi>Thames</hi> above Bridge, for the Length of a Mile, and is divided into nine Wards. On the North-end, towards the Sea, ſtands <hi>St. Anne's Fort,</hi> with a Platform of 12 large Guns, commanding all Ships which paſs by the Harbour; and towards the Land, beſides the Wall, there are nine regular Baſtions and a Ditch, nearly in the Form of a Semicircle, which make it above half a Mile in Breadth. The Town is ſo antient as to be ſuppoſed the ſame with <hi>Maiden-Bower,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſeveral old Hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>It has many remarkable Places, which deſerve a more particular Deſcription than I have Room for: however, I ſhall touch upon them briefly; as, <hi>St. Margaret</hi>'s Church, the <hi>Town-hall, Bridewell,</hi> the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> and <hi>Exchange,</hi> the <hi>Market-croſs, St. Nicolas</hi>'s Chapel, <hi>All-Saints</hi> Church, the <hi>Free-School,</hi> the <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> the Statue of King <hi>James</hi> II. King <hi>John</hi>'s Sword and Cup, the common <hi>Stath-yard,</hi> the <hi>Lady's Mount,</hi> the publick Libraries, the King's <hi>Stath-yard,</hi> and other Remarkables, of which in their Order; and firſt of <hi>St. Margarets</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>This Church, which was formerly an Abbey, and is one of the largeſt Parochial Churches in <hi>England,</hi> is adorned with a very fair and high Lanthorn, covered with Lead, containing the Clock-bell, lately caſt, which may be heard all over the Town. Its Height is 132 Feet. At the Weſt-end ſtands a Stone Tower, 82 Feet high; and facing the Street a Moon-dial, deſigned to tell the Increaſe and Decreaſe of that Planet, with the exact Hour of the Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It moves by Clock-work. Over the Tower is a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0141100401:78"/>
Spire 193 Feet high in form of a Pyramid; near to which is the Bell-tower built of Free-ſtone, 86 Feet high, containing a Ring of eight Bells. In this Church is kept the Biſhop's Court, when he comes hither on his Viſitation.</p>
            <p>The Town-houſe, called <hi>Trinity-hall,</hi> is an antient and noble Building, which makes a fine Appearance.</p>
            <p>Adjoining to it is the Houſe of Correction called <hi>Bridewell,</hi> with Apartments proper for the Reception of ſuch as are put there; who beat and dreſs Hemp during their Confinement.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Exchange</hi> is a fair Structure of Free-ſtone, with two Orders of Columns, ſituated in the Middle of the Town, and built at the Expence of Sir <hi>John Turner,</hi> Knight; and within it is the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> containing ſeveral commodious Apartments.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Market-houſe</hi> is a new Edifice of Free-ſtone, in the modern Taſte, 70 Feet high, erected on four Steps, neatly adorned with Statues, and other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments; with an Inſcription giving an Account of its former Condition, and preſent Rebuilding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Nicolas</hi>'s Chapel is very antient, and ſtands at the North-end of the Town. It is an Appendage to <hi>St. Margaret</hi>'s, and is eſteemed one of the faireſt and largeſt religious Fabricks in <hi>England</hi>; it has a Bell-tower of Free-ſtone, and a pyramidical octan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Spire over it, both which together are 170 Feet from the Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All-Saints</hi> Church, in <hi>South-Lynn,</hi> belonged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to the <hi>Carmelite</hi> and <hi>White</hi> Friers, on the Ruins of whoſe Monaſtery it is built. Tho' not large, it is neat, ſolid and regular, in form of a Croſs, within a Church-yard well walled in.</p>
            <p>On the North-ſide of <hi>St. Margaret</hi>'s Church-yard is the <hi>Free-ſchool,</hi> a ſtrong and beautiful Building.</p>
            <p>The only Fabrick formerly belonging to any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Order, now ſtanding, is the <hi>Grey-Fryers</hi> Steeple, a noted Sea-mark; which was repaired and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0141100401:79"/>
amended out of the Ruins of a demoliſhed Chapel in the Year 1539. It may not be amiſs to mention here a remarkable and laudable Order, that was made in the Year 1588. That on every firſt <hi>Monday</hi> in the Month there ſhould be a Meeting of the Mayor, Aldermen, ſome of the Common-Council, and the Preachers, in order to ſettle Peace and Quietneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man, and to decide all manner of Controverſies: this was called <hi>The Feaſt of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Pariſh of <hi>All-Saints</hi> is a ſmall <hi>Hoſpital</hi> for four poor Men to live rent-free. <hi>St. Mary Magdalen</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> founded in the Reign of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> for a Prior, and 12 Brethren and Siſters, continued in a flouriſhing Condition about 400 Years; and devolved to the Crown at the making the Statute for Diſſolution of religious Houſes in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. in whoſe Time it was robbed, and almoſt levelled with the Ground, by <hi>Kett</hi>'s Mutineers, at their Return from their fruſtrated At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſurpriſe <hi>Lynn:</hi> ſo that it remained deſtitute of Brethren and Siſters, except ſome poor People, whom the Mayor and Burgeſſes maintained with Deſign to ſupport the antient Hoſpital, till King <hi>James</hi> I. upon Petition reſtored them their Lands, granted them many Privileges, and incorporated them: but in the Year 1643. it was a ſecond time deſtroy'd by Fire by the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi>'s Forces, when they beſieged <hi>Lynn,</hi> then ſtanding out for the King. In the Year 1649. the Corportation rebuilt it very commodiouſly, as at preſent, with two Courts, a Chapel, and convenient Apartments for the Maſter, Brethren, and Siſters, and ſeveral Inſcriptions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating the late Diſaſter. It is now committed to the Care of Two of the Elder Aldermen, choſen for that Purpoſe by the other Governors.</p>
            <p>There is in the great Market-place a Statue erected in the Year 1686. to the Honour of King <hi>James</hi> II.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0141100401:80"/>
with an Inſcription that may ſerve for a Satire on the undue Compliments which are frequently paid to Princes, during the Time of their Proſperity. It ſtands on a Pedeſtal, which has ſeveral Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and is incloſed within a Paliſade of Iron. The Inſcription is as follows:<q>
                  <hi>Non immemor</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In 1682. an old ruinous Building, which was once a Chapel, was, by the Corporation, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, made a publick Receptacle for poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to learn to ſpin Wooll: here they are alſo taught to read. It is now, by Act of Parliament, ſettled and veſted in the Guardians of the Poor.</p>
            <p>There was a Church formerly in the Town, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>John,</hi> and belonging to the Hoſpital of that Name, both which are alike extinct.</p>
            <p>The Corporation boaſts of having been preſented by King <hi>John</hi> with a very rich double-gilt Cup and Cover, weighing 73 Ounces, which is preſerved to this Day, and uſed on publick Occaſions; and at the ſame time a large Sword, with a Silver Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from his own Side, as is engraven on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on the Hilt.</p>
            <p>The Entrance into the common <hi>Stath-yard</hi> from the <hi>Tueſday</hi> Market is by two large Gate-ways with habitable Rooms over them. It is a beautiful large ſquare Area, with a commodious Quay or Wharf, ſurrounded with Ware-houſes and Granaries for all ſorts of Merchandize with ſpacious Vaults.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0141100401:81"/>At a ſmall Diſtance from the Town, ſtands a ruinous Pile, called <hi>The Lady's Mount,</hi> or <hi>Red Mount</hi>; wherein formerly was a Chapel dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin, which ſerved as a Receptacle for Pilgrims travelling this Way towards the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Convent of <hi>Our Lady</hi> at <hi>Walſingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Library at <hi>St. Nicolas</hi> was erected by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Subſcription of ſeveral Hundred Pounds; to which the late Lord <hi>Townſhend,</hi> (who took his Title of Baron from this Town) Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Turner,</hi> and <hi>Robert Britiffe,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> deceaſed, were conſiderable Benefactors. There is alſo another Library at <hi>St. Margaret</hi>'s, to which the late <hi>Thomas Thurlin,</hi> D. D. Preſident of <hi>St. John</hi>'s in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> bequeathed all his Books; and alſo left an Exhibition of Six Pounds a Year to a poor Scholar, who ſhould go from the Grammar-ſchool to <hi>St. John</hi>'s College in <hi>Cambridge</hi>; and forty Shillings yearly towards the Cloathing three of the pooreſt Inhabitants of <hi>Gaywood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Lynn</hi> ſuffer great Inconvenience from the want of freſh-water Springs within the Town; with which Element, however, they are ſupplied from a River running by <hi>Gaywood,</hi> and by leaden Pipes from <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Mintling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>St. Edmund,</hi> in <hi>North-Lynn,</hi> was long ago intirely ſwallowed up by the Sea.</p>
            <p>The King's <hi>Stath-yard</hi> is a very handſome Square, with Brick Buildings fronting each Way; in the Centre of which ſtands the Statue of <hi>James</hi> I. in a Nich fronting the Weſt. Here the greateſt Part of imported Wines are landed, as it has a convenient Quay, and large Wine-vaults.</p>
            <p>At the South-end of the Town ſtood an Oil-mill, framed in <hi>Holland,</hi> and brought over hither near 100 Years ago. It gave a pleaſant Proſpect to every Part of the Town; but in the Year 1737. was conſumed by Fire</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0141100401:82"/>From what has been ſaid, it will be obſerved, that the Situation of this Town renders it capable of being made very ſtrong; and in the late Wars it was ſo, a Line of Fortification being drawn round it at a Diſtance from the Walls; the Ruins, or rather Remains of which Works appear to this Day; nor would it be a hard Matter to reſtore the Baſtions, with the Ravelins and Counterſcarp, upon any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Emergency, to a good State of Defence; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe they are able to fill all their Ditches with Water from the Sea, in ſuch a manner as that it cannot be drawn off.</p>
            <p>They paſs over here in Boats into the Fen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and over the famous Waſhes into <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi>; but the Paſſage is very dangerous and uneaſy; for here Paſſengers often miſcarry, and are loſt; but then it is uſually on their venturing at improper times, and without the Guides, which if they would be perſuaded not to do, they would very rarely fail of going or coming ſafe.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Lynn,</hi> I bent my Courſe Southward to <hi>Downham,</hi> where is an ugly wooden Bridge over the <hi>Ouſe</hi>; at which, as <hi>Hollingſhead</hi> informs us, in <hi>October</hi> 1568. were taken 17 monſtrous Fiſhes, from 20 to 27 Feet long.</p>
            <p>When we were at <hi>Downham,</hi> we took a Turn to the antient Town of <hi>Thetford,</hi> ſituated partly in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and partly in <hi>Suffolk.</hi> It was raiſed on the Ruins of the antient <hi>Sitomagus,</hi> which was deſtroy'd by the <hi>Danes.</hi> It is at preſent but meanly built; but by the Ruins of Churches and Monaſteries ſtill remaining, appears to have been formerly of great Account; and even ſo far back as the Time of King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> it had 947 Burgeſſes, and in that of <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> 720 Manſions. On the <hi>Suffolk</hi> Side there now remain the Ruins of ſix Churches and Monaſteries, and there were ſeveral others in the Town; but now there are but three

Pariſh Churches ſtanding intire, one on the <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and two on the <hi>Norfolk</hi> Side. It is, however, a Town Corporate, governed by a Mayor, Aldermen and Common-council; has three annual Fairs, a plentiful weekly Market, and is a kind of See ſuffragan to that of <hi>Norwich.</hi> In the 7th Year of King <hi>James</hi> I. an Act paſſed for the Founding of an Hoſpital, a Grammar-ſchool, and Maintenance of a Preacher in this Town for ever, according to the laſt Will of Sir <hi>Richard Fulmarſton:</hi> And Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> Secretary of State to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. built here a new Council-houſe, and was otherwiſe a good Benefactor to the Place. The <hi>Lent</hi> Aſſizes are uſually held here.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Thetford</hi> we croſſed the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> to <hi>Brandon,</hi> which gives the Title of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duke to Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This is no ill-built Town, and has a good Church belonging to it. It gave a Lord Mayor to <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1445; <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Simon Eyre,</hi> Draper, who built <hi>Leadenhall</hi> for the Uſe of the City, and left 5000 Marks, a very great Sum in thoſe Days, to charitable Uſes. <hi>Brandon</hi> has loſt its Market, but ſtands conveniently upon the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> over which it has a Bridge, and a Ferry, to convey Goods to and from the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> to which we directly bent our Courſe.</p>
            <p>We made an Excurſion from <hi>Ely</hi> Northwards up to the <hi>Fens</hi>; but we ſaw nothing that Way worth our Curioſity, or remarking, but deep Roads, vaſt Drains and Dykes of Water, which are all navigable; but with all this, a very rich Soil, bearing a great Quantity of Hemp, but a bad unwholſome Air.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> however, which lies on the Northern Extremity of the County, has not only been of Note in the Conqueror's Time, who built a Caſtle here; but is now a well-built Market-town, has a good Town-hall, and is eſteemed the beſt Trading-town in the Iſle, as having the Convenience of good
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0141100401:84"/>
Water-carriage to <hi>London,</hi> whither they ſend great Quantities of Oil and Butter, and bring back all ſorts of Commodities, with which the whole Iſle is furniſhed; for it has a plentiful Market.</p>
            <p>A good way lower down, to the South, are the two Market-towns of <hi>Merſh</hi> and <hi>Thorney</hi>; the firſt is very inconſiderable, the other is delightfully ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; and the Land about it very fruitful in Graſs and Trees.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſle of Ely</hi> is encompaſſed with the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> and other Waters. The City is ſituated on a Hill, in the Middle of a great Plain. It is full of Springs, inſomuch that in the principal Street, in the Eaſt Part of the Town, there are Wells bricked up Knee-high almoſt at every hundred Yards, which the whole Year generally overflow from one to another, all the way down the Declivity of the Hill on which the Town ſtands. The Soil is exceeding rich, and the City is encompaſſed with Gardens, the Produce of which is ſo excellent, that it furniſhes all the County for 20 Miles round, even as far as <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>St. Ives</hi>; the former of which has almoſt all its Garden-ſtuff from hence. Great Quantities of Strawberries are cultivated here, particularly of the white Wood ſort.</p>
            <p>The moſt remarkable thing that I obſerved of the Minſter was, that it is ſeen for many Miles round; but is ſo old, that it ſeems to totter with every high Guſt of Wind.</p>
            <p>On the Eaſt-ſide of the <hi>Cam,</hi> a little below <hi>Ely,</hi> ſtands <hi>Soham,</hi> a little Market-town towards the Borders of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> near the Marſhes, which were formerly dangerous to paſs; but now there is a Cauſey made, which leads very ſecurely over them. Here are the Remains of an antient Church, which was ruined by the <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We proceeded from hence to <hi>Newmarket.</hi> Near <hi>Snaybell,</hi> as we went, we ſaw a noble Seat of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0141100401:85"/>
               <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> created Earl of <hi>Orford,</hi> for the glorious Victory obtained under his Command over the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and the burning their Ships at <hi>La Hogue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Situation of this Houſe is low, and on the Edge of the Fen Country; but the Building is fine, the Apartments noble, and the Gardens well-finiſhed. On the Earl's Death it devolved to <hi>Samuel Sandys,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in Right of his Wife, one of the Earl's Heirs, who now poſſeſſes it.</p>
            <p>Arriving at <hi>Newmarket</hi> in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> I had the Opportunity to ſee the Horſe-races, and a great Concourſe of the Nobility and Gentry, as well from <hi>London,</hi> as from all Parts of <hi>England</hi>; but they were all ſo intent, ſo eager, ſo buſy upon what is called the ſharping Part of the Sport, of Wagers and Bets, that to me they ſeemed rather like ſo many Horſe-courſers in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> than Perſons of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Quality, who deſcend ſo low as even to circumvent one another; and, if I may ſpeak it, pick one another's Pockets. To ſee a Perſon of Diſtinction who, perhaps, being ennobled, his Word of Honour, by the Laws of the Land, is to be eſteemed and received with equal Sanction as an Oath in our Courts of Juſtice, level himſelf with a Groom, or a Riding-boy, and put his Credit and Honour in his Hands with a Bribe, to betray his Maſter and his Truſt, is a thing ſcarce credible among thoſe who are really Men of Honour; and yet it is too often the Caſe, to the indelible Shame of Men of Rank and Quality be it ſpoken in particular, and to the Reproach of the Nation in general! How different is this Conduct from that of thoſe in the <hi>Circus</hi> at <hi>Rome?</hi> How much more different from thoſe who gained ſo much Honour in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Races? What <hi>Pindar</hi> could be found in theſe Days to celebrate them? What muſt his Subject be, Tricks and Circumventions! Alas! How dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate! And yet theſe Races were inſtituted with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0141100401:86"/>
a very good Intent, to raiſe an Emulation in our Nobility and Gentry, to keep up and preſerve a Race of good Horſes, in Honour of the Nation in general; but as the Inſtitution is debaſed, it is not the beſt Horſe that wins the Race; but that which is deſtined for it by a Combination.</p>
            <p>Before I was let into the Secret, as 'tis called, which is indeed nothing but the knaviſh Part of the Sport, I was much diverted with theſe Races; but when I was, I rejoiced not a little at the Regulation that it has met with from the Power that only had Authority to make it. For this Diverſion becoming a publick Nuiſance, by ſpreading itſelf in little Matches all over the Kingdom, the Legiſlature took Cognizance of it, and in the 13th of King <hi>George</hi> II. a Law paſſed, which injoins as follows; <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>That none but the Owners of Horſes ſhall enter them, and but one Horſe at a Time.</item>

            </p>
            <p>I went in the Intervals of the Sport to ſee the fine Seats of the Gentlemen in the neighbouring County; for this Part of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> being an open champain Country, and in a healthy Air, is formed for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and all kinds of rural Diverſion; Nature,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0141100401:87"/>
as it were, inviting the Gentlemen to viſit her, where ſhe is plentifully furniſhed to receive them; and the Country is accordingly in a manner covered with fine Palaces of the Nobility, and pleaſant Seats of the Gentry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euſton-hall,</hi> the Seat of the Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> lies in the open Country towards the Side of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> not far from <hi>Thetford</hi>; a Place capable of all that is pleaſant and delightful in Nature, and greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Art.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to <hi>Ruſhbrook,</hi> formerly the Seat of the noble Family of <hi>Jermyns,</hi> lately Lord <hi>Dover,</hi> and now of the Houſe of <hi>Davers.</hi> Then we ſaw <hi>Brently,</hi> the Seat of the Earl of <hi>Dyſert,</hi> and the antient Palace of my Lord <hi>Cornwallis,</hi> with ſeveral others moſt agreeably ſituated, and adorned with the Beauties-both of Art and Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newmarket</hi> is a handſome well-built Town, and being a Thorough-fare, reaps no ſmall Advantage by that means as well as from the Races. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefly of one long Street, the North-ſide of which is in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the South in <hi>Cambridgeſhire.</hi> The King has a Houſe of his own, where he reſides when he thinks fit to come to the Races. The Town has two Churches belonging to it, and a Free-ſchool endowed by King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
            <p>We entered <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi> out of <hi>Suffolk</hi> with all the Advantage that can be imagined; juſt upon thoſe pleaſant and agreeable Plains, called <hi>Newmarket-Heath.</hi> Acroſs which extends a Fortification, or Ditch, with a Rampart, commonly called <hi>The Devil's Dyke,</hi> as Works of an extraordinary Nature are generally, by the Vulgar, attributed to that Prince of Darkneſs thro' the Nation; but among the Gentry it is beſt known by the Name of <hi>Rech Dyke,</hi> from <hi>Rech,</hi> a ſmall Market-town lying near the Heath. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been the Boundary of the Kingdom of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0141100401:88"/>Paſſing this Ditch, we ſee from the Hills called <hi>Gogmagog,</hi> or rather <hi>Hogmagog,</hi> a rich and pleaſant Vale Weſtward, covered with Corn-fields, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Seats, Villages; and at a Diſtance, to crown all the reſt, that antient and truly famous Town and Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Capital of the County.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> except the Fen Country, is almoſt wholly a Corn Country; and of that Corn five Parts in ſix of all they ſow, is Barley, which is generally ſold to <hi>Ware</hi> and <hi>Royſton,</hi> and other great Malting-towns in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> and is the Fund from whence that vaſt Quantity of Malt, called <hi>Hertfordſhire</hi> Malt, is made, which is eſteemed the beſt in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> As <hi>Eſſex, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> are taken up in Manufactures, and famed for Induſtry, this County has no Manufacture at all; nor are the Poor, except the Huſbandmen, noted for any thing ſo much as Idleneſs and Sloth, to their Scandal be it ſpoken! What the Reaſon of it is, I know not.</p>
            <p>On the Top of <hi>Hogmagog Hills</hi> appears an antient Camp, or Fortification, with a treble Rampart and Ditch, which moſt of our Writers ſay was neither <hi>Roman</hi> nor <hi>Saxon,</hi> but <hi>Britiſh.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> II. cauſed a ſpacious Stable to be built in the Area of this Camp, for his Running-horſes, and made old Mr. <hi>Frampton</hi> Maſter or Inſpector of them: The Stables remain ſtill there, tho' they are not often made uſe of. The Earl <hi>Godolphin</hi> has here a fine Houſe on the very Summit of the Hill, to which his Lordſhip frequently reſorts, eſpecially in the Racing-ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>As we deſcended Weſtward, we ſaw the Fen Country on our Right, almoſt all covered with Water like a Sea. The <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Rains, having been very great that Year, ſent down vaſt Floods of Water from the Upland Countries; and thoſe Fens being the Sink of no leſs than 13 Counties, they are often thus overflowed. The Rivers which thus empty themſelves into theſe Fens, and carry off the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0141100401:89"/>
Water, are the <hi>Cam</hi> or <hi>Grant,</hi> the <hi>Great Ouſe,</hi> and <hi>Little Ouſe,</hi> the <hi>Nene,</hi> the <hi>Welland,</hi> and the River which runs from <hi>Bury</hi> to <hi>Milden-hall.</hi> The Counties which theſe Rivers drain, as above, are thoſe of

In a Word, all the Water of the Middle Part of <hi>England,</hi> which does not run into the <hi>Thames</hi> or the <hi>Trent,</hi> comes down into theſe Fens.</p>
            <p>In theſe Fens are abundance of thoſe admirable Pieces of Art call'd <hi>Duckoys,</hi> and it is incredible what Quantities of Wild-fowl of all ſorts, Duck, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, Teal, Wigeon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they take in them every Week during the Seaſon: It may indeed be gueſſed at in ſome meaſure by this, that there is a Duckoy not far from <hi>Ely,</hi> which yields the Landlord 500<hi>l.</hi> a Year clear of the Charge of maintaining a great Number of Servants for the Management; from whence alone they aſſured me at <hi>St. Ives,</hi> (a Town on the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> whither the Fowls are always brought to be conveyed to <hi>London</hi>) that they generally ſent up 3000 Couples a Week.</p>
            <p>There are more of theſe about <hi>Peterborough,</hi> from whence Waggon Loads are ſent up twice a Week to <hi>London.</hi> I have ſeen theſe Waggons, before the Act of Parliament to regulate Carriers, drawn by ten or twelve Horſes apiece, they were loaden ſo heavy.</p>
            <p>As theſe Fens appear overwhelm'd with Water, I obſerved that they generally at this latter Part of the Year appear alſo covered with Fogs; ſo that, when the Downs and higher Grounds of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Country gliſtered with the Beams of the Sun,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0141100401:90"/>
the <hi>Iſle of Ely</hi> ſeemed wrapped up in Miſt and Darkneſs, ſo that nothing could be diſcerned but now and then the Cupola of <hi>Ely</hi> Minſter.</p>
            <p>One could hardly ſee this from the Hills, without Concern for the many thouſand Families confined to thoſe Fogs, who had no other Breath to draw, than what muſt be mixed with the choaking Vapours, which ſpread over all the Country: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, the People, eſpecially thoſe that are uſed to it, live as healthy as thoſe in a clearer Air, except now-and-then an Ague, which they make light of; and there are great Numbers of very antient People among them. An Act paſſed a few Years ago for the effectual Draining and Preſervation of <hi>Haddenham Level</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Ely,</hi> which contains 6500 Acres, which were overflowed chiefly thro' the Neglect of preſerving and clearing the Out-falls into the Sea; and as theſe Grounds are naturally very rich and fertile, it may be imagined what a Benefit muſt accrue to the Publick by this means, when the Draining and Recovery of them can be completed.</p>
            <p>Having been at <hi>Sturbridge-fair,</hi> when it was in its Height in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> the Year before I was at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> I muſt ſay, that it is not only the greateſt in the whole Nation, but I think in <hi>Europe</hi>; nor is the Fair at <hi>Leipſick</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Mart at <hi>Frankfort</hi> on the <hi>Main,</hi> or the Fairs at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> or <hi>Auſburg,</hi> reputed any way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this at <hi>Sturbridge</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">This Fair is pretty much dwindled ſince this Account of it; tho' it is ſtill very conſiderable.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is kept in a large Corn-field, near <hi>Caſterton,</hi> extending from the Side of the River <hi>Cam,</hi> towards the Road, for about half a Mile ſquare.</p>
            <p>If the Field be not cleared of the Corn before a certain Day in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Fair-keepers may trample it under-foot, to build their Booths or Tents. On
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0141100401:91"/>
the other hand, to balance that Severity, if the Fair-keepers have not cleared the Field by another certain Day in <hi>September,</hi> the Plowmen may re-enter with Plow and Cart, and overthrow all into the Dirt; and as for the Filth, Dung, Straw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> left behind by the Fair-keepers, which is very conſiderable, theſe become the Farmers Fees, and make them full Amends for the trampling, riding, carting upon, and hardening the Ground.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe all the Parts and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this Fair exactly; the Shops are placed in Rows like Streets, whereof one is called <hi>Cheap-ſide</hi>; and here, as in ſeveral other Streets, are all Sorts of Traders, who ſell by Retale, and come chiefly from <hi>London.</hi> Here may be ſeen Goldſmiths, Toymen, Braſiers, Turners, Milaners, Haberdaſhers, Hatters, Mercers, Drapers, Pewterers, China-ware-houſes, and, in a Word, all Trades that can be found in <hi>London</hi>; with Coffee-houſes, Taverns, and Eating-houſes in great Numbers and all kept in Tents and Booths.</p>
            <p>This great Street reaches from the Road, which, as I ſaid, goes from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort out of it to the Right towards the River, and holds in a Line near half a Mile quite down to the River-ſide. In another Street parallel with the Road are the like Rows of Booths, but ſomewhat larger, and more intermingled with Wholeſale Dealers; and one Side, paſſing out of this laſt Street to the Left-hand, is a great Square, formed of the largeſt Booths, called the <hi>Duddery</hi>; but whence ſo called, I could not learn. The Area of this Square is from 80 to 100 Yards, where the Dealers have room before every Booth to take down and open their Packs, and to bring in Waggons to load and unload.</p>
            <p>This Place being peculiar to the Wholeſale Dealers in the Woollen Manufacture, the Booths,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0141100401:92"/>
or Tents are of a vaſt Extent, have different Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Quantities of Goods they bring are ſo great, that the Inſides of them look like ſo many <hi>Blackwell-halls,</hi> and are vaſt Warehouſes piled up with Goods to the Top. In this <hi>Duddery,</hi> as I have been informed, have been ſold 100,000 Pounds-worth of Woollen Manufactures in leſs than a Week's time; beſides the prodigious Trade carried on here by Wholeſale-men from <hi>London,</hi> and all Parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who tranſact their Buſineſs wholly in their Pocket-books, and meeting their Chapmen from all Parts, make up their Accounts, receive Money chiefly in Bills, and take Orders. Theſe, they ſay, exceed by far the Sales of Goods actually brought to the Fair, and delivered in Kind; it being frequent for the <hi>London</hi> Wholeſale-men to carry back Orders from their Dealers, for 10,000 Pounds-worth of Goods a Man, and ſome much more. This eſpecially reſpects thoſe People, who deal in heavy Goods, as Wholeſale Grocers, Salters, Braſiers, Iron-merchants, Wine-merchants, and the like; but does not exclude the Dealers in Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and eſpecially in Mercery Goods of all ſorts, who generally manage their Buſineſs in this manner.</p>
            <p>Here are Clothiers from <hi>Halifax, Leeds, Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> and <hi>Huthersfield</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and from <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, Bury,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> with vaſt Quantities of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Cloths, Kerſeys, Penniſtons, Cottons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all ſorts of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> Ware, Fuſtians, and Things made of Cotton Wooll; of which the Quantity is ſo great, that they told me there were near 1000 Horſe-packs of ſuch Goods from that Side of the Country, and theſe took up a Side and Half of the <hi>Duddery</hi> at leaſt; alſo a Part of a Street of Booths were taken up with Upholſters Ware; ſuch as Tickens, Sackens, <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> Stuffs, Blankets, Rugs, Quilts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0141100401:93"/>In the <hi>Duddery</hi> I ſaw one Warehouſe, or Booth, conſiſting of ſix Apartments all belonging to a Dealer in <hi>Norwich</hi> Stuffs only, who, they ſaid, had there above 20,000<hi>l.</hi> Value in thoſe Goods.</p>
            <p>Weſtern Goods had their Share here alſo, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Booths were filled with Serges, Duroys, Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, Shalloons, Cantaloons, <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Kerſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Exeter, Taunton, Briſtol,</hi> and other Parts Weſt, and ſome from <hi>London</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>But all this is ſtill out-done, at leaſt in Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by two Articles, which are the Peculiars of this Fair, and are not exhibited till the other Part of the Fair, <hi>for the Woollen Manufacture,</hi> begins to cloſe up: Theſe are the WOOLL, and the HOPS. There is ſcarce any Price fixed for Hops in <hi>England,</hi> till they know how they ſell at <hi>Sturbridge-fair</hi>; the Quantity that appears in the Fair is indeed prodigious, and they take up a large Part of the Field, on which the Fair is kept, to themſelves; they are brought directly from <hi>Chelmsford</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> from <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and from <hi>Farnham</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi>; beſides what are brought from <hi>London,</hi> of the Growth of thoſe and other Places.</p>
            <p>Inquiring why this Fair ſhould be thus, of all other Places in <hi>England,</hi> the Centre of that Trade, and ſo great a Quantity of ſo bulky a Commodity be carried thither ſo far; I was informed by one thoroughly acquainted with that Matter, That Hops, for this Part of <hi>England,</hi> grow principally in the two Counties of <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> with an Exception only to the Town of <hi>Chelmsford</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and there are very few planted any-where elſe.</p>
            <p>There are indeed in the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> ſome Hops growing; as at <hi>Wilton,</hi> near <hi>Saliſbury</hi>; at <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Broomſgrove,</hi> near <hi>Wales,</hi> and the like; but the Quantity is inconſiderable, and the Places ſo remote, that none of them come to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0141100401:94"/>Formerly in the North of <hi>England,</hi> few Hops were uſed, their Drink being chiefly pale ſmooth Ale, which required but little Hops; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they planted none North of <hi>Trent.</hi> But as for ſome Years paſt, they not only brew great Quantities of Beer in the North, but alſo uſe Hops in the Brewing their Ale much more than they did before, ſo they all come South of <hi>Trent</hi> to buy their Hops; and here being vaſt Quantities brought, 'tis great Part of their back Carriage into <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and <hi>Northamptonſhire, Derbyſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and all thoſe Counties; nay, of late, ſince the Union, even ſo far as <hi>Scotland</hi>; for I muſt not omit here alſo to mention, that the River <hi>Grant,</hi> or <hi>Cam,</hi> which runs cloſe by the North-weſt Side of the Fair, in its Courſe from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>Ely,</hi> is navigable; and that by this means, all heavy Goods are brought to the Fair-field, by Water-carriage from <hi>London,</hi> and other Parts; firſt to the Port of <hi>Lynn,</hi> and then in Barges up the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> from the <hi>Ouſe</hi> into the <hi>Cam,</hi> and ſo to the very Edge of the Fair.</p>
            <p>In like manner great Quantities of heavy Goods, and Hops among the reſt, are ſent from the Fair to <hi>Lynn</hi> by Water, and ſhipped there for the <hi>Humber,</hi> to <hi>Hull, York,</hi> &amp;c. and for <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tyne,</hi> and by <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now, as they do not yet plant Hops in the North, tho' the Conſumption there is great and increaſing daily, this is one Reaſon why at <hi>Sturbridge-fair</hi> there is ſo great a Demand for them: beſides, there were very few Hops, if any worth naming, growing in all the Counties even on this ſide <hi>Trent,</hi> above 40 Miles from <hi>London,</hi> thoſe Counties depending on <hi>Sturbridge-fair</hi> for their Supply; ſo the Counties of <hi>Suffolk, Norfolk, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, Huntingdon, Northampton, Lincoln, Leiceſter, Rutland,</hi> and even to <hi>Stafford, Warwick</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire,</hi> bought moſt of, if not all, their Hops at <hi>Sturbridge-fair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0141100401:95"/>This is a Teſtimony of the prodigious Reſort of the trading People of all Parts of <hi>England</hi> to this Fair; where ſurpriſing Quantities of Hops formerly have been ſold.</p>
            <p>The Article of Wooll is of ſeveral Sorts; but principally Fleece Wooll, out of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> where the longeſt Staple is found, the Sheep of thoſe Parts being of the largeſt Breed.</p>
            <p>The Buyers are chiefly the Manufacturers of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and it is a prodigious Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity they buy.</p>
            <p>Here I ſaw what I have not obſerved in any other County of <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>Pocket</hi> of Wooll, which ſeems to have been at firſt called ſo in Mockery, this <hi>Pocket</hi> being ſo big, that it loads a whole Waggon, and reaches beyond the moſt extreme Parts of it, hanging over both before and behind; and theſe ordinarily weigh a Ton or 2500 <abbr>lb.</abbr> Weight of Wooll, all in one Bag.</p>
            <p>The Quantity of Wooll only, which has been ſold at this Place at one Fair, has been ſaid to amount to 50 or 60,000<hi>l.</hi> in Value; ſome ſay, a great deal more.</p>
            <p>By theſe Articles a Stranger may make ſome Gueſs at the immenſe Trade which is carried on at this Place; what prodigious Quantities of Goods are bought and ſold, and what a vaſt Concourſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſeen here from all Parts of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might proceed to ſpeak of ſeveral other Sorts of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures, which are brought hither to be ſold; as all Sorts of wrought Iron, and Braſs Ware from <hi>Birmingham</hi>; edged Tools, Knives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Sheffield,</hi> Glaſs Wares, and Stockens, from <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter</hi>; and unaccountable Quantities of other Things of ſmaller Value every Morning.</p>
            <p>To attend this Fair, and the prodigious Crouds of People which reſort to it, there are ſometimes no
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0141100401:96"/>
leſs than 50 Hackney Coaches, which come from <hi>London,</hi> and ply Night and Morning to carry the People to and from <hi>Cambridge</hi>; for there the Groſs of them lodge; nay, which is ſtill more ſtrange, there are Wherries brought from <hi>London</hi> on Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, to ply upon the little River <hi>Cam,</hi> and to row People up and down, from the Town, and from the Fair, as Occaſion preſents.</p>
            <p>It is not to be wondered at, if the Town of <hi>Cambridge</hi> cannot receive or entertain the Numbers of People that come to this Fair; for not <hi>Cambridge</hi> only, but all the Towns round are full; nay, the very Barns and Stables are turned into Inns, to lodge the meaner Sort of People: As for the Fair People, they all eat, drink, and ſleep in their Booths, which are ſo intermingled with Taverns, Coffee-houſes, Drinking-houſes, Eating-houſes, Cooks Shops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo many Butchers and Higglers from all the neighbouring Counties come in every Morning with Beef, Mutton, Fowls, Butter, Bread, Cheeſe, Eggs, and ſuch Things, and go with them from Tent to Tent, from Door to Door, that there's no Want of Proviſions of any Kind, either dreſſed, or undreſſed.</p>
            <p>In a Word, the Fair is like a well-governed City, and there is the leaſt Diſorder and Confuſion (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) that can be ſeen any-where, with ſo great a Concourſe of People.</p>
            <p>Towards the latter End of the Fair, and when the great Hurry of Wholeſale Buſineſs begins to be over, the Gentry come in, from all Parts of the County round; and tho' they come for their Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet 'tis not a little Money they lay out, which generally falls to the Share of the Retalers; ſuch as the Toy-ſhops, Goldſmiths, Braſiers, Ironmongers, Turners, Milaners, Mercers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome looſe Corns they reſerve for the Puppet-ſhews, Drolls, Rope-dancers, and ſuch-like; of which there is no
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0141100401:97"/>
Want. The laſt Day of the Fair is the <hi>Horſe-fair,</hi> where the Whole is cloſed both with Horſe and Foot-races, to divert the meaner Sort of People only; for nothing conſiderable is offered of that Kind, and the late Act, I preſume, muſt have put an End to the former. Thus ends the whole Fair, and in leſs than a Week more, ſcarce any Sign is left, that ſuch a thing has been there, except by the Heaps of Dung and Straw, and other Rubbiſh which is left behind, trod into the Earth, and is as good as a Summer's Fallow for the Land; and as I have ſaid above, pays the Huſbandman well for the Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have mentioned, that here is a Court of Juſtice always open, and held every Day in a Shed built on purpoſe in the Fair: this is for keeping the Peace, and deciding Controverſies in Matters ariſing from the Buſineſs of the Fair. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the Town of <hi>Cambridge</hi> are Judges in this Court, as being in their Juriſdiction, or they holding it by ſpecial Privilege. Here they determine Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a ſummary way, as is practiſed in thoſe we call <hi>Pye-Powder Courts</hi> in other Places, or as a <hi>Court of Conſcience</hi>; and they have a final Authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Appeal.</p>
            <p>Having juſt mentioned the Puppet-ſhews, Drolls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with which the People are entertained during the Time of this Fair, I cannot but relate a deplorable Accident that happened on this Occaſion, at <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welt</hi> in this Neighbourhood, as follows.</p>
            <p>On the 8th of <hi>September,</hi> 1727. about Eight at Night, a Puppet-ſhew being to be acted in a Barn built of <hi>Barnwell</hi> Stone, and thatched with Straw, a Fellow attempted to thruſt himſelf in without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but being refuſed, and the Door locked, and, as ſome report, nailed, to keep out Intruders, the Villain threatened he would ſet the Barn on Fire over their Heads, in Revenge. There was a Place ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to the Barn, where were Hay and Straw; and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0141100401:98"/>
a Boy ſetting down a wooden Lantern with a ſhort Candle in it at a little Diſtance, whilſt he was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thro' a Hole at the Sight, the villainous Fellow aforeſaid beat the Lantern about, till the Fire took the Straw, which he left burning, and run away. There was a Floor above them, and the Flame, getting into the falſe Roof, ſpread like Wildfire. The People, in the utmoſt Conſternation, all making to the Door, which opened inwards, fell upon one another, and became, as it were, ſo many Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes to hinder its being opened: and juſt at this fatal Criſis, the Fire having ſeized ſome, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shrieks and Cries reſounding from all, the Floor fell in, and ſmothered almoſt all; for not above five or ſix eſcaped of the Whole, and about 120 Men, Women, and Children, miſerably periſhed. The next Day it was one of the moſt ſhocking Sights that ever was beheld, to ſee the Relations of the unhappy Perſons flocking thither, to find and own the Bodies, ſome of their Brothers, ſome of their Children, ſome of their Wives and Huſbands, which they found Difficulty enough to diſcover; for ſome of them had their Heads burnt off, ſome their Legs, ſome their Hands and Arms, and others, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, conſumed to Aſhes. And at laſt, moſt of the mangled Bodies were carried in Carts, and put pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly into a large Hole dug in the Church-yard for that Purpoſe. Among the unfortunate Sufferers were ſeveral young Gentlewomen of conſiderable Fortunes. About four Years after this, another terrible Fire happened, which almoſt conſumed the whole Town of <hi>Barnwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within theſe few Years, a fine Road, of about four Miles in Length, is completed, from the Town of <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>Hogmagog-hills</hi>; which, by reaſon of the Badneſs of the Way in that Place, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding uſeful Benefaction to the Town; which generous Work was done in purſuance of the Will
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0141100401:99"/>
of <hi>William Wortes,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as I think they told me the Gentleman's Name was.</p>
            <p>The Two Univerſities of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> are ſo much the Glory of this Nation, that it would be an almoſt unpardonable Defect in me, not to take particular Notice of them. I ſhall refer that of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to its proper Place; and here give as brief an Account as I can of this of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and of the Originals and Founders of the ſeveral Colleges, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Favours and Advantages that have been within theſe few Years conferred upon it by his late Majeſty, and other Benefactors.</p>
            <p>The Town is governed by a Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but with regard to the Government of the Univerſity, that has a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> eligible every three Years, <hi>aut manere in eodem Officio durante tacito conſenſu Senatus Cantabr.</hi> He hath under him a <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> who holds a Court of Record of Civil Cauſes for all privileged Perſons and Scholars, under the Degree of Maſter of Arts.</p>
            <p>They have alſo a <hi>High Steward,</hi> choſen by the Senate, and holding by Patent from the Univerſity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> is annually choſen on the 4th of <hi>November,</hi> by the Body of the Univerſity, out of Two Perſons nominated by the Heads of Colleges.</p>
            <p>Two <hi>Proctors</hi> are alſo annually choſen, as at <hi>Oxford</hi>; as alſo are Two <hi>Taxers,</hi> who, with the Proctors, have Cognizance of Weights and Meaſures, as Clerks of the Market.</p>
            <p>The Univerſity has alſo a <hi>Cuſtos Archivorum,</hi> or <hi>Regiſter</hi>; Three <hi>Eſquire Beadles,</hi> One <hi>Yeoman Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi> and a <hi>Library-keeper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vice-chancellor ſometimes viſits the Taverns and other Publick-houſes in his own Perſon: but the Proctors do it very frequently, and have Power to puniſh offending Scholars, and to fine the Publick-houſes who entertain them after Eight at Night in the Winter, or Nine in Summer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0141100401:100"/>As to the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Univerſity of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>; the Story goes, That <hi>Cantaber,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> 270 Years before Chriſt, firſt founded it; and that <hi>Sebert,</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> reſtored it, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 630. Afterwards, as the learned <hi>Camden</hi> obſerves, it lay a long time neglected, and was overthrown by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Storms, till all Things revived under the <hi>Norman</hi> Government. Soon after Inns, Hoſtels, and Halls were built for Students, tho' without Endowments. There are now 16 Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Halls, which differ only in Name, being equally endowed and privileged; 16 Maſters, 406 Fellowſhips; about 662 Scholarſhips, 236 Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions; and the whole Number of Maſters, Fellows, Scholars, Exhibitioners, and other Students, are about 1500.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now give a brief Account of the Colleges, and begin with</p>
            <p n="1">
               <label>1. PETER-HOUSE.</label>
Which was founded by <hi>Hugh Balſham,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely, Anno</hi> 1257, when only Prior of <hi>Ely.</hi> But at firſt the Scholars had no other Conveniences than Chambers, which exempted them from the high Rates impoſed on them by the Townſmen for Lodgings. The Endowment was ſettled by the ſame <hi>Hugh</hi> when Biſhop, <hi>Anno</hi> 1284, for a Maſter, 14 Fellows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Number might be increaſed or diminiſhed according to the Improvement or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of their Revenues.

               <label>2. CLARE-HALL</label>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0141100401:101"/>
by Fire. The Founder, finding the Charge of Rebuilding would exceed his Abilities, had the kind Aſſiſtance of the ſaid Lady, thro' whoſe Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality it was not only rebuilt, but endowed. It has been lately new-built, all of Free-ſtone, and is one of the neateſt and moſt uniform Houſes in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and delightfully ſituated on the Banks of the River, which forms for it a Kind of natural Canal.</p>

This aroſe out of Two Guilds or Fraternities, one of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> and the other of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> which after a long Emulation, being united into one Body, by a joint Intereſt built this College, which took its Name from the adjoining Church of <hi>St. Benedict.</hi> Their greateſt modern Benefactor was Dr. <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> once Maſter of the College, and afterwards Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who by his prudent Management recovered ſeveral Rights of the College; and, beſides Two Fellowſhips, and Five Scholarſhips, gave a great Number of excellent MSS. to their Library, which were moſtly collected out of the Remains of the old Abbey-Libraries, Colleges, and Cathedrals, and chiefly relate to the Hiſtory of <hi>England.</hi>

               <label>5. TRINITY-HALL</label>
Was founded about the Year 1353, by <hi>William Bateman,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich.</hi> It was built upon a Place which once belonged to the Monks of <hi>Ely,</hi> and was a Houſe for Students before the Time of Biſhop <hi>Bateman,</hi> who by Exchange for the Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of certain Rectories, got it into his own Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. He was a great Maſter of Civil and Canon Law; whereupon the Maſter, two Fellows, and three Scholars, (the Number appointed by him at the firſt Foundation) were obliged to follow thoſe two Studies.

               <label>7. KING'S COLLEGE</label>
Was founded in the Year 1451, by King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. It was at firſt but ſmall, being built by that Prince for a Rector and 12 Scholars only. Near it was a little Hoſtel for Grammarians, built by <hi>William Bingham,</hi> which was granted by the Founder to King <hi>Henry,</hi> for the Inlargement of his College. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he united theſe two, and having inlarged them by adding the Church of <hi>St. John Zachary,</hi> founded a College for a Provoſt, 70 Fellows and Scholars, three Chaplains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Chapel belonging to this College is deſervedly reckoned one of the fineſt Buildings of its Kind in the World. It is 304 Feet
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0141100401:103"/>
long, 73 broad, and 91 high to the Battlements, and has not one Pillar in it. It has 12 large Windows on each Side, finely painted, and the Carving, and other Workmanſhip of the numerous Stalls, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes any thing of the Kind. It conſtitutes one Side of a large Square; for the Royal Founder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, that the College ſhould be a Quadrangle, all of equal Beauty: but the Civil Wars in which he was involved with the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> prevented his accompliſhing it; and the Proſecution of his good Deſign was reſerved to our own Time; for what has been added within theſe few Years paſt, is not only an Ornament to the College, but to the whole Univerſity: and it is to be hoped, that the College will be enabled, in Time, to finiſh the noble Work. This new Part runs from the Weſt-end of the Chapel, a little detached from it to the Southward, and makes another Side of the Square, and contains ſpacious Chambers and Apartments, being 236 Feet in Length, and 46 in Breadth, built with great Regularity, and modern Beauty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Febr.</hi> 1734, the Workmen digging for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the new Buildings of this College, found a great Number of Broad Pieces of Gold, of the Coin of King <hi>Henry</hi> V. exceeding fair. As ſoon as it was known, the Governors of the College got out of the Workmens Hands a conſiderable Number, which they made Preſents of to their particular Benefactors, and divided among themſelves, and the Fellows of the College; but it is ſuppoſed, that the Workmen ſecreted many; for this Coin was very ſcarce before, but after this was much eaſier to be met with.</p>

This College, pleaſantly ſituated by the River, is no leſs remarkable for its Number of Students, and its beautiful Groves and Gardens, than for its ſtrict and regular Diſcipline. It has a noble Library, which has been of late Years greatly augmented, by the Acceſſion of the Library of Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who bequeathed the ſame to it.</p>

But tho' this College owes its Riſe to the Bequeſt of this Lady, and the Care of her Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, it is exceedingly improved by the Benefactions of Sir <hi>Francis Clerk,</hi> who beſides erecting a Set of new Buildings, augmented the Scholarſhips, and founded four Fellowſhips with eight Scholarſhips more; and moreover Sir <hi>John Brereton</hi> left to it above 2000<hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Sixteen Colleges or <hi>Halls</hi> in this Univerſity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>New Senate-houſe</hi> is a fine Edifice, and with the Schools, the Univerſity-Library, and ſome other Buildings intended to be erected oppoſite to it, will form a ſtately Quadrangle. It is in Length 101 Feet, and in Breadth 42; and is adorned with fluted Pillars, a triangular Pediment, and other beautiful Decorations.</p>
            <p>The Schools of this Univerſity were at firſt in private Houſes, hired from Ten Years to Ten Years for that Purpoſe, by the Univerſity, in which Time they might not be put to any other Uſe. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Publick Schools were built at the Charge of the Univerſity, in or near the Place where they now ſtand; but the preſent Fabrick, as it is now built of Brick and rough Stone, was erected partly at the Expence of the Univerſity, and partly by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of ſeveral Benefactors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Univerſity Library</hi> was firſt built by <hi>Rothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> who, with <hi>Tonſtal</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> furniſhed it with choice Books; few whereof are to be found at preſent.

nevertheleſs about 14000 Books, when his late Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> I. was graciouſly pleaſed, in the Beginning of his Reign, to purchaſe the large and curious Library of Dr. <hi>John Moor,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who died <hi>July</hi> 30. 1714; and as a Mark of his Royal Favour, to beſtow it upon this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</p>
            <p>There have been very lately great Additions and Alterations made in the Library, for the better Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this valuable Royal Preſent, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of upwards of 30,000 Volumes, and coſt the King 6000 Guineas.

            <p>This great King was not contented with having given this noble Inſtance of his Royal Bounty to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but in the Year 1724 was graciouſly pleaſed to confer another Mark of his Favour upon them, and which extended not only to that, but to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi>; in creating a new Eſtabliſhment in a moſt uſeful Branch of Learning, which was much wanted, and for which till then there had been no Proviſion: which was to appoint two Perſons not under the Degree of Maſter of Arts, or Batchelor of Laws, ſkilled in Modern Hiſtory, and in the Knowledge of Modern Languages, to be nominated King's Profeſſors of Modern Hiſtory, one for the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the other for that of <hi>Oxford</hi>; who are obliged to read Lectures in the Publick Schools, at parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Times, each of which Profeſſors to have a

Stipend of 400<hi>l. per Annum</hi>; out of which each Profeſſor is obliged to maintain, with ſufficient Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Two Perſons at leaſt, well qualified to teach and inſtruct in writing and ſpeaking the ſaid Languages <hi>gratis,</hi> Twenty Scholars of each Univerſity, to be nominated by the King, each of which is obliged to learn Two, at leaſt, of the ſaid Languages.</p>
            <p>The ſame excellent Prince alſo was pleaſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Twelve Perſons, choſen out of each of the Univerſities, to be Preachers in the Royal Chapel of <hi>Whitehall,</hi> at ſtated Times, with handſome Salaries; and declared that he would cauſe a particular Regard to be had to the Members of the Two Univerſities in the Diſpoſitions of thoſe Benefices which fell in the Royal Gift.</p>
            <p>Some other Benefactions to this Univerſity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few Years paſt, are as follow.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>John Woodward,</hi> who died <hi>April</hi> 25. 1728, left to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> a Sum of Money, for erecting a Profeſſorſhip for <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> with a Proviſion of 150<hi>l. per Annum</hi> for the Support and Maintenance of the ſame for ever. He likewiſe bequeathed to the ſaid Univerſity his Collection of Foſſils, and other natural Curioſities, and ſuch a Part of his Library moreover, as was neceſſary to illuſtrate his ſaid Collection.</p>
            <p>On the Death of Mrs. <hi>Addenbroke (Mar.</hi> 1720) Widow of an eminent Phyſician of that Name, the Sum of about 4000<hi>l.</hi> devolved to this Univerſity; which, by the Doctor's Will, is to be applied to the Building and Furniſhing a Phyſical Hoſpital in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> in which poor diſeaſed People are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for Cure, <hi>gratis.</hi> The Maſter and Fellows of <hi>Catharine-hall</hi> are appointed Truſtees of this Charity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here enter into the puerile Diſpute, (which has ſo much engaged ſeveral learned Pens, that might have been better employed) whether this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0141100401:111"/>
Univerſity, or that of <hi>Oxford,</hi> is the moſt ancient. Their Emulation ought to be more worthily founded; and indeed they have ſo much to boaſt, as to the great and ſhining Ornaments they have reſpectively produced to Church and State, and the Figure they make in the Commonwealth of Learning, that it is ſtrange ſo trifling a Contention ſhould have been ſo warmly maintained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambridge-caſtle</hi> was built by <hi>William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,</hi> as one of thoſe many which he erected in divers Parts, to curb his newly conquered People. It was ſtrong and ſtately, and had in it, among other ſpacious Apartments, a moſt magnificent Hall. This being neglected, the Stones and Timber of it were afterwards begged of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. by the Maſter and Fellows of <hi>King's-hall,</hi> towards the Building of their Chapel. Nothing is now ſtanding but the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, which is the Priſon, and an artificial high Hill of a ſteep Aſcent, and level at Top.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Cambridge</hi> is very large, moſt of its Streets are narrow, the Houſes very ill-built, and the greateſt Part of them much out of Repair; ſo that, were it not for the Colleges, and other publick Edifices, it would make a very mean Appearance.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cambridge</hi> the Road lies North-weſt, on the Edge of the Fens, to <hi>Huntingdon</hi>; on which ſtands the little Market-town of <hi>Caxton,</hi> remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Birth-place of <hi>Caxton,</hi> the firſt Printer in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Way paſſes from <hi>Arington</hi> S. E. thro' <hi>Holm</hi> into this Town, and ſo on to <hi>Papworth,</hi> higher up on the ſame Road; which three laſt-mentioned Places are Villages only. On this Side, 'tis all an agreeable Corn Country, adorned with ſeveral Seats of Gentleman; but the chief is <hi>Wimple-Hall,</hi> formerly built at a vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, by the late Earl of <hi>Radnor.</hi> It was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bought by his Grace <hi>John Holles Cavendiſh,</hi> late Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>; in a Partition of whoſe vaſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0141100401:112"/>
Eſtate, it fell to <hi>Edward</hi> late Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Mortimer,</hi> in Right of his Lady, the only Daughter of the ſaid Duke; who brought the Earl this Eſtate, and many others, ſufficient to denominate her one of the richeſt Heireſſes in <hi>Great Britain</hi>; but his Lordſhip parted with, it a little before his Death, to the Right Hon. the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hardwick,</hi> who now poſſeſſes it. It is ſituated in a very dirty Country; and notwithſtanding the Coſt beſtowed upon it from its firſt Owner to this Time, the Gardens and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are both in a very bad Taſte.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cambridge,</hi> my Deſign obliging me, and the direct Road in part concurring, I came back thro' the Weſt Side of the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to <hi>Saffron-Walden,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Linton,</hi> a ſmall Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town of no Note, ſaying that a <hi>Roman</hi> Military Way falls into the <hi>Ikening</hi> here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saffron-Walden</hi> is a fair Town, with a good Church, where ſtands a Monument of the Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> Chancellor to King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. who made him a Grant of certain Lands belonging to a diſſolved Monaſtery near this Town, which takes its Name from the great Quantities of Saffron which formerly grew in the Grounds, and were cultivated here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and anſwered exceeding well in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing; but how it came into Decay, nobody could account to me, though there may be ſtill ſeen a great many Acres of Saffron-ground about this Town. This Commodity was never known to grow in <hi>England,</hi> till the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. This Town gives Title of Baron to the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whoſe eldeſt Son is by Courteſy called Lord <hi>Walden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near this Town, on the Side of <hi>Cambridge</hi> Road, ſtands the noble and ſtately Palace of <hi>Audley-Inn,</hi> on <hi>Audley-end,</hi> formerly the largeſt Palace of any in <hi>England</hi>; and tho' a great Part of it has been pulled down, is ſtill one of the moſt magnificent Structures
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0141100401:113"/>
in the whole Kingdom. It was built out of the Ruins of the above-mentioned Monaſtery, by <hi>Thomas</hi> ſecond Son of <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who married the only Daughter and Heir of the afore-named Lord <hi>Audley.</hi> This <hi>Thomas</hi> was ſummoned into Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, as Lord <hi>Audley</hi> of <hi>Walden</hi>; and was afterwards created Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> by King <hi>James</hi> I. to whom he was firſt Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and afterwards Lord High-Treaſurer. It was deſigned for a Royal Palace for that King, and when it was finiſhed with all the Elegance and Politeneſs of Taſte of the Times, the King was invited to ſee it; and as he paſſed to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> he took up a Night's Lodging there. And after having viewed it with great Surpriſe and Aſtoniſhment, the Earl aſked him, How he approved of it? Who anſwer'd, Very well. But troth, Man, ſaid he, 'tis <hi>too much</hi> for a <hi>King</hi>; but it may <hi>do</hi> for a <hi>Lord High-Treaſurer</hi>; and ſo left it upon the Earl's Hands, who is reported to have had then an Eſtate of 50,000<hi>l.</hi> a Year, which has been gradually decaying ever ſince, and is now reduced to about 3000<hi>l.</hi> a Year with Incumbrances upon it. King <hi>Charles</hi> II. purchaſed this Houſe, and ſo it became, what it was originally deſigned for, a Royal Palace. The King mortgaged the Hearth-tax to the Earl, to anſwer the Purchaſe-money; and appointed <hi>James,</hi> then Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Houſe-keeper thereof, with a Salary of 1000<hi>l.</hi> a Year; which Office continued in the Family till the Revolution, when the Hearth-tax was aboliſhed. And the Exigence of the State being ſuch as it could not afford to pay the Purchaſe-money, King <hi>William</hi> III. regranted the ſaid Houſe to the Family; upon which <hi>Henry,</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> (who in his Father's Life-time was created Earl of <hi>Bindon,</hi> to qualify him to hold the Marſhal's Staff) pull'd down a great Part of this noble Edifice, and reduced it conſiderably. And yet it is ſtill very large, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0141100401:114"/>
makes a grand Appearance. You enter in at a large wide Pair of Iron Gates into a moſt ſpacious Court-yard, on each Side of which was formerly a Row of Cloyſters, in which ſtood the Out-offices belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Houſe; which have been all pulled down, and ſupplied with a Stone Wall. You paſs in at the Fore-front, thro' Part of the Houſe, into a large open Quadrangle, incloſed by four different Parts of the Houſe, and almoſt ſurrounded with Cloyſters. The Apartments above and below are very lofty and ſpacious; and there is a very long wide Gallery, which extends the whole Length of the Back-front of the Houſe. The Gardens are very indifferent, but very capable of Improvement. Behind the Houſe is a fine Park, extending to <hi>Saffron-Walden,</hi> well ſtored with Deer, but not over-burdened with Timber; in which there is a riſing Spot of Ground, whereon if the Houſe had been erected, it would have had a much better Effect as to Proſpect; for its preſent Situation is low, neither are the Grounds about it very fertile, or, I think, healthy.</p>
            <p>But however great and magnificent this noble Houſe appears, it bears an indelible Stain, if what is ſaid be true, That it was built with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold, upon the Ruin of the Great and Learned <hi>Ralegh,</hi> who fell by the Revenge of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Arts of <hi>Gundamor,</hi> the Avarice of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the unpardonable Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own King. But the preſent Earl's Mind is more nobly endowed than that of his great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, as being a generous and truly charitable Nobleman, which he has teſtified by many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Acts among his poor Neighbours, eſpecially during the great Froſt in the Winter of 1739.</p>
            <p>At a little Town called <hi>Littlebury,</hi> not far from <hi>Audley-Inn,</hi> is a Houſe which was erected by the famous Mr. <hi>Winſtanley,</hi> who built <hi>Eddy-ſtone</hi> Light-houſe, and periſhed in it, as I ſhall mention in its Place. Here he had made many odd Contrivances
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0141100401:115"/>
of Chairs running on Springs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which uſually much ſurpriſed Strangers, who came to ſee the Houſe. The Perſon appointed to ſhew it generally placed the greateſt Stranger into a particular Chair, which, on touching the Spring, ran backward thro' the Houſe into the Garden. The ſame Gentleman was famous alſo for his Water-works, full of whimſical, but ingenious Contrivances.</p>
            <p>But I ought not to omit, that near <hi>Icleton</hi> and <hi>Strethal,</hi> upon the River <hi>Cam,</hi> lies <hi>Cheſterford</hi>; where, in the Year 1719, were diſcovered the <hi>Veſtigia</hi> of a <hi>Roman</hi> City. The Foundation of the Walls is very apparent quite round, tho' level with the Ground, including about 50 Acres. Great Part of it ſerves for a Cauſeway to the publick <hi>Cambridge</hi> Road from <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Crown Inn</hi> is built upon it. In the North-weſt End of the Town is the Foundation of a <hi>Roman</hi> Temple. Many <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Coins have been found in the <hi>Borough-field,</hi> as they term the antient City, whoſe Name was <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boritum,</hi> according to Dr. <hi>Stukely.</hi> In this Pariſh, they ſay, has been a Royal Manor. Not far off, by <hi>Audley-Inn,</hi> is a great <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, upon an Eminence, where now ſtands an Hunting-tower of Brick.</p>
            <p>A little North of this Part of the Country riſes the River <hi>Stour,</hi> which, for a Courſe of fifty Miles or more, parts the two Counties of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi>; paſſing thro' or near <hi>Haveril, Clare, Cavendiſh, Halſted, Sudbury, Buers, Nayland, Stretford, Ded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Manningtree,</hi> and into the Sea at <hi>Harwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we came on this Side, we ſaw at a Diſtance <hi>Braintree</hi> and <hi>Bocking,</hi> two large and populous Towns, which join together, being parted by a little Stream of Water. Theſe were formerly very rich and flouriſhing, occaſioned by the great Trade for Bays, which were manufactured in ſuch Quantities in theſe two Towns, as to ſend weekly to <hi>London</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0141100401:116"/>
Four, Five, or Six Waggons laden with them; but this Trade having greatly decreaſed in a few Years, the Inhabitants are in a very miſerable Condition at preſent; for by an Increaſe of their Poor, their Pariſh Rates are riſen ſo high, as in the Year 1738 the Poors Rate in <hi>Bocking</hi> Pariſh was Nine Shillings in the Pound; which, together with their other Rates and Taxes, rendered it very burdenſome to all the Inhabitants: and at the ſame time, the Small Pox having infeſted both the Towns, their Markets were almoſt deſerted by the Country People. The Pariſh of <hi>Bocking</hi> is a Deanery, and the living is valued at upwards of 500<hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near <hi>Braintree</hi> is the Pariſh of <hi>Black Notely,</hi> in which are a few ſcattered Houſes, ſcarcely worth noticing, except for the Memory of the late learned Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> who reſided many Years in this Place, and was buried in the Church-yard, over whoſe Grave a Monument was erected, with an Inſcription in <hi>Latin</hi>; which being long, we ſhall refer the Learned to the Original, and content ourſelves with giving the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the ſake of our common Readers, and in regard to ſo great a Man, who was an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Country. It may be thus rendered:</p>

                  <p>"The mortal Part of the moſt learned <hi>John Ray,</hi> A. M. is depoſited in this narrow Tomb; but his Writings are not confined to one Nation; and his Fame, every-where moſt illuſtrious, renders them immortal. Formerly he was Fellow of <hi>Trinity-College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and of the Royal Society in <hi>London,</hi> a ſingular Ornament of both. In every kind of Science, as well divine as human, moſt expert. And, like a ſecond <hi>Solomon,</hi> (to whom alone, perhaps, he was inferior) from the Cedar to the Hyſſop, from the largeſt of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals to the ſmalleſt Inſects, he arrived at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Knowledge. And not only did he moſt accurately diſcourſe of Plants ſpread over the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0141100401:117"/>
Face of the whole Earth; but, making a moſt ſtrict Search, even into its inmoſt Bowels, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſerved Diſcuſſion throughout all Nature, he deſcrib'd. While on his Travels abroad, he dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently diſcovered what had eſcaped the Obſervation of others, and firſt brought to Light many things moſt worthy of Remark. Further than this, he was endowed with ſo unaffected a manner of Behaviour, that he was learned without Pedant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; of a ſublime Genius, and at the ſame time (which is rarely known) of an humble and modeſt Diſpoſition. Not diſtinguiſhed by an illuſtrious Extraction; but (what is greater) by his own Virtue. Little ſolicitous about obtaining Wealth and Titles, he choſe rather to deſerve than to poſſeſs them. Content with his own Lot, he grew old in a private Station, worthy a more ample Fortune. In every other reſpect he readily obſerved Moderation; in Study, none.</p>
                  <p>"To conclude: To all theſe Perfections he added a Piety free from Artifice; bearing an intire and hearty Veneration for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which he confirmed with his laſt Breath. Thus, happily, in a virtuous Retirement, lived he, whom the preſent Age reveres, and Poſterity will admire."</p>

               <hi>N.B.</hi> This Monument beginning to want Repair, by ſtanding expoſed in the Church-yard, hath been lately removed, and ſet up in the Chancel of <hi>Black Notely</hi> Church. To the former Epitaph is added, on the Table on the Eaſt-ſide, a <hi>Latin</hi> Inſcription, which may be thus rendered:</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0141100401:118"/>The Country hereabout is very pleaſant, having many Riſings and Falls, with great Plenty of Water. The Fields are well cultivated, ſo as to render the whole Face of the Country like a Garden. But what is often very ſurpriſing to Strangers, is, the Nakedneſs of moſt of the large Trees growing in their Hedge Rows, and on the Sides of the Road, even in the Month of <hi>May</hi>; at which time few of them have put out any Leaves; but, upon Inquiry, I found they were a peculiar Sort of Elm, which rarely puts out Leaves before the Middle of <hi>May</hi>; and this is one of the moſt common Trees of this Country.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Braintree</hi> is <hi>Felſted,</hi> a ſmall Place, but noted for a flouriſhing Free-School, of an antient Foundation.</p>
            <p>Near to this is the Priory of <hi>Lees,</hi> which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before (<hi>P.</hi> 20.); and hence keeping the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Road, I came to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> mentioned alſo before, and <hi>Ingateſtone,</hi> five Miles Weſt, which I mention again, as I promiſed, (<hi>Pag.</hi> 20.) to have an Opportunity to ſpeak of the noble Family of Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> and of the Improvements making at his Seat near this Place, by the preſent Lord, who is a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of fine Taſte, and great Qualities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ingateſtone-hall,</hi> one of his Lordſhip's Seats, lies at a ſmall Diſtance from the publick Road, on the Right-hand, about a Quarter of a Mile ſhort of <hi>Ingateſtone</hi> Town.</p>
            <p>The Houſe is ſituated very low, ſo as not to be ſeen at a ſmall Diſtance. It is a very large, irregular Building, and the Gardens are old; tho' there were many Alterations made in them for the better, by the preſent Lord, before he came of Age; but as this was not the Seat where he intended to reſide, ſo his Lordſhip did not employ his fine Genius in modelling of theſe Gardens; but his whole Thoughts were bent to embelliſh his noble Seat at <hi>Thorndon,</hi> which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0141100401:119"/>
is ſituated on a riſing Ground, about three Miles on the Right-hand of <hi>Brentwood</hi> in <hi>Eſſex:</hi> where his Lordſhip has been ſome Years laying of a Plan for a Houſe and Gardens, which when executed, will be an Honour to the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Houſe, when finiſhed, will be 265 Feet in Front, excluſive of the Offices. The principal Front is to the South-eaſt Aſpect, where is deſigned a ſpacious Court. Before this is deſigned a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race-walk near 200 Feet broad, and of a great Length; on the other Side of this, will be a Lawn of Graſs, containing near 200 Acres of Land, which is bounded by Plantations of Trees, and handſome Farms.</p>
            <p>On the Back-front of the Houſe is a noble Range of Stoves, for tender Exotick Plants; which when finiſhed will far exceed whatever has been done of this Nature, even by the greateſt Princes in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Park, which lies on the North-eaſt and North-weſt Side of the Houſe, is very large, and well ſtocked with Timber, which, fully grown, adds greatly to the Beauty of the Place. In many Parts of this Park are large Incloſures, which have been made by the preſent Lord, and are converted to Nurſeries, which are completely ſtored with all Trees and Shrubs, that will live in the open Air in this Climate; ſo that when theſe Trees are planted out, according to his Lordſhip's Deſign, it will be the moſt beautiful and complete Plantation perhaps in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thro' the Park there is already an Avenue cut, leading from <hi>Brentwood</hi> to the Houſe, three Miles in Length; on each Side of it are deſigned Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Trees, in regular Clumps, which, when finiſhed, will have a noble Effect, as People paſs thro', up to the Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0141100401:120"/>The Kitchen-garden is already finiſhed, and laid out with equal Elegance and Uſefulneſs. This is ſituated behind the Offices, ſo that it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Sight from the Houſe, and is detached from the other Gardens; and thereby is not expoſed to Strangers, who may have Admittance to walk thro' the Pleaſure-garden and Plantations.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the whole Plan is the moſt extenſive and grand of any yet executed in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In the Pariſh-church of <hi>Ingateſtone</hi> are to be ſeen the Monuments of his Lordſhip's Anceſtors, who by a conſtant Series of beneficent Actions to the Poor, and Bounty upon all charitable Occaſions, gained to themſelves an affectionate Eſteem thro' all that Part of the Country, ſuch as no Prejudice ariſing from a Difference in Religion could or ought to impair; for great and good Actions command our Reſpect, whatever the Opinions of the Donors may be.</p>
            <p>From hence we croſſed the Country to the great Foreſt, called <hi>Epping Foreſt,</hi> reaching almoſt to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The Country on that Side of <hi>Eſſex</hi> is called the <hi>Roodings,</hi> I ſuppoſe becauſe there are no leſs than ten Towns almoſt together, called by the Name of <hi>Roding</hi>; and is famous for good Land, good Malt, and dirty Roads; the latter being in the Winter hardly paſſable for Horſe or Man. In the Midſt of this we ſee <hi>Chipping Onger, Hatfield Broad-Oak, Epping,</hi> and many Foreſt-towns, famed alſo for Huſbandry, and good Malt. On the South-ſide of the County is <hi>Waltham-abbey,</hi> which was formerly a Monaſtery, built by <hi>Harold</hi> Son to Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> in Honour of the Croſs. The Town is ſaid to be built and peopled by one <hi>Tovius</hi> towards the Latter-end of the <hi>Saxons</hi> Reign. This Town is ſeated on the River <hi>Lee,</hi> where the Streams, being divided, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe ſeveral ſmall Iſlands, which in times of great Floods are commonly overflowed: but theſe Meadows
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0141100401:121"/>
produce great Plenty of Graſs in Summer, ſo that here are many Dairy Farms which turn to good Account.</p>
            <p>The Abbey is turned into a Seat, which is now in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>---- Jones,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> The Gardens belonging to this Houſe, were, ſome Years ſince, in great Repute; but ſince the Taſte for incloſed Gardens has been condemned, they have been little frequented, unleſs by ſome curious Perſons, to ſee the <hi>Tulip-tree,</hi> which grows on a Graſs-plat near the Houſe, and is one of the fineſt and moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kind in <hi>England,</hi> producing annually a great Quantity of Flowers in the Month of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this Abbey was bury'd the Body of King <hi>Harold,</hi> ſlain in the great Battle in <hi>Suſſex</hi> againſt <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> whoſe Mother begged that Favour of <hi>the Conqueror</hi>; but no Monument was built for him, only a flat Grave-ſtone, on which was ſignificantly engraven, <hi>Harold Infelix!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I came again over the Lower or Weſtern Part of the Foreſt, where it is beſpangled with Villages, filled with fine Seats, moſt of them built by Citizens of <hi>London</hi>; but the Luſtre of them ſeems to be intirely eclipſed by the magnificent Palace of Earl <hi>Tilney,</hi> which I barely mentioned, (<hi>Pag.</hi> 3.) and intimated that I would touch upon it again; as I ſhall now briefly do. This noble Seat was prepared by his Lordſhip's Father Sir <hi>Joſiah Child,</hi> in his Life-time, who added to the Advantage of its Situation a vaſt Number of Rows of Trees, planted in curious Order for Avenues and Viſta's, all leading up to the Spot of Ground where the old Houſe ſtood.</p>
            <p>In the Place adjoining, the preſent Lord, before he was ennobled, and ſome Years before he began the Foundation of his new Houſe, laid out the moſt ſpacious Pieces of fine Ground in Gardens, that are to be ſeen in this Part of <hi>England.</hi> The Green-houſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0141100401:122"/>
is an excellent Building, fit to entertain a Prince; 'tis furniſhed with Stoves, and artificial Places for Heat, from an Apartment which has a Bagnio, and other Conveniencies, which render it both uſeful and pleaſant; and theſe Gardens have been ſo much the Admiration of the Publick, that it has been the general Diverſion of the Citizens to go out to ſee them, till the Crouds grew ſo great, that his Lordſhip was obliged to reſtrain the ſhewing them to particular and ſtated Times.</p>
            <p>The Houſe was built ſince theſe Gardens were finiſhed. It is all of <hi>Portland</hi> Stone in the Front, which gives it a moſt magnificent Effect at a Diſtance; as the Nature of that Stone, except in <hi>London,</hi> where it is tinged with Smoke, is to grow whiter and whiter, the longer it ſtands in the open Air.</p>
            <p>As the Fore-front of the Houſe looks through a long Row of Trees, reaching to the great Road at <hi>Leighton-ſtone</hi>; ſo the Back-front reſpects the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, from which you fall down an eaſy Deſcent, which lands you upon the Terrace, and gives a moſt beautiful Proſpect to the River, which is all formed into Canals and Openings, to anſwer the Views from above; and beyond the River, the Walks and Wilderneſſes go on to ſuch a Diſtance, and in ſuch a Manner, up the Hill, as they before went down, that the Sight is loſt in the Woods adjoining, and it looks all like one continued planted Garden, as far as the Eye can ſee.</p>
            <p>I have not Room in this Letter to ſay half what might be ſaid of this truly noble Palace, nor for a particular Deſcription of the beautiful Houſe and Gardens erected at <hi>Low-Layton,</hi> by the late Sir <hi>Fiſher Tench</hi>; which the Duke <hi>d'Aumont,</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador from <hi>France,</hi> about the Year 1711, ſaid was one of the neateſt Boxes he had ſeen in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and ſo ſhall haſten to conclude this Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0141100401:123"/>From Earl <hi>Tilney</hi>'s Houſe, and the reſt of the fine Dwellings on that Side of the Foreſt, (for there are ſeveral very good Houſes at <hi>Wanſtead,</hi> only that they ſeem, as I have ſaid, all loſt in the Luſtre of his Lordſhip's Palace) I went South, towards the great Road over that Part of the Foreſt called the <hi>Flats:</hi> And by this Turn came neceſſarily on to <hi>Stratford,</hi> where I ſet out.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> SHALL begin my Account of the famous County of <hi>Kent</hi> at <hi>Deptford.</hi> It was antiently called <hi>Weſt-Greenwich,</hi> and is a very large Town, and of late ſo very much improved, that a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome new Church has been built there, dedicated to St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here was built, by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. a Store-houſe, who alſo incorporated certain Officers by the Name of Maſter and Wardens of the <hi>Holy Trinity:</hi> Theſe were to take care of the Building, Keeping and Conducting of the Royal Navy. Their Hall or Houſe was adjoining to the Church: and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the Navy had alſo a convenient Houſe at the Dock for his Reſidence.</p>
            <p>Here is a Foundation belonging to the ſaid Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of <hi>Trinity-houſe,</hi> by whom it was built at different Times, and in two Places, not quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous. The old Part contains 21 Houſes, the new 38, for decayed Pilots or Maſters of Ships,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0141100401:125"/>
or the Widows of ſuch; the Men are allowed 20<hi>s.</hi> the Women 16<hi>s. per</hi> Month.</p>
            <p>But what <hi>Deptford</hi> is moſt noted for, is its noble Dock, where the Royal Navy was uſed to be built and repaired, till it was found more convenient to build the larger Ships at <hi>Woolwich,</hi> as I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its Place: notwithſtanding which, the whole Area of the Yard is now inlarged to more than double what it formerly was: it has a wet Dock of Two Acres, for Ships, and another of an Acre and half, for Maſts; beſides an Inlargement of its Store-houſes, Dwelling-houſes, Launches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuitable to it.</p>
            <p>Near the Dock is a Seat belonging to Sir <hi>John Evelyn,</hi> which is called <hi>Say's-court.</hi> This was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the Family of the <hi>Magmenots,</hi> who were <hi>Normans,</hi> one of whom was Lord Warden of the Ports, and Governor of <hi>Dover-caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Red Houſe</hi> at <hi>Deptford</hi> was a noted Collection of Warehouſes, and Storehouſes for many Sorts of Merchandizes, and particularly Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 5th of <hi>July</hi> 1739, a dreadful Fire broke out there, which conſumed the ſame. The Loſs was incredible; for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials were ſo combuſtible, that nothing could be ſaved, nor could the Flames be extinguiſhed, till they had nothing to prey upon.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Deptford</hi> I proceeded to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> one of the moſt delightful Spots of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The Park, in which is the fine Obſervatory called <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead-houſe,</hi> from the late famous Mathematician of that Name, the Royal Houſe, but more eſpecially the noble Hoſpital, deſerve particular Notice.</p>
            <p>The Ground on which Part of this Hoſpital now ſtands, is the ſame on which was formerly ſituated the Royal Palace of our Kings. Here <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. held his Feaſts with Jouſts and Tournaments; and the Ground, which was called the <hi>Tilt-yard,</hi> is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0141100401:126"/>
the Spot on which the Eaſt Wing of the Hoſpital is built.</p>
            <p>The Park was inlarged, walled about, and planted, by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. ſoon after the Reſtoration; and the Deſign or Plan of a Royal Palace was then laid out, one Wing of which was finiſhed in a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Manner, and makes now the Firſt Wing of the Hoſpital, towards <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Royal Palace now remaining was originally built by <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>the Good,</hi> Brother of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and called by him <hi>Placentia.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. much inlarged it, added to it a ſmall Houſe of <hi>Friers-Mendicant,</hi> and finiſhed a Tower begun by Duke <hi>Humphrey</hi> on the Top of the Hill, where now ſtands the Royal Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory; from which is a moſt pleaſant Proſpect down to the winding River, and the green Meadows. It was completed by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and afterwards much inlarged and beautified by <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> who dwelt in it. Here Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were born, and here died King <hi>Edward</hi> VI.</p>
            <p>The Hoſpital was founded by King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Year 1694, for the Relief of Seamen, their Widows, and Children, and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Navigation. Three Tables are hung up at the Entrance into the Hall, which record the Names of ſeveral generous Benefactors to this noble Charity, amounting in the Whole to the Sum of 58,209<hi>l.</hi> And in the Year 1732, the forfeited Eſtate of the late Earl of <hi>Derwentwater,</hi> (being, by means of the Right Honourable the Lord Viſcount <hi>Gage,</hi> a Peer of <hi>Ireland,</hi> recovered out of the Hands of certain pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons, who had purchaſed the ſame at a Rate vaſtly diſproportioned to the Value) amounting to near 6000<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> was given by Parliament to carry on and complete this Work; which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to proſecute it with Vigour and Succeſs;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0141100401:127"/>
and accordingly they have made a great Progreſs ſince that time in the ſecond Wing, and other Parts of this ſumptuous Edifice.</p>
            <p>The Hall is very noble, and finely painted by the late Sir <hi>James Thornhill.</hi> At the Upper-end of it, in an Alcove, are repreſented the preſent Royal Family, the late Princeſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> King <hi>George</hi> I. King <hi>George</hi> II. and Queen <hi>Caroline,</hi> the Queen Dowager of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Duke, and the five Princeſſes. On the Ceiling, over the Alcove, are her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Denmark.</hi> And on the Ceiling of the Hall, are King <hi>William,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> with ſeveral fine em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematical Figures.</p>
            <p>On a Pedeſtal in the Middle of the Area of the Hoſpital, fronting the <hi>Thames,</hi> is a Statue of his Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> II.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1705, 100 diſabled Seamen were the firſt that were received into this Hoſpital; but the preſent Number was made up in <hi>December</hi> 1737, a complete 1000. To each 100 Penſioners Six Nurſes are allowed, who are to be Seamens Widows, at 10<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and 2<hi>s. per</hi> Week more to thoſe who attend in the Infirmary. Their common Cloathing is Blue, with Braſs Buttons.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Greenwich</hi> is a very handſome new-built Edifice, dedicated to St. <hi>Alphage,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who is ſaid to have been killed by the <hi>Danes</hi> on the Spot where the Church ſtands, <hi>Anno</hi> 1012.</p>
            <p>There are two Free-Schools in this Pariſh, one founded by Sir <hi>William Boreman,</hi> Kt. The other was ſet up by Mr. <hi>John Roan,</hi> who left his Eſtate for Teaching Boys in Reading, Writing, and Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick; allowing 2<hi>l. per Annum</hi> for each Boy's Cloaths: their Number is Twenty.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a handſome College in this Town, which fronts the River, for the Maintenance of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0141100401:128"/>
Twenty poor Men and a Maſter, founded and well endowed by <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him to the Care of the Mercers Company of <hi>London.</hi> A Chapel belongs to this College, where the Earl's Body is laid, which, as well as his Monument, was removed hither a few Years ago, from the Chapel of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle, whereof he was Conſtable.</p>
            <p>This Town may be ſaid to be one of the genteeleſt, as well as pleaſanteſt, in <hi>England</hi>; the Inhabitants are many of them Perſons of Note and Faſhion, who have ſerved abroad in the Fleets or Armies, and here paſs the Remainder of their Days in Eaſe and Delight, having the Pleaſure to reflect upon the Dangers they have gone thro', and the faithful and honourable Parts they have acted on the publick Stage of Life, in their Country's Cauſe.</p>
            <p>A Market was erected in the Year 1737, at this Town, the Direction of which is in the Governors of the Hoſpital; and the Profits which ſhall ariſe from it, are to be carried to the Uſe of that fine Foundation.</p>
            <p>The River of <hi>Thames</hi> is here very broad, and the Chanel deep, and the Water at ſome very high Spring-tides is ſalt; but in ordinary Tides, ſweet and freſh.</p>
            <p>The Country behind <hi>Greenwich</hi> adds to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Place: <hi>Black-heath,</hi> both for Beauty of Situation, and an excellent Air, is not out-done by any Spot of Ground in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near this is a vaſt Hill, uſed as a Butt for Archers, and in great Requeſt among the neighbouring People, till King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's Time; whence it took the Name of <hi>Shooters-hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Black-heath</hi> ſtands the Hoſpital built by Sir <hi>John Morden,</hi> Bart. a <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchant. Several Years before his Death, which happened in 1708, he erected this ſpacious Structure, in form of a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0141100401:129"/>
College, ſolely at his own Charge, in a Field called <hi>Great Stone Field,</hi> not far from his own Habitation, for the Reception of poor, decayed, honeſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, whereof in his Life-time he placed Twelve there. But by reaſon of great Loſſes, they were reduced to Four in the Lady <hi>Morden</hi>'s Time, who was forced to retrench the Expences of the Houſe, becauſe the Share allotted her by the laſt Will of Sir <hi>John,</hi> and ſome Parts of his Eſtate, did not anſwer ſo well as was expected.</p>
            <p>When ſhe died, Sir <hi>John</hi>'s whole Eſtate coming to the College, the Number was again increaſed, and there are at this Time 35 poor Gentlemen in the Houſe; and the Number not being limited, they are to be increaſed as the Eſtate will afford; for the Building was deſigned for, and will conveniently hold 40.</p>
            <p>Seven <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants have the Direction and Viſitation of this Hoſpital, and the Nomination of the Perſons to be admitted into it; and as often as any of theſe Seven die, the Survivors are to chuſe others to fill up that Number.</p>
            <p>Every Treaſurer of this Hoſpital has 40<hi>l. per Annum.</hi> There is alſo a Chaplain, who is to read Prayers twice a Day in the Chapel, and to preach twice every <hi>Sunday.</hi> His Salary at firſt was 30<hi>l.</hi> a Year; but the Lady <hi>Morden</hi> doubled it at her Death. She was in other reſpects a Benefactreſs to the College; and as ſhe put up her Huſband's Statue in a Niche over the Gate of the College, the Truſtees have alſo put up hers in another Niche adjoining to that of her Huſband.</p>
            <p>The Penſion is 20<hi>l. per Annum</hi> each. At firſt they wore Gowns, with the Founder's Badge; which they have not done for ſome Years.</p>
            <p>The Chapel within the College is neatly wain-ſcotted, and hath a coſtly Altar-piece, and it has a Burying-place adjoining, for the Members of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0141100401:130"/>
College. The Founder, according to his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, was buried in a Vault under the Communion-table of this Chapel.</p>
            <p>The Chaplain, the Treaſurer, the Merchants, are all indiſpenſably obliged to be reſident there; and unleſs in caſe of Sickneſs, no other Perſons are to reſide, live, or lodge there; and no Perſon is to be admitted as a Penſioner, who cannot bring a Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate to prove himſelf upwards of 60 Years of Age.</p>
            <p>In a Word, as the Situation of the Place is pleaſant, the Air very good, and the Endowment very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, this may be ſaid to be one of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and elegant Pieces of Charity in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near this College is the noble Houſe, or rather Palace, of Sir <hi>Gregory Page,</hi> Bart. whoſe Father was a Brewer at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> a few Years ago. It is one of the fineſt Seats in <hi>England,</hi> belonging to a private Gentleman; and the Park, Gardens, and Country round it, contribute to make it a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and truly noble Habitation.</p>
            <p>It was begun and intirely raiſed and covered in the Space of Eleven Months, which ſhews how ſoon a large Building may be finiſhed, where Money, the Sinews of Building, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not wanting.</p>
            <p>Over this Heath the famous <hi>Roman Watling-ſtreet</hi> ran, towards <hi>Shooters-hill</hi>; and ſo on to <hi>Rocheſter, Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Dover.</hi> Here are great Numbers of ſmall <hi>Tumuli,</hi> with ſome large and eminent ones, out of which Bones have been dug by the late learned Dr. <hi>Gale,</hi> (who reſided many Years on this Heath) which ſhew that many Perſons of Eminence have been formerly buried here.</p>
            <p>On this Heath the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army lay a great while encamped, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1011; and many Trenches, and other Remains of the Lines of Camps, are ſtill viſible.</p>
            <p>On the other Side of the Heath, North, is <hi>Charl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a well-built pleaſant Village. The Church was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0141100401:131"/>
beautified and repaired by Order of Sir <hi>Edward Newton,</hi> Bart. who was Tutor to King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's Son, Prince <hi>Henry</hi>; and it is one of the fineſt Churches in this County.</p>
            <p>At the Entrance of this Village, fronting <hi>Black-heath,</hi> ſtands the antient Houſe built by Sir <hi>Edward Newton,</hi> who had this Manor granted to him by King <hi>James</hi> I. It is a long Pile of Building in a <hi>Gothick</hi> Taſte, having Four Turrets on the Top: the Court before the Houſe is ſpacious, at the Entrance of which are too large <hi>Gothick</hi> Piers to the Gates, and in a Line on the Out-ſide of the Wall is a long Row of <hi>Cypreſs Trees,</hi> which are ſome of the oldeſt in <hi>England.</hi> On the Back of the Houſe are large Gardens, remaining in the ſame Taſte in which they were formerly laid out; and behind theſe is a ſmall Park, which joins to <hi>Woolwich Common.</hi> This Houſe is now in the Poſſeſſion of the Earl of <hi>Egmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near the Church are two fine Houſes, one of which was built by the late Lord <hi>Romney,</hi> who married a Daughter of Sir <hi>Cloudeſly Shovel</hi>; the other was in the Poſſeſſion of the late Governor <hi>Hunter,</hi> before he went to <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Houſes ſtand on the Edge of the Hill, having their Gardens ſloping down towards the River, which, tho' it renders the Proſpect to the River very delightful in the Heat of Summer, yet as it expoſes their Gardens to the North Winds, their Fruit-trees are generally blighted; and in the Spring, when the Wind uſually blows from the North, and Eaſt, theſe Gardens are ſo much expoſed to them, that it is very few Days, during that Seaſon, that Perſons can walk with any Pleaſure in them.</p>
            <p>It is true, that in theſe Gardens you have a large Reach of the River in View, ſo that every Tide of Flood, a great Number of Ships are generally ſailing by to <hi>London</hi>; as in the Tide of Ebb, many are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0141100401:132"/>
paſſing toward <hi>Graveſend</hi>; which affords a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Sight, as it ſhews the great Trade carried on by the Metropolis: yet as the Country on the other Side of the Water is a dead Flat for a great Number of Miles, and this often covered with Water in Winter, ſo the Winds not only come very cold over this Flat, but alſo bring Fogs, Damps, and a very unwholſome Air with them, which greatly diminiſhes the Pleaſure of theſe Seats.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlton</hi> is noted for the Fair held in its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood on St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s-<hi>day, Octob.</hi> 18. called <hi>Horn-fair</hi>; the Rudeneſs of which, in a civilized, well-governed Nation, may well be ſaid to be unſufferable. The Mob at that Time take all Kinds of Liberties, and the Women are eſpecially impudent that Day; as if it was a Day that juſtified the giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Looſe to all manner of Indecency with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reproach, or without incurring the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which ſuch Behaviour would deſerve at another time.</p>
            <p>And this in a Circumſtance, which (far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be gloried in) ought to be diſcountenanced by the Sex, as fixing the Brand of Incontinence on too many of them, which they have little Reaſon to be proud of.</p>
            <p>A vulgar Tradition gives the following Origin to this diſorderly Fair: It pretends to ſay, that one of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> ſome ſay, King <hi>John,</hi> who had a Palace in this Neighbourhood, at <hi>Eltham,</hi> being a hunting near <hi>Charlton,</hi> then a pitiful Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let only, and ſeparated from his Attendants, entered into a Cottage, and found the Miſtreſs of it alone; and ſhe being handſome, the King took a Liking to her, and having prevailed over her Modeſty, juſt in the critical Moment, her Huſband came in; and vowing to kill them both, the King was forced to diſcover himſelf, and to compound with Gold for his Safety, giving him moreover all the Land from
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0141100401:133"/>
thence as far as the Place now called <hi>Cuckold's Point</hi>; and making him Maſter of the whole Hamlet, eſtabliſhed a Fair in favour of his new Demeſne; and in Memory thereof, Horns, and Wares, and Toys of all Sorts made of Horn, are ſold at this Fair.</p>
            <p>Thro' this Town lies the Road to <hi>Woolwich,</hi> a Town ſituated on the Bank of the River, and wholly taken up by, and in a manner raiſed from, the Yards and Works erected there for the Naval Service. For here, when the Buſineſs of the Royal Navy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> built larger and greater Ships of War than were uſually employed before, new Docks and Launches were erected, and Places prepared for the Building and Repairing Ships of the largeſt Size; becauſe here was a greater Depth of Water, and a freer Chanel, than at <hi>Deptford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Docks, Yards, and all the Buildings belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, are encompaſſed with a high Wall, and are exceeding ſpacious and convenient; and ſo prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly full of all Sorts of Stores of Timber, Plank, Maſts, Pitch, Tar, and other Naval Proviſions, as can hardly be calculated.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Building-yards, here is a large Rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk, where the biggeſt Cables are made for the Men of War; and on the Eaſt, or Lower-part of the Town, is the Gun-yard, commonly called the <hi>Park,</hi> or the <hi>Gun-park</hi>; where is a prodigious Quantity of Cannon of all Sorts for the Ships of War, every Ship's Guns apart; heavy Cannon for Batteries, and Mortars of all Sorts and Sizes; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that, as I was inform'd, here have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times laid up, at one Time, between ſeven and eight Thouſand Pieces of Ordnance, beſides Mortars and Shells almoſt beyond Number.</p>
            <p>Here alſo is the Houſe where the Firemen and Engineers prepare their Fire-works, charge Bombs, Carcaſſes, and Granadoes for the publick Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0141100401:134"/>Here is uſually a Guard-ſhip riding, eſpecially in time of War. The Town of late Years is much inlarged and beautified, ſeveral fine Docks, Rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and capacious Magazines added; and the Royal Foundery for Cannon repaired and improved. The <hi>Thames</hi> is here at high Water near a Mile over, and the Water ſalt upon the Flood; and as the Chanel lies ſtrait Eaſt and Weſt for about three Miles, the Tide runs very ſtrong, and the River is intirely free from Shoals and Sands, and has ſeven or eight Fathom Water; ſo that the biggeſt Ships may ride here with Safety, even at low Water.</p>
            <p>The Pariſh-church of <hi>Woolwich</hi> has been lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built as one of the Fifty new Churches, in a very handſome manner.</p>
            <p>From this Town, till we come to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> the whole Shore is low, and ſpread with Marſhes and unhealthy Grounds, except ſome few Intervals, where the Land bends inward, as at <hi>Erith, Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hythe, North-fleet,</hi> &amp;c. in which Places the Chalk Hills almoſt join the River; and from thence the City of <hi>London,</hi> the adjacent Countries, and even <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> are ſupplied with Lime, or with Chalk to make it.</p>
            <p>From theſe Cliffs on the River-ſide, the Rubbiſh of the Chalk, which they muſt be otherwiſe at the Charge of removing, is bought and fetched away by Lighters and Hoys, and carried to all the Forts and Creeks in the oppoſite County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and even to <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and ſold there to the Farmers to lay upon their Land, which they do in prodigious Quantities; and are glad to give from 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> to 4<hi>s.</hi> a Load for it, according to the Diſtance.</p>
            <p>This is the Practice in all the Creeks and Rivers in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> even to <hi>Malden, Colcheſter,</hi> the <hi>Naſe,</hi> and into <hi>Harwich</hi> Harbour up to <hi>Maningtree,</hi> and <hi>Ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>; as alſo in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> to <hi>Aldborough, Orford, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, Swold,</hi> and as high as <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0141100401:135"/>Thus the barren Soil of <hi>Kent</hi> (for ſuch the chalky Grounds are eſteemed) make the ſtrong clayey Lands of <hi>Eſſex</hi> rich and fruitful; and the Mixture of Earth forms a Compoſition, which out of two barren Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, makes one prolifick Medium.</p>
            <p>Behind theſe marſhy Grounds in <hi>Kent,</hi> at a ſmall Diſtance, lies the Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> on which, or near it, are ſeveral good Towns; for Example, <hi>Eltham,</hi> formerly a Royal Palace, when the Court was kept at <hi>Greenwich</hi>; and Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> who (as before ſaid) was born at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> was often carried to <hi>Eltham</hi> by her Nurſes, to draw in the wholſome Air of that agreeable Place; but at preſent there are few or no Signs of the old Palace to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>It is now however a pleaſant Town, very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely built, full of good Houſes; and many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of rich Citizens inhabit there, who bring a great deal of good Company with them.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Eltham</hi> lies <hi>Cheſilhurſt,</hi> where is the Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place of the Family of the <hi>Walſinghams,</hi> who reſided in this Pariſh for ſeveral Generations.</p>
            <p>In this Pariſh is an antient Seat called <hi>Frog-pool,</hi> or <hi>Fragnall,</hi> which in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. was in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Thomas le Barbur,</hi> who in the 38th Year of the late King's Reign, had a Charter of <hi>Free-Warren</hi> for his Lands here. This Seat is now in the Poſſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Tryon,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Village is famous for the Retirement of the famous Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> who reſided here for ſeveral Years, and here compoſed the greateſt Part of his <hi>Annals of Queen</hi> Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>Near this are ſeveral other Towns and Villages, as <hi>Bexley, Crayford, Wilmington, Foots-cray, North-cray,</hi> &amp;c. which being Places of little Note, I ſhall paſs over with only obſerving, that about theſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages are many Woods, chiefly of <hi>Birch,</hi> from whence
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0141100401:136"/>
the Broom-makers in <hi>Kent-ſtreet, Southwark,</hi> are ſupplied with their Birch, which bring in a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Profit to the Land-owners.</p>
            <p>From this Side of the Country, all pleaſant and gay, we go over <hi>Shooter's-hill,</hi> where the Face of Things ſeems quite altered; for here we have but a chalky Soil, and far from rich; much overgrown with Coppice-wood, which is cut for Faggots and Bavins, and ſent up by Water to <hi>London.</hi> Here they make thoſe Faggots which the Wood-mongers call Oſtrey-wood, and in particular thoſe ſmall light Bavins which are uſed in Taverns in <hi>London</hi> to light their Faggots, and are called in the Taverns a <hi>Bruſh,</hi> and by the Wood-men <hi>Pimps.</hi> 'Tis incredible what vaſt Quantities of theſe uſed to be laid up at <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, Erith,</hi> and <hi>Dartford</hi>; but ſince the Taverns in <hi>London</hi> are come to make Coal-fires in their upper Rooms, that Trade declines; and tho' that Article would ſeem to be trifling in itſelf, 'tis not immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to obſerve what an Alteration it makes in the Value of thoſe Woods in <hi>Kent,</hi> and how many more of them than uſual are yearly grubbed up, and the Land made fit for the Plough.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> 1739, a very good Deſign was begun to be put in Execution on <hi>Shooters-hill,</hi> a Number of Hands being employ'd in cutting a new Road, wide enough for three Carriages to paſs abreaſt on the Eaſtern Deſcent of the Hill, which was formerly ſo narrow that it was impoſſible for a Paſſenger, if way-laid, to eſcape falling into a Ruffian's Hands, and which gave Occaſion to many Robberies being committed here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dartford</hi> is a handſome large Town, having many good Houſes in it, and is finely watered by two or three very good Springs; the River goes thro' the Town, and diſcharges itſelf into the <hi>Thames.</hi> On this River the firſt <hi>Paper-mill</hi> in <hi>England</hi> was built, by Sir <hi>John Spillman,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0141100401:137"/>
who granted him a Patent, with a Salary of 200<hi>l. per Annum</hi> for his Encouragement.</p>
            <p>The firſt Mill alſo for Slitting of Bars of Iron for making of Wire, was on this River.</p>
            <p>There are two Church-yards here, one about the Church, and the other on the Top of the Hill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>North-fleet</hi>; in the latter of which you may look over the Tower of the Church, the Ground riſing ſuddenly ſo very high.</p>
            <p>Here is a very good Market for Corn on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> and an annual Fair on the 22d of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 31. 1737-8, the Powder-mill at <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> blew up, with this remarkable Circumſtance, That tho' all the Servants were about their reſpective Employments, not one of them received any Hurt. And it is further remarkable, that within eight Years, this is the fourth Time that this Mill has been blown up, and no Damage done by the Diſaſter to the Perſons of the People belonging to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Graveſend</hi> lies on the North-ſide of <hi>Kent,</hi> on the River <hi>Thames,</hi> about ſix Miles North-eaſt from <hi>Dartford,</hi> and about the ſame Diſtance from <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> The Town of <hi>Graveſend</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the 10th Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by the Name of the <hi>Port-Reeve,</hi> Jurats and Inhabitants of the Towns of <hi>Graveſend</hi> and <hi>Milton.</hi> As this Place is the moſt frequented Paſſage of taking Boat for <hi>London,</hi> by Perſons who come from <hi>Dover, Rocheſter, &amp;c.</hi> or thro' any Part of <hi>Kent,</hi> from foreign Parts, ſo Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ordered the Mayor, Aldermen, and Companies of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to receive all eminent Strangers and Embaſſadors here, in their Formalities, and ſo to attend them to <hi>London</hi> in their Barges, if they came up by Water: and if they came by Land, they were ordered to meet them on <hi>Black-heath,</hi> on Horſe-back, in their Gowns. So much did that wiſe Queen conſult the Honour and Grandeur of the City!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0141100401:138"/>King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. raiſed here a Platform of Guns, and another at <hi>Milton,</hi> as well as two others over-againſt them on the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Side, for the Security of the River. But ſince the Erection of <hi>Tilbury-fort,</hi> theſe have been demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1380, this Town was burnt by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleys, and the Enemies carried away moſt of the Inhabitants Priſoners.</p>
            <p>Here is a very handſome Charity, given by one Mr. <hi>Henry Pinnock,</hi> in the Year 1624, of 21 Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and a Houſe for a Maſter Weaver to employ the Poor: And a good Eſtate is alſo ſettled for the Repairs.</p>
            <p>In this Town, on the Eaſt-ſide, is ſtill ſtanding the Body of an antient Chapel, which ſeems to have belonged to ſome Religious Houſe, for Places in the Walls of the Vault remain ſtill for Holy Water. A Market is kept here on <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays,</hi> and an annual Fair on the 13th of <hi>October,</hi> which laſts a Week.</p>
            <p>There have been very great Improvements made of the Lands near this Town within a few Years paſt, by turning them into Kitchen-gardens, the Land being freſh for this Purpoſe, as alſo pretty moiſt, and the Town having good Quantity of Dung made in it, with which they manure the Land: it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces very good Garden-ſtuff in great Plenty, wherewith they not only ſupply the Towns for ſeveral Miles round, but alſo ſend great Quantities to the <hi>London</hi> Markets; particularly <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> which is ſo much eſteemed, that the Name of <hi>Graveſend</hi> will bring a better Price than what is brought from any other Place, this having obtained a much greater Reputation than <hi>Batterſea,</hi> which was ſome Years ſince famous for <hi>Aſparagus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Graveſend</hi> is the great Ferry (as they call it) between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Kent.</hi> It is hardly credible what Numbers of People paſs here every Tide, as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0141100401:139"/>
well by Night as by Day, between this Town and <hi>London.</hi> Almoſt all the People of <hi>Eaſt-Kent,</hi> when they go for <hi>London,</hi> go no farther by Land than this Town; and then for 6<hi>d.</hi> in the Tilt-boat, or 1<hi>s.</hi> in a ſmall Boat or Wherry, are carried to <hi>London</hi> by Water.</p>
            <p>Another Thing for which this Town is worth notice, is, that all the Ships which go to Sea from <hi>London,</hi> take, as we ſay, their Departure from hence; for here all outward-bound Ships muſt ſtop, come to an Anchor, and ſuffer what they call a ſecond Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>(viz.)</hi> here a Searcher of the Cuſtoms comes on board, looks over all the Coquets or Entries of the Cargo, and may, if he pleaſes, romage the whole Lading, to ſee if there are any more Goods than are entered; which however they ſeldom do, tho' they forget not to take a Compliment for their Civility, and beſides being well treated on board, have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Three or Five Guns fired in Honour to them, when they go off.</p>
            <p>The Method of cauſing all Ships to ſtop here is worth obſerving, and is as follows:</p>
            <p>When a Merchant-ſhip comes down from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> (if they have the Tide of Ebb under Foot, or a freſh Gale of Wind from the Weſt, ſo that they have what they call Freſh-way, and the Ships come down apace) they generally hand ſome of their Sails, haul up a Fore-ſail or Main-ſail, or lower the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top-ſail, ſo to ſlacken her Way, as ſoon as they come to the <hi>Old Man's Head</hi>; when they open the Reach, which they call <hi>Graveſend</hi> Reach, which begins about a Mile and half above the Town, they do the like, to ſignify that they intend to bring to, as the Sailors call it, and come to an Anchor.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they come among the Ships that are in the Road, (as there are always a great many) the Centinel at the Block-houſe on <hi>Graveſend</hi> Side fires his Muſket, which is to tell the Pilot he muſt <hi>bring</hi> 
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0141100401:140"/>
               <hi>to</hi>; if he comes on, as ſoon as the Ship paſſes Broad-ſide with the Block-houſe, the Centinel fires again, which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Why don't you bring to?</hi> If he drives a little farther, he fires a third time, and the Language of that is, <hi>Bring to immediately, and let go your Anchor, or we will make you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Ship continues to drive down, and does not let go her Anchor, the Gunner of the Fort is call'd; and he fires a Piece of Cannon, tho' without Ball; and that is ſtill a Threat, tho' with ſome Patience, and is to ſay, <hi>Will you come to an Anchor, or will you not?</hi> If he ſtill ventures to go on, by which he gives them to underſtand he intends to run for it, then the Gunner fires again, and with a Shot; and that Shot is a Signal to the Fortreſs over the River, <hi>viz. Tilbury Fort,</hi> (which I deſcrib'd in my Account of <hi>Eſſex, p.</hi> 5.) and they immediately let fly at the Ship from the Guns on the Eaſt Baſtion, and after from all the Guns they can bring to bear upon her: It is very ſeldom that a Ship will venture their Shot, becauſe they can reach her all the Way to the <hi>Hope,</hi> and round the <hi>Hope-Point</hi> almoſt to <hi>Hole-Haven</hi>; tho' 'tis ſaid, this has been done once or twice: but the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion muſt be very extraordinary to make a Ship run the Riſque. As for Ships coming in, they all go by here without any Notice taken of them, unleſs it be to put Waiters on board, if they are not ſupply'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>On the 24th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1727, a dreadful Fire happen'd here, which burnt down and deſtroyed the Church, and the greateſt Part of the Town; and in 1731, an Act of Parliament paſſed for rebuilding the Church, as one of the Fifty new ones; and the Town too, being moſtly rebuilt, makes a better Appearance for the Calamity it underwent.</p>
            <p>The Paſſage to and from <hi>Graveſend</hi> to <hi>London</hi> is now made more commodious and ſafe for Paſſengers than before, by Act of Parliament paſſed in 1736-7,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0141100401:141"/>
for regulating the Company of Watermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Graveſend</hi> and <hi>Windſor</hi>; which limits the Number of Paſſengers to Forty at the moſt, on board the Tilt-boats, and Ten at moſt by the Wherries; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the Burden of the ſaid Boats; prohibits cloſe Decks and Bails nailed down in the Wherries; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Times of Departure of the Tilt-boats and Wherries, and the Age of the Watermen navigating the ſaid Boats, and directs a Puniſhment againſt ſuch Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen as wilfully loſe their Tide, or ſet the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on Shore two Miles ſhort of the Place to which they are bound. And the Rulers of the Watermens Company are thereby obliged to provide Officers at <hi>Billinſgate,</hi> and at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> who, as near as is poſſible, Night and Day, at every Time of High-Water, and firſt of Flood, are, at the reſpective Places, to ring publickly a Bell ſet up for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for Fifteen Minutes, to give Notice to the Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats and Wherries to put off, and make the beſt of their Way, without lying by, or putting on Shore, being within two Miles of their reſpective Ports. Which excellent Proviſions muſt be a great Eaſe and Safety to all Perſons who are obliged to uſe this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
            <p>A remarkable Occurrence happening the laſt Time I was at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> deſerves to be mentioned here in Honour to a brave and excellent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mariner. The Caſe was thus:</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday, December</hi> 16. 1738, the Ship <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> Captain <hi>Ogilvie,</hi> Commander, outward-bound for <hi>Africa,</hi> lying at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> was, by the boiling over of a Kettle of Pitch, ſet on Fire: to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh which, the Crew at firſt made an Attempt; but finding the Flames increaſe upon them, they were all upon the Point of leaving her, for Fear of 100 Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Gunpowder which were on board: when hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the Mate, returning from a Viſit he had been making to a Brother Officer of a neighbouring Ship,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0141100401:142"/>
ſtopp'd their Deſign, and with a noble Reſolution, cutting the Boats clear of the Ship, told them they had no Means left to eſcape periſhing, either by Fire or Water, but by heartily joining their Endeavours to extinguiſh the Flames. When they found themſelves in ſo bad a Dilemma, they unanimouſly attempted it, and after ſome time providentially got it under, to the no ſmall Joy of the Town of <hi>Graveſend,</hi> as well as of all the Ships near them, who were in the utmoſt Conſternation for Fear of the Gunpowder, and every Moment in Expectation of the terrible Blow.</p>
            <p>We ſee nothing remarkable on the Road hereabouts but <hi>Gad</hi>'s-<hi>Hill,</hi> a noted Place for robbing of Seamen, after they have received their Pay at <hi>Chatham.</hi> Here it was that a famous Robbery was committed in or about the Year 1676, which deſerves to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: It was about Four o'Clock in the Morning, when a Gentleman was robb'd by one <hi>Nicks</hi> on a Bay Mare, juſt on the Declivity of the Hill, on the Weſt Side. <hi>Nicks</hi> came away to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and, as he ſaid, was ſtopp'd by the Difficulty of getting the Boat, near an Hour, which was a great Diſcouragement to him; but he made the beſt Uſe of it, as a kind of Bait to his Horſe: from thence he rode croſs the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to <hi>Chelmsford:</hi> here he ſtopp'd about half an Hour to refreſh his Horſe, and gave him ſome Balls; from thence to <hi>Braintree, Bocking, Wethersfield</hi>; then over the Downs to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and from thence, keeping ſtill the croſs Roads, he went by <hi>Fenny Stratford</hi> to <hi>Godmancheſter</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> where he baited himſelf and his Mare about an Hour; and, as he ſaid himſelf, ſlept about half an Hour; then hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the North Road, and keeping a full Gallop moſt of the Way, he came to <hi>York</hi> the ſame After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; put off his Boots and riding Cloaths, and went dreſs'd as if he had been an Inhabitant of the Place, to the Bowling-green, where, among other Gentlemen, was the Lord-Mayor of the City. He, ſingling out
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0141100401:143"/>
his Lordſhip, ſtudied to do ſomething particular, that the Mayor might remember him by; and then takes Occaſion to aſk his Lordſhip what o'Clock it was, who pulling out his Watch, told him the Hour, which was a Quarter before, or a Quarter after Eight at Night.</p>
            <p>Upon a Proſecution for this Robbery, the whole Merit of the Caſe turn'd upon this ſingle Point; the Perſon robb'd ſwore to the Man, to the Place, and to the Time, in which the Fact was committed; but <hi>Nicks,</hi> proving by the Lord-Mayor, that he was as far off as <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> at that Time, the Jury acquitted him on a bare Suppoſition, that it was impoſſible the Man could be at two Places ſo remote, on one and the ſame Day.</p>
            <p>On the Road from <hi>Gad</hi>'s-<hi>Hill</hi> to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> are very large Cherry-Orchards, eſpecially on the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of the Road: theſe Cherries are ſent up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in Hoys, and were formerly a great Branch of Trade to the Land-owners of this Country; but of late Years there has been ſuch Plenty of this Fruit, that they have ſcarce paid for gathering and ſending to <hi>London,</hi> which has occaſioned many of the Owners of theſe Orchards to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Gad</hi>'s-<hi>Hill</hi> we come to <hi>Rocheſter-Bridge,</hi> the longeſt, higheſt, and the ſtrongeſt built of all the Bridges in <hi>England,</hi> except that of <hi>London.</hi> Some indeed ſay, the Bridge of <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tyne</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all the Bridges in <hi>England</hi> for Strength; but then it is neither ſo high, nor ſo long, as this at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter.</hi> It is ſupported by eleven Arches, and was built by Sir <hi>Robert Knowles</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and railed in with Iron at the Charge of Archbiſhop <hi>Warham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The River <hi>Medway,</hi> at this Place, is very broad and rapid, foaming moſt violently. <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was the <hi>Roman</hi> City <hi>Durobrivis,</hi> and was very ſtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wall'd about and ditch'd. Many Antiquities have
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0141100401:144"/>
been found hereabouts. This City ſtands in an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the River, and ſeems to have been of a ſquare Form, the <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> running directly thro' it. Moſt of the Walls ſtill remain; and a large Piece of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wall, made of Rubble-ſtone laid ſloping ſide-ways, is to be ſeen near that Angle below the Bridge, encompaſſed by the River with <hi>Roman</hi> Bricks in ſeveral Places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rocheſter, Stroud,</hi> and <hi>Chatham,</hi> are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Places, but in a manner contiguous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rocheſter</hi> has ſuffer'd very much by Fire and War. It conſiſts chiefly of a large ill-built broad Street. <hi>Stroud</hi> is ſeparated from it only by a Bridge, and may alone paſs for a ſmall City, and is well-built, but has nothing very remarkable in it.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was erected by King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> I. out of one Angle of the River. The Walls of the great Tower now left, are four Yards thick. The Body of the Cathedral is of the original Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture before the Conqueſt, and repair'd by Biſhop <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulph,</hi> an Architect, who likewiſe built the Caſtle. The great Tower is call'd <hi>Gundulph</hi>'s <hi>Tower.</hi> The chalky Cliff under the Caſtle Wall, next the River, is a romantick Sight. The Rapidity of the Stream waſtes it away, and then huge Tracts of the Wall fall down. On the North Side of the North-weſt Tower of the Church is <hi>Gundulph</hi>'s Effigies. The Front of the Church is of the old Work, but a new Window put in the Middle. The Eaſtern Gate of the City was pull'd down not very long ago, the Stones of which were of a <hi>Roman</hi> Cut. The Town-houſe and Charity-ſchool are two of the beſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Buildings in <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Stroud,</hi> except the Churches.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Chatham</hi> being the chief Arſenal of the Royal Navy of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> is the moſt conſiderable of the Kind in the World. The private Buildings, as the Houſes of the Sea-Officers, Directors, Inſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0141100401:145"/>
and Workmen belonging to the Royal Navy, are well-built, and many of them ſtately. But the publick Edifices there are indeed, like the Ships themſelves, ſurpriſingly large, and in their ſeveral Kinds beautiful. The Ware-houſes, or rather Streets of Ware-houſes, and Store-houſes for laying up the Naval Treaſure, are the largeſt in Dimenſion, and the moſt in Number, that are any-where to be ſeen in the World. The Rope-walks for making Cables, and the Forges for Anchors and other Iron-work, bear a Proportion to the reſt; as alſo the Wet-dock, Canals, and Ditches, for keeping Maſts and Yards of the greateſt Size, where they lie ſunk in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to preſerve them: The Boat-yard, Rope-yards, the Anchor-yard, Forges, Founderies, all not eaſy to be deſcribed.</p>
            <p>We come next to the Stores themſelves, for which all this Proviſion is made; and firſt, to begin with the Ships that are laid up there: The Sails, the Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, the Ammunition, Guns, great and ſmall Shot, ſmall Arms, Swords, Cutlaſſes, Half-pikes, with all the other Furniture belonging to the Ships that ride at their Moorings in the River <hi>Medway,</hi> Powder excepted, which is generally carried to particular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, to avoid Diſaſter, all theſe Stores are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in ſeparate Buildings and Store-houſes appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated for the Furniture of every Ship, and may be taken out on the moſt emergent Occaſion, without Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, are Ware-houſes for laying up the Furniture, and Stores for Ships in general, and for the furniſhing other Ships to be built, or for repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſupplying the Ships already there, as Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may require.</p>
            <p>For this Purpoſe there are ſeparate and reſpective Magazines of Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, Tow, Reſin, Oil, Tallow; alſo of Sail-cloth, Canvas, Cables, ſtanding and running Rigging, ready fitted, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0141100401:146"/>
not fitted; with all Kinds of Ship-chandlery Neceſſaries, ſuch as Blocks, Tackles, Runners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the Cooks, Boatſwains, and Gunners Stores, and alſo Anchors of all Sizes, Grapnells, Chains, Bolts, and Spikes, wrought and unwrought Iron, Caſt-Iron Work, ſuch as Pots, Caldrons, Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo Boats, ſpare Maſts and Yards, with a great Quantity of Lead and Nails, and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, too many to be enumerated.</p>
            <p>To obſerve theſe Things deliberately, one would almoſt wonder what Ships they were, and where they ſhould be found, which could either for Building or Repairing, Fitting or Refitting, call for ſuch a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of all theſe Things; but when, on the other hand, one ſees the Ships, and conſiders their Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and conſequently the Dimenſions of all Things which belong to them; how large, how ſtrong every thing muſt be; how much of the Materials muſt go to the making every thing proportionable to the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the Wonder would change its Proſpect, and one would be as much amazed to think how and where they ſhould be ſupply'd.</p>
            <p>The particular Government of theſe Yards is very remarkable, the Commiſſioners, Clerks, Accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within Doors; the Store-keepers, Yard-keepers, Dock-keepers, Watchmen, and all other Officers without Doors, with the Subordination of all Officers one to another reſpectively, as their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Offices require. The Watchmen are ſet duly every Night at ſtated and certain Places within the ſeveral Yards, with every one a Bell over his Head, which they ring or toll every Hour, giving ſo many Strokes as the Hour reckons; and then one taking it from another through every Part of the Yard, and of all the Yards, makes the Watch be perform'd in a very exact and regular manner. In the River is a Guard-boat, which, like the Main-guard in a Gariſon, rows the Grand Rounds at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0141100401:147"/>
Times, by every Ship in the River, to ſee that the People on board are at their Poſt: If the Man placed to look out in each Ship, does not call, <hi>Who comes there?</hi> the Guard-boat boards it immediately, to examine into the Defect of Duty.</p>
            <p>The Expedition that has been ſometimes uſed here in fitting out Men of War, is ſcarce credible; for the Workmen told us, That the <hi>Royal Sovereign,</hi> a Firſt Rate of 106 Guns, was riding at her Moorings, intirely unrigg'd, and nothing but her three Maſts ſtanding, as is uſual when a Ship is laid up; and that ſhe was completely rigg'd, all her Maſts up, her Yards put to, her Sails bent, Anchors and Cables on board, and the Ship ſailed down to <hi>Black-Stakes</hi> in Three Days, Sir <hi>Cloudeſly Shovell</hi> being then her Captain.</p>
            <p>I do not vouch the Thing; but when I conſider, firſt, that every thing lay ready in her Store-houſes, and wanted nothing but to be brought out and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on Board; a Thouſand or Fifteen hundred Men to be employ'd in it, and more, if they were wanted; and every Man knowing his Buſineſs perfectly well; Boats, Carriages, Pullies, Tackles, Cranes, and Hulk all ready; I do not know but it might be done in one Day, if it was tried. Certain it is, the Dexterity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sailors in thoſe things is not to be matched by any in the World.</p>
            <p>The Building-yards, Docks, Timber-yard, Deal-yard, Maſt-yard, Gun-yard, Rope-walks, and all the other Yards and Places ſet apart for the Works belonging to the Navy, are like a well-order'd City; and tho' you ſee the whole Place, as it were, in the utmoſt Hurry, yet you ſee no Confuſion; every Man knows his own Buſineſs; the Maſter-builders appoint the Working or Converting, as they call it, of every Piece of Timber, and give to the other Head-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Foremen, their Moulds for the ſquaring and cutting out of every Piece, and placing it in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Byrth (ſo they call it) in the Ship that is in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0141100401:148"/>
Building; and every Hand is buſy in purſuing thoſe Directions, and ſo in all the other Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rocheſter</hi> has a Market on <hi>Fridays,</hi> and it hath, by Grant from King <hi>Henry</hi> I. two annual Fairs, <hi>viz. May</hi> the 19th, and <hi>Nov.</hi> the 30th. The Ground on that Side of the Town next the River is very low and marſhy, being overflowed by every high Tide, which renders the Situation unpleaſant, and the Air unwholſome, from the Vapours which ariſe from theſe ſalt Marſhes.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs in this Place to take Notice, that there is in the River <hi>Medway,</hi> at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and in ſeveral of its Creeks and Branches within the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the City, an Oyſter-Fiſhery, which is free to every one who has ſerved Seven Years Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip to any Fiſherman or Dredger, who is free of the ſaid Fiſhery; and the Mayor and Citizens of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> hold a Court, commonly call'd <hi>An Admiralty-Court,</hi> once a Year, or oftener, when Occaſions have required it, for the regulating of the ſaid Fiſhery, and to prevent Abuſes committed in it. In theſe Courts they appoint, from Time to Time, when Oyſters ſhall and ſhall not be dredged and taken, which they call <hi>Opening and Shutting the Grounds</hi>; after the Quantity each Dredgerman ſhall take in a Day, which is uſually called <hi>Setting the Stint.</hi> They have a Power to go on board, and enforce theſe Orders; and when they have found them not duly obſerved, or that the <hi>Brood</hi> or <hi>Spat</hi> has been taken which ſhould have been preſerved, they ſeize and throw into the River and Creeks the <hi>Brood,</hi> or ſuch Oyſters as have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the preſcribed Quantity.</p>
            <p>Perſons who dredge or fiſh for Oyſters, not being Free of the Fiſhery, are called <hi>Cable-hangers,</hi> and are preſented and puniſhed by the Court.

the Authority of this Court, and great Inconveniences ariſing from it, to the endangering the Fiſhery, and to the Deſtruction of all good Order and Rule, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration and Free Dredgermen apply'd to Parliament, and an Act paſſed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1729, eſtabliſhing the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the City of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and enforcing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſaid Courts; and ſince that another Act explaining and ſupplying Defects; ſo that at preſent this Fiſhery is in a flouriſhing Condition, and all the fair Dealers in this Commodity find their Account in it.</p>
            <p>It is about ſixteen or eighteen Miles from <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Bridge to <hi>Sheerneſs</hi> Fort by Water, on the River <hi>Medway</hi>; of this it is about fourteen Miles to <hi>Black-ſtakes</hi>; the Chanel is ſo deep all the Way, the Banks ſo ſoft, and the Reaches of the River ſo ſhort, that, in a Word, 'tis the ſafeſt and beſt Harbour in the World; and we ſaw two Ships of eighty Guns, each riding afloat at Low-water, within Muſquet-ſhot of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Bridge. The Ships ride as in a Mill-pond, or a Wet-dock, except that being moored at the Chains, they ſwing up and down with the Tide; but as there is Room enough, they are moored in ſuch manner, that they cannot ſwing foul of one another; nor did I ever hear of any Accident that befel any of the King's Ships here by Storms and Weather, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in that dreadful Tempeſt in 1703, when the <hi>Royal Catharine</hi> was driven on Shore, and, receiving ſome Damage, ſunk; and the Ship alſo being old, could not be weigh'd again.</p>
            <p>There are Two Caſtles on the Shore of this River, the one at <hi>Upnor,</hi> where is a good Platform of Guns, and which guards Two Reaches of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and is ſuppoſed to defend all the Ships which ride above, between that and the Bridge; alſo on the other Shore is <hi>Gillingham</hi> Caſtle, form'd for the ſame Purpoſe, and well furniſh'd with Guns which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the River; beſides which there is a Fort or Platform of Guns at a Place call'd <hi>The Swamp,</hi> and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0141100401:150"/>
another at <hi>Cockham</hi> Wood. But theſe are principally added ſince the Time that the <hi>Dutch</hi> made that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Attempt upon the Royal Navy in this River on the 22d of <hi>June,</hi> in the Year 1667; for at that Time all was left unguarded, and there were but Four Guns that could be uſed at <hi>Upnor,</hi> and ſcarce ſo many at <hi>Gillingham,</hi> the Carriages being rotten and broken; and, in a Word, every thing concurring to invite the Enemy. There were about Twelve Guns at the Iſle of <hi>Shepey,</hi> where now <hi>Sheerneſs</hi> Fort is built; but the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſoon diſmounted moſt of them; after which they went boldly up to <hi>Black-ſtakes</hi> with their whole Squadron; and after that Seven of their biggeſt Men of War went up as high as <hi>Upnor,</hi> where they did what Miſchief they could, and went away again, carrying off the <hi>Royal Charles,</hi> a Firſt-rate Ship of 100 Guns, and burning the <hi>London,</hi> and ſeveral others, beſides damaging moſt of the Ships that were within their Reach; and, all things conſider'd, it was a Wonder, that they went away without ruining all the reſt of the Navy that was in that River.</p>
            <p>This Alarm gave <hi>England</hi> ſuch a Senſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the River <hi>Medway,</hi> and of the Docks, and Yards at <hi>Chatham,</hi> and of the Danger the Royal Navy lay expoſed to there, that all theſe Doors, which were open then, are lock'd up and ſufficiently barr'd ſince; and 'tis not now in the Power of any Nation, unleſs they were Maſters at Land as well as Sea, to give us ſuch another Affront; for beſides all theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Lines of Guns, and Platforms on each Side the River <hi>Medway,</hi> as we go up, there is now a Royal Fort built at the Point of the Iſle of <hi>Shepey,</hi> call'd <hi>Sheerneſs,</hi> which guards that Entrance into the River. This is a regular Fortification, and has ſuch a Line of heavy Cannon commanding the Mouth of the River, that no Fleet of Men of War could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to paſs by, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> did, without hazarding being torn to pieces. I took a View, while I was in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0141100401:151"/>
theſe Parts, of <hi>Cobham-hall,</hi> ſix Miles from <hi>Chatham,</hi> the Seat of the Earl of <hi>Darnley,</hi> a handſome Brick-houſe, remarkable for the excellent Marble Chimney-pieces in moſt of the Rooms.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Raynham</hi> Church near <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> we ſaw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Monuments of the Family of the Earl of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>; and the Steeple is reckoned a Sea-mark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SHEERNESS</hi> is not only a Fortreſs, but a good Town with ſeveral Streets in it, and Inhabitants of ſeveral Sorts, but chiefly ſuch whoſe Buſineſs obliges them to reſide here. The Officers of the Ordnance have here an Office; they being often obliged to be at this Place many Days together, eſpecially in Time of War, when the Rendezvous of the Fleet is at the <hi>Nore,</hi> to ſee to the furniſhing every Ship with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Stores, as Need requires, and to cheque the Officers of the Ships in their Demands of thoſe Stores, and the like.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo a Yard for building Ships, with a Dock, intended chiefly for repairing Ships that may meet with any ſudden Accident. But then it is to obſerved, that thoſe are generally but for Fifth and Sixth-rate Ships, ſmall Frigates, Yachts, and ſuch Veſſels; tho' once, when I was there, I ſaw one upon the Stocks of Sixty-four Guns. This Yard is a late Thing alſo, and built many Years ſince the Fort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shepey-Iſle</hi> is ſuppoſed to be ſo called from its being one of the firſt Places in <hi>England,</hi> where Sheep were kept, or from its affording a great Plenty of thoſe uſeful Animals. This Iſland is encompaſſed with the mix'd Waters of the <hi>Thames,</hi> and the <hi>Medway</hi> on the Weſt; with the <hi>Swalle</hi> on the South, and with the main Ocean on the North and Eaſt. It hath great Plenty of good Corn, but wants Wood. It is about twenty-one Miles in Compaſs.</p>
            <p>Here are ſeveral <hi>Tumuli</hi> in the marſhy Parts all over the Iſland, ſome of which the Inhabitants call <hi>Coterels</hi>; theſe are ſuppoſed to have been caſt up in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0141100401:152"/>
Memory of ſome of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Leaders, who were buried here; for the <hi>Danes</hi> have often made this Iſland the Scene of their Ravages and Plunder.</p>
            <p>There was antiently a Bridge and Cauſeway, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this <hi>Iſle</hi> and <hi>Harty:</hi> this was called <hi>Threm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bethe-bridge,</hi> as afterwards the Ferry was called <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mod-Ferry:</hi> The common Way into this Iſland, from the main Land of <hi>Kent,</hi> is by <hi>King's-Ferry,</hi> where a long Cable of about a hundred and forty Fathom, being faſtened at each End acroſs the Water, ſerves to get over the Boat by hand.</p>
            <p>On the main Side of the Ferry is a ſmall Stone-building, which will hold Nine or Ten Perſons: this is ſaid to have been erected by one <hi>George Fox,</hi> who ſtaying once there a long while in the Cold, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Ferry-boat, and being much affected with it, he built this Place to ſhelter others from the like Inconvenience. For the Maintenance of this Ferry, and keeping up the Highway leading to it, thro' the Marſhes for above a Mile in length, the Land Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiers tax themſelves one Penny <hi>per</hi> Acre for freſh Marſh-land, and one Penny for every Ten Acres of ſalt Marſh-land <hi>per Ann.</hi> This Tax, together with ſome Lands belonging to the Ferry, has from time to time kept the ſaid Ferry and Cauſeway, with a Wall againſt the Sea, in good Repair; as alſo the <hi>Boats, Cables,</hi> and a Houſe for the Ferry-keeper, who is obliged to tow all Travellers over free, except on four Days yearly, <hi>viz. Palm-monday, Whit-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, St. James's-day</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> when a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pays Two-pence, and a Footman one Penny: But on <hi>Sundays,</hi> or after Eight o'Clock at Night, there is no Paſſage <hi>gratis</hi>; ſo that at ſuch Times, the Ferry-keeper will demand Six-pence of every Horſeman, and Two-pence of every Footman; and in theſe Caſes the Land Occupiers pay as well as Strangers. The Keeper of this Ferry is allowed 24<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> by the Land Occupiers, beſide what he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0141100401:153"/>
makes in carrying over Paſſengers in the Night-time, and on <hi>Sundays:</hi> And to this he has another Perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite added; which is to dredge for Oyſters within the Compaſs of his <hi>Ferry-loop,</hi> which extends one Tow's Length, (as they term it) <hi>i. e.</hi> ſixty Fathoms on each Side of the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>In the upper Grounds of this Iſland, is great Plenty of good Corn; but equal Scarcity of freſh Water, moſt of their Springs being brackiſh; tho' within a few Years paſt, a Well was ſunk ſo deep as to lie below the Bed of the Sea, which has furniſh'd the Gariſon at <hi>Sheerneſs</hi> with freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but before this the People of the Gariſon had a Yacht, which was employ'd in bringing freſh Water from <hi>Deptford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great Number of Marine Plants grow in the ſalt Marſhes, which occaſions the Curious in Botany to viſit this Iſland frequently in the midſt of Summer, when the Plants are in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>At the South-weſt Point of the Iſle of <hi>Shepey,</hi> where the Eaſt <hi>Swale</hi> parts from the Weſt, and paſſes on as above, ſtands <hi>Queenborough</hi>; ſo called by King <hi>Edward</hi> III. in Honour of his Queen <hi>Philippa,</hi> Daughter to <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Hainault</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> Here was a Caſtle erected by King <hi>Edward,</hi> as a Defence of the Mouth of the River <hi>Medway.</hi> In the Building of this Caſtle that Prince was aſſiſted by <hi>William of Wickham,</hi> who was then Surveyor of the King's Works, and afterwards made Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> This Caſtle was afterwards repaired in the Year 1536, by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. who at the ſame time built others at <hi>Deal, Walmer,</hi> &amp;c. for the Defence of the Sea-coaſts. The Governors of <hi>Queen-borough</hi> Caſtle were formerly honoured with the Title of Conſtable; and by the Liſt of them, it appears, that many of them were Men of great Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0141100401:154"/>This Caſtle was ſtanding in the Year 1629; for Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> in his little Book, intituled, <hi>Iter Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum Inveſtigationis ergo ſuſceptum,</hi> tells us, That he ſaw there a noble large Dining-room, or Hall, round the Top of which were placed the Arms of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Kent</hi>; and, in the Middle, thoſe of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with the following <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes under, in great Letters:<q>

            <p>At preſent there are not any Remains of this Caſtle to be ſeen; the Ground where it ſtood is moated round; and there is a Well about 40 Fathom deep, ſtill remaining. By the ſeveral Ordinances which were made by King <hi>Edward</hi> III. relating to Naval Affairs, it appears this Place was then very famous; but at preſent it is a miſerable dirty Fiſhing-town; yet has a Mayor, Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſends Two Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes

to Parliament; altho' the chief Traders of this Town ſeem to be Ale-houſe-keepers, and Oyſter-catchers, and their Votes at an Election for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men are the principal Branch of their ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Traffick. A pernicious Practice! too much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in better Towns, and which may one Day be of fatal Conſequence to the Liberties of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we took Boat, and went up the <hi>Eaſt Swale,</hi> to <hi>Milton,</hi> or <hi>Middleton,</hi> as formerly called, which lies, as it were, hid among the Creeks; for 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of Sight as well by Water as by Land, and yet it is a large Town, has a conſiderable <hi>Saturday</hi> Market, for Corn, Fruit, and other Proviſions; and the Oyſters taken in the Grounds about this Town, are the moſt famous of any in <hi>Kent.</hi> This Town is governed by an Officer, who is called by the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Name <hi>Port-reve</hi>; he is choſen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on St. <hi>James</hi>'s-<hi>day,</hi> and he ſuperviſes the Weights and Meaſures all over the Hundred of <hi>Milton.</hi> It had antiently a Royal Palace for the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>From hence, keeping the Coaſt, and the great Road together, for they are ſtill within View of one another, we come to <hi>Sittingburn,</hi> formerly a Market-town, but ſtill a conſiderable Thorough-fare, and full of good Inns.</p>
            <p>Juſt by the Town are the Ruins of a Fortification raiſed by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> when in Purſuit of the <hi>Danes,</hi> called <hi>Bavord-caſtle.</hi> They boaſt here much, of one <hi>Norwood</hi> having entertained King <hi>Henry</hi> V. on his triumphant Return from <hi>France</hi>; and tho' the Entertainment was, according to the Times, very elegant, yet the whole Expence of it amounted to no more than 9<hi>s.</hi> and 9<hi>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Sittingburn</hi> we came to <hi>Feverſham</hi>; which is a large fair Town, having one long and broad Street: it has a very good Market-houſe, where the Market is kept on <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays</hi>; and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0141100401:156"/>
there are Two annual Fairs in this Town, of Ten Days each; <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>February</hi> the 14th, and on <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 1ſt. This Town is well peopled, and in a very flouriſhing State, being in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of one of the beſt Parts of <hi>Kent,</hi> and having a very commodious Creek to bring in, or carry out their Goods; but many of the Inhabitants have carried on the Smuggling Trade for Years, for which this Creek lies very convenient. <hi>Brandy,</hi> and often <hi>French Wines,</hi> are ſold here at very low Rates, eſpecially at ſuch times as the Smugglers have been apprehenſive of Diſcovery; to prevent which they have been known to ſell their Wines to any Perſons who would venture to purchaſe them, for 2<hi>d. per</hi> Quart.</p>
            <p>The Fiſhermen here have a very good Cuſtom: They will admit no one to take out his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, unleſs he be a married Man. The Trade for Oyſters here with the <hi>Dutch</hi> is ſo large, as to bring in between 2 and 3000<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> ready Money, from <hi>Holland,</hi> for this Commodity only.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Feverſham</hi> are the Remains of a Monaſtery founded by King <hi>Stephen,</hi> where he was buried with his Family. At preſent nothing is left but two Gate-houſes, of mean Structure. At the Diſſolution, they ſay, the Coffin of Lead, which held the Royal Body, was taken up and ſold; but the Corps was thrown into the <hi>Thames,</hi> and taken up by ſome Fiſhermen. Here, in the Year 903, King <hi>Ethelſtan</hi> enacted Laws.</p>
            <p>It was at the Mouth of this <hi>Swale,</hi> namely, at <hi>Shellneſs,</hi> ſo called from the Abundance of Oyſter-ſhells always lying there, that the Smack in which the late King <hi>James</hi> II. embarked for his Eſcape into <hi>France,</hi> ran on Shore, and being boarded by the Fiſhermen, the King was taken Priſoner; and I muſt mention it to the Reproach of the People of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> whatever the Conduct of that unfortunate
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0141100401:157"/>
Prince had been, that the Fiſhermen and Rabble treated him, even after they were told who he was, with the utmoſt Indecency, uſing his Majeſty with ſuch perſonal Indignity, and giving him ſuch oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious and abuſive Language, and ſearching him in ſo rude a manner, that the King himſelf ſaid, <hi>he was never more apprehenſive of loſing his Life than at that Time.</hi> He was afterwards carried by them up to the Town, where he was not much better treated for ſome time, till ſome neighbouring Gentlemen of the County came in, who underſtood their Duty better, by whom he was preſerved from farther Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, till Coaches and a Guard came from <hi>London,</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Order, to conduct him with Safety and Freedom to <hi>London</hi>; where he was much better received.</p>
            <p>While I was near this Town ſome Years before, a terrible Accident happened; namely, the blowing up of a Powder-mill, which ſtood upon the River, cloſe to the Town; the Blaſt ſhatter'd the whole Town, broke the Windows, blew down Chimneys, and Gable-ends; and ſeveral People were killed at the Powder-houſe itſelf, tho' not any, as I remember, in the Town. But what was moſt remarkable in it all, was, that the eldeſt Son of the Maſter of the Powder-mill, a Youth of about Fifteen Years of Age, who was not in the Mill, or near it, when it blew up, but in a Boat upon the River, rowing croſs for his Diverſion, was killed by a Piece of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of the Mill, which were blown up into the Air, and fell down upon him in the Boat.</p>
            <p>After I have mentioned the Tombs of King <hi>Stephen</hi> and his Queen, in <hi>Feverſham,</hi> I know nothing elſe this Town is remarkable for, except the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Smuggling Trade, which I have mentioned, and which is carried on partly by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in their Oyſter-boats; nay, even the Owling Trade, or clandeſtine Exporting of Wool,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0141100401:158"/>
ſeems removed from <hi>Romney Marſh,</hi> to this Coaſt; and a great deal of it has been carried on between the Mouth of the <hi>Eaſt-Swale</hi> and the <hi>North Foreland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this <hi>Eaſt-Swale,</hi> and particularly from theſe laſt Three Towns, <hi>Queenborough, Milton,</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſham,</hi> the Fiſh-market at <hi>Billinſgate</hi> is ſupplied with ſeveral Sorts of Fiſh; but particularly with the beſt and largeſt Oyſters, ſuch as ſome call Stewing, others, <hi>Milton</hi> Oyſters; as they are from the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Side with a ſmaller and greater Sort, called <hi>Wallfleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now croſs the Hills from <hi>Milton</hi> to <hi>Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> on the River <hi>Medway,</hi> near 10 Miles diſtant from <hi>Rocheſter</hi> to the South-eaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maidſtone</hi> is a very antient Town: the River <hi>Medway,</hi> over which it has a Bridge, is navigable up to it by large Hoys, of 50 or 60 Tons Burden, the Tide flowing quite up to the Town. In 1739, an Act paſſed for making it further navigable, of which I ſhall take proper Notice, when I come to ſpeak of the Timber in <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is carried on a Manufacture of Linen-thread, and likewiſe, in the Neighbourhood, are great Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Hops, which were ſuppoſed to be firſt planted here at the Beginning of the Reformation, which gave Occaſion to that old Diſtich,

               <hi>Maidſtone</hi> is eminent for Plenty of Proviſions, for Richneſs of Lands, and for the beſt Market in the County, not excepting either <hi>Rocheſter</hi> or <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> It has alſo a handſome Bridge, which, in the Opinion of ſome, is inferior only in Length to that of <hi>Rocheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Town, and the neighbouring Parts, <hi>London</hi> is ſupplied with more Particulars than from any ſingle Market-town in <hi>England</hi>; which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in purſuance of my firſt Reſolution of obſerving
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0141100401:159"/>
how every Part of <hi>England</hi> furniſhes ſomething to the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. From the <hi>Weald of Kent,</hi> which begins but about Six Miles off, and particularly from that Part which lies this Way, they being the large <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Bullocks.</item>
                  <item>2. From hence are brought great Quantities of the largeſt Timber for Supply of the King's Yards at <hi>Chatham,</hi> and often to <hi>London</hi>; moſt of which is at preſent brought by Land-carriage to <hi>Maidſtone.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. From the Country adjoining, great Quantities of Corn are brought up to <hi>London</hi>; alſo Hops, Apples, and Cherries.</item>
                  <item>4. A Kind of Paving Stone, about Eight or Ten Inches ſquare, exceeding durable, uſed to pave Court-yards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. Fine white Sand for the Glaſs-houſes, eſteemed the beſt in <hi>England</hi> for melting into Flint-glaſs, and Looking-glaſs Plates; and for the Stationers Uſe alſo, vulgarly called Writing-ſand.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>All that Side of the County which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as it is marſhy and unhealthy, by its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the Waters, is chiefly inhabited by Ship-builders, Fiſhermen, Seafaring-men, and Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſuch as depend upon them; and very few Families of Note are found among them. But as ſoon as we come down <hi>Boxley-hill</hi> from <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> or <hi>Hollingbourn-hill</hi> from <hi>Milton,</hi> to the well-watered Plain on the Banks of the <hi>Medway,</hi> we find the Country every-where beſpangled with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Villages, and delicious Seats of the Nobility and Gentry; and eſpecially on the North-ſide of the River, beginning at <hi>Aylesford</hi> on the <hi>Medway,</hi> the Seat of the Earl of that Name, and looking Eaſt towards the Sea, to <hi>Eaſtwell</hi> near <hi>Aſhford,</hi> the Seat of the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among theſe are the antient Families of <hi>Fane, Colepeper, Deerham, Honywood, Wotton, Roberts, Hales,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0141100401:160"/>This genteel Neighbourhood makes <hi>Maidſtone</hi> a very agreeable Place to live in; for here is what is not often found, namely, a Town of very great Buſineſs and Trade, and yet full of Gentry, and good Company.</p>
            <p>There is not much Manufacturing in this County: what is left is chiefly at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and in this Town of <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> and its Neighbourhood. The Manufacture of this Town is principally Linen-thread, as I have ſaid, which they make to pretty good Perfection, tho' not extraordinary fine. At <hi>Cranbrook, Tenterden, Goudhurſt,</hi> and other Villages in the Neighbourhood of this Place, was once a conſiderable Cloathing-trade carried on; and the <hi>Yeomen of Kent,</hi> of whom ſo much has been famed, and who inhabited theſe Parts, were generally much enriched by it; but that Trade is now quite decay'd, and ſcarce Ten Clothiers left in all the County.</p>
            <p>The Farmers, and Deſcendents of theſe Clothiers, upon the Elections of Members for the County, ſhew themſelves ſtill there; for there are ordinarily 14 or 1500 Freeholders brought from this Side of the County, who for the Plainneſs of their Appearance are called the <hi>Grey Coats of Kent</hi>; but are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that whoever they vote for, is ſure to carry it; and therefore the Gentlemen are very careful to preſerve their Intereſt among them.</p>
            <p>This Town of <hi>Maidſtone</hi> is a Peculiar of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who is the proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, and puts in a Curate to officiate for him. The Archbiſhop has a Palace here, which is eſteemed very antient, to which there is a Chapel belonging. The Architecture is <hi>Gothick,</hi> but good of the Kind; and ſome Parts of it have been repaired after the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Manner. <hi>Maidſtone</hi> is a <hi>Roman</hi> Station, named <hi>Vagniacis</hi> or <hi>Madviacis,</hi> from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Maedwaeg</hi> the Meadows on the River <hi>Vaga,</hi> which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0141100401:161"/>
are here beautiful. The Archiepiſcopal Palace was founded by <hi>John Ufford,</hi> and finiſhed by <hi>Simon Iſlep.</hi> The College or Hoſpital was erected by Archbiſhop <hi>Boniface,</hi> and a Chantry by <hi>Thomas Anindel,</hi> now the Free-ſchool. About the Year 1720, ſeveral Canoes were dug up, made of hollowed Trees, in the Marſhes of the River <hi>Medway</hi> above <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> one of which is uſed for a Boat to this Day. In the Hands of Dr. <hi>Dodd</hi> at <hi>Addington,</hi> near <hi>Malling,</hi> in the Year 1720, a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Coin of Amber was found, in the Foundation of a Stone Wall. The convex Side was plain; on the Concave was a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Horſe, rude enough. The Aſſizes are generally held here, and always the County Elections; and it is governed by a Mayor, and Twelve Jurats.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charing,</hi> not far off, was the antient <hi>Durolenum,</hi> ſituated upon a Spring of the River <hi>Len.</hi> Here the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had a caſtellated Palace, given them by ſome of the firſt <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, of which there are large Ruins.</p>
            <p>In my Way to <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> on a former Journey, I ſaw <hi>Mareworth</hi> Caſtle, a pretty Fabrick, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Earl of <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> and on a riſing Ground, within a Mile of <hi>Aylesford,</hi> viewed an Antiquity, vulgarly called <hi>Ketts-cotty-houſe,</hi> which are three great Stones piled on each other, and deemed the Tombs of <hi>Kentigern</hi> and <hi>Horbus,</hi> two <hi>Daniſh</hi> Princes, ſlain in Battle, and there bury'd.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting my Journey from <hi>Maidſtone</hi> to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> I cannot help mentioning <hi>Lenham,</hi> a Town about 17 Miles diſtant from that City; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to which the Rt. Rev. Continuator of <hi>Camden</hi> records the following extraordinary Circumſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"At <hi>Lenham,</hi> ſays he, is a thing exceeding remarkable, mentioned on the Tomb of <hi>Robert Thompſon,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in the Church there, who was Grandchild to that truly religious Matron, <hi>Mary Honeywood,</hi> Wife of <hi>Robert Honeywood,</hi> of <hi>Charing,</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0141100401:162"/>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> She had at her Deceaſe, lawfully deſcended from her, 367 Children; 16 of her own Body; 114 Grandchildren; 228 in the third Generation; and 9 in the fourth.

            </p>
            <p>From hence I purſued my Journey to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which all Writers agree was called, by the <hi>Britons, Kent,</hi> and is the <hi>Duroverno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi>; of which Town, and its Antiquities, ſo much has been ſaid, and ſo accurately, that I need do no more than mention it briefly. However, I obſerve here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the Monk, the firſt Chriſtian Preacher that came from <hi>Rome</hi> into this Iſland, ſettled in this Place: but that he was the firſt that preached Chriſtianity in the Iſland (as ſome have ſuggeſted) is a Miſtake; as the famous Conference between him and the Monks of <hi>Banchor</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> ſufficiently teſtify.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Seven Biſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> including that <hi>Auguſtine</hi>; lie buried here in one Vault.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Thomas à Becket,</hi> Archbiſhop of this See, inſulted the King his Sovereign in an unſufferable Manner; inſomuch that in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> II. he was here murdered by the Connivance, as ſome ſay, of the King; and they ſhew what they call his Blood upon the Pavement at this Day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That they ſhew the Stone-ſteps aſcending to his Shrine, (he being afterwards canonized) worn away to a Slope, by the Knees of the Pilgrims, who viſited it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Bodies of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and of <hi>Edward the Black Prince,</hi> are buried here, and the magnificent Effigies of the latter, very curiouſly carved, lies on his Tomb or Monument. Here is a pretty Chapel, originally deſign'd for the Celebration of Maſſes for the Soul of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0141100401:163"/>6. That the immenſe Wealth offered by Votaries and Pilgrims, for ſeveral Ages, to the Shrine of <hi>Becket,</hi> was ſuch, that the famous <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who ſaw it, ſays of it thus:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"All ſhone, ſparkled, glittered with rare and very large Jewels; and even in the whole Church appeared a Profuſeneſs above that of Kings."</q>
In ſhort, Gold was one of the meaneſt Treaſures of his Shrine: and at the Diſſolution, as <hi>Dugdale</hi> obſerves, the Plate and Jewels filled Two great Cheſts, each whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Eight Men to carry out of the Church. And <hi>Camden</hi> ſays, the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to whom it was dedicated, was almoſt laid aſide for that of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. That all this immenſe Treaſure, with the Lands and Revenues of the whole Monaſtery, were ſeized upon by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. at the general Suppreſſion of Religious Houſes, except ſuch as are annexed to the Deanery and Chapter, and to the Revenue of the Archbiſhoprick, which are not very conſiderable. There is an old Picture of <hi>Becket</hi>'s Martyrdom, and an antient Painting upon the Wall, of the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the Habits of our Anceſtors.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Here are alſo to be ſeen the Monuments of Cardinal <hi>Courticello,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Pole,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Chichley</hi>; Bp. <hi>Peckham</hi>'s, carved in Wood upwards of 450 Years ago; Biſhop <hi>Wharton,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Langton</hi>; with many others of leſs Account.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral is a large and noble Pile of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: very curious Remnants of painted Glaſs are ſtill to be ſeen in the Windows. It is intirely vaulted with Stone, and of a very pretty Model; but much too high for its Breadth, as all <hi>Gothick</hi> Buildings were. The Metropolitan Chair is of grey Marble, ſtanding behind the High Altar. The Cloiſters are pretty good, and near them a very large Chapel, called the <hi>Sermon-houſe,</hi> wainſcotted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0141100401:164"/>
with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Oak. Under it is a large Proteſtant <hi>French</hi> Church, given firſt by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the <hi>Walloons,</hi> who fled hither from the Perſecution of the Duke <hi>d'Alva.</hi> The Number of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees has been ſince very much increaſed by <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants obliged to leave their native Country, thro' the Cruelty of <hi>Louis</hi> XIV.</p>
            <p>The Cloſe where the Houſes of the Prebendaries ſtand, is very ſpacious and fair, and a great many very good Houſes are built in it, and ſome with good Gardens.</p>
            <p>Here are many Remains of <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Buildings. The City is ſtrongly walled about, and many Towers at due Intervals, a deep Ditch cloſe underneath, and a great Rampart of Earth within. The Materials of the Walls are chiefly Flint.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle was built in the Reign of King <hi>William</hi> I. of the ſame Form, and the Walls of the ſame Thickneſs, with that of <hi>Rocheſter. Dungeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> a very high Mount, ſeems to have been Part of the old Caſtle. Oppoſite to it, without the Walls, is an Hill, ſeeming to have been raiſed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> when they beſieged the City. The Top of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon-hill</hi> is equal to the Top of the Caſtle, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits a fine Proſpect over the City and Country.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Monaſtery, two Gates remain next the City, and both very ſtately. Perhaps one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to King <hi>Ethelbert</hi>'s Palace, the other to the Monaſtery, which doubtleſs was very ſplendid; for it covers a great Compaſs of Ground, and is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a very high Wall. There were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Quarrels between the Monks of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and of <hi>Thomas à Becket,</hi> both very rich, and very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious.</p>
            <p>Near this Monaſtery is a vaſt angular Piece of a Tower, (beſides half of another) about 30 Feet high, which has been undermined by digging away a Courſe at Bottom, in order to be thrown down;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0141100401:165"/>
but it happened only to disjoint itſelf from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and lodged itſelf in the Ground in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inclining State. Thus being equally poiſed, it preſents a View of Terror, and forbids a too near Acceſs.</p>
            <p>The adjacent Cloſe is full of religious Ruins, and in a Corner of it are the Walls of a Chapel, ſaid to have been a Chriſtian Temple before <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Time, and reconſecrated by him to St. <hi>Pancras.</hi> Near it is a little Room, ſaid to have been King <hi>Ethelbert</hi>'s Pagan Chapel. The Vulgar ſay, here are the Marks of the Devil's Claws.</p>
            <p>Eaſtward of this, and farther out of the City, is <hi>St. Martin</hi>'s Church, ſaid to be <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s firſt See, and the Place whither King <hi>Ethelbert</hi>'s Queen uſed to repair to divine Service. It is built moſtly of <hi>Roman</hi> Brick. In the Middle is a very large old faſhioned Font, ſuppoſed to be that where the King was baptized.</p>
            <p>North of the City is a very ſmall Remainder of <hi>St. Gregory</hi>'s Chapel, founded probably by <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to the Honour of that Pope, his Patron.</p>
            <p>The City has been much advantaged by the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in it of Two or Three thouſand <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, Men, Women, and Children, owing to the above-mentioned Expulſion of the Proteſtants under <hi>Louis</hi> XIV.</p>
            <p>The Employment of thoſe Refugees was chiefly <hi>Broad Silk Weaving,</hi> which has ſuffered ſeveral Changes and Alterations; but is ſtill carried on here to ſome Account.</p>
            <p>But what has added moſt to the Advantage of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> is the Hop-grounds all round the Place, to the Amount of ſeveral Thouſand Acres, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Canterbury</hi> was, for ſome time, the greateſt Plantation of Hops in the whole Iſland; but now they have a Rival, if not an Over-match, about <hi>Farnham,</hi> as I ſhall obſerve in its Place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0141100401:166"/>In <hi>January</hi> 1738, were found in a Shave belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Eſtate of Sir <hi>John Hales,</hi> who lives in this Neighbourhood, and within his Manor of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall</hi> near <hi>Sittingbourn,</hi> ſeveral Hundreds of broad Pieces of Gold, which were thought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in the Time of the late Civil Wars by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor of Sir <hi>John.</hi> They were found by a poor Boy, who was rambling in the Coppice; and not knowing what to make of them, was playing with ſome of them at a Farmer's in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Farmer got Poſſeſſion of them; but not being able to keep the Secret, he refunded 624 of the Broad-pieces for the Uſe of the Crown: Tho' Sir <hi>John</hi> laid Claim to the Whole.</p>
            <p>The Shore from <hi>Whitſtable,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Swale,</hi> affords nothing remarkable but Sea-marks, and ſmall Towns on the Coaſt, till we came to <hi>Margate,</hi> noted for King <hi>William</hi>'s frequently Landing here in his Returns from <hi>Holland,</hi> and for ſhipping a vaſt Quantity of Corn for <hi>London</hi> Market, moſt, if not all of it, the Product of the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> in which it ſtands. There is lately erected here a Salt-water Bath, which has performed great Cures in nervous and paralytick Caſes, and in Numbneſs of the Limbs; and ſeems every Day to become more and more in Requeſt.</p>
            <p>But it may not be unacceptable to tranſcribe a few Lines from <hi>Camden,</hi> in Honour to the Induſtry of the Inhabitants in this Part of the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> which I recommend to the <hi>Admiration,</hi> for I doubt it would be too much to ſay <hi>Imitation,</hi> of the reſt of <hi>Britain,</hi> both North and South. It is as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Nor muſt I here omit the mention of a Thing very much to the Honour of the Inhabitants of <hi>Thanet,</hi> thoſe eſpecially who live near the Roads or Harbours of <hi>Margate, Ramſgate,</hi> and <hi>Brod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtear</hi>; namely, that they are exceeding induſtrious,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0141100401:167"/>
and are, as it were, <hi>amphibious Creatures,</hi> and get their Living both by Sea and Land: they deal in both Elements, are both Fiſhers and Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, both Huſbandmen and Mariners; and the ſelf-ſame Hand that holds the Plough, ſteers the Ship. According to the ſeveral Seaſons, they make Nets, fiſh for Cod, Herring, Mackarel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> go to Sea themſelves, and export their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. And thoſe very Men alſo dung their Ground, plough, ſow, harrow, reap, inn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quick and active in both Employments; and ſo the Courſe of their Labours runs round. And when there happen any Shipwrecks, as there do here now and then, (for thoſe Shallows and Shelves ſo much dreaded by Seamen lie over-againſt it; namely, the <hi>Godwin,</hi> the <hi>Brakes,</hi> the <hi>Four-foot,</hi> the <hi>Whitdick,</hi> &amp;c.) they are extremely induſtrious to ſave the Lading."</q>
I ſhall only add, That it is highly to the Reputation of thoſe People, if they continue to deſerve this excellent Character; but I have heard of ſome late Inſtances, that are not at all to their Honour in this latter Particular.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Stanar</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> the <hi>Rutupiae</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is to be ſeen the Sepulchre of <hi>Vortimer,</hi> King of the antient <hi>Britons,</hi> who having vanquiſhed the <hi>Saxons</hi> in many Battles, and at laſt driven them out of the Iſland, ordered, before his Death, that he ſhould be buried here, on a fond Conceit that his Corpſe would fright them from landing any more upon this Coaſt. Like the great <hi>Scipio,</hi> who having ſubdued the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> ordered his Tomb to be turned towards <hi>Africa,</hi> to fright them from the Coaſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> But the poor <hi>Britons</hi> ſoon found the Difference between a <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>Grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the North-eaſt Point of this Land, is the Promontory, or Head-land, which I have often
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0141100401:168"/>
mentioned, called the <hi>North-Foreland</hi>; which, by a Line drawn due North to the <hi>Naſe</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> about Six Miles ſhort of <hi>Harwich,</hi> makes the Mouth of the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and the Port of <hi>London.</hi> As ſoon as any Veſſels paſs this <hi>Foreland</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> they are properly ſaid to be in the open Sea; if to the North, they enter the <hi>German</hi> Ocean; if to the South, the Chanel, as 'tis called, that is, the narrow Seas between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; and all the Towns or Harbours before we come this Length, whether on the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> or <hi>Eſſex</hi> Shore, are called Members of the Port of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Point Weſtward, the firſt Town of Note is <hi>Ramſgate,</hi> a ſmall Port; the Inhabitants are mighty fond of having us call it <hi>Romans-gate</hi>; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the <hi>Romans,</hi> under <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> made their firſt Attempt to land here, and that, being driven back by a Storm, he ſoon returned, and coming on Shore with a good Body of Troops, beat back the <hi>Britons,</hi> and fortify'd his Camp, juſt at the Entrance of the Creek, where the Town now ſtands; while others as poſitively aſſert, that that great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander firſt landed at <hi>Deal</hi>; as I ſhall obſerve anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richborough-caſtle</hi> is a Mile diſtant from <hi>Stanar</hi> and <hi>Sandwich.</hi> At the Foot of it runs the River coming from <hi>Canterbury.</hi> This River at firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged itſelf into the Sea by <hi>Ebbesflete,</hi> North of the <hi>Roman</hi> City <hi>Rutupiae,</hi> now <hi>Stanar</hi>; till the Sand pouring ſo directly upon it, obliged the Stream to ſlide under the Cliff by <hi>Richborough-caſtle,</hi> and ſo by <hi>Sandwich.</hi> The Caſtle is a moſt noble Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquity. The Walls on Three Sides are pretty intire, and in ſome Places ſtill about 25 or 30 Feet high, without any Ditch. The Side next the Sea being upon a kind of Cliff, the Top of the Wall is but level with the Ground. Here, in the latter Times of the Empire, the <hi>Legio</hi> II. <hi>Aug.</hi> was quartered. And from the Condition of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0141100401:169"/>
Walls it muſt have been deſtroy'd with great Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, probably by the <hi>Saxons.</hi> In the Way to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> upon an Eminence, is the Remainder of an Amphitheatre made of Turf, probably for the Exerciſe and Diverſion of the Gariſon. Before <hi>Sandwich</hi> Gates are two <hi>Roman Tumuli,</hi> on one of which ſtands a Windmill. And South of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> on the Sea-ſhore, are Six large and broad <hi>Celtic Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli,</hi> at equal Diſtances. This flat Coaſt is fenced againſt the Ocean by the Sand-downs. From <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> as far as <hi>Hythe,</hi> the Coaſt of <hi>France</hi> was viſible all the Way as we rode. The Reverend Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> has publiſhed, within theſe few Years, a curious Hiſtory of the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> to which I ſhall refer for ſeveral Particulars, which deſerve the Attention of a Traveller.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sandwich,</hi> one of the Cinque-ports, lies in the Bottom of a Bay, at the Mouth of the River <hi>Stour,</hi> formerly a Town of great Repute and Trade. It decay'd in the <hi>Saxons</hi> Time, and was utterly ruined by the <hi>Danes.</hi> Being raiſed again, it had the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be reduced to Aſhes in King <hi>John</hi>'s Reign; after which it was rebuilt. But in the Reign of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mouth of its Harbour was ſo choaked up by a Ship of great Burden, which ſunk in it, and gave Opportunity to the Sands and Beach ſo to fill it up, that it was incurable: the Town of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence fell to Decay, and it is now a very poor Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sandwich</hi> is noted for Carrots, which are brought to <hi>London</hi> during the Winter Seaſon; and from hence it is that moſt of the Markets are ſupplied with theſe Roots, which are eſteemed the ſweeteſt, as they are alſo the largeſt which are produced in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or perhaps in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Place alſo the Seedſmen in <hi>London</hi> are furniſhed with the greateſt Quantity of their Seeds: the Land being light, ſandy, and freſh, is very good
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0141100401:170"/>
for producing moſt Sorts of Seeds, and the Ground being pretty low, the Seeds do not ſo often receive a Blight, as in many other Places.</p>
            <p>Not far from hence is <hi>Wingham,</hi> which gives Title of Baron to Earl <hi>Cowper.</hi> From hence I went to <hi>Deal,</hi> called by <hi>Caeſar Dola,</hi> having landed not far from this Place. It is the famous Road for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, ſo well known all over the trading World by the Name of the <hi>Downs,</hi> and where almoſt all Ships which arrive from Foreign Parts for <hi>London,</hi> or go from <hi>London</hi> to Foreign Parts, and paſs the Chanel, generally ſtop; the Homeward-bound, to diſpatch Letters, ſend their Merchants and Owners the good News of their Arrival, and ſet their Paſſengers on Shore; and the Outward-bound, to take in freſh Proviſions, to receive their laſt Orders, Letters, and Farewels from Owners, and Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when the Wind preſents fair, Ships come in here, and paſs thro' at once, without coming to an Anchor; for they are not obliged to ſtop, but for their own Convenience.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Downs</hi> would be a very wild and dangerous Road for Ships, were it not for the <hi>South-Foreland,</hi> a Head of Land forming the Eaſt Point of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Shore; and is called the <hi>South,</hi> as its Situation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>North-Foreland</hi>; and which breaks the Sea off, which would otherwiſe come rolling up from the Weſt, to the Flats or Bank of Sands, which for Three Leagues together, and at about a League, or League and half Diſtance, run parallel with the Shore, and are dry at low Water; ſo that theſe two, breaking all the Force of the Sea, on the Eaſt, South, and South-weſt, make the <hi>Downs</hi> accounted a very good Road.</p>
            <p>And yet on ſome particular Winds, and eſpecially, if they over-blow, the <hi>Downs</hi> proves ſuch a wild Road, that Ships are driven from their Anchors, and often run on Shore, or are forced on the ſaid Sands,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0141100401:171"/>
or into <hi>Sandwich-bay,</hi> or <hi>Ramſgate-pier,</hi> in great Diſtreſs; this is particularly when the Wind blows hard at South-eaſt, or at Eaſt-by-north, or Eaſt-north-eaſt, and ſome other Points; and terrible Havock has been made in the <hi>Downs</hi> at ſuch times.</p>
            <p>But the moſt unhappy Inſtance that can be given of any Diſaſter in the <hi>Downs,</hi> was in the time of that terrible Tempeſt, which we call, by way of Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>The Great Storm,</hi> being on the 27th of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1703: Unhappy in particular, for that there chanced at that time to be a great Part of the Royal Navy come into the <hi>Downs,</hi> in their way to <hi>Chatham,</hi> to be laid up.</p>
            <p>Five of the biggeſt Ships had the good Fortune to puſh thro' the <hi>Downs</hi> the Day before, finding the Wind then blew very hard, and were come to an Anchor at the <hi>Gunfleet</hi>; and had they had but one fair Day more, they had been all ſafe at the <hi>Nore,</hi> or in the River <hi>Medway</hi> at <hi>Black-ſtakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remained in the <hi>Downs</hi> about 12 Sail, when this terrible Tempeſt began, at which time <hi>England</hi> may be ſaid to have received the greateſt Loſs that ever happened to the Royal Navy at one time, either by Weather, by Enemies, or by any Accident whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The ſhort Account of it is as follows:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Northumberland,</hi> a Third Rate, carrying 70 Guns, and 353 Men; the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> a Second Rate, carrying 76 Guns, and 386 Men; the <hi>Sterling Caſtle,</hi> a Second Rate, carrying 80 Guns, and 400 Men, but had only 349 Men on board; and the <hi>Mary,</hi> a Third Rate, of 64 Guns, having 273 Men on board; theſe were all loſt, with all their Men, except one Man out of the <hi>Mary,</hi> and 70 Men out of the <hi>Sterling-Caſtle,</hi> who were taken up by Boats from <hi>Deal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is beſides the Loſs of Merchants Ships, which was exceeding great, not here only, but in almoſt all the Ports in the South and Weſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0141100401:172"/>The Town of <hi>Deal</hi> carries on ſome Foreign Trade, and is very much improved of late Years, to which the great Reſort of Seamen to it from the Ships in the <hi>Downs</hi> has not a little contributed.</p>
            <p>I took a Niew of <hi>Sandown-caſtle, Deal</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-caſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sandown-caſtle</hi> is compoſed of four Lunets of very thick arched Work of Stone, with many Port-holes for great Guns. In the Middle is a great round Tower, with a Ciſtern at-top; and underneath, an arched Cavern Bomb-proof. A Foſs encompaſſes the Whole, to which is a Paſſage over a Draw-bridge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deal-caſtle</hi> and <hi>Walmer-caſtle</hi> are, like the former, all built, as I have ſaid, by K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to guard this Coaſt. Between <hi>Walmer-caſtle</hi> and <hi>Deal</hi> was probably the Spot where <hi>Caeſar</hi> landed in his firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, becauſe it is the firſt Place where the Shore can be aſcended North of <hi>Dover</hi>; and exactly anſwers his aſſigned Diſtance of eight Miles. In his ſecond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, with many more Ships, and upon a perfect Knowledge of the Country, he might land at <hi>Deal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dover</hi> ſtands in a moſt romantick Situation: it is a great Valley, and the only one about this Coaſt, where Water is admitted inwards of the Cliff, which is here very high. The Sea formerly came a good way higher up, and made a large Port. Anchors have been found above the Town. The <hi>Roman</hi> City <hi>Dubris</hi> was to the South of the River. The <hi>Watling ſtreet</hi> enters it as <hi>Bigin-gate,</hi> coming very ſtrait from <hi>Canterbury</hi> over <hi>Barham-down,</hi> where it is very perfect. Some of the Walls are left. The Churches are of a very antique Make: that of <hi>St. Martin</hi> is Collegiate, founded by <hi>Wightred</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and is a venerable Ruin. It was built in Form of a Croſs. Of the Priory, now a Farm-houſe, are large Remains. The Hoſpital over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt it is made a Store-houſe. Here the Knights Hoſpitalers or Templers lodged, as they came into,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0141100401:173"/>
or went out of the Kingdom. The Piers which form the Haven or large Baſon, are coſtly and great Works. Above is a Fort with four Baſtions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Date. The broad Beach, which lies at the Mouth of this great Valley, and was the Harbour in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Time, is very delightful. One long Street here is nam'd <hi>Snaregate,</hi> from the moſt tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Rocks of Chalk, which project directly over the Houſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle is very large, and ſituated upon a Rock rugged and ſteep on every Side; but towards the Sea it riſes to an extraordinary Height. Tho' of late Years neglected, it was once ſo well fortify'd, and of ſuch Importance, as to be accounted the Key of <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> when he had an Eye upon the Kingdom, took an Oath of <hi>Harold,</hi> that he ſhould deliver into his Hands this Caſtle with the Well, which is Sixty Fathoms deep, and ſaid to be the Work of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> In ſhort it was the ſtrongeſt old Fortification in the World; and takes up thirty Acres of Ground.</p>
            <p>In the late War with <hi>France,</hi> 1500 Priſoners were confined in the great Caſtle. The Braſs Gun, call'd <hi>Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s Pocket-Piſtol,</hi> is a great Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, twenty-two Feet long. It is excellently well wrought, requires Fifteen Pounds of Powder, and carries a Ball Seven Miles. Here are Two very old Keys, and a braſs Horn, which ſeem to be the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Authority belonging to the Conſtable of the Caſtle, or Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. One Part of the Fortifications conſiſts of a circular Work, in which ſtands an old Church, ſaid to have been built by <hi>Lucius,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King in <hi>Britain,</hi> out of ſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ruins; for there are huge Quantities of <hi>Roman</hi> Brick laid into the Work; and the Remainder is of Stone, originally cut by the <hi>Romans.</hi> It is in Form of a Croſs, and has a ſquare Tower in the Middle. The Stone Windows are of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0141100401:174"/>
much later Date than the Building: but the greateſt Curioſity is the Pharos or <hi>Roman</hi> Watch-tower, ſtanding at the Weſt-end of the Church. This Building was made uſe of as a Steeple, and had a pleaſant Ring of Bells, which Sir <hi>George Rooke</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd to be carried away to <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> Since when, the Lead which cover'd it, has been taken away by Order of the Officers of Ordnance; ſo that this rare Piece of Architecture is left expoſed to the Sea and Weather. Here was found a Coin of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian.</hi> The <hi>Erpinghams</hi> Arms are patch'd up againſt one Side of the <hi>Pharos</hi>; ſo that it ſeems to have been repair'd in the Days of King <hi>Henry</hi> V. when the Lord <hi>Erpingham</hi> was Warden of <hi>Dover-caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon another Rock over-againſt that on which the Caſtle is ſituated, and almoſt as high, are the Remains of an old Watch-tower, now vulgarly called <hi>Bredenſtone,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Devil's-drop,</hi> from the Strength of the Mortar. Here the new Conſtable of the Caſtle is ſworn. Under this Place King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. built the Mole or Pile called the <hi>Pier,</hi> that Ships might ride therein with great Safety. But tho' it was done with vaſt Labour and Expence, by large Beams faſtened in the Sea, bound together with Iron, and great Piles of Wood and Stone heap'd upon all; yet the Fury of the Sea was ſoon too hard for the Work, and the Timbers beginning to disjoint, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> expended great Sums upon it. And ſeveral Acts have paſſed to repair and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the ſame; which alſo including the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Preſervation of the Harbour of <hi>Rye,</hi> I ſhall take Notice of both, when I mention that of <hi>Rye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dover,</hi> the <hi>Portus Dubris</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is one of the Cinque Ports, and was formerly bound to ſend twenty-one Ships for the Wars. It affords a See to the Suffragan of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> as often as any ſuch is appointed. Moſt of the Buſineſs relating to theſe Ports in general is done,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0141100401:175"/>
and all the Courts kept here. The other Cinque Ports are <hi>Haſtings, Hythe, Romney</hi> and <hi>Sandwich. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> has two Appendages, namely, <hi>Winchelſea</hi> and <hi>Rye,</hi> which, as well as <hi>Haſtings,</hi> are in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and the others in <hi>Kent</hi>; they have all great Privileges: their Burgeſſes are called Barons; who on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronations of our Sovereigns, ſupport the Canopies over their Heads, have a Table at the King's Right Hand, the Canopy for their Fee, and enjoy other Privileges. The Lord Warden of theſe Five Ports is generally one of the firſt Noblemen in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>The Packets for <hi>France</hi> go off here, as alſo thoſe for <hi>Oſtend,</hi> with the Mails for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and all thoſe Ships which carry Freights from <hi>New-York</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> and from <hi>Virginia</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> come gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hither, and unlade their Goods, enter them with the Cuſtom-houſe Officers, pay the Duties, and then enter them again by Certificate, reload them, and draw back the Duty by Debenture, and ſo they go away for <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we paſs from <hi>Dover</hi> to the ſmaller Cinque Ports of <hi>Hythe, Romney,</hi> and <hi>Rye,</hi> we ſee <hi>Folkſtone,</hi> a little Village now, which the Sea has made great Inroads upon; but which formerly made a greater Figure. A copious Spring went thro' the Town. Two Pieces of old Wall, ſeemingly <hi>Roman,</hi> hang frightfully over the Cliff. Here are ſome old Guns, one of Iron of a very odd Caſt, doubtleſs as old as the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. Many <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Coins have alſo been found. And here a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery was built by <hi>Eanſwide,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Eadbald,</hi> King of <hi>Kent.</hi> This Place is now principally of Note for a Multitude of Fiſhing-boats belonging to it, which are one Part of the Year employed in catching Mackarel for the City of <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Folkſtone</hi> Men catch them, and the <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Barking</hi> Mackarel-Smacks, of which I have ſpoken
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0141100401:176"/>
at large in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> come down and buy them, and whiſk away to Market under ſuch a Croud of Sails, that one would wonder they could bear them. About <hi>Michaelmas</hi> theſe <hi>Folkſtone</hi> Barks, among others from <hi>Shoreham, Brighthelmſton</hi> and <hi>Rye,</hi> go away to <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and <hi>Leoſtoff,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and catch Herrings for the Merchants there. It hath been obſerved of ſome Hills in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of <hi>Folkſtone,</hi> as the Right Rev. Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of <hi>Camden</hi> takes Notice, that they have viſibly ſunk and grown lower, within the Memory of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sandgate</hi> Caſtle, ſituated in the Bottom of Two Hills, on the Sea-ſhore, hath about Sixteen Guns to defend the Fiſhing-craft from the Inſults of Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, in Time of War: it hath ſeveral good Houſes about it, and was built by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.</p>
            <p>After we have paſſed this Caſtle, we enter upon the Beach. Here are many Springs, which deſcending from the higher Ground, ſink immediately into this Beach, rendering it a little boggy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hythe,</hi> one of the Cinque Ports, ſtands on the Edge of the leſs Ridge; but the Marſh has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it from the Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hythe</hi> in <hi>Saxon</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Port</hi> or <hi>Station</hi>; but at preſent it hardly anſwers the Name; for the Sands have ſo choaked it up, that the Sea is ſhut out from it to a great Diſtance. This Town, as alſo <hi>Weſt-Hythe,</hi> from which the Sea retir'd above 200 Years ago, owe their Original to <hi>Lemanis,</hi> or <hi>Limne,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Port, of which more anon, now a little Village adjoining, which was formerly a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Port, before it was ſhut up with Sands, thrown in by the Sea, which gave Riſe to the two <hi>Hythes</hi> before-mentioned, which, in their Turns, have met with the ſame Fate. A particular Providence hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at <hi>Hythe, April</hi> 24. 1739. About Eleven o'Clock the Steeple of their Church, in which were
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0141100401:177"/>
Six Bells, fell down. About Ten Perſons were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when it fell, waiting in the Church-porch for the Keys to go up into the Steeple for a View; but ſome Delay being made in bringing them, they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily receiv'd no other Damage than being terribly frightened. In a Vault under the Church we ſaw a vaſt Heap of human Bones, ſome of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Size, ſaid to be gathered up after a bloody Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fought between the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About a Mile diſtant from it is <hi>Saltwood-Caſtle,</hi> a very ſtrong Seat of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The outer Wall has Towers and Battlements, and a deep Ditch. Within, and on one Side, ſtands the main Body of the Palace. There are two great and high Towers at the Gate of this, over which are the Arms of Archbiſhop <hi>Courtney,</hi> the Founder. This inner Work has a ſtronger and higher Wall, with a broad embattled Parapet at top. Within is a Court, but the Lodgings are all demoliſh'd. The Floor of the ruinous Chapel is ſtrongly vaulted. In the Middle of the Court is a large ſquare Well, ſeemingly <hi>Roman.</hi> They ſay that Anchors have been dug up hereabouts, which makes it likely that the <hi>Romans</hi> had here an Iron Forge; and ſome will have it, that the Sea came up formerly to it, and ground this Opinion on theſe Anchors found here.</p>
            <p>A little Way further, at the End of the <hi>Stane-ſtreet,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Road from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> is the Port of <hi>Lemanis</hi> or <hi>Limne</hi> mention'd above. At <hi>Limne</hi> Church, from the Brow of the Hill, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the ruinous <hi>Roman</hi> Walls, ſituate almoſt at the Bottom of the Marſhes. A pretty Brook, which riſes from the Rock, Weſt of the Church, runs for ſome Space on the Eaſt Side of the Wall; then paſſes thro' it, and ſo along its lowermoſt Edge, by the Farm-houſe at Bottom: here Coins have been found. Once the Sea-bank broke, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Ocean into all the adjacent Marſhes.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0141100401:178"/>
The Port is now call'd <hi>Shipway,</hi> where the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports was formerly ſworn, the Courts kept, and all the Pleas relating thereto, till <hi>Dover</hi> ſuperſeded it. The People of <hi>Limne</hi> had a Horn and Mace, the remaining Enſigns of their Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Romney</hi> is a large fine Village, and likewiſe a Cinque Port; it is the chief Town of the Marſh-Grounds, which were antiently part of the Sea, called <hi>Romney Marſh,</hi> and has <hi>Old Romney</hi> and <hi>Lech</hi> for its Members. It is ſeated on a high Hill of Gravel and Sand, and on the Weſt Side of it, had a pretty large Harbour guarded againſt moſt of the Winds, before the Sea retir'd from it. In the Year 1287, when the Town was at its Height, it was divided into Twelve Wards, had Five Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches, a Priory, and an Hoſpital for the Sick. But it has been dwindling till it came to its preſent low Condition, ever ſince the Reign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> I. when an Inundation of the Sea deſtroy'd Men, Cattle and Houſes, threw down a whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Village called <hi>Prom-Hill,</hi> and remov'd the <hi>Rother,</hi> (in <hi>Britiſh</hi> Yz Odz) which uſed to empty itſelf into the Sea at <hi>Romney,</hi> out of its Chanel, ſtopping up its Mouth, and opening it a nearer Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the Sea by <hi>Rye</hi>; leaving here only a little Bay for Fiſhing-boats.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Romney-Marſh</hi> the Shore extends itſelf a great way into the Sea, and makes that Point of Land called <hi>Dengyneſs.</hi> Juſt by the River <hi>Rother,</hi> ſtands the little Town of <hi>Appledore,</hi> which, by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, has loſt its Market, and is of no Note now. The Sea formerly came up to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenterden,</hi> a Mayor Market-town, lies a little to the N. W. of <hi>Appledore,</hi> near the <hi>Weald.</hi> It has a very good and high Steeple, which they ſay was the Cauſe of the <hi>Godwin-Sands,</hi> which was an Eſtate that belonged to Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and was guarded
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0141100401:179"/>
from the Sea by a Wall; but they were ſo intent on building the Steeple, that the Wall was neglected, and the Land overflowed, which they could never afterwards recover.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſhford,</hi> alſo a Mayor-town, ſtands on the great Road, upon the River <hi>Stour.</hi> It is a pretty well built Market-town. The Church is large, and was formerly Collegiate: they hold Pleas for any thing not exceeding twenty Marks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newenden</hi> deſerves to be mentioned for what it once was, having been formerly a fine City, which <hi>Camden</hi> calls <hi>Anderida.</hi> It was deſtroy'd by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> but rebuilt in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> I. and called <hi>Newenden,</hi> as much as to ſay, according to <hi>Camden</hi>'s Etymology, a new City in a little Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. It had then an Harbour much frequented; but it is now a moſt miſerable Village, with a few poor Houſes in it; the beſt an Ale-houſe, and the Church is ill-built, and out of Repair. It has a very indifferent Bridge over the <hi>Rother,</hi> a rapid Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which divides at this Place <hi>Kent</hi> from <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and about Nine Miles off empties itſelf into the Harbour of <hi>Rye. Roman</hi> Coins have been dug up here.</p>
            <p>North-weſt of <hi>Newenden</hi> is <hi>Cranbrook,</hi> a large Market-town, noted for having been one of the firſt Places where the Cloth-manufacture was ſet up in <hi>England,</hi> which is now very much in its Wane here. But here I will conclude my Third Letter; and am, Sir,</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> NOW enter the County of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and ſhall begin my Letter with the Account of <hi>Rye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſituated in the moſt Eaſtern Part of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> upon an Hill, which is encompaſſed with Rocks, that are inacceſſible on the Sea-ſide. There is nothing now but ſome Remains of its old Walls to be ſeen, and the Ditches are almoſt filled up. Its Trade is in Hops, Wool, Timber, Kettles, Cannon, Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-backs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are caſt at the Iron-works at <hi>Bakely,</hi> about Four Miles from <hi>Rye,</hi> on the North-weſt, and <hi>Breed,</hi> about Five Miles diſtant South-weſt. It is a very great Misfortune, that its Harbour has been ſo much damaged by the Sea, and neglected; for it is almoſt filled up in ſeveral Places, where it was formerly the deepeſt, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. Some conſiderable Families, who have Lands near, have taken Advantage of this, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0141100401:181"/>
them further upon thoſe Sands, which the Sea in Storms has thrown up againſt them; and by digging Ditches, and making Drains, there are now Fields and Meadows, where antiently was nothing but Water. By this means Ships only of a middle Size can come within any convenient Diſtance of the Town, whereas formerly the largeſt Veſſels, and even whole Fleets together, could anchor juſt by the Rocks, on which the Town ſtands; and as this Port lies over-againſt <hi>Dieppe</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and that there is no other Port between <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> which can receive Ships of Burden, not only the Danger of the Sea, but in Time of War, of the Enemy, were eſcaped by the Conveniency of this Harbour. But it being by the Means I have mentioned, and by the Inning of the Chanel and waſte Lands, (which prevented the Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the Tide) in Danger of being utterly loſt, an Act of Parliament paſſed in 1721, which enacts, That no new Walls, Banks, Dams, or Stops, ſhall thereafter be erected on either Side of the Water, that might ſtop or alter the Flux or Reflux of the Sea, between the Mouth of the Harbour, bounded by the <hi>Camber</hi> and <hi>Caſtle-Points,</hi> and <hi>New Shutt</hi> near <hi>Craven</hi> Sluice.</p>
            <p>In 1723 another Act paſſed for completing the Repairs of the Harbour of <hi>Dover,</hi> and for reſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Harbour of <hi>Rye</hi> to its antient Goodneſs, which ſtill continued to be choak'd up, and almoſt ruin'd, by the Shifting of the Beach without, and Settling of the Sullage within, and ſtopping the Flux of the Tide, which this Act propoſed ſhould have its free Courſe thro' the <hi>Scotch-flat</hi> and <hi>Craven</hi> Sluices, or into ſuch other Cut or Chanel as ſhould be found moſt proper and expedient.</p>
            <p>And in 1724 another Act paſſed for making the laſt Act more effectual, ſo far as it related to the Harbour of <hi>Rye,</hi> in which a Power was given to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0141100401:182"/>
change the Deſign of making a Paſſage by the above-named Sluices, and to open a new Cut from the <hi>Winchelſea</hi> Chanel, right out to the Sea. And they actually began, in purſuance of this Act, to cut a broad and deep Canal, which was to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Sea on the Side of <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> for the Uſe of the two Boroughs. But ſtill theſe Proviſions being found inſufficient, another Act paſs'd in 1737-8, for continuing the Term and Powers granted by the former Acts, for repairing the Harbour of <hi>Dover,</hi> and for reſtoring that of <hi>Rye</hi> to its antient Goodneſs, to which I muſt refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>The Houſes of <hi>Rye</hi> are well-enough built, and of Brick, tho' generally old-faſhion'd; but there are ſome very neat ones of a modern Taſte. There is a ſmall Settlement of <hi>French</hi> Refugees in this Town, moſtly Fiſhermen; they have a Miniſter of their own, who is paid by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The Church is handſome and large; but there are ſo many Diſſenters in the Town, and ſo few of the Eſtabliſh'd Church, that they have wall'd off, and converted the Weſtern Part of it into a Magazine for Planks. But there are two well-built Meeting-houſes, one for the Preſbyterians, and the other for the Quakers. Another Church, which belong'd to a Monaſtery now demoliſh'd, is alſo turn'd into a kind of Store-houſe for Planks, Hops, and other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize. At the North-eaſt of <hi>Rye</hi> are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of an old Fort, which commands the Town and Harbour, and ſerves for the Town-gaol.</p>
            <p>His late Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> I. on his Return from <hi>Hanover, January</hi> 3. 1725-6, was obliged to put in here, after a very dangerous and tempeſtuous Paſſage, the Fleet being unable to make <hi>Dover</hi>; and it was then experienced, what a Benefit it would have been to have had this only conſiderable Haven, as it formerly was, between <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> reſtor'd to its priſtine flouriſhing State; for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0141100401:183"/>
was under great Difficulties to land there, and the larger Ships were unable to follow him.</p>
            <p>This Town was, as I have ſaid, one of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages, as <hi>Winchelſea</hi> was the other, to <hi>Haſtings,</hi> as a Cinque-port, and enjoy'd the ſame Privileges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Old Winchelſea</hi> ſtood upon the Sea-ſhore, about Two or Three Miles from the Place where the <hi>New</hi> ſtands. It had formerly a large and ſpacious Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, was a Place of great Trade, and had no leſs than Eighteen Churches in it. But it was intirely deſtroyed by the Sea, and that ſmall Part which is not bury'd in the Sands, is now Marſh and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-land. To the S. E. of <hi>Rye,</hi> and the N. W. of <hi>New Winchelſea,</hi> is ſtill to be ſeen, in the Midſt of a large Plain, an old Tower, which probably ſtood by the Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New Winchelſea</hi> is ſaid to have been built by King <hi>Edward</hi> I. partly on a Hill about Two Miles from the <hi>Old,</hi> and the like Diſtance from <hi>Rye,</hi> and partly in a little Valley, where it had an Harbour; but <hi>Anno</hi> 1250, the latter Part of this met with the ſame Fate as the former. It never was comparable to the old Town, having but three Pariſh Churches when it flouriſh'd, and now there only remains the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of one, which is more than large enough for the Inhabitants. But yet the Town was every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where accommodated with fine ſtone arch'd Vaults for ſtowing of Merchandize, and was laid out with admirable Regularity, the Streets being divided into 32 Quarters. Some of the Stone-work of the Three Gates are ſtill to be ſeen. The Sea is now above a Mile diſtant from it, the Harbour being choaked up with Sands; and Graſs grows not only where the Harbour was, but even in the Streets; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are only a few Houſes remaining in the upper Part of the Town. Among the Ruins of the Walls to the S. E. are the Remains of a Caſtle, as ſome ſay; or of a Monaſtery, as others will have it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0141100401:184"/>
               <hi>Haſtings</hi> is the Chief of the Five Cinque-ports, and with its Two Members above, was obliged to furniſh the King with Twenty Ships for any Naval Expedition, in Recompence for the ample Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities it enjoy'd, as one of the Five Ports. It is about Eight Miles from <hi>Winchelſea.</hi> It conſiſts of Two great Streets, with a Pariſh Church in each, and has ſeveral good Houſes; but its Harbour, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo famous, is now a poor Road for ſmall Veſſels, having been ruined by the Storms that from time to time have been ſo fatal to its neighbouring Ports of <hi>Rye</hi> and <hi>Winchelſea.</hi> We ſaw here the Ruins of an ancient Caſtle; and about Three Miles off, <hi>Bull-hide</hi> Haven, where <hi>William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror</hi> is ſaid to have landed in his Invaſion of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; tho' ſome ſay it was at <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and others at <hi>Pevenſey,</hi> an Harbour more Weſtward, which has likewiſe been deſtroy'd by the Sea; but be that as it will, it was at <hi>Haſtings</hi> that he muſter'd his Army, after he had burnt his Ships, being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to conquer or periſh in the Attempt; or rather, as another Author has obſerv'd, that he might not be obliged to divide his Army, which muſt have been the Caſe, if he had preſerv'd his Ships; and probably, while he made an Advance into the Country, at the Head of part of his Army, <hi>Harold</hi> might have ſtepp'd in between, and cut off thoſe who were left to guard the Ships, and then with more Eaſe have attack'd, and, perhaps, beat that Part commanded by the <hi>Norman</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>The deciſive Battle which he fought <hi>Anno</hi> 1066, with King <hi>Harold,</hi> was upon a Plain call'd <hi>Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> about Seven Miles from <hi>Haſtings,</hi> for an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which I ſhall refer to the Hiſtorians. In the Place where <hi>Harold</hi>'s Body was found, the <hi>Norman</hi> inſtituted an Abbey of <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks, dedicating it to St. <hi>Martin</hi>; and from the Fight aforeſaid, it is called <hi>Battle-Abbey</hi>; and ſoon drew to it, by a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0141100401:185"/>
Fair held every <hi>Sunday</hi> and Holiday, ſuch a Reſort, that it became a handſome Town. It ſtill retains the Name of <hi>Battle,</hi> and ſome Remains of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey are yet to be ſeen, and make Part of the Houſe of the Lord Viſcount <hi>Montacute,</hi> a Roman-catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peer; of which more in another Place.</p>
            <p>A little beyond <hi>Haſtings</hi> to <hi>Bourn,</hi> we ride upon the Sands in a ſtrait Line for Eighteen Miles, all upon the Coaſt of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Pemſey,</hi> or <hi>Peven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> Haven afore-mentioned, and the Mouth of the River, which comes from <hi>Battle,</hi> without ſo much as knowing, that there was a River, the Tide being out, and all the Water ſinking away in the Sands. This Town of <hi>Battle</hi> is remarkable for little now, but making the fineſt Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the beſt perhaps in <hi>Europe.</hi> Near <hi>Battle</hi> they ſhew us a Hill with a Beacon upon it, now called <hi>Beacon-hill,</hi> but was formerly call'd <hi>Standard-hill</hi>; where the <hi>Norman</hi> ſet up his Great Standard of Defiance, the Day before the deciſive Battle with <hi>Harold</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Beginning of <hi>Romney-marſh,</hi> that is to ſay, at <hi>Sandgate,</hi> or <hi>Sandfoot</hi> Caſtle, near <hi>Hythe,</hi> to this Place, the Country is a rich fertile Soil, full of feeding Grounds; and an incredible Number of large Sheep are fed every Year upon them, and ſent up to <hi>London</hi> Market. Theſe <hi>Romney-marſh</hi> Sheep are counted rather larger than the <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> and <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> Sheep, of which ſo much is ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>Beſides the vaſt Flocks of Sheep, as above, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of large Bullocks are fed in this Part of the Country; and eſpecially thoſe they call Stall'd or Houſe-fed Oxen, from their being kept within the Farmers Sheds or Yards all the latter Seaſon, where they are fed for the Winter-market, and generally deemed the largeſt Beef in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0141100401:186"/>In <hi>Romney-marſh,</hi> as in other Parts of <hi>England,</hi> are found great Timber-trees, lying at Length under Ground, as black as Ebony, and fit for Uſe, when dried in the Sun.</p>
            <p>From hence it was that, turning North, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing the deep, dirty, but rich Part of theſe Two Counties, my Curioſity led me to ſee the great Founderies, or Iron-works, which are in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and where they are carried on at ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Expence of Wood, that even in a Country almoſt all over-run with Timber, they begin to complain of the great Conſumption of it by thoſe Furnaces, and the Apprehenſion of leaving the next Age to want Timber for building their Navies. I muſt own however, that I conceived that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was intirely groundleſs, the Three Counties of <hi>Kent, Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> (all which lie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous one to another) being an inexhauſtible Store-houſe of Timber for this Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After I had been fatigued in paſſing this deep and heavy Part of the Country, I thought it would not be foreign to my Deſign, if I refreſhed myſelf with a View of <hi>Tunbridge-wells,</hi> which were not then above 12 Miles out of my Way.</p>
            <p>When I came to the <hi>Wells,</hi> which were Five Miles nearer to me than the Town, ſuppoſing me then at <hi>Battle,</hi> to the Southward of them, I found a great deal of good Company there; and particularly made an Obſervation, that thoſe People who have nothing to do any-where elſe, ſeem to be the buſieſt People at <hi>Tunbridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Appearance is over at the Wells, (where the Ladies are all in <hi>Deſhabile</hi>) and at the Chapel, the Company go home; and, as if it was another Species of People, or a Collection from another Place, you are ſurpriſed to ſee the Walks covered with Ladies completely dreſſed, and gay to Profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0141100401:187"/>
where rich Cloaths, Jewels, and Beauty, dazzle the Eyes from one End of the Range to the other.</p>
            <p>As for Gaming, Sharping, Intriguing, as alſo Fops, Beaux, and the like, <hi>Tunbridge</hi> uſed to be as full of theſe as moſt other publick Places; but the Act lately paſſed againſt Gaming has, in a great meaſure, cured this Evil. Of this Act I ſhall ſay more, when I come to <hi>Bath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Air here is excellent, and the Proviſions of all Sorts very reaſonable: particularly they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with excellent Fiſh, of almoſt all Sorts, from <hi>Rye,</hi> and other Towns on the Sea-coaſt; and I ſaw a Turbut of near twenty Pounds Weight ſold there for Three Shillings. In the Seaſon of Mackarel, they have them here from <hi>Haſtings,</hi> within three Hours of their being taken out of the Sea; and the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which that makes in their Goodneſs, I need not mention.</p>
            <p>They have likewiſe here abundance of Wild-fowl, of the beſt Sorts; ſuch as Pheaſants, Partridges, Woodcocks, Snipes, Quails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> particularly they have from the <hi>South-downs</hi> the Bird called a <hi>Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear,</hi> or which I think I may call the <hi>Engliſh Orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>—the moſt delicious Taſte for one Mouthful, (for 'tis hardly more) that can be imagined; but theſe are very dear at <hi>Tunbridge:</hi> they are much cheaper at <hi>Seaford, Lewes,</hi> and that Side of the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tunbridge</hi> is ſituated upon the little River <hi>Tunn,</hi> which runs into the <hi>Medway</hi> hard by. On the Southern Bank of the River are to be ſeen the Ruins of an old Caſtle, built by a natural Son of <hi>Richard</hi> I. Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who, as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> tells us, exchanged his Lordſhip of <hi>Bryany</hi> in that Duchy for <hi>Tunbridge.</hi> The Church is a modern Building; the Houſes in the Town are moſtly ill-built, and the Streets ſorrily paved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0141100401:188"/>The Wells are about Four Miles from the Town, and the Rocks about Ten Miles from them, and worth a Traveller's Curioſity to ſee, as they are ſeveral prodigious Heaps of firm Stone Rocks, tho' ſome Miles diſtant from the Sea.</p>
            <p>The Buildings at the Wells have much the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of thoſe in <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and may be ſaid to conſtitute a large and populous Town themſelves. There is a Church, or rather Chapel of Eaſe, which is very neat. This new Town, as I may call it, ſtands in a Bottom between Two Hills, one of which is called <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and the other <hi>Mount Ephraim,</hi> which are generally covered with good Houſes, fine Gardens, and Fruit-trees. The Wells might be more properly called <hi>Spelhurſt Wells</hi>; for the Water riſes in a Pariſh of that Name. The Well which contains them is well-paved, like a Ciſtern, and ſurrounded with a low Wall, with a Pair of Stairs to go down. The Company walk upon the Two above-named Hills, after they have drank the Waters, and divert themſelves with Bowls, Dancing, or other Exerciſes, as the Weather will permit, and the Phyſicians preſcribe. Near the Well is a long Gallery, paved and covered over, wherein to walk in bad Weather, and while they are taking the Waters, and where likewiſe the Band of Muſick have place. There are alſo Rooms to drink Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or Coffee, and to play at Cards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> likewiſe a Hall to dance in. Not far off the Well is a Market well ſtored with Proviſions of all Sorts.</p>
            <p>A very eminent Phyſician is of Opinion, that the Waters of <hi>Bath, Tunbridge, Chiltenham,</hi> (or <hi>Scarborough,</hi> which partake of the ſame Qualities) and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> make the general Kinds of moſt of the various Mineral Waters on the Globe; and that he therefore who underſtands theſe, cannot be much at a Loſs to determine the Virtues and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0141100401:189"/>
of any new Kind. And as this learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has favoured me with his Opinion of theſe ſeveral Waters, I ſhall communicate the ſame in their reſpective Places.</p>
            <p>And, firſt, this is what he ſays of the Nature, Efficacy and Qualities of theſe of <hi>Tunbridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Tunbridge</hi> Waters, ſays he, are nothing but an Impregnation of Rain, or compreſſed Cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters in ſome of the Eminencies of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Country. And indeed all Hills, and conſpicuous Elevations, are mere hollow Neſts of ſome Minerals. Iron and Sulphur are the moſt common and univerſal Minerals; and almoſt all Kinds of Stone fit for making Fences or Edifices, have in their Compoſition one or both of them. All the Varieties of hard, black, dark or greyiſh Stones, abound with ferrugineous Particles; and Iron is ſo neceſſary, eſpecially in Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tropicks and the Poles, for Huſbandry, that there is ſcarce a Mile ſquare within this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, where it may not be found with its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated Waters. This is demonſtrable by the Action of the Loadſtone on moſt Minerals, the Magnet itſelf ſeeming to be ſcarce any thing but a purer Clod of Iron: and pure poliſhed Iron, we know, with very ſimple Management, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes highly magnetick. Hence we account for the Frequency of chalybeat Mineral Waters, of ſome Degree of Strength or other, ſo readily to be found between the Poles and Tropicks. And this is a bountiful Proviſion of Nature to thoſe colder Climates, where animal Food, and fermented Liquors, are ſo neceſſary for the Support, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and greater Proportion of animal Force required in them, for their Defence from the Swarming of ravenous Animals, and for hunting animal Food, where the Vegetable is neither ſo proper, nutritive, nor abounding, as in theſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0141100401:190"/>
kindlier Climates between the Tropicks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each Side of the Equator. Mineral Chalybeat Waters brace the Solids, which animal Food, and fermented Liquors, in any Plenty, are apt to relax; and wind up the Springs of animal Motion, to keep the Blood fluid, which the juſt mentioned Indulgencies are diſpoſed to thicken. Soft Stone, Marl, alkalious Clay, and all Kinds of bituminous Earths, have a larger Quantity of Sulphur in them; for Sulphur, Oil, and Bitumen, always leave Earth brittle, ſpongy, and alkalious (Alkalies being only an harder earthy Sponge); and when the watry Impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions meet, they naturally produce by Fermentation ſome Degree of Heat in the Mixture. There is in Nature, as this learned Gentleman thinks, but one kind of Salt, which is Nitre; and that the Variety ariſes from a Mixture of Sulphur, Earth, or Iron, in different Proportions combined in their Compoſition. Nitre however, and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalt, have their principal Efficacy from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Principle in their Texture: and thus <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Waters are only a finer Solution of blue Vitriol, or natural Salt of Steel, or Rain-waters, inimitable by Art in ſuch ſalutary Effects as Nature always produces. For Example: Tho' Art may imitate, in precious Stones, all the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Colours, Reflexions, Refractions, and Emiſſions of Light; yet there is always ſome one peculiar Property, as of Hardneſs, Weight, or Water, which diſcovers the Sophiſtication. In like manner, all the Wines on the Globe may be ſo imitated, that neither Eye, nor Palate, nor the Perception of their Effects on Animal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, can diſcover the Fiction; and this without one Drop of the Juice of the Grape, from the ſaccharine Quality only of almoſt all Fruits, Seeds,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0141100401:191"/>
or Herbs: yet by analyſing them in ſome proper Menſtruum, the Cheat may be found out. Thus we may imitate all the ſeveral Mineral Waters on the Earth, and pretty nearly conciliate all their general or groſſer ſalutary Virtues on diſeaſed Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals: yet there is an unaccountable Something in the Taſte, Lightneſs on the Stomach, Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Alacrity they give, which all our Skill can never beſtow. The Principle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation, the Size of their laſt and leaſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, the Proportion of the ſeveral Parts of the Compoſition to the watry Menſtruum, and the due Time of their Impregnation, are and ever will be unknown to us; as will conſequently the Degree required to wind up, ſtrengthen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the relaxed Solids of diſeaſed human Bodies, to ſuch a Height, that they may be enabled to grind, diſſolve, and thin the concreted Juices, as theſe active, ſtrong, and invigorating Waters of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> uſually do: for in all robuſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions but partially depraved, in the cold chronical Diſtempers of ſuch Habits, in nervous Diſorders, and low Spirits, in weak Digeſtions, and groſs Habits, they are extremely ſucceſsful, eſpecially in the hotter Seaſons of the Year."</q>
Thus far this learned Gentleman.</p>
            <p>During the time I was at <hi>Tunbridge</hi> formerly, I made an Excurſion to <hi>Knowl-houſe,</hi> about Seven Miles from <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and One from <hi>Sevenoak,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Duke of <hi>Dorſet:</hi> it is ſituated in the Middle of a Park, and at that time was an antient Stone Fabrick; but had nothing more remarkable in it, than ſome excellent Pictures.</p>
            <p>I left <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and came to <hi>Lewes,</hi> through the deepeſt, dirtieſt, but in many reſpects the richeſt, and moſt profitable Country in all that Part of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0141100401:192"/>The Timber I ſaw here was prodigious, as well for Size as Plenty, and ſeemed in ſome Places ſuffered to grow, only becauſe it was ſo far off of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, that it was not worth carrying away. In dry Summers, indeed, a great deal is carried away to <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> and other Places on the <hi>Medway</hi>; and ſometimes I have ſeen one Tree on a Carriage, which they call there a <hi>Tug,</hi> drawn by 22 Oxen; and even then 'tis carried ſo little a Way, (being thrown down, and left for other <hi>Tugs</hi> to take up, and carry on) that ſometimes 'tis Two or Three Years before it gets to <hi>Chatham</hi>; for if once the Rains begin, it ſtirs no more that Year, and ſometimes a whole Summer is not dry enough to make the Roads paſſable.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall obſerve, according to my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>p.</hi> 151. That in the Year 1739-40, an Act paſſed, intituled, <hi>An Act to revive, explain and amend an Act made in the</hi> 16<hi>th and</hi> 17<hi>th Years of the Reign of his late Majeſty K.</hi> Charles II. <hi>intituled, An Act for making the River of</hi> Medway <hi>navigable, in the Counties of</hi> Kent <hi>and</hi> Suſſex: And which, when completed, muſt be of very great Uſe to the Publick, as well as to the Counties of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p>The Preamble to this Act will ſet this Matter in a proper Light, and it is to this Effect; That the above-mentioned Act of Parliament of the 16th and 17th of <hi>Charles</hi> II. was never yet carried into Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; altho' the making the ſaid River navigable was likely to be of great Utility to the Publick, by reaſon of great Quantities of Timber growing on the <hi>Wealds</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which is allowed to be the beſt in the Kingdom, for the Uſe of the Royal Navy, and which now, thro' the Badneſs of the Roads in thoſe Parts, cannot be convey'd to any Market but at a large Expence.</p>
            <p>That therefore the preſent Undertakers, being deſirous to begin, carry on and complete the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0141100401:193"/>
of ſuch Part of the antient River <hi>Medway</hi> and Streams falling into it, as run from <hi>Foreſt-row</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> to <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> this Act incorporates them for that Purpoſe, by the Name of <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Proprietors of the Navigation of the River</hi> Medway.</p>
            <p>We muſt refer to the Act itſelf for farther Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and ſhall only obſerve, That when this Work is completed, it will be of inconceivable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Publick; not only for the excellent Timber which it will be a Means of conveying to proper Markets, but for the eaſy and ſpeedy Carriage of Iron, Ordnance, Balls, and other Materials of War forged in or near the ſaid River, which at ſome times of the Year cannot be brought thro' the <hi>Wealds</hi> of the Two Counties; and for the Carriage of Wood, Corn, Grain, Hay, Hops, Wooll, Leather, and all manner of Proviſions, as alſo of Coals, Lime, Stone Wares, and all other Neceſſaries and Commodities, to the great Improvement of Trade and Commerce.</p>
            <p>A few Miles North-weſt of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> lies <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oak,</hi> ſo called from Seven large Oaks that grew near the Place. It is a Market-town, governed by a Warden and Aſſiſtants; but is noted for nothing more than being a great Thorough-fare Town. It has a good Hoſpital for maintaining and teaching poor Children, erected by Sir <hi>William Sevenoak,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who was a Foundling, and took his Name from the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewes</hi> is a pleaſant Town, large, well-built, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſituated in the Middle of an open Champain Country, and on the Edge of the <hi>South-downs,</hi> the moſt delightful of their Kind in the Nation; it lies on the Bank of a little wholſome freſh River, within 12 Miles of the Sea, and was formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a Wall; but there are few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it now to be ſeen. But what contributes to the Advantage of this Town is, that both it and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0141100401:194"/>
the Country adjacent, are full of Gentlemen of good Families and Fortunes; of which the <hi>Pelhams</hi> muſt be named with the firſt, whoſe Chief is his Grace the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> Here are alſo the antient Families of <hi>Gage, Shelly,</hi> &amp;c. formerly Roman-catholicks, but now Proteſtants, with many others, <hi>Lewes</hi> has Five Churches in it. Near it is an old demoliſh'd Caſtle, in the Neighbourhood of which was fought that bloody Battle between King <hi>Henry</hi> III. and his Barons; the Event of which conſtrained the King to accept of hard Conditions of Peace, and to give his Son as an Hoſtage for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
            <p>I ought not to forget, that <hi>Newhaven</hi> in this Neighbourhood was formerly noted for its ſafe and good Harbour for Ships of conſiderable Burden; but for want of a Proviſion for maintaining the Timber Piers, which it had for Time immemorial, it was quite neglected, and the Harbour choaked up with Sand and Beach, and the Piers were rotten and decay'd. To remedy theſe Evils, an Act paſſed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1731, for Repairing and Keeping in Repair the ſaid Piers and Harbour. And when brought to Effect, not only <hi>Lewes,</hi> but the adjacent Parts, as well as the whole Kingdom, will be the better for it.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Lewes,</hi> following ſtill the Range of the <hi>South-Downs,</hi> Weſt, we ride in View of the Sea, and on a fine Carpet Ground, for about 12 Miles to <hi>Brighthelmſton,</hi> a poor Fiſhing-town, old-built, and on the very Shore of the Sea. Hence again, as I mentioned at <hi>Folkſtone</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> the Fiſhermen, having large Barks, go away to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to the Fiſhing Fair there, and hire themſelves out for the Seaſon to catch Herrings for the Merchants; and they tell us, that theſe make a very good Buſineſs of it.</p>
            <p>The Sea is very unkind to <hi>Brighthelmſton,</hi> having by its continual Encroachments, ſo gained upon
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0141100401:195"/>
the Town, that in a little time more the Inhabitants may reaſonably expect it will eat away the whole Place, above 100 Houſes having been devoured by the Water in a few Years paſt.</p>
            <p>From hence, ſtill keeping the Coaſt on the Left, we come to <hi>Shoreham,</hi> a Sea-faring Town, chiefly inhabited by Ship-carpenters, Ship-chandlers, and all the ſeveral Trades depending upon the Building and Fitting up of Ships, which is their chief Buſineſs. They are indeed juſtly noted for good Sailors, and for building neat and ſtout Sea-boats, which yet, in Strength and Duration, do not come up to thoſe of <hi>Yarmouth, Ipſwich,</hi> and the North.</p>
            <p>The Builders of Ships ſeem to have ſettled here chiefly becauſe of the exceeding Quantity and Cheapneſs of Timber in the Country behind them; being the ſame wooded Country I mentioned above, which ſtill continues thro' this County and the next. The River this Town ſtands upon, tho' not navigable for large Veſſels, yet ſerves to bring down this large Timber in Floats from <hi>Bramber, Steyning,</hi> and the Country adjacent; which is, in a manner, all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Timber.</p>
            <p>Here in the Compaſs of about Six Miles are Three Borough Towns, ſending Members to Parliament, <hi>(viz.) Shoreham, Bramber,</hi> and <hi>Steyning. Shoreham</hi> and <hi>Steyning</hi> are pretty little Market-towns; but <hi>Bramber,</hi> after I have mentioned the Ruins of an old Caſtle, hardly deſerves the Name of a Town, having not above 20 Families in it, and of them but few above aſking Alms, as you ride by. The chief Houſe in the Town, when I was there, was a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-houſe, the Landlord whereof boaſted, that upon an Election, juſt then over, he had made 300<hi>l.</hi> of one Pipe of Canary.</p>
            <p>This is not the only Town in this County, where the Elections have been ſcandalouſly mercenary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it has been ſaid, there was in one King's
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0141100401:196"/>
Reign more Money ſpent at Elections than all the Lands in the Pariſhes were worth, at 20 Years Purchaſe. I ſhall name in particular but one more, and that is <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> which is rather the Skeleton of an antient City, than a real Town, where the old Gates ſtand near Three Miles from one another over the Fields, and the very Ruins are ſo buried, that they have made good Corn Fields of the Streets, and the Plough goes over the Foundations, nay, over the firſt Floors of the Houſes, and where nothing of a Town ſeems to remain; yet at one Election for Members, the Struggle was ſuch, between Sir <hi>John Banks,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Draper</hi> a neighbouring Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that I was aſſured the latter ſpent 11,000<hi>l.</hi> and loſt it too. What the other ſpent, who oppoſed him, may be gueſſed at, ſeeing he who ſpent moſt was always ſure to carry it.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Steyning,</hi> the famous Baronet of the Name of <hi>Fagg</hi> hath an antient Seat. And thence paſſing by the Seat of Sir <hi>John Shelly,</hi> prettily ſituated in the Middle of a Grove, we come to <hi>Arundel,</hi> a decay'd Town alſo. It ſtands near the Mouth of the River <hi>Arun,</hi> which heretofore had a good Harbour called <hi>Arundel Port,</hi> or the Harbour of <hi>Little Hampton,</hi> capable of receiving Ships and Veſſels of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Burden; but a Beach being thrown up by the Sea, it was quite choaked up, and the Navigation of the <hi>Arun</hi> obſtructed, ſo that the Harbour was rendered in a manner uſeleſs. But in the Year 1733, an Act paſſed for erecting Piers in, and for Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Keeping in Repair the Harbour there, by cutting a Chanel thro' the Beach and old Piers, and erecting Locks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One great Advantage to the Country from this River, is the Shipping off great Quantities of large Timber here; which is carried up the <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>Woolwich</hi> and <hi>Deptford,</hi> and up the <hi>Medway</hi> to <hi>Chatham</hi>; as alſo Weſtward to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and even
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0141100401:197"/>
to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to the new Dock there, and indeed to all the King's Yards, where the Buſineſs of the Navy is carried on. The Timber ſhipped off here is eſteemed the beſt and largeſt that is brought by Sea from any Part of <hi>England</hi>; alſo great Quantities of Knee Timber are had here, the largeſt of which is valuable in its kind above the ſtrait Timber.</p>
            <p>This River, and the old, decay'd, once famous Caſtle at <hi>Arundel,</hi> which has the Privilege to give to its Poſſeſſor the Title of an Earl and Peer of the Realm, without Creation, and which belongs to the noble Family of <hi>Howard,</hi> Earls of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and Dukes of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> is all that is remarkable here; except it be, that in the Church are Four old and ſtately Monuments of the Earls of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and that in this River are catch'd the beſt and largeſt Mullets in <hi>England,</hi> a Fiſh very good in itſelf, and much valued by the Gentry round, and often ſent up to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence to the City of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> are 12 of the moſt pleaſant and beautiful Miles in <hi>England,</hi> whether we go by the Hill, or Downs, or by the Plain, or incloſed Country.</p>
            <p>To the North of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and at the Bottom of the Hills, and conſequently in the <hi>Weald,</hi> is the Town of <hi>Petworth,</hi> a large handſome Country Market-town, and very populous; and as it ſtands upon an Aſcent, and is dry and healthy, it is full of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Families, and good well-built Houſes, both in the Town and Neighbourhood; but the Beauty of <hi>Petworth</hi> is the antient Seat of the old Family of <hi>Piercy,</hi> Earls of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> now extinct; whoſe Daughter, the ſole Heireſs of all his vaſt Eſtates, married <hi>Charles Seymour</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>; and among other noble Seats brought his Grace this of <hi>Petworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke pull'd down the antient Houſe, and on the ſame Spot built from the Ground one of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0141100401:198"/>
beſt-modell'd Houſes then in <hi>Britain:</hi> it had the Misfortune to be once almoſt demoliſhed by Fire, but the Damage has been fully repaired.</p>
            <p>The Apartments are very noble, well contrived, and richly furniſhed; but it cannot be ſaid, that the Situation of the Houſe is choſen ſo happily, as to boaſt of equal Judgment with the reſt; the Avenues to the Front want Space, the Houſe ſtands, as it were, with its Elbow to the Town; its Front has no <hi>Viſta</hi> anſwerable, and the Weſt Front look'd not to the Parks or fine Gardens, but to the old Stables.</p>
            <p>To rectify this, when it was too late to order it any other way, the Duke was obliged to pull down thoſe noble Buildings; I mean the Meuſe, or Stables, the fineſt of their kind in all the South of <hi>England,</hi> and equal to ſome Noblemens whole Houſes: and yet even the demoliſhing the Pile has done no more than opened a Proſpect over the Country, whereas, had the Houſe been ſet on the riſing Ground, on the Side of the Park, over-againſt the North Wing of the Houſe, and a little more to the Weſtward, the Front had been South to the Town, the back Front to the Parks; but now all theſe Advantages lie on one Angle, or oppoſite to one Wing of the Houſe. Nevertheleſs it is a noble Pile of Building, and by far the fineſt in all this Part of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Petworth</hi> Weſt, the Country is a little leſs woody than the <hi>Weald</hi>; and a great many fine Seats begin to ſhew their Heads above the Trees; as the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi>'s Seat at <hi>Godwood,</hi> near <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>; the Seats of the late Earl of <hi>Tankerville,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Scarborough</hi>; and a great many others.</p>
            <p>But the Seat of the Right Honourable the Lord Viſc. <hi>Montacute,</hi> called <hi>Cowdrey,</hi> near <hi>Midhurſt,</hi> the <hi>Midae</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> deſerves a particular Mention. It is ſituated in a Valley encompaſſed with Lawns,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0141100401:199"/>
Hills, and Woods, thrown into a Park, the River running underneath, which renders the Place very agreeable in Summer, but makes it dampiſh in Winter. The Houſe is ſquare, and at each Corner is a <hi>Gothick</hi> Tower, which have a very good Effect, when viewed from the riſing Grounds. The Hall is ceiled with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Oak, after the antient manner. The Walls are painted with Architecture by <hi>Roberti,</hi> the Statues by <hi>Goupé,</hi> the Stair-caſe by <hi>Pelegrini.</hi> The large Parlour or Room at the End of the Hall, is of <hi>Holbein</hi>'s Painting; where that great Artiſt has deſcribed the Exploits of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. before <hi>Boloigne, Calais,</hi> his Landing at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> his magnificent Entry into <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. In the other Rooms are many excellent Pictures of the Anceſtors of the Family, and other Hiſtory Paintings of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bein,</hi> relating to their Actions in War. The whole Circuit of Rooms are ſtately and well-furniſhed, adorned with many Pictures. There is a long Gallery with the Twelve Apoſtles as big as the Life; another very neat one, wainſcotted with <hi>Norway</hi> Oak, where are many antient Whole-length Pictures of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in their proper Habits. There are four Hiſtory-pieces, two Copies of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Marriage of <hi>Cupid</hi> and <hi>Pſyche</hi>; ſeveral old religious and military Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from <hi>Battle-abbey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Park is very noble, having a great Variety of Grounds in it, and is well wooded with <hi>Pines, Firs,</hi> and other Evergreen-trees, which are grown to a large Size; and here are ſome of the largeſt Cheſnut-trees perhaps in <hi>England.</hi> The Valleys which run thro' the Park, are well ſupplied with Water, which keeps the Graſs in a conſtant Verdure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chicheſter</hi> is a neat and pretty large City walled round. The River <hi>Lavant</hi> runs under Part of the Walls. Two principal Streets croſs it at right Angles upon the cardinal Points, where ſtands a curious
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0141100401:200"/>
Croſs, and Market-houſe upon Pillars, erected by Biſhop <hi>Read.</hi> The Church takes up one of theſe Quadrants. It is remarkable for Two Side-iſles on both Sides, and the Pictures of all the Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> ſince <hi>Ciſſa,</hi> (the South <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarch, who made this his Royal Seat; and repaired the antient <hi>Roman</hi> Caſtle or Walls, leaving his Name to the Place) on the Southern Wall, as on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Wall, all the Biſhops. The Spire is a Piece of excellent Workmanſhip, but it received ſuch a Shock ſome Years ago, that it was almoſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that the Steeple did not fall down; which, if it had, would probably have demoliſhed the whole Church.</p>
            <p>It was what the Inhabitants call a Fire-ball, or rather Lightning, which broke upon the Steeple, with ſuch irreſiſtible Force, that it drove ſeveral great Stones out of it, and carried them clear off, to a prodigious Diſtance from the Steeple. One of theſe Stones, of at leaſt a Ton Weight, was blown over the South Side or Row of Houſes in the Weſt Street, and fell on the Ground in the Street, at a Gentleman's Door, on the other Side of the Way: and another of them, almoſt as big, was blown over both Sides of the ſaid Weſt Street, into the ſame Gentleman's Garden, and no Hurt done by either of them. This Account I relate from a Perſon of undoubted Credit, who was an Eye-witneſs, and ſaw the Stones. The Breach made thereby in the Spire, tho' within about 45 Feet of the Top, was incredibly large, and yet the Steeple ſtood faſt, and is now very ſubſtantially repaired; which ſhews, that it was originally an admirably ſound and well finiſhed Piece of Workmanſhip. The Monuments of Biſhop <hi>Carleton</hi> and Biſhop <hi>King</hi> are in this Church, whoſe Effigies are curiouſly done in Marble.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1723, in digging a Foundation at <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> was found, pretty deep in the Ground, a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0141100401:201"/>
large Stone Six Feet long and Three broad, with a <hi>Roman</hi> Inſcription on it. In digging up the Stone, a few of the Letters were eras'd, but they were eaſily ſupplied.<q>
                  <hi>Neptuno et Minervae Templum, pro ſalute domus divinae, ex auctoritate Tiberii Claudii, Cogidubni regis, legati Auguſti in Britannia, Collegium fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brorum, et qui in eo a ſacris, vel honorati ſunt, de ſuo dedicaverunt; donante aream Pudente Pudentini filio.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>That is,</hi>
               <q>This Temple was dedicated to <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> for the Safety of the Imperial Family, by the Authority of <hi>Tiberius Claudius.</hi> It was erected by the College of Artificers of King <hi>Cogidubnus, Auguſtus</hi>'s Lieutenant in <hi>Britain,</hi> and by thoſe who officiated as Prieſts, or were honoured in it, at their own Expence; the Ground being given by <hi>Pudens,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentinus.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Stone was preſented to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who has placed it in a Temple on a Mount in his Garden at <hi>Godwood,</hi> between two Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Minerva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This City is not a Place of much Trade, nor is it very populous; but within theſe few Years they are fallen into a new way of managing the Corn Trade here, which turns very well to Account; for whereas the Farmers, generally ſpeaking, uſed to carry all their Wheat to <hi>Farnham</hi> Market, which is very near Forty Miles by Land-carriage, and from ſome Parts of the Country more than that, ſome money'd Men of <hi>Chicheſter, Emſworth,</hi> and other Places adjacent, join'd their Stocks together, and built large Granaries near the <hi>Crook,</hi> where the Veſſels come up; and here they buy and lay up all
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0141100401:202"/>
the Corn which the Country on that Side can ſpare; and having good Mills in the Neighbourhood, they grind and dreſs the Corn, and ſend it to <hi>London</hi> in the Meal, by long Sea.</p>
            <p>This is a great leſſening to <hi>Farnham</hi> Market; but if the Market at <hi>London</hi> is ſupply'd, the coming by Sea from <hi>Chicheſter</hi> is every whit as much a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, as the encouraging of <hi>Farnham</hi> Market, which is of itſelf the greateſt Corn-market in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; Hempſtead</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. This carrying of Meal by Sea is now pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed from ſeveral other Places on this Coaſt, even as far as <hi>Southampton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> beſides the Cathedral, has Five ſmall Churches. About Three Miles from it, is a Houſe of his Grace the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> called <hi>Godwood.</hi> It was the antient Seat of the Earls of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and in a very ruinous Condition; but the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> has lately built ſome Offices, which are to correſpond with a Manſion-houſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by <hi>Colin Campbel,</hi> and publiſh'd by him in his <hi>Vitruvius Britannicus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Grace has a noble <hi>Menagerie,</hi> where he keeps a great Variety of foreign Animals and Birds; but the Park is ſmall and ill-planted.</p>
            <p>However, it has an eaſy Deſcent to the Eaſt, South and South-weſt, with the Proſpect of a rich and beautiful Landſkip, bounded by the Sea for Thirty Miles in Length. The <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> terminates the South-weſt Proſpect, and the famous <hi>St. Rooks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill</hi> covers it from the North.</p>
            <p>About Three Miles to the Eaſt of <hi>Godwood,</hi> lies <hi>Charlton,</hi> a ſmall Village, remarkable for being the Seat of Fox-hunters; here are many ſmall Hunting-houſes built by Perſons of Quality, who reſide there during the Seaſon for Fox-hunting; but the moſt beautiful of theſe Buildings, is that of his Grace the Duke of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0141100401:203"/>Here is alſo a large Room, which was deſign'd by the Right Hon. the Earl of <hi>Burlington,</hi> where the Gentlemen Fox-hunters dine every Day toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, during their Stay at the Village.</p>
            <p>By the Side of this Village is a Foreſt, which was formerly in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Lumlies,</hi> but has been for ſome Years his Grace the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s, who has greatly beautified it, by cutting fine Ridings thro' the ſeveral Parts of it, and making many new Plantations therein.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> the Road lying ſtill Weſt, we paſs in Sight of the Earl of <hi>Scarborough</hi>'s fine Seat at <hi>Stanſted,</hi> a Houſe ſurrounded with thick Woods, thro' which there are the moſt agreeable Viſta's cut, that are to be ſeen any-where in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and particularly at the Weſt Opening, which is from the Front of the Houſe, they ſit in the Dine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room, and ſee the Town and Harbour of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> the Ships at <hi>Spithead,</hi> and alſo at <hi>St. Helen</hi>'s; which, when the Royal Navy happens to be there, is a moſt glorious Sight.</p>
            <p>In our Paſſage to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> we paſs'd by <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and by <hi>Portcheſter,</hi> a Caſtle built out of a <hi>Roman</hi> City.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Haven a Thouſand Sail of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Ships may ride ſecure. The Mouth is not ſo broad as the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and that ſecur'd on <hi>Goſport</hi> Side by <hi>Charles</hi> Fort, <hi>James</hi> Fort, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> Fort, and <hi>Block-houſe</hi> Fort, which has a Plat-form of above 20 great Guns level with the Water. On the other Side by <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> ſtands <hi>South-ſea</hi> Caſtle, built by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has within theſe few Years bought more Ground for additional Works, and no doubt it may be made impregnable; for a ſhallow Water may be brought quite round it. The Yards, the Docks, the Store-houſes, where all the Furniture is laid up
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0141100401:204"/>
in the exacteſt Order, ſo that the Workmen can find any Implement in the Dark, exceed Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as do the immenſe Quantities of all ſorts of military and naval Stores. The Rope-houſe is 870 Feet long, one continued Room, almoſt a Quarter of a Mile. I had the Pleaſure of ſeeing a great Cable made here: it requires 100 Men to work at it, and ſo hard is the Labour, that they can work but Four Hours in the Day. The ſmalleſt Number of Men continually employed in the Yard is 1000, and that but barely ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo a good Counterſcarp, and double Mote, with Ravelins in the Ditch, and double Paliſadoes, and advanc'd Works to cover the Place from any Approach, where it may be practicable. The Strength of the Town is alſo conſiderably aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on the Land-ſide, by the Fortifications raiſed of late Years about the Docks and Yards; and thoſe Parts made a particular Strength by themſelves; and tho' they are indeed in ſome Senſe independent one of another, yet they cover and ſtrengthen one another, ſo that they cannot be ſeparately attack'd on that Side, while they are both in the ſame Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. began theſe Fortifications; <hi>Henry</hi> VII. conſiderably augmented them; <hi>Charles</hi> II. much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd them; and King <hi>James</hi> II. greatly added to them. I was ſorry to leave this amazing Scene of naval Grandeur, for the Sight of a wretched Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of King <hi>William</hi> III. gilt indeed in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, but the very worſt of all the bad Works of this kind I have yet ſeen. I obſerv'd the great Quantity of Water and Ditches hereabout is apt to render the Place aguiſh.</p>
            <p>Theſe Docks and Yards are now like a Town by themſelves, and are a kind of Marine Corporation within themſelves; there being particular large Rows of Dwellings, built at the publick Charge, within the new Works, for all the principal Officers of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0141100401:205"/>
Place; eſpecially the Commiſſioner, the Agent of the Victualling, and ſuch-like.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> is a well inhabited, thriving Corporation; and hath been greatly enriched of late by the Fleet's having ſo often and ſo long lain there, as well as large Fleets of Merchant-men; beſides, the conſtant fitting out of Men of War here, and the often paying them at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> has made a great Reſort of People to it. Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> ſo long ago as the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> takes notice, that <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth was populous in time of War, but not ſo in time of Peace:</hi> but now the Buſineſs of the Navy is ſo much increaſed, and ſo much of it always done here, that it may be ſaid, that there is more to do at <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> now in time of Peace, than was then in time of War.</p>
            <p>The Government of the Place is by a Mayor and Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Civil Government is no more interrupted by the Military, than if there was no Gariſon there: ſo that we have very ſeldom had any Complaint either of Want of Diſcipline among the Soldiers, or Want of Prudence in the Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>Since the Increaſe of Buſineſs at this Place, the Confluence of People has been ſo great, that the Town not admitting any Inlargement for Buildings, a kind of Suburb, or rather a new Town, has been built on the heathy Ground adjoining, which is ſo conſiderable, that it threatens to outdo, for Numbers of Inhabitants, and Beauty of Buildings, even the Town itſelf; and the rather, as it is unconfin'd by the Laws of the Gariſon, and unincumber'd with the Corporation Burdens, Freedoms, Town-duties, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and the like.</p>
            <p>Next we arriv'd at the <hi>Portſdown</hi> Hills, which are of Chalk, and at a reaſonable Diſtance from the Shore extend themſelves into <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we turn'd to admire the Face of the Ground we had paſs'd. The Ports, Creeks, Bays, Ocean,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0141100401:206"/>
Caſtles and Ships, the <hi>Iſle of Wight, Portcheſter,</hi> the conſiderable Town of <hi>Goſport, Portſmouth, Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Chicheſter,</hi> and all the Coaſt from <hi>Portland</hi> Iſle to <hi>Suſſex,</hi> were comprehended under one View.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> Weſt, the Country lies low and flat, is full of Creeks and Inlets of the Sea and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, all the Way to <hi>Southampton,</hi> ſo that we ferry over three times in about 18 Miles; beſides going over the Bridge at <hi>Tichfield.</hi> The firſt of theſe Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> itſelf, <hi>(viz.)</hi> croſs the Mouth of the Harbour, from the <hi>Point</hi> above-mention'd, to <hi>Goſport,</hi> a large Town, and of great Trade, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in time of War. From thence we ride to <hi>Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> as above, where we paſs the River <hi>Alre,</hi> which riſes in the ſame County at <hi>Alresford,</hi> or near it, which is not above Twenty-two Miles off; and yet it is a large River here, and makes a good Road below, call'd <hi>Tichfield-bay.</hi> Thence at about Four Miles we paſs another River at <hi>Buſſelton,</hi> narrow in Breadth, but exceeding deep, and eminent for its being able to carry the largeſt Ships: here is a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-yard for Ships of War; and in King <hi>William</hi>'s Time, Two Eighty-gun Ships were launch'd here. It ſeems, the Safety of the Creek, and the Plenty of Timber in the Country behind it, is the Reaſon of Building ſo much in this Place.</p>
            <p>From hence, when we come oppoſite to <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi> we paſs another Creek, being the Mouth of the River <hi>Alre,</hi> which comes down from <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and is both very broad and deep; and the Ferry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having a very ſorry Boat, we found it danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough paſſing it. On the oppoſite Bank ſtands the antient Town of <hi>Southampton,</hi> on the other Side of which comes down another large River, called the <hi>Teſt,</hi> entring <hi>Southampton</hi> Water by <hi>Red-bridge</hi>; ſo that the Town of <hi>Southampton</hi> ſtands upon a Point running out into the Sea, between Two very fine Rivers, both navigable for ſome Way up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0141100401:207"/>
and particularly uſeful for the bringing down Timber out of one of the beſt wooded Counties in <hi>Britain</hi>; for the River on the Weſt-ſide of the Town comes by the Edge of <hi>New-foreſt:</hi> here we ſaw a prodigious Quantity of Timber, of an uncommon Size, vaſtly large, lying on the Shore of the River, for above Two Miles in Length, which they told us was brought thither from the Foreſt, and left there to be fetch'd by the Builders at <hi>Portſmouth-dock,</hi> as they had Occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>In riding over the South Part of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> I made this Obſervation, That notwithſtanding the very great Conſumption of Timber ſince the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by Building or Rebuilding almoſt the whole Navy; and notwithſtanding ſo many of the King's Ships were built hereabouts, beſides abundance of large Merchant-ſhips, which were about that time built at <hi>Southampton,</hi> at <hi>Red-bridge,</hi> and at <hi>Buſſelton, &amp;c.</hi> yet I ſaw the Gentlemens Eſtates, within Six, Eight, or Ten Miles of <hi>Southampton,</hi> ſo over-grown with Wood, and their Woods ſo full of large well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Timber, that it ſeem'd as if they wanted Sale for it, and that it was of little Worth to them. In one Eſtate at <hi>Hurſeley</hi> in particular near <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> formerly belonging to Mr. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> tho' the whole Eſtate was not above 800<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> in Rent, they might have cut Twenty thouſand Pounds worth of Timber down, and yet have left the Woods in a thriving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; in another Eſtate between that and <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> of about 1000<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> they told me they could fell a Thouſand Pounds a Year in good large Timber fit for Building, for Twenty Years together, and do the Woods no Harm. The late Colonel <hi>Norton</hi> alſo, whoſe Seat at <hi>Southwick</hi> was within Six Miles of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and within Three of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-carriage, had, as I was told, at that time, an immenſe Quantity of Timber upon it, ſome growing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0141100401:208"/>
within Sight of the very Docks in <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weſt it is all the ſame, and as I rode thro' <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſt,</hi> I ſaw the antient Oaks of many hundred Years ſtanding, grown white with Age, and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their wither'd Tops in the Air.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give other Hints of the like, when I come to ſpeak of <hi>Hertfordſhire, Buckinghamſhire, Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and the Counties which we call Inland, where the Timber is but of ſmall Value, for want of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-carriage to bring it away; likewiſe again of the Counties Northward, bordering upon the <hi>Humber,</hi> and upon all the Northern Rivers, not to ſay a Word of <hi>Ireland</hi>; which is ſtill a Store-houſe of Timber, more inexhauſtible, if poſſible, than <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But having mention'd the late Col. <hi>Norton,</hi> we cannot paſs over in Silence his extraordinary Will, which made ſo much Noiſe in the World.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman dy'd in <hi>Dec.</hi> 1732, and left his Real Eſtate of about 6000<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, ſaid to be to the Value of 60,000<hi>l.</hi> to the
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Poor, Hungry, and Thirſty, Naked and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Sick and Wounded, and Priſoners, to the End of the World."</q>
And appointed the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to be his Executors; and in caſe of their Refuſal, the Biſhops; and left his Pictures, and other Valuables to the King. But his Will has been ſince ſet aſide on the ſcore of Inſanity, ſtrong Marks of which it carry'd in the Face of it.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman was famous for acting ſeveral Parts in Plays with great Propriety, particularly the Part of <hi>Falſtaff</hi> in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s <hi>Henry the Fourth,</hi> and the <hi>Merry Wives of Windſor,</hi> at a neat Theatre erected by himſelf, at his Houſe at <hi>Southwick,</hi> to which, in a Vacation, he often drew down and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd the moſt celebrated <hi>London</hi> Actors.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman's Seat at <hi>Southwick</hi> was formerly an old Monaſtery, and many of the Walls of it are yet remaining; the Houſe being a Part of it: the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0141100401:209"/>
is very low and wet, having a great deal of boggy Ground about it; but from the Houſe the Park riſes to the higheſt Point of <hi>Portſdown,</hi> mention'd above, where there are two very large Clumps of <hi>Scots</hi> Fir-trees, which were planted by the late Col. <hi>Norton,</hi> and have thriven ſo well (tho' greatly expoſed to the Sea Winds) as to become a Land-mark at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Diſtance at Sea, and may be ſeen near Twenty Miles at Land. Between theſe two Clumps of Trees, I was informed, that Gentleman intended to have erected a lofty Building; which muſt have had an exceeding good Effect: for from the level Ground on this Spot, you have a full View of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Town, Harbour and Docks, under the Eye; and <hi>St. Helen</hi>'s in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> is another Point of View, with an unbounded Proſpect of the Sea to the South-eaſt; and on the Land-ſide, a large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Vale, well planted and cultivated, bounded with Hills ſpread with Woods, and the <hi>South downs</hi> covered with Sheep, juſt under the Eye; ſo that this Proſpect may be juſtly eſteemed one of the fineſt in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Southampton</hi> is a truly antient Town, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been many Years decaying in its Trade, of late has very much improv'd in that of <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines, which are imported here and ſent into many Places inland, where formerly the <hi>London</hi> Merchants uſed to deal; and that in great meaſure owing to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being eaſier at <hi>Southampton</hi> than at <hi>London.</hi> They alſo carry on ſome Trade with the Iſles of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey</hi>; and not a little, as their Enemies ſay, of the Smuggling Trade. The Town is large and populous, has a fair High-ſtreet, a ſpacious Key; and, if its Trade ſhould thoroughly revive, is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Numbers of People. There is a <hi>French</hi> Church, and no inconſiderable Congregation belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. Here are ſtill ſome Merchants who trade to <hi>Newfoundland</hi> for Fiſh, which they carry to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0141100401:210"/>
the <hi>Streights,</hi> &amp;c. and ſome Ship-building alſo is carried on here, tho' not near ſo much as formerly.</p>
            <p>This Town had formerly the ſole Privilege from the Crown of importing Wines from thence; which, tho' a vaſt Advantage to it, the Corporation either wantonly or corruptly ſold to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Situation of <hi>Southampton</hi> between two Rivers was to its Advantage formerly, in point of Strength; and is beſides ſtrongly wall'd with very large Stones, full of thoſe little white Shells, like Honey-combs, which grow upon the Back of Oyſters. This is a ſort of Stone extremely hard, and ſeems to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd near the Beach of the Sea. Theſe Walls have many Lunets and Towers, in ſome Places double ditch'd; but the Sea encompaſſes near half the Town. It was built in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III.</p>
            <p>I obſerve they have a Method of breaking the Force of the Waves here, by laying a Bank of <hi>Sea-ore,</hi> as they call it. It is compoſed of long, ſlender and ſtrong Filaments, like pill'd Hemp, very tough and durable; I ſuppoſe thrown up by the Sea: and this performs its Work better than Walls of Stone, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cliff.</p>
            <p>At the South-eaſt Corner, near the Quay, is a Fort with ſome Guns upon it, call'd the <hi>Tower.</hi> On one was an Inſcription, denoting its being erected by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in the Year 1542. In the North-weſt Corner was a ſtrong Caſtle, with a Mount, wall'd about at-top as a Keep: upon this a round Stone Tower, with a winding Aſcent.</p>
            <p>The Main of this Town conſiſts of one broad Street, running thro' its Length. There are many old religious Ruins, and great Ware-houſes, Cellars, Store-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The old <hi>Roman</hi> City call'd <hi>Trau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantum,</hi> ſtood more Eaſtward upon the Banks of the River <hi>Itching,</hi> coming from <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where now is a Hamlet nam'd <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s. There is a handſome new Church built upon the Ruins of an old one,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0141100401:211"/>
which, they ſay, was burnt in ſome <hi>French</hi> Wars. It is near the preſent Ferry, and oppoſite to <hi>Bittern,</hi> where was an old <hi>Roman</hi> Caſtle, ſurrounded with a Ditch, into which the Sea-water flow'd. It was ruin'd in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Wars, and <hi>Southampton</hi> aroſe from its Aſhes. This Place is memorable for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of King <hi>Canute,</hi> who to ſilence the vain Flattery of his Courtiers, ſeated himſelf on the Banks of the River, with all his Regal Apparatus, and commanded the Tide not to approach his Footſtool.</p>
            <p>About a Mile from this Town, on the Banks of the River <hi>Itching,</hi> is a vaſt large Pile of Earth, which riſes in the Form of a Cone, from a large wide Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of great Extent and Circumference, which they call <hi>Bevis-Mount.</hi> It is ſuppoſed to be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fortification, thrown up by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Bevis,</hi> to oppoſe the Paſſage of the <hi>Danes</hi> over the River, who lay encamp'd on the other Side. The River is not very large, but the Tide running up into it a good Way beyond the Town, forms a kind of Bay juſt under this great Mount, which being contiguous to an Eſtate belonging to the late Earl of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> his Lordſhip purchaſed it, and converted it into a kind of Wilderneſs; and as it is full of Trees and Brambles, he has cut through them divers circular Walks and Labyrinths, ſo very intricate, that it is hardly poſſible to avoid being loſt in them. His Lordſhip uſed frequently to divert himſelf by dropping his Friends in the midſt of this Wilderneſs, and, ſtealing away, let them wander up and down, till they found their Way out of it. The Mount terminates above, as is feign'd of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> in a kind of Fork; and between the two Spires is a Bowling-green or Parterre, adorn'd with fine <hi>Italian</hi> Marble Statues, brought by his Lordſhip from abroad. It lies open on the Side-facing the River, and when the Tide is in, gives a moſt agreeable Proſpect. On one Side of this Parterre, declining gradually from the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0141100401:212"/>
Top of one of the Spires to the Green, is planted a little Vineyard, expoſed to the South; and on the other Side, on the very Summit of the Spire, ſtands a fine Summer-houſe, very elegantly built and contrived, with a good Cellar under it, where his Lordſhip kept his Wines, having no good Cellerage at his Houſe, which is near a quarter of a Mile from the Mount, from which his Lordſhip called it <hi>Bevis-Mount.</hi> He intended to rebuild the Houſe, and convert all the Grounds lying between it and the Mount, into Gardens, had he lived a little longer. The Beauty of the Improvements which his Lordſhip has made in this Mount, are hardly to be conceived. He has adorn'd it with Statues, Grottoes and Alcoves, and diverſify'd it up and down with ſomething new and ſurpriſing, at every turn, peculiar to his own fine Taſte and Genius in Gardening, wherein no Nobleman excell'd, and few equall'd him in <hi>Europe.</hi> He left this little Seat, and Lands about it, to his Lady, who now enjoys them.</p>
            <p>There are as many things fabled here of <hi>Bevis,</hi> as there are in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> both of whom have ſuffer'd much from Legendary Writers and Tradition; for as King <hi>Arthur</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd many brave and valiant Acts in War, and was of great bodily Strength, ſo <hi>Bevis,</hi> who was a <hi>Saxon</hi> Lord, was a Man of much military Courage and Conduct, as well as perſonally ſtrong. He was a great Oppoſer of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and followed them down to <hi>Wales,</hi> and gave them Battle, near <hi>Caerdiff,</hi> in <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> but was there defeated. 'Tis ſaid his Sword may be ſtill ſeen at <hi>Arundel</hi> Caſtle; yet there are ſome who, from the Fables, with which their Stories are mingled, doubt whether ever there were ſuch Perſons as either of them.</p>
            <p>I here took a Paſſage over to the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and in Two Hours arriv'd at <hi>Cowes,</hi> by the Way paſſing by <hi>Calſhot</hi> Caſtle, where ſome Years ago were to be

            <p>
               <hi>Cowes</hi> is the chief Sea-port Town in this Iſland; and in Time of War the general Place of Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous for Merchant-ſhips waiting for Convoys, being ſecur'd, in ſome meaſure, by the Guns of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, but more by the Neighbourhood of <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> We walked Four Miles, and came to</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newport,</hi> the principal Town in the Iſland; large and populous. At a pretty ſtrong Caſtle, about a Mile diſtant, reſides the Governor.</p>
            <p>The Iſland is very pleaſant, and ſo fruitful, that one Year's Crop will ſerve the Inhabitants for Seven Years; who therefore ſupply <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and the Parts adjacent, with the Surplus. It abounds par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in Corn, Cattle, Hares, Rabbets, Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl, Fiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is Sixty Miles in Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: its Militia is the beſt diſciplined in <hi>England.</hi> Its Wool, in Fineneſs, is next to that of <hi>Cotſwold. Cariſbrook</hi> Caſtle is famous for being the Place of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>Sanham,</hi> in this Iſland, has alſo a Caſtle; ſo has <hi>South-Yarmouth,</hi> ſo called, to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> in <hi>Norfolk. Spithead</hi> between <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and this Iſland, and <hi>St. Helen</hi>'s, near to the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> are famous for the Rendezvous of the Royal Navy of <hi>England.

            <p>This Iſland is alſo noted for having been once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Title of a Kingdom, by King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> VI. in behalf of <hi>Henry Beauchamp,</hi> Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> his great Favourite, who was crown'd King of <hi>Wight,</hi> and of the Iſles of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey,</hi> in 1445, but dying Two Years after, the Iſle loſt the Title of a Kingdom. For King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. who ſucceeded <hi>Henry,</hi> beſtow'd this Iſland upon his Father-in-law, <hi>Richard Woodville,</hi> Earl <hi>Rivers,</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0141100401:214"/>

            <p>Returning to <hi>Southampton,</hi> I was at the Extent of my intended Journey Weſt, intending to look no farther this Way for the preſent. I went North-eaſt, leaving <hi>Wincheſter</hi> a little on the Left, and came into the <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Road at <hi>Petersfield,</hi> a Town chiefly noted for good Inns, and ſtanding in the Middle of a Country overgrown with a prodigious Quantity of Oak-timber. From hence we came to <hi>Alton,</hi> and in the Road thither began a little to taſte the Pleaſure of the Weſtern Downs, which reach from <hi>Wincheſter</hi> almoſt to that Place.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Bolton</hi> has Two very noble Seats in this Country, one between <hi>Alton</hi> and <hi>Alresford</hi>; and one at <hi>Baſing,</hi> of which hereafter. <hi>Alton</hi> is a ſmall Market-town, of no Note, neither is there any conſiderable Manufacture in all this Part of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> except a little Drugget and Shalloon-making; otherwiſe the whole Counties of <hi>Kent, Suſſex, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> are not employ'd in any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Woollen Manufacture.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Alton</hi> we came to <hi>Farnham,</hi> a large populous Market-town, the fartheſt that Way in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> from <hi>London</hi>; and, excepting <hi>Hempſtead</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> as we obſerv'd above, the greateſt Corn-market in <hi>England,</hi> particularly for Wheat, of which ſo vaſt a Quantity is brought hither every Market-day, that a Gentleman told me, he once counted 1100 Teams of Horſe, all drawing Waggons, or Carts, loaden with Wheat; every Team of which is ſuppoſed to bring a Load, which is Forty Buſhels, in the whole 44,000 Buſhels; but I do not take upon me to affirm this for Truth of my own Knowledge, tho' I know ſome have thought the Quantity has been much more; but this alſo was, I ſuppoſe, before the People of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>Emſworth</hi> on one Side,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0141100401:215"/>
and <hi>Southampton, Tichfield,</hi> and <hi>Redbridge</hi> on the other, took to the Trade of ſending their Wheat in Meal to <hi>London</hi> by Sea, as I mentioned before.</p>
            <p>The Toll-diſh, ſome Market-days, uſed to amount to above a Load of Wheat; and yet about 100 Years ago, it was ſo ſhort of it, that one <hi>Buſk,</hi> whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty it was, ſold it for Forty Shillings; ſo greatly was this Manufacture increaſed within that Period. But if <hi>Farnham</hi> has been a Loſer by the Method late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen upon by the People of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi> it has made itſelf amends by another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which it has taken to within theſe Twenty Years paſt, and that is Hops, which it has ſo vaſtly improved in, that it may be ſaid to outdo <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Maidſtone,</hi> and any of the Places in <hi>Kent,</hi> moſt noted for that Commodity; and this not only in Quantity, but Goodneſs. In ſhort, all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood about <hi>Farnham</hi> is one general Hop-ground; and to ſhew the Excellency of the Product, <hi>Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Hops now lead the Price at all the Markets in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this Town is a Caſtle built by a Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which has been in a conſtant Succeſſion poſſeſſed by the Biſhops of the Dioceſe ever ſince King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Time to this Day, and is their uſual Place of Reſidence. This Palace is a magnificent Structure, deeply moated, and ſtrongly wall'd, with Towers at proper Diſtances. It ſtands upon the Edge of an Hill, where is a fine Park. One large and broad Street of the Town below-hill fronts the Caſtle. The Main of the reſt of the Town, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a long ſtrait Street, croſſing it at right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. The River went parallel to it on the South.</p>
            <p>About Two Miles from <hi>Farnham,</hi> is <hi>More-park,</hi> formerly the Seat of Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> who, by his Will, ordered his Heart to be put into a China-baſon, and buried under a Sun-dial in his Garden, which was accordingly perform'd. This Houſe is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0141100401:216"/>
ſituated in a Valley, ſurrounded on every Side with Hills, having a running Stream thro' the Gardens, which, with a ſmall Expence, might be made to ſerpent thro' all the adjoining Meadows, in a moſt delightful manner. At about a Quarter of a Mile from the Houſe, is a large Grotto in the Side of a Hill, from whence you may command a Proſpect of the Meadows and Woods which lie below it; and theſe are bounded again by Hills, which makes the whole one of the moſt romantick Places imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Farnham,</hi> that I might take in the whole County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> I took the Coach Road over <hi>Bagſhot-heath,</hi> and that great Foreſt, as it is call'd, of <hi>Windſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bagſhot-heath,</hi> which at preſent is a horrid bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Country, is capable of great Improvement, as may be judg'd by the ſeveral Incloſures on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it, and ſome in the Centre alſo, which from being in the ſame Condition, (as we at preſent ſee the whole Face of the Country thereabouts, very barren, producing nothing but Heath and Whorts) now produces good Corn and Graſs, and in ſome Parts are good Plantations of Trees, which thrive well. On the Edge of this Heath are ſeveral Seats of Noblemen; but thoſe which require Notice are, firſt, the Right Hon. the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>'s, which is a large Incloſure, the Wood-walks and other Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations being upward of Two Miles in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and the Park, which runs on the other Side of the Houſe, is upward of Three Miles. The Plantations in this Incloſure have made good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, which is a Proof, that the Soil thereabout is capable of great Improvement.</p>
            <p>The next Seat is that of the Right Hon. the Earl of <hi>Angleſea,</hi> which is an antient Houſe, ſituated very near the Church, and almoſt ſurrounded with large Trees, ſo that only the Front appears to View.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0141100401:217"/>The Duke of <hi>Roxborough</hi> has alſo a Seat in this Place, where his Grace uſed to reſide a great Part of the Summer and Autumn, for the Pleaſure of Shooting, being very fond of that Sport.</p>
            <p>This Deſert lies extended ſo much, that ſome ſay there is not leſs than 100,000 Acres of this barren Land that lies all together, reaching out every Way in the Three Counties of <hi>Surrey, Hampſhire,</hi> and <hi>Berkſhire</hi>; beſides a great Quantity of Land, almoſt as bad as that between <hi>Godalmin</hi> and <hi>Petersfield,</hi> on the Road to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> including ſome Hills call'd the <hi>Hind-head,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to take notice of a common Miſtake in relation to <hi>Bagſhot</hi> Mutton, ſo much valued by the Gentry, which they ſuppoſe to be fed there, and from the Poorneſs of the Soil, render'd ſmaller than moſt other Mutton in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whereas I am credibly inform'd, that none of the Sheep are fed at <hi>Bagſhot,</hi> being brought from and fed upon <hi>Hampſhire</hi> Downs, and all kill'd by the Butchers of <hi>Bagſhot,</hi> and ſent to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thro' this Deſert, for I can call it no leſs, we come into the great Weſtern Road, leading from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Saliſbury, Exeter,</hi> &amp;c. and paſs the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Stanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bridge of <hi>Stanes,</hi> and <hi>Egham</hi> Cauſeway, which are part of the Highway from <hi>London,</hi> to the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> having been, for ſome time, in a ruinous and dangerous Condition, and the Tolls and Duties laid by an Act paſſed in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and another in that of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> amounting to no more than the clear Sum of 45<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> the Bridgemaſters were obliged to exact at the Ferry there exorbitant Rates for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying Paſſengers over the <hi>Thames,</hi> in order the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſupport the ſaid Bridge and Cauſeway; and yet all proving inſufficient, as well as burdenſome, an Act paſſed in the Seſſion of 1739-40, for the more
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0141100401:218"/>
effectual Maintenance and well-keeping of them both; and will be a great Benefit to Paſſengers, as alſo to the River, and the Towns adjacent; and the Act provides, that in caſe of the Reparation of the Bridge, or any other Accident which ſhall hinder Paſſengers or Carriages going over the Bridge, the Ferry ſhall exact no higher Rate for conveying over ſuch Paſſengers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than are laid for paſſing over the Bridge.</p>
            <p>Here recollecting that I had yet left the Inland Towns of the Two Counties of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and great Part of the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> out of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and that having, as it were, taken a Circuit round the Coaſt only, I had a great many Places worth viewing to give an Account of; I therefore left <hi>Windſor,</hi> on one Side of the River, and <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court</hi> on the other, to be the Subject of another Letter; and reſolv'd to finiſh my preſent Purpoſe in the Order I had begun it, that is to ſay, to take in the whole Country as I came on; that I might make as few Tranſitions as poſſible from one remote Part of <hi>England</hi> to another.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Stanes</hi> therefore I turn'd S. and S. E. to <hi>Chertſey,</hi> another Market-town, and where there is a Bridge over the <hi>Thames:</hi> this Town is noted for the Burial-place of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. whence his Bones were afterwards removed to <hi>Windſor</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> VII. and alſo by its being the Retreat of the incomparable <hi>Cowley,</hi> where he lived diſtant from the Hurries of the Court and Town, intirely taken up in Country Buſineſs, Farming and Huſbandry, for his Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and where he alſo dy'd.</p>
            <p>From this Town, wholly employ'd in Malting, and in Barge Carriages down the River to <hi>London,</hi> I went away South to <hi>Working,</hi> a private Country Market-town, ſo out of the Way, that 'tis very little heard of in <hi>England.</hi> It claims however ſome Honour, from its being once the Reſidence of a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0141100401:219"/>
Royal Branch of the Family of <hi>Plantagenet,</hi> the old Counteſs of <hi>Richmond,</hi> Mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. who made her laſt Retreat here, where the King her Son built, or rather repair'd, an old Royal Houſe, on purpoſe for her Reſidence, and where ſhe ended her Days in Honour and Peace; the former Part of her Life having been much expoſed to Storms and Dangers under the turbulent Reigns of the Two preceding Monarchs.</p>
            <p>From hence we came to <hi>Guilford,</hi> a well known and conſiderable Market-town. Here ſometimes the Aſſizes are held, but always Elections for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Men for the County. The River, which, according to Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> is called the <hi>Wey,</hi> and which falls into the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Oatlands,</hi> is made navigable to this Town, which adds greatly to its Trade; and by this Navigation a very great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Timber is brought down to <hi>London,</hi> not from the Neighbourhood of this Town only, but even from the woody Parts of <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire</hi> above Thirty Miles from it, the Country Carriages bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hither in the Summer by Land. This Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is alſo a great Support to the Corn-market at <hi>Farnham:</hi> for as the Meal-men, and other Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, buy the Corn at that Market, a good deal of it is brought to the Mills on this River; which is not above Seven Miles diſtant, and being firſt ground and dreſs'd, is then ſent down in the Meal by Barges to <hi>London,</hi> at a ſmall Expence.</p>
            <p>Here is a ſmall Remainder of an old Manufacture, in the Clothing-trade; and it extends itſelf to <hi>Godalmin, Haſelmere,</hi> and the Vale Country, on the Side of the <hi>Holmwood,</hi> (of which I ſhall ſpeak on another Occaſion) quite to <hi>Darking.</hi> Theſe Cloths of a middling Price have formerly been in great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but afterwards loſt their Credit for ſome time, till, by the Application and Skill of the Clothiers, of late they revived, whilſt the Clothiers of <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0141100401:220"/>
and <hi>Tenterden</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> whoſe Goods are of the ſame Kind, are almoſt ſunk to nothing, as I have already obſerved.</p>
            <p>This Clothing-trade, however ſmall, is yet very aſſiſting to the Poor of this Part of the Country, where the Lands, as I have noted, are but indifferent, the Inhabitants generally Cottagers, living chiefly by the Commons and Heath Ground thereabouts.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 23d of <hi>April</hi> 1740, the Upper Church at <hi>Guilford</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi> fell down. It was an antient Building, and, not long before, 750<hi>l.</hi> was expended upon it in Repairs; there was Preaching in it on the <hi>Sunday</hi> before, and Workmen were employ'd in taking down the Bells, who providentially had quitted the Spot about a Quarter of an Hour before the Accident happened, ſo that not one Perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any Hurt, tho' great Numbers were Spectators: Three Bells had been taken down, and the other Three fell with the Steeple, which broke the Body of the Church to Pieces, tho' the Steeple received but little Damage by the Fall.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Guilford</hi> the Road to <hi>Farnham</hi> is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; for it runs along Weſt from <hi>Guilford,</hi> upon the Ridge of a high chalky Hill, no wider than the Road itſelf, and the Declivity begins on either hand, at the very Hedge that bounds the Highway, and is very ſteep and high. From this Hill is a Proſpect either way, ſo far, that 'tis ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing; inſomuch that one ſees to the North, or North-weſt, over <hi>Bagſhot-heath,</hi> one way, to the South-eaſt into <hi>Suſſex,</hi> the other way, almoſt to the <hi>South-downs,</hi> and Weſt to an unbounded Length, where the Horizon only reſtrains the Eye. This Hill being all Chalk, a Traveller feels the Effect of it in a hot Summer's Day, when the Reflection of the Sun make the Heat almoſt inſupportable. This Hill reaches from <hi>Guilford</hi> ſo far as within a Mile and a half of <hi>Farnham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0141100401:221"/>The Hill, or rather the Aſcent of it from <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> is called <hi>St. Catharine's-hill</hi>; on the Summit whereof ſtands the Gallows, which is ſo placed, that the Towns-people, from the <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> may ſit at their Shop-doors, and ſee the Criminals executed.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Guilford,</hi> on the Left-hand Side of the Road leading to <hi>Godalmin,</hi> are the Remains of an antient Chapel, ſituated on the Summit of a Hill, ſo as to be ſeen at a conſiderable Diſtance every way. This is called <hi>St. Catharine's</hi> Chapel. The Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials with which this was built, are a ſort of Tile, which when broken, has the Appearance of Iron within; and the Cement which joins theſe Titles, is now ſo hard, as ſcarcely to be penetrated with the ſtrongeſt Inſtrument. The only Remains of this Chapel, are the outſide Walls, which being built with theſe Materials, have reſiſted the Weather, and the common Fate of Things.</p>
            <p>The great Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> lying thro' <hi>Guilford,</hi> it is conſequently a Town very well furniſhed with Inns for Accommodation of Travellers, as is <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almin</hi> alſo, the next Town, within Three Miles of it, noted likewiſe, of late Years, for the Place of Reſidence of the Impoſtor <hi>Mary Tofts,</hi> who ſo long amuſed Stateſmen, Phyſicians, Anatomiſts, and, in ſhort, all Degrees of Men, learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, with her infamous Rabbet-productions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Guilford</hi> lies a Croſs-road, as it may be called, to <hi>London,</hi> not frequented by Coaches or Carriers, or the ordinary Paſſengers to <hi>London,</hi> tho' 'tis by ſome reckoned the neareſt Way, and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Queſtion much the pleaſanter Road, if not the pleaſanteſt in this Part of <hi>England; viz.</hi> From this Town to <hi>Leatherhead,</hi> 10 Miles; from <hi>Leather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> over <hi>Banſtead-downs,</hi> 15 Miles; or, if you pleaſe, by <hi>Epſom,</hi> 17 Miles; which, tho'
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0141100401:222"/>
it is called the fartheſt Way, makes Amends abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly by the Advantage and Pleaſantneſs of the Road.</p>
            <p>In the Road from <hi>Guilford</hi> to <hi>Epſom,</hi> being 15 Miles, you meet with a Town almoſt at every Two Miles End, in or near which is a handſome Seat. The Road is always good, being a very hard Gravel. On the Right-hand of the Road lie the <hi>Downs,</hi> which have conſtantly a great Number of Sheep feeding on them; and on the Left, the Parks, Gardens, and cultivated Fields, belonging to the ſeveral Gentlemen who inhabit thoſe Seats; all which render the Road very pleaſant and agreeable.</p>
            <p>The Seat of the Lord <hi>Onſlow,</hi> which is the firſt on the Road from <hi>Guilford,</hi> is but indifferently ſituated; the Front which faces the Road, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the Wood, ſo that it can be ſeen only in one Point of View; and the Houſe ſtanding very low, does not command any Proſpect from the neighbouring <hi>Downs:</hi> the Avenues to it are very narrow, and the Building, tho' very large, is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in a very bad Taſte.</p>
            <p>On the ſame Road lies an antient Seat, now in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>James Fox,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which tho' an old Building, yet having an open Situation, in Front, toward the <hi>Downs,</hi> is rendered very pleaſant; and the preſent Poſſeſſor, being a Perſon of fine Taſte, is beautifying the Houſe within, and making pleaſant Plantations about it; which will be a great Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Seat.</p>
            <p>Near this Road alſo lies the Seat of the Honourable Sir <hi>Conyers Darcy</hi>; which is ſituated on an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, ſo as to be ſeen many Miles diſtant. The Houſe is a large new Edifice, having a Park behind it, and is pretty well timbered on every Side. I ought not to omit mentioning the Seat of the late <hi>Arthur Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> at <hi>Fetcham,</hi> near <hi>Leatherhead,</hi> now in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Thomas Revel,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> where no
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0141100401:223"/>
Coſt has been ſpared to make a moſt beautiful Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by Nature more delightful by Art.</p>
            <p>Two Miles from <hi>Guilford,</hi> on the Banks of the <hi>Wey,</hi> is a fine Seat, which belonged, when I ſaw it, to the late <hi>Denzil Onſlow,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> called <hi>Pyrford,</hi> and is exceeding pleaſant, eſpecially for the beautiful Intermixture of Wood and Water in the Park, Gardens, and Grounds adjoining; whereby that Gentleman, whoſe Genius lay wonderfully in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Lands, and rendering Things more profitable and pleaſant, brought <hi>Pyrford</hi> to ſuch a Perfection, as to be inferior to very few, if any, of the fineſt Houſes in <hi>Surrey.</hi> Adjoining to the Park is a very convenient and ingenious Decoy, the firſt of the Kind in this Part of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the North-eaſt End of this Range of fine Seats, is <hi>Leatherhead,</hi> a little Thoroughfare-town, with a Stone Bridge over the <hi>Mole,</hi> a River ſo called, from its remarkable Sinking into the Earth, at the Foot of <hi>Box-hill,</hi> near a Village called <hi>Mickleham,</hi> and working its Way under Ground like a Mole, riſing again at or near this Town of <hi>Leatherhead</hi>; where its wandering Streams are united again, and form a pretty large River, as they were before, running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under <hi>Leatherhead</hi> Bridge, and from thence to <hi>Cobham,</hi> and ſo it purſues its Courſe to the <hi>Thames,</hi> which it joins at <hi>Moleſey,</hi> which doubtleſs takes its Name from the River.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take Notice of an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Error, into which all the Writers I have met with have unwarily fallen, on account of this little River hiding itſelf in the Earth, and finding its Way under Ground, from the Foot of <hi>Beechworth,</hi> or <hi>Betſworth-caſtle,</hi> near <hi>Box-hill,</hi> and then riſing again at <hi>Leatherhead,</hi> as above; as if the Water had at once ingulph'd itſelf in a Chaſm of Earth, or ſunk in a Whirlpit. The great <hi>Camden</hi> has not a little contributed to this Error in his Account thereof;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0141100401:224"/>
but as he is in ſome meaſure ſet right by an Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Note in the laſt Edition of his <hi>Britannia,</hi> by the Right Rev. Continuator, I ſhall have the leſs Occaſion to inſiſt upon the Matter; and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refer to them, and only mention what I have myſelf obſerved on this Occaſion, having reſided ſome time in the Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>The Current of the River being much obſtructed by the Interpoſition of <hi>Box-hill,</hi> which, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its free Courſe, forces the Waters to find their Way thro' as well as they can; and in order to this, coming near that Part called the <hi>Stomacher,</hi> the Waters ſink inſenſibly away, leſſening the Stream for near Two Miles, and theſe Chanels they call the <hi>Swallows</hi>; and the whole Ground on the Bank of the River, where it is flat and low, is full of theſe ſubterraneous Paſſages; ſo that if on any ſudden Rain the River ſwells over the Banks, it is obſerved not to go back into the Chanel again when the Flood abates, but to ſink away into the Earth in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, where it ſpreads.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Swallows,</hi> for there are many, and not one called the <hi>Swallow,</hi> as is ſaid in Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>; tho' they diminiſh the Stream much, do not ſo drink it up, as to make it diſappear: but when it croſſes the Roof near <hi>Mickleham,</hi> it runs very ſharp and broad, nor did I ever know it without Water in the drieſt Summer in that Place. On the contrary, I have known it ſo deep, the Waggons and Carriages have not dared to go thro'.</p>
            <p>Below this Place the Hills riſe again on the other Side very high, and particularly on the Ridge, which the Country People call the <hi>Aſhcomb-hills,</hi> and they ſeem to force the River again Weſt; ſo it ſurrounds moſt of the Park formerly belonging to Sir <hi>Richard Studdolph,</hi> and has ſeveral Bridges upon it; and by this time indeed, ſo much of it is ſunk away, that ſometimes the Chanel, tho' full of Water in Pits and Holes,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0141100401:225"/>
cannot be perceived to run; but this muſt be in a very dry Seaſon, and ſtill the Chanel is viſible, where it runs at other times rapidly enough.</p>
            <p>This Part, which has the leaſt Water, continuing about half a Mile, we then perceive the Stream very viſibly to be increaſed; ſo that it takes Vent again, now, in thouſands of little Springs, till, in another half Mile, it is an ample River again, and paſſes in full Streams under <hi>Leatherhead</hi> Bridge, as above.</p>
            <p>A further Proof of the gradual ſinking away of the Water, take as follows: In <hi>October</hi> 1676, there happened a very ſudden haſty Land-flood, which ſwelled the River to a very great Height; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſo high, that at <hi>Beechworth-caſtle,</hi> and at other Gentlemens Seats, near the River, where they had Fiſh-ponds that were fed by the River, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed their Ponds, and carried off all their Fiſh. Sir <hi>Adam Brown</hi> lived then at <hi>Beechworth-caſtle</hi>; and his Son, and the young Gentlemen of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Families, diſturbed at the Loſs of their Fiſh, came all down to <hi>Darking</hi>; where they raiſed a little Troop of the young Fellows and Boys of the Town, and all went together, to that Part of the River which runs by the Foot of the <hi>Stomacher</hi> of <hi>Box-hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a low flat Piece of Meadow-ground, lying cloſe to the River on one Side; juſt oppoſite to which, the Hill, lying alſo cloſe to the River, made up the Bank on the other: this Piece of Ground might contain about Four or Five Acres, and lying hollow in the Middle, like the Shape of a Dripping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, was by the Overflowing of the River ſo full of Water, that the Bank, which lay cloſe to the River, tho' higher than the reſt, was not to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen ſet themſelves to raiſe this Bank, ſo as to ſeparate the Water in the hollow Part of the Field, from that in the River, and then made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it, at the Upper, or Eaſt-end of the Field; ſo that no more Water could run into the Field from
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0141100401:226"/>
any Part of the River. And the Event was, that in about Two Nights and a Day, excluſive of the Time they took in making their Dams, the Water ſunk all away in the Field; and the Fiſh being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, were caught, as it were, in a Trap; and the Purchace fully recompenſed their Labour; for the like Quantity of Fiſh, great and ſmall, I believe, was never taken at once in this Kingdom, out of ſo ſmall a River.</p>
            <p>This Story I mention, as a Demonſtration of the Manner of this River loſing itſelf under Ground, or being <hi>ſwallowed up,</hi> as they call it; for this Field, where the Water ſunk away is juſt at the Place, which Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> calls <hi>Swallow,</hi> near the Village of <hi>Mickleham,</hi> and under the Precipice of the Hill; and yet the Water was Two Nights and a Day ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leiſurely off. And in this manner, and no other, does ſo much of the River as paſſes under Ground, ſink away.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Darking</hi> is eminent for ſeveral little Things worth Obſervation; as, firſt, for the great <hi>Roman</hi> Highway, called <hi>Stoney-ſtreet,</hi> which paſſes thro' the Church-yard of this Town: Secondly, for a little Common or Heath, called the <hi>Cottman Dean,</hi> or the Heath of <hi>Poor Cottages,</hi> (for ſo the Word ſignifies) belonging to the Town; and where their Alms-houſe ſtands, which ſome learned Phyſicians believe to be the beſt Air in <hi>England:</hi> Thirdly, for Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>'s Houſe and Garden, called <hi>Deepden</hi>; which ſtand in a ſmall Valley, environed with ſteep Hills on every Side; the Level-ground about the Houſe was laid out into pleaſant Walks and Gardens, which were planted with a great Variety of Exotick Trees and Plants, and the Hills were planted with Trees on every Side (excepting the South Aſpect) which was planted with Vines; and formerly there has been ſome tolerable good Wine made there, tho' the Hill is ſo ſteep, that it is very difficult to walk up
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0141100401:227"/>
it. At preſent the Gardens and Vineyard are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and many of the Exotick Trees have been deſtroy'd. On the Summit of the Hill, above the Vineyard, is a Summer-houſe, from which, in a clear Day, you may diſcern the Sea over the <hi>South-downs,</hi> near <hi>Arundel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Market of <hi>Darking</hi> is the moſt famous in <hi>England,</hi> for Poultry; and particularly for the fatteſt Geeſe, and the largeſt Capons. They are brought hither from as far as <hi>Horſham</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi>; and 'tis the Buſineſs of all the Country, on that Side, for many Miles, to breed and fatten them up; and ſome are ſo large, as to be little inferior to Turkeys; I have ſeen them ſold for 4<hi>s.</hi> to 4<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> each, and weighing from 4 to 5 or 6 lb. a-piece.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Holy Thurſday,</hi> here is alſo a Fair, chiefly for Lambs, and the greateſt in <hi>England</hi> of that Kind: I have paſſed over the ſo much celebrated Houſe of Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> at <hi>Wotton,</hi> near <hi>Darking,</hi> not that it is not worth Notice; but becauſe ſo many others have ſaid ſo much of it.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Box-hill,</hi> and particularly from this Part of it, is a fair View, in clear Weather, quite over the <hi>Weald</hi> of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> to the <hi>South-downs</hi>; and by the Help of Glaſſes, the Town of <hi>Horſham, Aſhdown</hi> Foreſt, the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Petworth,</hi> and the <hi>South-downs,</hi> as they range between <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmſton</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> may be plainly ſeen; beſides an unbounded Proſpect into <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vale beneath this Hill is, for many Miles Eaſt and Weſt, called the <hi>Holmward,</hi> or <hi>Holmſdale</hi>; in the woody Part of which are often found Out-lying Red Deer; and in the Days of King <hi>James</hi> II. or while he was Duke of <hi>York,</hi> they have hunted the largeſt Stags here that have been ſeen in <hi>England.</hi> The Duke took great Care to have them preſerved for his own Sport; but they have, ſince that, been moſt of them deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0141100401:228"/>This <hi>Holmward</hi> is now chiefly overgrown with Furz; but was famous for producing ſuch Quantities of Strawberries, that they were carried to Market by Horſe-loads.</p>
            <p>It is ſuggeſted, that this Place was in antient Times the Retreat for many Ages of the native <hi>Britons,</hi> whom the <hi>Romans</hi> could never drive out; and, after that, it was the like to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> when the <hi>Danes</hi> haraſſed the Nation, and ravaged the Country where-ever they came. On this Account they retain here in Memory the following Lines:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>This is</hi> Holmeſdale,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Never conquer'd, never ſhall.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Country, tho' wild ſtill, and perhaps having the ſame Countenance now in many Places, as it had a thouſand Years ago; yet in other Places is culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and has Roads paſſable enough in the Summer quite thro' it, on every Side, and the Woods are in a great meaſure cleared off.</p>
            <p>Keeping along the Bottom of theſe Hills, and yet not entering into this Vale, the Country is dry, ſandy or gravelly, and full of Gentlemens Houſes, and good Towns; tho' if we go but a little to the Right-hand South, into the wild Part, 'tis a deep, ſtrong, and, in the wet Seaſon, an unpaſſable Clay.</p>
            <p>In paſſing thro' <hi>Holmeſdale</hi> (upon the Ridge of Mountains which extend from <hi>Kent</hi> to the <hi>Land's-end</hi>) you come to <hi>Wotton,</hi> a ſmall Village, near which is the antient Seat of the <hi>Evelyns,</hi> which is ſituated amongſt Meadows, having pleaſant Streams of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſing thro' them, and the neighbouring Hills covered with Woods, which renders the Situation pleaſant in the Summer-ſeaſon; but the Roads about it being very bad in Winter, it is not ſo convenient an Habitation at that Seaſon.</p>
            <p>Near this Place is ſituated <hi>Lith-hill,</hi> which riſes gradually from hence, for near Three Miles to the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0141100401:229"/>
South; from the Top of which you have a full Proſpect of the whole Counties of <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> Part of <hi>Hampſhire, Berkſhire, Oxfordſhire, Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire, Hertfordſhire, Middleſex, Kent,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi>; the whole Extent of this Proſpect being thought near 200 Miles, and that without the Help of Glaſſes.</p>
            <p>Travelling Eaſt at the Foot of the Hills, we came to <hi>Rygate,</hi> a large Market-town, ſituated in the Valley of <hi>Holmeſdale</hi>; where are ſtill to be ſeen the Ruins of a Caſtle, with a long Vault, and a Room at the End of it; in which 'tis ſaid the Barons who were in Arms againſt King <hi>John,</hi> held their private Meetings.</p>
            <p>Near this alſo are two miſerable Borough Towns, which nevertheleſs ſend each of them Two Members to Parliament, to wit, <hi>Gatton</hi> under the Side of the Hill, almoſt at <hi>Rygate</hi>; and <hi>Bleechingly</hi> more Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Nutfield,</hi> between <hi>Rygate</hi> and <hi>Beechingly,</hi> is another Branch of the Family of <hi>Evelyn,</hi> who have flouriſhed there many Years.</p>
            <p>From hence, croſſing ſtill all the Roads leading from <hi>London</hi> into <hi>Suſſex,</hi> we came again to a Village called <hi>Godſtone,</hi> which lies on the Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Lewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And keeping on Eaſt, we came to <hi>Weſterham,</hi> a neat, handſome, well-built Market-town, the firſt in <hi>Kent</hi> on that Side. The late Earl of <hi>Jerſey</hi> built (or rather finiſhed, for it was begun by a private Gentleman) a very noble Houſe here, called <hi>Squirries,</hi> which is now in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>John Warde,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Son to Sir <hi>John Warde,</hi> who was Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> in the Year 1724. The Houſe ſtands on a ſmall Eminence, regarding the Land in the Front; but on the Back of the Houſe, the Ground riſes very high, and is divided into ſeveral ſteep Slopes, which renders the Situation
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0141100401:230"/>
damp and cold. Near the Houſe are ſome Woods, thro' which the preſent Poſſeſſor has cut ſeveral Ridings; and on the other Side of the Hill, behind the Houſe, ariſe Nine conſiderable Springs, which unite at a ſmall Diſtance; and theſe form the River <hi>Dart,</hi> which runs thro' <hi>Dartford,</hi> and afterwards diſcharges itſelf into the <hi>Thames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Part of the Country, from <hi>Guilford</hi> to this Place, is very agreeably pleaſant, healthy, and fruitful; and is overſpread with good Towns, Gentlemens Houſes, populous Villages, abundance of Fruit, with Hop-grounds and Cherry-orchards, and the Lands well cultivated; but all on the Right-hand, that is to ſay, South, is over-grown with Timber, has abundance of waſte and wild Grounds, and Foreſts, and Woods, with many large Iron-works, at which they caſt Iron-caldrons, Chimney-backs, Furnaces, Retorts, Boiling-pots, Iron Cannon, Bomb-ſhells, Stink-pots, Hand-gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, Cannon-ball, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence going forward Eaſt, we come to <hi>Riverhead,</hi> a Town on the Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Tunbridge</hi>; and then having little to ſpeak of in <hi>Kent,</hi> except ſome petty Market-towns, ſuch as <hi>Wrotham,</hi> commonly called <hi>Rootham, Town-Malling, Cranbrook,</hi> and the like, of which I have taken ſome Notice before; I turned North, and came to <hi>Bromley,</hi> a Market-town, made famous by an Hoſpital, or College, built there by Dr. <hi>John Warner,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> for the Relief of 20 poor Widows of loyal and orthodox Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are allowed each 20<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and a Chaplain 50<hi>l.</hi> and has had many Gifts and Charities beſtowed on it ſince.</p>
            <p>Near this Town we turned away by <hi>Beckenham,</hi> and thro' <hi>Norwood</hi> to <hi>Croyden</hi>; in the Way we ſaw <hi>Dulwich</hi> or <hi>Sydenham-wells,</hi> where great Crouds of the lower Claſs of People throng every Summer from
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0141100401:231"/>
               <hi>London,</hi> to drink the Waters there and at <hi>Stretham</hi>; and the rather, becauſe it lies ſo near <hi>London,</hi> that they can walk to it in the Morning, and return at Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Croydon</hi> has a great Corn-market, but chiefly for Oats and Oatmeal for the Service of <hi>London.</hi> The Town is large, and full of Citizens from <hi>London:</hi> in it is the antient Palace of the Archbiſhops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and ſeveral of them lie buried in the Church here; particularly Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> who not only repaired the Palace, but built and endowed the famous Hoſpital, (which is for a Warden and 28 Men and Women) and the Free-ſchool.</p>
            <p>From hence we paſſed by <hi>Beddington,</hi> where is the Seat or Manſion-houſe of the antient Family of the <hi>Carews.</hi> The Houſe is noble, and the Gardens fine; yet Architects ſay, that the two Wings are too deep for the Body of the Houſe; that they ſhould either have been more aſunder, or not ſo long. The Court before them is extremely fine, as is the Canal in the Park, before the Court, having a River running thro' it; the Gardens take up all the flat Part of the Park, with Viſta's, or Proſpects, for Two or Three Miles. The Orange-trees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and are the only ones in <hi>England</hi> that grow in the natural Ground: they have moving Houſes to ſhelter them in the Winter from the Inclemencies of our Climate, and are loaded with Fruit in the Summer. They have ſtood in the Ground where they now grow, above 100 Years.</p>
            <p>From hence it is but a little Mile to <hi>Caſhalton,</hi> a Country Village ſituate among innumerable Springs of Water, which, all together, form a River in the very Street of the Town, and joining the other Springs, which come from <hi>Croydon</hi> and <hi>Beddington,</hi> make one Stream, called the <hi>Wandell.</hi> This Village, tho' lying among ſuch delightful Springs, is yet upon firm Chalk; and having the <hi>Downs</hi> adjoining, makes
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0141100401:232"/>
the moſt agreeable Spot on this Side of <hi>London,</hi> as is abundantly teſtify'd by its being crouded, as it were, with fine Houſes of the Citizens of <hi>London</hi>; ſome of which are built with ſuch a Profuſion of Expence, that they look rather like Seats of the Nobility, than the Country-houſes of Citizens and Merchants. Mr. <hi>Scawen,</hi> Knight of the Shire for this County, deſign'd a noble Houſe here; but it is not proceeded with. That which once belonged to Sir <hi>John Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi> Sub-governor of the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Company in the fatal Year 1720, was built by Dr. <hi>Ratcliff</hi>; but the Gardens were made by Sir <hi>John.</hi> It was purchaſed by the Right Honourable <hi>Philip</hi> Lord <hi>Hardwick,</hi> Lord High Chancellor of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> by whom it was lately ſold to <hi>William Mitchel</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> who now poſſeſſes it. I cannot dwell on the Deſcription of all the fine Houſes in this and the neighbouring Villages: I ſhall ſpeak of them again in bulk with their Neighbours of <hi>Mitcham, Stretham, Tooting, Clapham,</hi> and others; but I muſt take a Trip here croſs the <hi>Downs</hi> to <hi>Epſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Banſtead-downs</hi> need no Deſcription other than this, that being ſo near <hi>London,</hi> and ſurrounded as they are with pleaſant Villages, the Ground ſmooth, ſoft, level and dry, (even in but a few Hours after Rain) they conſpire to make the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Spot of Ground of that Kind, in all this Part of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About four Miles over thoſe delicious <hi>Downs</hi> bring us to <hi>Epſom,</hi> a well-built, large, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Village, which abounds with fine Houſes, the Retreats principally of the <hi>London</hi> Merchants. It was very much frequented a few Years ago, on account of its Mineral Waters, which iſſue from a riſing Ground nearer <hi>Aſhted</hi> than <hi>Epſom:</hi> but they are now, tho' not impaired in their Virtues, yet pretty much ſo in their Reputation; poſſibly owing, more than any thing elſe, to the Place being too near
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0141100401:233"/>
               <hi>London</hi> for a Journey for the Quality and Gentry; according to the old Saying, <hi>Far-fetch'd and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought is fitteſt for the Ladies.</hi> The Hall, Galleries, and other publick Apartments, are run to Decay; and there remains but one Houſe on the Spot, which is inhabited by a Countryman and his Wife, who carry the Waters in Bottles to the adjacent Places.</p>
            <p>There are a great many fine Seats around this Place, which we have not Room to deſcribe: ſuch as the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi>'s, Lady <hi>Fielding</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Mitchell</hi>'s at <hi>Caſhalton,</hi> juſt mention'd, Mr. <hi>Scawen</hi>'s, and many others; particularly that formerly called <hi>Nonſuch,</hi> which was once a Royal Palace, and finely ſituated. King <hi>Charles</hi> II. gave it to the Ducheſs of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> and ſhe ſold it to my Lord <hi>Berkeley,</hi> who built a fine Seat with the Materials of it, near <hi>Epſom,</hi> called <hi>Durdans. Nonſuch</hi> is now but a Farm-houſe, and <hi>Durdans</hi> is in the Poſſeſſion of the Lord <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Guilford</hi>; but his Royal Highneſs <hi>Frederick</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> has lately taken it for a pleaſurable Retreat, when he is not diſpoſed to go ſo far as <hi>Cliefden</hi> in <hi>Bucks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Epſom,</hi> that I might thoroughly viſit the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> I rode over ſtiff Clays, and thro' very bad Roads, to <hi>Kingſton</hi>; from whence I had a fine View of <hi>Hampton-court,</hi> at a Diſtance; but that I reſerve for another Journey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kingſton</hi> is a good Market-town, remarkable for a Free-ſchool, erected and endowed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; an Alms-houſe built in 1670 by Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Cleaver</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and endowed with Lands of 80<hi>l.</hi> a Year, a Houſe were formerly reſided the great Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Make-king,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Coomb,</hi> which was likewiſe his, but now in the Family of the <hi>Harveys</hi>; from whence the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of certain Springs are ſaid to be conveyed in leaden Pipes under the Road, and the <hi>Thames,</hi> to <hi>Hampton-court,</hi> Three Miles in Length. Several of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0141100401:234"/>
the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings were not only crowned, but had their actual Reſidence here; whence it took its Name of <hi>Kingſtown.</hi> It had once the Privilege of ſending Burgeſſes to Parliament, but now that is loſt.</p>
            <p>From hence turning Southward, on the Road to <hi>Guilford,</hi> we come to <hi>Eſher,</hi> where was formerly a Seat built by Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> to which, during his Miniſtry, he frequently retired for Amuſement. The Gate to this <hi>Gothick</hi> Building remaining, was turned into a Dwelling-houſe, which was lately ſold to the Right Honourable <hi>Henry Pelham,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who has beautified the old Part, and made additional Buildings to it in the ſame <hi>Gothick</hi> Style, and laid out the Grounds about it in ſo elegant a Taſte, as makes it one of the fineſt Seats in the Neighbourhood of <hi>London:</hi> but the Houſe ſtands ſo low, as not to be ſeen until you come very near it; and the River <hi>Mole,</hi> running near the Back of the Houſe, renders it very damp, which greatly diminiſhes the Pleaſure of the Place, tho' there has been no Coſt ſpared to render it elegant.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Eſher,</hi> on the Left-hand of the great Road, lies <hi>Claremont,</hi> which was a ſmall Houſe built under a Hill covered with Wood, by the late Sir <hi>John Vanbrugh,</hi> and purchaſed by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> who has been at a great Expence in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the Gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and has added to the Houſe a great Extent of Buildings, in the ſame Style with the original Houſe; and has alſo built one large Room, in which his Grace entertains Foreign Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and where all the magnificent Dinners which the Duke makes in the Country, are ſerved up. The Houſe is ſituated ſo near the Hill, that the Moiſture iſſuing from thence, occaſions it to be very damp; and the Winds, being reverberated back from the Woods on the Houſe, cauſe moſt of the Chimneys to ſmoke, ſo that this is a bad Habitation
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0141100401:235"/>
in Winter: but as it is the Place to which his Grace uſually retires from publick Buſineſs, whenever his Leiſure will permit, he has not ſpared Expence to render it as agreeable as poſſible; tho', as ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have had the Contrivance of his Gardens and Buildings, there is not any uniform Taſte to be found in either, which is greatly to be regretted, ſince the noble Owner has been ſo much intent on having it worthy of himſelf.</p>
            <p>From hence, turning on the Right towards the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> we paſs <hi>Walton,</hi> and <hi>Weybridge,</hi> where are ſeveral fine Seats; but particularly thoſe of the Earls of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Portmore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe is a noble Terrace-walk, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſo high above the Level of the neighbouring Ground, as to afford a Proſpect of the Country, as alſo a View of the River.</p>
            <p>The other Seat was beautified by the Counteſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> II. Here is a Walk planted with <hi>Acacia</hi> Trees, which at that Time were eſteemed great Curioſities.</p>
            <p>The Country hereabout is very low and flat, ſo that in Winter the Meadows are generally flooded, which renders the Air damp and cold, and the Roads are ſometimes almoſt impaſſable; but in Summer the Meadows afford a good Quantity of Hay, which ſufficiently recompenſes the Owner for the Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Situation.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Weybridge</hi> is a pleaſant ſmall Seat, now in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Philip Southcoat,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> called <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn-farm.</hi> The Houſe is ſituated low, but is not very damp; and has the Advantage of being ſcreen'd from the Violence of ſtrong Winds, by tall Trees in the Neighbourhood. In the Front of the Houſe is a ſmall Iſland, which in Summer is ſtocked with Sheep, who are conſtantly feeding in View of the principal Rooms of the Houſe. The Water ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding this Iſland is conducted in a ſerpentine
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0141100401:236"/>
Form, ſo as to have little Reſemblance to Art. The Fields above the Houſe are kept very neat, being rolled and fed; ſo that there is a fine Carpet of Graſs, the Walks round them being made dry by Gravel, and, on each Side, planted with ſweet Shrubs and Flowers, in a rural manner. At the Upper-part of theſe Fields, is a Spot of Ground laid out in Gardens, which, being too regular, do not ſo well correſpond with the other Parts, which are laid out to anſwer the Name of a Farm, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly: but this Part has ſomething of too much Stiffneſs and Regularity to agree with the reſt.</p>
            <p>From this Spot of Ground is a moſt delightful Proſpect over a large Extent of Meadows bounded by the River <hi>Thames,</hi> which winds in an agreeable manner; and having frequently large Weſt Country Barges floating in it, with their broad Sails, appear as ſo many moving Objects in a Picture, and greatly enliven the Proſpect.</p>
            <p>From hence alſo are ſeen Ten or Twelve Villages, and ſeveral fine Houſes; and <hi>Chertſey</hi> Bridge appears as if it were intended for a principal Object. Indeed the whole Spot may juſtly be deemed one of the ſweeteſt Retirements near <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>Keeping the River now on my Left, as I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on my Right-hand, drawing nearer to <hi>London,</hi> we came to <hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Peterſham,</hi> little Villages; the firſt, famous for a moſt pleaſant Palace of the late Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> cloſe by the River, now poſſeſſed by the Earl of <hi>Dyſert</hi>; a Houſe King <hi>Charles</hi> II. uſed to be frequently at, and was exceedingly pleaſed with. The Avenues of this fine Houſe to the Land-ſide, lead up to the End of the Village of <hi>Peterſham,</hi> where the Wall of <hi>New Park</hi> comes alſo cloſe to the Town, on the other Side; in an Angle of which ſtood a moſt delicious Houſe, built by the late Earl of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer in King <hi>James</hi> II.'s Reign, as alſo in Part of Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0141100401:237"/>
Reign. This fine Houſe was burnt down in the Year 1720, by an accidental Fire, ſo ſudden and furious, that the Family, who were all at home, had ſcarce time to ſave their Lives.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Houſe, tho' ſo exquiſitely finiſhed, ſo beautiful within and without, the greateſt Loſs ſuſtained; the rich Furniture, the curious Collection of Paintings, and the ineſtimable Library of the firſt Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and Author of that moſt excellent <hi>Hiſtory of the Rebellion,</hi> of which the World knows ſo much, were here wholly conſumed; a Loſs irreparable, as the latter contained among other valuable Things, ſeveral Manuſcripts relating to thoſe Times, and to Things tranſacted by himſelf and by the King his Maſter, both at Home and Abroad, beſides other rare and curious Collections made by that noble and learned Author in foreign Countries.</p>
            <p>The Offices eſcaped the Fate the Houſe met with: and on the ſame Spot of Ground, where the Houſe ſtood, the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> Secretary of State, erected another, after the Deſign of the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Burlington</hi>; and when I have ſaid this, I need not ſay it is equally a convenient and elegant Edifice. The Front indeed next the Court, has not a very ſtriking Appearance, being very plain, and the Entrance into the Houſe not greatly to be praiſed: But the South Front next the Garden, tho' very plain, yet is bold and regular. The Apartments next the Garden, which are chiefly deſigned for State, are alſo very elegant, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully finiſhed.</p>
            <p>The Gardens, which before were crouded with Pluntations near the Houſe, are now laid open in Lawns of Graſs; and the Kitchen-garden, which was ſituated on the Eaſt-ſide of the Houſe, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of Sight, and that Ground is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to an open Slope of Graſs, which leads up to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0141100401:238"/>
a Terrace of great Length; from which is a Proſpect of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> the Town of <hi>Twickenham,</hi> and all the beautiful Seats round about that Part of the Country, almoſt to <hi>Kingſton-bridge.</hi> On the other Side of the Terrace, on a riſing Ground, is a large Plantation of Wood; and on the Summit of the Hill is erected a fine Pleaſure-houſe, which commands a Proſpect of the Country every Way, for many Miles; ſo that by Foreigners this View is eſteemed the moſt beautiful of any near <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we came to <hi>Richmond,</hi> lately the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Retreat of his Majeſty and his Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort the Queen, who took great Delight therein to the Time of her Death; and made not only vaſt Improvements and Alterations there, but purchaſed ſeveral fine Houſes on <hi>Kew-green</hi>; as that of Lady <hi>Eyre,</hi> for his Royal Highneſs the Duke; that of Sir <hi>Thomas Abney</hi> for the Princeſſes; and his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Prince <hi>Frederick,</hi> mean while, made conſiderable Improvements in the fine Houſe and Gardens belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly to the Lady <hi>Capell</hi>; while her Majeſty was uſed to divert herſelf at her Royal Dairy-houſe, and in her beautiful Hermitage, <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Cave, and in other charming Improvements, which ſhe made in the Park and Gardens of this delightful Place. All which are ſo well known, that we need not inſiſt upon them.</p>
            <p>The Court, being ſo near, muſt needs have filled <hi>Richmond,</hi> which was before a moſt agreeable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for the firſt and ſecond-rate Gentry, with a great deal of the beſt Company in <hi>England.</hi> And indeed this Town, and the Country all round it, have much increaſed in Buildings lately.</p>
            <p>The Lord Viſcount <hi>Palmerſton,</hi> the worthy Son and Succeſſor to the Honour and Eſtate of the great Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> has a fine Seat and Gardens (hard by) at <hi>Sheen:</hi> The Gardens were finiſhed, as well as contrived, by the great Genius of Sir <hi>William</hi>;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0141100401:239"/>
and as they were his laſt Delight in Life, ſo they were every way ſuited to be ſo, to a Man of his Senſe and Capacity, who knew what kind of Life was beſt fitted to make a Man's laſt Days happy.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſy to deſcribe the Beauty with which the Banks of the <hi>Thames</hi> ſhine on either Side of the River, from hence to <hi>London,</hi> much more than our Anceſtors, even but one Age ago, knew any thing of. If for pleaſant Villages, great Houſes, Palaces, Gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was true in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, according to the Poet, that
<q>
                  <hi>The</hi> Thames <hi>with Royal</hi> Tyber <hi>may compare;</hi>
               </q>
What may be ſaid of it now? when, for One fine Houſe to be ſeen then, there are, for aught I know, an hundred, even as you ſit in a Boat, and paſs up and down the River.</p>
            <p>Firſt, beginning from <hi>Ham-houſe,</hi> as above, <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> Palace ſalutes the Eye, being formerly no more than a Lodge in the Park, but now makes a Royal Figure.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Richmond</hi> to <hi>London</hi> the River Sides abound with Villages, and thoſe Villages ſo full of beautiful Buildings, charming Gardens, and rich Habitations of Gentlemen of Quality, that nothing can equal it; no, not the Country for 20 Miles round <hi>Paris,</hi> tho' that indeed is a kind of Prodigy.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to view theſe Countries from any riſing Ground. and not be raviſhed with the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Proſpect. For Example, Suppoſe you take your View from the little riſing Hills about <hi>Clapham,</hi> if you look to the Eaſt, there you ſee the pleaſant Villages of <hi>Peckham</hi> and <hi>Camberwell,</hi> with ſome of the fineſt Dwellings about <hi>London:</hi> then turning South, we ſee <hi>Loughborough</hi> Houſe near <hi>Kennington</hi>; the Ducheſs of <hi>Bedford</hi>'s at <hi>Stretham</hi>; other fine Seats about <hi>Croydon</hi>; a whole Town of fine Houſes at <hi>Caſhalton</hi>; Sir <hi>Nicolas Carew</hi>'s and others, at
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0141100401:240"/>
               <hi>Beddington</hi>; Sir <hi>Theodore Janſſen</hi>'s, and that lately built by the Ducheſs Dowager of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> at <hi>Wimbleton</hi>; other fine Houſes at <hi>Tooting</hi>; beſides a very great Number in <hi>Clapham</hi> itſelf. On the South-weſt alſo you have Mr. <hi>Harvey</hi>'s at <hi>Coomb,</hi> formerly the Palace of the afore-mentioned <hi>Make-king,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and from him called <hi>Coombnevil</hi>; with all the Villages mentioned above, and the Country adjoining, filled with the Palaces of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry already ſpoken of; looking North, behold, to crown all, a fair Proſpect of the City of <hi>London,</hi> the moſt glorious Sight, without Exception, that the World at preſent can ſhew, or perhaps could ſince the Sacking of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impoſſible in one Journey to deſcribe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally this Part of the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> lying from <hi>Kingſton</hi> to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where I ſet out: that is, including the Villages of <hi>Richmond, Peterſham, Eaſtſheen, Mortlake, Putney, Wandſworth, Barn-elms, Batterſea, Wimbleton, Tooting, Clapham, Camberwell, Peckham</hi> and <hi>Deptford</hi>; and I muſt therefore quit the ample Subject, and come to <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> a Suburb to, rather than a Part of <hi>London:</hi> but of which this may be ſaid with Juſtice, that it would be
<q>
                  <hi>A Royal City, were not</hi> London <hi>by.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To give you a brief Deſcription of <hi>Southwark,</hi> it might be called a long Street, of about Nine Miles in Length, as it is now built on Eaſtward; reaching from <hi>Vaux-hall</hi> to <hi>London-bridge,</hi> and from the Bridge to <hi>Deptford,</hi> and up to <hi>Deptford</hi> Bridge, which parts it from <hi>Greenwich,</hi> all the Way wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and turning as the River does; except only in that Part, which reaches from <hi>Cuckold's-point</hi> to <hi>Deptford,</hi> which winds ſomewhat more than the River.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0141100401:241"/>In the Centre, which is oppoſite to the Bridge, it is thicken'd with Buildings, and may be reckoned near a Mile broad; <hi>viz.</hi> from the Bridge to the End of <hi>Kent-ſtreet</hi> and <hi>Blackman-ſtreet,</hi> and about the <hi>Mint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Borough of <hi>Southwark</hi> is exceeding populous. Take it as it was antiently bounded, it contained Nine Pariſhes; but as it is now extended, and joins with <hi>Deptford,</hi> it contains Eleven large Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing we meet with conſiderable, is at the <hi>Spring-garden,</hi> juſt at the Corner, where the Road turns away to go from <hi>Vaux-hall</hi> Turnpike towards <hi>Newington.</hi> There are the Remains of the Lines caſt up in the Time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which were repaired in the Civil Wars, as a Fortification to this Part of the Town; at the Corner was a very large Baſtion, or Fort, which commanded the Paſs on that Side; and farther on, at the Corner of <hi>St. George's-fields,</hi> by the <hi>Ducking Pond,</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; the Water of what is now called the <hi>Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pond,</hi> ſtill appears to have been the Moat to the Fort; and the Lines are ſtill ſo high, and undemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, that it would be no difficult Matter to repair and perfect them again.</p>
            <p>That this was formerly a <hi>Roman</hi> Camp or Station, is plain, from the many <hi>Roman</hi> Urns and Coins, <hi>Opera Teſſellata,</hi> and other Antiquities, which have been frequently dug up hereabouts. And as there are pretty good Authorities of antient <hi>London</hi> lying on the South-ſide of the <hi>Thames,</hi> it is but a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Conjecture, that theſe Lines were caſt up and fortified, to prevent the Incurſions of the <hi>Britons</hi> into <hi>Kent</hi>; for the Military Way croſſed the River at the <hi>Horſe-ferry</hi> at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Vaux-hall,</hi> then turned round to the <hi>Ducking Pond,</hi> went on to the Wind-mill in <hi>St. George's-fields,</hi> where it croſſed the Road to the End of <hi>Kent-ſtreet</hi>; where there was a very ſtrong
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0141100401:242"/>
Fortification of Stone, the Foundations of which were dug up in the Year 1685; this ran croſs a Garden about a Quarter of a Mile from the Stones-end. In digging up of this Foundation there appeared two antient Pillars of a large Gate; upon each of them had been placed Heads with two Faces curiouſly cut in Stone, one of which was taken up; but the other lying in a Quickſand, from whence the Springs flowed out pretty freely, was rendered more difficult to be taken up; and the Curioſity of the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not very great, they contented themſelves with getting up one of the Heads; which was placed over the Gardener's Door, where it remained for ſeveral Years, until it was known to the Learned Dr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> who purchaſed it, and kept it in his valuable Collection of Curioſities. Theſe Lines were drawn from hence to the <hi>Grange</hi> near <hi>Bermond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey-ſtreet</hi>; where you ſee another Fort ſo plain, and ſo undemoliſhed, (the Graſs now growing over the Works, and tho', on the Baſtion itſelf, there is frequently Corn ſowed) that it is almoſt as viſible as it was when it was firſt thrown down. By the Direction of theſe Lines, it is very manifeſt, that <hi>Southwark</hi> was once well fortified; for theſe Lines ſeem to have been thrown up from the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> quite round to the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Deptford</hi>; which takes in the whole Extent, on the Land; and the <hi>Thames</hi> was a Barrier on the other Side.</p>
            <p>A farther Deſcription of <hi>Southwark</hi> I refer till I come to ſpeak of <hi>London,</hi> as one general Appellation for the Two Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; for all the Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> and all the Buildings and Villages included within the Bills of Mortality, make but one LONDON, in the general Appellation.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I came down from <hi>Kingſton,</hi> in my laſt Circuit, by the South Bank of the <hi>Thames,</hi> on the <hi>Surrey</hi> Side of the River; ſo I go up to <hi>Hampton-court,</hi> now, on the North Bank, and on the <hi>Middleſex</hi> Side; which I mention, becauſe, as the Sides of the Country bordering on the River lie parallel, ſo the Beauty of the Country, the pleaſant Situations, the Splendor of innumerable fine Buildings, Noblemens and Gentlemens Houſes, and Citizens Retreats, are ſo equal a Match to what I had deſcribed on the other Side, that one knows not to which to give the Preference: but as I muſt ſpeak of them again, when I come to write of the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> which I have now purpoſely omitted; I paſs them over here, except the Palace of <hi>Hampton</hi> only, which I mentioned in <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> for the Reaſons above.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0141100401:244"/>
               <hi>Hampton-court</hi> lies on the North Bank of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> about Two ſmall Miles from <hi>Kingſton.</hi> It was built by Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> and fell to the Crown, when the King ſeized his Effects and Eſtate, as did alſo <hi>Whitehall,</hi> another Houſe of the Cardinal's building.</p>
            <p>Whoever knew <hi>Hampton-court</hi> before it was begun to be rebuilt, or alter'd, by the late King <hi>William,</hi> muſt acknowledge, it was a very complete Palace then, and fit for a King; and tho' it might not, according to the modern Method of Building, or of Gardening, paſs for a Thing exquiſitely fine, yet it ſhewed a Situation exceedingly capable of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of being made one of the moſt delightful Palaces in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This her Majeſty Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was ſo ſenſible of, that while the King had ordered the pulling down the old Apartments, and building them up in that moſt beautiful Form, which we ſee them now appear in, her Majeſty, impatient of enjoying ſo agreeable a Retreat, fixed upon a Building formerly made uſe of chiefly for landing from the River, and therefore called the <hi>Water Gallery</hi>; here ſhe ordered all the little, neat, curious Things to be done, which ſuited her own Conveniency, and made it the pleaſanteſt little Place within Doors, that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be made; tho' its Situation would not allow it to ſtand after the great Building was finiſhed.</p>
            <p>The Queen had here her Gallery of Beauties, being the Pictures, at full Length, of the principal Ladies in her Retinue. Her Majeſty's Apartments for her private Retreat only, were exquiſitely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and there were among the Furniture ſeveral curious Pieces of her own Work.</p>
            <p>The Ground on the South-weſt Side of the Building, has received many Alterations ſince the pulling down of the Water-gallery (which ſtood before this handſome Front of the Houſe, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0141100401:245"/>
the Proſpect of it from the River). This Spot was then laid out into ſmall Incloſures, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with tall Hedges, to break the Violence of the Winds, and render them proper for the Reception of ſuch Exotick Plants in Summer, as were removed out of the Conſervatories during that Seaſon. In each of theſe Places is contrived a Baſon, which is conſtantly ſupplied with Water for the Support of theſe Plants in dry Weather; and as theſe are ſituated near the great Apartments, moſt of the Plants may be viewed from the Windows: and the lower Part of the Houſe, under the great Apartments, being contrived for a Greenhouſe, the Plants need not be carried far, when they are removed out or into the Conſervatory, which was very properly contrived by the Deſigners.</p>
            <p>At the Weſt-end of this Spot was a large Hot-houſe, for the maintaining ſuch tender Exotick Plants, as require a large Share of Warmth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them in this Climate. Of all theſe Parts of Gardening Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was ſo very fond, that ſhe allowed a handſome Salary to Dr. <hi>Plukenet,</hi> a very learned Botaniſt, for overlooking and regiſtering the curious Collection of Plants, which were then in that Garden; but, ſince the Death of that Queen, theſe Things have been ſo much neglected, that very few of the moſt curious Plants are now in Being there, which is much to be lamented; for, however the Taſte for this Part of Gardening may have with Reaſon been neglected by private Perſons, yet, ſurely, at a Royal Palace, all theſe Things ſhould be kept up in the utmoſt Magnificence, as an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Ingenuity, and for the Honour of the Kingdom. This Taſte was, by <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. of <hi>France,</hi> carried to a very great Height; and had the Perſons employed by that Prince been ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Conſtruction of theſe Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, as many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are at this Day, we
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0141100401:246"/>
might have expected, in his Royal Gardens, to have ſeen moſt of the curious Plants in the known Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Here ſtand advanced, on Two Pedeſtals of Stone, Two Marble Vaſes, or Flower-pots, of exquiſite Workmanſhip; the one done by an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and the other by a <hi>German.</hi> 'Tis hard to ſay which is the beſt Performance, tho' the doing of it was a kind of Trial of Skill between them; but it gives us room, without any Partiality, to ſay they were both Maſters of their Art.</p>
            <p>The Parterre on that Side deſcends from the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race-walk by Steps, and on the Left a Terrace goes down to the Water-ſide, overlooking the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on the Eaſtward Front, and affords a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Proſpect.</p>
            <p>This Part of the Garden was at firſt laid out in a Parterre of Scroll-work in Box, which was not only very coſtly at firſt making, but was alſo very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive in keeping conſtantly clipped; which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ill Scent, which frequently reached to the Royal Apartments, occaſioned its being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, and the Ground diſpoſed into another Form. And if at the ſame time all the ſhorn ever-green Trees had been thrown out, and a finer Diſpoſition made of the Ground, it would have much better correſponded with the noble Apartments which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look it, than it does at preſent.</p>
            <p>On the North Side of the Houſe, where the Chapel, and ſome Part of the old Buildings, required to be covered from View, the Ground was laid out in a Wilderneſs, with a Labyrinth ſurrounded by high Eſpalier Hedges; and this was, at that time, thought one of the fineſt diſpoſed Parts of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But as the whole Contrivance of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations is in regular ſtrait Walks, bounded on each Side by tall clipped Hedges, which divide the whole Ground into angular Quarters, to every Perſon of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0141100401:247"/>
Taſte it muſt be very far from affording any Pleaſure, ſince nothing can be more diſagreeable than to be immured between Hedges, ſo as to have the Eye confined to a ſtrait Walk, and the Beauty of the Trees growing in the Quarters, intirely ſecluded from the Eye. And at the ſame time as you are walking in this unmeaning Plantation, you are denied the Benefit of Shade, by being confined to theſe regular Walks, where it would be deemed an unpardonable Fault, to ſuffer the neighbouring Trees to diffuſe their Branches over theſe ſhorn Hedges; ſo that, in the midſt of a Wood, a Perſon may faint for Shade in a ſultry Day, the Air being excluded from theſe Walks by the taller Trees in the Quarters; and pent up Air is much more troubleſome in hot Weather, than the Heat of the Sun in the moſt open expoſed Plain.</p>
            <p>As this Wilderneſs lies oppoſite to <hi>Buſhy-park,</hi> ſo there was deſigned a grand Entrance thro' it to the Palace, fronting the Gates of the Park; where Two large Pillars were erected, to ſupport a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Iron Gate, which was deſigned to have been put up there; but how it came to be left unfiniſhed, and the pitiful low Gates (which by no means cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with the Pillars) put in the Place, I could never learn.</p>
            <p>The Houſe itſelf is every way anſwerable on the Outſide to the beautiful Proſpect, and the Two Fronts are the largeſt, and, beyond Compariſon, the fineſt of the kind in <hi>England.</hi> The great Stairs go up from the ſecond Court of the Palace on the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and lead you to the South Proſpect.</p>
            <p>King <hi>William</hi> brought into <hi>England,</hi> and placed here in a Gallery, built purpoſely for them, the famous <hi>Cartoons,</hi> as they are called, which are Five Pieces of ſuch Paintings, as are not to be match'd in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> It is reported, but with what Truth, I know not, that the late <hi>French</hi> King offer'd 100,000 <hi>Louis</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0141100401:248"/>
               <hi>d'Ors</hi> for theſe Pictures. The King brought a great many other fine Pieces to <hi>England,</hi> and from him the Love of fine Paintings ſo univerſally ſpread itſelf among the Nobility and Perſons of Figure all over the Kingdom, that it is incredible what Collections have been made by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen ſince that Time; and how all <hi>Europe</hi> has been romaged, as we may ſay, for Pictures to bring over hither, where, for Twenty Years together, they brought in vaſt Profit to ſuch as collected them for Sale. But the Rates are abated ſince, and we are now glutted with the Copies and Frauds of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Painters, who have impoſed groſly upon us.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> lived not to ſee this Palace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely finiſh'd; and, 'tis ſaid, King <hi>William</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to have made it more capacious and noble, had he lived.</p>
            <p>After the Death of King <hi>William, Hampton-Court</hi> ſeem'd in a manner neglected. It is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation made by ſome, that <hi>Hampton Court</hi> has, ever ſince the Time of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by every alternate Prince; King <hi>Charles</hi> I. delighting in Country Retirements, took great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure here, and, had he liv'd, had purpoſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it conſiderably; but it became at laſt one of his Priſons.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> II. may well be ſaid to have a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the Place, for the Treatment his Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther met with there; and particularly as <hi>Cromwell</hi> afterwards made it his Summer Reſidence. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore choſe <hi>Windſor,</hi> and beſtow'd a vaſt Sum in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the Caſtle there, which brought it to the Perfection we ſee it in at this Day, ſome few Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations excepted, made in the Time of King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> took but little Delight in retired Palaces, his Bent and Taſte inclining another way.

But King <hi>William</hi> fix'd upon <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and improv'd it as before-mention'd.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Anne</hi> being taken up for one Part of her Reign, in her kind Regards to the Prince her Spouſe, was obliged to conſult his Health, and reſide where that confin'd him, which for the moſt part was at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> where he died; but her Majeſty always diſcover'd her Delight for <hi>Windſor,</hi> where ſhe choſe the little Houſe, as 'twas call'd, oppoſite to the Caſtle, and frequently took the Air in her Chaiſe in the Parks and Foreſt.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of King <hi>George</hi> I. <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> came into Requeſt again.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> I directed my Courſe for a Journey into the South-weſt Part of <hi>England</hi>; and, to take up my Beginning where I concluded my laſt, I croſs'd to <hi>Chertſey</hi> on the <hi>Thames,</hi> a Town I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd before; from whence croſſing the <hi>Black De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart</hi> of <hi>Bagſhot,</hi> I took in my Way to <hi>Hampſhire, Ockingham</hi> in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> lying on the Skirts of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Foreſt</hi>: it is a pretty large Town, and has a well-frequented Market, and a good Market-houſe in the Middle. It is govern'd by an Alderman, Recorder and Burgeſſes, has a Free-ſchool, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an Hoſpital, with a Chaplain belonging to it. It carries on a good Trade in Silk Stockens and Cloth.</p>
            <p>From hence I fell down towards <hi>Baſingſtoke,</hi> which is ſituate in the midſt of Woods, and rich fertile Paſtures: the Country round about is ſpread with the Houſes of the Nobility and Gentry. A little before we came to the Town, we paſs'd by a Houſe built out of the Ruins, and on the Scite of <hi>Old Baſing-houſe,</hi> a famous Fortreſs in the Time of the Civil Wars, belonging to the then Marquis of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Anceſtor of the Duke of <hi>Bolton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0141100401:250"/>This Houſe, gariſon'd by a reſolute Band of old Soldiers, under the Command of the Marquis, was a great Curb to the Parliament Party throughout that whole War; till, after a vigorous Defence, it was taken, and the brave Marquis in it, by <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> who, in Revenge for the obſtinate Reſiſtance it made, put almoſt all the Gariſon to the Sword, and burnt down the noble Fabrick to the Ground, which he ſaid was fitter for the Reſidence of an Emperor than a Subject. The preſent Houſe is in no wiſe equal to the Magnificence which Fame gives to the antient Houſe; whoſe Strength of Building was ſuch as to reſiſt the Battery of Cannon in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Attacks. 'Tis incredible what Booty the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Place pick'd up, lying, as they did, juſt on the great Weſtern Road, where they intercepted the Carriers, plunder'd the Waggons, and ſuffer'd nothing to paſs; to the great Interruption of the Trade of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſingſtoke</hi> is a Corporation, and a large populous Town: it has a good Market for Corn, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Barley, as there are a great many Maltſters there. Some few Years ago a Manufacture of making Druggets and Shalloons, was ſet up here, and as ſucceſsfully carried on, which employs a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of poor People.</p>
            <p>Near this Town a bloody Battle was fought in 871, between the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Town the great Weſtern Road goes on to <hi>Whitchurch,</hi> a mean Town, which however has a Market, and is govern'd by a Mayor. North-eaſt of which lyes <hi>Kingſclere,</hi> a pleaſant Market-town on the <hi>Oxford</hi> Road from <hi>Baſingſtoke.</hi> It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently famous for having been the Seat of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, and from thence takes its Name.</p>
            <p>But I had like to have forgot the famous <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domia,</hi> or <hi>Silcheſter,</hi> which is ſituated in <hi>Hants,</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0141100401:251"/>
on the Borders of <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> and is famous for its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
            <p>Its Situation is very high, hid with Wood. Many were the <hi>Roman</hi> Roads which met here, tho' now ſcarce any; which is one Reaſon why 'tis ſo little known: another is its want of Inns for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of Travellers; for <hi>Aldermaſton,</hi> a pretty neat Village, beautifully ſituated, which is Three Miles diſtant, is the neareſt Town where Lodging is to be found. The Walls of this City are ſtanding, more or leſs perfect, quite round; perhaps the moſt intire in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, eſpecially the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which is a moſt agreeable Sight. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Flint and Rag-ſtone. There was a broad Ditch quite round, and now almoſt impaſſable, and full of Springs. Here-and-there <hi>Roman</hi> Bricks are left in the Walls. Tho' on the Outſide they are of a conſiderable Height, yet the Ground within is ſo raiſed, as nearly to be equal to the Top, and that quite round cover'd with Oaks, and other Timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, of no mean Bulk. <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> is ſaid to have built it, and ſow'd Corn in the Track of the Walls, as an Omen of their Perpetuity. Now indeed the whole City is arable, and in the Fields <hi>Roman</hi> Bricks, and other Reliques, are ſcatter'd, and Coins daily found. It has only one Farm-houſe and a Church. The Reverend and Learned Mr. <hi>Betham,</hi> late Miniſter of this Place, is buried under the North Wall of the Chancel without-ſide; within is another Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Perſon of Quality. They both were drown'd in <hi>Fleet-ditch.</hi> A Spring riſes from under the Wall of the Church-yard.</p>
            <p>Five hundred Feet without the City, on the North-eaſt Side, is a great Curioſity, which the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar think was a Caſtle, but in reality an Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre, in all reſpects like that of <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi> This
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0141100401:252"/>
noble Antiquity has from Time immemorial been a Yard for Cattle, and a Watering-pond; ſo that it is a Wonder their Trampling has not defaced it much more than it has. My Reſolution being to take in my Way what I had paſs'd by before, I was obliged to go off to the Left-hand, to <hi>Alresford</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alresford</hi> was a flouriſhing Market-town, and tho' it had no great Trade, and very little, if any, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, yet, what is very remarkable, there was no Collection made in the Town for the Poor, nor any low enough to take Alms of the Pariſh.</p>
            <p>But this happy Circumſtance, which ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd <hi>Alresford</hi> from all her Neighbours, was brought to an End in 1710, when, by a ſudden and ſurpriſing Fire, the whole Town, with both the Church and Market-houſe, was reduced to a Heap of Rubbiſh; and, except a few poor Huts at the remoteſt Ends of the Town, not a Houſe left ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Town is ſince very handſomely rebuilt, and the neighbouring Gentlemen contributed largely to the Relief of the People, eſpecially by ſending in Timber towards their Building.</p>
            <p>Here is a very large Pond, or Lake of Water, kept up to a Head by a ſtrong <hi>Battre d'eau,</hi> or Dam, which, 'tis ſaid, was made by the <hi>Romans</hi>; and is part of the great <hi>Roman</hi> Highway, which leads from <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to <hi>Alton,</hi> and, as ſuppoſed, on to <hi>London,</hi> tho' we no-where ſee any Remains of it, except between <hi>Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Alton,</hi> and chiefly between this Town and the laſt mention'd.</p>
            <p>Near this Town, a little North-weſt, the Duke of <hi>Bolton</hi> has another Seat, which tho' not large, is a very handſome beautiful Palace, and the Gardens not only very exact, but very finely ſituate, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Viſta's noble and great, and the Whole very well kept. His Grace has no leſs than Three Seats almoſt within Sight of one another, <hi>viz. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botſtone, Baſing,</hi> and <hi>Hawkwood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0141100401:253"/>From hence at the End of Seven Miles over the <hi>Downs,</hi> we come to the very antient City of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> called in <hi>Britiſh Caer Gwent,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the white Town, from the chalky Hills near it. Not only the great Church, which is ſo famous all over <hi>Europe,</hi> and has been ſo much talk'd of, but even the whole City, has, at a Diſtance, a venerable and antient Face; and yet here are many modern Buildings too, and ſome very handſome; as the College Schools, with the Epiſcopal Palace, built by Biſhop <hi>Morley,</hi> ſince the Civil Wars; the old Palace of the Biſhop having been ruin'd by that known Church-Incendiary, Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and his Crew of Plunderers; who, if my Information is not wrong, deſtroy'd more Monuments of the Dead, and defac'd more Churches, than all the <hi>Round-heads</hi> in <hi>England</hi> beſide.</p>
            <p>This Church, and the Schools alſo, are accurately deſcrib'd by ſeveral Writers, eſpecially by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticon,</hi> where their Antiquity and Original is fully ſet forth: the Outſide of the Church is as plain and coarſe, as if the Founders had abhorr'd Ornaments. There is neither Statue, nor a Niche for a Statue, to be ſeen on all the Outſide, no carv'd Work, no Spires, Towers, Pinacles, Baluſtrades, or any thing but mere Walls, Buttreſſes, Windows, and Quoins, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Support and Order of the Building: it has no Steeple, but a ſhort Tower cover'd flat, as if the Top of it had fallen down, and it had been cover'd in haſte to keep the Rain out, till they had Time to build it up again.</p>
            <p>But the Inſide of the Church has many very good things in it, and worth Obſervation; it was for ſome Ages the Burying-place of many <hi>Engliſh, Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings; whoſe Remains the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Soldiers, in the Civil Wars, threw againſt the painted Glaſs. The Reliques of ſome of theſe, at the Repair of the Church, were collected by Biſhop
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0141100401:254"/>
               <hi>Fox,</hi> and, being put together into Six large wooden Cheſts, lin'd with Lead, were again interr'd at the Foot of the great Wall in the Choir, Three on one Side, and Three on the other; with an Account whoſe Bones are in each Cheſt, viz. <hi>Rufus, Egbert, Adulphus, Edredus, Edmundus, Canutus,</hi> and thoſe of Queen <hi>Emma.</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was here marry'd to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Chair uſed in that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is ſtill preſerv'd. In the Body of the Church is a pretty Croſs of <hi>Gothick</hi> Workmanſhip, but ill repair'd. The Steps aſcending to the Choir make a fine Shew, having the Statues of King <hi>James</hi> I. and his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> in Copper, finely caſt; the firſt on the Right-hand, and the other on the Left, as you go up to the Choir.</p>
            <p>The Choir is ſaid to be the longeſt in <hi>England.</hi> The Ornaments of the Choir are the Effects of the Bounty of ſeveral Biſhops; the fine Altar (the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt in <hi>England</hi> by much) was given by Biſhop <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>; the Roof, and the Coat of Arms of the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings, by Biſhop <hi>Fox</hi>; and the fine Throne for the Biſhop in the Choir, was given by Biſhop <hi>Mew</hi> in his Life-time; and it was well it was; for if he had order'd it by Will, there is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe it had never been done: that Reverend Prelate, notwithſtanding he enjoy'd ſo rich a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, ſcarce leaving Money enough behind him to pay for his Coffin.</p>
            <p>There are a great many Perſons of Rank buried in this Church, beſides the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings mention'd above; particularly, here lies, as they told us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a grey Marble, <hi>Lucius,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King of this Iſland, who dy'd 180 Years after Chriſt; and, as is pretended, founded the Church where the Cathedral now ſtands. There are alſo the Monuments of Biſhop <hi>Fox,</hi> Founder of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> College, <hi>Oxon</hi>; Biſhop <hi>Wainfleet,</hi> Founder of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in the ſame Univerſity; in Regard to whoſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0141100401:255"/>
Memory the ſaid College keep his Monument in neat Repair. He is repreſented lying at length with a Heart in his Hand. The Tomb of <hi>William of Wickham,</hi> the magnificent Founder of this Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, very richly gilt. Juſt under the Altar lies a Son of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> without any Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and behind the Altar, under a very fine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, lies the famous Lord Treaſurer <hi>Weſton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. His Effigies is in Copper Armour, at full Length, with his Head rais'd on Three Cuſhions of the ſame, and is a very magnificent Work. There is alſo a very fine Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Cardinal <hi>Beaufort,</hi> in his Cardinal's Robes and Hat.</p>
            <p>The Monument of Sir <hi>John Cloberry</hi> deſerves Notice more for his Story, than for any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in the Figure. This Gentleman was the Perſon ſolely entruſted with the Secret of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. as the Meſſenger that paſs'd between General <hi>Monk</hi> on one hand, and Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> and others intruſted by King <hi>Cha.</hi> II. on the other; by which Service Sir <hi>John,</hi> then a private Muſqueteer only, raiſed himſelf to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Knight, with the Reward of a good Eſtate from the Bounty of the King.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to ſay a Word or two of the famous <hi>William of Wickham,</hi> who built the Body of the Church.</p>
            <p>He was a Courtier before a Biſhop; and tho' he had no large Share of Learning, he was a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of it: his natural Genius was much beyond his acquired Parts, and his Skill in Politicks beyond his Eccleſiaſtick Knowledge. He is ſaid to have put his Maſter, King <hi>Edward</hi> III. to whom he was Secretary of State, upon the Two great Projects which made his Reign ſo glorious; <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) Upon ſetting up his Claim to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0141100401:256"/>
brought on the War with <hi>France,</hi> in which that Prince was three times victorious in Battle. (2.) Upon inſtituting the Order of the Garter; in which he obtain'd the Honour for the Biſhops of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> to be always Prelates of the Order, as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to the Biſhoprick; and he himſelf was the firſt: the Enſigns of that Honour are join'd with his Epiſcopal Ornaments, in the robing of his Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies on the Monument above.</p>
            <p>To the great Honour of this Biſhop there are other Foundations of his, as much to his Fame as that of this Church, of which I ſhall ſpeak in their Places, but particularly the College in this City, which is a noble Foundation indeed. The Building conſiſts of Two large Courts, in which are the Lodgings for the Maſters and Seventy Scholars, and in the Centre a very noble Chapel; beyond that, in the ſecond Court, are the Schools, with a large Cloiſter beyond them, and ſome Incloſures laid open for the Diverſion of the Scholars. There alſo is a great Hall, where the Scholars dine. In the Chapel Window belonging to the College is good painted Glaſs of Imagery. In the middle of the Cloiſters is the Library, a ſtrong Stone Building, well contriv'd to prevent Fire.</p>
            <p>In digging the Foundation of a Houſe near the College, in a Stone Coffin, was found a Stone ſet in a Gold Ring, with this Inſcription in very odd Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; ſuppoſed to be about the Sixth Century, <hi>Domino Comite fidele meo,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Lord being my Guide and faithful Companion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Over the Door of the School ſtands a very good Statue of the Founder, made by <hi>Cibber,</hi> whoſe Workmanſhip are the two excellent Figures over <hi>Bethlehem-gate,</hi> the Father of that excellent Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian <hi>Colley Cibber,</hi> Poet-Laureat.</p>
            <p>The Scholars have Exhibitions at a certain time of Continuance here, if they pleaſe to ſtudy, in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0141100401:257"/>
the new College at <hi>Oxford,</hi> built by the ſame noble Benefactor.</p>
            <p>The Clergy here live very elegantly in the Cloſe belonging to the Cathedral; where, beſides the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Palace, mentioned above, are very good Houſes, and very handſomely built, for the Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, Canons, and other Dignitaries of this Church: The Deanry is a very pleaſant Dwelling, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens are large, and the River runs thro' them; but the Floods in Winter ſometimes much incommode them.</p>
            <p>This School has fully anſwer'd the End of the Founder, who, tho' he was no great Scholar, reſolv'd to erect a Houſe for making the Ages to come more learned than thoſe that went before; and many learned and great Men have been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated here.</p>
            <p>As the City ſtands in a Vale on the Bank, and at the Conjunction of Two ſmall Rivers, ſo the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try riſing every way, but juſt as the Courſe of the Water keeps the Valley open, you muſt neceſſarily, as you go out of the Gates, go up Hill every way: but when once aſcended, you come to the moſt charming Plains, and moſt pleaſant Country of that Kind in <hi>England</hi>; which continues, with very ſmall Interſections of Rivers and Valleys, for above Fifty Miles, as I ſhall obſerve more particularly in the Sequel of this Journey.</p>
            <p>At the Weſt Gate of this City was antiently a Caſtle, in which, 'tis ſaid, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings kept their Court, which however is doubtful, and muſt be meant of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> only. As to the Tale of King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s round Table, and his Two Dozen of Knights, which Table being one Piece of Wood, ſupported by Marble Pillars, they ſtill ſhew in the Town-hall, ſaid to be Part of the ſaid Caſtle, as a Piece of Antiquity of 1200 Years ſtanding, and has, as they pretend, the Names of the ſaid Knights in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0141100401:258"/>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> Characters, and yet ſuch as no Man can read: all this Story I ſee no Ground to give the leaſt Credit to.</p>
            <p>Where this Caſtle was ſaid to ſtand, the late King <hi>Charles</hi> II. mark'd out a very noble Deſign; which, had he lived, would certainly have made that Part of the Country the Reſort of the Quality and Gentry of all Parts of the Kingdom; for the Country hereabout far exceeds that of <hi>Newmarket-heath,</hi> for all kinds of Sport and Diverſion.</p>
            <p>The Building was ſo far proſecuted, that the Front next the City was carried up to the Roof, and cover'd; but what was further intended was not proceeded on. There was a Street of Houſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned from the Gate of the Palace down to the Town, but it was never begun to be built; the Park mark'd out was exceeding large, near Ten Miles in Circumference, and ended Weſt upon the open Downs, in View of <hi>Stockbridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Houſe, with a Royal Revenue, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſettled by Parliament, as an Appenage upon Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> for his Life, in caſe he had out-liv'd the Queen: but his Royal Highneſs dying before her Majeſty, all Hope of ſeeing this Deſign perfected, or the Houſe finiſh'd, is now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd. And his late Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> I. made a Preſent to the Duke of <hi>Bolton</hi> of the fine Pillars of <hi>Italian</hi> Marble, which were to have ſupported its Stair-caſe.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral other publick Edifices in this City, and in the Neighbourhood, which I have not Room to deſcribe, as the Hoſpitals, and Building adjoining near the Eaſt-gate. Towards the North is a Piece of an old Monaſtery undemoliſh'd, and which is ſtill preſerv'd to the Religion, being the Reſidence of ſome private Roman Catholick Gentlemen, where they have an Oratory, and, as they ſay, live ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of <hi>St. Benedict.</hi> This Building is call'd <hi>Hide-houſe</hi>; and as they live very uſefully,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0141100401:259"/>
and to the higheſt Degree obliging among their Neighbours, they meet with no Obſtruction from any body.</p>
            <p>Beyond the River Eaſtward is a high Hill call'd <hi>St. Giles</hi>'s, from an Hoſpital whoſe Ruins only are now viſible; and a Church-yard ſeeming to have been a Camp, beſides the Marks of Baſtions, and Works of Fortifications in the modern Style. Here <hi>Waltheof,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> was beheaded by Order of King <hi>William</hi> I. whoſe Body was carried to <hi>Crowland,</hi> and ſaid to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wincheſter</hi> is a Place of no Trade, other than is naturally occaſion'd by the Inhabitants of the City, and neighbouring Villages, one with another: here is no Manufacture, no Navigation; there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an Attempt to make the River navigable from <hi>Southampton,</hi> and it was once made practicable; but it never anſwered the Expence, ſo as to give En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Undertakers to keep it up.</p>
            <p>Here is a great deal of good Company; and Abundance of Gentry being in the Neighbourhood, it adds to the Sociableneſs of the Place: the Clergy alſo here, are, generally ſpeaking, rich, and very numerous.</p>
            <p>The magnificent Hoſpital called <hi>Holy-croſs,</hi> on the South of this City, at a Mile's Diſtance on the Road to <hi>Southampton,</hi> is worth Notice: it was founded by Biſhop <hi>Blois.</hi> The Church is in the Form of a Croſs, and has a large ſquare Tower. Every Traveller, that knocks at the Door of this Houſe, in his Way, and aſks for it, claims the Relief of a Piece of white Bread, and a Cup of Beer; and this Donation is ſtill continued. A Quantity of good Beer is ſet apart every Day to be given away; and what is left is diſtributed to other Poor, but none of it kept to next Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0141100401:260"/>How the Revenues of this Hoſpital, which ſhould maintain the Maſter, and Thirty private Gentlemen, whom they call <hi>Fellows,</hi> but ought to call <hi>Brothers,</hi> are now reduced to maintain only Fourteen, while the Maſter lives in a Figure equal to the beſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the County, would be well worth the Inquiry of a proper Viſitor, if ſuch can be nam'd. 'Tis a Thing worthy of Notice, when publick Charities, deſign'd for the Relief of the Poor, are imbezzled by the Rich, and turn'd to the Support of Luxury and Pride.</p>
            <p>An Infirmary is eſtabliſh'd lately in this Town, by voluntary Subſcription, after the laudable Examples of thoſe of <hi>St. James</hi>'s <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>St. George</hi>'s at <hi>Hyde-Park Corner,</hi> and has met with great Succeſs, being principally owing to the Zeal and Pains of the Reverend Doctor <hi>Alured Clarke.</hi> I have not room to ſay all that might be ſaid on this Head, and ſo muſt refer you to the Account given by the Doctor, of the Riſe and Progreſs, Rules and Orders, of this excellent Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>I made an Excurſion from <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to ſee the antient Town of <hi>Romſey,</hi> noted for its delightful Situation, having all round it Woods, Corn-fields, Meadows and Paſtures. The River, and Rivulets, which are many, have a rapid Courſe. The Town was queſtionleſs <hi>Roman,</hi> and its Name declares as much. The Church is a noble Pile of Architecture, arch'd with Stone, in Form of a Croſs, with Semi-circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chapels in the upper Angles. The Churches hereabouts called <hi>Minſters,</hi> as <hi>Wimburn-minſter,</hi> in the neighbouring County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> were built by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, as ſoon as they became Chriſtian. At the Weſt-end is the Piece of an old Wall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably belonging to the Nunnery built here by King <hi>Edgar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0141100401:261"/>Returning to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> we ſtruck up North-weſt and came to <hi>Stokebridge,</hi> a poor ſorry Borough Town, noted for its Corruption in electing Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and being a great Thorough-fare on the South-weſtern Road: it has however a great many good Inns, and as well provided as any on that Road, tho' it has no Market.</p>
            <p>The ingenious Sir <hi>Richard Steele</hi> once repreſented this Town in Parliament; and tho' he was power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oppoſed, yet carried his Election by a Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, which made all the Women of his Side: Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a great Entertainment for the Burgeſſes and their Wives, and after having been very free and facetious among them, he took up a large Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtuck it full of Guineas, and declared it the Prize of that Man, whoſe Wife ſhould be firſt brought to-bed after that Day Nine Months. This occaſioned a great deal of Mirth, and what with the Entertainment, and with the Hopes of getting the Prize, the good Women prevailed on their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to vote for Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> whom they to this Day commemorate; and, as it is ſaid, once made a ſtrong Puſh to get a ſtanding Order of the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, that no Man ſhould be received as a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for that Borough, who did not offer himſelf upon the ſame Terms.</p>
            <p>Still riſing Northward, we arriv'd at <hi>Andover,</hi> a Mayor, Market and Borough Town, and alſo noted for being a great Thorough-fare on the direct <hi>Weſtern</hi> Road, as well from <hi>Newbury</hi> to <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> as from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Taunton,</hi> and all the manufacturing Towns of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> whereby it is greatly inriched, and is a thriving, handſome, well built and populous Town. It is very healthy and pleaſantly ſituated juſt on the Borders of thoſe Downs, which are commonly, tho' not properly called <hi>Saliſbury-plain.</hi> Near this Town is a Village called <hi>Weyhill,</hi> where the open Down Country begins; and here upon theſe Downs
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0141100401:262"/>
is the famous <hi>Weyhill,</hi> where the greateſt Fair for Sheep in the Nation is kept; and principally of Ewes for Store-ſheep for the Farmers of the Counties of <hi>Berks, Oxford, Bucks, Bedford, Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Middleſex, Kent, Surrey</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> who ſend for them to this Place.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Andover</hi> we bent our Way towards <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> by <hi>Quarley-hills,</hi> on the Weſt-ſide of which are the Remains of a great Fortification, conſiſting of two outward Trenches, and other Works of great Strength; and then entering that County, and leaving <hi>Luggerſhall</hi> (a ſmall Hamlet-town, noted only for having been formerly the Caſtle of <hi>Jeoffrey Fitzpiers,</hi> on the North of us, we came to <hi>Ambreſbury,</hi> a very antient Town, pretty large, ſtanding on the River <hi>Avon,</hi> and having ſeveral good Inns, but its Market is much decayed, and almoſt diſcontinued. It is ſaid to have taken its Name from <hi>Ambrius,</hi> who founded here a Monaſtery of <hi>Benedictines,</hi> long before the coming in of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who deſtroyed it, or from <hi>Aurelius Ambroſe,</hi> a <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Prince, who rebuilt it, and fill'd it with 300 Monks, to pray for the Souls of thoſe noble <hi>Britons</hi> who were ſlain by the Treachery of the perfidious <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> who maſſacred here 300 of the antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility, in cold Blood, whom he had invited with their King <hi>Vortigern,</hi> to meet him there without Arms, to treat of a League of Amity, and rejoice together.</p>
            <p>The treacherous <hi>Saxon</hi> ſav'd only the King, whom he obliged to give him near a Third of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Eaſtward, before he would ſet him at Liberty.</p>
            <p>The Monaſtery at <hi>Ambreſbury</hi> was converted into a Nunnery, and <hi>Eleanor,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> III.'s Queen retir'd and dy'd here; whoſe Example induced the Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi>'s ſecond Daughter, and Thirteen Noblemens Daughters, to take the Veil together in this Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0141100401:263"/>The ſtupendous Piece of Antiquity called <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> deſerves our particular Notice; and I ſhall therefore borrow from Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi>'s Piece lately publiſhed, intituled, <hi>Stone-henge, a Temple reſtored to the Britiſh Druids,</hi> the following brief Account and Deſcription of it, referring to that elaborate Performance itſelf (which well deſerves the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Learned and Curious) for a more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Account, and for the Doctor's Reaſons for his Hypotheſis, which we think he has made out with as much Certainty, as the Nature of the Subject will admit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Downs, or <hi>Saliſbury-Plain,</hi> as this Gentleman obſerves, is one of the moſt delightful Spots in <hi>Britain</hi>; and <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> by the extravagant Grandeur of the Work, has attracted the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Ages. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> himſelf ſays of it, That he was grieved, that the Founders of it could not be traced out: but Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> has very happily made it more than probable, that it was a Temple of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Druids, and (the Cathedral, as it may be called) the chief of all their Temples in this Iſland.</p>
            <p>The Stones of which it was compoſed are not factitious; for that would have been a greater Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than to bring them together to the Place where they are; but undoubtedly were brought Fifteen or Sixteen Miles off, prodigious as they are, from thoſe called the Grey Weathers, near <hi>Abury</hi> on <hi>Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> Downs, all the greater Stones, except the Altar, being of that ſort; for that, being deſigned to reſiſt Fire, is of a ſtill harder kind; 'tis a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Cryſtals of red, green, and white Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, cemented by Nature with opaque Granules, of flinty or ſtony Matter. The Stone at the upper End of the Cell, which is fallen down and broken in half, the Doctor tells us, weighs above Forty Tons, and would require above 140 Oxen to draw
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0141100401:264"/>
it, and yet is not the heavieſt Stone neither. Judge then what a ſtupendous Labour it was to bring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo many Miles, ſuch a Number as were uſed here; and this has induced many inconſiderate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to imagine, that the Founders had an Art of making Stone, which has been loſt for ſo many Ages.</p>
            <p>The preſent Name is <hi>Saxon,</hi> tho' the Work is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Compariſon older, ſignifying a hanging Rod or Pole, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Gallows, from the hanging Parts, Architraves, or rather Impoſts; and pendulous Rocks are ſtill in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> called <hi>Henges.</hi> But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Name was moſt probably the <hi>Ambres,</hi> for which our learned Author, to whom we refer, gives very ſatisfactory Reaſons; and hence the adjacent Town of <hi>Ambreſbury,</hi> which I have taken Notice of, has its Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stone-henge</hi> ſtands not upon the Summit of a Hill, but near it, however: at half a Mile Diſtance the Appearance is awful; but as you come up the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, in the North-eaſt of it, which Side is moſt perfect, the Greatneſs of its Contour fills the Eye in an aſtoniſhing manner. It is incloſed in a circular Ditch, which having paſſed, we aſcend Thirty-five Yards before we come at the Work. The Stones are chiſſell'd, and far from rude, tho' not cut to that Preciſeneſs as the Ruins in <hi>Old Rome,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of them had more Pains taken with them then the Outſide; for ſo, as our Author obſerves, the polite Architects of the Eaſtern World were wont to do; not like our <hi>London</hi> Builders, who carve every Moulding, and croud every Ornament they borrow from Books, on the Outſide of the publick Structures, that they may the more commodiouſly gather the Duſt and Smoke.</p>
            <p>When you enter the Building, whether on Foot or Horſeback, and caſt your Eyes around upon the yawning Ruins, you are ſtruck into an ecſtatick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0141100401:265"/>
which no one can deſcribe, and they only can be ſenſible of, who feel it. Other Buildings fall by piece-meal, but here a ſingle Stone is a Ruin. Yet is there as much undemoliſh'd as enables us ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to recover its Form when in its moſt perfect State. When we advance farther, the dark Part of the ponderous Impoſts over our Heads, the Chaſms of Sky between the Jambs of the Cell, the odd Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Whole, and the Greatneſs of every Part, ſurpriſes. If you look upon the perfect Part, you fanſy intire Quarries mounted up into the Air; if upon the rude Havock below, you ſee, as it were, the Bowels of a Mountain turn'd inſide out.</p>
            <p>The whole Work, being of a circular Form, is about 108 Feet in Diameter, from out to out. The Intention of the Founders was this: the whole Circle was to conſiſt of Thirty Stones, each Stone to be <note n="*" place="bottom">This Cubit is the old <hi>Hebrew, Phoenician,</hi> or <hi>Egyptian</hi> Cubit, and what the Founders of <hi>Stone-benge</hi> went by, and amounts to Twenty Inches Four-fifths <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaſure.</note> Four Cubits broad, each Interval Two Cubits; Thirty times Four Cubits is twice Sixty: Thirty times Two Cubits is Sixty; ſo that thrice Sixty Cubits completes a Circle, whoſe Diameter is Sixty. A Stone being Four Cubits broad, and Two thick, is double the Interval, which is a Square of Two Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. Change the Places between the Stones and their Intervals, and it will make a good Ground-plot for a circular Portico of <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Work. Tho' theſe Bodies of Stone, which are in the Nature of Impoſts or Cornices, never had, or were intended to have, any Mouldings upon them, like <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Works, they are wrought perfectly plain, and ſuitable to the Stones that ſupport them; and the Chiſſeling of the upright Stones is only above Ground; for the Four or Five Feet in Length below Ground, is left in the original natural Form. The upright Stones are made very judiciouſly to diminiſh a little
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0141100401:266"/>
every way; ſo that at-top they are but Three Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and a half broad, and ſo much nearer as to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Impoſts to meet a little over the Heads of the Uprights, both within-ſide and without; by which means the Uprights are leſs liable to fall or ſwerve.</p>
            <p>It is to be fear'd ſome indiſcreet People have been digging about the great Entrance, with ridiculous Hopes of finding Treaſure, and ſo have looſen'd the chalky Foundation; for the upper Edge of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt overhangs no leſs than Two Feet Seven Inches, which is very conſiderable in a Height of Eighteen. The whole Breadth at the Foundation is but Two Feet and an half; and this noble Front is now chiefly kept up by the Maſonry of the Mortaiſe, and Tendon of the Impoſts.</p>
            <p>The Contrivance of the Founders in making Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taiſes and Tenons between the upright Stones and the Impoſts, is admirable; but ſo contrary to any Practice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that it alone overſets their Claim to the Work. Theſe Tenons and Mortaifes of this outer Circle are round, and fit one another very aptly. They are Ten Inches and one half in Diameter, and reſemble half an Egg, rather than an Hemiſphere, and ſo effectually keep both Uprights and Impoſts from Luxation, that they muſt have been thrown down with great Difficulty and Labour. The whole Height of Upright and Impoſt is Ten Cubits and an half; the Upright, Nine; the Impoſt over the grand Entrance is in its middle Length Eleven Feet Ten Inches, and ſo is larger than the reſt, and it is alſo a little broader, meaſuring on the Inſide.</p>
            <p>Of the outer Circle of <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> which in its Perfection conſiſted of Sixty Stones, Thirty Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights, and Thirty Impoſts, there are Seventeen Uprights left ſtanding, Eleven of which remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous by the grand Entrance, Five Impoſts upon them. One Upright at the Back of the Temple, leans upon a Stone of the inner Circle. There are
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0141100401:267"/>
Six more lying upon the Ground, whole or in Pieces, ſo that Twenty-four out of Thirty are ſtill viſible at the Place. There is but one Impoſt more in its proper Place, and but Two lying upon the Ground; ſo that Twenty-two are carry'd off. Hence our Author infers, this Temple was not defac'd when Chriſtianity prevailed; but that ſome rude Hands carried the Stones away for other Uſes. So much for the larger Circle of Stones with Impoſts.</p>
            <p>As to the leſſer Circle, which never had any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, it is ſomewhat more than Eight Feet from the Inſide of the outward one, and conſiſts of Forty leſſer Stones, forming, with the outward Circles, as it were, a circular Portico, a moſt beautiful Work, and of a pretty Effect; they are flat Parallelograms, as thoſe of the outer Circle; and their general and deſign'd Proportion is Two Cubits, or Two and an half, as ſuitable Stones were found. They are a Cubit thick, and Four and one half high, which is more than Seven Feet; this was their ſtated Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being every way the half of the upper Uprights. Theſe Stones are of a harder Compoſition than the reſt, as the better to reſiſt Violence, as they are leſſer, and they have ſufficient Faſtenings in the Ground. There are but Nineteen of the Forty left; but Eleven of them are ſtanding <hi>in ſitu,</hi> Five in one Place contiguous, Three in another, Two in another.</p>
            <p>The Walk between theſe Two Circles, which is 300 Feet in Circumference, is very noble, and very delightful.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Adytum,</hi> or Cell, into which we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none but the upper Order of Druids were to enter, is compoſed of certain Compages of Stones, which our Author calls <hi>Trilithons,</hi> becauſe made each of two upright Stones, with an Impoſt at top, and there are manifeſtly Five of theſe remaining; Three of which are intire, Two are ruin'd, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but the Stones remain <hi>in ſitu.</hi> It is a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0141100401:268"/>
Niche Twenty-ſeven Cubits long, and as much broad, meaſuring in the wideſt Place. The Stones that compoſe it, are really ſtupendous; their Height, Breadth, and Thickneſs are enormous, and to ſee ſo many of them placed together in a nice and critical Figure, with Exactneſs; to conſider, as it were, not a Pillar of one Stone, but a whole Wall, a Side, an End of a Temple, of one Stone; to view them curiouſly, create ſuch a Motion in the Mind as Words cannot expreſs. One very remarkable Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the Conſtitution of this <hi>Adytum,</hi> has eſcap'd all Obſervers before our Author, which is this: as this Part is compoſed of Trilithons ſet two and two on each Side, and one right before, they riſe in Height and Beauty of the Stones, from the lower End of the <hi>Adytum</hi> to the upper End. That is, the two hithermoſt Trilithons correſponding, or thoſe next the grand Entrance, on the Right-hand, and on the Left, are exceeded in Height by the Two next in Order; and thoſe are exceeded by that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Altar, in the upper End of this Choir; and their Heights reſpectively are Thirteen Cubits, Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Cubits, Fifteen Cubits.</p>
            <p>The Impoſts of theſe are all of the ſame Height, and Ten Cubits may be ſuppoſed their medium Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Length. The Artifice of the Tenons and Mortaiſes of theſe Trilithons and their Impoſts, what Conformity they bear to that of the outer Circle, is exceedingly pretty, every thing being done very geometrically, and as would beſt anſwer every Purpoſe from plain and ſimple Principles; and 'tis wonderful, that in the Management of ſuch prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Stones as theſe are, fix'd in the Ground, and ramm'd in like Poſts, there is not more Variation in the Height, Diſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe greater Stones of the <hi>Adytum,</hi> as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, there are none wanting, being all on the Spot, Ten Uprights, and Five Cornices. The
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0141100401:269"/>
Trilithon firſt on the Left-hand is intire <hi>in ſitu,</hi> but vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decay'd, eſpecially the Cornice, in which ſuch deep Holes are corroded, that in ſome Places the Daws make their Neſts in them. The next Trilithon on the Left is intire, compoſed of three moſt beautiful Stones. The Cornice, happening to be of a very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Engliſh</hi> Marble, has not been much impair'd by the Weather. Our Author took a Walk on the Top of it, but thought it a frightful Situation. The Trilithon of the upper End was an extraordinary Beauty; but probably, thro' the Indiſcretion of ſome body digging between them and the Altar, the noble Impoſt is diſlodg'd from its airy Seat, and fallen upon the Altar, where its huge Bulk lies unfractur'd. The Two Uprights that ſupported it, are the moſt delicate Stones of the whole Work. They were, our Author thinks, above Thirty Feet long, and well chiſſell'd, finely taper'd and proportion'd in their Dimenſions. That Southward is broken in two, lying upon the Altar. The other ſtill ſtands intire; but leans upon one of the Stones of the inward Oval; the Root-end, or unhewn Part of both, is raiſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above Ground. The Trilithon towards the Weſt is intire, except that ſome of the End of the Impoſt is fallen clean off, and all the upper Edge is very much diminiſh'd by time. The laſt Trilithon, on the Right-hand of the Entrance into the <hi>Adytum,</hi> has ſuffer'd much. The outer Upright, being the Jamb of the Entrance, is ſtill ſtanding; the other Upright and Impoſt are both fallen forwards into the Adytum, and broke each into Three Pieces, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, from digging near it. That which is ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has a Cavity in it, which Two or Three Perſons may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it in warm from the Weather.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stone-henge</hi> is compoſed of Two Circles and Two Ovals, reſpectively concentrick. The Stones that form theſe Ovals riſe in Height as nearer the upper End of the <hi>Adytum</hi>; and their mediate Meaſure is
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0141100401:270"/>
Four Cubits and Four Palms. They are of a much harder Kind than the larger Stones in the leſſer Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; the Founders no doubt intending, that their leſſer Bulk ſhould be compenſated by Solidity. Of theſe there are only Six remaining upright; the Stumps of Two are left on the South-ſide by the Altar; one lies behind the Altar dug up, or thrown down, by the Fall of the Upright there. One or Two were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably thrown down by the Fall of the Upright of the firſt Trilithon on the Right-hand; a Stump of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other remains by the Upright there ſtill ſtanding.</p>
            <p>The whole Number of Stones may be thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. The great Oval conſiſts of Ten Uprights; the inner with the Altar of Twenty; the great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Thirty; the inner of Forty, which are One hundred upright Stones; Five Impoſts of the great Oval; Thirty of the great Circle; the Two Stones on the Bank of the Area; the Stone lying within the Entrance of the Area, and that ſtanding without; there ſeems to be another lying on the Ground, by the <hi>Vallum</hi> of the Court, directly oppoſite to the Entrance of the Avenue: all added together make juſt One hundred and forty Stones, the Number of which <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> a whole Temple, is compoſed. Behold the Solution of the mighty Problem! the magical Spell, which has ſo long perplex'd the Vulgar, is broken! They think it an ominous thing to count the true Number of the Stones, and whoever does ſo ſhall <hi>certainly</hi> die after it!</p>
            <p>As to the Altar, it is laid toward the upper End of the <hi>Adytum,</hi> at preſent flat on the Ground, and ſqueez'd into it, as it were, by the Weight of the Ruins upon it. 'Tis a kind of blue coarſe Marble, ſuch as comes from <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> and laid upon Tombs in our Churches and Church-yards. Our Author believes its Breadth is Two Cubits Three Palms, and that its firſt intended Length was Ten Cubits, equal to the Breadth of the Trilithon, before which it lies.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0141100401:271"/>
But it is very difficult to come at its true Length. 'Tis Twenty Inches thick, a juſt Cubit, and has been ſquar'd. It lies between the two Centres, that of the Compaſſes and that of the String; leaving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Space quite round it, no doubt as much as was neceſſary for this Miniſtration.</p>
            <p>The Heads of Oxen, Deer, and other Beaſts have been found upon digging in and about <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> undoubted Reliques of Sacrifices, together with Wood-aſhes. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays, Mens Bones have been found hereabouts; he means in the adjacent Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and ſuch our Author ſaw thrown out by the Rabbets, which have been brought hither of late Years, and by their burrowing threaten theſe noble Ruins; as the greedy Plough more and more invades the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Plain.</p>
            <p>But eternally, as he obſerves, is to be lamented the Loſs of that Tablet of Tin, which was found at this Place in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. inſcribed with many Letters; but in ſo ſtrange a Character, that neither Sir <hi>Thomas Elliot,</hi> a learned Antiquary, nor Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> Firſt High Maſter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s School, could make any thing out of; and which, no doubt, was a Memorial of the Founders, written by the Druids; and had it been preſerv'd till now, would have been an invaluable Curioſity.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1635, as they were plowing by the Barrows about <hi>Normanton-Ditch,</hi> they found ſo large a Quantity of excellent Pewter, as, at a low Price, they ſold for Five Pounds. There are ſeveral of theſe Ditches, being very narrow, which run acroſs the Downs, which perhaps are Boundaries of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Pariſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Pewter Plates might very poſſibly have been Tablets, with Inſcriptions; but falling into ſuch rude Hands, they could no more diſcern the Writing, than interpret it. No doubt, ſays Dr. <hi>Stukeley,</hi> this was ſome of the old <hi>Britiſh Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> which the <hi>Tyrian Hercules,</hi> ſurnam'd <hi>Melcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0141100401:272"/>
firſt brought <hi>ex Caſſiteride Inſula,</hi> or <hi>Britain:</hi> Which <hi>Hercules</hi> lived in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Time, or ſoon after.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> tells us, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> dug about <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> perhaps much to the Prejudice of the Work. Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> alſo did the like, and found what he imagined was the Corner of a <hi>Thuribulum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hayward,</hi> late Owner of <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dug about it, and found Heads of Oxen, and other Beaſts Bones, and nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> himſelf, in 1723, dug on the Inſide of the Altar, about the middle, Four Feet along the Edge of the Stone, Six Feet forward toward the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Adytum</hi>: at a Foot deep he came to the ſolid Chalk, mix'd with Flints, which had never been ſtirr'd. The Altar was exactly a Cubit-thick, <hi>i. e.</hi> Twenty Inches Four-fifths, but broken in Two or Three Pieces by the ponderous Maſſes of the Impoſts, and one upright Stone of that Trilithon, which ſtood at the upper End of the <hi>Adytum,</hi> being fallen upon it. Hence appears the Commodiouſneſs of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this huge Work! They dug Holes in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Chalk, which would of itſelf keep up the Stones as firm as if a Wall was built round them; and no doubt but they ramm'd up the Interſtices with Flints. But he ſays, he had too much Regard to the Work, to dig any-where near the Stones. He took up an Ox's Tooth above Ground, without the <hi>Adytum,</hi> on the Right-hand of the lowermoſt Trilithon Northward.</p>
            <p>The Time our Author aſſigns for the building of <hi>Stone-henge</hi> is not long after <hi>Cambyſes</hi>'s Invaſion of <hi>Egypt</hi>; when he committed ſuch horrid Outrages there, and made ſuch diſmal Havock with the Prieſts and Inhabitants in general, that they diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all the Parts of the World; ſome as far as the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi>; and ſome, it is not queſtioned, as far Weſtward, into <hi>Britain,</hi> and introduced ſome of their Learning, Arts and Religion among the <hi>Druids,</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0141100401:273"/>
and perhaps had a Hand in this very Work, the only one where the Stones are chiſſell'd; all other Works of theirs being of rude Stones, untouch'd of the Tool, exactly after the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Mode, and therefore older than this; and this Conjecture is the more probable, becauſe, at the time mention'd, the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Trade was at its Height, which afforded a readier Conveyance hither. This was before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was built; before the <hi>Grecians</hi> had any Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>For farther Particulars of this ſtupendous Work, and other curious Matters relating and adjacent to it (ſuch as its Antiquity before the Time of the <hi>Belgae,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi>; of the <hi>Wanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi>; of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Camp at <hi>Ambresbury</hi>; the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>Druids</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> which he puts about <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Time; its antient Name, [the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>]; the Water Vaſes of <hi>Stone-henge</hi>; the Avenue to it; the <hi>Curſus</hi>); we muſt refer our Readers to the Work itſelf, having already exceeded the narrow Bounds to which the Nature of our Deſign confines us. But this we may add, that doubtleſs they had ſome Method in former Days, in foreign Countries, as well as here, to move heavier Weights than we now find practicable. How elſe did <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men build the Battlement, or additional Wall, to ſupport the Precipice of <hi>Mount-Moriah,</hi> on which the Temple was erected; which was all built of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Marble, each Stone being Forty Cubits long, Fourteen broad, and Eight Cubits thick. And ſo much for this celebrated Temple of <hi>Stone-henge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall now proceed to give ſome Account of the famous Barrows on theſe Downs, and we ſhall borrow from the ſame learned Author, the following curious Particulars relating to them.</p>
            <p>The Tops of all the Hills, or rather eaſy Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, round <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> are in a manner cover'd over with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe Barrows, which make an agreeable
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0141100401:274"/>
Appearance, adorning the bare Downs with their Figures. This Ring of Barrows, however, reaches no farther, than till you loſe Sight of the Temple, as we now make no doubt to call <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> or thereabouts. Many, from the great Number of theſe ſepulchral <hi>Tumuli</hi> here, injudiciouſly conclude, that there have been great Battles upon the Plain, and that the Slain are buried there; but they are really no other than Family Burying-places ſet near this Temple, for the ſame Reaſon as we bury in Church-yards, and conſecrated Ground.</p>
            <p>We may readily count Fifty at a time in Sight from the Place, eſpecially in the Evening, when the ſloping Rays of the Sun ſhine on the Ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them. They are moſt of them of a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Bell-like Form, and done with great Nicety; in general they are always upon elevated Ground, and in Sight of the Temple, as we have ſaid; for they all regard it, and are aſſuredly the ſingle Sepulchres of Kings and great Perſonages buried, during a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Space of Time, and in Peace. There are many Groups of them together, as if Family Burial-places; and the Variety in them ſeems to indicate ſome Pre-eminence in the Perſons interred. Moſt of them have little Ditches around; in many is a circular Ditch, 60 Cubits in Diameter, with a very ſmall <hi>Tumulus</hi> in the Centre. Sixty, or even 100 Cubits, is a very common Diameter in the large Barrows. Often they are ſet in Rows, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtant, ſo as to produce a regular and pretty Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and with ſome particular Regard to the Parts of the Temple, the Avenues, or the <hi>Curſus.</hi> Upon every Range of Hills, quite round <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> are ſucceſſive Groups of Barrows for ſome Miles; and even that nam'd <hi>King-barrow,</hi> by Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s Park Wall at <hi>Wilton,</hi> which our Author calls the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0141100401:275"/>
Tomb of <hi>Carvilius,</hi> is ſet within View of <hi>Stone-henge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1722, the late Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi> opened a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, in order to find the Poſition of the Body ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in thoſe early Days. He pitched upon one of the double Barrows, where two are incloſed in one Ditch. He made a Section from the Top to the Bottom, an intire Segment from Centre to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The Compoſition was good Earth quite thro', except a Coat of Chalk of about Two Feet thick, covering it quite over, under the Turf. Hence it appears, that the Method of making theſe Barrows, was to dig up the Turf for a great Space round, till the Barrow was brought to its intended Bulk; then with the Chalk dug out of the inviron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ditch, they powder'd it all over. And the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sanctity annexed to them, forbad People trampling on them till perfectly ſettled and turfed over; whence the Neatneſs of their Form to this Day. At the Top or Centre of this Barrow, not above Three Feet under the Surface, my Lord found the Skeleton of the Interred, perfect, of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Size, the Head lying Northward towards <hi>Stone-henge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Year following, by my Lord's Order, Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> began upon another double Barrow. He began upon the leſſer, and made a large Cut on the Top from Eaſt to Weſt. After the Turf, he came to the Layer of Chalk, as before, then fine Garden Mould. About Three Feet below the Surface, a Layer of Flints humouring the Convexity of the Barrow, which are gathered from the Surface of the Downs in ſome Places, eſpecially where it has been ploughed. This being about a Foot thick, reſted on a Layer of ſoft Mould another Foot; in which was incloſed an Urn full of Bones. The Urn was of unbaked Clay, of a dark reddiſh Colour; crumbled into pieces. It had been rudely wrought with ſmall
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0141100401:276"/>
Mouldings round the Verge, and other circular Chanels on the Outſide, with ſeveral Indentions between, made with a pointed Tool. The Bones had been burnt, and crouded all together in a little Heap, not ſo much as a Hat-crown would contain; the Collar-bone, and one ſide of the Under-jaw remaining very intire. It appears to have been a Girl of about Fourteen Years old, by their Bulk, and the great Quantity of Female Ornaments mixed with the Bones; as great Numbers of glaſs Beads of all Sorts, and of divers Colours, moſt yellow, one black; many ſingle, many in long Pieces, notched between, ſo as to reſemble a String of Beads, and theſe were generally of a blue Colour. There were many of Amber, of all Shapes and Sizes, flat Squares, long Squares, round, oblong, little and great; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many of Earth, of different Shapes, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Colour; ſome little and white, many large and flattiſh, like a Button, others like a Pully; but all had Holes to run a String thro', either thro' their Diameter or Sides: Many of the Button Sort ſeem'd to have been covered with Metal, there being a Rim worked in them, wherein to turn the Edge of the Covering. One of theſe was covered with a thin Film of pure Gold. Theſe were the young Lady's Ornaments, and had all undergone Fire, ſo that what would eaſily conſume, fell to-pieces as ſoon as handled; much of the Amber burnt half thro': this Perſon was a Heroine; for we found the Head of her Javelin in Braſs. At Bottom are two Holes for the Pin that faſtened it to the Staff; beſides, there was a ſharp Bodkin, round at one End, ſquare at the other, where it went into the Handle. Our Author preſerved whatever is permanent of theſe Trinkets; but recompos'd the Aſhes of the illuſtrious Defunct, and covered them with Earth, leaving viſible Marks at Top of the Barrow having been open'd (to diſſuade any other
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0141100401:277"/>
from again diſturbing them): and this was his Practice in all the reſt.</p>
            <p>He then opened the next Barrow to it, incloſed in the ſame Ditch, which he ſuppoſed the Huſband or Father of this Lady. At 14 Inches deep, the Mould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>ng mixed with Chalk, he came to the intire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4+ letters">

               </gap>ingly rotten and periſhed, thro' Length of Time: tho' this was a Barrow of the lateſt Sort, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5+ letters">
                  <desc>•••••…</desc>
               </gap>ctured. The Body lay North and South, the Head to the North, as that Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>ed.</p>
            <p>Next he went Weſtward to a Group of Barrows, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Stone-henge</hi> bears Eaſt-north-eaſt. Here is a large Barrow ditch'd about, but of an antient Make. On that Side next <hi>Stone-henge</hi> are Ten leſſer, ſmall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> were, crouded together. South of the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Barrow, larger than thoſe of the Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>up, but not equalling the firſt: it would ſeem, that a Man and his Wife were buried in the Two larger, and that the reſt were of their Children or Dependents. One of the ſmall ones, 20 Cubits in Diameter, he cut thro', with a Pit Nine Feet in Diameter, to the Surface of the natural Chalk, in the Centre of the Barrow, where was a little Hole cut. A Child's Body, as it ſeems, had been burnt here, and covered up in that Hole; but thro' Length of Time conſumed. From Three Feet deep he found much Wood-aſhes, ſoft, and black as Ink, ſome little Bits of an Urn, and black and red Earth very rotten; ſome ſmall Lumps of Earth red as Vermilion; ſome Flints burnt thro'; toward the Bottom, a great Quantity of Aſhes, and burnt Bones. From this Place he counted 128 Barrows in Sight.</p>
            <p>Going from hence more Southerly, is a circular diſh-like Cavity, 60 Cubits in Diameter, dug in the Chalk, like a Barrow reverſed. 'Tis near a great Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the leaſt of the South-weſtern Group. This
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0141100401:278"/>
Cavity is Seven Feet deep in the Middle, extremely well turn'd; and out of it, no doubt, the adjacent Barrow is dug. The Uſe of it ſeems to have been a Place for ſacrificing and feaſting in Memory of the Dead, as was the antient Cuſtom. 'Tis all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with that pretty Shrub <hi>Erica Vulgaris,</hi> then in Flower, and ſmelling like Honey. He made a large croſs Section in its Centre, upon the Cardinal Points, and found nothing but a Bit of red earthen Pot.</p>
            <p>He then dug up one of thoſe he calls <hi>Druids</hi> Barrows, a ſmall <hi>Tumulus,</hi> incloſed in a large circular Ditch. <hi>Stone-henge</hi> bears hence North-eaſt. He made a croſs Section Ten Feet each way, Three Feet broad over its Centre upon the Cardinal Points: At length he found a ſquariſh Hole cut in the ſolid Chalk, in the Centre of the <hi>Tumulus</hi>; it was Three Feet and an half, <hi>i. e.</hi> Two Cubits long, and near Two Feet broad, <hi>i. e.</hi> One Cubit, pointing to <hi>Stone-henge</hi> directly. It was a Cubit and an half deep from the Surface. This was the <hi>Domus exilis Plutonia,</hi> covered with artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Earth, not above a Foot thick from the Surface. In this little Grave he found all the burnt Bones of a Man, but no Signs of an Urn. The Bank of the circular Ditch is on the Out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide, and is 12 Cubits broad. The Ditch is Six Cubits broad, (the <hi>Druid</hi>'s Staff); the Area is 70 Cubits in Diameter. The Whole 100.</p>
            <p>He opened another of theſe of like Dimenſions, next to that Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi> firſt opened, South of <hi>Stone-henge</hi>; and found a burnt Body in a Hole in the Chalk, as before.</p>
            <p>In ſome other Barrows he opened, were found large burnt Bones of Horſes and Dogs, along with human; alſo of other Animals, as ſeem'd of Fowl, Hares, Boars, Deer, Goats, or the like; and in a great and very flat old-faſhioned Barrow, Weſt from <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> among ſuch Matters, he found Bits of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0141100401:279"/>
red and blue Marble, Chippings of the Stones of the Temple, ſo that probably the Interred was one of the Builders. <hi>Homer</hi> tells of <hi>Achilles</hi> ſlaying Horſes and Dogs at the Funeral of his Friend <hi>Patroclus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Pembroke</hi> told the Doctor of a Braſs Sword dug up in a Barrow here, which was ſent to <hi>Oxford.</hi> In that very old Barrow near <hi>Little Ambreſbury,</hi> was found a very large Braſs Weapon of 20 Pounds Weight, like a Pole-ax, ſaid to be given to Colonel <hi>Wyndham.</hi> In the great long Barrow fartheſt North from <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> which our Author ſuppoſes to be an <hi>Archdruid's,</hi> was found one of thoſe Braſs Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments called <hi>Celts,</hi> which he thinks belong'd to the <hi>Druids,</hi> wherewith they cut off the Miſleto. Mr. <hi>Stallard</hi> of <hi>Ambreſbury</hi> gave it to Lord <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> now in Sir <hi>Hans Sloane</hi>'s Cabinet, 13 Inches long. They dug a Cell in a Barrow Eaſt of <hi>Ambreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and it was inhabited for ſome time. There they ſaw all the Bones of a Horſe. We find evidently, adds the Doctor, theſe antient Nations had the Cuſtom of burning their dead Bodies, probably before the Name of <hi>Rome.</hi> So <hi>Lacrymatories</hi> we read of in Scripture, antienter than <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Times. <hi>Pſalm</hi> lvi.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saliſbury</hi> Plains are certainly the moſt charming that can any-where be ſeen. The numerous Flocks of Sheep all around, which way ſoever we turn, are a fine Sight; 'tis ordinary for theſe Flocks to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from 3000 to 5000 each; and ſeveral private Farmers hereabouts have Two or Three ſuch Flocks.</p>
            <p>But 'tis more remarkable ſtill, how a great Part of theſe Downs comes, by a new Method of Huſbandry, not only to be made arable, but to bear plentiful Crops of Wheat, tho' never known to our Anceſtors to be capable of any ſuch Thing; nay, they would probably have laughed at any one that had gone about to plough up the wild Downs and Hills, which they thought only fit for Sheep-walks; but Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0141100401:280"/>
has made the preſent Age wiſer, and more ſkilful in Huſbandry; for by only folding the Sheep upon thoſe Lands, after they are turn'd up with the Plough, (which generally goes within Three or Four Inches of the ſolid Rock of Chalk) they become abundantly fruitful, and bear very good Wheat, as well as Rye and Barley. I ſhall ſay more of this, when I come to ſpeak of the ſame Practice farther in the Country.</p>
            <p>This plain open Country continues in Length from <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to <hi>Saliſbury</hi> 25 Miles, from thence to <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> 22 Miles, thence to <hi>Weymouth</hi> ſix Miles, ſo that they lie near 50 Miles in Length and Breadth; they reach alſo in ſome Places fron 35 to 40 Miles: Thoſe who would make any practicable Gueſs at the Number of Sheep which uſually feed on theſe Downs, may take it from a Calculation made, as I was told, at <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> that there were 600,000 Sheep fed within the Circumference of Six Miles around that Town.</p>
            <p>As we paſſed this open plain Country, we ſaw the Ruins of a great many old <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Camps, and other Remains of the antient Inhabitants of this Kingdom, and of their Wars, Battles, Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Encampments, Buildings, and other Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which are indeed very agreeable to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, that has read the Hiſtory of the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Old Sarum,</hi> which is the next Place we come to, is as remarkable as any of theſe, where there is a double Entrenchment, with a deep Graff, or Ditch, to either of them. 'Tis ſaid it was a <hi>Roman</hi> Station, and the antient <hi>Sorbiodunum.</hi> It was deſerted in King <hi>Henry</hi> III.'s Time, for want of Water, when the Inhabitants founded <hi>New Sarum.</hi> The old City is of an orbicular Form, erected on one of the moſt elegant Deſigns imaginable. It was, firſt, a Fortreſs of the antient <hi>Britons.</hi> The Proſpect of this Place is at preſent very auguſt, and would have afforded us
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0141100401:281"/>
a moſt noble Sight, when in Perfection. In the Angle to the North-weſt ſtood the Cathedral, and Epiſcopal Palace. The City fills up the Summit of an high and ſteep Hill, near the Bottom of which runs the River <hi>Avon.</hi> Here Synods and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments have formerly been held; and hither the States of the Kingdom were ſummoned to ſwear Fealty to <hi>William</hi> I. In this City was the Palace of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. Near it is one Farm-houſe, and that is all which is left of this antient City: yet this is called the Borough of <hi>Old Sarum,</hi> and ſends Two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to Parliament, who are choſen by the Proprietors of certain Lands. <hi>Whom</hi> thoſe Members can juſtly ſay <hi>they repreſent,</hi> would however be hard for them to anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saliſbury</hi> is a large, well-built, and pleaſant City; and the Founders of it ſeemed to have run from one Extreme to another; for as the old City wanted Water, this has rather too much, the Water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thro' the Middle of every Street, which, I think, does not add to the Beauty of the Town, but juſt the contrary; for it keeps the Streets always dirty, full of Wet and Filth, and Weeds, even in the Middle of Summer.</p>
            <p>The City lies at the Confluence of Two Rivers, the <hi>Avon,</hi> and the <hi>Willy,</hi> each of them ſingly a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable River, but very large, when joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and yet much larger, when they receive the <hi>Nadder,</hi> a third River, which joins them near <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi> Park about Three Miles below the City; when, with a deep Chanel, and a Current leſs rapid, they run down to <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> where they empty themſelves into the Sea. From that Town upwards, to within Two Miles of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> they are made navigable; but the Strength of the Stream would not permit to make them ſo up to the City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0141100401:282"/>
               <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> and all the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> are full of a great Variety of Manufactures; and thoſe too of the moſt conſiderable in <hi>England</hi>; as the Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade, and that of Flanels, Druggets, and alſo ſeveral other Sorts of Manufactures, of which in their Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saliſbury</hi> has, in particular, Two remarkable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures that flouriſh in it, which employ the Poor all around; namely, fine Flanels, and Long Cloths for the <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade, called <hi>Saliſbury Whites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cloſe adjacent to the Cathedral, in which live the Canons and Prebendaries, is ſo large and well-built, that it looks like a fine City of itſelf.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral is famous for the Height of its Spire, which is without Exception the higheſt and the handſomeſt in <hi>England,</hi> being from the Ground 410 Feet, and yet the Walls ſo exceeding thin, that at the Upper-part of the Spire, upon a View made by the late Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wren,</hi> the Wall was found to be leſs than five Inches thick; upon which a Conſultation was had, whether the Spire, or at leaſt the Upper-part of it, ſhould be taken down, it being ſuppoſed to have received ſome Damage by the great Storm in the Year 1703; but it was reſolved in the Negative, and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> ordered it to be ſtrengthened with Bands of Iron Plates, which have effectually ſecured it; and I have heard ſome of the beſt Architects ſay, it is ſtronger now than when it was firſt built.</p>
            <p>They tell us here long Stories of the great Art uſed in laying the firſt Foundation of this Church, the Ground being marſhy and wet, occaſioned by the Chanels of the Rivers; that it was laid upon Piles, according to ſome; and upon Woolpacks, according to others: But this is not to be believed by thoſe who know, that the whole Country is one Rock of Chalk, even from the Tops of the higheſt Hills, to the Bottom of the deepeſt Rivers. And the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0141100401:283"/>
of Woolpacks is, no doubt, allegorical, and has reſpect to the Woollen Trade.</p>
            <p>This Church was begun by Biſhop <hi>Poore,</hi> continu'd by <hi>Robert Bingham,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and finiſhed by <hi>Giles de Brideport,</hi> Biſhop of this See, all in the Space of 40 Years. The Model is after the Figure of a Croſs; and it coſt an immenſe Sum of Money; but it muſt be acknowledged, that the Inſide of the Work is not anſwerable, in the Decoration of Things, to the Workmanſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. The Painting in the Choir is mean, and more like the ordinary Method of a common Drawing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, or Tavern-painting, than that of a Church. The Carving is good, but there is very little of it, and it is rather a fine Church, than finely ſet off.</p>
            <p>But it now makes a better Appearance than it has done, having very lately been repaired by the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of the Biſhop and Prebendaries, ſet on foot by Biſhop <hi>Sherlock,</hi> who, it ſeems, thought that the Dignitaries ought to ſupport what ſupported them; and that all they got by the Church was not deſigned merely to make or inrich their Families.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Boaſt of this Building, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſes, muſt not be omitted:

            <p>Some of the Windows which eſcaped the Fury of the Zealots of 1641, are well painted.</p>
            <p>There are ſome very fine Monuments in this Church; particularly in that they call the <hi>Virgin Mary's Chapel,</hi> behind the Altar, is a noble Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a late Duke and Ducheſs of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> with
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0141100401:284"/>
their Pourtraits at full Length. The late Ducheſs of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> of the <hi>Piercy</hi> Family, alſo her Daughter the Marchioneſs of <hi>Caermarthen,</hi> and a ſecond Son of her Grace, both by the preſent Duke, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe interred here.</p>
            <p>The Figure of one <hi>Bennet,</hi> who endeavoured to imitate our Saviour in Faſting Forty Days and Forty Nights, as is there repreſented, carried his Point ſo far, that being reduced to a Skeleton, he fell a Victim to his preſumptuous and enthuſiaſtick Folly. The Bodies of the Biſhops <hi>Jewell, Uvall, Cheſt,</hi> were alſo interred here. Here is likewiſe a Monument to the beneficent Dr. <hi>Seth Ward,</hi> Biſhop of this See, who founded (amidſt other Benefactions, which we ſhall take notice of in <hi>Hertfordſhire</hi>) a handſome College for the Widows of Ten Miniſters, allowing to each 15<hi>l. per Annum</hi>; and which has been ſince obliged to Dr. <hi>Gilbert Burnet,</hi> Biſhop of this See.</p>
            <p>They ſhew you alſo the Monument of the Lord <hi>Stourton,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> which is made remarkable by a particular Incident; as follows:</p>
            <p>This Lord <hi>Stourton,</hi> being guilty of a Murder, which was aggravated with very bad Circumſtances, could not obtain the uſual Grace of the Crown, to be beheaded; but Queen <hi>Mary</hi> poſitively ordered, that, like a common Malefactor, he ſhould die at the Gallows. After he was executed, his Friends deſiring to have him bury'd at <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> the Biſhop would not conſent, that he ſhould be buried in the Cathedral, unleſs, as a farther Mark of Infamy, they would ſubmit to this Condition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the ſilken Halter in which he was hanged, ſhould be placed over his Grave in the Church, as a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Crime; which was accordingly done, and there it is to be ſeen at this Day.</p>
            <p>The putting this Halter up here, was not ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to me, as it was, that the Poſterity of that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0141100401:285"/>
Lord, who remained in good Rank ſome Time after, ſhould never prevail to have that Mark of Infamy taken from the Tomb of their Anceſtor.</p>
            <p>The Cloiſter is 160 Feet ſquare, the inner Cioiſter 30 Feet wide, with 10 Arches on each Side, the Top vaulted, and covered with Lead. Over the Eaſt Walk of the Cloiſter, is a ſpacious Library, but not over-well ſtocked with Books. The Chapter-houſe is Octagon, and is 150 Feet in Circumference; the Roof bearing all upon one ſmall Marble Pillar in the Centre, which ſeems ſo feeble, that it is hardly to be imagined it can be any great Support to it, which makes it the more curious; and indeed, I believe, it is hardly to be matched in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Corporation of <hi>Sarum</hi> have lately purchaſed a very fine Original Piece of Painting of her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> drawn by the celebrated <hi>Dahl,</hi> and have put it up in the Council-chamber of the City. This Picture formerly belonged to the Society of Gentlemen (all Members of Parliament) known by the Name of the <hi>October Club,</hi> and was ſet up in the great Room belonging to the <hi>Bell</hi> (now <hi>Crown</hi>) Tavern in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where they uſed to meet till the Death of Queen <hi>Anne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1736-7, an Act paſſed for the better Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Paving the Highways, Streets, and Water-courſes within this City, and for Enlightening the Streets, Lanes, and Paſſages, and better regulating the Nightly Watch.</p>
            <p>From hence directing my Courſe to the Sea-ſide, in purſuit of my firſt Deſign of viewing the whole Coaſt of <hi>England</hi>; I left the great Road, and went down the Eaſt-ſide of the River towards <hi>New-Foreſt</hi> and <hi>Lymington</hi>; and here I ſaw the antient Houſe and Seat of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which gives Title to the Earl of that Name. This Place ſhould be called <hi>Clorendon,</hi> from the memorable <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, half a Mile off the Park, near the <hi>Roman</hi> Road, made or repaired by
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0141100401:286"/>
               <hi>Conſtantius Chlorus,</hi> Father of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> It is a beautiful Fortification, of a round Form, upon a dry chalky Hill. Within is a circular Ditch, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a leſs Sort of Camp for the Summer. The Park is a ſweet and beautiful Spot. Here King <hi>John</hi> built a Palace, where ſeveral Parliaments have been held. Part of the Fabrick is ſtill left, tho' they have for many Years been pulling it down. The Meterials are chiefly Flint, and it was built upon the Side of an Hill, but no way fortified, tho' it took up much Ground. This Palace is called the <hi>Manor,</hi> and from it lies a ſubterraneous Paſſage to the <hi>Queen's Manor.</hi> Between the Camp and the Park, was a <hi>Roman</hi> Road, from <hi>Sorbiodunum,</hi> or <hi>Old Sarum,</hi> to <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this being a large County, and full of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Branches of Antiquity, and modern Curioſity, I made ſeveral little Excurſions from this beautiful Spot, to view the Northern Parts of the County.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned, that this County is generally a vaſt continued Body of high chalky Hills, whoſe Tops ſpread themſelves into fruitful and pleaſant Downs and Plains, upon which great Flocks of Sheep are fed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Reader is deſired to obſerve, theſe Hills and Plains are moſt beautifully interſected, and cut thro', by the Courſe of divers pleaſant and profitable Rivers; along, and near the Banks of which, there always is a Chain of fruitful Meadows, and rich Paſtures, and thoſe interſperſed with a great many pleaſant Towns, Villages, and Houſes, and among them many of conſiderable Magnitude; ſo that, while you view the <hi>Downs,</hi> and think the Country wild and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, yet when you come to deſcend into theſe Vales, you are ſurpriſed with the moſt pleaſant and fertile Country in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No leſs than Four of theſe Rivers meet all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at or near the City of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> the Waters
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0141100401:287"/>
of Three of which run thro' the Streets of the City; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Nadder,</hi> the <hi>Willy,</hi> and the <hi>Avon.</hi> 1. The <hi>Nadder</hi> riſes near the End of the <hi>Blow Mill Courſe,</hi> and paſſes by <hi>Chilmark,</hi> a pleaſant Village, noted for its Quarries of very good white Stone, which riſes in many Dimenſions, inſomuch that there is now a ſingle Stone lying over the Mouth of the Quarry like an Architrave, full 60 Feet long, 12 in Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and perfectly without Flaw. 2. The <hi>Willy</hi> riſes about <hi>Warminſter</hi>; runs by <hi>Yarnbury,</hi> a vaſt <hi>Roman</hi> Camp (where ſome diſtinguiſh <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Name; a great ſemicircular Work at the Entrance; over-againſt which, on the other Side the <hi>Willy,</hi> is another Camp); then running by <hi>Orcheſtra,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for a Kind of Graſs 25 Feet in Length, with which they fatten Hogs, it gives Name to <hi>Wilton,</hi> and forms the Canal before the Front of <hi>Wilton</hi> Houſe; and then joining the <hi>Nadder,</hi> runs thro' the Gardens at the End of the Avenue. 3. The <hi>Avon</hi> riſes from under a great Ridge of Hills, which divide <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> into North and South, adorn'd with the <hi>Wanſdike.</hi> It paſſes Southward thro' a great Number of Villages to <hi>Ambreſbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is moſt worth a Man of Curioſity's ſeeing in this County, is <hi>Wilton</hi> Houſe. It is ſituated in a pleaſant Vale, having <hi>Wilton</hi> Town on one Side, and a ſpacious Park on the other.</p>
            <p>The Building was begun in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. The great Quadrangle was finiſhed in the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and the Porch was deſigned by <hi>Hans Holbein.</hi> The Hall-ſide, being burnt down ſome Years ago, was rebuilt by the late <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> then Lord High-Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> in a very noble and ſumptuous manner. The other Parts, rebuilt by the firſt <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> were all deſigned by the famous <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> and finiſhed by him in the Year 1640.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0141100401:288"/>The Canal before the Houſe lies parallel with the Road, and receives into it the whole River <hi>Willy,</hi> or at leaſt is able to do ſo; it may indeed be ſaid, that the River is made into a Canal. When we come into the Court-yards before the Houſe, there are ſeveral Pieces of Antiquity to entertain the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; as particularly a noble Column of Porphyry, with a Marble Statue of <hi>Venus</hi> on the Top of it; which, as they told me, is 32 Feet high, and of excellent Workmanſhip, and that it came laſt from <hi>Candia,</hi> but formerly from <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the late Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was a Nobleman of great Learning, beyond moſt Men of his high Rank, and a Maſter of Antiquity, he took Delight in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſuch valuable Pieces of Painting and Sculpture, as made <hi>Wilton</hi> Houſe a perfect <hi>Muſeum,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of Rarities; and we meet with ſeveral Things there, which are to be found no-where elſe in the World. I ſhall particularize but a few; for a Volume might be employ'd in a full Deſcription of them.</p>
            <p>The Piece of our Saviour's waſhing his Diſciples Feet, which they ſhew you in one of the firſt Rooms you go into, is admirable. At the Foot of the great Stair-caſe is a <hi>Bacchus</hi> as large as the Life, done in fine <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> Marble, carrying a young <hi>Bacchus</hi> on his Arm, the young one eating Grapes, and ſhewing by his Countenance, he is pleaſed with the Taſte of them. One ought to ſtop every Two Steps of this Stair-caſe, as we go up, to contemplate the vaſt Variety of Pictures that cover the Walls, and of ſome of the beſt Maſters in <hi>Europe</hi>; and yet this is but an Introduction to what is beyond them.</p>
            <p>The great Geometrical Stair-caſe itſelf is deſervedly admired, and was the firſt of this Kind in <hi>England</hi>; and the rich and magnificent Door-caſe can hardly be parallell'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0141100401:289"/>'Tis univerſally acknowledged, that the grand Apartment is one of the nobleſt Pieces of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture that has been hitherto produced; particularly the <hi>Salon</hi>; which is 60 Feet long, 30 high, and 30 broad; and when you are enter'd theſe grand Apartments, ſuch Variety ſtrikes upon you every Way, that you ſcarce know to which Hand to turn yourſelf firſt. On one Side you ſee ſeveral Rooms filled with Paintings, all ſo curious, and various, that it is with Reluctance you leave them; and looking another way, you are called off by a vaſt Collection of Buſts, and Pieces of the greateſt Antiquity of the Kind, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one End of the grand Room is the celebrated Family-picture by <hi>Vandyke,</hi> 20 Feet long, and 12 Feet high, containing 13 Figures as big as the Life; which rather appear as ſo many real Perſons, than the Production of Art: and all the other Pictures there are of the ſame incomparable Hand. It would be endleſs to deſcribe the whole Set of the Family-pictures, which take up this Room, unleſs we would enter into the Roof-tree of the Family, and ſet down a Genealogical Line of the whole Houſe.</p>
            <p>After this fine Range of Beauties are ſeen, we are far from being at an End of our Surprize: there are three or four Rooms ſtill upon the ſame Floor, filled with Wonders: nothing can be finer than the Pictures themſelves, nothing more ſurpriſing than the Number of them. At length you deſcend the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs, which are large, tho' not like the other, where not a Hand's Breadth is left vacant between the Pictures; and even the upper Rooms have ſome very good Pieces in them.</p>
            <p>In moſt of the Apartments are Marble Chimney-pieces of the moſt exquiſite Workmanſhip, all carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Italy,</hi> with many curious Statues, Baſſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo's, and Pictures of the moſt famous Maſters.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0141100401:290"/>
The <hi>Loggio</hi> in the Bowling-green, (which has Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars beautifully ruſticated, and is inriched with Niches and Statues) the <hi>Grotto,</hi> (the Front of which is curiouſly carved without, as it is all Marble within, and has black Pillars of the <hi>Ionic</hi> Order, with Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of white Marble, and Four fine Baſſo Relievo's from <hi>Florence</hi>) the Stables, and other Offices, are all Beauties in their Kind, which would tire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
            <p>The Collection of Head-pieces, Coats of Mail, and other Armour for both Horſe and Man, are alſo a Curioſity. They ſhew thoſe of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and of an Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Black Jack,</hi> which he wore when he beſieged and took <hi>Bulloign</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> being the General who commanded in chief under the King; they are very curious and imboſs'd. Twelve other complete Suits of Armour, of extraordinary Workmanſhip, are alſo there; the reſt, being about 100, are only for common Horſe-men.</p>
            <p>The Garden Front is juſtly eſteemed one of the beſt Pieces of the renowned <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> and is 194 Feet long.</p>
            <p>The Gardens are on the South of the Houſe, and extend themſelves beyond the River, a Branch of which runs thro' one Part of them; and ſtill South of the Gardens is the great Park, which reaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Vale; the View opens to the great Down, which is properly called, by way of Diſtinction, <hi>Salisbury-plain,</hi> and leads from the City of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> to <hi>Shaftſbury.</hi> Here alſo his Lordſhip has a <hi>Hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warren,</hi> as 'tis called, tho' improperly. It has indeed been a Sanctuary for the Hares for many Years; but the Gentlemen complain, that it mars their Game; for that, as ſoon as they put up a Hare <hi>for their Sport,</hi> if it be any-where within two or three Miles, away ſhe runs for the Warren, and there is an End of their Purſuit. On the other hand,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0141100401:291"/>
it makes all the Countrymen turn Poachers, and deſtroy the Hares, by what Means they can. The preſent Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who, as his Father had, has alſo a fine Taſte in Architecture, has made a further Improvement with regard to Proſpect, at this noble Houſe, throwing down the Walls of the Garden, and making inſtead of them the newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced Haw-haw Walls, which afford a boundleſs View all around the Country from every Quarter. His Lordſhip has alſo built a moſt magnificent Bridge over the River in his Garden, which is eſteemed the principal Ornament without Doors of this noble Seat.</p>
            <p>From this pleaſant and agreeable Place I returned to <hi>Clarendon.</hi> The Road from <hi>Wilton</hi> to <hi>Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> called <hi>The Ten Mile Courſe,</hi> is a fine Ridge of Downs, continued upon the Southern Bank of the River <hi>Nadder,</hi> with a ſweet Proſpect to the Right and Left all the way over the Towns and the Country on both Sides. The late Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> has placed a number'd Stone at every Mile, for the Benefit of Travellers. Between the 5th and 6th Mile is a pretty large Camp, called <hi>Chiſelbury,</hi> probably <hi>Roman</hi> in the Decline of the Empire. At the End of this Courſe are three or four <hi>Celtic</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. In this Hill is a Quarry of Stone very full of Sea Shells. Not far off, in the Pariſh of <hi>Tisbury,</hi> near <hi>Warder-caſtle,</hi> is a great Entrenchment in a Wood, which was probably a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Town near the <hi>Nadder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Returning, we ſee, upon the higheſt Eminence which overlooks <hi>Wilton,</hi> and the fertile Valley at the Union of the <hi>Nadder</hi> and <hi>Willy,</hi> the noted Place called <hi>King-barrow,</hi> mentioned <hi>p.</hi> 267. This is certainly <hi>Celtick,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>Stukeley,</hi> and, with great Probability, the very Tomb of that <hi>Carvilius,</hi> who attacked <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Sea-camp in order to divert his renown'd Enemy from his cloſe Purſuit of <hi>Caſſibelan.</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0141100401:292"/>
This Prince is ſuppoſed to have kept his Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at <hi>Carvilium,</hi> now <hi>Wilton,</hi> near which Place King <hi>Edgar's</hi> Queen ſpent the latter Part of her Life in a religious Retirement, and for that Purpoſe built a Houſe there.</p>
            <p>The Downs and Plains in this Part of <hi>England</hi> being ſo open, and the Surface ſo little ſubject to Alteration, there are more Remains of Antiquity to be ſeen upon them, than in other Places; and, as they tell us, no leſs than Three-and-fifty antient Incampments, or Fortifications, in this one County; ſome of which are very viſible, and are of different Forms, and erected by different Nations; as <hi>Britiſh, Daniſh, Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi>; particularly at <hi>Ebb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down, Burywood, Oldburgh-hill, Cummerford, Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-down, St. Anne's-hill, Bratton-caſtle, Clay-hill, Stournton-park, Whitecole-hall, Battlebury, Scrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Yanesbury, Frippsbury, Suthbury-hill, Ambreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> mentioned before; <hi>Great Bodwyn, Eaſterley, Merdon, Aubery, Martenſcil-hill, Barbury-caſtle,</hi> &amp;c. At <hi>Aubery,</hi> or <hi>Aukbury,</hi> in particular, on the Eaſt Side of the <hi>Avon,</hi> by <hi>Great Dornford,</hi> is a very large Camp, covering the whole Top of a Hill. On the other Side of the River, a little higher up, is <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Camp, called <hi>The Walls.</hi> Near theſe are two other Camps, which ſeem Remains of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Victories, and intimate that he ſubdued the Country by Inches.</p>
            <p>North of theſe is <hi>Martin's-hall-hill,</hi> a vaſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary <hi>Roman</hi> Camp. On two Sides the Precipice is dreadfully ſteep. The Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> has a Braſs <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> found here; on the Reverſe, <hi>Jupiter fulminans.</hi> On the Weſt Side, at Top of the Hill, without the Camp, is a round Pit full of good Spring-water, always to the Brim (but never overflowing) in the dryeſt Summers; which at thoſe Seaſons is of the greateſt Service to the Country round; and Thouſands of Cattle are every Day
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0141100401:293"/>
driven thither, from a conſiderable Diſtance, to drink. I am informed, there is ſuch another upon the Top of <hi>Chute-hill,</hi> South-eaſt from hence, very high, and no other Water within ſome Miles of it. The Proſpect from <hi>Martin's-hall</hi> is exceeding fine.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Farlo,</hi> not far from <hi>Clarendon-Park,</hi> was the Birth-place of Sir <hi>Stephen Fox,</hi> and where the Town, ſharing in his good Fortune, ſhews ſeveral Marks of his Bounty; as particularly the building a New Church from the Foundation, and getting an Act of Parliament paſſed, for making it Parochial, it being but a Chapel of Eaſe before to an adjoining Pariſh: alſo Sir <hi>Stephen</hi> built and endowed an Alms-houſe here for Six poor Women, with a Maſter and a Free-ſchool. The Maſter is to be a Clergyman, and to officiate in the Church, which, including the School, is a very good Maintenance.</p>
            <p>I am now to purſue my firſt Deſign, and ſhall take the Weſt Part of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> in my Return, where are ſeveral Things to be ſtill taken notice of. In the mean time I went on to <hi>Langbro',</hi> a fine Seat of my Lord <hi>Colerain,</hi> which is very well kept.</p>
            <p>From hence in my Way to the Sea-ſide I came to <hi>New-Foreſt,</hi> of which I have ſaid ſomething already with relation to the great Extent of Ground; which lies waſte, and has a vaſt Quantity of large Timber.</p>
            <p>This Part of the Country is a laſting Monument of the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s Tyranny and Oppreſſion, who laid it open and waſte for a Foreſt, and for Game; for which Purpoſe he unpeopled the Country, pulled down the Houſes and the Churches of ſeveral Pariſhes and Towns, and of abundance of Villages, turning the poor People out of their Habitations and Poſſeſſions, for the ſake of his Deer. The ſame Hiſtories likewiſe record, that Two of his own Sons, and particularly his immediate Succeſſor <hi>William Rufus,</hi> loſt their Lives in this Foreſt; <hi>William Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0141100401:294"/>
being ſhot with an Arrow directed at a Deer, which glancing on a Tree, changed its Courſe, and ſtriking the King full on the Breaſt, killed him. And another Son, whilſt in hot Purſuit of the Game, was caught up by the Boughs of a Tree, and hanged like <hi>Abſalom.</hi> Theſe they relate as juſt Judgments of God on the cruel Devaſtation made here by the Conqueror, and they ſtill ſhew the Tree on which the Arrow glanced. In King <hi>Charles</hi> II's Time, the Tree was ordered to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a Pale, great Part of which is now fallen down; and whether the Tree be really ſo old or not, is to me a great Queſtion, the Action being about 700 Years ago.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit mentioning here a Propoſal made ſome Years ago to the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Godolphin,</hi> for repeopling this Foreſt, which I can be more particular in than any other Man, becauſe I had the Honour to draw up the Scheme, and argue it before that noble Lord, and ſome others who were principally concerned at that time in bringing over, or rather providing for, when they were come over, the poor Inhabitants of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; a Thing in itſelf commendable; but, as it was managed, made of no Benefit to <hi>England,</hi> and miſerable to thoſe poor People.</p>
            <p>Some Perſons being ordered by the noble Lord above-mentioned, to conſider of Meaſures how thoſe poor People ſhould be provided for, without Injury to the Publick, NEW FOREST in <hi>Hampſhire</hi> was ſingled out to be the Place for them.</p>
            <p>Here it was propoſed to draw a great ſquare Line, containing 4000 Acres of Land, marking out Two large Highways or Roads thro' the Centre, croſſing both Ways, ſo that there ſhould be 1000 Acres in each Diviſion, excluſive of the Land contained in the ſaid Croſs-roads.</p>
            <p>

To each of theſe ſhould be parcelled, but in equal Diſtributions, 200 Acres of this Land; ſo that the whole 4000 Acres ſhould be diſtributed to the ſaid 20 Families, for which they ſhould have no Rent to pay, and be liable to no Taxes, but ſuch as would provide for their own Sick or Poor, repairing their own Roads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Exemption to continue for 20 Years, and then to pay each 50<hi>l.</hi> a Year to the Crown.</p>
            <p>To each of theſe Families, it was propoſed to advance 200<hi>l.</hi> in ready Money, as a Stock to ſet them to work, and to hire and pay Labourers, to incloſe, clear, and cure the Land; which it was ſuppoſed, the firſt Year, could not be ſo much to their Advantage as following Years, allowing them Timber out of the Foreſt to build themſelves Houſes and Barns, Sheds and Offices, as they ſhould have Occaſion; alſo for Carts, Waggons, Ploughs, Harrows, and the like neceſſary Things.</p>
            <p>Theſe 20 Families would, by the Conſequence of their own Settlements, employ and maintain ſuch a Proportion of others of their own People, that the whole Number of <hi>Palatines</hi> would have been provided for, had they been many more than they were, and that without being any Burden upon, or Injury to the People of <hi>England</hi>; on the contrary, they would have been an Advantage, and an Addition of Wealth and Strength to the Nation, and to the Country in particular, where they ſhould be thus ſeated.</p>
            <p>Two Things would have been anſwered by the Execution of this Scheme; <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the annual Rent to be received for all thoſe Lands after 20 Years, would abundantly pay the Publick for the firſt Diſburſes, which
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0141100401:296"/>
would amount to 80,000<hi>l.</hi> that Rent being then to amount to 40,000<hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. More Money than would have done this, was thrown away upon them here, to keep them in Suſpenſe, and afterwards ſtarve them; ſending them a begging all over the Nation, and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them off to periſh in other Countries.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Spot where the Deſign was laid out, was near <hi>Lindhurſt,</hi> in the Road from <hi>Rumſey</hi> to <hi>Lymington:</hi> whither I now directed my Courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lymington</hi> is a little, but populous Sea-port, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſite to the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> in the narrow Part of the Streight, which Ships ſometimes paſs thro' in fair Weather, called the <hi>Needles</hi>; and right againſt the antient Town of <hi>South-Yarmouth,</hi> in that Iſle which I have mentioned before. This Town of <hi>Lymington</hi> is chiefly noted for making excellent Salt; from whence all theſe South Parts of <hi>England</hi> are ſupplied, as well by Water as Land-carriage.</p>
            <p>From hence are but few Towns on the Sea-coaſt Weſt, tho' ſeveral conſiderable Rivers empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Sea; nor are there any Harbours or Sea-ports of Note, except <hi>Pool.</hi> As for <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> tho' it ſtands at the Mouth of the <hi>Avon,</hi> which, as I have ſaid, comes down from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and brings with it all the Waters of South and Eaſt Parts of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and receives alſo the <hi>Stour</hi> and <hi>Piddle,</hi> Two <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> Rivers, which bring with them all the Waters of the North Part of <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi>; yet it is a very inconſiderable poor Place, ſcarce worth ſeeing, and leſs worth mentioning in this Account.

                  <hi>In hoc loco quieſcit Corpus</hi> S. Etheldredi, <hi>Regis</hi> Weſt Saxonum, <hi>Martyris, qui Anno Dom. DCCCLXXII. xxiii.</hi> Aprilis, <hi>per Manus</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum <hi>Paganorum Occubuit.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here alſo are the Monuments of the great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs of <hi>Exeter,</hi> Mother of <hi>Edward Courtney,</hi> Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and laſt of the Family of <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,</hi> who enjoy'd that Honour; as alſo of <hi>John de Beaufort,</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and his Wife, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. by her Daughter <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This laſt Lady I mention, becauſe ſhe was Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of a very fine Free-School, which has ſince been inlarg'd, and had a new Benefactreſs in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who augmented the Stipend, and annex'd it to the Foundation. The famous Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> was Dean of this Church before his Exaltation.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Wimburnminſter</hi> are numerous, but poor, and chiefly maintain'd by the Manufacture of knitting Stockens, which employs great Part of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0141100401:299"/>
the County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> of which this is the firſt Town Eaſtward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wimbourn St. Giles</hi>'s, in this Neighbourhood, is a very handſome Seat belonging to the Earl of <hi>Shafteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I went to <hi>Ringwood,</hi> upon the River <hi>Avon,</hi> over a deep ſandy Moor. 'Tis a large thriving Place, full of good new Brick Houſes, ſeated by the Side of a great watry Valley, the River dividing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into ſeveral Streams, and frequently overflowing large Quantities of the Meadow. Here they deal pretty much in Leather, Stockens, Druggets, and narrow Cloth.</p>
            <p>South of <hi>Wimburn,</hi> over a ſandy, wild and barren Country, we came to <hi>Pool,</hi> a conſiderable Sea-port, and indeed the moſt conſiderable in all this Part of <hi>England</hi>; for here I found ſome Ships, ſome Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and ſome Trade; eſpecially here was a good Number of Ships fitted out every Year to the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland</hi> Fiſhing, in which the <hi>Pool Men</hi> have been particularly ſucceſsful for many Years paſt.</p>
            <p>The Town ſits in the Bottom of a great Bay, or Inlet of the Sea, which, entering at one narrow Mouth, opens to a great Breadth within the Entrance, and comes up to the very Shore of this Town; it runs alſo Weſt up almoſt to <hi>Warcham,</hi> a little below which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the <hi>Froom</hi> and <hi>Piddle,</hi> the Two principal Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the County.</p>
            <p>This Place is famous for the beſt and biggeſt Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in all this Part of <hi>England,</hi> which the People of <hi>Pool</hi> pretend to be famous for pickling; and they are barrell'd up here, and ſent not only to <hi>London,</hi> but to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and to <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and other Parts. 'Tis obſerv'd, more Pearl are found in the <hi>Pool</hi> Oyſters, and larger, than in any others in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Entrance into this large Bay is narrow, ſo it is made narrower by an Iſland called <hi>Brankſey,</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0141100401:300"/>
which lying in the very Mouth of the Paſſage, divides it into two, and where there is an old Caſtle, call'd <hi>Brankſey</hi> Caſtle, built to defend the Entrance, and was of no ſmall Advantage to the Trade of this Port, in the time of the late War with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wareham</hi> has been a <hi>Roman</hi> Town. There has been a Caſtle by the Water-ſide, Weſt of the Bridge, built by King <hi>William</hi> I. perhaps upon the <hi>Roman.</hi> 'Tis an old Corporation, now decay'd, the Sands obſtructing the Paſſage of the Veſſels. And <hi>Pool</hi> being better ſeated, from a Fiſher-Town, has riſen to be a rich Sea-port. They ſay here have been a Mint, and many Pariſh-Churches, of which Three remain. I ſaw a ruinous Religious Houſe, as I paſs'd by the River <hi>Frome.</hi> This Haven is of vaſt Extent, like a Sea, having a narrow Entry. Two Rocks about <hi>Corf-Caſtle</hi> have an odd Appearance hence.</p>
            <p>South of <hi>Wareham,</hi> and between the Bay I have mention'd, and the Sea, lies a large Track of Land, which being ſurrounded by the Sea, except on one Side, is call'd an Iſland, tho' it is really more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Peninſula. This Track of Land is better inhabited than the Sea Coaſt of this Weſt End of <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> generally is, and the Manufacture of Stockens is carry'd on there alſo. It is call'd <hi>The Iſle of Purbeck,</hi> and has in the middle of it a large Market-town, call'd <hi>Corf</hi>; and from the famous Caſtle there, the whole Town is now call'd <hi>Corf-Caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Part of the Country is eminent for vaſt Quarries of Stone, which is cut out flat, and uſed in <hi>London</hi> in great Quantities, for paving Court-yards, Alleys, Avenues to Houſes, Kitchens, Foot-ways on the Sides of the High-ſtreets, and the like; and is very profitable to the Place, as alſo in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Shipping employed in bringing it to <hi>London.</hi> There are alſo ſeveral Rocks of very good Marble,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0141100401:301"/>
only that the Veins in the Stone are not black and white, as the <hi>Italian,</hi> but grey, red, and other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. It is alſo noted for excellent Tobacco-pipe Clay, ſold at <hi>London</hi> for Thirty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ton.</p>
            <p>From hence to <hi>Weymouth</hi> we rode in View of the Sea. The Country is open, and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects pleaſant, but not like the Northern Parts of the Country, which are all fine Carpet Ground, and the Herbage ſo ſweet, that their Sheep are eſteem'd the beſt in <hi>England,</hi> and their Wool extremely fine.</p>
            <p>From hence we turned up to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> the County Town. It is regular and clean. The <hi>Iſening-ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reet</hi> enters it by the North of <hi>Winterburn</hi> at <hi>Weſt-gate.</hi> This is by the ignorant Country-people referr'd to the Work of the Devil, who, they ſay, caſt it up in a Night's time. The Foundations of the antient <hi>Roman</hi> Wall appear qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e round the Town; but Eaſtward a Street is built upon it, and the Ditch fill'd up: 'tis ſtill call'd <hi>The Walls</hi>; for that way the Town is ſwell'd out into a conſiderable Village, with a Church, and handſome Tower, nam'd <hi>Fordington</hi> or <hi>Farington.</hi> There are Three other Churches in the Town, and the Streets are wide and handſome. On the South and Weſt Side, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Walls, a handſome Walk of Trees is planted, looking pleaſantly into the Country; tho' being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>camores, they are inconvenient by harbouring Flies. The Banks of the River here are ſteep; for the Town ſtands on high Ground. Beyond the River are Meadows, and warm ſandy Lands; on this Side, the fine chalky Downs, pleaſant for riding, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in excellent Grain. The Air muſt needs be wholſome, the Climate warm, and a ſufficient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Sea. The People of <hi>Fordington</hi> roſe in Arms, and prevented the Farmers from levelling a great Barrow. The late Rev. Mr. <hi>Place,</hi> known for his Philoſophical Works, liv'd here, and poſſeſs'd a great Quantity of <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, call'd here <hi>Dorn-money,</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0141100401:302"/>
or <hi>King Dor's Money.</hi> Near this Place is a noble <hi>Roman</hi> Amphitheatre. The Vulgar call it <hi>Maumbury</hi>; but have no Notion of its Purpoſe, tho' 'tis a common Excurſion for the Inhabitants; and the Terrace on the Top is a noted Place of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, affording an agreeable circular Walk, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Town, and wide Plains of Corn Fields all around.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> is a regular Town, with handſome wide Streets, but the Houſes, tho' built of Stone, are old and low. It is kept very clean, by reaſon of its high Situation, and the River on which it is ſituated.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants Care in ſetting the able Poor to work, and relieving the Aged and Impotent, is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praiſe-worthy. And Sir <hi>Joſiah Child,</hi> in his Treatiſe on Trade, recommends their Example as worthy to be followed by other Places. It is famous alſo for excellent Beer.</p>
            <p>On the pleaſant Downs round this Town, they told me, there were 600,000 Sheep fed within Six Miles of the Town every way, which is 12 Miles in Diameter, and 36 Miles in Circumference; and when I viewed the Country round, I confeſs I could not but incline to believe it.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable of theſe Sheep, that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fruitful; and the Ewes generally bringing Two Lambs, they are for that Reaſon bought by all the Farmers thro' the Eaſt Part of <hi>England,</hi> who come to <hi>Burford</hi> Fair in this County for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and carry them into <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Surrey</hi> Eaſtward, and into <hi>Buckinghamſhire, Bedfordſhire,</hi> and <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> North. Even our <hi>Banſtead-Downs</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> ſo fam'd for good Mut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, is ſupplied from this Place. The Herbage of theſe Downs is full of the moſt aromatick Plants, ſuch as nouriſh the Sheep to a great Degree, and the Sheeps Dung again nouriſhes that; ſo that the Valleys are render'd extremely
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0141100401:303"/>
fruitful by the waſhing of the Water in haſty Showers from off theſe Hills.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> it is Six Miles to the Sea-ſide South, and the Ocean in View almoſt all the Way: The firſt Towns we come to are <hi>Weymouth</hi> and <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb,</hi> two Towns lying at the Mouth of a little Rivulet, call'd <hi>The Wey,</hi> for it ſcarce deſerves the Name of a River: however, the Entrance makes a very good, tho' ſmall Harbour, and they are join'd by a wooden Bridge, ſo that nothing but the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour parts them; yet they are ſeparate Corporations, and chooſe each of them Two Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Weymouth</hi> is a ſweet, clean, agreeable Town, (conſidering its low Situation) and cloſe to the Sea: 'tis well-built, and has a great many ſubſtantial Merchants in it, who drive a conſiderable Trade, and have a great Number of Ships belonging to the Town: they carry on, in time of Peace, a Trade with <hi>France</hi>; but beſides this, they trade alſo to <hi>Portugal, Spain, Newfoundland,</hi> and <hi>Virginia</hi>; and have a large Correſpondence up in the Country for the Conſumption of their Returns. The Wine and <hi>Newfoundland</hi> Trade are both conſiderable here; and they have a Cuſtom-houſe and good Key.</p>
            <p>Without the Harbour is an old Caſtle, call'd <hi>Sandfoot Caſtle</hi>; and over-againſt them is <hi>Portland Caſtle,</hi> ſituated in the Iſle of that Name, and the Road called <hi>Portland Road,</hi> which affords a ſafe Harbour for Ships in bad Weather.</p>
            <p>From this Iſle of <hi>Portland</hi> comes our beſt and whiteſt Free-ſtone, with which the Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, the Monument, and all the publick Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the City of <hi>London,</hi> are chiefly built; and the Quarries whence theſe Stones are dug, are well worth the Obſervation of a Traveller.</p>
            <p>The Iſland is indeed little more than one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Rock of Free-ſtone, about Seven Miles in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0141100401:304"/>
and the Height of the Land is ſuch, that from this Iſland they ſee, in clear Weather, above half over the Chanel to <hi>France,</hi> tho' here 'tis very broad. The Sea off this Iſland, and eſpecially to the Weſt of it, is counted the moſt dangerous Part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Chanel. Due South, there is almoſt a continued Diſturbance in the Waters, by reaſon of what they call Two Tides meeting; which I take to be no more than the Sets of the Currents from the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt, and from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shore: this they call <hi>Portland Race</hi>; and ſeveral Ships, not aware of theſe Currents, have been embay'd to the Weſt of <hi>Portland,</hi> and driven on Shore on the Beach, (of which I ſhall ſpeak preſently) where they have been loſt.</p>
            <p>To prevent this Danger, and guide the Mariner in theſe Diſtreſſes, they have ſet up Two Light-houſes on the Two Points of that Iſland, which are very uſeful and ſerviceable to Ships.</p>
            <p>This Iſland, tho' ſeemingly miſerable, and thinly inhabited, yet the Inhabitants being almoſt all Stone-cutters, we found there were no very poor People among them; and when they collected Money for the rebuilding St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, they got more in this Iſland than in the great Town of <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' <hi>Portland</hi> ſtands a League from the main Land of <hi>Britain,</hi> yet it is almoſt join'd by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Riff of Beach, that is to ſay, of ſmall Stones caſt up by the Sea, which runs from the Iſland ſo near the Shore of <hi>England,</hi> that they ferry over with a Boat and a Rope, the Water not being above half a Stone's-throw over; and the ſaid Riff of Beach ending, as it were, at that Inlet of Water, turns away Weſt, and runs parallel with the Shore quite to <hi>Abbotſbury,</hi> a Town about Seven Miles beyond <hi>Weymouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I name this to explain what I ſaid before, of Ships being embay'd and loſt here: this is when, coming
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0141100401:305"/>
from the Weſtward, they omit to keep a good <hi>Offing,</hi> or are taken ſhort by contrary Winds, and cannot weather the high Land of <hi>Portland</hi>; but are driven between <hi>Portland</hi> and the main Land, and run on Shore on that vaſt Beach.</p>
            <p>On the Inſide of this Beach, and between it and the Land, is the ſaid Inlet of Water, which they ferry over, as above, to paſs and repaſs to and from <hi>Portland.</hi> This Inlet opens at about Two Miles Weſt, grows very broad, and makes a kind of Lake within the Land of a Mile and a half broad, and near Three Miles in Length, the Breadth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. At the fartheſt End Weſt of this Water is a large Decoy, and the Verge of the Water well grown with Wood, and proper Groves of Trees for Cover for the Fowl. In the open Lake, or broad Part, is a continual Aſſembly of Swans: here they live, feed and breed; and the Number of them is ſuch, that, I believe, I did not ſee ſo few as 7 or 8000. We ſaw ſeveral of them upon the Wing, very high in the Air; whence we ſuppoſed, they flew over the Riff of Beach, which parts the Lake from the Sea, to feed on the Shores.</p>
            <p>From this Decoy Weſt, the Lake narrows, and at laſt almoſt cloſes, till the Beach joins the Shore; and ſo <hi>Portland</hi> may be ſaid not to be an Iſland, but Part of the Continent. And now we came to <hi>Abbotſbury,</hi> a Town antiently famous for a great Monaſtery, and now eminent for nothing but its Ruins.</p>
            <p>From hence we went on to <hi>Bridport,</hi> a pretty large, but not well-built Corporation Town on the Sea Shore: here we ſaw Boats all the way on the Shore fiſhing for Mackerel, which they take in the eaſieſt manner imaginable, and in ſuch prodigious Plenty, that there has been a Watch ſet to prevent Farmers dunging their Land with them, which, it was thought, might be apt to infect the Air.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0141100401:306"/>In the Year 1722 an Act paſſed for reſtoring and rebuilding the Haven and Piers of <hi>Bridport,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring it to its antient flouriſhing State; for heretofore it was a Place of great Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; but by reaſon of a great Sickneſs, which formerly ſwept away the greateſt Part of its moſt wealthy Inhabitants, and by other Accidents, the Haven became neglected, and choaked with Sands; the Piers fell to Ruin, and the Town, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to Decay; ſo that there was no Security for Ships that happened to be driven by Streſs of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the deep and dangerous Bay, wherein the Haven formerly was, which occaſioned frequent Shipwrecks. The Act therefore authorizes the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs and Burgeſſes of <hi>Bridport</hi> to levy certain Tolls and Duties on divers Merchandizes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in order to reſtore the ſaid Piers and Harbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bridport</hi> was formerly the only Place for twiſting of Ropes for the Royal Navy: and it is ſtill uſed for that Purpoſe, the neighbouring Lands yielding plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Hemp.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Bridport</hi> we came to <hi>Lyme,</hi> a Town par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly made famous by the Landing of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth, June</hi> 11. 1685, in the Time of King <hi>James</hi> II. with only Twelve Men. Many of his Party were afterwards put to Death on the Spot, and their Limbs hung up in the Town. Before that Time the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> ſet Footing here in his Tour to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is called <hi>Lyme-Regis:</hi> it is a Town of good Figure, and has in it ſeveral eminent Merchants, who carry on a conſiderable Trade to <hi>France, Spain, Newfoundland,</hi> and the <hi>Streights</hi>; and tho' they have neither Creek or Bay, Road or River, they have a good Harbour; and ſuch as is not in all <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> beſides, if in the World.</p>
            <p>It is a maſſy Pile of Building, conſiſting of high and thick Walls of Stone, raiſed, at firſt, with all
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0141100401:307"/>
the Methods that Art could deviſe, and maintain'd now with very little Difficulty: the Walls are raiſed in the main Sea, at a good Diſtance from the Shore. It conſiſts of one main and ſolid Wall of Stone, large enough for Carts and Carriages to paſs on the Top, and to admit Houſes and Ware-houſes to be built on it; ſo that it is broad as a Street. Oppoſite to this, but farther into the Sea, is another Wall of the ſame Workmanſhip, which croſſes the End of the firſt, and comes about with a Tail, parallel to that.</p>
            <p>Between the Point of the firſt or main Wall, is the Entrance into the Port; and the ſecond or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Wall breaking the Violence of the Sea from the Entrance, the Ships go into the Baſin, and ride there as ſecure as in a Mill-pond, or Wet-dock.</p>
            <p>This Work is call'd the <hi>Cobb:</hi> the Cuſtom-houſe Officers have a Lodge and Ware-houſe upon it. It might be ſtrengthen'd with a Fort, and the Walls themſelves are firm enough to carry what Guns they pleaſe to plant upon it; but they did not ſeem to think it needful: and as the Shore is convenient for Batteries, they have ſome Guns planted in proper Places, for the Defence of the <hi>Cobb,</hi> and the Town.</p>
            <p>This Town is under the Government of a Mayor and Aldermen, and may paſs for a Place of Wealth, conſidering the Bigneſs of it. Here we found the Merchants began to trade in the Pilchard Fiſhing, tho' not to ſo conſiderable a Degree as they do farther Weſt; the Pilchards ſeldom coming up ſo high Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as <hi>Portland,</hi> and not very often ſo high as <hi>Lyme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I viſited from hence ſome of the Towns in the North-weſt Part of this Country, as <hi>Blandford,</hi> on the River <hi>Stour,</hi> in the Road between <hi>Saliſbury</hi> and <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> a handſome well-built Town, pleaſantly ſeated in a Flexure of the River, before charming
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0141100401:308"/>
Meadows, and rich Lands. Wood thrives exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly here. Indeed this County is a fine Variety of Downs, Woods, Lawns, Arable and Paſture Land, rich Valleys, and an excellent Air. The dry Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Winds, the cold Northern, and the Weſtern Moiſture, are temper'd by the warm Southern ſaline Breezes, waſted hither from the Ocean. But <hi>Bland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> is chiefly famous for making the fineſt Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in <hi>England,</hi> where they ſhewed me, in my firſt Viſit to it, ſome ſo exquiſitely fine, as I think I never ſaw better in <hi>Flanders, France,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> and which they ſaid they rated at above 30<hi>l.</hi> Sterling a Yard.</p>
            <p>This was the State and the Trade of the Town, when I was there in my firſt Journey: but <hi>June</hi> 4. 1731, the whole Town, except Twenty-ſix Houſes, was conſumed by Fire, together with the Church. The Conſternation of the People was ſo great, and the Fire ſo furious, that few ſaved any Goods.</p>
            <p>An Act paſſed in 1732, for the better and more eaſy Rebuilding of this Town, and for determining Differences touching Houſes and Buildings burnt down or demoliſhed therein; and as ſeveral wiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations were made by it, <hi>Blandford</hi> now makes a much better Appearance than ever.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Blandford</hi> I went Weſt to <hi>Stourbridge,</hi> which, and the Country round, is employ'd in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of Stockens; it was once famous for making the fineſt, beſt, and higheſt-pric'd knit Stockens in <hi>England</hi>; but that Trade is much decay'd, by the Increaſe of the Knitting-ſtocken Engine, or Frame. which has deſtroyed the Hand Knitting-trade for fine Stockens thro' the whole Kingdom, of which I ſhall ſpeak in another Place.</p>
            <p>From hence I came to <hi>Shireburn,</hi> a large and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Town, with One Collegiate or Conventual Church, and may juſtly claim to have more Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants in it than any Town in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> tho' it is
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0141100401:309"/>
neither the County Town, nor ſends Members to Parliament. It was once a Biſhop's See, which was removed to <hi>Saliſbury.</hi> The Church is ſtill a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Pile, and ſhews the Face of great Antiquity. Here begins the <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Medley Cloathing, tho' this Town be in <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi>; of which I ſhall ſpeak at large in its Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shafteſbury</hi> is alſo on the Edge of this County, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> and <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> being Fourteen Miles from <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> over that fine Down or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet Ground, call'd <hi>Saliſbury-plain.</hi> It is not an extraordinary Town; but ſituated upon the Top of a high Hill, and which cloſes the Plain or Downs, and whence a new Scene is preſented, (<hi>viz.</hi>) a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Somerſet</hi> and <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> where 'tis all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, and grown with Woods, Foreſts, and planted Hedge-Rows; the Country rich, fertile and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, the Towns and Houſes ſtanding thick, and being large and full of Inhabitants, and thoſe Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants fully employ'd in the richeſt and moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Manufacture in the World, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloathing, as well the Medley, or mix'd Cloathing, as Whites, both for the Home and foreign Trade; on which I ſhall be more particular in my Return thro' the Weſt and North Part of <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shafteſbury</hi> has however lately received ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements from the Generoſity of a neighbouring Gentleman, and particularly in a fine Plantation on the Top of <hi>Park-Hill</hi>; which he was ſo kind as to indulge the Inhabitants with for a Place of Walking and Diverſion; but attempting, on the Strength of his good Offices to the Town, to preſcribe to them in the Choice of a Member of Parliament, he has not met with the grateful Return he might have expected, Violence having been done to the very Plantation he had ſo generouſly devoted to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service and Pleaſure of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0141100401:310"/>In my Return to my Weſtern Progreſs, I paſs'd ſome little Part of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> as thro' <hi>Evil,</hi> or <hi>Yeovil,</hi> upon the River <hi>Ivil</hi>; in going to which we deſcend a long ſteep Hill, called <hi>Babylon-hill</hi>; but from what Original, I could find none of the Country People able to inform me.</p>
            <p>Northward upon an high ſandy Hill, by the Bank of the River <hi>Ivel,</hi> is a <hi>Roman</hi> Camp called <hi>Cheſterton</hi>; under which lies the Town of <hi>Sandy,</hi> the <hi>Salinae</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where abundance of <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Antiquities have been found, and immenſe Quantities of Coins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yeovil</hi> is a Market-town of good Reſort, and ſome little Cloathing is carried on, in and near it. Its main Manufacture at this Time is Gloves. It deals alſo in Corn, Cheeſe, Hemp, and all Sorts of Proviſions.</p>
            <p>It cannot paſs my Obſervation here, that when we are come this Length from <hi>London,</hi> the Dialect of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, or the Country way of expreſſing themſelves, is not eaſily underſtood. It is true, that it is ſo in many Parts of <hi>England</hi> beſides, but in none in ſo groſs a Degree as in this Part. As this Way of booriſh Speech is in <hi>Ireland</hi> called the Brogue upon the Tongue, ſo here 'tis named <hi>Jouring.</hi> It is not poſſible to explain this fully by Writing, becauſe the Difference is not ſo much in the Orthography, as in the Tone and Accent; their abridging the Speech, <hi>Cham,</hi> for <hi>I am; Chill,</hi> for <hi>I will; Don,</hi> for <hi>do on,</hi> or <hi>put on</hi>; and <hi>Doff,</hi> for <hi>do off,</hi> or <hi>put off</hi>; and the like.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Evil</hi> or <hi>Yeovil</hi> we came to <hi>Crookorn,</hi> thence to <hi>Chard,</hi> which immediately brought me into <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be unacceptable here to inſert a general Deſcription of this large County, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to the Reader ſome Idea of the Nature of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0141100401:311"/>
Soil, its Productions, and the Method of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as the Manufactures, and Merchandizes, on which the Trading Part of the Inhabitants ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>To begin then: The Weſtern Part of the County bordering on <hi>Cornwall, viz.</hi> about <hi>Tavyſtock, Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtow, Oakhampton, Holſworthy, Bideford, Great Torrington, Chulmleigh, Chagford, Moreton, Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> and all round the Skirts of <hi>Dartmore,</hi> as well as that large Foreſt itſelf, conſiſts of a very coarſe, moory, or fenny Soil, very barren in its Nature; in ſome Places productive of nothing but a dwarf Kind of Furze of little or no Value. At other Places grow nothing but Ruſhes, or a coarſe, four Kind of Paſturage, which the Cattle will not feed upon; and therefore it dries up and withers into a Sedge. The Soil here is generally a ſtiff Clay, thro' which the Water cannot ſoak away: this renders it very unhealthy, eſpecially to Sheep, which in thoſe Parts are of a ſmall Kind, and very ſubject to the Rot, which (in wet Seaſons eſpecially) deſtroys them in great Numbers: and what adds to the Malady is, that neither the Induſtry of the Huſbandman (for which this County is deſervely famous) nor any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt that has yet been found out, will to any purpoſe cure this Sterility.</p>
            <p>The principal, and indeed the only profitable Return that the Inhabitants can make out of thoſe Lands, is by breeding Black Cattle, for which they are very well adapted; for here are bred thoſe fine Oxen, in great Numbers, which, by the Drovers of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and thereabouts, are brought up, and in their flat Feeding Lands, betwixt <hi>Bridge-water</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> (which I have ſeen almoſt covered with them) fattened fit for <hi>Smithfield</hi> Market, where they drive, and ſell them to the <hi>Londoners,</hi> who have not ſo good Beef from any other Part of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0141100401:312"/>The Northern Parts of the County are of a quite different Nature from the former; for this generally conſiſts of a dry healthy Soil, eſpecially about <hi>Ilford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe, South Moulton, Dulverton,</hi> and all along the Brim of the Foreſt of <hi>Exmore.</hi> Thoſe Downs are far from being a luxuriant Feeding, but are very good Grazing for Sheep; and being well dreſſed with Lime, (which is brought over hither by Water from <hi>Wales</hi>) Dung, Sand, and other Compoſt, manured by the indefatigable Labour of the Inhabitants, produce tolerable Crops of Corn. I ſay <hi>tolerable</hi> ones; for tho' they far exceed the Productions in <hi>Dorſet, Wilts, Hants,</hi> &amp;c. (where Sluggiſhneſs ſo far prevails as to leave Dame Nature deſtitute of the leaſt human Aſſiſtance) the Fertility is by no means comparable to that of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Middle</hi> Parts of the County, in the <hi>former</hi> of which a rich Marl, in ſome Parts, and a fertile, ſandy Soil in others; and in the <hi>latter</hi> a fat, ſtrong Soil, of a deep-red Colour, intermixed with Veins of different Kinds of Loam, produce very great Crops of Corn, and Peaſe of the beſt Kind, not to be excelled in the whole Iſland. Neither doth it fall behind in Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Ground, and Paſturage, Clover, Eaver, and Trefoil Graſs, and Turneps; as is evident to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who goes thro' any of the Markets, and beholds the fine, well-fed Beef and Mutton, with which they are plentifully ſtored.</p>
            <p>About <hi>Teingmouth, Dartmouth, Totnes, Modbury, Plymouth, Aſhburton,</hi> and all the South Parts of the County, (called the <hi>South-Hams</hi>) the Lands are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of a different Kind from any of the former; in moſt Places very good for Arable and Paſture, but eſpecially for Cyder Fruits. A great Part of this large Track lies on a <hi>Stratum</hi> of Marble, which the Inhabitants break up, and burn into Lime; and therewith dreſs their Lands, to their very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. Neither is this all the Advantage they
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0141100401:313"/>
make of thoſe Quarries; for in many of them is found Stone, which for its Hardneſs, Soundneſs, and beautiful Veinings, rivals the beſt <hi>Italian</hi> Marbles, and falls very little, if any thing, ſhort of them in Luſtre. Great Quantities of this Stone are ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and other Places, where they are wrought up for the nobleſt Purpoſes. At other Places on this South-coaſt, are Quarries of Slate, for covering Houſes, and this likewiſe of the beſt Kind; which are not only fetched away by Land-carriage, to the Diſtance of Ten, Twelve, and Sixteen Miles, but great Quantities of them are ſent Coaſt-wiſe, to all the Towns on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Shore; and exported to <hi>Holland, Flanders,</hi> and other Places beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>The Reader will not, by this Deſcription, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Lands in any Part of the County are all one and the ſame Kind; Downs, Fens, Rocks, and Wood-grounds, are interſperſed among the beſt Lands; as there are alſo ſome good Arable and Paſture, amongſt the moſt deſolate and barren; and whoever looks round him in his own Situation, will know in what Senſe to take this general Deſcription. To proceed:</p>
            <p>At divers Places are found large Quantities of very good Oak Timber, as well as Aſh, Elm, Beech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch of it as grows in Places whence it can be convey'd either by Land or Water-carriage, to <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Dock, are there ſerved in for the Uſe of his Majeſty's Navy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coppice-wood</hi> is ſo very plenty, that altho' the Woollen Manufacturers take off great Quantities in Charcoal, and yet greater Quantities are expended in common Firing, (there being no Coal raiſed in this County) yet the Price is ſo low, that the Lands where it thrives well, will not generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more than 5<hi>s. per</hi> Acre <hi>(communibus annis).</hi> The Lands in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> ſave only the Foreſt of <hi>Dartmore, Hallden-hill,</hi> and ſome Heaths, Moors,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0141100401:314"/>
and coarſe Downs of no very large Extent, (which, for the moſt part, are not capable of Improvement, not even by <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Huſbandry) are divided into ſmall Incloſures, and (in Places where any Shrubs will grow) by quickſet Hedges, banked up Four or Five Feet high with Earth. And as the Incloſures are ſmall, ſo are the Farms or Tenements in theſe Parts, even to a very manifeſt Inconvenience: for the general Method here is, for Gentlemen to leaſe out the Tenements of their Manors for 99 Years, determinable on Three Lives; taking Fines for ſuch Leaſes, and reſerving no more than about One Shilling in the Pound of the yearly Value.</p>
            <p>By this means, Men of ſmall Fortunes find an Opportunity to lay out the little Money they have, in what they call <hi>Purchaſing an Eſtate,</hi> which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſerves for a Settlement upon a Wife, for the Money ſhe brings. Hence a Family comes on, and craves a Maintenance out of a Farm of perhaps 20<hi>l.</hi> a Year; which ſurely can produce but a very poor one: whereas 2 or 300<hi>l.</hi> ſunk in this Purchaſe, would have enabled him to manage a Farm of 200<hi>l.</hi> a Year; out of which, by Induſtry and good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, the Family might not only live in a more plentiful manner, the Children be better educated, and inſtructed to underſtand the Buſineſs of the Farm; but Money likewiſe laid up every Year to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſetting them out in the ſame Method of living. This I take to be the principal Cauſe of the Poverty and Hardſhip that appears in Country Places, and of the Difficulty of getting a good Tenant at Rack-rent, for any Farm whoſe Value exceeds 100<hi>l.</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have mentioned, that in my Way to <hi>Chard,</hi> I paſſed thro' <hi>Axminſter,</hi> a pretty conſiderable Market-town, and the firſt in the County of <hi>Devon.</hi> The great Weſtern Road to <hi>London</hi> goes thro' this Town. Here my Curioſity led me to go into the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0141100401:315"/>
Church, and view the Monuments of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes (or rather the Biſhop of <hi>Sherburne</hi> and Two Dukes) who were ſlain at the Battle of <hi>Brunaburgh</hi> in that Neighbourhood, fought by King <hi>Athelſtane</hi> with Seven <hi>Daniſh</hi> Princes; over whom he obtained the Victory, in a Field thence called <hi>King's-field</hi> to this Day. The Monuments of thoſe <hi>Saxon</hi> Worthies were under Arches in the Walls of the Church, Two of which have been lately filled up.</p>
            <p>Here, in Memory of the Victory, King <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtane</hi> founded a Minſter for Seven Prieſts, which in After-ages were reduced to Two; for whom a Portion of Land was allotted called <hi>Prieſt-aller,</hi> which, with the Parſonage, now belongs to Two Prebendaries of the Church of <hi>York.</hi> The Manor continued in the Crown till the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> who gave it to the Lord <hi>Brewer,</hi> a Daughter and Coheir of which Family <hi>(Alicia)</hi> brought it in Marriage to Lord <hi>Mobun</hi> of <hi>Dunſtar,</hi> whoſe Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with Conſent of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. <hi>Anno Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> 1246. 8. <hi>Id.

               <hi>Ford Abbey</hi> is in this Neighbourhood, heretofore a ſtately Fabrick, lofty and very magnificent, adorned with curious Carvings and Embelliſhments of the <hi>Gothick</hi> kind, ſome of whoſe Beauties ſtill remain, as may be ſeen in a modern Print thereof, publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Buck.</hi> It was firſt founded by <hi>Adeliza,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Baldwin de Brioniis,</hi> Baron of <hi>Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton, Anno</hi> 1140, and dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> for <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Monks: At the Surrender it was valued at 381<hi>l.</hi> 10<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> Half-penny, yearly.</p>

            <p>At <hi>Northleigh,</hi> or rather, at <hi>Uplime,</hi> (which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was formerly the Inheritance of the Abbey of <hi>Glaſtonbury</hi>) was born Mr. <hi>Nathanael Carpenter,</hi> the Author of the Treatiſe of Geography, and divers others Tracts that bear his Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cullyford,</hi> in this Neighbourhood, was the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> who in 1609, bound to <hi>Virginia,</hi> (of which Colony he was then made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor) was in a violent Tempeſt ſhipwreck'd, and with Sir <hi>George Somers</hi> caſt on Shore, by which Accident they were made the firſt Poſſeſſors of the Iſland of <hi>Bermudas,</hi> or <hi>Summer Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Track abounds with Lands, which were formerly appropriated to Churches and Religious Houſes; <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Smallridge, Axmouth, Farwood, Salcombe, Dunkerwell,</hi> (a Monaſtery of <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Monks) <hi>Sidbury, Sidmouth, Branſcombe, Monketon, Luppit, Awlſcombe,</hi> and at divers other Places; which from the Richneſs of the Soil makes good the Obſervation, That the Religious of thoſe Days, made it their chief Endeavour to poſſeſs themſelves of the beſt Things of this World.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Tidwell,</hi> alias <hi>Tideſwell,</hi> is a Pond or Pool, which boils up like that of the ſame Name at <hi>Weeden,</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire.</hi> The ſame Road I was before in, brought me from <hi>Axminſter</hi> to <hi>Honiton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a large and beautiful Market-town, very populous and well-built; and is ſo very remarkably paved with ſmall Pebbles, that on both Sides the Way a little Chanel is left ſhouldered up; ſo that it holds a ſmall Stream of fine clear running Water, with a little ſquare Dipping-place left at every Door; ſo that every Family in the Town has a clear clean running Rivulet (as it may be called) juſt at their
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0141100401:317"/>
own Door; and this is much finer, pleaſanter, and more agreeable to look on, than that at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which they ſo much boaſt of.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee the firſt of the Serge-manufacture of <hi>Devonſhire</hi>; a Trade too great to be deſcribed in Miniature. It takes up this whole County, which is the largeſt and moſt populous in <hi>England, Yorkſhire</hi> excepted; but <hi>Devonſhire</hi> is ſo full of great Towns, and thoſe Towns ſo full of People, and thoſe People ſo univerſally employ'd in Trade and Manufactures, that it cannot be equall'd in <hi>England,</hi> nor perhaps in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honiton</hi> ſtands in the beſt and pleaſanteſt Part of the whole County; and I cannot but recommend it to Gentlemen who travel this Road, that if they obſerve the Proſpect at <hi>Honiton</hi> for half a Mile, till they come down the Hill, and to the very Entrance into <hi>Honiton,</hi> the View of the Country is the moſt beautiful Landſkip in the World, and I do not remember the like in any one Place in <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis obſervable, that the Market of this Town was kept originally on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> till it was changed by the Direction of King <hi>John.</hi> This Town is now much employ'd in the Trade of Lace-making.</p>
            <p>On the Road from <hi>Honiton</hi> they have a beautiful Proſpect almoſt all the Way to <hi>Exeter,</hi> which is 12 Miles.</p>
            <p>On the Left-hand of this Road lies the Town of <hi>St. Mary Ottery,</hi> ſo called, as ſome ſay, from the River <hi>Otter,</hi> and that from the Otters found formerly in it. This Town was given by King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi> to the Church of <hi>St. Mary</hi> at <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi>; but was afterwards bought by <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who made of it a Quarter College in 10 <hi>Edward</hi> III. and therein placed ſecular Prieſts, with other Miniſters, to whom he gave the whole Manor, Pariſh, Tythes, Fines, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Profits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which amounted to 304<hi>l.</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 10<hi>s.</hi> yearly.</p>

               <hi>Bicton,</hi> formerly <hi>Bicheton,</hi> was given by <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> to one of his Servants, called <hi>William Porto.</hi> It afterwards reverted to the Crown, and by <hi>Henry</hi> I. was given to one <hi>John Janitor,</hi> ſo called from his Office; for by his Tenure, he was to keep the Priſon for this County, by which Service it is held to this Day, by the worthy Owner thereof <hi>Henry Rolle,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who is at this time Knight of this Shire. His Anceſtor, Sir <hi>Henry Rolle,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had it by Marriage with <hi>Anne,</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>Thomas Dennis,</hi> to whoſe Family it came from the before-mentioned <hi>Janitor,</hi> thro' <hi>Balliſter, Sackville,</hi> and <hi>Copleſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we came to <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Capital of the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> a City which hath often changed its Name: for it was the <hi>Pen-Caer</hi> and <hi>Caer-Eske</hi> of the <hi>Britons</hi>; the <hi>Auguſta</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi>; the <hi>Iſca</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>; the <hi>Iſca-Damnoniorum</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine</hi>; the <hi>Exanceſter</hi> of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> which was afterwards abreviated to <hi>Exceſter</hi> and <hi>Exeter,</hi> from the great Number of Monks there. It had for ſome time the Name of <hi>Monketon,</hi> but at length, from that large River which waſhes its Walls, and bears the Name of <hi>Exe,</hi> (whether from the Foreſt of that Name where it riſes, or the Foreſt from it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine) it retains that of <hi>Exeter,</hi> which it ſeems now to be varying for <hi>Exon.</hi> It was firſt fortified with a Stone Wall (which ſtill remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire) by King <hi>Athelſtane</hi>; and was for ſome time the Seat of the <hi>Weſt-Saxon</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Romans</hi> were here, is highly probable, among other Proofs, from their Coins, that have been dug up at divers Places: in particular, a Gold one of <hi>Nero</hi> at <hi>Exeter</hi>; one of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> near <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaple</hi>; ſeveral Silver ones of <hi>Severus,</hi> and other Emperors; but eſpecially from a great Quantity of them dug up about Twenty Years ſince at <hi>Exeter,</hi> within the Cloſe, together with the Urn in which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0141100401:319"/>
they were buried. I ſaw a great Number of thoſe, ſome of which were of Silver; but the greateſt Part of them were a Mixture of Tin and Copper; they had the Impreſſion of <hi>Gordianus, Philippus,</hi> and other Emperors.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Athelſtane</hi> founded here a Monaſtery to St. <hi>Mary</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for Monks of the Order of St. <hi>Benedict.</hi> The Chapel of <hi>St. Mary</hi> now fitted up for a Library, and furniſhed with a pretty great Number of Books, (which are but of little Uſe, becauſe placed in a very confuſed Order) is the very Eaſtermoſt Part of the Cathedral, and was doubtleſs the firſt Beginning of that now handſome Fabrick. King <hi>Etheldred</hi> founded alſo, within the Cloſe, a Houſe for Monks, and another for Nuns. Divers other Religious Houſes, as the Priories of <hi>St. James, St. Nicolas, St. John Baptiſt</hi>; the <hi>Grey Fryers,</hi> &amp;c. were the Work of After-ages.</p>
            <p>The Walls are in pretty good Repair, and make a Walk round the City, with the Pleaſure of ſeeing a fine Country on oppoſite Hills, full of Wood, rich Ground, Orchards, Villages, and Gentlemens Houſes. The Beauty of the Place conſiſts of one long Street, called <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> broad and ſtrait. The Houſes are of a very old, but good Model, ſpacious, commodious, and not inelegant. This Street is full of Shops well furniſhed, and all ſorts of Trades look briſk. The People are induſtrious and courteous: the Fair Sex are truly ſuch, as well as numerous; their Complexion, and generally their Hair, of a fair Caſt: they are genteel, diſengaged, of eaſy Carriage, and good Mien. There has been of late a vaſt Increaſe of Buildings within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City. The Situation renders it of Neceſſity clean, dry and airy. The Soil thither from <hi>Honyton</hi> is rather ſandy than ſtony; whence it muſt needs be very healthful. There are many Bookſellers. In Dr. <hi>Muſgrave</hi>'s Garden an Head of the Empreſs
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0141100401:320"/>
               <hi>Julia Domna,</hi> of a Coloſſean Size, was dug up. The Head-dreſs is ſuitable to thoſe Times; and neither the Manner nor Carving are deſpicable, tho' the Graver has not done it Juſtice. 'Tis the nobleſt Relique of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Antiquity which we know of this Sort: 'tis 21 Inches from the Top of the Attire to the Chin, and belonged to a Statue of 12 Feet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, originally ſet upon ſome Temple or Palace. There is alſo an Inſcription of <hi>Camillus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Country remarkably abounds with Perſons afflicted with the Gout; which is attributed to the Cuſtom of marling the Lands with Lime, and the great Uſe of poor, ſweet Cyder, eſpecially among the meaner People.</p>
            <p>In the Northern Angle of the City, and higheſt Ground, ſtands <hi>Rugemont-caſtle,</hi> once the Reſidence of the <hi>Weſt-Saxon</hi> Monarchs, afterwards of the Earls of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> 'Tis of a ſquariſh Figure, not very large, inviron'd with a high Wall, and deep Ditch. It has a Rampire of Earth parallel to the Top of the Wall, forming a Terrace, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks the City and Country. Here are the Aſſize-houſe, and a Chapel.</p>
            <p>The Bridge over the <hi>Exe</hi> is of great Length, and has Houſes on both Sides, and at both Ends, with a conſiderable Vacancy in the Middle. In the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> are the Pictures of General <hi>Monk,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Henrietta-Maria.</hi>

            <p>The Biſhop's See of this Weſtern Dioceſe hath had ſeveral Removes; for it was firſt at <hi>Bodmyn</hi> for the County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and ſince that at <hi>Tawton</hi> for this County. Afterwards both were joined and placed at <hi>Crediton.</hi> And laſtly, about the Year 1050, King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> and his Queen <hi>Edyth,</hi> inthroned <hi>Leofricus</hi> (who had been Three Years Biſhop of <hi>Crediton)</hi> into the See of <hi>Exeter,</hi> in the following very ſolemn manner:</p>

The Form of Words thus:</p>

            <p>The Church was about 400 Years in building, and very remarkable it is to behold the Uniformity with which it was carried on; for nobody can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the leaſt Incongruity in the Parts; ſo much is it like the Workmanſhip of one and the ſame Architect.</p>
            <p>There are ſome antient funeral Monuments in the Cathedral; but firſt, as Matter of the greateſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, let me take notice of the Biſhop's Throne in the Choir, which, at the Diſſolution of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy in King <hi>Charles</hi> I.'s Time was (as a uſeleſs Thing) taken down; but whether the Workman imploy'd to do it were well affected to that Order, or elſe had ſome private Inſtructions from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body in Power, who foreſaw that it would ſome time or other be of Uſe again, certain it is, that a great deal of Care was taken of the Materials; for it is now replaced, and every Part of it as ſound and good as when firſt made. The <hi>Gothick</hi> Carvings about the Canopy are at leaſt 60 Feet high, and a vaſt deal of good Workmanſhip (of that Kind)
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0141100401:322"/>
there is about it: it is, I believe, coeval with the See.</p>
            <p>The antique Monuments, as I before mentioned, to be ſeen here, are particularly thoſe of <hi>Humphry Bohun</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford, Hugh Courtenay,</hi> Earl of <hi>Devon,</hi> and his Lady; the Lord <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Peter Carew,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Speke,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Stapleton, Dowrich</hi> of <hi>Dowrich</hi>; the Biſhops <hi>Leofricus, Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Branſcombe, Oldham, Bradbridge, Lacy, Cary,</hi> and others, eſpecially that of Biſhop <hi>Stapleton,</hi> the pious Founder of <hi>Exeter-college</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi>; which Society, in grateful Remembrance of their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, have lately repaired and beautified his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in regard to ſome of the Carvings about it, exceſs any thing I ever ſaw of ſo old a Date in the <hi>Gothick</hi> way.</p>
            <p>The Altar-piece, done 100 Years ago, is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Inſide of the Church in Perſpective, an exquiſitely fine Piece of Painting, and (excepting only a little Injury it received from the Swords of the Saints Militant in the great Rebellion) exceedingly well preſerved. The fine painted Glaſs, of which there is a great deal, underwent the Fury of the ſame pious Reformers, who after they had made a forcible Entry, and <q rend="inline">"taken to themſelves <hi>this</hi> Houſe of God in Poſſeſſion,"</q> under the Umbrage of an Ordinance of Parliament of the 28th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1643, broke out the beſt of thoſe Paintings, and irretrievably ruined all the Scripture Hiſtory therein repreſented: neither was their Rage confined to thoſe brittle Materials; for the carved Figures of the Patriarchs, Prophets, Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which there were a great many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Objects of their furious Zeal and Ignorance; for there the maimed Bodies are now to be ſeen, ſome without the Head; others have loſt one or both Legs, or Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of them ſome way or other mangled. And having by this means taken away what they feared would draw them into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, they
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0141100401:323"/>
divided this Cathedral by a Partition-wall betwixt the Choir and the main Body of it, one of which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions was made uſe of by an Independent, and the other by a Preſbyterian Congregation.</p>
            <p>And now, that I am taking notice of the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this magnificent Piece of Antiquity, let me juſt mention, that in one of its Towers is a very large Bell of about Sixty hundred Weight; and, in the other, a fine Ring of Ten large ones. An Organ of very good Workmanſhip, and ſupported by a Tetra-ſtyle of very beautiful <hi>Gothick</hi> Columns, ſtands where the before-mentioned Partition-wall did. The largeſt Pipes in this Inſtrument are of a great Length, and 15 Inches in Diameter, which is ſaid to be Two Inches more than thoſe at <hi>Ulm,</hi> which is ſo famed for its Largeneſs.</p>
            <p>The well-finiſhed Alcove of modern Work, for the Biſhop, and the Pulpit, and Pews of the like, in the Nave or Body of the Church, together with the neat Marble Font, and the Two Suits of Hangings for the Choir, one of Tapeſtry, and the other of Velvet, and the fine Suit of gilt Plate for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Service, is all that I ſhall further add about the grave and well-adapted Ornaments and Furniture of this Temple, or Houſe of God.</p>
            <p>To complete this Deſcription with a Circumſtance which I think ought by no means to be paſſed over: The Solemnity, Decency, and affecting Harmony, with which the Service, and Muſick vocal and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, is generally performed, by the Choral-vicars, Organiſt, and Choriſters; and (which is well worthy of Imitation<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis no uncommon Thing to ſee 500 People here in a Morning, which is at leaſt five times as many as uſually attend at <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s, or any other Six o'clock Chapel I was ever at: And 'tis commendable, that the <hi>Reader</hi> doth not here curtail the Morning Service, by leaving out any Part thereof, as in other Places they do. Here are Two Morning Lectures preached weekly; <hi>viz. Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> Mornings.</note>) the numerous Congregation, which,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0141100401:324"/>
Winter and Summer, attend the daily Prayers at Six in the Morning; and their grave and pious Behaviour there; I ſay, all this together, render this Cathedral a Glory to the Dioceſe, the Envy of other Choirs, and the Admiration of Strangers.</p>
            <p>Other antique Buildings of a publick Nature are the Chapter-houſe and Cloiſters, the Biſhop's Palace, the Houſes belonging to the Dean, the Chancellor, Treaſurer, and other Dignitaries of the Church; the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> the Walls, and Gates of the City, with thoſe of the Caſtle, and the Cloſe; the Hoſpital of <hi>St. John the Baptiſt,</hi> 20 Pariſh Churches within the City and Liberties thereof, the Bridge over the River <hi>Exe,</hi> a large and very handſome Conduit for Water, in the Centre of the Four principal Streets; to which may be added, ſome Chapels and Alms-houſes yet ſtanding, and the Ruins of divers others; which are Monuments of the Piety of their Founders, and the Impiety of thoſe who neglect them.</p>
            <p>Modern Buildings of a publick Nature this City hath not many to boaſt of: <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s, (one of the Twenty Churches before-mentioned) the Chancellor's Houſe, a very handſome and well contrived Work-houſe for the Poor, Three or Four Meeting-houſes, a Quay for landing Goods, and a Cuſtom-houſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all that have been erected within 40 Years paſt.</p>
            <p>The Civil Government of this City is by a Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-council; a Recorder, Sheriff, Four Stewards, a Chamberlain, and Town-clerk, who are attended by a Sword-bearer, who wears the Cap, and carries the Sword given by King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. before them to Church, and on all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Proceſſions; Four Serjeants at Mace, and as many Staff-bearers; the former in Gowns, and the latter in Liveries, with Badges; and, which adds not a little to their Splendor, they keep a Band of Four Muſicians in conſtant Pay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0141100401:325"/>There are, moreover, Twelve Companies of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated Trades, who, on publick Occaſions, and on Gaudy-days, walk in the Mayor's Train, dreſſed in Gowns, each Company having a Beadle, in a laced Cloak, bearing the Enſigns of their ſeveral Profeſſions, to uſher them.</p>
            <p>For ſupplying the Inhabitants with Water, there is brought-in a pretty large Quantity by ſubterraneous Pipes, from ſome Springs in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Sidwell,</hi> without <hi>Eaſt-gate,</hi> Part of which is repoſited for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſe in the Conduit before-mentioned, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Part is conveyed to the Houſes of the Biſhop, Dean, Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within the Cloſe, and to a common Pump, juſt at the Weſt Entrance of the Cathedral. But all this would be far ſhort of a ſufficient Supply, and therefore an exceeding good Engine is fixed in the River, the great Wheel of which working by the ſame Water, forces the River Water thro' Elm-trees bored for that Purpoſe, into a large Reſervoir, fixed about 20 Feet above Ground, in the higheſt Part of the City adjoining to the <hi>Guildhall</hi>; from whence, thro' other Pipes, it is diſperſed to all Parts of the City in great Plenty. The Expence of which, to each Houſe-keeper that will have it, is from 15 to 30<hi>s.</hi> a Year, according to the Quantity their Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions require.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Exe</hi> was, heretofore, in its main Stream navigable to the Walls of the City; but, on a Difference between the Mayor, and the then Earl of <hi>Devon,</hi> on a very trifling Occaſion; <hi>viz.</hi> Which of their Purveyors ſhould be firſt ſerved with a Pot of Fiſh in the Market, that Earl revenged himſelf by choaking the Mouth of the River, and by making Weirs with Timber, Sand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereby intirely ruining the Navigation thereof farther up than <hi>Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham.</hi> And ſo great was the Power and Obſtinacy of the Earl at that time, that tho' the Citizens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0141100401:326"/>
a Decree in Equity for their Relief, it was never executed.</p>
            <p>To remove this Inconvenience, the Inhabitants, about 40 Years ſince, by Aid of an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at a great Expence perfected a Work, which had been begun above 100 Years before; they cut a new Chanel for the Water, croſs which they placed Sluices or Flood-gates: thro' the lowermoſt of thoſe Gates, they let in the flowing Tide, the Ebb of which immediately ſhuts the Gate, and that keeps up a Body of Water for about Two Miles, ſufficient to carry up the Veſſels ſo far in their Way; at which Place another of thoſe Gates ſhuts, after the Veſſel is paſt it, by Capſterns there fixed for that Purpoſe. It muſt be conſidered, that the Floor of the Dyke is thus far on a Level, and conſequently the Water of an equal Depth, without the Inconvenience of any Current, the lower Sluice being ſhut as before.</p>
            <p>The whole Declivity from the Quay at <hi>Exeter,</hi> to the lowermoſt Flood-gate at <hi>Topſham,</hi> which gives the River its Current, is about Eight or Ten Feet, all which is ſunk at once here, above this ſecond Sluice; and therefore, in order to bring up Ships over this Fall, it was neceſſary, that a third Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſhould be added; which is accordingly done, at about 200 Feet from the former. And now, the Ship being between theſe two Flood-gates, (the lower being kept ſhut) the uppermoſt of the two is opened, and by this means the Water between them raiſed to a Level with that of the Remainder of the Dyke above; and the Ship, by this Contrivance, floats freely over the riſing Ground; and thence, on the freſh Water, (for the Tide is of no farther Uſe) for about Two Miles more, which brings her to the Head of the Works, where there is another Flood-gate; and this ponds the whole River, ſo as to throw the waſte Water, over a ſtrong Stone Weir, into its natural Chanel. The Water ſo kept back
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0141100401:327"/>
by this Upper-ſluice, and the Weir, makes a ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Pool above; and here the Veſſels lie at their Moorings, and unload at a Quay adjoining to the City Walls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Semper fidelis,</hi> is the Motto to the City Arms; and how juſt a Title they have thereto, will appear from their Behaviour, when they have been attacked by the Enemies of their lawful Sovereign, of which take the following ſhort Sketch:</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the Town was quitted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Citizens defended it againſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> for their then lawful Maſters, the <hi>Britons</hi>; and held it out for 300 Years, after the Eaſtern Parts of the Iſland had ſubmitted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they had been compelled to admit the <hi>Saxons</hi> into a ſort of Co-ordinate Power with them, they courageouſly withſtood the <hi>Danes,</hi> and tho' at laſt overcome by them, they took the firſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and joined with King <hi>Alfred,</hi> who with their Aſſiſtance routed the <hi>Danes.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. After this, as long as they were able, they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a Share of Government with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til King <hi>Athelſtane</hi> wholly ſubdued them, and (as before-mentioned) fortified the Town with a Wall and Gates. This generous Prince was ſo well pleaſed with their Bravery, that he granted them many Privileges and Immunities.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Year 875, the Citizens again defended themſelves ſtoutly againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> who came upon them by Sea, but landed, and formed a Camp on the North-ſide thereof, in a Place called <hi>Danes-caſtle</hi> to this Day, where their Trenches are yet to be ſeen.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Town held out for a Month, againſt <hi>Swain</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and was at laſt taken by Treachery.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0141100401:328"/>6. When <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> came againſt it, the Citizens defended themſelves until a Part of the City Wall fell down.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The loyal Townſmen took Part with <hi>Maud</hi> (their undoubted Sovereign) againſt King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and were at laſt reduced by Famine.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In 1469, the Earl of <hi>Devon</hi> came before it in behalf of the then rightful Claimant King <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. and the Citizens delivered it up, ſending away the Lords and others of the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Party to <hi>Calais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. They ſhew'd their Loyalty to King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. by defending the Town againſt <hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> the Pretender of that Time. In Teſtimony whereof, that King gave them the Sword and Cap; which <hi>Regalia</hi> are no ſmall Part of their Pomp, to this Day.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The rebellious Commons of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> met with a very ſtout Reſiſtance here, and tho' grievouſly pinched with Famine, the Town held it out until the 6th of <hi>Auguſt</hi>; when they were relieved by the Lord <hi>Ruſſel.</hi> In Memory of which that is ſtill a Gaudy-day, and a Sermon is preached yearly on the Occaſion, by the Mayor's Chaplain.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In the grand Rebellion it was twice beſieged, and held out for the Royal Cauſe until the King's Affairs grew every-where deſperate. And as ſoon as General <hi>Monk</hi> appeared in Oppoſition to the illegal Powers, the Citizens aſſembled themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for a free Parliament.</p>
            <p n="12">12. When the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> landed at <hi>Torbay,</hi> and ſent a Detachment to take Poſſeſſion of this City, the Inhabitants received them but coldly; and tho' they knew themſelves incapable of making any Reſiſtance, and were as ſenſible as other Parts of the Kingdom, of the Danger they were in from arbitrary Power; yet were they very tender of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0141100401:329"/>
joining in any Affair that might be conſtrued a Rebellion to their lawful Prince.</p>
            <p>To the Account of Religious Houſes, and Lands formerly appropriated thereto, let me add here, the Priory of <hi>Poleſloe,</hi> and that of <hi>Cowick,</hi> each of them but one Mile from <hi>Exeter</hi>; at a greater Diſtance, (but muſt be mentioned here, or not at all) <hi>Canons-leigh, Canons-Teing, Indio</hi>; and larger than either of theſe, the Abbey of <hi>Buckfaſtleigh,</hi> Part of whoſe Ruins are yet to be ſeen, and not one Inſtance is there amongſt them all, that contradicts my former Obſervations in relation to the Goodneſs of the Soil.</p>
            <p>Near the Mouth of the River <hi>Exe,</hi> on the Weſt Banks thereof, is <hi>Powderham-caſtle,</hi> now, and for many Ages paſt, the Seat of a Family of <hi>Courtenays,</hi> Deſcendants from the Earl of <hi>Devon</hi> of that Name. This Seat, built in the manner of a Caſtle, is a very grand Piece of Antiquity; and was the Work of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Baldwin de Rivers,</hi> and Widow of <hi>William de Fortibus,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> III.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Halldown</hi> is a pretty large, dry, heathy Common of about Seven Miles in Length, and about Three in Breadth, which, tho' ſeparated by ſome incloſed Grounds of a pretty good Nature, ſeems to be the ſame Vein of Land, of which the Foreſt of <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> and the downy Part of <hi>Aſhburton, Ilſington, Bridford, &amp;c.</hi> conſiſt.</p>
            <p>On the North, and quite home to the Brink of this Down, is that rich Track of Land which I have already deſcribed, as Part of the moſt fertile Soil in this County.</p>
            <p>Tho' this Down is in itſelf a very flinty barren Soil; yet is its Situation ſo delightful, the open Proſpect, both by Sea and Land, ſo engaging, and the whole Circuit thereof ſo adapted to rural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, that the like Number of Gentlemens Seats as lie round the Skirts thereof within ſo little

Compaſs of Ground, are not to be met with at any Place that I know of, ſave only about <hi>London</hi>; which is not only a Confirmation of what I have obſerved, but a very great Addition to the Delight ariſing from the large Extent of the View.</p>
            <p>And here it cannot be foreign to my Subject to inſert the Names of thoſe genteel Habitations, and that of their ſeveral worthy Owners and Poſſeſſors.</p>

               <hi>Exeter</hi> is particularly famous for two Things, which we ſeldom find united in the ſame Town; <hi>viz.</hi> That it is full of Gentry, and yet full of Trade and Manufactures.</p>
            <p>The Serge-market held here every Week, is very well worth a Stranger's ſeeing, and, next to the <hi>Brigg Market</hi> at <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> is the greateſt in <hi>England.</hi> The People aſſured me, that at this Market is generally ſold from 60 to 70 to 80, and ſometimes a Hundred thouſand Pounds Value in Serges in a Week.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Exe,</hi> or <hi>Eſk,</hi> is a very conſiderable River, and the principal in the whole County, and by the Contrivance we have mentioned, Ships of 150 Tons now come up to the City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exeter</hi> drives a very great Correſpondence with <hi>Holland,</hi> as alſo directly to <hi>Portugal, Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>; ſhipping off vaſt Quantities of their Woollen Manufactures, eſpecially to <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> giving very large Commiſſions here for the buying of Serges, Perpetuanas, and ſuch Goods; which are made not only in and about <hi>Exeter,</hi> but at <hi>Crediton, Honiton, Culliton, St. Mary Ottery, Newton-buſhell, Aſhburton,</hi> and eſpecially at <hi>Tiverton, Cullumpton, Bampton,</hi> and all the North-eaſt Part of the County; which Part is, as it may be ſaid, fully imploy'd, the People made rich, and the Poor well maintained by it. Some are of Opinion, however, that <hi>Exeter</hi> has of late Years viſibly diminiſhed in its Trade, ſome Part of which has, it is ſaid, removed itſelf to other Quarters.</p>
            <p>On the North-ſide of the Caſtle, (and which was formerly its Counterſcarp) is a very beautiful Terrace-walk, bounded by a double Row of fine Elms, and extended round one Quarter of the City; <hi>viz.</hi> from the Eaſt-gate to the North-gate. This, for the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0141100401:332"/>
Fineneſs of the Air, Length of the Walk, and the Landſchape in View, is not perhaps inferior to any thing of the kind in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This County, and this Part of it in particular, has been famous for the Birth of ſeveral Perſons, eminent as well for Learning and Arts, as for War: Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, 1. Sir <hi>William Petre,</hi> who was Secretary of State, and Privy-Counſellor to King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. <hi>Edward</hi> VI. Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; and Seven times ſent Embaſſador into foreign Countries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley,</hi> famous, and of grateful Memory to all learned Men, and Lovers of Letters, for his collecting and eſtabliſhing the beſt Library in <hi>Britain,</hi> which is now at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and is called after his Name the <hi>Bodleian Library.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> born at <hi>Plymouth.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. The learned Mr. <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> Author of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Polity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Dr. <hi>Arthur Duck,</hi> a Civilian, well known by his Works among the learned Advocates of <hi>Doctors Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Dr. <hi>John Moreman</hi> of <hi>Southold,</hi> famous for being the firſt Clergyman in <hi>England,</hi> who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to teach his Pariſhioners the <hi>Lord's Prayer, Creed,</hi> and <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; and reading them publickly in the Pariſh Church of <hi>Mayenhennet,</hi> in this County, of which he was Vicar.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Dr. <hi>John de Brampton,</hi> a Man of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who flouriſhed in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. was famous for being the firſt that read <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> publickly in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and for writing ſeveral learned Books, which are now loſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Peter Blundel,</hi> a Clothier, who built the Free-School at <hi>Tiverton,</hi> and endowed it very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely.</p>

               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0141100401:333"/>10. Sir <hi>John Glanvill,</hi> a noted Lawyer, and one of the Judges of the Common-Pleas.</p>

            <p n="12">12. Sir <hi>John Maynard,</hi> an eminent Lawyer of later Years; one of the Commiſſioners of the Great Seal under King <hi>William</hi> III. All theſe Three were born at <hi>Taviſtock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Sir <hi>Peter King,</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common-Pleas, ſeveral Years Lord High-Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and created a Peer of this Realm.</p>

            <p n="15">15. The great Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> Captain-General of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces in Q. <hi>Anne</hi>'s Wars.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take the North Part of this County in my Return from <hi>Cornwall</hi>; ſo I muſt now lean to the South-coaſt, for in going on indeed we go South-weſt.</p>
            <p>About 22 Miles from <hi>Exeter,</hi> and thro' <hi>Newtonbuſhel,</hi> a large, but meanly built Market-town, we go into the antient Town of <hi>Totneſs,</hi> on the River <hi>Dart.</hi> It was formerly of great Note, and ſtill is a pretty good Town, and has ſome Trade, but has more Gentlemen in it than Tradeſmen of Note: they have a very fine Stone Bridge here over the River, which being within 7 or 8 Miles of the Sea, is very large, and the Tide flows 10 or 12 Feet at the Bridge. Here we had the Diverſion of ſeeing them catch Fiſh, with the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Dog; in this manner: On the South Side of the River, and on a Slip, or narrow Cut or Chanel made on purpoſe, ſtands a Corn-mill; the Mill-tail, or Floor for the Water below the Wheels, is wharfed up on either Side with Stone, above High-water Mark, and for above 20 or 30 Feet in Length below it, on that Part of the River toward the Sea.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0141100401:334"/>
At the End of this Wharfing is a Grating of Wood, the Croſs Bars of which ſtand bearing inward, ſharp at the End, and pointing towards one another, as the Wires of a Mouſe-trap.</p>
            <p>When the Tide flows up, the Fiſh can with Eaſe go in between the Points of theſe Croſs-bars, but the Mill being ſhut down, they can go no farther upwards; and when the Water ebbs again, are left behind, not being able to paſs the Points of the Grating, which like a Mouſe-trap keeps them in; ſo that they are left at the Bottom with about a Foot, or a Foot and half Water. We were carry'd hither at Low-water, where we ſaw about 50 or 60 ſmall Salmon, from 17 to 20 Inches long, which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-people call <hi>Salmon Peal</hi>; and to catch theſe, they throw in a Net on a Hoop at the End of a Pole, the Pole going croſs the Hoop, which, in ſome Places, they call a Shove Net. The Net being fix'd at one End of the Place, they put in a Dog, who is taught his Trade before-hand, at the other End, and he drives all the Fiſh into the Net; ſo that only holding the Net ſtill in its Place, the Man took up Two or Three-and-thirty Salmon Peal at the firſt time.</p>
            <p>Of theſe we had Six for our Dinner, for which they aſk'd a Shilling only; and for ſuch ſiz'd Fiſh, and not ſo freſh, I have ſeen 6<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> each given at a <hi>London</hi> Fiſh-market, whither they are ſometimes brought from <hi>Chicheſter</hi> by Land-Carriage. They have alſo delicate Trouts here.</p>
            <p>This exceſſive Plenty of ſo good Fiſh, (other Proviſions being cheap in Proportion) makes the Town of <hi>Totneſs</hi> a very good Place to live in; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for ſuch as have large Families, and but ſmall Eſtates; and many ſuch are ſaid to come into thoſe Parts on purpoſe for ſaving Money.</p>
            <p>This Town made itſelf remarkable for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the Inhabitants to King <hi>George</hi> I. on the Union of the Emperor and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0141100401:335"/>
Treaty of <hi>Vienna</hi>: they profeſs'd their Zeal and Loyalty to his Perſon; and when the good Town of <hi>Totneſs</hi> had but a very inſignificant Share of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, aſſur'd the King of their Readineſs to grant not only 4<hi>s.</hi> a Pound Land-tax, but to give into the Bargain the other 16<hi>s.</hi> if his Majeſty's Service requir'd it; together with ſeveral other extravagant Declarations of Zeal and Oſtentation, which made them the Subject of Ridicule all over the Kingdom, for being ſo laviſh in their Profeſſions, when, as a Corporation, they had little or nothing to give.</p>
            <p>About Ten Miles North of <hi>Totneſs,</hi> lies <hi>Aſhbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a good Market-town, and Thoroughfare from <hi>Exeter</hi> to <hi>Plymouth.</hi> This is one of the Four Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Towns for the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> and lies but a little Way in from the Foreſt of <hi>Dartmore.</hi> The principal Trade of this Town, and indeed all the Towns and Villages in the whole County, is in the Woollen Manufacture.</p>
            <p>The Three other Stannary Towns are <hi>Taviſtock, Plympton,</hi> and <hi>Chagford,</hi> the laſt of which is a very poor inconſiderable Place, and neither that nor <hi>Plympton</hi> are capable of entertaining the Suitors, if the Lord Warden ſhould be ever inclined to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ the Court thither.</p>
            <p>And now having mentioned this Court of Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, it may not be improper to give a further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription thereof.</p>
            <p>By divers Charters granted to the Tinners by King <hi>Edward</hi> I. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Court is to be held at <hi>Crockeren Torr,</hi> a noted Hill and Rock in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Foreſt, far diſtant from any Houſe: the Lord Warden of the Stannaries is the Judge of this Court, on whoſe Summons the Jurors appear, who are generally Gentlemen within the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. I had my Information from a Gentleman, who, if I miſtake not, told me he had ſerved as a Juror; and that when the Earl of <hi>Bath</hi> was Lord
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0141100401:336"/>
Warden, and held a Court there, he was attended by 300 Gentlemen well mounted.</p>
            <p>At this deſolate Place (where no Refreſhment is to be had, but what the Company bring with them, no Shelter from the Weather, nor any thing to ſit upon, but a Moor-ſtone Bench) the Court is called: but then the next Act of the Steward is to adjourn to one of the Stannary Towns, (uſually <hi>Taviſtock)</hi> and the Company immediately makes the beſt of their Way thither.</p>
            <p>At this Court, in former Times, when the Tin Mines in this County were in a flouriſhing State, a great deal of Buſineſs was diſpatched; the Price of the Tin was fix'd, Differences in relation to the Works adjuſted, and Acts made for Regulation of every thing relating thereto. Several Preſentments of the Jurors are printed, and this Meeting is vulgarly called, <hi>The Parliament for the Stannaries</hi>; the Place of Meeting in the Foreſt, <hi>The Parliament Houſe</hi>; and the Preſentment of the Jurors, <hi>Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Abbey of <hi>Taviſtock,</hi> the Priory at <hi>Plympton,</hi> and the Monaſtery at <hi>Buckland Monachorum,</hi> were very large Endowments; and their Scite well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes the Obſervation I have ſeveral times before made, in relation to the Fertility of the Soil where thoſe Orders of Men generally ſeated themſelves. An Obſervation, I have made rather to confirm that of other Writers, than as Matter of Wonder or Reflection; for would it not be ſtrange, if the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks ſhould not be as capable of chuſing for themſelves as other People? or that they ſhould chuſe the worſt, if they might have the beſt?</p>
            <p>At <hi>Taviſtock</hi> I ſaw ſome ſtately Remains of that grand Building; and among other things, part of the Butments of the Arch of a Bridge over the <hi>Tavy,</hi> which the Inhabitants call <hi>Guile-bridge,</hi> and relate the following Story; <hi>viz.</hi> That one <hi>Childe,</hi> Owner
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0141100401:337"/>
of the Manor of <hi>Plymſtock,</hi> made his Will, and gave the ſaid Lands to the Church where his Body ſhould be buried; and that afterwards, hunting in the Foreſt, he loſt his Company and his Way, and tho', as his laſt Shift, he kill'd his Horſe, and got into the warm Belly of him, he at length died there with the Extremity of Cold. The Body, after ſome Search, was found by the <hi>Taviſtoch</hi> Men, (who had, by ſome means, come to the Knowledge of his Will) and by them carried away towards their Abbey. The <hi>Plymſtock</hi> Men, hearing thereof, lay in Ambuſh for them at a Bridge, where they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended they muſt paſs: but in this they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for the Prieſts built a ſlight Bridge on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, over which they carried the Corps; by which Statagem they obtain'd the ſaid Land; and hence, ſays the Tradition, this is called <hi>Guile-bridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Totneſs</hi> we went ſtill South about Seven Miles (all in View of the River) to <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> a Town of Note, ſeated at the Mouth of the River <hi>Dart,</hi> where it empties itſelf into the Sea, at a very narrow, but ſafe Entrance. The Opening into <hi>Dartmouth Harbour</hi> is not broad, but the Chanel deep enough for the biggeſt Ship in the Royal Navy: The Sides of the Entrance are high mounded with Rocks; without which, juſt at the firſt Narrowing of the Paſſage, ſtands a good ſtrong Fort beyond a Platform of Guns, which commands the Port.</p>
            <p>The narrow Entrance is not much above half a Mile, and then it opens and makes a Baſin, or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, able to receive 500 Sail of Ships, where they may ride with the greateſt Safety, and the Entrance may be chain'd up on Occaſion. I went out in a Boat to view this Entrance, and the Caſtle or Fort that commands it; and coming back with the Tide of Flood, I obſerv'd ſome ſmall Fiſh to ſkip and play upon the Surface of the Water; upon which I aſk'd, What Fiſh they were? Immediately one of the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0141100401:338"/>
Rowers or Seamen ſtarted up in the Boat, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Arms abroad, as if he had been mad, cries out as loud as he could bawl, <hi>A Scool! a Scool!</hi> The Word was taken on the Shore as haſtily as it would have been on Land, if he had cry'd Fire; and by that Time we reach'd the Quays, the Town was all in a kind of an Uproar.</p>
            <p>The Matter was, that a great <hi>Shoal,</hi> or, as they call it, a <hi>Scool</hi> of Pilchards, came ſwimming with the Tide, directly out of the Sea into the Harbour. The Boat-owner lamented his being unprepared for them; for he ſaid, that if he could but have had a Day or two's Warning, he might have taken 200 Tun of them; in ſhort, nobody was ready for them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a ſmall Fiſhing-boat or Two; one of which went into the Middle of the Harbour, and at Two or Three Hawls took about 40,000.</p>
            <p>It was obſerv'd, that beyond the Mouth of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was a whole Army of Porpoiſes, which, it ſeems, purſu'd theſe Pilchards, and, 'tis probable, drove them into the Harbour. The <hi>Scool</hi> drove up the River a great Way, even as high as <hi>Totneſs</hi> Bridge, as we heard afterwards; ſo that the Country-people, who had Boats and Nets, caught as many as they knew what to do with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dartmouth</hi> is ſituated on the Weſt-ſide of this Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, or Harbour, in a kind of a Semicircle, on the Aſcent of a ſteep Hill, which, tho' large and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, is but meanly built; yet the Quay is large, and the Street before it ſpacious. Here live ſome very flouriſhing Merchants, who trade very proſperouſly, and to the moſt conſiderable trading Ports of <hi>Spain, Portugal, Italy,</hi> and the Plantations; but eſpecially to <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> with Fiſh; and they drive a good Trade alſo in their own Fiſhery of Pilchards, which is hereabouts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with the greateſt Number of Veſſels of any Port in the Weſt, except <hi>Falmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0141100401:339"/>
               <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> like other Towns in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> is full of Diſſenters, who have here a very large Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe. The <hi>French</hi> burnt it in <hi>Richard</hi> I.'s Time, and attempted it afterwards, but were bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, and chiefly by the Women, who fought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately, and took Monſieur <hi>Caſtel,</hi> their General, Three Lords, and Twenty-three Knights Priſoners, and made a great Slaughter among them beſides; but how this glorious Action fell to the Share of the Women, and whether the Men were inactive, or abſent, is not mentioned.</p>
            <p>A little to the Southward of this Town, and to the Eaſt of the Port, is <hi>Torbay,</hi> a very good Road for Ships, about Twelve Miles in Circuit, tho' ſometimes, eſpecially with a Southerly or South-eaſt Wind, Ships have been obliged to quit the Bay, and put out to Sea, or run into <hi>Dartmouth</hi> for Shelter.</p>
            <p>In the Bottom of this Bay is a beautiful, well-built, and finely-ſituated Houſe, call'd <hi>Torr-Abbey,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a Religious Houſe; but now the Inheritance of <hi>— Cary,</hi> Eſq. <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> is ſaid to have landed here, when he came to attack <hi>Arviragus,</hi> King of <hi>Britain.</hi> And here it was that King <hi>William</hi> III. enter'd with a Fleet of 6000 Tranſports, and 50 Sail of Men of War, under the Conduct of Admiral <hi>Herbert,</hi> ſince Lord <hi>Torrington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About Three Miles to the Weſt of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> is a little Fiſhing-town, call'd <hi>Brixham,</hi> remarkable for a Spring of Water, that ebbs and flows very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; a Deſcription of which may not be unacceptable, eſpecially as the Account I give of it is the Reſult of my own Obſervations; for I had ſo much Patience as to ſit by it for Fourteen Hours together, and carefully obſerve its Periods, and the Quantity of its ebbing and flowing.</p>
            <p>The Situation of this Spring is pretty near the Foot of a large Ridge of Hills, and the Quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that flows from it is conſiderable. It falls into
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0141100401:340"/>
a large Baſin, where it is very eaſy to obſerve (by lying in an inclining Plain) the perpendicular Height of its Ebbing and Flowing, as well as the Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween high and low Water.</p>
            <p>By a careful Obſervation of a great Number of Fluxes and Refluxes, I find, that when it proceeds regularly, (as it does ſometimes for Eight Hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) it is Eleven times in an Hour: for thus the 10th of <hi>July</hi> 1733, I obſerv'd it high Water at 8<hi rend="sup">h</hi>. 31′ in the Morning, and continued to obſerve it until 3<hi rend="sup">h</hi>. 3′ in the Afternoon; in which Interval of Seven Hours it had ebb'd and flow'd exactly Seventy-ſeven times.</p>
            <p>There happens ſometimes an Intermiſſion of thoſe Ebbings and Flowings; for in the Morning of the ſame Day, I obſerv'd that from 6<hi rend="sup">h</hi>. 37′, to 6<hi rend="sup">h</hi>. 58′, it had no Motion at all; and at another time I found it to intermit for an Hour, or more.</p>
            <p>The Baſin which receives the Water, contains, as I gueſs, about Twenty Feet in Area; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular Height of the Flowing, when I obſerv'd it, (which was in the Middle of Summer, and at a dry Seaſon) was various, <hi>viz.</hi> ſometimes an Inch and three Quarters, and at other times not above half an Inch; but generally about one Inch and one Eighth.</p>
            <p>The Reader will be rather pleaſed with this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, as it may, in ſome meaſure, confirm that ingenious, and very probable Hypotheſis, which was read by Dr. <hi>Atwell</hi> before the Royal Society, and is publiſh'd in their Tranſactions, touching reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procating Springs; and of this (which is called <hi>Lay-well</hi>) in particular.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Dartmouth</hi> we went to <hi>Plympton</hi> before-mentioned, as a poor Town, though it was formerly of great Account, and the Glory of the antient Earls of <hi>Devon,</hi> where are Tenures at this Day, called <hi>Caſtle-guard,</hi> for defending and repairing the Walls of the Caſtle, which however is now in Ruins. From
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0141100401:341"/>
thence the Road lies to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> Diſtance about Six Miles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plymouth</hi> is indeed a Town of Conſideration and Importance. The Situation of it is between Two very large Inlets of the Sea, and in the Bottom of a large Sound or Bay, which is incompaſs'd on every Side with Hills, and the Shore generally ſteep and rocky, tho' the Anchorage is good, and it is pretty ſafe Ride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the Entrance to this Bay, lies a large and moſt dangerous Rock, which at High-water is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, but at Low-tide lies bare, where many a good Ship has been loſt, when they have thought all their Dangers at an End.</p>
            <p>Upon this Rock, which was called the <hi>Eddyſtone,</hi> from its Situation, the ingenious Mr. <hi>Winſtanley,</hi> whom I have mention'd before, <hi>p.</hi> 107. undertook to build a Light-houſe for the Direction of Sailors, and with great Art and Expedition finiſh'd it: which Work, conſidering its Height, the Magnitude of its Building, and the little Hold there was to faſten it to the Rock, ſtood to Admiration, and bore out many a bitter Storm.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Winſtanley</hi> often viſited, and frequently ſtrengthen'd the Building by new Works; and was ſo confident of its Firmneſs and Stability, that he uſually ſaid, to thoſe who doubted its Standing in hard Weather, that he only deſir'd to be in it, when a Storm ſhould happen.</p>
            <p>But in the dreadful Tempeſt of <hi>Nov.</hi> 27. 1703, when he happen'd to be ſo unhappy as to have his Wiſh, he would fain have been on Shore, making Signals for Help; but no Boats durſt go off to him; and in the Morning after the Storm, nothing was to be ſeen but the bare Rock, the Light-houſe being gone, in which Mr. <hi>Winſtanley,</hi> and all that were with him, periſh'd; and a few Days after, a Merchant's Ship, call'd the <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> Homeward-bound from <hi>Virginia,</hi> not knowing the Light-houſe was down,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0141100401:342"/>
ran foul of the Rock, and was loſt with all her Lade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and moſt of her Men: but there is now another Light-houſe built on the ſame Rock by the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Trinity-houſe,</hi> in Purſuance of an Act of Parliament paſſed in the Fifth of Queen <hi>Anne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Plymouth</hi> lies in the Bottom of this <hi>Sound,</hi> in the Centre between the Two Waters, ſo there lies againſt it, in the ſame Poſition, an Iſland which they call <hi>St. Nicolas,</hi> on which is a Caſtle that commands the Entrance into <hi>Ham-Ouze,</hi> and indeed that alſo into <hi>Catwater</hi> in ſome Sort. On the Shore, over-againſt this Iſland, is the Citadel of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> a ſmall, but regular Fortification, inacceſſible by Sea, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtrong by Land; except that they ſay the Works are of a Stone hard as Marble, and would not ſoon yield to the Batteries of an Enemy: but that is a Language our modern Engineers laugh at. It is ſurrounded with a deep Trench, out of which was dug the Stone that built the whole Citadel, which is about three Quarters of a Mile in Circumference, and has 300 great Guns on its Walls, which ſtand thickeſt towards the Sea. Several Guns are alſo planted on part of the old Fort, lying almoſt level with the Water, all which gives the greateſt Security to the Ships in the Harbour.</p>
            <p>The Town ſtands above the Citadel, upon the ſame Rock, and lies ſloping on the Side of it, towards the Eaſt, the Inlet of the Sea (which is call'd <hi>Catwater,</hi> and is a Harbour capable of receiving any Number of Ships, and of any Size) waſhing the Eaſtern Shore of the Town, where they have a kind of natural Mole, or Haven, with a Quay, and all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies for bringing in Veſſels for loading and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading; nor is the Trade carried on here inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in itſelf.</p>
            <p>The other Inlet of the Sea, as I term it, is on the other Side of the Town, and is cal'd <hi>Ham-Ouze,</hi> being the Mouth of the River <hi>Tamar,</hi> a conſiderable
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0141100401:343"/>
River, which parts the Two Counties of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall.</hi> Here the War with <hi>France</hi> making it neceſſary, that the Ships of War ſhould have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat nearer Hand than at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> the late King <hi>William</hi> order'd a wet Dock, with Yards, dry Docks, Launches, and Conveniencies of all kinds for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repairing of Ships, to be built. Theſe wet and dry Docks are about Two Miles up the <hi>Ham-Ouze,</hi> and for the Neatneſs and Excellency of the Work, exceed all that were ever built of the Kind, being hewn out of a Mine of Slate, and lin'd with <hi>Portland</hi> Stone. The dry Dock is built after the Mould of a Firſt-rate Man of War, and the wet Dock will contain Five of the ſame Bigneſs. What follow'd theſe, as it were of Courſe, was the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Store-houſes and Ware-houſes for the Rigging, Sails, naval and military Stores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of ſuch Ships as may be appointed to be laid up there, with very handſome Houſes for the Commiſſioners, Clerks, and Officers of all kinds uſual in the King's Yards, to dwell in. It is, in ſhort, now become as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete an Arſenal, or Yard, for building and fitting out Men of War, as any the Government are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of; and perhaps much more convenient than ſome of them, tho' not ſo large; and this has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd a proportional Increaſe of Buildings to the Town.</p>
            <p>Here are Two fine Churches, and Two or Three Meeting-houſes for Diſſenters, and <hi>French</hi> Refugees; as alſo a Free-ſchool, and an Hoſpital for Blue-coat Boys.</p>
            <p>Oppoſite to this Place, on the other Side <hi>Ham-Ouze,</hi> is ſituated <hi>Mount Edgcumbe,</hi> the Seat of <hi>Richard Edgcumbe,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> deem'd one of the nobleſt Proſpects in <hi>England</hi>; overlooking at once the Sea, the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Citadel, and Town of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and the County adjacent for a great Way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0141100401:344"/>From <hi>Plymouth</hi> we paſs the <hi>Tamar,</hi> over a Ferry to <hi>Saltaſh,</hi> a little poor ſhatter'd Town, the firſt we ſet Foot on in the County of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> The <hi>Tamar</hi> here is very wide, and the Ferry-boats bad, ſo that I thought myſelf well off, when I got ſafe on Shore in <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> publiſh'd, in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> I. a very judicious Survey of this County, dedicated to Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh.</hi> The Reader may there inform himſelf, in a very particular manner, of its Natural Hiſtory, and the Produce, Cuſtoms, and Rarities, which it abounds with. Among other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, he may there find complete Liſts of the Knights Fees, Barons, Knights, and Men at Arms, together with the Survey of the Acres taken by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon de Roff,</hi> and his Fellows, Juſtices itinerant, at <hi>Launceſton,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> I. by which Survey it appears, that this County contain'd, at that Time, 5555 Acres; and the Author tells us, that a <hi>Corniſh</hi> Acre, or one fourth Part of a Knight's Fee, contained Nine Farthings Land, each of which was, as he thinks, about Thirty of our Statute Acres. If all this be true, then that County con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, at that time, One million and Five hundred thouſand Acres, which is more, by one Third, than it is now eſtimated to be, and doth, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſtrengthen the Conjecture, that a great Part of the Land on this Coaſt is devoured by the Sea, and that the <hi>Scilly</hi> Rocks were formerly a Part of the Land, tho' now Ten Leagues diſtant.</p>
            <p>Among the natural Productions of this County, ought not to be omitted their Slate, the beſt in <hi>Europe</hi> for covering of Houſes; the <hi>Moor-ſtone,</hi> which, by a very laborious Poliſhing, (a Matter very lately attempted) equals in Beauty the <hi>Egyptian Granate.</hi> I take no Notice of the Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Lead; the Marble, Agat, Coral,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0141100401:345"/>
and even Diamonds, which are here found, becauſe theſe have been obſerv'd by all who mention the Productions of this Weſtern County; and for the ſame Reaſon ſhall omit the manner of their working their Mines, and refining the Ore.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants have been remarkable for their Strength of Body; witneſs, among numberleſs others, <hi>John Bray,</hi> who carried on his Back Six Buſhels of Meal, of Fifteen Gallons to the Buſhel, and the Miller, a Man of Twenty-four Years of Age, on the Top of it; alſo <hi>John Roman,</hi> who carried, at one time, the whole Carcaſe of an Ox.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saltaſh</hi> ſeems to be the Ruins of a larger Place, it is govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen, has many Privileges, ſends Members to Parliament, has the ſole Oyſter-Fiſhing in the whole River, which is conſiderable. It has alſo Juriſdiction upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Tamar,</hi> down to the Mouth of the Port, ſo that they claim Anchorage of all ſmall Ships, that enter the River: their Coroner ſits upon all Bodies that are found drown'd in the River, and the like. Here is a good Market, and it is very much benefited by the Increaſe of the Inhabitants of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> as lying near the Dock at the Mouth of <hi>Ham-Oze</hi>; for thoſe People chooſe rather to go to <hi>Saltaſh</hi> to Market by Water, than to walk to <hi>Plymouth</hi> by Land for their Proviſions: becauſe, firſt, as they go in the Town-boat, the ſame Boat brings home what they buy, ſo that it is much leſs Trouble; ſecondly, becauſe Proviſions are bought much cheaper at <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſh</hi> than at <hi>Plymouth:</hi> and of late, they have ſome Ships that uſe the <hi>Newfoundland</hi> Fiſhery.</p>
            <p>There is no other Town up the <hi>Tamar,</hi> till we come to <hi>Launceſton,</hi> the County Town, which I ſhall take in my Return, except <hi>Kellington,</hi> a pretty good Market and Portreve Town, where is a good Market-houſe, and a neat Church, which, as well as the other Buildings in the Town, are in good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0141100401:346"/>
ſo I turn'd Weſt, keeping the South Shore of the County, to the <hi>Land's-end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Saltaſh</hi> I went to <hi>Leſkard,</hi> about Seven Miles. This is a conſiderable Town, well-built, has People of Faſhion in it, and a very great Market: it is one of the Five Stannary Towns, and was once ſtill more eminent, and had a good Caſtle, and a large Houſe, where the antient Dukes of <hi>Cornwall</hi> kept their Court: it alſo enjoy'd ſeveral conſiderable Privileges, eſpecially by the Favour of the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> who, as Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> reſided here: and in Return, they ſay, this Town, and the Country round it, raiſed a great Body of ſtout young Fellows, who entered into his Service, and followed his Fortunes in his Wars. But theſe Buildings are ſo decay'd, that there are now ſcarce any of the Ruins of the Caſtle, or of the Prince's Court, remaining. Here was alſo antiently a Chapel, much reſorted to by Pilgrims in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Times; and in the Town is a Fountain of very clear Water, to which many miraculous Cures were attributed.</p>
            <p>It ſtill boaſts of its <hi>Guild,</hi> or <hi>Town-hall,</hi> on which is a Turret with a fine Clock; a good Free-School, well provided; a very fine Conduit in the Market-place; an antient large Church, dedicated to St. <hi>Martin</hi>; and a large new-built <hi>Meeting-houſe</hi> for the Diſſenters; which I name, becauſe they aſſured me there were but Three more, and thoſe inconſiderable, in all the County of <hi>Cornwall</hi>; whereas in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> which is the next County, there are reckoned about 70, ſome of which are exceeding large and fine.</p>
            <p>This Town is alſo remarkable for the Defeat of the Parliament Army by Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> and for a very great Trade in all Manfactures of Leather, ſuch as Boots, Shoes, Gloves, Purſes, Breeches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome Spinning of late Years is ſet up here,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0141100401:347"/>
encourag'd by the Woollen Manufacturers of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Between theſe Two Towns of <hi>Saltaſh</hi> and <hi>Leskard,</hi> is the Borough of <hi>St. Germans,</hi> now a Village, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd, and without any Market, but the largeſt Pariſh in the whole County; in the Bounds of which are contained 17 Villages, and the Town of <hi>Saltaſh</hi> among them; for <hi>Saltaſh</hi> Church, it ſeems, was but a Chapel of Eaſe to <hi>St. Germans.</hi> It has been antiently a Biſhop's See, which was tranſlated from <hi>Bodmyn</hi> hither, and afterwards from <hi>St. Germans</hi> to <hi>Crediton,</hi> then one of the beſt Towns in the County, and thence to <hi>Exeter.</hi> This Town takes its Name from St. <hi>German,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who came over from <hi>France,</hi> to preach againſt the Hereſy of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> which then began to ſpread in <hi>England,</hi> and took up his Reſidence here. The Ruins of the Epiſcopal Palace at <hi>Cuttenbeck,</hi> a Mile and half from the Town, which afterwards dwindled into a Farm-houſe, are ſtill viſible. A Gentleman of the Name of <hi>Elliott</hi> was lately a great Benefactor to this Town, having endowed a publick School there, repaired the Seſſions-houſe, and beautify'd the Church; where he was buried, and has a fine <hi>Italian</hi> party-coloured Marble Monument erected to his Memory by his Widow. There is ſtill an Epiſcopal Chair in the Church, and ſeveral other Seats belonging to Canons. The Town ſtands on a riſing Ground, and is built in the Form of an Amphitheatre.</p>
            <p>In the Neighbourhood of theſe Towns are many pleaſant Seats of <hi>Corniſh</hi> Gentry, who are indeed very numerous, and the moſt ſociable, generous, and kind Neighbours to one another that are to be found; and uſually intermarry among themſelves; from whence, they ſay, the Proverb, <hi>That all the</hi> Corniſh <hi>Gentlemen are Couſins.</hi> It is the very ſame in <hi>Wales,</hi> where the greateſt Compliment that one Gentleman can make to another of the ſame County, is to call
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0141100401:348"/>
him Couſin. There is a great Conformity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Cuſtoms, and Uſages between the <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Corniſh,</hi> who are accounted of the ſame Origin, and Deſcendants alſo of the antient <hi>Britons</hi>; and there is likewiſe a great Affinity between the old <hi>Corniſh</hi> and <hi>Welſh</hi> Language.</p>
            <p>On the Hills North of <hi>Leskard,</hi> and in the Way between that Town and <hi>Launceſton,</hi> are many Tin Mines, and ſome of the richeſt Veins of that Metal in the whole County; which when caſt at the Blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes into Blocks, are ſent to <hi>Leskard</hi> to be coined.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Leskard,</hi> in our Courſe Weſt, we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily carried to the Sea-coaſt, becauſe of the River <hi>Fowey,</hi> which empties itſelf into the Sea, at a very large Mouth; and hereby, this River riſing in the Middle of the Breadth of the County, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning South, and the River <hi>Camel</hi> riſing not far from it, and running North, with a like large Chanel, the Land from <hi>Bodmyn</hi> to the Weſtern Part of the County, is almoſt made an Iſland, and in a manner cut off from the Eaſtern; the Iſthmus, or Neck of Land between, being not above Twelve Miles over.</p>
            <p>In the Pariſh of <hi>St. Cleer</hi> is a Piece of Antiquity, which they call, <hi>The other Half-ſtone,</hi> which are indeed Two Stones fixed in the Ground; and by Mortaiſes in each, they ſeem to have been heretofore joined together. Both of them were curiouſly wrought by Diaper-work-carvings; but one of them hath an Inſcription in very antique Characters, as follows:

                  <figDesc>inscription on stone</figDesc>
               </figure>
Which ſeem to expreſs thus much; <hi>Doniert. Rogavit pro Anima</hi>; implying that <hi>Dungarth</hi> or <hi>Doniert</hi> (King of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> who was drown'd <hi>A. D.</hi> 872.) gave this Land for the Good of his Soul.</p>
            <p>Not far diſtant is a Heap of large Stones, under which lies a great Stone, faſhioned like a Cheeſe, and ſeems to the Eye, as if it were preſs'd into that Form by the Weight that lies upon it; and hence they call it <hi>Wring-cheeſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the South from <hi>Leskard</hi> we come to <hi>Foy,</hi> or <hi>Fowey,</hi> an antient Borough-town, and formerly very large and potent; for the <hi>Foyens,</hi> as they were then call'd, were able to fit out large Fleets, not only for Merchants Ships, but even of Men of War; and with theſe, not only fought with, but ſeveral times vanquiſhed and routed, the Squadron of the Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Men, who in thoſe Days were very powerful.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> obſerves, that the Town of <hi>Foy</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſome Part of the Arms of every one of thoſe Cinque-ports with their own; intimating, that they had at ſeveral times triumph'd over them all: and indeed they were once ſo powerful, that they fitted out their Fleets againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and took ſeveral of their Men of War, when they were at Variance with <hi>England,</hi> and enriching their Town by the Spoil of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0141100401:350"/>
               <hi>Edward</hi> IV. favour'd them much; and becauſe the <hi>French</hi> threaten'd to come up their River with a powerful Navy to burn their Town, he cauſed Two Forts to be built at the publick Charge, for its Security, the Ruins of which are ſtill to be ſeen: but the ſame King <hi>Edward</hi> was ſome time after ſo diſguſted at the Townſmen, for officiouſly falling upon the <hi>French,</hi> after a Truce was proclaimed, that he effectually diſarmed them, took away their whole Fleet, Ships, Tackle, Apparel and Furniture; and ſince that time we do not read of any of their Naval Exploits, nor that they ever attempted to recover their Strength at Sea. However, <hi>Foy,</hi> at this time. is a very fair Town; it lies extended on the Eaſt Sid, of the River, for above a Mile, the Buildings fair, and there are a great many flouriſhing Merchants in it, who have a great Share in the Fiſhing-trade, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for Pilchards. In this Town, is alſo a Coinage for the TIN, of which a great Quantity is dug up in the Country North and Weſt of the Town. The Church at <hi>Fowey</hi> is antient, and very fine.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Fowey,</hi> which is very broad and deep here, was formerly very navigable by Ships of good Burden as high as the Borough-town of <hi>Leſtwithiel,</hi> an antient, and once a flouriſhing, but now a decay'd Place, and as to Trade and Navigation quite deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; which is occaſioned by the River being filled up with Sand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leſtwithiel</hi> was called, in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Times, <hi>Pen Uehel Coed,</hi> i. e. an high Place with Wood. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſince the antient Reſidence of the Dukes of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> The Ruins of a Caſtle belonging to them are ſtill to be ſeen, on a riſing Ground, at a little Diſtance from the Town. The Church is an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Edifice; but the Steeple carries the Marks of the Civil Wars in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. when the great Hall and Exchequer of the ſaid Dukes of <hi>Cornwall</hi> were alſo utterly defaced. Some ſay this
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0141100401:351"/>
Town was formerly the County Town and ſtill retains ſeveral Advantages which ſupports its Figure; as, 1. That it is one of the Coinage or Stannary Towns. 2. The common Gaol for the whole Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is here, as are alſo the County Courts for <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a mock Cavalcade kept up at this Town, which is very remarkable; the Particulars, as they are related by Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> in his <hi>Survey</hi> of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> take as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Upon little <hi>Eaſter Sunday,</hi> the Freeholders of this Town and Manor, by themſelves, or their Deputies, did there aſſemble: amongſt whom, one, (as it fell to his Lot by turn) bravely apparell'd, gallantly mounted, with a Crown on his Head, a Sceptre in his Hand, and a Sword borne before him, and dutifully attended by all the reſt, alſo on Horſeback, rode thro' the principal Street to the Church: the Curate in his beſt <hi>Beſeen</hi> ſolemnly received him at the Church-yard Stile, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to hear Divine Service. After which, he repaired with the ſame Pomp to a Houſe provided for that Purpoſe, made a Feaſt to his Attendants, kept the Table's-end himſelf, and was ſerved with kneeling Aſſay, and all other Rights due to the Eſtate of a Prince: with which Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Ceremony ended, and every Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Home again. The Pedigree of this Uſage is deriv'd from ſo many Deſcents of Ages, that the Cauſe and Author out-reach Remembrance. Howbeit, theſe Circumſtances afford a Conjecture, that it ſhould betoken Royalties appertaining to the Honour of <hi>Cornwall.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Behind <hi>Foy,</hi> and nearer to the Coaſt, at the Mouth of a ſmall River, which ſome call <hi>Loe,</hi> tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Authority, ſtand Two Borough-towns op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to one another, bearing the Name of <hi>Eaſt Loe,</hi> and <hi>Weſt Loe.</hi> Theſe are both good trading
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0141100401:352"/>
Towns, and eſpecially for Fiſh; and, which is very particular, are, like <hi>Weymouth</hi> and <hi>Melcomb</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> ſeparated only by the Creek or River; and yet each of them ſends Members to Parliament. Theſe Towns are joined together by a very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſtately Stone Bridge, having 15 Arches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eaſt Loe</hi> was the antienter Corporation of the Two, and ſome Ages ago the greater and more conſiderable Town; but now they tell us <hi>Weſt Loe</hi> is the richeſt, and has the moſt Ships belonging to it; but has neither Church or Chapel, nor Meeting-houſe in it. Were they put together, they would make a very handſome Sea-port Town.</p>
            <p>Paſſing from hence, and ferrying over <hi>Foy</hi> River, we come into a large Country without many Towns in it of Note, but very well furniſhed with Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Seats, and a little higher up with Tin Works.</p>
            <p>The Sea making ſeveral deep Bays here, they who travel by Land are obliged to go higher into the Country, to paſs above the Water, eſpecially at <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardreth-bay,</hi> which lies very broad, above Ten Miles within the Country; which paſſing at <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardreth,</hi> a Town of no great Note, tho' the Bay takes its Name from it, the next Inlet of the Sea is the famous <hi>Firth,</hi> or Inlet, called <hi>Falmouth Haven.</hi> It is certainly, next to <hi>Milford Haven</hi> in <hi>South Wales,</hi> the faireſt and beſt Road for Shipping that is in the whole Iſle of <hi>Britain</hi>; whether we conſider the Depth of Water for above 20 Miles within Land; the Safety of Riding, ſhelter'd from all kind of Winds or Storms; the good Anchorage, and the many Creeks, all navigable, where Ships may run in and be ſafe.</p>
            <p>There are Six or Seven very conſiderable Places upon this <hi>Haven,</hi> and the Rivers from it: <hi>viz. Grampound, Tregony, Truro, Penryn, Falmouth, St. Mawes,</hi> and <hi>Pendennis.</hi> The Four firſt of theſe ſend Members to Parliament; altho' the Town of <hi>Falmouth,</hi> as big as all of them together, <hi>(Truro</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0141100401:353"/>
and richer than Ten ſuch, ſends none. But how ſo conſiderable a Sea-port and Town, comes to be debarr'd that Privilege, doth not appear. 'Tis certain, that a great Number of ſmall inconſiderable Boroughs in this County do now enjoy it; but until the 6th of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. none but <hi>Launceſton, Leskard, Leſtwithiel, Truro, Bodmyn, Helſton,</hi> and <hi>Boſſiney,</hi> ſent any. And whether it were then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the reſt as a Puniſhment, or conferred as a Favour, is uncertain. I cannot agree with thoſe who think it was obtain'd at their Requeſt, by the Intereſt of their Duke, becauſe they were inveſted with it by King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when no Perſon bore that Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Mawes,</hi> and <hi>Pendennis</hi> or <hi>Pen-dinas,</hi> (which ſignifies in the old <hi>Britiſh,</hi> the End or Head of a City) are Two Fortifications placed at the Points, or Entrance, of this <hi>Haven,</hi> oppoſite to one another, tho' not with a Communication or View. They are very ſtrong; the former principally by Sea, having a good Platform of Guns, pointing 'thwart the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and planted on a Level with the Water; but <hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle is ſtrong by Land as well as by Water, is regularly fortified, has good Out-works, and generally a ſtrong Gariſon, and each of them has a Governor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Mawes,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s, has a Town annex'd to the Caſtle, and is a Borough, ſending Members to Parliament; but has neither Church, Chapel, Meeting-houſe, Fair, or Market, in it.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Falmouth</hi> is by much the richeſt, and beſt trading Town in this County, tho' not ſo antient as its Neighbour Town of <hi>Truro</hi>; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is in ſome things obliged to acknowlege its Seigniority, and the <hi>Truro</hi> Men receive ſeveral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties collected in <hi>Falmouth</hi>; particularly Wharfage for the Merchandizes landed, or ſhipped off: but the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0141100401:354"/>
Town of <hi>Falmouth</hi> has gotten the Trade, at leaſt the beſt Part of it, from the other, which is chiefly owing to the Situation; for lying upon the Sea, but within the Entrance, Ships of the greateſt Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den come up to the very Quay, and the whole Royal Navy might ride ſafely in the Road; whereas the Town of <hi>Truro,</hi> lying far within, and at the Mouth of Two freſh Rivers, is not navigable for Veſſels of above 150 Tons, or thereabouts; the Trade at <hi>Truro</hi> being chiefly, if not altogether, for the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off of Block TIN and COPPER Ore, the latter being lately found in large Quantities in ſome of the Mountains between <hi>Truro</hi> and <hi>St. Michael's,</hi> and which is much improv'd ſince the ſeveral Mills are erected at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and other Parts, for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of Battery-ware, as 'tis called.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Falmouth</hi> is well-built, has abundance of Shipping belonging to it, is full of rich Merchants, and has an increaſing Trade, becauſe of the ſetting up of late Years the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Packets between this Port and <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which occaſions a new Commerce between <hi>Portugal</hi> and this Town, amounting to a very great Value.</p>
            <p>It is true, Part of this Trade was founded in a clandeſtine Commerce, carried on by the ſaid Packets at <hi>Lisbon</hi>; where being the King's Ships, and claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Privilege of not being ſearched or viſited by the Cuſtom-houſe Officers, they found Means to carry off great Quantities of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures, which they ſold on Board to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and they convey'd them on Shore, as 'tis ſuppoſed, without paying Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>But the Government there getting Intelligence of it, and Complaint being made in <hi>England</hi> alſo, where it was found to be prejudicial to the fair Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, that Trade has been effectually ſtopp'd; but the <hi>Falmouth</hi> Merchants, having by this means gotten a Taſte of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Trade, have maintained it
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0141100401:355"/>
ever ſince in Ships of their own. Theſe Packets bring over vaſt Quantities of Gold in Specie, either in <hi>Moidores,</hi> or in Bars of Gold, on Account of the Merchants at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cuſtom-houſe for all the Towns in this Port, and the Head-collector, is eſtabliſhed at this Town, where the Duties, including thoſe of the other Ports, are very conſiderable. Here is alſo a very great Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Pilchards,</hi> and the Merchants of <hi>Falmouth</hi> have the chiefeſt Stroke in that gainful Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truro,</hi> tho' it gives Place to <hi>Falmouth,</hi> is however a conſiderable Town. It ſtands up the Water North-and-by-eaſt from <hi>Falmouth,</hi> in the utmoſt extended Branch of the Haven, at the Conflux of Two Rivers, which, tho' not of any long Courſe, have a very good Appearance for a Port, and make a large Wharf between them in the Front of the Town; and the Water here makes a very good Port for ſmall Ships, tho' it be at the Influx, but not for Ships of Burden. There are at leaſt Three Churches in it, but no Diſſenters Meeting-houſe, that I could hear of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tregony,</hi> or <hi>Tregenen,</hi> (which in <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſignifies the Mouth-town) is a Borough-town upon the ſame Water North-eaſt from <hi>Falmouth,</hi> diſtant about 16 Miles from it, but is a Town of very little Trade; nor indeed have any of the Towns ſo far within the Shore, notwithſtanding the Benefit of the Water, any conſiderable Trade, but what is carried on under the Merchants of <hi>Falmouth</hi> or <hi>Truro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grampound</hi> is a Market-town and Borough, about Four Miles farther up the Water. This Place indeed has a Claim to Antiquity, and is an Appendix to the Duchy of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> of which it holds at a Free-farm Rent, and pays to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> as Duke, 10<hi>l.</hi> 11<hi>s.</hi> 1<hi>d. per Annum.</hi> It has no Pariſh-church, but only a Chapel of Eaſe to an adjacent Pariſh. Here are ſome Remains to be ſeen
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0141100401:356"/>
of the famous <hi>Coedfala,</hi> which, in the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Felon-wood,</hi> granted, with all the Lands in it, to the Town, in King <hi>Edward</hi> III.'s Time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penryn,</hi> another Borough-town, is up the ſame Branch of the Haven as <hi>Falmouth,</hi> but ſtands Four Miles higher towards the Weſt, upon a Hill; yet Ships come to it of as great a Size as can come to <hi>Truro.</hi> It is a very pleaſant agreeable Town, and for that Reaſon has many Merchants in it, who would perhaps other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe live at <hi>Falmouth.</hi> The chief Commerce of theſe Towns, as to their Sea-affairs, is the Pilchards, and <hi>Newfoundland</hi> Fiſhing, which is very profitable to them all. It had formerly a Conventual Church, with a Chantry, and a Religious Houſe, a Cell to <hi>Kirton</hi>; but they are all demoliſhed, and ſcarce the Ruins of them diſtinguiſhable enough to know one Part from another. This Town is full of Orchards, and looks like a Town in a Wood. The Sea em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces it on each Side. Its Name is <hi>Britiſh,</hi> as all thoſe Words beginning with <hi>Pen,</hi> and <hi>Tre,</hi> and <hi>Lan,</hi> (which occur often in this County) are.</p>
            <p>Quitting <hi>Falmouth</hi> Haven, from <hi>Penryn</hi> Weſt, we came to <hi>Helſton,</hi> another Borough-town, at about Seven Miles Diſtance: It ſtands upon the little River <hi>Cober,</hi> which however admits the Sea ſo into its Boſom, as to make a tolerable good Harbour for Ships, a little below the Town. It is the Fifth Town allowed for the Coining TIN, and ſeveral of the Ships called <hi>Tin</hi> Ships are laden here.</p>
            <p>This Town is large and populous, and has Four ſpacious Streets, an handſome Church, and a good Trade. Beyond this is a Market-town, tho' of no Reſort for Trade, called <hi>Market-Jew:</hi> it lies indeed on the Sea-ſide, but has no Harbour or ſafe Road for Shipping.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Helford</hi> is a ſmall but good Harbour, between <hi>Falmouth</hi> and this Port, where many times the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0141100401:357"/>
TIN Ships go in to load for <hi>London</hi>; alſo here are a good Number of Fiſhing Veſſels for the <hi>Pilchard</hi> Trade, and abundance of ſkilful Fiſhermen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penſance,</hi> in <hi>Britiſh, Penſand,</hi> i. e. the Head, or End of the Sand, is the fartheſt Town, of any Note, Weſt, being 254 Miles from <hi>London,</hi> and within about Ten Miles of the Promontory called the <hi>Land's-end</hi>; ſo that this Promontory is from <hi>London</hi> 264 Miles, or thereabouts. This is a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-town of good Buſineſs, well-built and populous, has a good Trade, and a great many Ships belonging to it, notwithſtanding it is ſo remote. Here are alſo a great many good Families of Gentlemen, tho' in this utmoſt Angle of the Nation: and, which is yet more ſtrange, the Veins of Lead, Tin, and Copper Ore, are ſaid to be ſeen, even to the utmoſt Extent of Land at Low-water Mark, and in the very Sea. So rich, ſo valuable a Treaſure is contained in theſe Parts of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> tho' they are ſuppoſed to be very poor, becauſe ſo remote from <hi>London,</hi> which is the Centre of our Wealth.</p>
            <p>Between this Town and <hi>St. Burien,</hi> a Town midway between it and the <hi>Land's-end,</hi> ſtands a circular Temple of the <hi>Druids,</hi> conſiſting of 19 Stones, the Diſtance between each being 12 Feet, and a 20th in the Centre, much higher than the reſt; and are not unlike thoſe at <hi>Stonehenge</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi> The Pariſh where they ſtand is called <hi>Biſcard-woune,</hi> from whence the antient and now noble Family of <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cawen</hi> derives its Name.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Cleer</hi> Pariſh in this County, Six or Eight Stones of prodigious Bigneſs likewiſe ſtand up in a Circle; a Monument of the like Nature.</p>
            <p>Theſe are probably, as thoſe at <hi>Stonehenge</hi> and <hi>Burien,</hi> Remains of <hi>Druids</hi> Temples.</p>
            <p>And we ſhall mention in this Place, that at <hi>Stanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> is another Temple of the <hi>Druids,</hi> called <hi>The Weddings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0141100401:358"/>The <hi>Maen-amber,</hi> near this Town of <hi>Penſance,</hi> was alſo a very remarkable Stone, which, as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> tells us, tho' it be of a vaſt Bigneſs, yet might be moved with one Finger, notwithſtanding a great Number of Men could not remove it from its Place. It was deſtroy'd, as one of the ſame Sort was in <hi>Fifeſhire, Scotland,</hi> by one of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors: for theſe Reformers had a Notion of theſe Works being of a ſuperſtitious kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maen</hi> is a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word for a great Stone: There is one of theſe Stones, as Dr. <hi>Stukely</hi> tells us, in <hi>Derbyſhire</hi>; and Mr. <hi>Toland</hi> acquaints us, that there are alſo ſuch in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as <hi>Wales</hi>; he gives the following Account of this Piece of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"At a Place called <hi>Maen-amber,</hi> ſays he, is a Heap of Stones roundiſh, and of vaſt Bulk; but ſo artificially pitch'd on flat Stones, ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer in Number, that touching the great Stone lightly, it moves, and ſeems to totter, to the great Amazement of the Ignorant; but ſtirs not, at leaſt not ſenſibly, when one uſes his whole Strength."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Near <hi>Penſance,</hi> but open to the Sea, is that Gulph they call <hi>Mounts-bay,</hi> named ſo from a high Hill ſtanding in the Water, which they call <hi>St. Michael's Mount</hi>; the Seamen call it only <hi>the Corniſh Mount.</hi> It has been fortify'd, tho' the Situation of it makes it ſo difficult of Acceſs, that, like the <hi>Baſs</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there needs no Fortification. Like the <hi>Baſs</hi> too, it was once made a Gaol for Priſoners of State, but now it is wholly neglected. Here is a very good Road for Shipping, which makes the Town of <hi>Penſance</hi> a Place of good Reſort.</p>
            <p>A little up in the Country towards the North-weſt is <hi>Godolchan,</hi> which tho' a Hill, rather than a Town, gives Name to the antient and now noble Family of <hi>Godolphin</hi>; and nearer on the Northern Coaſt is <hi>Ryalton,</hi> which gives the ſecond Title to the Earl
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0141100401:359"/>
               <hi>Godolphin.</hi> This Place alſo is infinitely rich in <hi>Tin</hi> Mines.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not end this Account at the utmoſt Extent of the Iſland of <hi>Great Britain</hi> Weſt, without viſiting thoſe kind of <hi>Excreſcences</hi> of the Iſland, the Rocks of <hi>Scilly,</hi> where many good Ships are almoſt continually daſhed in Pieces, and many brave Lives loſt, in ſpite of the Mariner's beſt Skill, or the Light-houſes and other Sea-marks beſt Notice.</p>
            <p>Theſe Iſles, called in <hi>Latin, Silurum Inſulae,</hi> are ſuppoſed by ſome to be the <hi>Caſſiterides</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients: they lie about 60 Miles from the <hi>Land's-end,</hi> and are a Cluſter of ſmall Iſlands, to the Number, as ſome reckon, of 145. <hi>Scilly</hi> was once the chief in Eſtimation. But <hi>St. Mary</hi> being the fruitfulleſt and largeſt, tho' but Nine Miles about, has now the Pre-eminence; and it has a very good Harbour, fortify'd with a Caſtle built by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Theſe Iſles were conquer'd by <hi>Athelſtane,</hi> one of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, and from his Time they are deemed a Part of the County of <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Iſlands lie ſo in the Middle between the Two vaſt Openings of the North and South narrow Seas, or, as the Sailors call them, the <hi>Briſtol Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> and <hi>The Chanel,</hi> (ſo called by way of Eminence) that it cannot, or perhaps never will be avoided, but that ſeveral Ships in the Dark of the Night, and in Streſs of Weather, may by being out in their Reckonings, or other unavoidable Accidents, miſtake; and if they do, they are ſure, as the Sailors call it, to run <hi>Bump aſhore</hi> upon <hi>Scilly,</hi> where they find no Quarter among the Breakers; but are beat to pieces, without any Poſſibility of Eſcape.</p>
            <p>One can hardly mention the Rocks of <hi>Scilly,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting fall a Tear to the Memory of Sir <hi>Cloudeſly Shovel,</hi> and all the gallant Spirits with him; who, in the Admiral Ship, with Three Men of War, and all their Men, running upon theſe Rocks, right afore
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0141100401:360"/>
the Wind, in a dark Night, were loſt, and not a Man ſaved, in his Return from a fruitleſs Expedition againſt <hi>Toulon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They tell us of Eleven Sail of Merchant Ships Homeward-bound, and richly laden from the South-ward, who had the like Fate, in the ſame Place, a great many Years ago; and that ſome of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Spain,</hi> and having a great Quantity of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or Pieces of Eight on board, the Money frequently drives on Shore ſtill, and that in good Quantities, eſpecially after ſtormy Weather.</p>
            <p>This may be the Reaſon why, as we obſerved during our ſhort Stay here, ſeveral Mornings after it had blown ſomething hard in the Night, the Sands were covered with Country People, running to and fro to ſee if the Sea had caſt up any thing of value. This the Seamen call <hi>going a ſhoring</hi>; and it ſeems they often find good Purchace. Sometimes alſo dead Bodies are caſt up here, the Conſequence of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecks among thoſe fatal Rocks and Iſlands; as alſo broken Pieces of Ships, Caſks, Cheſts, and almoſt every thing that will float, or roll on Shore by the Surges of the Sea.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſeldom that the ſavage Country People ſcuffle and fight about the Right to what they find, and that in a deſperate manner; ſo that this Part of <hi>Cornwall</hi> may truly be ſaid to be inhabited by a fierce and ravenous People, like thoſe on the Coaſt of <hi>Suſſex</hi>; for they are ſo greedy and eager for Prey, that they are charged with ſtrange, bloody, and cruel Dealings, even ſometimes with one another; but eſpecially with poor diſtreſſed Seamen, when they are forced on Shore by Tempeſts, and ſeek Help for their Lives, and where they find the Rocks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not more mercileſs, than the People who range about them for their Prey.</p>
            <p>Here alſo, as a farther Teſtimony of the immenſe Riches which have been loſt at times upon this Coaſt,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0141100401:361"/>
we found ſeveral Engineers and Projectors with Diving Engines, attempting to recover what had been loſt, and that not always unſucceſsfully.</p>
            <p>From the Tops of the Hills, on this Extremity of the Land, you may ſee out into what they call the <hi>Chaps of the Chanel</hi>; which, as it is the greateſt Inlet of Commerce, and the moſt frequented by Merchant Ships of any Place in the World; ſo one ſeldom looks out to Sea-ward, but ſomething new preſents of Ships paſſing, or repaſſing, either on the great or leſſer Chanel.</p>
            <p>This Point of the <hi>Lizard,</hi> which runs out to the Southward, and the other Promontory mentioned above, make the Two Angles, or Horns, as they are called, from whence 'tis ſuppoſed this Country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its firſt Name of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> or, as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays, <hi>Cornubia</hi> in the <hi>Latin,</hi> and in the <hi>Britiſh, Kerneu,</hi> as running out in two vaſtly extended Horns.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lizard</hi> Point is ſtill more uſeful (tho' not ſo far Weſt) than the other, which is more properly called the <hi>Land's-end,</hi> being more frequently firſt diſcovered from the Sea; and is therefore the general Guide, and the Land which the Ships chuſe to make firſt; being then ſure, that they are paſt <hi>Scilly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nature has fortify'd this Part of the Iſland of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> in a ſtrange manner, and ſo as is worth a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller's Obſervation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there are the Iſlands of <hi>Scilly,</hi> and the Rocks about them; which are placed like Out-works to reſiſt the firſt Aſſaults of this Enemy the Ocean, and ſo break the Force of it; as the Piles or Stirlings (as they are called) are placed before the ſolid Stone-work of <hi>London-bridge,</hi> to fence off the Force, either of the Water, or Ice, or any thing elſe that might be dangerous to the Work.</p>
            <p>Then there are a vaſt Number of <hi>ſunk Rocks,</hi> (ſo the Seamen call them) beſides ſuch as are viſible, and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0141100401:362"/>
above Water; which gradually leſſen the Quantity of Water, that would otherwiſe lie with an infinite Weight and Force upon the Land. 'Tis obſerved, that theſe Rocks lie under Water for a great way off into the Sea on every Side the ſaid Two Horns or Points of Land; ſo breaking the Force of the Water, and leſſening the Weight of it.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, the whole <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> or Body of the Land, which makes this Part of the Iſle of <hi>Britain,</hi> ſeems to be one ſolid Rock, as if it was formed by Nature to reſiſt the otherwiſe irreſiſtible Power of the Ocean. And indeed, if one was to obſerve with what Fury the Sea comes on ſometimes againſt the Shore here, eſpecially at the <hi>Lizard Point,</hi> where there are but few, if any Out-works, (as I call them) to reſiſt it; how high the Waves come rolling forward, ſtorming on the Back of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, particularly when the Wind blows <hi>off Sea,</hi> one would wonder, that even the ſtrongeſt Rocks themſelves ſhould be able to reſiſt and repel them. But, as I ſaid, the Country ſeems to be one great Body of Stone, and prepar'd ſo on purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And yet, as if all this was not enough, Nature has provided another ſtrong Fence, and that is, that theſe vaſt Rocks are, in a manner, cemented toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſolid and weighty Ore of TIN and COP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER, eſpecially the latter, which is plentifully found upon the very outmoſt Edge of the Land, and with which the Stones may be ſaid to be ſolder'd together, leſt the Force of the Sea ſhould ſeparate and disjoint them, and, breaking in upon theſe Fortifications of the Iſland, deſtroy its chief Security.</p>
            <p>This is certain, that there is a more than ordinary Quantity of Tin, Copper, and Lead alſo, fixed by the Great Author of Nature in theſe very remote Angles; ſo that the Ore is found upon the very Surface of the Rocks a good way into the Sea, and does not only lie, as it were, upon or between the Stones among the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0141100401:363"/>
Earth, which in that Caſe might be waſh'd from it by the Sea; but is even blended or mix'd in with the Stones themſelves, ſo that the Stones muſt be ſplit into Pieces to come at it. By this Mixture the Rocks are made exceedingly weighty and ſolid, and thereby ſtill the more qualified to repel the Force of the Sea.</p>
            <p>Upon this remote Part of the Iſland we ſaw great Numbers of that famous kind of <hi>Crows,</hi> which is known by the Name of the <hi>Corniſh Chough:</hi> they are the ſame kind which are found in <hi>Switzerland</hi> among the <hi>Alps,</hi> and which, <hi>Pliny</hi> pretended, were peculiar to thoſe Mountains, and calls the <hi>Pyrrhocorax.</hi> The Body is <hi>Black,</hi> the Legs, Feet, and Bill, of a <hi>Yellow,</hi> almoſt to a <hi>Red.</hi> I could not find, that it was affected for any good Quality it had, nor is the Fleſh good to eat, for it feeds much on Fiſh and Carrion; it is counted little better than a Kite, for it is of a ravenous Quality, and is very miſchievous; it will ſteal and carry away any think it finds about the Houſe, that is not too heavy, tho' not fit for its Food; as Knives, Forks, Spoons and Linen Cloths, or whatever it can fly away with; ſometimes, they ſay, it has ſtolen Bits of Firebrands, or lighted Candles, and lodged them in the Stacks of Corn, and the Thatch of Barns and Houſes, and ſet them on Fire.</p>
            <p>I might take up many Sheets in deſcribing the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Curioſities of this little <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi> called the <hi>Land's-end,</hi> in which lies an immenſe Treaſure, and many Things worth Notice, beſides thoſe to be found upon the Surface: but I am too near the End of this Letter. If I have Opportunity, I ſhall take Notice of ſome Part of what I omit here, in my Return by the Northern Shore of the County. In the mean time,</p>
