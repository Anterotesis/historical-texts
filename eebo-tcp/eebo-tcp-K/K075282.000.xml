            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY.</head>
            <p>THOMAS GRAY was born in Cornhill, in the
city of London, on the 26th of December, 1716.
His father, Philip Gray, was a money-ſcrivener; but
being of an indolent and profuſe diſpoſition, he rather
diminiſhed than improved his paternal fortune. Our
Author received his claſſical education at Eton ſchool,
under Mr. Antrobus, his mother's brother, a man
of ſound learning and refined taſte, who directed his
nephew to thoſe purſuits which laid the foundation of
his future literary fame.</p>
            <p>During his continuance at Eton, he contracted a
friendſhip with Mr. Horace Walpole, well known for
his knowledge in the fine arts; and Mr. Richard
Weſt, ſon of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, a youth
of very promiſing talents.</p>
            <p>When he left Eton ſchool in 1734, he went to
Cambridge, and entered a penſioner at Peterhouſe, at
the recommendation of his uncle Antrobus, who had
been a fellow of that college. It is ſaid that, from
his effeminacy and fair complexion, he acquired,
among his fellow ſtudents, the appellation of <hi>Miſs</hi>
Gray, to which the delicacy of his manners ſeems not
a little to have contributed. Mr. Walpole was at
that time a fellow-commoner of King's College, in the
ſame Univerſity; a fortunate circumstance, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
Gray frequent opportunities of intercourſe with
his Honourable Friend.</p>
            <p>Mr. Weſt went from Eton to Chriſt Church. Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;
and in this ſtate of ſeparation, theſe two vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of the Muſes, whoſe diſpoſitions were conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
commenced an epiſtolary correſpondence, part of
which is publiſhed by Mr. Maſon, a gentleman whoſe
character ſtands high in the republic of letters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0096400300:5"/>
Gray, having imbibed a taſte for poetry, did not
reliſh thoſe abſtruſe ſtudies which generally occupy
the minds of ſtudents at College; and therefore, as he
found very little gratification from academical purſuits,
he left Cambridge in 1738, and returned to London,
intending to apply himſelf to the ſtudy of the law:
but this intention was ſoon laid aſide, upon an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given him by Mr. Walpole, to accompany him
in his travels abroad; a ſituation highly preferable,
in Gray's opinion, to the dry study of the law.</p>
            <p>They ſet out together for France, and viſited most
of the places worthy of notice in that country: from
thence they proceeded to Italy, where an unfortunate
diſpute taking place between them, a ſeparation enſued
upon their arrival at Florence. Mr. Walpole after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
with great candour and liberality, took upon
himſelf the blame of the quarrel; though, if we
conſider the matter coolly and impartially, we may be
induced to conclude that Gray, from a conſcious ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of ability, might have claimed a deference
to his opinion and judgment, which his Honourable
Friend was not at that time diſpoſed to admit: the
rupture, however, was very unpleaſant to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Gray purſued his journey to Venice on an economic
plan, ſuitable to the circumſcribed state of his finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and having continued there ſome weeks, returned
to England in September, 1741. He appears, from
his letters, publiſhed by Mr. Maſon, to have paid the
minuteſt attention to every object worthy of notice
throughout the courſe of his travels. His deſcriptions
are lively and pictureſque, and bear particular marks
of his genius and diſpoſition. We admire the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity
of his ideas when he aſcends the ſtupendous
heights of the Alps, and are charmed with his diſplay
of nature, decked in all the beauties of vegetation.
Indeed, abundant information, as well as entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may be derived from his caſual letters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0096400300:6"/>
In about two months after his arrival in England,
he loſt his father, who, by an indiſcreet profuſion, had
ſo impaired his fortune, as not to admit of his son's
proſecuting the ſtudy of the law with that degree of
reſpectability which the nature of the profeſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
without becoming burthenſome to his mother
and aunt. To obviate, therefore, their importunities
on the ſubject, he went to Cambridge, and took his
bachelor's degree in civil law.</p>
            <p>But the inconveniencies and diſtreſs attached to a
ſcanty fortune were not the only ills our Poet had to
encounter at this time: he had not only loſt the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Mr. Walpole abroad, but poor Weſt, the
partner of his heart, fell a victim to complicated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,
brought on by family misfortunes, on the 1ſt
of June, 1742, at Popes, a village, in Hertfordſhire,
where he went for the benefit of the air.</p>
            <p>The exceſſive degree in which his mind was agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the loſs of his friend, will beſt appear from the
following beautiful little sonnet:
<q>
                  <l>" In vain to me the ſmiling mornings ſhine,</l>
                  <l>" And redd'ning Poebus lifts his go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>" A different object do theſe eyes require;</l>
                  <l>" My lonely anguiſh melts no heart but mine,</l>

                  <l>" To warn their little loves the birds comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ain:</l>
                  <l>" I fruitleſs mourn to him that cannot hear;</l>
                  <l>" And weep the more, becauſe I weep in vain.'</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Gray now ſeems to have applied his mind very
ſedulouſly to poetical compoſition: his <hi>Ode to Spring</hi>
was written early in June, to his friend Mr. Weſt,
before he received the melancholy news of his death:
how our Poet's ſuſceptible mind was affected by that
melancholy incident, is evidently demonſtrated by the
lines quoted above; the impreſſion, indeed, appears
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0096400300:7"/>
to have been too deep to be ſoon effaced; and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the ſubjects which called for the exertions of his
poetical talents ſubſequent to the production of this
Ode, corroborates that obſervation; theſe were his
<hi>Proſpect of Eton,</hi> and his <hi>Ode to Adverſity.</hi> It is alſo
ſuppoſed, and with great probability, that he began
his <hi>Elegy in a Country Church Yard</hi> about the ſame
time. He paſſed ſome weeks at Stoke, near Windſor,
where his mother and aunt reſided, and in that pleaſing
retirement finiſhed ſeveral of his moſt celebrated
Poems.</p>
            <p>From thence he returned to Cambridge, which,
from this period, was his chief reſidence during the
remainder of his life. The conveniencies with which
a college life was attended, to a perſon of his narrow
fortune, and ſtudious turn of mind, were more than
a compenſation for the diſlike which, for ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
he bore to the place: but he was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to his ſituation, on Mr. Maſon's being elected
a fellow of Pembroke-Hall; a circumſtance which
brought him a companion, who, during life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for him the highest degree of friendſhip and
eſteem.</p>
            <p>In 1742 he was admittted to the degree of Batchelor
in the Civil Law, as appears from a letter written to
his particular friend Dr. Wharton, of Old Park,
near Durham, formerly fellow of Pembroke Hall,
Cambridge, in which he ridicules, with much point
and humour, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>lies and foibles, and the dullneſs
and formality, which prevailed in the Univerſity.</p>
            <p>In order to enrich his mind with the ideas of others,
he devoted a conſiderable portion of his time to the
ſtudy of the beſt Greek authors; ſo that, in the courſe
or ſix years, there were hardly any writers of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
in that language whoſe works he had not only
read, but thoroughly digeſted.</p>
            <p>His attention, however, to the Greek claſſics, did
not wholly engroſs his time; for he found leiſure
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0096400300:8"/>
to advert, in a new ſarcaſtical manner, to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

only a fragment remaining of what he had written on
this ſubject, from which it may be inferred, that it
was intended as an <hi>Hymn to Ignorance.</hi> The fragment
is wholly introductory; yet many of the lines are ſo
pointed in ſignification, and harmonious in verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they will be admitted, by the admirers of
verſe, to diſplay his poetical talents with more bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy
than appears in many of his lyric productions.</p>

In 1744 he ſeems to have given up his attention to
the Muſes. Mr. Walpole, deſirous of preſerving
what he had already written, as well as perpetuating
the merit of their deceaſed friend, Weſt, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to prevail with Gray, to whom he had previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
become reconciled, to publiſh his own Poems,
together with thoſe of Weſt; but Gray declined it,
conceiving their productions united would not ſuffice
to fill even a ſmall volume.</p>
            <p>In 1747 Gray became acquainted with Mr. Maſon,
then a ſcholar of St. John's College, and afterwards
Fellow of Pembroke Hall. Mr. Maſon, who was
a man of great learning and ingenuity, had written,
the year before, his "Monody on the Death of Pope,"
and his "II Bellicoſo," and "Il Pacifico;" and Gray
reviſed theſe pieces at the requeſt of a friend. This
laid the foundation of a friendſhip that terminated
but with life: and Mr. Maſon, after the death of
Gray, teſtified his regard for him, by ſuperintending
the publication of his works.</p>
            <p>The ſame year he wrote a little Ode on the Death
of a favourite Cat of Mr. Walpole's, in which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and inſtruction are happily blended: but the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
year he produced an effort of much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
the Fragment of an <hi>Eſſay on the Alliance of
Education and Government.</hi> Its tendency was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the neceſſary concurrence of both to form
great and uſeful Men. It opens with the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſimilies. The exordium is rather uncommon;
but he ſeems to have adopted it as a kind of clue to
the ſubject he meant to purſue in the ſubſequent part
of the Poem.</p>

finiſh what was ſo ſucceſsfully begun, as the Fragment

            <p>In 1750 he put his finiſhing ſtroke to his <hi>Elegy writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in a Country Church-yard,</hi> which was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
first to his friend Mr. Walpole, and by him to
many perſons of rank and diſtinction. This beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
production introduced the author to the favour of
Lady Cobham, and gave occaſion to a ſingular compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0096400300:12"/>
called, <hi>A Long Story</hi>; in which various effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of wit and humour are very happily interſperſed.</p>
            <p>The Elegy having found its way into the "Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
of Magazines," the Author wrote to Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole,
requeſting he would put it into the hands of Mr.
Dodſley, and order him to print it immediately, in
order to reſcue it from the diſgrace it might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
by its appearance in a Magazine. The Elegy
was the moſt popular of all our Author's productions;
it ran through eleven editions, and was tranſlated
into Latin by Anſtey and Roberts; and in the ſame
year a verſion of it was publiſhed by Lloyd. Mr.
Bentley, an eminent Artiſt of that time, wiſhing to
decorate this elegant compoſition with every ornament
of which it is so highly deſerving, drew for it a set of
deſigns, as he alſo did for the reſt of Gray's

for which the artiſt was liberally repaid by the
Author in ſome beautiful Stanzas, but unfortunately

            <p>It appears, by a letter to Dr. Wharton, that Gray
finiſhed his Ode on the <hi>Progreſs of Poetry</hi> early in 1755.
The <hi>Bard</hi> alſo was begun about the ſame time; and
the following beautiful Fragment on the <hi>Pleaſure ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
from Viciſſitude</hi> the next year. The merit of the
two former pieces was not immediately perceived, nor
generally acknowledged. Garrick wrote a few lines
in their praiſe. Lloyd and Colman wrote, in concert,
two Odes to "Oblivion" and "Obſcurity," in which
they were ridiculed with much ingenuity.</p>

            <p>Our Author's reputation, as a Poet, was ſo high,
that, on the death of Colley Cibber, in 1757, he had
the honour of refuſing the office of Poet-Laureat, to
which he was probably induced by the diſgrace brought
upon it through the inability of ſome who had filled it.</p>
            <p>His curioſity ſome time after drew him away from
Cambridge to a lodging near the Britiſh Muſeum,
where he reſided near three years, reading and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing.</p>
            <p>In 1762, on the death of Mr. Turner, Profeſſor
of Modern Languages and Hiſtory at Cambridge, he
was, according to his own expreſſion, "cockered and
ſpirited up" to apply to Lord Bute for the ſucceſſion.
His Lordſhip refuſed him with all the politeneſs of a
courtier, the office having been previouſly promiſed to
Mr. Brocket, the tutor of Sir James Lowther.</p>
            <p>His health being on the decline, in 1765 he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
a journey to Scotland, conceiving he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
benefit from exerciſe and change of ſituation.
His account of that country, as far as it extends, is
curious and elegant; for as his mind was comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
it was employed in the contemplation of all the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0096400300:15"/>
works of art, all the appearances of nature, and all
the monuments of paſt events.</p>
            <p>During his ſtay in Scotland, he contracted a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with Dr. Beattie, in whom he found, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
expreſſes it, a poet, a philoſopher, and a good
man. Through the intervention of his friend the
Doctor, the Mariſchal College at Aberdeen offered
him the degree of Doctor of Laws, which he thought
it decent to decline, having omitted to take it at
Cambridge.</p>
            <p>In December, 1767, Dr. Beattie, ſtill deſirous that
his country ſhould leave a memento of its regard to
the merit of our Poet, ſolicited his permiſſion to
print, at the Univerſity of Glaſgow, an elegant edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his works. Gray could not comply with his
friend's requeſt, as he had given his promiſe to Mr.
Dodſley. However, as a compliment to them both,
he preſented them with a copy, containing a few
notes, and the imitations of the old Norwegian poetry,
intended to ſupplant the Long Story, which was printed
at firſt to illuſtrate Mr. Bentley's deſigns.</p>
            <p>In 1768 our Author obtained that office without
ſolicitation, for which he had before applied without
effect. The Profeſſorſhip of Languages and Hiſtory
again became vacant, and he received an offer of it
from the Duke of Grafton, who had ſucceeded Lord
Bute in office. The place was valuable in itſelf, the
ſalary being 400l. a year; but it was rendered peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
acceptable to Mr. Gray, as he obtained it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſolicitation.</p>
            <p>Soon after he ſucceeded to this office, the impaired
ſtate of his health rendered another journey neceſſary;
and he viſited, in 1769, the counties of Weſtmoreland
and Cumberland. His remarks on the wonderful
ſcenery which theſe northern regions diſplay, he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in epiſtolary journals to his friend, Dr. Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
which abound, according to Mr. Maſon's elegant
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0096400300:16"/>
diction, with all the wildneſs of Salvator, and the
ſoftneſs of Claude.</p>
            <p>He appears to have been much affected by the anxiety
he felt at holding a place without diſcharging the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
annexed to it. He had always deſigned reading
lectures, but never put it in practice; and a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of this neglect contributed not a little to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the malady under which he had long laboured:
nay, the office at length became ſo irkſome, that he
ſeriouſly propoſed to reſign it.</p>
            <p>Towards the cloſe of May, 1771, he removed from
Cambridge to London, after having ſuffered violent
attacks of an hereditary gout, to which he had long
been ſubject, notwithſtanding he had obſerved the moſt
rigid abſtemiouſneſs throughout the whole courſe of
his life. By the advice of his phyſicians, he removed
from London to Kenſington; the air of which place
proved ſo ſalutary, that he was ſoon enabled to return
to Cambridge, whence he deſigned to make a viſit to
his friend Dr. Wharton, at Old Park, near Durham;
indulging a fond hope that the excurſion would tend
to the re-eſtabliſhment of his health: but, alas! that
hope proved deluſive. On the 24th of July he was
ſeized, while at dinner in the College hall, with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
nauſea, which obliged him to retire to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
The gout had fixed on his ſtomach in ſuch a
degree as to reſiſt all the powers of medicine. On the
29th he was attacked with a ſtrong convulſion, which
returned with increaſed violence the enſuing day; and
on the evening of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he departed
this life in the 55th year of his age.</p>
            <p>From the narrative of his friend, Mr. Maſon, it
appears, that Gray was actuated by motives of ſelf
improvement, and ſelf gratification, in his application
to the Muſes, rather than any view to pecuniary emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument.
His purſuits were in general diſintereſted;
and as he was free from avarice on the one hand, ſo
was he from extravagance on the other; being one of
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0096400300:17"/>
thoſe few characters in the annals of literature, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the poetical claſs, who are devoid of ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and at the ſame time attentive to economy; but
Mr. Maſon adds, that he was induced to decline tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any advantage of his literary productions by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of pride, which influenced him to diſdain the idea
of being thought an author by profeſſion.</p>
            <p>It appears, from the ſame narrative, that Gray
made conſiderable progreſs in the ſtudy of architecture,
particularly the gothic. He endeavoured to trace this
branch of the ſcience, from the period of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement,
through its various changes, till it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at its perfection in the time of Henry VIII.
He applied himſelf alſo to the ſtudy of heraldry, of
which he obtained a very competent knowledge, as
appears from his <hi>Remarks on Saxon Churches,</hi> in the
introduction to Mr. Bentham's <hi>Hiſtory of Ely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the favourite ſtudy of Gray, for the laſt two
years of his life, was natural hiſtory, which he rather
reſumed than began, as he had acquired ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of botany in early life, while he was under the
tuition of his uncle Antrobus. He wrote copious
marginal notes to the works of Linnaeus, and other
writers in the three kingdoms of nature: and Mr.
Maſon further obſerves, that, excepting pure mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,
and the ſtudies dependent on that ſcience,
there was hardly any part of human learning in which
he had not acquired a competent ſkill; in moſt of them
a conſummate maſtery.</p>
            <p>Mr. Maſon has declined drawing any formal charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of him; but has adopted one from a letter to
James Boſwell, Eſq. by the Rev. Mr. Temple, Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of St. Gluvias, in Cornwall, firſt printed anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
in the London Magazine, which, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
authentic, from the ſanction of Mr. Maſon, we
ſhall therefore tranſcribe.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">Perhaps he was the moſt learned man in Europe.
He was equally acquainted with the elegant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
parts of ſcience, and that not ſuperficially, but
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0096400300:18"/>
thoroughly. He knew every branch of hiſtory, both
natural and civil; had read all the original hiſtorians
of England, France, and Italy; and was a great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarian.
Criticiſm, metaphyſics, morals, and politics,
made a principal part of his ſtudy; voyages and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
of all ſorts were his favourite amuſements; and
he had a fine taſte in painting, prints, architecture,
and gardening. With ſuch a fund of knowledge, his
converſation muſt have been equally inſtructive and
entertaining; but he was alſo a good man, a man of
virtue and humanity. There is no character without
ſome ſpeck, ſome imperfection; and I think the greateſt
defect in his was an affectation in delicacy, or rather
effeminacy, and a viſible faſtidiouſneſs, or contempt and
diſdain of his inferiors in ſcience. He alſo had, in
ſome degree, that weakneſs which diſguſted Voltaire
ſo much in Mr. Congreve: though he ſeemed to value
others chiefly according to the progreſs they had made
in knowledge, yet he could not bear to be conſidered
himſelf merely as a man of letters; and though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
birth, or fortune, or ſtation, his deſire was to be
looked upon as a private independent gentleman, who
read for his amuſement. Perhaps it may be ſaid, What
ſignifies ſo much knowledge, when it produced ſo little?
Is it worth taking ſo much pains to leave no memorial
but a few Poems? But let it be conſidered that Mr.
Gray was, to others, at leaſt innocently employed;
to himſelf, certainly beneficially. His time paſſed
agreeably; he was every day making ſome new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
in ſcience; his mind was enlarged, his heart
ſoftened, his virtue ſtrengthened; the world and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
were ſhewn to him without a maſk; and he was
taught to conſider every thing as trifling, and unworthy
of the attention of a wiſe man, except the purſuit of
knowledge and practice of virtue, in that ſtate wherein
God hath placed us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to this character, Mr. Maſon has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
that Gray's effeminacy was affected moſt
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0096400300:19"/>
before thoſe whom he did not wiſh to pleaſe; and that
he is unjuſtly charged with making knowledge his
ſole reaſon of preference, as he paid his eſteem to none
whom he did not likewiſe believe to be good.</p>
            <p>Dr. Johnſon makes the following obſervations:—
<q rend="inline">What has occurred to me, from the ſlight inſpection
of his letters, in which my undertaking has engaged
me, is, that his mind had a large graſp; that his
curioſity was unlimited, and his judgment cultivated;
that he was a man likely to love much where he loved
at all, but that he was faſtidious, and hard to pleaſe.
His contempt, however, is often employed, where I
hope it will be approved, upon ſcepticiſm and inſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
His ſhort account of Shafteſbury I will inſert.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">You ſay you cannot conceive how lord Shaſteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
came to be a philoſopher in vogue; I will tell
you: firſt, he was a lord; ſecondly, he was as vain
as any of his readers; thirdly, men are very prone to
believe what they do not underſtand; fourthly, they
will believe any thing at all, provided they are under
no obligation to believe it; fifthly, they love to take
a new road, even when that road leads no where;
ſixthly, he was reckoned a fine writer, and ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to mean more than he ſaid. Would you have
any more reaſons? An interval of above forty years has
pretty well deſtroyed the charm. A dead lord ranks
with commoners: vanity is no longer intereſted in the
matter; for a new road is become an old one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As a writer he had this peculiarity, that he did not
write his pieces firſt rudely, and then correct them,
but laboured every line as it aroſe in the train of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
and he had a notion not very peculiar, that
he could not write but at certain times, or at happy
moments; a fantaſtic foppery, to which our kindneſs
for a man of learning and of virtue wiſhes him to
have been ſuperior.</p>
            <p>As a Poet he ſtands high in the eſtimation of the
candid and judicious. His works are not numerous;
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0096400300:20"/>
but they bear the marks of intenſe application, and
careful reviſion. The Elegy in the Churchyard is
deemed his maſter-piece; the ſubject is intereſting, the
ſentiment ſimple and pathetic, and the verſification
charmingly melodious. This beautiful compoſition
has been often ſelected by orators for the diſplay of
their rhetorical talents. But as the moſt finiſhed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of the human mind have not eſcaped cenſure,
the works of our Author have undergone illiberal
comments. His Elegy has been ſuppoſed defective in
want of plan. Dr. Knox, in his Eſſays, has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<q rend="inline">that it is thought by ſome to be no more
than a confuſed heap of ſplendid ideas, thrown toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without order and without proportion.</q> Some
paſſages have been cenſured by Kelly in the <hi>Babbler</hi>;
and imitations of different authors have been pointed
out by other critics. But theſe imitations cannot be
aſcertained, as there are numberleſs inſtances of coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence
of ideas; ſo that it is difficult to ſay, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
what is or is not a deſigned or accidental imitation.</p>
            <p>Gray, in his Elegy in the Church-yard, has great
merit in adverting to the moſt intereſting paſſions of
the human mind; yet his genius is not marked alone
by the tender ſenſibility ſo conſpicuous in that elegant
piece; but there is a ſublimity which gives it an equal
claim to univerſal admiration.</p>
            <p>His Odes on <hi>The Progreſs of Poetry,</hi> and of <hi>The
Bard,</hi> according to Mr. Maſon's account, <q rend="inline">breathe
the high ſpirit of lyric enthuſiaſm. The tranſitions
are ſudden and impetuous; the language full of fire
and force; and the imagery carried, without impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
to the moſt daring height. They have been
accuſed of obſcurity: but the one can be obſcure to
thoſe only who have not read Pindar; and the other
only to thoſe who are unacquainted with the hiſtory of
our own nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of his other lyric pieces, Mr. Wakefield, a learned
and ingenious commentator, obſerves, that, though,
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0096400300:21"/>
like all other human productions, they are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their defects, yet the ſpirit of poetry, and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
charms of the verſe, are more then a compenſation
for thoſe defects. The Ode on <hi>Eton College</hi> abounds
with ſentiments natural, and conſonant to the feelings
of humanity, exhibited with perſpicuity of method,
and in elegant, intelligible, and expreſſive language.
The Sonnet on <hi>the Death of Weſt,</hi> and the Epitaph on
Sir <hi>William Williams,</hi> are as perfect compoſitions of
the kind as any in our language.</p>
            <p>Dr. Johnſon was confeſſedly a man of great genius;
but the partial and uncandid mode of criticiſm he
has adopted in his remarks on the writings of Gray,
has given to liberal minds great and juſt offence. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. Maſon's account, he has ſubjected
Gray's poetry to the moſt rigorous examination. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
all conſideration of the general plan and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the pieces, he has confined himſelf ſolely to
ſtrictures on words and forms of expreſſion; and Mr.
Maſon very pertinently adds, that <hi>verbal</hi> criticiſm is
an ordeal which the moſt perfect compoſition cannot
paſs without injury.</p>
            <p>He has alſo fallen under Mr. Wakefield's ſevereſt
cenſure. This commentator affirms, that <q rend="inline">he thinks
a refutation of his ſtrictures upon Gray a neceſſary
ſervice to the public, without which they might ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with a malignant influence upon the national taſte.
His cenſure, however, is too general, and expreſſed
with too much vehemence; and his remarks betray,
upon the whole, an unreaſonable faſtidiouſneſs of taſte,
and an unbecoming illiberality of ſpirit. He appears
to have turned an unwilling eye upon the beauties of
Gray, becauſe his jealouſy would not ſuffer him to
ſee ſuch ſuperlative merit in a cotemporary.</q> Theſe
remarks of Mr. Wakefield appear to be well founded;
and it has been obſerved, by another writer, that
Dr. Johnſon, being ſtrongly influenced by his politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and religious principles, was inclined to treat with
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0096400300:22"/>
the utmoſt ſeverity ſome of the productions of our
beſt writers; to which may be imputed that ſeverity
with which he cenſures the lyric performances of Gray.
It is highly probable that no one poetical reader will
univerſally ſubſcribe to his deciſions, though all may
admire his vaſt intuitive knowledge, and power of
diſcrimination.</p>
            <p>In the firſt copy of this exquiſite Poem, Mr. Maſon
obſerves, the concluſion was different from that which
the Author afterwards compoſed; and though his
after-thought was unqueſtionably the beſt, yet there
is a pathetic melancholy in the four ſtanzas that were
rejected, following, "With incenſe kindled at the
Muſes' flame," which highly claim preſervation.</p>

ſome Specimens of the Style that reigned in ancient Times among the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations, or thoſe who had ſubdued the greater Part of this Iſland, and
were our Progenitors: the following three Imitations made a Part of them. He
afterwards dropped his Deſign; eſpecially after he had head that it was already
in the Hands of a Perſon well qualified to do it Juſtice both by his Taſte and his
Reſearches into Antiquity.</p>

                  <p>IN the 11th Century, Sigurd, Earl of the Orkney Iſlands, went with a Fleet
of Ships and a conſiderable Body of Troops, into Ireland, to the Aſſiſtance of
Sigtryg with the ſilken Beard, who was then making War on his Father-in Law,
Brian, King of Dublin. The Earl and all his Forces were cut to Pieces, and
Sigtryg was in Danger of a total Defeat; but the Enemy had a greater Loſs
by the Death of Brian, their King, who fell in the Action. On Chriſtmas-day
(the Day of the Battle) a Native of Caithneſs in Scotland, ſaw, at a Diſtance,
a Number of Perſons on Horſeback riding full ſpeed towards a Hill, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eeming
to enter into it. Curioſity led him to follow them, till, looking through an opening
in the Rocks, he ſaw Twelve gigantic Figures, reſembling Women: they were all
employed about a Loom; and as they wove they ſung the following dreadful Song,
which, when they had finiſhed, they tore the Web into twelve Pieces, and each
taking her Portion, gallopped six to the North, and as many to the South.</p>

to introduce her to it. Theſe two ladies waited upon the Author at his

at home, they left a card behind them. Mr. Gray, ſurpriſed at ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment,
returned the viſit; and as the beginning of this intercourſe bore ſome
appearance of romance, he gave the humorous and lively account of it which
