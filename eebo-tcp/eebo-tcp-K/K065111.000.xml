            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THOUGH <hi>Walton</hi> Water, is here held out, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the ſame Properties and Medicinal Powers as <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham</hi> Water, it is not done with the moſt diſtant View, to leſſen the Reputation of that Water, and the Reſort to <hi>Cheltenham.</hi> On the contrary, it is preſumed, it will be a Satisfaction to Invalids to be aſſured of having within a ſmall Diſtance, a Water of the ſame Kind, to which recourſe may be had, when the Numbers are ſo great at <hi>Chelten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as to be inſufficiently ſupplied from the Well there.</p>
            <p>In this point of View, the Water near <hi>Tewkeſbury</hi> muſt be uſeful to <hi>Cheltenham</hi> in full Seaſons, and, cannot injure it in any one, at its priority in uſe, and, the habit of Reſort for Amuſement, as well as Health, will give <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham</hi> the Preference.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tewkeſbury,</hi> however, has equally a Right to the Benefit of its natural Riches, and to the Advantages which may accrue to it from the Vicinity of <hi>Walton</hi> Waters in particular. This Borough is ſituated on a fertile Plain, at the Conflux of the River <hi>Avon</hi> with the <hi>Severn.</hi> The Town is well built, and now well paved, and, Proviſions of every Kind, particularly the fineſt Salmon, are in great
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1270300500:3"/>plenty. It communicates by a very good Road, to fine rides towards <hi>Worceſter, Upton,</hi> and <hi>Malvern,</hi> and is only nine Miles from <hi>Cheltenham.</hi>
            </p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AT length, I ſend you, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Experiments, made on the Medicinal Water near Tewkeſbury, of which, ſo much has been ſaid at Cheltenham, in the courſe of this Seaſon and the laſt.</p>
            <p>I FIRST heard of this Water in paſſing through Tewkeſbury in 1786. It had been for ſome time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to, by Perſons in the Neighbourhood, and, was reported to have effected Cures in the Diſeaſes for which Cheltenham Water is ſound to be ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and, on account of which, Perſons of every Rank, reſort to that Place in ſuch Numbers, as to exhauſt ſometimes the Spring on which they reſt their hopes of recovery.</p>
            <p>THIS Well is ſituated near Walton, a Village about a mile from Tewkeſbury, upon an Eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Nicholas Smithſend, Eſquire. The Ground about the Well is a deep Clay Soil, under which, at the depth of about ſeven or eight yards, runs a Stratum of blue ſlaty Stone; on piercing this Bed of Stone, plentiful Springs of Water ariſe, which are always more or leſs impregnated with Salt.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1270300500:5"/>
            <p>THE Well, of which I write, is about twenty feet deep.</p>
            <p>THE Water from the Pump, or ſoon after, hasa ſoft, almoſt Oleaginous taſte, numerous Air Bubbles riſe, and ſparkle in the Glaſs; after it has been drank, it leaves the Chalybeate, and Saline taſtes on the tongue, and when ſhook in the Bottle, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patic ſmell is very perceptible.</p>
            <p>ITS reſemblance in taſte, and other appearances to the Cheltenham Water, ſtrikes every one who makes the compariſon.</p>
            <p>ITS operation on the Body, alſo, is exactly the ſame, a Pint or more, acts as a gentle Laxative and Diuretic: And it occaſions a ſlight giddineſs in ſome perſons, in others a ſort of heavy pain in the head.</p>
            <p>THESE teſts, though of themſelves, ſufficiently convincing, will be confirmed by the Experiments which I made on the Walton Water, in the Summer of 1786, and this Summer, in which I had the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the worthy Surgeons and Apothecaries, at Tewkeſbury. 1. When the Walton Water is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Clear ſiltered Lime Water, it becomes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cloudy, and, a copious white ſcaly preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation enſues.</p>
            <p>THE ſame cloudy appearance ariſes in Lime Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the Air, ſeparated by Heat from the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Water, is conveyed by a Pipe and Bladder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1270300500:6"/>with the two Bottles, into the Bottle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Lime Water, and ſhaken with it.</p>
            <p>IF the Walton Water has been taken from the Well, twelve or more hours, the precipitation by Lime Water, does not take place immediately, in the manner it does in a Glaſs of Water from the Pump.</p>
            <p>WHITE Arſenic, diſſolves more readily in the Walton Water, than in common Water, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Hepatic ſmell thereof, ſtronger and more perceptible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHEN Walton Water, freſh from the Pump, is mixed with an Infuſion of Green Tea, the mixture aſſumes a Purple Colour, and by ſtanding, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour becomes deeper,</p>
            <p n="3">3. SOLUTION of Saccharum Saturni, mixed with freſh drawn Water, becomes brown, and is followed by a blackiſh precipitation. This is a teſt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Hepatic Air, which alſo diſcovers itſelf in this Water, by its characteriſtic Sulphureous ſmell. This often is produced by putrifying Vegetables. Biſhop Watſon, obſerves, that Sulphureous Waters are produced in Moraſſes and Bogs, from rotten Wood; that Shale, a ſtone ſo called, of which there is a Stratum, extended all over the Country about Harrowgate, and from which the Sulphur Springs there ariſe, contains both Vitriolic Acid and Phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſton, the conſtituent parts of Sulphur; and ſome
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1270300500:7"/>pieces of Shale, when calcined properly, have been found to communicate the Sulphureous impregnation to Water, Ph. Tranſ. 1786. It is ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Walton Water emerges from a bed of ſtone, and, of a blue Sulphureous ſoft Pyrites, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſimilar to this, and that the Soil abounds with the remains of rotten Vegetables reſolved into it, and that from one or both theſe ſources, it derives the Hepatic Gas perceived in it.</p>
            <p>THE blue Sulphureous Pyrites found in digging the Ground in the Field belonging to the Well-houſe near Walton, has exactly the ſame appearance and properties as that dug, to make a New Well, near Fauconberg-houſe, by order of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. AFTER Walton Water has been drawn from the Pump ten or twelve hours; it no longer becomes purple or blackiſh, by the addition of aſtringents, (No. II.) and a precipitation with Lime Water, does not immediately enſue, (No. I.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. ITS Colour neither becomes Green nor Red, with Syrup of Violets.</p>
            <p n="6">6. IT does not efferveſce with the Vitriolic or Nitrous Acids.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IT becomes milky by mixture, with the fixed Alkali, and more ſo with the Volatile Alkali pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Lime.</p>
            <p n="8">8. SOLUTION of Silver, makes it milky and a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky precipitation ſubſides.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1270300500:8"/>
            <p n="9">9. TWO ingenious friends, and accurate obſervers, found the whole fixed contents of the Water left by evaporation, amounted to one ounce in a gallon.</p>
            <p n="10">10 AFTER various evaporations, I found it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exactly that quantity.</p>
            <p>WHEN a Gallon of the Water is reduced by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration to two ounces and under, a conſiderable quantity of an earthy powder remains in the veſſel in which it was boiled. And when the liquid is ſet to cry ſtalliſe, Cryſtals, in ſhape and ſize, reſembling the Vitriolated Magneſia are formed. They are hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal, and when dried in the Sun, are calcined into a white powder. The taſte cool and bitter.</p>
            <p>SOME cubical Cryſtals of marine ſalt, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqueſcent bitter lixivium remain.</p>
            <p>THE powder, dropped by boiling in the veſſel, conſiſts of Magneſia, and an abſorbent earth, which entirely diſſolve in Vinegar, with conſiderable eſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence.</p>
            <p>THE quantity of large Cryſtals amounted to ſix drachms or more, from a Gallon of Water, evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in 1786; but, by after experiments, I find this impregnation is not conſtantly in the ſame quantity, and proportion.</p>
            <p n="11">11. LASTLY, the Cryſtals of the Walton Water, and, the white powder into which theſe dried Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals ſall, when diſſolved, the Solution is again per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and clear in an exceedingly ſmall quantity of Water.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1270300500:9"/>
            <p>SALT of Tartar, added to this Solution, becomes Milky, and a copious white ſediment ſubſides, ſound to be Magneſia.</p>
            <p>LIME Water added to the Solution, occaſions a Milky whiteneſs, and a ſoft Alkaline precipitation, but it does not happen near ſo ſoon as that made by falt of Tarter.</p>

            <head>SOME FARTHER EXPERIMENTS On WALTON WATER, Made in NOVEMBER, 1787, By JOHN JOHNSTONE, <hi>B. A.</hi> Of MERTON COLLEGE, OXFORD.</head>
            <p>THE Water, on which the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were tried, had been drawn from the Spring ſeveral weeks before it was uſed. And though it was conveyed from Walton to Birmingham in Bottle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> well corked and covered with Wax, yet the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances which reſult from the preſence of the Volatile Ingredients are not to be expected in theſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS Water did not immediately become Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Tincture of Galls, but by ſtanding it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a duſky greeniſh colour with a variegate Pellicle at the top.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1270300500:10"/>
            <p n="2">2. PHLOGISTICATED Alkali did not occaſion any change of the colour in the Water.</p>
            <p>THE fixed Air having eſcaped, the Iron was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated, and of courſe could not exhibit thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances which it did in the Experiments made by my Father at the Spring.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SYRUP of Violets made it of a light green Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Tincture of Turnſole became brown when mixed with it. Tincture of Brazil Wood gave it a blue caſt.</p>
            <p>THE Appearances produced by theſe three Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were occaſioned either by Magneſia or Alkali, diſengaged by the eſcape of the fixed Air.</p>
            <p n="4">4. ACID of Sugar diſcovered Lime, by precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in the form of a white Powder.</p>
            <p n="5">5. SALITED Terra Ponderoſa, by attracting the Vitriolic Acid, occaſioned a white turbidneſs in this Water.</p>
            <p n="6">6. NITRATED Silver ſhewed the preſence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Acid; its attraction for it producing a white Cloud, which on ſtanding, became of a black colour.</p>
            <p n="7">7. AN Alkali, very copiouſly precipitated a white Powder, which appeared to be Magneſia.</p>
            <p>BY ſeveral Experiments, a quart of the Walton Water yielded, on Evaporation, 120½ grains.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE reſidue of a Quart of this Water, was firſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1270300500:11"/>mixed with Alcohol, which took up 6 ½ grains of it. This, by its deliqueſcing in the air, was found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of Magneſia.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Diſtilled Water diſſolved 105 grains of it. As I could not cryſtalliſe the whole, I cannot tell the proportion of each Salt, but I had reaſon, both from what did cryſtalliſe, and from Experiment, to ſuppoſe, that Vitriolated Magneſia is the moſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in this Water. A quantity of Alcohol, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to precipitate the Baſes of thoſe Salts in which there was Vitriolic Acid, was mixed with a pint of Walton Water. A copious Precipitation enſued, which on examination proved to be Magneſia alone. For on adding Syrup of Violets to the Magneſia in diſtilled Water, no evidence of Alkali appeared more than what Magneſia would alone have given.</p>
            <p>To a quart of Walton Water was added a quantity of Vegetable Alkali ſufficient to precipitate all the Magneſia. When the Precipitation was over, the whole was ſiltered, and the Water ſet to cryſtalliſe. The Cryſtals in general, were thoſe of Vitriolated Tartar, and a few reſembling thoſe of Glauber's Salts appeared. A very ſmall quantity remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſtalliſed, which perhaps, was common Salt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. DISTILLED Vinegar was mixed with what the Water left, and took up 5 ½ grains of it. On Examination this proved to be Lime. It had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable pungent taſte, did not deliqueſce in the Air, and formed on the Addition of Vitriolic Acid, a kind of Gypſum.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1270300500:12"/>
            <p n="4">IV. AN Alkali diminiſhed the remainder 1 ½ grain. I could not exactly tell what the Alkali took up here, but it ſeemed to be a kind of Argillaccous Earth.</p>
            <p n="5">V. THE Alkali left nearly 1 ½ grain of a black looking Earth. This was mixed with diluted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Acid, which diſſolved nearly the whole of it. Phlogiſticated Alkali, dropped into the Solution, immediately produced a very bright blue Colour. I therefore concluded that the grain and very ſmall quantity more which the Marine Acid had diſſolved was Iron. The ſmall quantity of Earth which did not diſſolve in the Acid, as it reſiſted all the above mixtures, I concluded to be Siliceous Earth.</p>

            <p>A QUART of Cheltenham Water yielded, on Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, 127 grains.

         <div type="experiment">
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1270300500:13"/>
            <head>EXPERIMENT 1.</head>
            <p>SHEWS Walton Water abounds with fixed Air. Lime becomes quick, calcined or cauſtic, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of this Air by fire; and being attracted again from this Water, the Calcareous Matter before held in Solution, becomes mild and precipitates in form of a clear and white powder. The immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, which takes place by the mixture of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Water with Lime Water, and ſtill more clearly the Air forced from Walton Water agitated with Lime Water, is therefore a certain teſt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of fixed Air in Walton Water.</p>
            <p n="2">2. BY this experiment, Iron in a ſmall quantity, appears to be one of the ſugitive ingredients in the Walton Water. This, as well as ſome abſorbent earth, is kept in a diſſolved ſtate by the fixed Air and the Sulphureous Gas contained in it: When the fixed Air flies off, which it does much ſooner than the Hepatic Gas, the Iron precipitates, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is no longer capable of becoming Purple by aſtringents. The action of heat carries off the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patic Gas, which appears to hold the abſorbent earths in Solution, which are left by evaporation; and to which the ſoft, almoſt oleaginous taſte, with which this Water ſtrikes the tongue, is probably owing.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1270300500:14"/>
            <p n="3">3. THE addition of Saccharum Saturni diſcovers the preſence of the Hepatic Air, another fugitive principle contained in this Water, as well as that of Cheltenham: But it is much leſs fugitive than fixed Air, being often perceived, both in the Cheltenham and Walton Waters, after they have been bottled a conſiderable time. This Sulphureous or Hepatic Air, found in this and in other Waters, has been the occaſion of much controverſy among the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have analyſed Waters: Mr. Kirwan, has, probably finally, ſettled the diſpute, by ſhewing that Hepatic Air is no other, than actual Sulphur kept in Solution, in an acrial State, by union with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of heat, Ph. Tr.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT is evident, from this article, that the fixed Air only diſſolves and keeps Iron ſuſpended in the Water. Its diſappearance ſo ſoon, ſhews its very volatile Nature, and, the neceſſity of reſorting to theſe Springs, to have the benefit of a principle and ingredient, which gives penetrability, and action to the Saline contents of the Waters.</p>
            <p n="5">5, 6. SHEW the Salts contained in theſe Waters are neutral: And, that neither the acid nor the Alkali, of which they are compounded, prevail.</p>
            <p n="7">7-11. DEMONSTRATE, that Vitriolated magneſia, is the principal Salt contained in the Walton Water. The attraction of an alkaline Salt, and eſpecially that of the cauſtic Alkali, with the Vitriolic Acid, is greater than that of the Magneſia, which is precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in theſe experiments.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1270300500:15"/>
            <p n="8">8. THE exiſtence of Sea Salt, is manifeſted by this experiment, and by the cubic Cryſtals formed in the reſiduum.</p>
            <p n="9">9, 10. FROM all our experiments, fixed Air diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſmall quantity of Iron: Hepatic Air, united with an abſorbent earth, appear to be the fugitive ingredients of the Walton Water. The fixed ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients diſcovered by evaporation and cryſtalliſation, appear to be a Vitriolated Magneſia, united with a little Vitriolated Mineral Alkali, in the quantity of ſix or ſeven drachms, in one Gallon of Water. Magneſia, Lime and abſorbent earth, and a delique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent bitter Lixivium, conſiſting of ſalited Magneſia and Lime, with a few grains of entire Sea Salt, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, about a drachm or two to a Gallon.</p>
            <p>THAT theſe alſo are the component Medicinal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in the Cheltenham Water, appears by the analyſis, of the learned Dr. Fothergill, of Bath.</p>
            <p>THIS Gentleman, in his very valuable experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enquiry into the nature and qualities of Chelten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Water, p. 42. concludes, "from the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experiments, a Gallon of the Water, wine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, appears to contain the ſubſequent principles, nearly in the following proportions: Native Glauber Salt, with a portion of Epſom Salt, one ounce; Sea Salt, five grains; Iron combined with fixed Air, five grains; Magneſia combined with fixed Air, twenty five grains; Calcareous earth, or Selenite, forty grains; fixed Air, combined with phlogiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1270300500:16"/>Air, twenty-four ounce meaſures. To theſe may, perhaps, be added a ſmall proportion of Hepatic Gas or Hepar Sulphuris converted into Vapour by the ſeparation of its phlogiſton."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">This uſeful Work has been much improved and enlarged in the Second Edition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BY this ingenious Work, it appears, and is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known to all who frequent Cheltenham, that the Iron is very ſoon precipitated from the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after it is drawn from the Pump; and, in a ſhort time it cannot be made to aſſume a purple colour, by the addition of aſtringents.</p>
            <p>THE Salts of the Walton and Cheltenham Waters, are both ſoluble in a very ſmall quantity of Water, equal to their weight nearly: And their impreſſion on the human ſenſes, and, their action in the bowels, is the ſame.</p>
            <p>IN ſo many points, the Cheltenham and Walton Mineral Waters, are entirely like each other; a pint or leſs of each opens the body; ſome find a ſmall addition of the Walton, neceſſary to produce the ſame effect in the ſame degree; others find no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; the purgative Salt is ſomewhat leſs, about a drachm in a gallon, in my experiments; but the quantity of fixed Air, and Steel are at leaſt equal. The Hepatic Air ſeems to prevail in the Walton Water, over the Cheltenham, which gives it a moſt pleaſing almoſt Oleaginous ſoftneſs, and makes it highly grateful in taſte, and gentle in operation, and,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1270300500:17"/>far more ſuitable in diſeaſes of the kidneys, and uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary paſſages, than the Cheltenham Water itſelf.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT, therefore entering into a farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of Chymical reſearch, I apprehend the ſimilarity of the Walton, to the Cheltenham Water, to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently aſcertained, to warrant its uſe and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the diſeaſes, for which Cheltenham Waters have been uſed with advantage.</p>
            <p>THE analyſis of Mineral Waters, undoubtedly is highly uſeful; but notwithſtanding the perfection to which it is carried by diſcoveries in modern Chymiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I apprehend it gives a very imperfect idea of the real compoſition of Waters; in ſhort, ſuch an idea as diffection gives of an animated body, a view of its parts disjointed, and ſeparate, very different from that union, on which ſymmetry and life depend.</p>
            <p>IT is on this account, that the exhibition of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients found to compoſe mineral Waters, and the imitations of many of them, adminiſtred as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, fall ſhort of the Waters prepared by Nature, eſpecially when drank at the ſources.</p>
            <p>IT is the ſame in other parts of the Materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica: An analyſis, in ſome meaſure, aſſiſts in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for the operation of a Medicine, but ſeldom enables us to prepare, and compound to perfection, the natural productions we pretend to imitate.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Theſe Sentiments have been diſtinguiſhed by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of M. MARCARD, his Majeſty's Phyſician at Hanover, in his learned Account of the Waters at Pyrmout.</note>

            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1270300500:18"/>
            <p>THE uſe, and advantage of Waters, is eſtabliſhed by experience alone, as well as that of every article in the Materia Medica. The advantages found from the uſe of the Walton Well, in various eruptive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and in old ſordid ulcers, as well as in many other diſeaſes, has already been ſo conſiderable as to confirm the expectation grounded on their being ſimilar to the Cheltenham Water.</p>
            <p>IT will undoubtedly be found as much like Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham Water, as that Water is like itſelf at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeaſons. Seaſons occaſion accidental differences of ſaturation in all Mineral Waters, the cauſe of which, is ſometimes known, and ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. Rainy ſeaſons, while they make Springs more abundant, render the Mineral impregnation at the ſame time weaker. To this alteration, the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Water muſt be ſometimes liable, as it lies on a plain, part of which is frequently overflowed with Water. But, if by experience, this ſhall be ſound to have any conſiderable influence, means will be uſed to remove the inconvenience. An inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which is very ſeldom likely to happen in dry and warm ſeaſons, in which, Waters of this claſs, are for the moſt part reſorted to.</p>
            <p>AFTER all, I am perſuaded, that the dilution of Mineral Waters is very ſeldom any injury to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. The virtues and powers of Mineral Water, depending principally on the quantity of Water, the medium, in which the Medicinal ingredients are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1270300500:19"/>ſuſpended; the vehicle which conveys them into the ſmalleſt veſſels, and makes them capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving obſtructions fixed in them, and in various glands; hence the ſame Medicinal ingredients, given in the uſual forms, have but little efficacy in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>THE healing powers of the Walton Well, and thoſe of its Siſter of Cheltenham, are owing to the mixture of a neutral compound of vitriolated Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia, commonly called Epſom. or Cathartic Salt; to vitriolated Mineral Alkali, or Glauber Salt, with a ſmall portion of ſalited Mineral Alkali, Magneſia, and Lime, nearly to the quantity of a drachm, in a pint of Water; alſo to a conſiderable quantity of fixed Air, and Hepatic Gas, by the former of which Iron, and by the latter Magneſia, and abſorbent Earth, are held in Solution.</p>
            <p>THE whole is a compoſition, friendly to appetite and digeſtion; as well as ſoft, and pleaſing to the taſte. It is alſo a penetrating deobſtruent, and, atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating medicine, and in ſenſible operation, a quick and gentle Laxative and Diuretic; and when applied with diſcretion, it may be continued a long time without any dimunition of ſtrength.</p>
            <p>IT is obvious, this Water contains Saline ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and, others poſſeſſing different attractive powers and aſſinities, which, though ballanced in the Water; yet, when mixed with animal fluids, and Salts in the courſe of digeſtion, Chyliſication,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1270300500:20"/>and in circulation with the blood, muſt be ſo chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and varied as to form new attractions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations in their courſe through the veſſels, whence compounds poſſeſſing properties, different from what exiſted before, will be produced, and the ſyſtem it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will be changed. It is well known, that cold is generated by diſſolving Salts; and, that while Saline Bodies, of different affinities, and attractive powers, are forming new compounds; ſuch Salts in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of mutual attraction, and incorporation, produce heat. In this manner, and from ſuch cauſes, new ſtimuli, with other alterations, take place in the glands, and remoter veſſels of our ſyſtem, from the Salts, combined with other ingredients in Mineral Waters; and, it is by theſe means, as well as eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, they become beneficial, and are really valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alterative Medicines.</p>
            <p>THE Walton Waters, being a compound, <hi>ſui ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veris,</hi> ſimilar to Cheltenham, they both operate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, and principally on the inteſtines, as a gentle purgative, <q>"Their mode of operation, (ſays Dr. Smith, p. 21, 22,) upon the inteſtines, producing an eaſy, ſudden diſcharge, is explainable upon the principle of the tenuity, and uniform diffuſion of the ingredients in the Water. For the Water, after having performed its ſtrengthening, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilarating office upon the ſtomach, paſſes quickly into the inteſtines as ſluids do, carrying along with it, more or leſs of all its ingredients, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly its great dilution, and conſequent diſperſion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1270300500:21"/>all over the internal ſurface of the canal, vellicates the innumerable, little exhalent veſſels, with which that cavity is crouded, into a plentiful ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and notwithſtanding the ſtimulus may be but ſlight on any particular part, on account of the minuteneſs of the particles of the Salt; yet as they are univerſally diffuſed, and act upon the whole ſyſtem of exhalents at once, a more eopious and expeditious evacuation is produced, than what is often attainable from a much larger quantity of any of the other more ſtimulating purgatives leſs atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated; attended at the ſame time with theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant advantages; that as the ſtimulus is gentle, no griping pain is likely to be excited, and as it is ſuperficial, the particles muſt ſoon be waſhed off in the general current, without leaving behind them any of thoſe diſagreeable feelings that uſually hang in the rear of other Cathartics."</q>
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">See Obſervations on the uſe and abuſe of Cheltenham Waters, by J. SMITH, M. D. Savilian Profeſſor of Geometry, Oxford.</note>
            </p>
            <p>COROLLARY. Mineral Waters in general, derive their healing powers much leſs from the metals, earths and ſalts, often inconſiderable in quantity, which remain after evaporation, than, from the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile principles, united with them, but diluted in a very great proportion of Water; and, they univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally owe the activity the whole poſſeſſes, to the incorporation of the volatile and ſugitive principles, both with the Water, and, with the groſſer ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, combined together moſt intimately.</p>

            <p>THE taſte of the Walton Water, freſh from the Spring, as has been already obſerved, is at firſt ſoft, and afterwards agreeably Saline; the Sulphur and Iron, are alſo plainly taſted in it, in the quantity of a pint, and, often leſs, it occaſions two or three lax ſtools, and, operates without the leaſt ſickneſs, gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or any kind of inconvenience.</p>
            <p>THE quantity of urine is alſo encreaſed: it ſits eaſy on the ſtomach, and appetite is promoted.</p>
            <p>THE volatile principles fly off, ſoon after the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is removed from the Well; and, as theſe are ſo eſſential to its efficacy, and, render it agreeable to the taſte and ſtomach, and carry the Saline, invigora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and deobſtruent contents of the Water into the veſſels and glands; it is neceſſary to drink it from the Pump, or very ſoon afterwards.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1270300500:23"/>are expelled. In this manner the ſeeds of diſeaſe will be prevented in the chyliferous veſſels; and the Chyle itſelf being highly elaborated, and, withal, diluted with the Water, enters the lacteals, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch qualities and powers, as bid fair to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and remove obſtructions which have taken place in the channels of the chyle and lymph.</p>
            <p>HENCE, obſtructions in the meſentery and glands will gradually be reſolved, as this Water will be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to dilute and diſſolve any tenacious matter, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of moving in the chyliferous veſſels, on account of its glutinous, cheeſe-like, and, ſteatomatous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and, will ſtimulate the veſſels, and, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteric glands, by its Saline contents, ſo as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to puſh on any obſtructing matter.</p>
            <p>SOME portion of the Waters, being abſorbed, will act as a powerful deobſtruent in obſtructions of the liver.</p>
            <p>BY thinning the Hepatic bile, and, carrying that fluid regularly into the inteſtines. By preventing the ſtagnation of bile in the gall-bladder. By gently ſtimulating the biliary veſſels, and encreaſing their action. In a word, by the united inſluence of theſe powers, recent obſtructions, or older ſcirrhoſities, which have taken place either at home, or by reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in warm climates, will be remodied.</p>
            <p>CALCULOUS concretions in the biliary ducts, and, in the gall-bladder, when of a ſize capable of being

In like manner, new concretions of the biliary kind, will be effectually prevented.</p>
            <p>So that this Water will be found a very effectual remedy for jaundice ariſing from gall-ſtones, as well as from other cauſes, obſtructing the diſcharge of the bile into the inteſtines. It will alſo be found uſeful in removing obſtructions in the ſubſtance of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and, in preventing hemmorrhoidal, and other diſcharges of blood, which moſt frequently originate from obſtructions in the Liver.</p>
            <p>HEMMORRHOIDAL ſwellings, and diſcharges of blood from other cauſes, obſtructing, or retarding its motion, and, return through the branches of the vena portarum, will be eaſed or relieved by a ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable uſe of this Water.</p>
            <p>THE ſoftneſs, which is peculiar to this Water, renders it proper in diſeaſes of the urinary paſſages; as it acts powerfully on the Kidneys, and occaſions an encreaſed ſecretion there, as well as in the inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tube; gravelly concretions will be prevented or waſhed away. As the ſecretion of urine is in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, ſound eſſential, for carrying out of the body, the Salts and Oils, which are prejudicial to health; purity of blood will be very greatly promoted by the encreaſe of this ſecretion; ſo that by the free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1270300500:25"/>from this emunctory, along with that from the alimentary canal, the ſkin will be cleanſed from hot red eruptions, and, from ſcaly, and ſcabby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruſtations, which notoriouſly ariſe from a blood, and habit overloaded with acrid, and impure matter; when by exceſs in diet, or by improper food, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect digeſtion, or inadequate ſecretion and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch acrid corrupt matter is formed, and retained in our bodies. Gentle evacuation, by the uſe of ſuch Waters, is generally a certain relief under theſe circumſtances; this has been experienced by various perſons, but very remarkably by one TANNER from <hi>Kidderminſter,</hi> who has had a leprous eruption removed from his face, and other parts, by drinking the Walton Water, and, applying it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally; which relief, for ſix years paſt, he had not obtained by any means whatever.</p>
            <p>THE preſerving the bile in a fluid ſtate, and, the regular conveyance of it into the duodenum, will powerfully operate in compleating the digeſtion, and Chylification of the food; and, will give the blood thoſe properties, which ſupport the health, and, vigour of the body.—With that, all cutaneous ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will diſappear, and, the bloom of beauty re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume its charms, along with the eaſe, and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inſeparable from wholeſome ſluids, and, from good health.</p>
            <p>BY removing the ſomes, which cauſes Scurvies, Scrophulous, Herpetic eruptions, Leproſies, and,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1270300500:26"/>every kind of cutaneous ſoulneſs, whether of the red, and pimply, or the ſcaly, and, ulcerous kinds; I ſay, by gradually draining off this fomes, and, ſoliciting its exit from the emunctories, ſuch foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the ſkin, accompanied with itchings, ſores, and, even ſcirrhous, and, cancerous taints, will often be prevented, removed or palliated.</p>
            <p>CHRONIC weakneſs, and, dejection of ſpirits, ariſing frequently from the ſame latent ſources, will receive relief from the ſalutary, though ſlow opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Waters.</p>
            <p>OBSTRUCTIONS in the uterine ſyſtem, ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the menſtrual diſcharge, and, other irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, and, exceſſes peculiar to it; the fluor albus, ſcirrhous tumours, and other diſeaſes of the womb, will in many circumſtances and conſtitutions, find a uſeful remedy in the Walton Water.</p>
            <p>OBSTRUCTIONS left by the long continuance, and, the frequent return of intermittent fevers, will, probably, yield to a prudent uſe of theſe Waters; and, they will prepare the patient, and, put him in a fit ſtate to receive further benefit from the Bark.</p>
            <p>OBSTRUCTIONS in the Lungs, from a ſcorbutic cauſe, and, acrid humours in the blood, and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate ophthalmia's, have been relieved, and, are likely to be ſucceſsfully treated by the Walton Water.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not give many directions concerning the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1270300500:27"/>uſe of this Water, profeſſedly ſimilar to that of Cheltenham, the method of drinking, of which, has been long aſcertained by eſtabliſhed uſage, and, the public is poſſeſſed of the directions of eminent, and, able practitioners explanatory of their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, in this point.</p>
            <p>THE Summer Months are the ſeaſon to drink the Walton Waters; as they will, in theſe months, and, in dry weather be in their moſt perfect ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation.</p>
            <p>LIKE Cheltenham, the Walton Waters are their own preparative; three quarters of a pint, drank at the Pump, may be taken in the morning, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, this quantity may be encreaſed to three half-pints afterwards, if the former quantity does not ſufficiently open the body.</p>
            <p>BUT I would obſerve, that the middle doſes, ſuch as merely preſerve the body in a lax ſtate, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding three ſtools daily, are preferable to larger doſes, and to greater evacuation; the buſineſs and intention, being to carry off the ill-digeſted remains of meals, perhaps of exceſs, and of luxury, and, of all kinds of corrupt recrementitious matter lodged in the alimentary canal, without impairing ſtrength and digeſtion.</p>
            <p>EARLY hours are neceſſary to an advantageous uſe of the Waters at the Well, where only they are drank without the loſs of the active Volatile ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1270300500:28"/>which give power to thoſe that are more fixed, to penetrate into the glands, and ſmalleſt veſſels.</p>
            <p>EXERCISE ſub dio, is alſo equally proper to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the operation of the Water, and to ſtrengthen the body.</p>
            <p>AN eaſy digeſted nutrient diet, conſiſting, when it agrees with the ſtomach, of milk in the morning and at night, of light meats and vegetables at dinner, with general temperance, and moderation in the uſe of vinous liquors, rather than total abſtinence from them, is highly expedient.</p>
            <p>IN a ſituation, where excellent fiſh is ſo plentiful, it is proper to obſerve, that moderation in this article will be prudent, as a very frequent uſe of fiſh is found often prejudicial in diſcaſes of the ſkin, and, ſometimes produces the more obſtinate diſeaſes of that claſs; diſeaſes, for which theſe Waters are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly proper.</p>
            <p>IT is almoſt ſuperfluous to add, that, however uſeful it may be to entertain the mind with pleaſing ſociety, and, an agreeable ſucceſſion of amuſements, it is always neceſſary to retire to reſt at an early hour, and, before eleven o'clock at fartheſt to be in bed, that the conſtitution may have the advantage of nature's ſweet reſtorer, balmy ſleep.</p>
            <p>IN the cutaneous diſeaſes, and, many of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the glands, for which the internal uſe of theſe Waters is proper; Baths of different degrees of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1270300500:29"/>heat from that of common cold Water, to that of one hundred degrees of Fahrenheit's ſcale, will be highly expedient; this will appear in a ſtronger light, from what I ſhall offer concerning the ſunctions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the lymphatic glands. I apprehend, the diſeaſes of theſe glands, are chiefly to be reached by the means of remedies, which are applied, ſo as to be abſorbed by the lymphatic veſſels, which paſs to the glands. I am confident, that the moſt obſtinate cutaneous, and glandular diſeaſes would yield to a due perſeverance in the external and internal uſe of Waters and other proper remedies. But what theſe remedies are, and, alſo the uſe, whether external or internal of Mineral Waters, and of Medicines of all kinds, which are to produce any important and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conſequence, can only be determined in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes, and conſtitutions, by the judgment of an able, and experienced phyſician.</p>

            <p>THE uſe of Mineral Waters in diſeaſes of the glands, leads me to offer ſome thoughts, which, I believe, are either new, or have not been enough attended to, concerning the uſe, and diſeaſes of the lymphatic glands.</p>
            <p>THE lymphatic ſyſtem, which makes an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant article in the anatomical diſcoveries of the laſt century, has received much improvement in this. It is not my buſineſs to aſſign to each improver or diſcoverer, his due proportion of merit. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my obligations to them all. To Haller, Meckel, Monro, Mr. Hewſon, Dr. William Hunter, and Mr. John Hunter, Mr. Sheldon, and Mr. Cruik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhank; who have all contributed, and, ſome of them very ſplendidly, to perfect the knowledge of this important part of the animal ſyſtem; and, let them not deem it amiſs, that profiting by their labours, I endeavour to make them ſubſervient to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the animal oeconomy, and to the healing art.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1270300500:32"/>
            <p>THAT the lymphatic veſſels ariſe from every viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, and, from every cavity in the body, as well as from the ſkin, and the cellular membrane inveſting the body, in prodigious, and till lately, in undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered numbers, is an anatomical truth of the greateſt importance, now clearly demonſtrated, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged.</p>
            <p>THE lymphatic veſſels, and lacteals are of the ſame kind, and, conſtitute a ſyſtem of veſſels, no where connected with the veins, containing red blood; but, which univerſally terminate in the lacteal ſac and duct, and convey chyle, and lymph collected in every part into the ſubclaviam vein, where it mixes with the blood, and no where elſe.</p>
            <p>THE, ſole and excluſive function of this ſyſtem of veſſels is abſorption.</p>
            <p>SOME, indeed, have held, that the red veins are ſupplementary abſorbents, eſpecially on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and the illuſtrious Walther and others, with ſome probability, have aſſigned this office to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na portarum, eſpecially in diſeaſes, in which the conglobate glands of the meſentery are ſcirrhous, or obliterated by age, as ſome have ſuppoſed, or, the lacteal ſac, and duct itſelf is obſtructed. The proofs of this are equivocal, and accounted for on different principles, by the ſchool of Hunter, particularly, by that accurate anatomiſt, Mr. John Hunter, who firſt diſcovered that abſorption is carried on by the lymphatic veſſels alone.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1270300500:33"/>
            <p>THE lacteal, and lymphatic veſſels univerſally paſs through conglobate glands, before the fluid they convey, reaches the lacteal duct; thoſe ariſing from the inteſtines, enter the different orders of meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teric glands, and, the chyle and lymph depoſited in theſe glands, is again abſorbed from them by the vaſa lymphatica efferentia, in order to be conveyed to the thoracic duct.<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Cruikſhank paſſim. p. 76.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS law is univerſal, and, the lymphatic veins wherever they ariſe, in no inſtance enter into the lacteal duct, without previouſly, and repeatedly throwing the lymph into the conglobate glands, which are an eſſential part of this ſyſtem, a part of the greateſt importance, for the advantage of which, the lymph is abſorbed, in order to be conveyed to them; and from them the lymph is taken up in a more purified, and aſſimilated ſtate, and is conveyed by the lymphatica efferentia into the lacteal ſac and duct.</p>
            <p>THE ſtructure of theſe glands is both vaſcular and cellular; into theſe cells the lymph is thrown, and the abſorbing lymphatics, the lymphatica efferentia, are the only excretories, to all the conglobate glands; the uſes of which are acknowledged to be unknown and undiſcovered, by gentlemen to whom anatomiſts are ſo much indebted, Meſſrs.

            <p>YET it is a matter not only intereſting in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of phyſiology, to aſcertain their uſe, but is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary to enable us to underſtand more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the diſeaſes of the glands, and, to treat them with ſucceſs: we will therefore purſue the enquiry.</p>
            <p>A FLUID is conſtantly exhaled into the cavities containing the viſcera; this fluid is liable to be altered, either by remora or mixture; the abſorption of this fluid is the function of the internal lymphatics, and, when it is prevented, either by obſtruction of the conglobate glands, or, by any other cauſe; Dropſies in the brain, thorax, pericardium, abdomen, and the widely diffuſed cellular membrane, ariſe.</p>
            <p>THE lymph along with the chyle, and nutritious liquors prepared from the food in the inteſtinal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1270300500:35"/>canal, is abſorbed by the lacteal and lymphatic veſſels, for they are the ſame; theſe fluids are immediately thrown into the meſenteric glands; and, they are more numerous there than in other parts, becauſe their office is peculiarly important, that of perfecting the chyle or nutritious fluid, extracted by digeſtion from food. That fluid is perfected by intercepting what is noxious in the cells of the conglobate glands, where it undergoes a digeſtion before it is abſorbed by the ſecond and third orders of the lacteal veſſels.</p>
            <p>NUMEROUS lymphatic veſſels, ariſe alſo from the ſtomach, inteſtines, and from the glandular viſcera; from the pelvis, the bladder, and parts of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in males and females; they obſerve the ſame law, and paſs through the iliac conglobate glands, or others before they enter the lacteal ſac; and, their uſe is the ſame, to intercept crude, nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, unaſſimilated matter, which has been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unfit by diſeaſe, or other means to mix imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and unaltered, with the blood.</p>
            <p>THE food we take in, and the air we breathe, while they convey the neceſſary ſupports of life, contain alſo the feeds of diſeaſe and death.</p>
            <p>THE lymphatic veſſels, which ariſe in the mouth, and, from the trachea and lungs, (where their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is immenſe), convey the fluids they abſorb, with whatever extraneous matter has been taken up to the numerous conglobate glands of the neck, to the thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roid gland, thymus, and the glands of the lungs,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1270300500:36"/>where it is digeſted before it reaches the thoracic duct.</p>
            <p>IN young animals who take in their food by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which action much is abſorbed by the lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatics; the glands are very large, numerous and conſpicuous, the more perfectly to digeſt, and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe the crude fluids received by ſuction, with the milk.</p>
            <p>WHEN that period of life is paſſed over, the thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roid glands and thymus are not quite ſo neceſſary, and abate in ſize, but are never totally obliterated.</p>
            <p>IN pointing out the buſineſs of purifying, and animaliſing lymph, as the function, of the conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate glands in general, I believe I have diſcovered the uſe of the thymus in infants, and, of the thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roid glands, hitherto one of the hidden myſteries in anatomy.<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Cruikſhank, ſpeaking of the Thymus, ſays, "I know not the uſe of this gland;" and of the Thyroid gland, "as I have not the leaſt conception of its uſe, I do not underſtand what functions in particular its abſorbents perform," p. 183.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE external ſurface of the body, is no leſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorptive, fluids are imbibed, thirſt abated, urine and weight encreaſed from thence. Garlick, externally applied is ſoon ſmelled in the breath. Turpentine gives the urine a violet ſmell. Variolous matter, and the venereal poiſon introduced by the ſmalleſt puncture, produce ſimilar diſeaſes, and, previous to univerſal infection and diffuſion, the inguinal and axillary glands, are ſwelled and inflamed by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the poiſon into them. Mercury, the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1270300500:37"/>to this poiſon, alſo enters freely by the ſkin. Bliſters applied to the arms and ſhoulders inflame the axillary glands; thoſe of the neck in children, particularly are made hard and ſore by ulcers behind the ears, and in the head, and, by bliſters to thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>ULCERS and punctures in the legs, and other parts, often occaſion ſwellings along the lymphatics up to, the axillae, or inguinal glands. Purulent bubos ariſe frequently from ſuch ulcers, and, from matter formed in the joints. The axillary glands are ſwelled by ſtagnating milk, by cancerous ſwellings, and inflammations in the breaſt. Cancers in the lips and on the face, cauſe ſimilar ſwellings under the lower jaw, and, in the neck. The ſame glands are ſwelled by gum boils, and by venereal ſores in the lips. Acrid matter abſorbed, inflames the lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic veſſel, and, the gland, univerſally, between the ſeat of the matter and ſore, and, the thoracic duct; and, its entrance into the body, may be prevented by cauſtic, or, by the exciſion of the part. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſcattered over the ſurface of the body are abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, thus calomel is known to enter; and, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a degree of ſalivation, and ſore mouth, produced by a ſmall quantity of corroſive ſublimate, rubbed with crude ſal armoniac and camphire ſcattered on bed linen, in order to prevent a morbus pediculoſus.</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider theſe various facts, that all lymphatic veſſels perpetually enter the conglobate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1270300500:38"/>glands, and, in the cells, of which theſe glands uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally conſiſt, depoſite the lymph, which being abſorbed once, and, again by larger lymphatics, is at length conveyed by the great channel, the lacteal duct, into the vena cava deſcendens, under the left calavicle. When we recollect, that the Venereal Virus, Cancerous and Variolous poiſons, enter the body by theſe channels, and, and are primarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in theſe glands, occaſioning there tumours, ſometimes indolent, ſometimes painful, inflamed and ſuppurating. It ſeems clear, theſe glands are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by nature, to purify the lymph, before it enters the blood veſſels, from matter, which may be noxious there, by arreſting it in the glands, univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with abſorbents.</p>
            <p>IN theſe glands, it is either altered by a concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and digeſting power inherent in them, or when it is too noxious to be ſubdued into a ſalutary nature it remains in the form of a tumour, or eſcapes by ſuppuration. When it cannot be ſubdued, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by ſuppuration, and, thoſe ſalutary efforts of nature fail, it is then abſorbed, and, diffuſes diſeaſe in the conſtitution at large.</p>
            <p>THUS the glands in the neck, and the thyroid are interpoſed to intercept crude matter, or noxious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus taken up from the noſtrils, mouth, trachea and lungs, and other parts about the neck and breaſt, more eſpecially in very young animals.</p>
            <p>THE meſenteric glands purify, and digeſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1270300500:39"/>is abſorbed with the lymph and chyle from the inteſtines.</p>
            <p>THE axillary, and inguinal glands, alter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept whatever extraneous matter may happen to be abſorbed from the ſurface of the body, or the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lular membrane.</p>
            <p>THE glands have the power of aſſimilating into a ſound fluid, ſuch noxious matter, in very many inſtances. But when it is highly virulent as in the lues, in ſcrophulous, and in cancerous diſeaſes, that digeſting and aſſimilating function is overpowered, the gland remains ſcirrhous, or, is deſtroyed by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, and, the matter enters, and contaminates the habit.</p>
            <p>IN fine, the uſe of theſe glands is to intercept as ſponges, and to alter as digeſtive organs, whatever is unfit to enter into the maſs of blood. In ordinary caſes, this is effected without obſtruction, or, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and, then no apparent conſequences detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to health appear, and, the depoſited matter is abſorbed again, and, goes along with the ſound lymph. In extraordinary caſes, the poiſon remains in the gland, and, deſtroys its powers firſt, and its ſubſtance, and organization afterwards.</p>
            <p>THE fatal conſequences, which have followed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of undigeſted alimentary fluids, directly into the red veins of living animals, are proofs that the lymphatic glands have the uſe and function here
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1270300500:40"/>alledged, and, ſhow, that without the <hi>lymphatic digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> liquors apparently harmleſs, are unfit to mix with the blood; and, produce fatal effects there.<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Haller, Elem. Phyſ. Tom. 1. p. 228.</note>
            </p>
            <p>HOW the glands alter, digeſt, and aſſimilate the matter abſorbed, and depoſited in them, I know not, and ſhall not attempt to explain; I think that power implanted in them, as well as in the ſtomach and inteſtines; and, we ſee an important apparatus, ſet apart for the purpoſe, by Him! whoſe ability is too great, in every inſtance to be fully comprehended, and interpreted by us his creatures.</p>
            <p>FROM the uſes here aſcribed to the lymphatic glands we ſee, why they are moſt numerous, where abſorption is greateſt; and, particularly in thoſe parts, where crude matter is abſorbed. We ſee, why the glands are nearly as numerous in the neck as in the meſentery<note n="(h)" place="bottom">P. 130.</note>; for beſide the matter abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from the inſide of the mouth, noſtrils, and trachea; the abſorbents from the brain join the glands of the neck. Though theſe have not been traced by anatomiſts; as a copious exhalation, and, abſorption conſtantly take place in the ventricles of that organ; as we have reaſon to believe, the Water in the internal hydrocephalus is ſometimes abſorbed; from the general law, we may preſume, that lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatics exiſt in the brain, though not certainly traced there<note n="(i)" place="bottom">P. 127, Cruikſhank.</note>; this is confirmed by the internal
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1270300500:41"/>cephalus often happening in ſcrophulous and ricketty children, in whom the glands of the neck are ſcirr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hous.</p>
            <p>IT is well known, that ſwellings of the glands of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten follow cruptive diſeaſes. They ariſe after ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let fever, meaſles and ſmall pox. Dropſy, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the conſequence of them all. And I have known the hydrocephalus internus, as well as other Dropſies ſucceed the ſcarlet fever; another preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proof, that abſorption in the brain, is carried on by lymphatic veſſels, as well as in other parts.</p>
            <p>WE alſo, ſee why the glands are more numerous in the meſentery, through which all the chyle paſſes and are ſmaller, and leſs numerous in the meſocolon, through which hardly any chyle paſſes, whence Mr. Cruikſhank is led to ſay, "this looks as if the glands were intended to produce ſome remarkable change in the chyle"<note n="(k)" place="bottom">P. 127.—of Cruikſhank.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE meſenteric glands, as well as the conglobate glands in other parts, being cellular, as well as vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, contain a white milky fluid, moſt conſpicuous and abundant in young animals.

            <p>THE lymphatic veſſels being deſtitute of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving impulſe of the heart, and having no other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of motion to carry on the liquors abſorbed, but that of the irritability of the lymphatic ſyſtem, the motion of the lymph is neceſſarily liable to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. Hence obſtructions happen more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the conglobate and lymphatic glands, than in the conglomerate glands. The liver may be excepted, becauſe the blood conveyed into it by the vena portarum, undergoes a ſimilar retardation in that very ſingular vein.</p>
            <p>THE conglobate glands, are hence univerſally lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſcirrhoſity and obſtruction. The meſenteric glands are notoriouſly liable to great enlargement and hardneſs, and thereby often cauſe a ſlow conſuming ſever and atrophy in infants. Similar ſwellings in the meſenteric glands are ſometimes obſerved from ulcerated inteſtines after dyſentery. The neck is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtrumous without accompanying obſtructions in the meſenteric glands.</p>
            <p>THE thyroid axillary and mammary glands, as well as the iliac lumbar and inguinal glands are all frequently ſound obſtructed and ſcirrhous. In a word theſe glands are not only obſtructed in venereal and cancerous habits; but the ſcrophula and rachitis likewiſe originate in them, and are principally ſeated in the glands.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1270300500:43"/>
            <p>IN all caſes of obſtructed glands, the chyle and lymph, being imperfectly aſſimilated, the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes gradually vitiated, and, unfit for nouriſhment. Hence that acrimony often called ſcorbutic; an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous and even cancerous diſpoſition of fluids origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. From the ſame ſource the bones become brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, break in ſome, and are rendered ſoft and flexible in others.</p>
            <p>ALL theſe facts conſpire to ſhew the importance of the digeſtive, and aſſimilating power of the glands, and, lymphatic ſyſtem, in perfecting the animal fluids.</p>
            <p>IN diſeaſed glands, the chyle is not ſufficiently aſſimilated, and, that defect gradually induces acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and impurity in the lymph, which ſoon taints the blood and habit univerſally.</p>
            <p>IT is more from this defect, than from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the chyle into the blood, being prevented by obſtruction, that maraſmus, and conſumption follow ſcirrhoſities in the meſentric glands.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"IT is poſſible,"</q> ſays, the ingenious Cruikſhank, <q>"that children, and, even grown perſons, may have died of the tabes meſenterica from obſtructions in the glands, rendering them impervious to the chyle."</q> But he never ſaw any ſuch ſtagnation of chyle, as theſe are ſuppoſed to cauſe, on any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whatever.<note n="(l)" place="bottom">P. 107, Cruikſhank.</note>

            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1270300500:44"/>
            <p>THE lymph, and chyle, enter the blood but in a corrupted, crude, unanimaliſed ſtate.</p>
            <p>I AM confirmed in this opinion, by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of another excellent Anatomiſt, Mr. Sheldon, which I ſhall quote from his ſplendid Hiſtory of the Human Lacteal Veſſels.</p>
            <p>IN ſubjects, in which the lymphatic glands of the meſentery, were found entirely obſtructed, ſometimes by a curd-like ſubſtance, ſometimes by calcareous earth, Mr. Sheldon, could puſh injections of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver from the veſſels, below the obſtructed glands, to thoſe above them, though not a ſingle particle of quickſilver, could be made to enter the glands in this obſtructed ſtate. In this caſe, the collateral branches of the lacteal veſſels, which communicated with thoſe above, were enlarged, and, had conveyed the chyle into the lacteal duct.</p>
            <p>THE ingenious Dr. Cheſton, found the cavity of the lacteal duct totally obſtructed for a conſiderable length, by an earthy matter, in a man who had a Spina Ventoſa of the os ilium.</p>
            <p>IT is probable, the chyle, in this caſe, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from below, into the lacteal duct, above the obſtruction, by one or more collateral anaſtomoſing branches, which are every where numerous in the lymphatic veſſels, and, frequent in the lacteal duct itſelf. This being a proviſion of nature, for ſecuring more certainly, a regular conveyance of the chyle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the blood veſſels.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1270300500:45"/>
            <p>I remember a melancholy caſe, which ſhews the thoracic duct, ſometimes is obſtructed in a fatal degree; a young lady, high in rank, beautiful in perſon, and amiable in diſpoſition; had a ſwelling in the neck, which extended itſelf under the left cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicle, and there obſtructed the entrance of the tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racic duct into the ſubclavian vein ſo completely, as to render her incurably dropſical in every part of her body.</p>
            <p>WHAT I have now offered, concerning the uſe of the glands, belonging to the lymphatic ſyſtem, will, I apprehend, derive ſupport from the late diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and will be found uſeful in the treatment of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the glands.</p>
            <p>MEDICINES taken into the ſtomach, and mixed with the chyle, are, indeed, in the direct channel, to reach the diſeaſed glands of the meſentery.</p>
            <p>BUT this is not the caſe, reſpecting the conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate glands in other parts. Medicines mixing with the blood never directly reach theſe glands. and, but very remotely, and indirectly affect them; and, this is one of the reaſons why, diſeaſes in theſe glands, have always appeared ſo ſtubborn, and have ſo rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded to the common treatment, and internal uſe of Medicine.</p>
            <p>THE confiding alone to Medicines, conveyed by the lacteals into the channel of circulation; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention to the only entrance into the external diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1270300500:46"/>glands, that by abſorption, are I am perſuaded, cauſes why thoſe diſeaſes have proved ſo obſtinate, and rebellious to Medical treatment.</p>
            <p>IT is the cauſe why ſcrophula, and ſcirhous glands, have become cancerous, and finally incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and fatal.</p>
            <p>IT is evident then, that the remedies proper for removing obſtructions ſhould be applied to ſuch parts, from whence the lymphatics ariſe which may abſorb and conduct them to the glands, the obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of which are to be removed.</p>
            <p>APPLICATIONS intended to remove glandular ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the neck, the thyroid gland, the bronchocele &amp;c. muſt be made to the head, neck, cheeks, and mouth internally, as well as externally.</p>
            <p>VAPOURS inhaled by inſpiration, are proper in the diſeaſed glands of the lungs.</p>
            <p>REMEDIES intended to paſs into the axillary glands, muſt be applied to the arms and breaſt.</p>
            <p>IN diſeaſes of the inguinal glands the remedies intended to paſs into them, and through them, muſt be applied to the genitals, and to the legs and thighs.</p>
            <p>THE advantages found from the local application of Mercury in Venereal ſwellings of the inguinal, and axillary glands, and in ulcers of the throat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplify this doctrine in that diſeaſe.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1270300500:47"/>
            <p>THE holding Medicines intended to remove the the bronchocele, and ſwelled neck, in the mouth and under the tongue, is eſſential to give efficacy to theſe Medicines, as has been long experienced, in the Coventry Medicine. The ſaline ingredients, whether alcaline, or neutral, of which ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines uſually conſiſt, are abſorbed by the lymphatic veſſels ariſing in the inſide of the mouth, and, are conveyed directly to the diſeaſed glands with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant good effect.</p>
            <p>INTERNAL obſtructions in the meſentery in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, are to be relieved by internal Medicines; and in every kind of glandular obſtruction Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been found highly neceſſary and uſeful.</p>
            <p>THE Chalybeate, the ſulphureous, the ſaline, the hot, and the cold Waters, have all been tried with advantage.</p>
            <p>OF laxative Medicines, the purgative Mineral Waters, always operate with the leaſt diminution of ſtrength, and with the leaſt diſturbance; the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is for the moſt part mended under their uſe, and important alterations in the whole ſyſtem, ariſe from continuing to apply to them. Their operation principally affects the firſt paſſages in clearing away what is recrimentitious, and hurtful in that ſeat and ſource of corruption.</p>
            <p>THEY next directly operate on the lacteal veſſels and glands; they dilute the chyle, and ſtimulate the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1270300500:48"/>lacteals themſelves, which are ſufficiently irritable; and remove thereby, both the ſource of obſtruction, and the obſtructions, which may have taken place, in the conglobate glands of the meſentery.</p>
            <p>IN this manner they contribute to the purity, and perfection of the chyle and lymph, and remove all obſtacles, to its perfect digeſtion in the inteſtinal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and in the lacteal veſſels and glands.</p>
            <p>HENCE this ſource of tainted fluids being taken away from the chyle and blood, and no new acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious depoſition falling on the remoter parts of the body; the lymphatic veſſels and glands, there reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their functions, and, abſorb and digeſt, what was before lodged on the ſkin, and on the adjacent parts of the ſurface of the body.</p>
            <p>THUS, under the uſe of ſuch Waters, continued for a ſufficient length of time, depoſitions, eruptions and defedations of the ſkin, with ulcers and glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſwellings diſappear. It is thus the Harrowgate, Cheltenham and Walton Waters prove beneficial.</p>
            <p>THE Sea Water, acts not only as a powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal remedy in the ſame diſeaſes; but has its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy greatly promoted by bathing; waſhing thereby away much cutaneous foulneſs, and removing more by being directly abſorbed into the lymphatic's, and conveyed to the diſeaſed glands; at the ſame time, that a uſeful ſpring and vigour is given to the whole conſtitution.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1270300500:49"/>
            <p>I MIGHT illuſtrate the practical importance of theſe principles by caſes, but this letter being already too long, I now commit it to your conſideration. To you! who joining reading to experience and talents, make the healing art your ſtudy and delight.</p>
