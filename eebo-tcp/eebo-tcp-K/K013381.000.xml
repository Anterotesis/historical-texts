            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS little Treatiſe was at firſt not intended to be publiſhed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, but only to be annexed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work of the author's, printed at the ſame time, entitled, <hi>Obſervations on Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific Medicines,</hi> &amp;c. But as many may have an occaſion to peruſe this part without the other, who would not care to be at the expence of purchaſing both together, a few copies were printed off ſeparate for this reaſon.</p>
            <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0425900900:4"/>
            <p>All the merit which the author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to in this, as well as in the other Treatiſe, is, his having offered to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind the means for relief, eſtabliſhed upon reiterated experience, (the moſt infallible foundation for the ſcience of phyſic) which will ſcarce ever fail of giving ſatisfaction to the miſerable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; eſpecially if the rules and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preſcribed, and given with the medicines herein recommended, are ſtrictly adhered to.</p>
            <p>In long protracted and obſtinate caſes, which will not eaſily yield to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral method of cure, herein mentioned, the author deſires to be conſulted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perſon or by letter. He requeſts thoſe who <hi>ſend</hi> their caſes, to be very particular with reſpect to the ſymptoms of their indiſpoſition, length of time they have been afflicted, what means
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0425900900:5"/>they have already uſed, and likewiſe their age, preſent degree of ſtrength, conſtitution, habit of body, &amp;c. and all letters, (poſt-paid) directed to him, to be left at Mr <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s and Co. book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, at the <hi>Oxford-Theatre,</hi> on the <hi>North-Side</hi> of <hi>St. Paul's Church Yard,</hi> ſhall have due attention paid them, and be anſwered with all the ſpeed that the diſtance of place will admit of.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ASTUPRATIO,</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſtupratio;</hi> Manual Stupration, or Self-Pollution, is a vice hardly to be named, much leſs to be practiſed in a country, where virtue, decency, or politeneſs, have the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0425900900:7"/>paid to them; and this abominable and unmanly practice is productive of the moſt deplorable, and generally incurable diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>Providence has implanted in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what is by ſome called, <hi>the Paſſion of Love,</hi> and by others, <hi>the Appetite of Luſt,</hi> for very wiſe purpoſes; but has given us reaſon to reſtrain this neceſſary inclination, and keep it within due limits. Every day, however, furniſhes us with caſes which evince, that reaſon is not always a ballance againſt the appetites; for boys regardleſs, or perhaps ignorant of the conſequences, too frequently indulge themſelves in this prepoſterous method of venery; and it is beyond a doubt, that many, more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years, who are long immured in colleges and cloiſters, and at laſt elope from their cells, utterly deſtitute of ſcience, and equally unacquainted with the world and books, are not leſs guilty of this enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vice.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0425900900:8"/>
            <p>Theſe by a moſt deteſtable kind of magic, conjure up at pleaſure an ideal <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and thus never want an opportunity of enjoying an imaginary miſtreſs. The frequent repetition of theſe execrable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures induce an infinitude of the worſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; ſuch as Lethargies, Vertigo's, Atrophys, Apoplexies, Palſies, Lowneſs of Spirits, Hypochondriacal Diſorders, Amauroſes, a Tabes Dorſalis, and the worſt ſpecies of a Gonorrhaea, moſt commonly attended with an utter impotence as to real enjoyments; beſides an innumerable train of various nervous complaints, ſuch as are the frequent attendants upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining age, when the vigour of youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to wear off.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſorders chiefly derive their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from thoſe univerſal convulſions, that always attend the emiſſion of the <hi>Semen;</hi> and if we conſider the human body, as made up of flexible pipes, and yielding fluids, we ſhall readily underſtand how Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0425900900:9"/>wear out the conſtitution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe effects, viz. by deſtroying the ſtrength and elaſticity of the ſolid parts. And that the extacy which accompanies venereal enjoyments is of the nature of a convulſion, is not hard to be conceived. <hi>Quincy,</hi> in his explanation of <hi>Sanctorius</hi>'s Aphoriſms expreſſly ſays, that <q>"At the time of coition, the fibres are intenſely drawn up; that too frequent uſe of this exerciſe, cannot but be very prejudicial to health by overſtraining and deſtroying the force of the fibres"<note n="*" place="bottom">Sect iv.

Hence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is leſſened,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mala a nimio Coitu orta mediate a Perſpiratione. Sanctor. Sect. vi. Aphoriſm iii.</note> the fluids run into preternatural coheſions, and obſtructions are generated. And this morbid condition is ſtill augmented by an exceſſive loſs of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0425900900:10"/>
               <hi>Semen</hi> itſelf, ſince the blood is thereby robbed of its moſt pure, balſamic, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorating particles.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is worthy of remark, that people who are accuſtomed to ſuch filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are not ſo eaſily cured of any chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical diſtemper as thoſe who are free from it; for as <hi>Celſus,</hi> ſpeaking about venereal intercourſes, prudently remarks, <hi>Caven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumne in ſecunda valetudine adverſae preſidia conſumantur:</hi> that is, <q>"We ſhould take care of conſuming wantonly in a ſtate of health, what would be our ſupport during ſickneſs."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Semen verile,</hi> is a fluid of the moſt elaborate and noble production in the whole body, except that of the nerves, if ſuch there be; and it is this vital feed which makes men hot, robuſt, hairy, of a ſtrong and deep voice, bold and courageous, and fit to contrive, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0425900900:11"/>any enterprize. Men are a proof of this; whereas they who are deſtitute of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Seed, are wrinkled, pale, weak, of a ſhrill voice, without hair, beardleſs and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate; ſuch are eunuchs. For we know from experience, when the ſecretory or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of this juice are deſtroyed by caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration before the time of puberty, as is frequently done in <hi>Italy</hi> to preſerve the voice; or if by any accident a man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his teſticles after this age, the deſtruction of theſe marks of verility alſo follow, in confirmation of this <hi>Boerhaave</hi> has given us an inſtance of fact. <q>"There was, ſays he, an intrepid ſoldier, who, aſpiring after the reward propoſed by the general, to him who would firſt fix the ſtandard in the enemies fort, climbed through the thick battery of the enemy, but unfortunately the fire of a cannon took off both his teſticles; yet he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and became at length effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, not in mind but in body. The ſtrength of the ſeveral muſcles of the genital parts ſtill continued, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0425900900:12"/>towards his virility but his teſticles, and yet his voice ſoon altered, and beard fell off, &amp;c."</q> But the man who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive of the ſeminal juices, becomes bold, hardy and ſtrong, like the beaſts of the foreſt; witneſs the <hi>Athletae</hi> of old, who led chaſte lives.</p>
            <p>Therefore as the <hi>Semen</hi> is, as it were, the flower and choiceſt part of the blood and nervous fluid, ſo venery ought to be only moderately uſed; leſt too great an evacuation of this ſubſtance prove preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to health. A frequent ejection of the <hi>Semen</hi> requires a ſound and vigorous habit of body, becauſe it exhauſts the ſtrength, and weakens the perſon; hence <hi>Pythagoras</hi> when aſked, when coition was to be uſed, wiſely anſwered, <q>"When you have an inclination to render your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf weaker."</q>
            </p>
            <p>As venery then only agrees with perſons of robuſt and vigorous conſtitutions, ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0425900900:13"/>the uſe of it is principally beneficial to health, after the ſtomach is empty, and perſpiration duly performed, eſpecially if the perſon has ſlept well, and taken ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a nutritive quality, and eaſy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. All theſe things are of ſuch a nature, as to increaſe the ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the body, and conſequently to favour venery, or at leaſt prevent the bad effects it would otherwiſe have. It is alſo to be obſerved, that it is more ſalutary in Spring than at any other ſeaſon of the year.</p>
            <p>The perſon who would often engage in venery, ought to guard againſt all ſurfeits, hunger, labours, exceſſive ſtudies, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections, watchings, purges, and every thing which can in the leaſt impair and deſtroy the ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Celſus</hi> obſerves,</p>
            <q>
               <p>"That we ought not too eagerly to purſue, or too ſollicitouſly to avoid, intercourſes with the tender ſex.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0425900900:14"/> Pleaſures of this kind, rarely indulged, render the body alert and active, but if too frequently repeated, weak, languid, and inactive. And as the proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of theſe pleaſures is not to be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the number of repetitions, but by the conſtitution, the age, and the ſtrength of the perſon; ſo we may take it for granted, with reſpect to this particular, that the enjoyment which is neither followed by weakneſs, nor ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by pain, is not prejudicial.</p>
               <p>The day is the worſt ſeaſon for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this kind, eſpecially if they are ſucceeded by a full meal; the night is leſs hazardous, but even then ſubſequent fatigue, with long watching, render it improper. It is alſo to be abſtained from in ſummer, becauſe at that time, it is ſubject to throw the humours into preternatural commotions."</p>
            </q>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0425900900:15"/>
            <p>But as moderation in every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to health, ſo likewiſe does tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate venery, and every one ought carefully to conſider what his conſtitution can bear. For a very robuſt perſon may ſafely indulge himſelf in a degree of venery, which would remarkably weaken one of a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>Perſons of a tender and delicate habit of body, and weak <hi>Craſis</hi> of blood and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſhould by no means indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in venereal engagements, without great moderation and caution; thoſe who are either too young, or too old, and thoſe who are lately recovered from a diſeaſe, ought alſo to abſtain from venery, leſt they bring on too great a relaxation of the nerves, and by overſtraining the fibres that compoſe all the parts of their bodies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure and weaken their ſeveral functions in the animal ſyſtem, and become liable to all thoſe diſorders that have been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

            <p>Thus they, who by nature were ſtronger than others, have, by intemperance, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themſelves much weaker than thoſe who were naturally weak; and thoſe who were much weaker by nature, have, by their temperance, become ſuperior in ſtrength, to thoſe who were ſtronger; for nothing renders an animal robuſt, but the ſeminal juice, which is therefore of great efficacy and importance towards health, ſtrength and magnanimity, as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
            <p>But as there are too many, who do not attend to the rules here laid down, ſo much as would be convenient for them, perhaps the following caſe may be of ſome importance, to ſuch as have not yet utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed their conſtitutions, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate purſuit after pleaſures.</p>
            <q>
               <p>"A young man of twenty-five years of age, of a phlegmatico-ſanguine habit, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0425900900:17"/>who from his very infancy, had a tender conſtitution, when about fifteen years of age, learnt of a wicked ſchool-fellow, the execrable trick of <hi>Maſtupration.</hi> He indulged himſelf in this vile and unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice, very frequently, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt daily, from the fifteenth to the twenty-third year of his age, and applied himſelf at the ſame time to writing in a very ſmall character; by which means he contracted ſuch an exceſſive weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his head and eyes, that theſe latter were frequently convulſed, during his prepoſterous entertainment.</p>
               <p>Some time ago, while he was wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly employed in this manner, and his deſign upon the very point of being executed, ſome perſon or other unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly knocked at his chamber door, which accident put him into ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that the ultimate ſcene of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion was left unaccompliſhed. Upon this he immediately felt ſo exquiſite a pain, and ſo vehement a tenſion in his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0425900900:18"/>teſticles, and ſpermatic veſſels, that he could not walk without the utmoſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. The force of his genius, and the ſight of his eyes, ſeemed at the ſame time to be diminiſhed and impaired.</p>
               <p>Though he had the danger, with which this execrable practice threataned him, in full view, yet after the pain of his teſticles was removed, he was ſo much infatuated as to repeat his crime, and begin afreſh his former courſe; but he was ſoon after ſeized with the like pain in his genitals, and eſpecially in his teſticles, where the pain was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a very conſiderable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. By the uſe of external and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal medicines for about half a year, he alſo got this diſorder removed, but with ſome difficulty.</p>
               <p>Soon after he was ſeized with a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in thoſe veſſels, which go to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0425900900:19"/>left teſticle. The ſwelling appeared larger than ordinary after his meals, but was not accompanied with pain, unleſs, when by his folly he brought a ſtimulus on the parts; but though it was void of pain, it was attended with another very unlucky circumſtance, for it remains with him to this very day. To this was joined ſo great a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his head and eyes, that when he was about to read any thing, he ſeemed to be drunk, and fluſhed with wine; the pupils of his eyes were extremely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and his eyes themſelves racked with darting pains, accompanied with ſome degree of tenſion; his eye-lids ſeemed, as it were, oppreſſed with a kind of weight; in the morning they were conglutinated together, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered very much; but this was not all, for both corners of his eyes, beſides the violent pains with which they were racked, were alſo clogged and ſtuffed with a whitiſh kind of matter.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0425900900:20"/>
               <p>In this deplorable ſtate he was obliged to give over reading, and interrupt the courſe of his ſtudies, for the ſpace of ſix months, during which time he only employed himſelf in exerciſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, and in taking the medicines, which were judged proper for one in his condition; by which means he recovered ſo far, as to be able to apply himſelf to his ſtudies for two or three hours a day, which he can ſtill do; but if at any time he ſhould chance to protract his application, and lengthen out his ſtudies beyond their ſtated time, he is immediately ſeized with the above ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; beſides, he was become ſo lean that his body was little more than a ſkeleton; and though his appetite was good, yet he was indiſpoſed after his meals, and was affected with a kind of drunkenneſs.</p>
               <p>But when he got a juſter ſenſe of things, and had for almoſt the ſpace of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0425900900:21"/>two years abſtained from his former practices, and from all commerce with women, he began to be troubled with very frequent nocturnal pollutions, by which he found his body gradually more and more weakened, and his ſtrength impaired; ſo that now what ſeemed principally to be regarded was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of this imbecility, which was after ſome time entirely cured, by the uſe of my STRENGTHENING ELECTUARY, of which more will be ſaid hereafter."</p>
            </q>
            <p>From this account, we learn, that Venery uſed either too ſoon or too often, not only impairs the ſtrength of the body in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but alſo debilitates the noble functions of the brain and eyes, to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that the loſs becomes almoſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable.</p>
            <p>I have had an opportunity of ſeeing a great many caſes, where perſons well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0425900900:22"/>in years, have by immoderate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, not only brought upon their eyes redneſs, darting pains, accompanied with tenſion, a heavy ſenſation, as if a weight was laid upon them, and a frequent ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of tears, but likewiſe ſuch a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſight, that they were rendered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable either to read or write; and I have found that in theſe very caſes, the pupils were always dilated, as they are in a <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi> by reaſon of the weakened, or loſt tone of the muſcular and nervous ſibres which ſurround them. But why need I ſtop here? ſince I myſelf knew two caſes, in which a <hi>Gutta Serena</hi> itſelf was brought on by exceſſive venery, and a long ſeries of grief.</p>
            <p>Hence it appears how great and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing a conſent there is between the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal parts, or rather the ſpirituous ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal fluid itſelf, and the fabric of the eye, which is compoſed of the fineſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0425900900:23"/>nerves and muſcular fibres, as well as the moſt clear and tranſparent fluids.</p>
            <p>The lymphatic ſeminal fluid is almoſt of the ſame nature and quality with that fluid which is ſecreted in the brain, and diſtributed through all the nerves of the body; for which reaſon, the more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the evacuation of the former is, the more ſcanty and defective the ſecretion of the other in the brain muſt of courſe be. Hence alſo a reaſon may be aſſigned why thoſe youths, who begin too early to taſte the forbidden joys of <hi>Venus,</hi> ſuſtain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſs of memory, and are render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unfit for ſtudy; and likewiſe why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons farther advanced in years, who are exceſſively addicted to venereal pleaſure, loſe their ſtrength, and bring on a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature death.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0425900900:24"/>
            <p>The reaſon of the nocturnal pollutions in the caſe juſt recited, is very plain; for the more copious and frequent the afflux of the humours, eſpecially of the ſeminal matter, has been to the organs deſtined for generation, either by the force of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination or otherwiſe; I ſay the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and copious ſuch an afflux has been, the more the ſpermatic veſſels are dilated and relaxed, and the ſeminal juice for that very reaſon, flows into them in a greater quantity, and lays a foundation for thoſe wanton ideas, and ſeminal excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which even during ſleep affect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a warm imagination.</p>
            <p>But the moſt formidable ſpecies of this diſeaſe, is when the retaining veſſels are ſo extremely relaxed, as to permit the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal juices to paſs off upon the ſlighteſt ſtimulus, as a luſcious idea, or converſation with a woman, after ſtraining at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the excrements, or after riding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0425900900:25"/>on horſeback in conſequence of a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the night time the ſame accident happens from venereal dreams, with a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of enjoyment; and this is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended with a continual weeping, or gleet, which exhauſts the ſtrength of the patient.</p>
            <p>The matter of this flux is an humid, thin, cold, colourleſs ſubſtance, called by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> a <hi>Liquid Semen</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Burnet. Hippocrat.</hi> Contract. p. 114.</note> which is void of foecundity: for how is it poſſible that nature thus refrigerated, ſhould emit a prolific juice? Thoſe afflicted with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order muſt of neceſſity become old in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of body, ſlow, languid, dull, ſpiritleſs, ſilent, feeble, wrinkled, unactive, pale, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate, of a weak appetite, cold, with a heavineſs of the limbs, and a numbneſs of the legs, weak, lazy, and indiſpoſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0425900900:26"/>for all manner of action; in many ſubjects this diſorder is the forerunner of a Palſy; but it oftener terminates in that ſpecies of a Conſumption, called by phyſicians <hi>Tabes Dorſalis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Tabes Dorſalis</hi> is a violent diſorder, little treated of by phyſicians, though ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed by <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Tabes Dorſalis ex ſpinali medulla oritur, praecipue vero recentes ſponſos &amp; libidinoſos corripit, febris ſunt expertes, bene comedunt, &amp; colliquantur.

The ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which preſage this Conſumption, I have for the moſt part obſerved to be theſe, an hypochondriacal oppreſſion, melancholy,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0425900900:27"/>and too much thoughtfulneſs, pain in the back, and often in the head, an aching pain, rolling and hanging down of the teſticles, a weakneſs of memory and ſight, and a decay of ſtrenght; there is a ſenſe of weight and giddineſs of the head, and a ringing in the ears, and as the diſorder proceeds, all the ſymptoms are increaſed, the legs ſwell, as in dropical caſes; in ſome, Ulcers ariſe on the loins, ſome of which are healed, whilſt others riſe in their ſtead. At laſt, a violent Cataract ariſing, the patient is rendered totally blind; theſe are followed by ſome others; as a thirſt, an hectical diſpoſition, an Atrophy, a waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fleſh, &amp;c. &amp;c. till at laſt the body is brought to the higheſt degree of a Conſumption; and that very often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cough, or any other remarkable ſign of a Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the moſt common diſorders that enſue from the exceſſive uſe of <hi>Venery,</hi> and the prepoſterous practice of <hi>Self-Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> for the cure of which I have two
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0425900900:28"/>medicines which I ſhall recommend; the firſt, which anſwers the firſt intention of cure, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtopping of the Gonorrhaea, is my STRENGTHENING ELECTUARY, which braces up and ſtrengthens the weakened and relaxed ſolids, warms and invigorates the habit, promotes digeſtion, and thereby furniſhes the diſpirited and impoveriſhed blood, with laudable and benign chyle.</p>
            <p>The other medicine is my RESTORATIVE NERVOUS ELIXIR, which is perhaps the moſt ſtimulating <hi>Reſtorative</hi> that medicine can produce, and in the laſt decays of life, will ſtill ſupply the vital lamp with ſome recruits; it is good in all Languors, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Decays of the conſtitution, for it ſtrengthens all parts of the body, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſtomach, when relaxed and diſordered with frequent debauches, and by reſtoring the oſcillation of the fibres, quickens the various motions, and gives freſh vigor to the animal functions. It is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0425900900:29"/>an admirable remedy for thoſe who have been in a manner wore out with venereal engagements, eſpecially if their pleaſures have been purchaſed at the expence of a few ſalivations, or a frequent uſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial medicines, and it will revive any conſtitution that it not quite mouldered into rottenneſs. But they beſt deſerve ſuch a <hi>Reſtorative,</hi> who by acute diſeaſes, ſuch as malignant Fevers, the Small-Pox, and the like, have been ſo broke and ſhattered in their conſtitutions, as hardly to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a poſſibility of recovery. For in ſuch it will to admiration repair the impoveriſhed juices, and fill again the veins with a warm, generous, nutritive blood.</p>
            <p>It is excellent in diſeaſes of the head, ariſing from a conſent with the ſtomach, ſuch as the Vertigo, Head-ach, Sleepy Diſeaſes, dread of an Apoplexy, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the memory and ſight, and a noiſe or ringing in the ears. In Scrophulous
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0425900900:30"/>habits alſo, which are leaning towards Conſumptions, it will be of the utmoſt ſervice. And when young perſons are not ſo early happy in their conjugal embraces as many wiſh to be, and it be ſuſpected from a coldneſs, and inſufficiency upon that account on either ſide, the uſe of this medicine cannot fail to render their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe prolific, as it actually romoves the cauſes of impotency in one ſex, and of ſterility, or barrenneſs, in the other. But the uſe of it is varily to be indulged, leſt with it be kindled a heat that reaſonable coition cannot aſſuage. And let ſuch as indulge themſelves too laviſhly in theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, be careful how they ſpur nature, and prompt with ſuch helps, leſt they run off their life and ſtrength too precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately, for the beſt conſtitutions in the world, wear out and ſink under the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetition of ſuch profuſion, as the frequent ſtraining any elaſtic body what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, will weaken more and more it's ſpring, till it is quite loſt, notwithſtanding all the helps of art to preſerve it.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0425900900:31"/>
            <p>To conclude. The omnipotent Creator has given us <hi>Paſſions</hi> for very wiſe and good ends; which ſeem to be, that thereby we may be urged with a kind of impetuoſity to ſhun evil, and embrace good; wherefore the paſſions are not bad in themſelves, it is by their exceſs that they become vicious, when they riſe to ſo extravagant a pitch, as not to be governed by the dictates of reaſon. But we ought to uſe our beſt endeavours to keep them within proper bounds, and the more difficult the conflict, the more glorious will be the victory.</p>
            <p>We have all a natural propenſity to pleaſures; but theſe are of two very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſorts, the ſenſual and the mental. Senſual pleaſures engroſs the greateſt part of mankind, while theſe few only, <hi>quos equus amavit Jupiter,</hi> are taken with the beauties of the mental. And the reaſon why ſo many run after pleaſures of the firſt ſort, ſeems to be, becauſe they hardly ever allow themſelves an opportunity of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0425900900:32"/>taſting the ſweets of an upright conſcience, or of feeling that joy, which ariſes to a good man, from the moderation of his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular deſires; and being entirely devoted to the gratification of their ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, they never give attention to the real charms of virtue. Wherefore whoſoever deſires to enjoy this ſolid happineſs, ought to enure himſelf by degrees to the love of virtue, and ever carefully to avoid adding fuel to the fire of his paſſions.</p>
            <p>Appoſite to theſe ſentiments is that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which <hi>Cicero</hi> puts into the mouth of <hi>Cato,</hi> as by him received from the great <hi>Archytas</hi> of <hi>Terentum; that nature never afflicted mankind with a more capital plague, than bodily pleaſure; the eager deſires of which ſpur on to enjoyment with ungovernable raſhneſs.</hi>

            <p>And the reſt of what that great philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher has written on this ſubject, muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the mind of every wiſe man in the peruſal. Wherefore, <hi>Virtue</hi>'s exclamation in <hi>Silius Italicus,</hi> is very juſt:
<q>
                  <l>Quippe nec ira Deum tantum, nec tela, nec hoſtes,</l>
                  <l>Quantum ſola noces, animis illapſa voluptas<note n="*" place="bottom">Punicorum. Lib. <hi>xv.</hi> Ver. <hi>94.</hi>

                  <l>More miſchiefs haſt thou wrought than hoſtile arms,</l>
                  <l>Than wrath of Gods.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But as the due government of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtrengthens the mind, ſo temperance in diet renders the body leſs expoſed to theſe turbulent motions. And this rule holds good, not only in thoſe, who are naturally of a hot conſtitution, but even in thoſe who curb their appetites; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it keeps them in a ſtate of tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And this is the way in general to reſiſt theſe evils, or at leaſt to diminiſh their effects.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0425900900:34"/>
            <p>As for thoſe who would have us to be entirely devoid of paſſions, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all the affections of the mind, as if they were ſo many evils; they certainly have a wrong notion of the wiſdom, and goodneſs of the Almighty Creator, who has inſerted, and, as it were, interwoven them into our frame for excellent purpoſes; for they are not only beneficial to indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals upon many occaſions, but even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for keeping up ſociety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions between mankind.</p>
