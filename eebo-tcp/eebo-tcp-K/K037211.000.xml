            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

At preſent, both my perſon and knighthood are in jeopardy; my Lord-chief-juſtice, to whoſe care I am commended, holding me not altogether in good liking. But no matter—if I am to be provided for, what avails it who is my caterer?

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0314300500:31"/>
And doſt thou think me ſo unpractis'd a courtier as to return the perquiſites of my calling, becauſe I am turn'd out; or to reſtore the purchaſe of my good-will, becauſe I am not likely to get in. What take ye me for a younker? a geck? Go to—you cannot play upon me.—Maſter Shallow, reſt you content: your money is in good hands; and, if I do not ſpend it like a gentleman, never truſt me with a thouſand pound again.</p>

                     <p>Good day to you, maſter doctor apothecary. And yet I know not whether I ought to wiſh that neither; for a good day to him muſt be a bad one to ſome-body.

I would not loſe him, methinks; for, tho' he be a worthleſs knave, he is an old acquaintance; and I never could find in my heart to part with my old acquaintance merely becauſe they were good for nothing. King Hal is another ſort of a man to what I am, to abandon his old friends in his proſperity thus. Poor Peto!</p>

                     <p>And do you think, Bridget, Sir John will be at laſt as good as his word, then? How ſits my ruff to-day? I would thou hadſt bought me one of thoſe new-faſhioned farthingales.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Brid.</speaker>
                     <p>O, madam, you are mighty fine, as it is, truly: and, I am ſure, Sir John can do nothing leſs than admire you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Urſ.</speaker>
                     <p>Thinkeſt thou ſo, Bridget? Why, to be certain, a peach-colour'd ſattin does become my complexion hugely. But I think the roſes are faded in my cheeks. Well, no matter: he might have gather'd them twenty years ago, had not he been a rover. I hope, however, he has ſold his wild oats now, and that I ſhall yet have the ſatisfaction to be called my lady Falſtaff.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Brid.</speaker>
                     <p>To be ſure, madam; and tho' Sir John is but a knight at preſent, he will be very aſſuredly, now the young king is crown'd, be made a great lord, and may be a duke. Indeed, madam, I cannot think of leſs.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Urſ.</speaker>

                     <p>Ay, madam, that will be a day to ſee; if I am ſo happy as to be in your grace's favour.</p>

                     <p>For certain, Bridget, thou ſhalt. Well, this love is a ſtrange thing! there is Sir John has deceived me a thouſand times, and yet, I know not how, he always perſuaded me he was ſincere.</p>

                     <p>And yet to be ſure, before I receiv'd his letter, I thought I never ſhould hear from him again, and had almoſt come to a reſolution to caſt him entirely off.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Urſ.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed, but I am—old enough to know I ought not to part with one lover till I am ſure of another.</p>

                     <p>To be ſure, madam, a bird in the hand is worth two in the buſh; but the ſport of hampering the rogues, who are at liberty, is ſo vaſtly pretty.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>Ay, if we were ſure of catching them at laſt; but Bridger, Bridget, how often do they eſcape through our ſingers and give us the ſlip! Beſides, it is for younger laſſes than I to go bird-catching—I cannot throw ſalt on the tail of a ſparrow now.</p>

A monk; and to mortify the fleſh! For heav'ns ſake, good father, conſider what a mortification indeed that muſt be to me, who have fix times the quantity of any other man. If I muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the pale of the church, why not make a canon of me (not indeed a minor canon) but a prebendary, or a biſhop, now. Something might be ſaid for either of theſe. But for a monk! I know not any thing I am leſs fit for; unleſs indeed his lordſhip had meant to make a running footman of me.</p>

                     <p>O, if I ever find myſelf that way inclin'd; his lordſhip may depend on it I ſhall be as ready as ever to follow my inclinations. But the leſſon of lean and ſallow abſtinence is very long and hard, good father; I am not gotten half-way through the firſt chapter yet.</p>

                     <p>Some ſteps, however, Sir John, you muſt take, toward a more reputable way of life; and that ſpeedily too: otherwiſe you will be ſtript of the honours of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and the king's ſentence of baniſhment will be ſtrictly put into execution againſt you.</p>

                     <p>As to the matter of knighthood; once a knight and always a knight, you know. The king may make as many knights as he pleaſes; but he will not ſo eaſily unmake them again.
