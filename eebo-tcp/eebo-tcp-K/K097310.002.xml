            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <head>Analogies between Animals and Vegetables.</head>
               <p>AMONG the numberleſs objects with which
the ſurface of this globe is covered and
peopled, animals deſervedly hold the firſt rank,
both on account of the relation they ſtand in to
man, and of their acknowledged ſuperiority over
vegetable and inanimated matter. The ſenſes,
the figure, and the motions of animals, beſtow
on them a more extenſive connection with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
objects than is poſſeſſed by vegetables.
The latter, however, from their expanſion, their
growth, and the variety of parts which compoſe
them, are more intimately related to external
objects than minerals or ſtones, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
inert, and deprived of every vital or active
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0195400702:5"/>
principle. It is this number of relations alone
which renders the animal ſuperior to the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and the vegetable to the mineral. Man,
if we eſtimate him by his material part alone, is
ſuperior to the brute creation only from the
number of peculiar relations he enjoys by means
of his hand and of his tongue; and, though all
the operations of the Omnipotent are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
equally perfect, the animated being, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our mode of perception, is the moſt
compleat; and man is the moſt finiſhed and
perfect animal.</p>
               <p>What a variety of ſprings, of powers, and of
mechanical movements, are included in that
ſmall portion of matter of which the body of an
animal is compoſed! What a number of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
what harmony, what correſpondence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the different parts! How many combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
arrangements, cauſes, effects, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
all conſpiring to accompliſh the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign!
Of theſe, we know nothing but by their
reſults, which are ſo difficult to comprehend, that
they only ceaſe to be miraculous from our habits
of inattention and our want of reflection.</p>
               <p>But, however admirable this work may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
the greateſt miracle is not exhibited in the
individual. It is in the ſucceſſive renovation,
and in the continued duration of the ſpecies,
that Nature aſſumes an aſpect altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
and aſtoniſhing. This faculty of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction<note n="*" place="bottom">This word is frequently uſed by the author, and requires to be explained. It ſignifies the power of producing or propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating in general, and is equally applicable to plants and to animals. Generation is a ſpecies of reproduction peculiar to animated beings.</note>,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0195400702:6"/>
which is peculiar to animals and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables;
this ſpecies of unity which always
ſubſiſts, and ſeems to be eternal; this generative
power which is perpetually in action, muſt, with
regard to us, continue to be a myſtery ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,
that we ſhall probably never reach the
bottom of it.</p>
               <p>Even inanimated bodies, the ſtones or the
duſt under our feet, have ſome properties; their
very exiſtence preſuppoſes a great number; and
matter, the moſt imperfectly organized, poſſeſſes
many relations with the other parts of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.
We will not aſſert, with ſome philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
that matter, under whatever form it
appears, is conſcious of its exiſtence and of its
relative powers. This queſtion belongs to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſics,
of which we intend not here to treat.
We ſhall only remark, that, being ignorant of
the extent of our own connections with exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
objects, we cannot heſitate in pronouncing
inanimated matter to be infinitely more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.
Beſides, our ſenſations having not the
moſt diſtant reſemblance to the cauſes which
produce them, analogy obliges us to conclude,
that dead matter is neither endowed with ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with ſenſation, nor with a conſciouſneſs
of its own exiſtence. To attribute any of theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0195400702:7"/>
faculties to it, therefore, would be aſcribing to it
the power of thinking, of acting, and of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
nearly in the ſame manner as we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
think, act, and perceive; which is equally
repugnant to reaſon and to religion.</p>
               <p>With inanimated matter, therefore, though
formed of duſt and clay, we have no other
relations than what ariſe from the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of bodies, namely, extenſion, impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability,
gravity, &amp;c. But, as relations purely
material make no internal impreſſion on us, and,
as they exiſt entirely independent of us, they
cannot be conſidered as any part of our being.
Our exiſtence, therefore, is an effect of organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,
of life, of the ſoul. Matter, in this view,
is not a principal, but an acceſſory. It is a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
covering, united to us in a manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known;
and its preſence is noxious. Thought
is the conſtituent principle of our being, and is
perhaps totally independent of matter.</p>
               <p>We exiſt, then, without knowing how; and
we think, without perceiving the reaſon of
thought. But, whatever be the mode of our
being, or of our thinking, whether our ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be real or apparent, their effects are not the
leſs certain. The train of our ideas, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the objects which occaſion them,
gives riſe to genuine affections, and produces in us
relations to external objects, which we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
as real, becauſe they are uniform and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable.
Thus, agreeable to the nature of our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0195400702:8"/>
being, it is impoſſible to doubt concerning the
reality of thoſe diſtinctions and reſemblances
which we perceive in the bodies that ſurround
us. We may, therefore, conclude, without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,
that man holds the firſt rank in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of nature; and that brute animals hold the
ſecond, vegetables the third, and minerals the
laſt. Though we are unable clearly to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between our animal and ſpiritual qualities;
though the brute creation are endowed with the
ſame ſenſes, the ſame principles of life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and perform many actions in a manner ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to thoſe of man; yet they have not the
ſame extent of relation to external objects; and,
conſequently, their reſemblance to us fails in
numberleſs particulars. We differ ſtill more
from vegetables; but we are more analogous to
them than to minerals; for vegetables poſſeſs a
ſpecies of animated organization; but minerals
have nothing that approaches to regular organs.</p>
               <p>Before we give the hiſtory of an animal, it is
neceſſary to have an exact knowledge of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
order of his peculiar relations, and then to
diſtinguiſh thoſe relations which he has in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with vegetables and with minerals. An
animal poſſeſſes nothing common to the mineral,
but the general properties of matter: His na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and oeconomy, however, are perfectly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
The mineral is inactive, inſenſible, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to every impulſe, without organization, or
the power of reproduction, a rude maſs, fitted
only to be trode by the feet of men and of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0195400702:9"/>
Even the moſt precious metals, which
derive their value only from the conventions of
men, are regarded in no other light by the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.
In the animal, the whole powers of
nature are united. The principles with which
he is animated are peculiar to him: He wills;
he determines; he acts; he communicates, by
his ſenſes, with the moſt diſtant objects; his
body is a world in miniature, a central point to
which every thing in the univerſe is connected.
Theſe are his peculiar and invariable relations:
The faculties of growth and developement, of
reproduction and the multiplication of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
he poſſeſſes in common with the vegetable
kingdom.</p>
               <p>Progreſſive motion appears to be the moſt
diſtinguiſhing quality between an animal and a
vegetable. We, indeed, know no vegetable
that enjoys a progreſſive motion. But this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is denied to ſeveral ſpecies of animals, as
oyſters<note n="*" place="bottom">This is not ſtrictly true; for oyſters, and even gall-inſects, are capable of a degree of progreſſive motion.</note>, gall-inſects, &amp;c. This diſtinction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is neither general nor eſſential.</p>
               <p>Senſation more eſſentially diſtinguiſhes ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
from vegetables. But <hi>ſenſation</hi> is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
idea, and requires ſome explication; for,
if ſenſation implied no more than motion conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
upon a ſtroke or an impulſe, the ſenſitive
plant enjoys this power. But, if by ſenſation
we mean the faculty of perceiving and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
ideas, it is uncertain whether brute ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0195400702:10"/>
are endowed with it. If it ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to dogs, elephants, &amp;c. whoſe actions
ſeem to proceed from motives ſimilar to thoſe
by which men are actuated, it muſt be denied
to many ſpecies of animals, particularly to thoſe
that appear not to poſſeſs the faculty of progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
motion. If the ſenſation of an oyſter, for
example, differed only in degree from that of a
dog, why do we not aſcribe the ſame ſenſation
to vegetables, though in a degree ſtill inferior?
This diſtinction, therefore, between the animal
and vegetable, is neither ſufficiently general nor
determined.</p>
               <p>A third diſtinction has been derived from the
manner of feeding. Animals have organs of
apprehenſion by which they lay hold of their
food; they ſearch for paſture, and have a choice
in their aliment. But plants are under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of receiving ſuch nouriſhment as the ſoil
affords them, without exerting any choice in the
ſpecies of their food, or in the manner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
it: The moiſture of the earth is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſource of their nouriſhment. However, if
we attend to the organization and action of the
roots and leaves, we ſhall ſoon be convinced,
that theſe are the external organs by which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
are enabled to extract their food; that
the roots turn aſide from a vein of bad earth, or
from any obſtacle which they meet with, in
ſearch of a better ſoil; and that they ſplit and
ſeparate their ſibres in different directions, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0195400702:11"/>
even change their form, in order to procure
nouriſhment to the plant. A general diſtinction,
therefore, between the animal and vegetable,
cannot be founded on their manner of feeding.</p>
               <p>From this inveſtigation we are led to conclude,
that there is no abſolute and eſſential diſtinction
between the animal and vegetable kingdoms;
but that nature proceeds by imperceptible degrees
from the moſt perfect to the moſt imperfect ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
and from that to the vegetable: Hence the
freſh water polypus may be regarded as the laſt
of animals, and the firſt of plants.</p>
               <p>After examining the diſtinctions, we ſhall now
inquire into the reſemblances which take place
betwee animals and vegetables. The power of
reproduction is common to the two kingdoms,
and is a reſemblance both univerſal and eſſential.
This mutual faculty would induce us to think
that animals and vegetables are beings of the ſame
order.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reſemblance may be derived from
the expanſion of their parts, which is likewiſe a
common property; for vegetables grow as well
as animals; and, though ſome difference in the
manner of expanſion may be remarked, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
general nor eſſential; ſince the growth of
ſome conſiderable parts of animals, as the bones,
the hairs, the nails, the horns, &amp;c. is the effect
of a genuine vegetation; and the foetus, in its
firſt formation, may be rather ſaid to vegetate
than to live.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0195400702:12"/>
A third reſemblance ariſes from the following
fact: Some animals are propagated in the ſame
manner, and by the ſame means, as vegetables.
The multiplication of the vine-fretter, (<hi>puceron</hi>),
which is effected without copulation, is ſimilar to
that of plants by ſeed; and the multiplication of
the polypus by cutting reſembles that of plants
by ſlips.</p>
               <p>We may now conclude, therefore, with more
certainty, that animals and vegetables are beings
of the ſame order, and that Nature paſſes from
the one to the other by imperceptible degrees;
ſince the properties in which they reſemble each
other are univerſal and eſſential, while thoſe by
which they are diſtinguiſhed are limited and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Let us next proceed to compare animals and
vegetables in different points of view; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
with regard to number, ſituation, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
figure, &amp;c. from which new inductions
will ariſe.</p>
               <p>Animals exceed plants in the number of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
In the claſs of inſects alone, there are,
perhaps, a greater number of ſpecies, than of the
whole ſpecies of plants on the face of the earth.
Animals differ from each other much more than
plants: It is the great ſimilarity of plants that
has given riſe to the difficulty of diſtinguiſhing
and arranging them, and to the variety of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical
ſyſtems, which are much more numerous
than thoſe of zoology.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0195400702:13"/>
Beſide being more ſtrongly characteriſed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſpecies of animal is diſtinguiſhable from
another by copulation. Thoſe may be regarded
as of the ſame ſpecies which, by copulation, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly
produce and perpetuate beings every
way ſimilar to their parents; and thoſe which,
by the ſame means, either produce nothing, or
diſſimilar beings, may be conſidered as of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſpecies. A fox, for example, will be of a
different ſpecies from a dog, if nothing reſults
from the intercourſe of a male and a female of
theſe two animals; or, if the reſult be a diſſimilar
creature, a kind of mule, as this mule cannot
multiply, it will be a ſufficient demonſtration
that the fox and dog are different ſpecies of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
In plants we have not the ſame advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
for, though ſexes have been attributed to
them, and generic diſtinctions have been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the parts of fructification; yet, as theſe
characteriſtics are neither ſo certain nor ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
as in animals; and, as the reproduction
of plants can be accompliſhed by ſeveral methods
which have no dependence on ſexes, or the parts
of fructification, this opinion has not been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful;
and it is only by the miſapplication of
an analogy, that the ſexual ſyſtem has been
pretended to be ſufficient to enable us to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the different ſpecies of the vegetable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Though the ſpecies of animals be more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than thoſe of plants, the number of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0195400702:14"/>
in each ſpecies of the latter far exceed
thoſe of the former. In animals, as well as in
plants, the number of individuals is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the ſmall than in the large kinds. Flies
are infinitely more numerous than elephants;
and there are more herbs than trees. But, if we
compare the quantity of individuals in each ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
the number of the plant far exceeds that of
the animal. Quadrupeds, for example, produce
but few at a time, and at conſiderable intervals.
Trees, on the contrary, produce annually an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
quantity of ſeeds. It may be alledged,
that, to render this compariſon exact, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of ſeeds produced by a tree ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the quantity of germs contained in
the ſemen of an animal; and then, perhaps, it
would appear, that animals abound more in
germs than vegetables. But, by collecting and
ſowing the ſeeds of a ſingle elm tree, 100,000
young elms may be raiſed from the product of
one year. Though a horſe, however, were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with all the mares he could cover in a
year, the reſult between the production of the
animal and of the plant would be very different.
I avoid taking notice of the quantity of germs;
becauſe of theſe, eſpecially in the animal, we
have no certain knowledge, and becauſe the ſame
ſeminal germs may exiſt in the vegetable; for
the ſeed of a plant is not a germ, but a produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as perfect as the foetus of an animal, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0195400702:15"/>
which, like a foetus, requires only the expanſion
of its parts.</p>
               <p>To this may be oppoſed the prodigious mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of ſome kinds of inſects, as the bee,
a ſingle female of which will produce 30 or 40
thouſand. But, it ought to be remarked, that
I am here ſpeaking in general of animals com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with vegetables. Beſides, the bee, which
affords, perhaps, an example of the greateſt
multiplication among animals, proves nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the preſent doctrine; for, out of 30 or
40 thouſand flies produced by the mother-bee,
there are but very few females, 1500 or 2000
males; and all the reſt are of neither ſex, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
incapable of procreating.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that ſome ſpecies of
inſects, fiſhes, and ſhell-animals, appear to be
extremely prolific. Oyſters, herrings, fleas, &amp;c.
are perhaps equally fertile as moſſes, and the
moſt common plants. But, in general, moſt
ſpecies of animals are leſs prolific than plants;
and, upon comparing the multiplication of the
different ſpecies of plants, we find not ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
differences, with regard to number, as
take place among animals. Some animals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
great numbers, and others very few. But,
in every ſpecies of plants, the quantity produced
is always great.</p>
               <p>From what we have already obſerved, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that, both in the animal and vegetable
kingdoms, the ſmalleſt and moſt contemptible
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0195400702:16"/>
ſpecies are the moſt prolific. In proportion as
animals ſeem to be more perfect, the number of
individuals decreaſes. Does the production of
particular forms of body, neceſſary for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of ſentiment, as thoſe of quadrupeds, and
of birds, coſt nature more expence of organic
particles than the production of inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
               <p>Let us now compare animals and vegetables
with regard to ſituation, ſize, and figure. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
can exiſt no where but on the earth.
Moſt of them are attached to the ſoil by roots:
Some, as truffles, are entirely covered with the
ſoil; and a few grow under water. But the
whole require a connection with the ſurface of
the earth. Animals, on the contrary, are more
generally diffuſed. Some inhabit the ſurface, and
others the interior parts of the earth. Some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
riſe above the bottom of the ocean, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſwim in the waters. The air, the internal
parts of plants, the bodies of men and of other
animals, and even ſtones themſelves, are ſtored
with inhabitants.</p>
               <p>By the aſſiſtance of the microſcope, many new
ſpecies of animals have been diſcovered. But,
what is ſingular, we are not indebted to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
for above one or two ſpecies of plants.
The ſmall moſs, of which mouldineſs conſiſts,
is perhaps the only microſcopic plant which has
been deſcribed. From this it would appear, that
Nature has refuſed exiſtence to very ſmall plants,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0195400702:17"/>
while ſhe has created animalcules in the greateſt
profuſion. But this opinion ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
without examination. Plants are ſo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
in their ſtructure, that it is much more
difficult to diſtinguiſh them than animals. This
mouldineſs, which we imagine to be only a very
ſmall moſs, may be a foreſt or a garden conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a multitude of different plants, though
we are unable to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
               <p>Animals and vegetables differ alſo with regard
to ſize. There is a greater diſproportion between
the bulk of a whale and that of one of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
microſcopic animals, than between the
largeſt oak and the ſmall moſs mentioned above.
Though bulk be only a relative attribute, it may
be uſeful to know the limits within which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has confined her productions. As to large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
plants differ but little from animals. The
quantity of matter in a whale and in a large tree
is nearly equal; but, as to ſmallneſs, ſome men
have pretended to have ſeen animals ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minute, that a million of them collected in a
heap, would not equal the ſmall moſs on a piece
of mouldy bread.</p>
               <p>The moſt general and moſt obvious diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between plants and animals ariſes from their
figure. The form of animals, though infinitely
various, has no reſemblance to that of plants:
And, though the polypi, which, like plants, can
be multiplied by cuttings, may be regarded as
the link which connects the animal and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0195400702:18"/>
kingdoms, not only from the manner of
their reproduction, but ſtill more from their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
yet there is no danger of miſtaking the
one for the other. The operations of ſome ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
reſemble plants or flowers. But plants ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
produce any thing ſimilar to an animal; and
thoſe wonderful inſects which make corals,
would never have been miſtaken for flowers, if,
by a fooliſh prejudice, coral had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as a plant. Thus the errors we may
commit in comparing plants and animals, are
confined to a few objects which lie on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of the two kingdoms; and the farther
we extend our obſervations, we ſhall be the more
convinced, that the Creator has inſtituted no
fixed limits between the animal and vegetable;
that theſe two ſpecies of organized beings poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
a greater number of common properties
than of real differences; that the production of
an animal requires, perhaps, a ſmaller exertion
of Nature than the production of a vegetable; or
rather, that the production of organized bodies
requires no immediate exertion at all; and,
laſtly, that animation, or the principle of life,
inſtead of a metaphyſical ſtep in the ſcale of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is a phyſical property common to all
matter.</p>

               <head>Of Reproduction in general.</head>
               <p>WE ſhall now more cloſely examine this
property common to the animal and
vegetable; this faculty of producing beings ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to themſelves; this ſucceſſive chain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals
which conſtitutes the real exiſtence of
the ſpecies: And, without limiting our reſearch
to the generation of man, or of any particular
animal, let us contemplate the general phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
of reproduction; let us collect facts, and
enumerate the various methods employed by
Nature for the renovation and tranſmiſſion of
organized exiſtences.</p>
               <p>The firſt, and apparently the moſt ſimple me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
is to aſſemble in one body an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſimilar organic bodies, and to compoſe its
ſubſtance in ſuch a manner, that every part ſhall
contain a germ or embryo of the ſame ſpecies,
and which might become a whole of the ſame
kind with that of which it conſtitutes a part<note n="*" place="bottom">The intelligent reader will perceive that this ſentence, though not very obvious, contains the principle upon which the ſubſequent theory of generation adopted by the author is founded. It means no more than that the bodies of animals and of vegetables are compoſed of an infinite number of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic particles, perfectly ſimilar, both in figure and ſubſtance, to the whole animal or plant, of which they are the conſtituent parts.</note>.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0195400702:20"/>
This apparatus appears, at firſt ſight, to ſuppoſe
a profuſion of expence. Such magnificence,
however, is not uncommon in Nature. It is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible
even in the more common and inferior
ſpecies, as in worms, polypi, elms, willows,
and many other plants and inſects, every part of
which contains a whole, and, in order to become
a plant or an inſect, requires only to be unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or expanded. Conſidering organized bodies
under this point of view, an individual is a
whole uniformly conſtructed in all parts, a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of an infinite number of particles every
way ſimilar, an aſſemblage of germs or minute
individuals of the ſame ſpecies, which, in certain
circumſtances, are capable of being expanded,
and of becoming new beings like thoſe from
which they were originally ſeparated.</p>
               <p>This idea, when traced to the bottom, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
a relation between animals, vegetables, and
minerals, which we would not have ſuſpected.
Salts, and ſome other minerals, conſiſt of parts
ſimilar to one another, and to the whole. A
grain of ſea-ſalt, as we diſtinctly perceive by the
microſcope, is a cube compoſed of an infinite
number of ſmaller cubes<note n="*" place="bottom">Hae tam parvae quam magnae figurae (ſalium) ex magno ſolum numero minorum particularum, quae eandem figuram habent, ſunt conflatae, ſicuti mihi ſaepe licuit obſervare, cum aquam marinam aut communem in qua ſal commune liquatum erat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

of ſtill ſmaller cubes. The primitive and
conſtituent particles of this ſalt muſt, therefore,
unqueſtionably conſiſt of cubes ſo minute, that
they will for ever eſcape our obſervation. Plants
and animals, which poſſeſs the power of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying

compoſed of ſimilar organic bodies, the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

organic and ſimilar. Of theſe we diſcern the
accumulated quantity; but we can only recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe
the conſtituent particles by reaſon and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
               <p>From this view, we are led to conclude, that
there exiſts in nature an infinity of <hi>organic, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
particles</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">To avoid the introduction of terms which might not be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally underſtood, it is neceſſary to inform the reader, that the phraſes <hi>corbs organiques vivans, parties organiques vivantes,</hi> et <hi>mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules organiques vivantes,</hi> which occur ſo often in this volume, and form the baſis of our auth r's theory, are uniformly, in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, expreſſed by the words <hi>organic particles.</hi>
                  </note>, of the ſame ſubſtance with orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized

remarked in more inanimated matter,
which is compoſed of an infinite number of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
particles that have an exact reſemblance to
the whole body. And, as the accumulation
perhaps of millions of cubes are neceſſary to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0195400702:22"/>
formation of a ſingle grain of ſea-ſalt that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
by our ſenſes, an equal number of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
organic particles are requiſite to produce one
of thoſe numberleſs germs contained in an elm,
or in a polypus. A cube of ſea-ſalt muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
before we can diſcover, by means of
cryſtallization, the minute cubes of which it is
compoſed: In the ſame manner, the parts of an
elm or of a polypus muſt be ſeparated, before we
can recogniſe, by means of vegetation, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion,
the ſmall elms or polypi contained in
the different parts of theſe bodies.</p>
               <p>The difficulty of aſſenting to this idea proceeds
from the well known prejudice, that we can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judge of the compound by the ſimple;
that, to diſcover the organic ſtructure of any
being, it muſt firſt be reduced to its ſimple and
unorganic parts; and that hence it is more eaſy
to conceive how a cube muſt neceſſarily be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of other cubes, than how a polypus can
be compoſed of other polypi. But, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
attentively what is meaned by ſimple and
compound, we ſhall find, that in this, as in every
thing elſe, the plan of Nature is very different
from the groſſneſs and imperfection of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
               <p>Our ſenſes, it is well known, convey not to
us exact repreſentations of external objects.
When we want to calculate, to judge, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare,
to weigh, to meaſure, &amp;c. we are obliged
to have recourſe to foreign aid, to rules, to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0195400702:23"/>
to uſages, to inſtruments, &amp;c. All theſe
adminicles are efforts of human genius, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
more or leſs to the abſtraction of our ideas.
This abſtraction, with regard to us, conſtitutes
the ſimplicity of things; and the difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
them to this abſtraction is the compound.
Extenſion, for example, being a general and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
property of matter, is not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
In order, however, to judge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, we have imagined ſome extenſions to
have no thickneſs, others to have neither thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
nor breadth, and points, which are exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
without being extended. All theſe abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been invented as ſupports to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;
and the few definitions employed
in geometry have given riſe to numberleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
and falſe conceptions. Whatever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
under any of theſe definitions is called
ſimple; and ſuch things as cannot be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to this ſtandard are conſidered as complex.
Thus, a triangle, a ſquare, a circle, a cube, and
all thoſe curves of which we know the geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical
properties, are regarded as ſimple. But
every thing which we cannot reduce under theſe
ſigures, or abſtract rules, appears to us to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex.
We never reflect, that all theſe geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſigures exiſt no where but in our own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
or that, if they are ever found in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is only becauſe ſhe exhibits every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
form; and the appearance of ſimple figures,
as an exact cube, or an equilateral pyramid, is,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0195400702:24"/>
perhaps, more difficult and rare to be found in
nature, than the complex forms of plants or of
animals. It is in this manner that we perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
conſider the abſtract as ſimple, and the real
as complex. But, in nature, no abſtract exiſts;
nothing is ſimple; every object is compounded.
We are unable to penetrate into the intimate
ſtructure of bodies. We cannot, therefore, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
what objects are more or leſs complex,
unleſs by the greater or leſs relation they have
to ourſelves, and to the reſt of the univerſe. For
this reaſon, we regard the animal as being more
complex than the vegetable, and the vegetable
than the mineral. With reſpect to us, this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is juſt; but we know not whether the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
vegetable, or mineral, be, in reality, the moſt
complex or the moſt ſimple; and we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
whether the production of a globe or a
cube requires a greater effort of Nature than that
of a germ, or an organic particle. If we were
to indulge in conjectures upon this ſubject, we
might imagine the moſt common and moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
objects to be the moſt ſimple. But this
would make animals more ſimple than plants or
minerals, becauſe the former exceed the latter in
number of ſpecies.</p>
               <p>But, without dwelling longer on this ſubject,
it is ſufficient to have ſhown, that all our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning ſimple and compound are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
ideas; that they cannot be applied to the
complex operations of nature; that, when we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0195400702:25"/>
attempt to reduce all bodies into elements of a
cubical, priſmatic, globular, or any other regular
figure, we ſubſtitute our own imaginations in
oppoſition to real exiſtences; and that the forms
of the conſtituent particles of different bodies
are abſolutely unknown to us; and, of courſe, we
may believe or ſuppoſe that organized beings
are compoſed of ſimilar organic particles, as well
as that a cube conſiſts of other cubes. We have
no other method of judging but by experience.
We know that a cube of ſea-ſalt is compoſed
of many leſſer cubes, and that an elm conſiſts of
a great number of minute elms; becauſe, if we
take a piece of a branch, of a root, of the wood
ſeparated from the trunk, or a ſeed, from all
theſe a new tree is produced. The polypus,
and ſome other ſpecies of animals, may likewiſe
be multiplied by cuttings ſeparated from any
part of their bodies; and, as our rule of judging
in both caſes is the ſame, why ſhould we form
a different opinion concerning them?</p>
               <p>The above reaſoning renders it extremely
probable, that there really exiſts in nature an
infinite number of ſmall organized beings, every
way ſimilar to thoſe large organized bodies
which make ſuch a conſpicuous figure in this
world; that theſe ſmall organized beings are
compoſed of living organic particles, which are
common both to animals and vegetables, and are
their primary and incorruptible elements; that
an aſſemblage of theſe particles conſtitutes an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0195400702:26"/>
animal or a plant; and, conſequently, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>production
or generation is nothing but a change
of form, effected ſolely by the addition of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
particles; and the death, or reſolution of
organized bodies, is only a ſeparation of the
ſame particles. Of the truth of this doctrine,
not a doubt will remain, after the proofs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the following chapters are peruſed.
Beſides, if we reflect on the growth of trees, and
conſider what an immenſe maſs is produced from
ſo ſmall an origin, we muſt be perſuaded that this
increaſe of matter is effected by the ſimple addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of organic particles which are ſimilar to one
another, and to the whole. The ſeed firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a ſmall tree, which it contains in minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
within its coats. At the top of this ſmall
tree a bud is formed, which contains the tree
that is to ſpring the next ſeaſon; and this bud
is an organized body ſimilar to the ſmall tree of
the preceding year. The ſmall tree of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
year, in the ſame manner, produces a bud
which contains a tree for the third year; and
this proceſs uniformly goes on as long as the
tree continues to vegetate: Buds are likewiſe
formed at the extremity of each branch, which
contain, in miniature, trees ſimilar to that of the
firſt year. It is evident, therefore, that trees are
compoſed of minute organized bodies ſimilar to
themſelves, and that the whole individual is
formed by a numerous aſſemblage of minute and
ſimilar individuals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0195400702:27"/>
But, it may be demanded, were not all theſe
minute, and ſimilarly organized bodies, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſeed? and may not the order of their
unfolding be traced from that ſource? for it is
apparent, that the firſt bud was ſurmounted by
a ſimilar bud, which was not expanded till the
ſecond year, and the third bud was not unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till the third year; and, conſequently, the ſeed
may be ſaid to have really contained the whole
buds which would be formed for 100 years, or
till the diſſolution of the plant: It is alſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that this ſeed contained not only all the
ſmall organized bodies which muſt in time have
conſtituted the individual tree itſelf, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
all the ſeeds, and all the individuals which
would ſucceſſively ariſe, till the final deſtruction
of the ſpecies.</p>
               <p>This, indeed, is a capital difficulty; and we
ſhall therefore examine it with the greater at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
It is true, that the ſeed produced a
ſmall tree the firſt year, ſolely by the unfolding
of the bud or germ which it contained, and that
this ſmall tree exiſted in miniature in the bud.
But it is not equally certain that the bud of the
ſecond year, and thoſe of the ſucceeding years,
nor that all the ſmall organic bodies, and the
ſeeds which muſt have been formed till the end
of the world, or the deſtruction of the ſpecies,
were contained in the firſt ſeed. This opinion
ſuppoſes an infinite progreſſion, and makes every
individual a ſource of eternal generations. The
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0195400702:28"/>
firſt ſeed, for inſtance, muſt have included all
the plants of its ſpecies which have exiſted, or
ever will exiſt; and the firſt man muſt have
contained in his loins all the men who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
or will appear, on the face of the earth.
Every ſeed, and every animal, according to this
doctrine, muſt have included in its own body an
infinite poſterity. If we yield to reaſonings of
this kind, we muſt loſe ſight of truth in the
labyringths of infinity; and, in place of ſolving,
or of throwing light upon the queſtion, we will
involve it in tenfold obſcurity. It is removing
the object beyond the reach of our viſion, and
then complaining that we cannot ſee it.</p>
               <p>Let us inveſtigate the nature of the ideas of
infinite progreſſion and expanſion. How do we
acquire them? In what do they inſtruct us? We
derive the idea of infinity from the idea of what
is limited. It is in this manner we obtain the
ideas of infinite ſucceſſion, and geometrical infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
Every individual is a unit; ſeveral indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
make a limited number; and a whole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
is to us an infinite multitude. From the
ſame data which we have demonſtrated the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entity
of geometrical infinity, we might prove,
that infinite ſucceſſion, or propagation, reſts on
no firmer baſis; that it is only an abſtract idea,
a mere deduction from the idea of finite objects,
by lopping off the limits which neceſſarily ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
every magnitude<note n="*" place="bottom">See this fully demonſtrated in my preface to the French tranſlation of Newton's fluxions, p. 7.</note>; and, of courſe, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0195400702:29"/>
every opinion which infallibly leads to the idea
of actual exiſtence, upon no better authority
than what is derived from geometrical or nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
infinity, ought to be rejected.</p>
               <p>The partizans of this opinion are now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the neceſſity of acknowledging, that
their infinity of ſucceſſion and of multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is only an indeterminable or indefinite
number. But, ſay they, the firſt ſeed, of an
elm for example, which weighs not a grain,
actually contains all the organic particles requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
for the formation of this tree, and of all the
individuals of the ſame ſpecies which ſhall ever
appear. Is this a ſolution of the difficulty? Is
it not cutting the knot, in place of untying it?</p>
               <p>When, is reply to the queſtion, how beings
are multiplied? it is anſwered, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
was compleated in the creation of the
firſt individuals, is not this both an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of ignorance, and a renouncing of all
deſire of farther improvement? We aſk how
one being produces its like? and we receive for
anſwer, that the whole was created at once. A
ſtrange ſolution; for, whether only one or a
thouſand generations had paſſed, the ſame diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
remains, and, inſtead of removing it, the
ſuppoſition of an indefinite number of germs, all
exiſting and contained in a ſingle germ, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and renders it altogether incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>I allow, that it is much eaſier to find fault,
than to inveſtigate truth, and that the queſtion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0195400702:30"/>
concerning reproduction is perhaps of ſuch a
ſubtile nature, as not to admit of a full and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
explication. But we ought at leaſt to
inquire whether it be altogether inſcrutable; and,
in the courſe of this inquiry, we will diſcover all
that can be known, and the reaſon why we can
know no more.</p>
               <p>Queſtions or inquiries are of two kinds; the
firſt regard primary cauſes, the other particular
effects. If, for example, it be aſked why mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is impenetrable? we muſt either return no
anſwer, or reply by ſaying, that matter is
impenetrable, becauſe it is impenetrable. The
ſame anſwer muſt be made, if we inquire
into the cauſe of gravity, of extenſion, of the
inertia of bodies, or of any general quality of
matter. Such is the nature of all general and
abſtract qualities, that, having no mode of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
them with other objects in which they
do not exiſt, we are totally incapable of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concerning them; and therefore all inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of this kind, being beyond the powers of
human intellect, are perfectly uſeleſſs.</p>
               <p>But, on the other hand, if the reaſon of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
effects be demanded, we are always in a
condition to give a diſtinct anſwer, whenever we
can ſhow that theſe effects are produced by one
of the general cauſes; and the queſtion is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſolved, whether the particular effect proceeds
immediately from a general cauſe, or from a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0195400702:31"/>
chain of ſucceſſive effects, provided we have a
clear conception of the dependence of theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
upon each other, and of their mutual rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But, when a particular effect appears not to
have any dependence upon more general effects,
or has no analogy to effects already known, we
are then totally unable to give any explication
of it; becauſe we have no ſimilar object with
which it can be compared. We cannot explain
a general cauſe, becauſe it equally exiſts in every
object; and, on the contrary, we can give no
account of a ſingular or iſolated effect; becauſe
the ſame qualities exiſt not in any other ſubject.
To explain a general cauſe, we muſt diſcover one
ſtill more general; but a ſingular and detached
effect may be illuſtrated by the diſcovery of an
analogous effect, which experience or accident
may exhibit.</p>
               <p>There is ſtill another kind of queſtion, which
may be called a queſtion of fact. For example,
why do trees, dogs, &amp;c. exiſt? All queſtions of
this kind are perfectly inſoluble; for thoſe who
ſolve them by final cauſes conſider not that they
miſtake the effect for the cauſe: The relation of
particular objects to ourſelves has no connection
with their origin. Moral affinity or fitneſs can
never become a phyſical reaſon.</p>
               <p>Queſtions in which we employ the word <hi>Why,</hi>
ought to be carefully diſtinguiſhed from thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0195400702:32"/>
in which we employ <hi>How,</hi> and ſtill more from
thoſe in which we ought to uſe the words <hi>how
much</hi> or <hi>how many. Why</hi> always relates to the
cauſe of the effect, or to the effect itſelf; <hi>how</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the manner in which the effect happens;
and <hi>how much</hi> relates to the meaſure or quantity
of the effect.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſtinctions being eſtabliſhed, let us now
examine the queſtion concerning the reproduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of beings. If it be demanded <hi>why</hi> animals
and vegetables continue their ſpecies? we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive that this is a queſtion of fact, and
therefore that it is uſeleſs and inſolvable. But,
if it be aſked <hi>how</hi> animals and vegetables are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produced?
we are enabled to ſolve the queſtion,
by giving the hiſtory of the generation of every
ſpecies of animal, and of the reproduction of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſpecies of plant: After tracing, however,
every poſſible method of propagation, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the moſt exact obſervations, we have only
learned the facts; but have not diſcovered the
cauſes: And, as the means Nature employs in
multiplying and continuing the ſpecies, ſeem to
have no relation to the effects produced, we are
ſtill under the neceſſity of aſking, by what ſecret
cauſe ſhe enables beings to propagate their
kinds?</p>
               <p>This queſtion is very different from the firſt
and ſecond. It admits of nice ſcrutiny, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
allows us to employ the powers of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It is, therefore, by no means inſolvable;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0195400702:33"/>
for it belongs not to a general cauſe. Neither
is it ſolely a queſtion of fact: And, if we can
conceive a method of reproduction, depending
on primary cauſes, or which, at leaſt, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to them, we ought to be ſatisfied with
it; and the more relation it has to the other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Nature, it will reſt upon a firmer baſis.</p>
               <p>By the nature of the queſtion, then, we are
permitted to form hypotheſes, and to chuſe that
which appears to have the greateſt analogy to the
other phaenomena of nature. But we ought to
reject every hypotheſis which ſuppoſes the thing
to be already accompliſhed, ſuch, for example,
as that which ſuppoſes the firſt germ to contain
all the germs of the ſame ſpecies, or that every
reproduction is a new creation, an immediate
effect of the will of the Deity; for all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes
of this kind are mere matters of fact, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which it is impoſſible to reaſon. We
muſt likewiſe reject every hypotheſis which is
founded on final cauſes, ſuch as, that reproduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ordained in order to replace the living
for the dead; that the earth may always be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with vegetables and peopled with animals;
that men may be ſupplied with abundance of
nouriſhment, &amp;c.; for ſuch hypotheſes, in place
of explaining the effect by phyſical cauſes, ſtand
on no other foundation than arbitrary relations
and moral affinities. We ought, at the ſame
time, to deſpiſe thoſe general axioms and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
problems ſo frequently and ſo injudiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0195400702:34"/>
employed as principles by ſome philoſophers,
ſuch as, `Nulla foecundatio extra corpus;' e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
living creature proceeds from an egg; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
always ſuppoſes ſexes, &amp;c. Theſe max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
muſt not be taken in an abſolute ſenſe; they
ſignify no more than that the thing happens
more commonly in this manner than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Let us, then, endeavour to find an hypotheſis
that will be liable to none of theſe defects or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances;
and, if we ſhall not ſucceed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
the mechaniſm employed by Nature for
the reproduction of beings, we ſhall, at leaſt, be
able to approach nearer to the truth than we
have hitherto arrived.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner as we make moulds by
which we can beſtow on the external parts of
bodies whatever figure we pleaſe, let us ſuppoſe,
that Nature can form moulds by which ſhe
beſtows on bodies both an external and internal
figure; would not this be one method by which
reproduction might be effected?</p>
               <p>Let us firſt conſider whether this ſuppoſition
be well founded; let us examine whether it
contains any thing that is abſurd or contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
and then we ſhall diſcover what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
may be drawn from it. Though our
ſenſes reach not beyond the external parts of
bodies, we have clear ideas of their different ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and external affections, and we can imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Nature, by repreſenting external figures in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0195400702:35"/>
different ways, as by painting, by ſculpture, and
by moulds. But, though our ſenſes be limited
to external qualities, we know that bodies poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
internal qualities, ſome of which are general,
as gravity. This quality or power acts not in
proportion to the ſurfaces, but to the maſſes, or
quantities of matter. Thus, there are in Nature
powers, and even of the moſt active kind, which
penetrate the internal parts of matter. We
are unable to form diſtinct ideas of ſuch qualities;
becauſe, not being external, they fall not under
the cogniſance of our ſenſes. But we can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their effects, and may draw analogies from
them, in order to account for the effects of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
qualities.</p>
               <p>If our eyes, in place of repreſenting to us only
the ſurfaces of bodies, were ſo conſtructed as to
perceive their internal parts alone, we ſhould then
have clear ideas of the latter, without knowing
any thing of the former. Upon this ſuppoſition,
moulds for the internal conſtitution, which I have
ſuppoſed to be employed by Nature, would be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obvious and eaſy to conceive as moulds for the
external figures of bodies; and we ſhould then
be in a condition to imitate the internal parts of
bodies, as we now imitate the external. Theſe
internal moulds, though beyond our reach, may
be in the poſſeſſion of Nature, as ſhe endows
bodies with gravity, which penetrates every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of matter. The ſuppoſition of internal
moulds being thus founded on analogy, let us
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0195400702:36"/>
next examine whether it involves any contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It may be alledged, that the expreſſion, <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mould,</hi> includes two oppoſite and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
ideas; for the idea of a <hi>mould</hi> relates only to
the furface; but the idea of internal, as here em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
has a relation to the whole maſs; and
therefore we might, with equal propriety, talk
of a maſſy furface as of an internal mould.</p>
               <p>I allow, that, when ideas are attempted to be
repreſented which have never been expreſſed,
we are ſometimes obliged to uſe terms that are
apparently contradictory. To avoid this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
philoſophers have been accuſtomed to
employ unuſual terms, in place of thoſe which
have a received ſignification. But this artifice
is of no uſe, when we can ſhow, that the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contradiction lies in the words, and not in
the idea. But a ſimple idea cannot include a
contradiction; i. e. whenever we can form an
idea of a thing, if this idea be ſimple, it cannot
be complex; it can include no other idea; and,
of courſe, it can contain nothing that is oppoſite
or contradictory.</p>
               <p>Simple ideas are not only the firſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
received by the ſenſes, but the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons
which we form of theſe apprehenſions:
For the firſt apprehenſion is always the reſult of
compariſon. The idea of the largeneſs or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of an object neceſſarily implies a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
with bulk or diſtance in general. Thus,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0195400702:37"/>
when a idea includes nothing more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
it ought to be regarded as ſimple; and,
conſequently, it can contain nothing contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
The idea of an internal mould is of this
ſpecies. There is in nature a quality known by
the name of gravity, which penetrates the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
parts of bodies. I underſtand the idea of
an internal mould to be relative to gravity; and,
therefore, as it includes only a compariſon, it
can imply no contradiction.</p>
               <p>Let us now trace the conſequences that may
be drawn from this ſuppoſition; let us likewiſe
inveſtigate ſuch facts as may correſpond with it;
and the more analogies we can collect, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
will be rendered the more probable. We
ſhall begin with unfolding the idea of external
moulds, and how it may lead us to conceive the
mode of reproduction.</p>
               <p>Nature, in general, appears to have a greater
bias towards life than death: She ſeems anxious
to organize bodies as much as poſſible. Of this
the multiplication of germs, which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
increaſed, is a convincing proof; and it
may be ſafely affirmed, that, if all matter is not
organized, it is only becauſe organized beings
deſtroy one another; for we can increaſe, at
pleaſure, the number of animals and vegetables;
but we cannot augment the quantity of ſtones
or of dead matter. This appears to indicate, that
the moſt ordinary and familiar operation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0195400702:38"/>
is the production of organized bodies; and
here her power knows no limitation.</p>
               <p>To render this more plain, we ſhall calculate
what may be produced by a ſingle germ. The
ſeed of an elm, which weighs not above the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
part of an ounce, will, in 100 years, form
a tree, of which the maſs will amount to ten
cubic fathoms. But, at the tenth year, this elm
will have produced 1000 ſeeds, each of which, in
100 years more, will conſiſt of ten cubic fathoms.
Thus, in the ſpace of 110 years, more than
10,000 cubic fathoms of organized matter are
produced. Ten years after, we ſhall have ten
million of fathoms, without including the annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
increaſe of 10,000, which would amount to
100,000 more; and, in ten years more, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of cubic fathoms would be 10,000,000,000,000.
Hence, in 130 years, a ſingle germ would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a maſs of organized matter equal to 1000
cubic leagues; for a cubic league contains only
about 10,000,000,000 cubic fathoms; ten years
after, this maſs would be increaſed to a thouſand
times a thouſand leagues, or one million of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic
leagues; and, in ten more, it would amount
to 1,000,000,000,000 cubic leagues; ſo that,
in the ſpace of 150 years, the whole globe might
be converted into organized matter of a ſingle
ſpecies. Nature would know no bounds in the
production of organized bodies, if her progreſs
were not obſtructed by matter which is not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0195400702:39"/>
of organization; and this is a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
that ſhe has no tendency to increaſe
brute matter; that her ſole object is the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of organized beings; and that, in this
operation, ſhe never ſtops but when irreſiſtible
obſtacles occur. What we have remarked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſeed of an elm, may be extended to
any other germ; and it would be eaſy to ſhow,
that, by hatching all the eggs which are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by hens for a courſe of 30 years, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of fowls would be ſo great as to cover the
whole ſurface of the earth.</p>
               <p>Calculations of this kind evince the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Nature towards the production of orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
bodies, and the facility with which ſhe
performs the operation. But I will not ſtop
here. Inſtead of dividing matter into <hi>orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized</hi>
and <hi>brute matter,</hi> the general diviſion ought
to be into <hi>living</hi> and <hi>dead matter.</hi> That what
is called <hi>brute matter</hi> is nothing but matter
produced by the <hi>death</hi> of animals and vegetables,
might be proven from the enormous quantities
of ſhells, and other relicts of living bodies,
which conſtitute the principal part of ſtones,
marbles, clays, marles, earths, turfs, and other
ſubſtances that are commonly reckoned <hi>brute
matter,</hi> but are, in reality, compoſed of decayed
animals and vegetables. This doctrine will be
farther illuſtrated by the ſubſequent remarks,
which appear to be well founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0195400702:40"/>
The great facility and activity of Nature in
the production of organized bodies, the exiſtence
of infinite numbers of organic particles which
conſtitute life, have been already demonſtrated.
We now proceed to inquire into the principal
cauſes of death and deſtruction. In general,
beings which have a power of converting matter
into their own ſubſtances, or of aſſimilating the
parts of other beings, are the greateſt deſtroyers.
Fire, for example, which converts almoſt every
ſpecies of matter into its own ſubſtance, is the
greateſt ſource of deſtruction that we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with. Animals ſeem to partake of the
nature of flame; their internal heat is a ſpecies
of fire next to flame. Accordingly, animals are
the greateſt deſtroyers; and they aſſimilate and
convert into their own ſubſtance all bodies which
can ſerve them for nouriſhment. But, though
theſe two cauſes of deſtruction be very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and their effects tend perpetually to the
deſtruction of organized bodies, the cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>production
is infinitely more active and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
It even ſeems to derive, from deſtruction
itſelf, freſh powers of multiplying; for aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milation,
which is one cauſe of death, is, at
the ſame time, a neceſſary mean of producing
life.</p>
               <p>The deſtruction of organized bodies, as has
been remarked, is only a ſeparation of the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic
particles of which they are compoſed. Theſe
particles continue ſeparate till they be again u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0195400702:41"/>
by ſome active power. But what is this
power? It is the power, poſſeſſed by animals
and vegetables, of aſſimilating the matter of their
food; and is not this the ſame, or nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with the ſame power which is the cauſe
of reproduction?</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head>Of Nutrition and Growth.</head>
               <p>AN animal body is a kind of internal mould,
in which the nutritive matter is ſo aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated
to the whole, that, without changing
the order or proportion of the parts, each part
receives an augmentation. This increaſe of
bulk has, by ſome philoſophers, been called an
expanſion or unfolding of the parts; becauſe
they fancied they had accounted for the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,
by telling us, that the form of an
animal in embryo was the ſame as at full matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and that, therefore, it was eaſy to conceive
how its parts ſhould be proportionally unfolded
and augmented by the addition of acceſſory
matter.</p>
               <p>But, how can we have a clear idea of this aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
or expanſion, if we conſider not the
bodies of animals, and each of their parts, as ſo
many internal moulds which receive the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory
matter in the order that reſults from their
poſition and ſtructure? This expanſion cannot
be effected ſolely by an addition to the ſurfaces,
but, on the contrary, by an intus-ſuſception, or
by penetrating the whole maſs; for the ſize of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0195400702:43"/>
the part is augmented proportionally, without
changing its form. Hence it is neceſſary, that
the increaſing matter muſt, in ſome manner or
other, intimately penetrate the whole part in all
its dimenſions: It is equally neceſſary, that this
penetration ſhould be effected in a fixed order
and proportion, ſo that no internal point receive
more matter than another; otherwiſe ſome parts
would be more quickly unfolded than others,
which would entirely change their figure. What
can thus regulate the acceſſory matter, and force
it to arrive equally and proportionally to every
internal point of the body, if we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to an internal mould?</p>
               <p>The bodies of animals and of vegetables, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
conſiſt of internal moulds, which uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſerve the ſame figure. But their maſſes
may receive a proportional increaſe, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion
of the moulds in all their dimenſions,
both internal and external; and this expanſion
is effected by an intus-ſuſception of an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory
and foreign matter, which intimately pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates
the whole, and aſſumes the ſame form
and identity of ſubſtance with the matter of the
moulds themſelves.</p>
               <p>But what is the nature of that matter which
an animal, or a vegetable, aſſimilates to its own
ſubſtance? What beſtows on it that force and
activity which enables it to penetrate the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mould? If ſuch a power exiſts, muſt it not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0195400702:44"/>
be ſimilar to that by which the mould itſelf is
capable of being reproduced?</p>
               <p>Theſe three queſtions include the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and appear to depend on one another; for
it is impoſſible to explain, in a ſatisfactory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the reproduction of animals or vegetables,
if we have not a clear idea how the operation
of nutrition is performed. Each queſtion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
demands a ſeparate examination, that we
may be enabled to compare their reſults.</p>
               <p>The firſt, which regards the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the nutritive matter, is in part reſolved
by the preceding reaſonings, and ſhall be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unfolded in the ſubſequent chapters. We
ſhall demonſtrate, that there are in nature infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
numbers of living organic particles; that
nature produces them without any expence,
becauſe their exiſtence is conſtant and invariable;
that the cauſes of death only diſunite theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
but do not deſtroy them. Thus the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aſſimilated by an animal or vegetable, is an
organic matter of the ſame nature with that of
the animal or vegetable, and, conſequently, may
augment the ſize without changing the figure or
the qualities of the original moulds; becauſe it
has the ſame qualities and the ſame form with
the matter of which the moulds themſelves are
compoſed. Of the quantity of aliment taken
by an animal to ſupport its life, and to maintain
the vigour of its organs, and of the juices ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed
by the roots and leaves of a plant, a great
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0195400702:45"/>
part is rejected by tranſpiration, by ſecretions,
and by other excretories; and a ſmall portion
only is retained for the nouriſhment and expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the parts. It is extremely probable, that,
in the bodies of animals and of vegetables, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is made between the <hi>brute</hi> particles of
the aliment and the organic; that the former are
carried off by the methods juſt mentioned; that
nothing but the organic particles remain; and
that they are diſtributed, by means of ſome active
power, to the different parts, in a proportion ſo
exact, that neither more nor fewer are applied
than anſwer the purpoſes of nutrition, and of an
equal growth and expanſion.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond queſtion, What is the nature
of that active power, which enables the organic
matter to penetrate and combine with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mould? It is apparent, from the preceding
chapter, that powers exiſt in nature, like that of
gravity, which affect the moſt internal parts of
matter, without having the ſmalleſt relation to
its external qualities. Theſe powers, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerved, are beyond the reach of our ſenſes;
becauſe their action is exerted upon the intimate
ſtructure of bodies. It is evident, therefore, that
we can never obtain a clear idea of them, nor
of their mode of acting. Their exiſtence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
is not leſs certain, than that, by means of
them, moſt natural effects are produced, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe of nutrition and expanſion, which
muſt be owing to a cauſe which penetrates the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0195400702:46"/>
moſt intimate receſſes of the original moulds;
for, in the ſame manner as gravity pervades the
whole parts of matter, the power which puſhes
forward or attracts the organic particles of food,
penetrates the internal parts of organized bodies;
and, as theſe bodies have a certain form, which
we have diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
moulds,</hi> the organic particles, puſhed on
by the action of this penetrating force, muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in an order relative to this form, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot alter its figure, but only augment
its bulk, and give riſe to the growth and expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of organized bodies: And if, in the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
body, thus expanded, there be ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
ſimilar to the whole, both internally and
externally, theſe parts will become the ſource of
reproduction.</p>
               <p>Let us now examine the third queſtion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Is it not by a ſimilar power that the internal
mould itſelf is reproduced? This power appears to
be not only ſimilar, but the very ſame with that
which is the cauſe of expanſion and reproduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for, in an organized and expanded body,
nothing farther is neceſſary for the reproduction
of a new body ſimilar to itſelf, than that it ſhould
contain ſome particle every way ſimilar to the
whole. This particle, at its firſt ſeparation, will
not preſent to our eyes a ſenſible figure by which
we can compare it with the whole body. But,
when ſeparated from the body, and put in a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
to receive proper nouriſhment, this ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0195400702:47"/>
particle will begin to expand and to exhibit
the form of an entire and independent being, of
the ſame ſpecies with that from which it was
detached. Thus, a willow or a polypus, as they
contain a larger proportion of particles ſimilar
to the whole, than moſt other ſubſtances, when
cut into any indefinite number of pieces, each
ſegment becomes a new body ſimilar to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from which it was ſeparated.</p>
               <p>Now, in a body of which all the particles are
ſimilar to itſelf, the organization is the moſt
ſimple, as has been remarked in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for it is only a repetition of the ſame form,
a congeries of figures ſimilarly organized. It is
for this reaſon that the moſt ſimple bodies, the
moſt imperfect ſpecies, are moſt eaſily and moſt
abundantly reproduced. But, if an organized
body contain only few particles ſimilar to itſelf,
as theſe alone are capable of a ſecond expanſion,
its power of reproducing will be both more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
and more circumſcribed as to the number
produced. The organization of bodies of this
laſt kind is alſo more complex, becauſe it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
fewer parts which are ſimilar to the whole;
and, therefore, the more perfectly a body is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized,
its power of reproduction will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally
diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>In this manner we diſcover nouriſhment,
growth, and propagation, to be effects of the ſame
cauſe. Organized bodies are nouriſhed by the
particles of aliment which are ſimilar to them;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0195400702:48"/>
they grow or are expanded by abſorbing thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles which correſpond to their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and they propagate, becauſe they contain
ſome organic particles ſimilar to themſelves. It
only remains to examine whether theſe ſimilar
organic particles are extracted from the food, or
have a primary and independent exiſtence in the
bodies themſelves. If we ſuppoſe the latter, we
recur to the infinity of ſimilar parts or germs
contained within each other, an hypotheſis which
we have already demonſtrated to be replete with
difficulties and abſurdities. We muſt, therefore,
hold, that the ſimilar parts are extracted from the
food; and, after what has been ſaid on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
we hope to be able to explain the manner
of their abſorption, and how the more minute
organic particles which compoſe them are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited.</p>
               <p>We formerly remarked, that the organic parts
of food were ſeparated from thoſe which have
no analogy to the animal or vegetable, by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
and other excretions. The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
and ſerve to expand and nouriſh the body:
But theſe organic parts muſt be of very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſpecies; and, as each part of the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
only a proper number of thoſe which corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond
to it, the ſurplus, it is natural to imagine,
will be returned from all parts of the body, and
be collected in one or more reſervoirs, where they
will unite and form ſmall organic bodies ſimilar
to the firſt, and which require nothing but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0195400702:49"/>
circumſtances for expanding and becoming
new individuals of the ſame ſpecies; for, all parts
of the body ſending off organic particles ſimilar
to thoſe of which themſelves are compoſed, the
reſult of their union muſt be the production of
new organized bodies ſimilar to the original.
This being granted, may we not conclude, that
this is the reaſon why organized bodies, during
the time of their growth and expanſion, are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or never capable of reproducing; becauſe
the growing parts abſorb the whole organic par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
preſented to them, and no ſurplus being
ſent from the different parts of the body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
becomes, of courſe, impracticable?</p>
               <p>This account of nutrition, and of reproduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will not, perhaps, be received by thoſe phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
who admit only a certain number of
mechanical principles, and reject every thing as
falſe which depends not upon them; and, as the
explication now given of nutrition and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
has no connection with any of theſe
principles, they will conclude that it deſerves
no credit. But I think very differently from
theſe philoſophers. In admitting only a few
mechanical principles, they conſider not how
much they contract the bounds of philoſophy,
and how few phaenomena can, by this narrow
method of thinking, be fully expiſcated.</p>
               <p>The notion of explaining all the appearances
in nature upon the principles of mechaniſm, is,
doubtleſs, a great exertion, and was firſt attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0195400702:50"/>
by Des Cartes. But it is, at leaſt, an unte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible
project; and, though it were otherwiſe,
we are unable to put it in execution. Theſe
mechanical principles are, the extenſion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
its impenetrability, its motion, its external
figure, its diviſibility, the communication of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by impulſe, by the action of ſprings, &amp;c.
Theſe ideas we have acquired by our ſenſes, and
we regard them as principles, becauſe they are
general and common to all matter. But are we
certain that matter poſſeſſes no other qualities?
Ought we not rather to believe that theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which we aſſume for principles, are only
modes of perception; and that, if the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our ſenſes were different, we would
recognize qualities in matter very different from
thoſe above enumerated? It is preſumptuous to
deny every quality to matter but thoſe we are
acquainted with. Many general qualities, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
remain to be diſcovered; and many may
exiſt which will for ever elude human diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The cauſe of impulſion, of coheſion, or
of any other mechanical principle, will always
continue to be equally inſcrutable as that of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
or of any other general quality. Hence
it may be concluded, that mechanical principles
are nothing elſe than general effects which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
has enabled us to remark in matter;
and that, whenever we ſhall diſcover, either by
reflection, by analogy, or by experience, a new
general effect, it will become a new mechanical
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0195400702:51"/>
principle, which may be employed with equal
advantage and certainty as any of thoſe that are
already known.</p>
               <p>The defect of Ariſtotle's philoſophy was the
employing particular effects as cauſes; and that
of Des Cartes conſiſts in the rejection of every
cauſe, but a few general effects. To uſe nothing
as cauſes but general effects, to endeavour to
augment the number of theſe, and to attempt to
generalize particular effects, would conſtitute the
moſt perfect principles of genuine philoſophy.</p>
               <p>In my theory of expanſion and reproduction,
I firſt admit the mechanical principles, then the
penetrating force of gravity, and, from analogy
and experience, I have concluded the exiſtence
of other penetrating forces peculiar to organized
bodies. I have proved by facts, that matter has
a ſtrong tendency towards organization; and
that there are in nature an infinite number of
organic particles. I have, therefore, only gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized
particular obſervations, without advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
any thing contrary to mechanical principles,
when that term is uſed in its proper ſenſe, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting
the general effects of Nature.</p>

               <head>Of the Generation of Animals.</head>
               <p>AS the organization of men, and of other
animals, is the moſt perfect, and the

as can be multiplied by a ſeparation of their

having been ſufficiently treated of in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
chapter<note n="*" place="bottom">Here the Author gives an unneceſſary recapitulation of Chap. III. to which the reader is referred.</note>.</p>
               <p>But how will the theory delivered in the
former chapter apply to the generation of men,
and other animals, who are diſtinguiſhed by
ſexes? We underſtand, from what has been ſaid,
how every individual may reproduce; but we
cannot conceive how two individuals, the one a
male, and the other a female, ſhould uniformly
produce a third.</p>
               <p>Before replying to this objection, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that the writers on this ſubject have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
their ideas ſolely to the generation of men
and of animals, without attending to the nature
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0195400702:53"/>
of reproduction in general: And, as the generation
of animals is the moſt complicated ſpecies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>production,
they have laboured under great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages,
not only by attacking the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
point, but by leaving themſelves no ſubject
of compariſon to enable them to illuſtrate the
queſtion. To this circumſtance I chiefly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the unſucceſsfulneſs of their attempts. But,
by the route I have taken, I am perſuaded that
I ſhall be able to give a ſatisfactory explanation
of every ſpecies of reproduction.</p>
               <p>Let the generation of man ſerve as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
To begin with infancy:</p>
               <p>The expanſion and growth of the different
parts of man's body being effected by the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
penetration of organic particles analogous
to each of theſe parts, all the organic particles, in
early life, are abſorbed, and entirely employed
in unfolding and augmenting his different mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
He has, of courſe, little or no ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
particles, till his growth be completed. It is
for this reaſon that infants are incapable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating.
But, when his body has nearly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
its full ſize, he requires not the ſame
quantity of organic particles; the ſurplus is,
therefore, ſent from all parts into reſervoirs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined
for their reception. Theſe reſervoirs are
the teſtes and ſeminal veſſels. At this very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
when the growth of the body is nearly
finiſhed, puberty commences, and every phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon
attending it diſcovers a ſuperabundance
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0195400702:54"/>
of nouriſhment: The voice changes into a
deeper tone; the beard begins to appear, and
other parts of the body are covered with hair;
the parts deſtined for generation are ſuddenly
expanded; the ſeminal fluid fills the reſervoirs
prepared for its reception; and, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
it eſcapes from the body during ſleep.
This ſuperabundance is ſtill more evident in the
female: It diſcovers itſelf by a periodic evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which begins and terminates with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of propagating; by a quick increaſe of the
breaſts; and by a change in the ſexual parts,
which ſhall be afterwards explained<note n="*" place="bottom">See below the Nat. Hiſt. of Man, chap. 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>I conceive, then, that the organic particles
ſent from all parts of the body into the teſticles
and ſeminal veſſels of the male, and into the
ovarium of the female, compoſe the ſeminal
fluid, which, in either ſex, as formerly obſerved,
is a kind of extract from the ſeveral parts of the
body. Theſe organic particles, inſtead of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and forming an individual ſimilar to that in
whoſe body they are contained, as happens in
vegetables, and ſome imperfect animals, cannot
accompliſh this end without a mixture of the
fluids of both ſexes. When this mixture is made,
if the organic particles of the male exceed thoſe
of the female, the reſult is a male; and, if thoſe
of the female moſt abound, a female is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
I mean not that the organic particles of
the male or of the female could ſingly produce
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0195400702:55"/>
individuals: A concurrence or union of both is
requiſite to accompliſh this end. Thoſe ſmall
moving bodies, called <hi>ſpermatic animals,</hi> which,
by the aſſiſtance of the microſcope, are ſeen in
the ſeminal fluids of all male animals, are, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
organized ſubſtances proceeding from the
individual which contains them; but, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they are incapable of expanſion, or of
becoming animals ſimilar to thoſe in whom they
exiſt. We ſhall afterwards demonſtrate, that
there are ſimilar animalcules in the ſeminal fluids
of females, and point out the place where this
fluid is to be found.</p>
               <p>It is probable, that theſe organic bodies are
only the firſt rudiments of an animal, containing
nothing but its eſſential parts. We ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a detail of proofs on this ſubject, but
content ourſelves with remarking, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization
of theſe pretended ſpermatic animals
may be very imperfect; or rather, that they
have the living organic particles mentioned above,
which are common both to vegetables and to
animals; or, at moſt, that they are only the firſt
junction of theſe particles.</p>
               <p>But, to return to our ſubject. It may be aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how is it poſſible that the ſuperfluous orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic
particles ſhould be detached from all parts of
the body, and unite upon the mixture of the
male and female fluids? Beſides, are we certain
that ſuch a mixture takes place? Has it not been
mentioned, that the female furniſhes no fluid of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0195400702:56"/>
this kind? Is it an eſtabliſhed fact, that the male
fluid enters the uterus? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To the firſt queſtion I reply, that, if what I
had ſaid concerning the penetration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
mould by the organic particles, in growth
and nutrition, had been properly underſtood, it
would be eaſy to conceive, that, when theſe
particles are unable to penetrate the parts into
which they formerly entered, they muſt take
another rout, and, of courſe, arrive at ſome
other part, as the teſticles and ſeminal veſſels.
Every attempt to explain the animal oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
and the various motions of the human
body, by mechanical principles alone, muſt be
vain and ineffectual; for it is evident, that the
circulation of the blood, muſcular motion, and
other functions of an animated body, cannot be
accounted for by impulſion, or by any of the
common laws of mechaniſm. It is equally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that growth and reproduction are effects
of laws of a different nature. Why, then, do
we refuſe the exiſtence of penetrating forces
which act upon the whole ſubſtances of bodies,
when we have examples of ſuch powers in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
in magnetic attraction, in chemical affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
Since, therefore, we are aſſured by facts,
and by a number of conſtant and uniform ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
that there are powers in nature which
act not by impulſion, why are not theſe powers
ranked among mechanical principles? Why do
we reject them in the explanation of effects
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0195400702:57"/>
which they are known to produce? Why are we
deſirous of employing only the power of impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
Is not this equally abſurd as to judge of
painting by the touch; to explain the phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
that belong to the maſs by thoſe that relate
only to the ſurface; or to uſe one ſenſe in place
of another? It is limiting the reaſoning faculty
to a ſmall number of mechanical principles,
which are by no means ſufficient to explain the
various effects of nature.</p>
               <p>But, if theſe penetrating forces be once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
is it not natural to imagine, that thoſe
par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>es which are moſt analogous to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will unite in the moſt intimate manner; that
each part of the body will appropriate thoſe
which are moſt agreeable to its nature; and that
the whole ſuperfluous particles will form a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
fluid, which ſhall contain all the organic  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
neceſſary for forming a ſmall organized
body, ſimilar in every reſpect to that from which
the fluid is extracted? May not a force, ſimilar
to that which is the cauſe of growth, be ſufficient
to collect the ſuperfluous organic particles, and
beſtow on them the figure of the body from
which they proceed?</p>
               <p>That our food contains an immenſe number
of organic particles, requires no formal proof;
ſince we are ſolely nouriſhed by animals and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
which are organized ſubſtances. In the
ſtomach and inteſtines, the groſs parts of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment
are ſeparated and rejected by the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0195400702:58"/>
The chyle, which is a purer part of
the aliment, is abſorbed by the lacteal veſſels;
from thence it is carried into the maſs of blood,
and, in the courſe of circulation, it is more and
more refined, the unorganic and uſeleſs particles
being thrown out by tranſpiration and other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions:
But the organic particles are retained,
becauſe they are analogous to the blood, and are
attracted by it. Hence, as the whole maſs of
blood paſſes ſeveral times through the body,
during the courſe of this perpetual circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I ſuppoſe, that each particular part attracts
thoſe particles which are moſt analagous to it,
and allows the reſt to move on. In this manner
all the parts are nouriſhed and unfolded, not, as
is commonly imagined, by a ſimple addition of
matter to their furfaces, but by an intimate pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of ſubſtance, effected by a force which
acts equally upon every point of the whole maſs:
And, after the different parts have acquired their
utmoſt growth, and are fully impregnated
with ſimilar organic particles, as their ſubſtance
becomes then more denſe and ſolid, I imagine
that they loſe their faculty of attracting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the particles preſented to them. But, as
the particles continue to be carried round in the
courſe of the circulation, and are no longer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed
in ſuch quantities as formerly, they muſt,
of neceſſity, be depoſited in ſome particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervoir,
ſuch as the teſticles and ſeminal veſſels.
When this fluid extract of the male is mixed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0195400702:59"/>
with that of the female, the particles which are
moſt analogous to each other, being actuated by
a penetrating force, unite and form a ſmall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
body, ſimilar to the one or the other
ſex; and this body, when once formed, requires
only an expanſion of its parts, an operation
which is performed in the womb of the mother.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now conſider the ſecond queſtion,
namely, whether the female has a ſeminal fluid
ſimilar to that of the male? In the <hi>firſt</hi> place,
though ſuch a fluid exiſts in females, the mode of
emiſſion is very different from that of the male,
being generally confined within the body<note n="*" place="bottom">Quod intra ſe ſemen jacit, foemina vocatur; quod in hac <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>acit, mas; <hi>Ariſtot. de animalibus, art.</hi> 18.</note>. The
antients were ſo confident of the exiſtence of a
female fluid, that they diſtinguiſhed the two
ſexes by their different modes of emiſſion. But
thoſe phyſicians who attempt to explain genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by eggs, or by ſpermatic animalcules, inſiſt,
that females have no peculiar fluid; that the
mucus iſſuing from the parts has been miſtaken
for a ſeminal fluid; and that the opinion of the
antients on this ſubject is deſtitute of foundation.
This fluid, however, does exiſt; and the doubts
concerning it have ariſen ſolely from attachment
to ſyſtems, and from the difficulty of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its reſervoir. The fluid which is ſeparated
from the glands about the neck and orifice of the
uterus, has no viſible reſervoir; and, as it flows
out of the body, it is natural to think that it is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0195400702:60"/>
not the prolific fluid, becauſe it cannot co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in the formation of the foetus, which is
performed within the uterus. The reſervoir for the
prolific fluid of the female, therefore, muſt be ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in a different part: It even flows abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
though, like that of the male, a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
is ſufficient to produce a foetus. If a little
of the male fluid enters the uterus, either by its
orifice or by abſorption, and meets with the
ſmalleſt drop of the female fluid, it is ſufficient
for the purpoſe of propagation. Thus, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the obſervations of ſome anatomiſts, who
maintain that the ſeminal fluid of the male can
have no admiſſion into the uterus, nor the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
opinion maintained by their antagoniſts,
have any influence upon the theory we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to eſtabliſh. But the diſcuſſion of
theſe points we leave to a future opportunity.</p>
               <p>Having obviated ſuch objections as might be
made, let us attend to the evidences that concur
in ſupporting our hypotheſis. The firſt ariſes
from the analogy between growth and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.
It is impoſſible to give a ſatisfactory
account of growth or expanſion, without having
recourſe to thoſe penetrating forces, thoſe affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or attractions which we employed in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the formation of the ſmall organic bodies
that are ſimilar to the large bodies which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them. A ſecond analogy is derived from
this circumſtance, that both nutrition and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
proceed, not only from the ſame effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0195400702:61"/>
but from the ſame material cauſe, namely,
the organic particles of food; and what proves
the ſurplus of the nutritive particles to be the
cauſe of reproduction, is, that the body is not in
a condition to propagate till its growth be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Of this we have daily examples, in dogs and
other animals, who follow, more cloſely than
we do, the laws of nature: They have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to propagate till they have nearly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their full growth; and by this we know
whether the growth of a dog be finiſhed; for
he ſeldom grows after being in a condition to
generate.</p>
               <p>Another proof that the ſeminal fluid is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the ſurplus of the nutritive particles, ariſes
from the condition of eunuchs and other muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
animals: In this unnatural ſtate, animals
grow fatter than thoſe who retain all their parts.
The ſuperabundance of nutriment, having no
organs for its evacuation, changes the whole ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of their bodies. The knees and haunches
of eunuchs grow uncommonly large. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is evident. After their bodies have acquired
the common ſize, if the ſuperfluous organic par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
found an iſſue, as in other men, the growth
would proceed no farther. But, as they want
organs for emitting the ſeminal fluid, which is
nothing but the ſuperfluous nutritive particles,
it remains in the body, and has a conſtant ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to expand the parts beyond their natural
ſize. Now, bones, it is well known, grow or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0195400702:62"/>
extend by their extremities, which are ſoft and
ſpongy, and, when they have once acquired ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity,
they are incapable of farther extenſion:
Hence the ſuperfluous organic particles can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enlarge the ſpongy extremities of bones; and
this is the reaſon why the haunches, knees, &amp;c.
of eunuchs augment to a diſproportioned bulk.</p>
               <p>But the ſtrongeſt proof of the truth of our preſent
doctrine ariſes from the reſemblance of children
to their parents. Sons, in general, reſemble their
fathers more than their mothers, and daughters
have a greater reſemblance to their mothers than
their fathers; becauſe, with regard to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
habit of body, a man reſembles a man more
than a woman, and a woman reſembles a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
more than a man. But, as to particular
features or habits, children ſometimes reſemble
the father, ſometimes the mother, and ſometimes
both. A child, for example, will have the eyes
of the father, and the mouth of the mother, or
the colour of the mother and the ſtature of the
father. Of ſuch phaenomena it is impoſſible
to give any explication, unleſs we admit that
both parents have contributed to the formation
of the child, and, conſequently, that there has
been a mixture of two ſeminal fluids.</p>
               <p>Theſe reſemblances long embarraſſed me, and,
till I had maturely conſidered the ſubject of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
led me into many errors and prejudices:
And it was not without much thought, a minute
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0195400702:63"/>
examination of a great number of families, and a
multiplicity of evidence, that I could prevail on
myſelf to alter my former opinion, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
what I now believe to be truth. But the
objections which might occur concerning mulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes,
mongrels, mules, and particular parental
reſemblances, inſtead of oppoſing my theory,
I deſpair not of being able to ſhow that they
ſtrengthen and confirm it.</p>
               <p>In youth, the ſeminal fluid is leſs copious, but
more ſtimulating. Its quantity continues to
augment till a certain age; becauſe, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as we approach that age, the parts of the
body become more ſolid, admit fewer nutritive
particles, ſend back more of them to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reſervoirs, and, of courſe, augment the
quantity of the ſeminal fluid. Thus, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
organs have not been uſed, middle-aged
men, or even old men, procreate with more eaſe
than young men. This is evidently the caſe
with the vegetable tribes: A tree, the older it is,
produces the greater quantity of fruit.</p>
               <p>Young people, who, by forced irritations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
an unnatural quantity of this fluid into
the reſervoirs prepared for its reception, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ceaſe to grow, loſe their fleſh, and at laſt
fall into conſumptions. The reaſon is apparent:
They loſe, by premature and too frequent eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations,
the very ſubſtance which nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the nouriſhment and growth of their
bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0195400702:64"/>
Men who are thin, but not emaciated, and
thoſe who are plump, but not fat, are the moſt
vigorous. Whenever the ſuperabundant nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
particles begin to form fat, it is always at
the expence of the ſeminal fluid and other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative
powers. When the growth of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts of the body is compleat, when the
bones have acquired full ſolidity, when the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages
begin to oſſify, and, laſtly, when the parts
almoſt refuſe the admiſſion of nutritive particles,
then the fat augments conſiderably, and the
quantity of ſeminal fluid diminiſhes; becauſe
the nutritive particles, inſtead of being ſent back
to the reſervoirs, are arreſted in every part of
the body.</p>
               <p>The quantity of ſeminal fluid not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
till we arrive at a certain age, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more thick. It contains, in the ſame
bounds, a greater quantity of matter. Its
ſpecific gravity is nearly double that of the
blood; and, of courſe, it is heavier than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
animal fluid.</p>
               <p>To a man in health, an evacuation of this
fluid whets the appetite: He ſoon finds the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of repairing the loſs by freſh nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Hence we may conclude, that abſtinence
and hunger are the moſt effectual checks to lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury
of every kind.</p>
               <p>Many other remarks might be made on this
ſubject, which muſt be deferred till we come to
treat of the hiſtory of man: We ſhall, therefore,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0195400702:65"/>
conclude with a few obſervations. Moſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
diſcover no inclination for the ſexes till
their growth be nearly finiſhed: Thoſe which
have but one ſeaſon in the year, have no ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
fluid excepting at that time. Mr Needham<note n="*" place="bottom">See Needh. new microſcopical diſcoveries, London 1745.</note>
not only ſaw this liquor forming in the milt of
the <hi>Calmar,</hi> but likewiſe the ſpermatic animals,
and the milt itſelf, which have no exiſtence till
the month of October, when this fiſh ſpawns on
the coaſts of Portugal, where Needham made
the obſervation. After the ſpawning time is
over, the ſeminal liquor, the ſpermatic animals,
and the milt, dry up and totally diſappear; till
the ſame ſeaſon returns next year, when the
ſuperfluous nutritive particles renew the milt as
formerly. The hiſtory of the deer will furniſh
us with an opportunity of remarking the various
effects of rutting, the moſt conſpicuous of which
is the extenuation of the animal; and, in thoſe
ſpecies of animals whoſe rutting or ſpawning
happens but once in a year, the extenuation of
their bodies is proportionally great.</p>
               <p>As women are ſmaller and weaker than men,
as their conſtitutions are more delicate, and, as
they take leſs food, it is natural to think that
their ſuperfluous organic particles ſhould alſo
be leſs abundant: Of courſe, their ſeminal fluid
will be weaker and ſmaller in quantity than that
of men; and, ſince the fluid of females contains
fewer organic particles, muſt not a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0195400702:66"/>
of males than of females reſult from a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of theſe two fluids? This is really the caſe;
and to account for it has hitherto been deemed
impoſſible. The number of males born exceeds
that of females about a ſixteenth part; and we
ſhall afterwards ſee that the ſame effect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the ſame cauſe in all the different ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of animals.</p>

               <head>Examination of the different Syſtems of Generation.</head>
               <p>PLATO, in the Timaeus, accounts not only
for the generation of men, of animals, of
plants, and of the elements, but even of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and of the gods themſelves, by images
reflected or extracted from the divine Creator;
which images, by an harmonic movement, are
arranged in the moſt perfect order, according to
the properties of number. The univerſe, he
ſays, is a copy of the Deity; time, ſpace, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and matter, are the images or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his attributes; and ſecondary and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
cauſes are reſults of the numeric and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic
qualities of theſe images: The world,
from its excellency, is the moſt perfect animated
being. To give the world complete perfection,
it was neceſſary that it ſhould contain all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
animals, or all the poſſible forms and
repreſentations of the creative power. Man is
one of theſe forms. The eſſence of all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
conſiſts in the unity and harmony of the
number Three, or of the Triangle, namely, that
which generates, that in which generation is
performed, and the reſult, or that which is
generated. The ſucceſſion of individuals in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0195400702:68"/>
ſpecies, is only a fugitive image of the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
eternity of this harmonic triangle, a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
prototype of all exiſtences, and of all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
               <p>This philoſopher paints only ideas. Diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
from matter, he flies into the regions of
abſtraction; and, loſing ſight of ſenſible objects,
he contemplates thoſe of intellect alone. One
cauſe, one end, one mean, compoſe the whole
of his perceptions: God is the cauſe, perfection
the end, and harmonic repreſentations the means.
This idea is ſublime; the mode of philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
is noble and full of ſimplicity; but it is
perfectly vacant, and affords no objects for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.
We are not pure intelligences. We
are unable to give real exiſtence to our ideas.
Chained to matter, or rather depending on the
cauſes of our ſenſations, it is impoſſible that we
ſhould realiſe abſtractions. To Plato I might
reply in his own manner, 'The Creator realiſes
every thing he conceives; his perceptions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
exiſtence: The created being, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
conceives nothing but by retrenching
from reality; and annihilation is neceſſary to
bring forth his ideas.'</p>
               <p>Let us, without regret, therefore, confine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to a philoſophy more humble and more
material; and, keeping within the ſphere which
nature has allotted us, let us examine thoſe rapid
and daring ſpirits who attempt, though in vain,
to fly beyond the limits of humanity. The whole
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0195400702:69"/>
of this Pythagorean philoſophy, which is purely
intellectual, depends upon two principles, the
one falſe, and the other uncertain; namely, the
real power of abſtraction, and the natural exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of final cauſes. To apprehend numbers to
be real beings; to ſay that unity is a general
individual, which not only repreſents all indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals,
but even communicates exiſtence to them;
to pretend that unity exerciſes the actual power
of engendering another unity nearly reſembling
itſelf, and of creating two individuals, two ſides
of a triangle, that can have no connection or
perfection without a third ſide, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
produced by the other two; in fine, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
numbers, geometrical lines, and metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
abſtractions, as real and efficient phyſical
cauſes, by which the elements are formed, plants
and animals regenerated, and all the phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
of nature produced, appears to be the
greateſt and moſt abſurd abuſe of human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and an invincible obſtacle to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of knowledge. Beſides, nothing can be
more fallacious than ſuch chimeras. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
we ſhould agree with Plato and Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche,
that matter has no exiſtence, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
objects are only ideal images of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power, and that we ſee every thing in the
Deity himſelf; does it follow, that our ideas are
of the ſame order with thoſe of the Creator, and
that they can produce real exiſtences? Are we
not dependent on our ſenſations? Whether the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0195400702:70"/>
objects which excite ſenſations be real or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
whether they exiſt without or within, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be God or matter that we every where
behold, is to us of little importance: We are
not leſs certain of being uniformly affected in
the ſame manner by the ſame cauſes. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
between our ſenſes and the objects which
affect them, are neceſſary and invariable. It is
upon this baſis alone that the principles of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
ought to be founded, otherwiſe our
knowledge muſt be uſeleſs and fallacious. Can
an harmonic triangle create the ſubſtance of the
elements? Is fire, as Plato affirms, an acute tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,
and light and heat two properties of this
triangle? Are water and air rectangular and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilateral
triangles? Is the form of the element
of earth a ſquare, becauſe, being the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the four elements, it recedes as far as
poſſible from a triangle, without departing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
from its eſſence? Do males and females
embrace each other, for no other purpoſe but to
complete the triangle of generation? Theſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonic
ideas have two different aſpects: In ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
they ſeem to proceed from ſublime
principles; but the application of them in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
leads to nothing but falſe and childiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
               <p>Is it difficult to perceive that our ideas origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
from our ſenſes alone; that the objects we
regard as real exiſtences, are thoſe concerning
which the ſenſes uniformly give the ſame teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0195400702:71"/>
that the objects we apprehend as having
a real exiſtence, are thoſe which are invariably
preſented to us in the ſame manner; that the
mode in which they preſent themſelves has no
dependence upon our will or inclination; that,
of courſe, our ideas, inſtead of being the cauſes
of things, are only particular effects, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
leſs ſimilar to the objects themſelves, in
proportion as they are rendered more general;
and, laſtly, that mental abſtractions are only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
beings, which derive their intellectual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
from the faculty we poſſeſs of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
objects, without regarding their ſenſible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</p>
               <p>Is it not, therefore, apparent, that abſtract i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
can never be the principles of exiſtence, or
of real knowledge? On the contrary, all our
knowledge is derived from comparing and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging
the reſults of our ſenſations. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
are known by the appellation of <hi>experience,</hi>
the only ſource of genuine ſcience. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of any other principle is an abuſe; and
every edifice founded upon abſtract ideas, is a
temple erected to Error.</p>
               <p>In philoſophy, error has a more extenſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
than in morals. A thing may be falſe
in morals ſolely becauſe it is miſrepreſented. But
falſehood in metaphyſics conſiſts not in miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
alone, but in taking for granted what
has no exiſtence at all. It is into this moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
ſpecies of error that the Platoniſts and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0195400702:72"/>
the Sceptics have fallen. Their falſe ſuppoſitions
have obſcured the natural light of truth, bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the reaſoning faculties of men, and retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the progreſs of philoſophy.</p>
               <p>Final cauſes are employed as a ſecond prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
by Plato and other theoriſts. This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
has even been adopted by the vulgar, and
by ſome modern philoſophers. A moment's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
however, will be ſufficient to reduce
this principle to its proper value. To ſay that
light exiſts becauſe we have eyes, and that ſounds
exiſt becauſe we have ears; or to ſay that we
have eyes and ears, becauſe light and ſounds
exiſt; is not this preciſely the ſame thing? or,
rather, are we any wiſer by this kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Will we ever make any diſcoveries by ſuch
a mode of explication? Is it not apparent, that
final cauſes are only arbitrary relations and
moral abſtractions, which ought to have leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
than abſtractions in metaphyſics, becauſe
the origin of the former is leſs noble and worſe
imagined? And, though Leibnitz has endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to give an elevation to final cauſes, under the
appellation of the reaſonableneſs and eternal fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of things, [<hi>raiſon ſuffiſante</hi>], and Plato has
repreſented them under the flattering picture of
abſolute perfection; all theſe efforts are inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to cover their native inſignificance and
precariouſneſs. Are we better inſtructed in the
operations of Nature, becauſe we are told that
nothing exiſts without a reaſon, or that every

thing is created with a view to the perfection of
the whole? What is reaſonableneſs or fitneſs?
What is perfection? Are they not moral beings,
created ſolely by the human intellect? Are they
not arbitrary relations which we have contrived
to generaliſe? They have no foundation but in
moral affinities, which, ſo far from producing
any phyſical or real exiſtence, change the nature
of truth, and confound the objects of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
of our perceptions, and of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
with thoſe of our ſentiments, of our

                     <p>The tranſlator thinks it his duty to apprize the reader, that here, as well as in ſeveral other parts of this work, the author makes an ingenious and plauſible attack againſt the exiſtence and utility of final cauſes. Every philoſopher will admit the abſurdity of employing a final cauſe as a phyſical principle. M. de Buffon, if he meant only to expoſe the miſapplication of final cauſes, had no occaſion to betray ſo much warmth and anxiety about an object ſo apparent. But, like too many of our modern French writers, he ſeems to be ignorant of, or rather intentionally neglects, the diſtinction between final and phyſical cauſes. Final cauſes regard the deſign or the utility of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar objects, whether that utility relates to man, to the objects themſelves, or to the general ſtructure of the univerſe. But phyſical cauſes are limited to the explanation of particular ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or modes of exiſtence. <hi>Why</hi> were mountains, ſeas, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, created? <hi>What</hi> uſeful purpoſes do they ſerve? For the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of theſe, and ſimilar queſtions, final cauſes can alone be employed. But if it be aſked, <hi>How</hi> were mountains and ſeas formed? <hi>How</hi> were inſects originally produced; and <hi>how</hi> are their different ſpecies propagated? Theſe are queſtions purely phyſical, and ſo different in their nature from the former, that nothing but ſtupidity, or worſe motives, could poſſibly confound them.</p>
                     <p>It may be farther remarked, that final cauſes are the greateſt ſtumbling-blocks which lie in the way of atheiſts and materialiſts. They, accordingly, ſtrain every nerve to remove them. But their force is ſo irreſiſtible; their numbers are ſo immenſe; their beauties are ſo ſtriking, and correſpond ſo intimately with the warm and benevolent feelings of the heart; the concatenation and mutual dependence of all created beings recogniſable by our ſenſes are ſo apparent, and ſo illuſtrious, that no powers of ſophiſtry, no artful miſrepreſentations, no ſtrokes of ridicule, will ever be able to diminiſh their influence, or weaken the force of thoſe ſentiments which the Supreme Being intended they ſhould excite in the breaſts of his intelligent creatures. Final cauſes not only demonſtrate the exiſtence of a Supreme Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Power, but the infinite beneficence, and minute attention of that Power to the happineſs of thoſe beings upon whom He has thought proper to confer exiſtence.</p>

Much more might be ſaid upon this ſubject.
But I pretend not to write a treatiſe on philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy;
and ſhall therefore return to phyſics,
from which the ideas of Plato, concerning uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
generation, have diverted my attention.
Ariſtotle, who was as great a philoſopher as
Plato, and a better phyſician, inſtead of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
in the regions of theory, collects facts,
and ſpeaks in a language more intelligible.</p>
               <p>Matter, he remarks, which is only a capacity
of receiving forms, aſſumes, in generation, a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
ſimilar to the individual which furniſhes it:
And, with regard to animals which generate by
the intervention of ſexes, he imagines, that the
prolific principle proceeds ſolely from the male<note n="*" place="bottom">See Ariſtot. de Gen. lib. 1. cap. 20. and lib. 2. cap. 4.</note>:
For though, in another place, when ſpeaking of
animals in general, he ſays, that the female
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0195400702:75"/>
ſheds a ſeminal fluid within the body, it appears,
that he regards not this fluid as a prolific prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
and yet he tells us, that the menſtrual
blood ſerves for the formation, nouriſhment,
and growth of the foetus; but that the efficient
principle exiſts alone in the ſeminal fluid of
the male, which acts not as matter, but as a cauſe.
Averrhoes, Avicenna, and other philoſophers who
embraced this opinion of Ariſtotle, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to prove that females have no prolific
fluid. They alledge, that, as females are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with a menſtrual fluid, which is both
neceſſary and ſufficient for the purpoſes of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
it is unnatural to ſuppoſe them poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of any other, eſpecially ſince it begins to
appear, like that of the male, at the age of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Beſides, they continue, if females really
have a prolific ſeminal fluid, why do they not
produce without the intercourſe of the male,
ſince they contain the prolific principle, as well
as the matter neceſſary for the growth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion
of the embryo? This laſt reaſon is the
only one which merits attention. The men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual
blood appears to be neceſſary for the
growth and nouriſhment of the foetus; but ſtill
it may contribute nothing to its firſt formation,
which requires the mixture of both prolific
fluids. Females, therefore, like males, may have
a prolific fluid for the formation of the embryo,
as well as menſtrual blood for its growth and
nouriſhment. The imagination is not unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0195400702:76"/>
that, as the female poſſeſſes both a prolific
fluid extracted from all parts of her body, and
likewiſe the means of expanding and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe ſhould produce females without any
communication with the male. It muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that this metaphyſical argument uſed by
the Ariſtotelians for proving that females are
deſtitute of a prolific fluid, may be urged as the
ſtrongeſt argument againſt every ſyſtem of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
and, in particular, againſt that which
I am endeavouring to eſtabliſh.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe, it may be ſaid, that the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
organic particles are ſent from every part
of the body into the teſticles and ſeminal veſſels
of the male, why do they not, by means of your
imaginary attracting forces, form ſmall organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
bodies ſimilar to the whole? Why are not
ſimilar bodies generated in the female, without
any intercourſe with the male? If you anſwer,
that the male fluid contains only males, that the
female fluid contains only females, that both pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
for want of the circumſtances neceſſary for
expanſion, and that, for the procreation of an
animal, a mixture of both is requiſite; may it
not be demanded, why this moſt complicated,
difficult, and leſs fertile mode of generation, is ſo
invariably preferred by Nature, that all animals,
with a few trifling exceptions, generate by the
mutual commerce of ſexes?</p>
               <p>I ſhall content myſelf, at preſent, with reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that this is the mode actually employed by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0195400702:77"/>
Nature; and, therefore, however complicated it
may appear, it is, in fact, the moſt ſimple; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as I formerly remarked, whatever moſt
frequently happens, is, in itſelf, however it may
ſeems to us, the moſt ſimple.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the notion of the Ariſtotelians, that
females have no ſeminal fluid, cannot receive our
aſſent, if we conſider the ſtrong reſemblance of
children to their mothers, and that mules, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lattoes,
and mongrels of every kind, uniformly
reſemble the mother more than the father; and,
if it be farther conſidered, that the generating
organs of the female, like thoſe of the male, are
properly formed for preparing and receiving a
ſeminal fluid, we ſhall be eaſily induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the exiſtence of ſuch a fluid, whether it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
in the ſpermatic veſſels, the teſticles, or the
ovaria, or proceeds, by irritation, from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunae
of De Graaf, which are ſituated at the neck
and near the orifice of the uterus.</p>
               <p>But we muſt examine Ariſtotle's ideas more
fully, as, of all the antients, this great philoſopher
has treated the ſubject of generation in the moſt
extenſive manner. He diſtinguiſhes animals
into three claſſes: 1. Thoſe that have blood,
and, with few exceptions, propagate by copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
2. Thoſe that have no blood, and, being
hermaphrodites, produce of themſelves without
copulation; and, 3. Thoſe that proceed from
putrefaction, and have no parents of any kind.
I ſhall firſt remark, that this diviſion is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0195400702:78"/>
improper: Though it be true, that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
having blood are diſtinguiſhed into male
and female, it is by no means equally true, that
bloodleſs animals are, for the moſt part, herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodites:
For the only hermaphrodites we
know, are land-ſnails and worms; but we are
uncertain whether all ſhell-animals, and all thoſe
which have no blood, be alſo hermaphrodites. This
muſt be learned from the particular hiſtories of
theſe animals. And, with regard to thoſe that
are alledged to proceed from putrefaction, as Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle
gives no enumeration of them, many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
occur; for moſt ſpecies which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
believed to proceed from putrefaction,
have, by the moderns, been diſcovered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from eggs.</p>
               <p>Ariſtotle makes a ſecond diviſion of animals,
namely, into thoſe who have the faculty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive
motion, and thoſe who have no ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
All animals who move, and have blood,
are diſtinguiſhed by ſexes: But thoſe which,
like oyſters, adhere to one place, or hardly move
at all, have no ſexes, and, in this reſpect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
plants; and it is only, he obſerves, from
difference in bulk that they have been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
into male and female. It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that we are ſtill uncertain whether
ſhell-animals have ſexes: Among oyſters, ſome
individuals are fertile, and others not. The fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
individuals are diſtinguiſhed by a delicate
edging or border which ſurround their bodies,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0195400702:79"/>
and they are called males<note n="*" place="bottom">See Deſlandes dans ſon traité de la marine. Paris 1747.</note>. Our obſervations
on this ſubject are extremely limited.</p>
               <p>But to proceed. The male, according to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,
contains the principle of motion, and
the female the material part of generation. The
organs deſtined for this purpoſe are different in
different animals. Of theſe the teſticles are the
chief in males, and the uterus in females. Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds,
birds, and cetaceous animals, have teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;
fiſhes and ſerpents are deprived of them;
but they have two canals for the reception and
maturation of the ſemen: Theſe parts, ſo eſſential
to generation, are always double both in males
and females; and, in the male, they retard the
motion of that part of the blood which goes to
the formation of ſemen. This he proves from
the example of birds whoſe teſticles ſwell conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
during the ſeaſon of their amours, but
afterwards diminiſh ſo greatly that they can
hardly be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>All quadrupeds covered with hair, and the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taceous
fiſhes, as whales and dolphins, are vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous:
But vipers and cartilagious animals are
not properly viviparous; becauſe they produce
an egg within their own bodies, previous to the
excluſion of the live animal. Oviparous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
are of two kinds; thoſe which produce
perfect eggs, as birds, lizards, turtles, &amp;c.
and thoſe which produce imperfect eggs, as
fiſhes, whoſe eggs augment and come to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0195400702:80"/>
after they have been depoſited in the water
by the female: And, in every ſpecies of ovipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
animals, except birds, the females are larger
than the males, as in fiſhes, lizards, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After remarking theſe general varieties in the
animal kingdom, Ariſtotle begins with exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the opinion of the antient philoſophers, that
the ſemen, both of the male and the female, was
extracted from all parts of the body; and he
diſſents from this opinion; becauſe, ſays he,
though children often reſemble both father and
mother, they ſometimes alſo reſemble their grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.
Beſides, they reſemble their fathers and
mothers in the voice, in the hair, in the nails,
and in the gate and manner of walking. Now,
he proceeds, it is impoſſible for the ſemen to
come from the hair, from the voice, from the
nails, or from any external quality, as that of
the mode of walking. Infants, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
not their parents, becauſe the ſemen
proceeds from all parts of the body, but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſons. I will not expoſe the weakneſs of
theſe arguments; but ſhall only remark, that this
great man appears to have been anxious to differ
from the ſentiments of former philoſophers: And
I am perſuaded, that, whoever peruſes his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
on generation, will diſcover, that a ſtrong
paſſion for eſtabliſhing a ſyſtem different from
that of the antients, obliges him uniformly to
prefer arguments of little probability, to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0195400702:81"/>
force of proofs, when they ſtand in oppoſition
to the general principles of his philoſophy.</p>
               <p>The ſeminal liquor of the male, according to
Ariſtotle, is ſecreted from the blood; and the
menſtrual fluid of the female is likewiſe a ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the blood, and the only matter which
contributes to generation. Females, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
have no other prolific fluid; no mixture,
therefore, of male and female fluid takes place:
This he attempts to prove by obſerving, that
ſome women conceive without pleaſure; that
few emit any fluid during the time of copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that, in general, thoſe who are brown, and
have a maſculine air, have no emiſſion; and yet
their powers of procreation are not leſs than
thoſe of a fairer complection and more delicate
appearance, who emit copiouſly. Thus, he
concludes, women furniſh nothing for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of generation, but the menſtrual blood.
This blood is the matter of generation, and the
male fluid contributes nothing but the form:
The male fluid is the efficient cauſe, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of motion; it is to generation what the
ſculptor is to a block of marble: The ſeminal
fluid is the ſculptor, the menſtrual blood the
marble, and the foetus the figure. The men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual
blood receives from the male ſemen a kind
of ſoul, which gives it life and motion. This
ſoul is neither material nor immaterial, becauſe
it can neither act upon matter, nor augment the
menſtrual blood, which is the only matter neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0195400702:82"/>
to generation. It is a ſpirit, ſays our phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
ſimilar to that of the element of the
ſtars. The heart is the firſt production of this
ſoul, which is the cauſe of its own growth, and
of the growth and diſpoſition of all the other
members. The menſtrual blood contains the
<hi>capacities</hi> of all the parts of the foetus; the ſoul
or ſpirit of the male ſemen makes the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to <hi>act,</hi> and communicates to it the powers of
beſtowing <hi>action</hi> on the other viſcera; and, in
this manner, the different parts of the animal are
ſucceſſively unfolded. All this appears clear and
luminous to our philoſopher. He has only one
doubt, namely, whether the blood or the heart
is firſt realized. And of this he doubted not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reaſon; for, though he adopted the opinion
that the heart received its exiſtence firſt, Harvey
has ſince alledged, from arguments ſimilar to
thoſe of Ariſtotle, that the blood, and not the
heart, is firſt realized.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given a ſhort view of what A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle
has delivered on the ſubject of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſhall leave the reader to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any ſyſtem of the antients be more obſcure,
or more abſurd, than that which he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to eſtabliſh. His ſyſtem, however, has
been adopted by moſt men of learning. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
has borrowed many of Ariſtotle's notions;
but he has alſo adopted ſome of his own, which
are by no means better founded. It is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
that Ariſtotle's theory of generation,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0195400702:83"/>
which was a reſult of his ſyſtem of philoſophy,
where form and matter are the great principles,
where vegetable and ſenſitive ſouls are the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
of nature, and where final cauſes are real
objects, ſhould have been received in the ſchools:
But it is not a little aſtoniſhing to ſee a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
and an acute obſerver, like Harvey, carried
down the ſtream, while, at the ſame time, moſt
philoſophers followed the ſentiments of Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
and Galen, which we ſhall afterwards
take notice of.</p>
               <p>We mean not to convey a diſadvantageous
idea of Ariſtotle by the account we have given
of his theory of generation. We might, with
equal propriety, judge of Deſcartes by his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
on man. What theſe two philoſophers
have remarked concerning the formation of the
foetus ſhould rather be conſidered in the light
of detached obſervations, or as conſequences
which each of them drew from their principles
of philoſophy, than as compleat ſyſtems. Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle
admits, with Plato, final and efficient cauſes:
The latter are the ſenſitive and vegetable ſouls,
that give form to matter, which, in itſelf, is only
a <hi>capacity</hi> of receiving forms: And as, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
the female furniſhes the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of matter, and as it was repugnant to his
ſyſtem of final cauſes, that any effect ſhould be
produced by two cauſes, when one was ſufficient
for the purpoſe, he concludes, that the woman
alone contains the matter neceſſary for procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0195400702:84"/>
Again, another of his principles was, that
matter, in itſelf, has no form, and that <hi>form</hi> is
a being diſtinct from matter; he therefore main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
that the male furniſhes the form, and, of
courſe, that he contributes nothing <hi>material.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Deſcartes, on the contrary, admitted into his
philoſophy only a few mechanical principles.
By theſe he attempted to explain the formation
of the foetus; and he imagined, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
and was able to communicate to others,
the manner in which a living organized body
could be formed by the laws of motion alone.
The principles he employed were different from
thoſe of Ariſtotle. But both of them, inſtead
of directing their inquiries to the thing itſelf, in
place of examining it with impartiality, only
conſidered it in relation to their philoſophic prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which could never be applied with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to the nature of generation, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
as has been already ſhown, upon very
different principles. Deſcartes, however, admits
the exiſtence and neceſſary concurrence of the
ſeminal fluids of both ſexes. He allows that both
furniſh ſomething material for the purpoſes of
generation; and that the fermentation occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a mixture of the two fluids, is the cauſe of
the formation of the foetus.</p>
               <p>Hippocrates, who lived about five or ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years before Ariſtotle, taught an opinion,
which was adopted by Galen, and by moſt phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
for many ages. He maintained the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0195400702:85"/>
of a female fluid; and even that both
male and female had two fluids, the one ſtrong
and active, the other weaker and more inactive<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hippocrat. lib. de Genitura, p. 129, et lib. de Diacta. p. 198. Lugd. Bat. tom. 1. 1665.</note>.
A concurrence of the two ſtronger fluids produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a male child, and, of the two weaker, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.
Thus, according to Hippocrates, there
exiſt two kinds of ſeminal fluids both in the male
and in the female. This notion he ſupports in
the following manner: Several women, who
produced only girls by their firſt huſband, have
had boys by their ſecond; and the ſame thing
has often happened to men who have had two
wives. Suppoſing this to be fact, it admits of
an eaſy explanation, without having recourſe to
two different fluids peculiar to each ſex; for the
women who had girls only by the firſt huſband,
and boys by the ſecond, furniſhed a greater
quantity of particles proper for generation du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the firſt, than the ſecond marriage; or the
ſecond huſband furniſhed a greater quantity of
generating particles during the time of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
marriage, than the firſt. If, at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of conception, the organic particles of the
male are more abundant than thoſe of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
a male child is the reſult; and, when the
organic particles of the female moſt abound, a
female child is the conſequence: It is not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſurpriſing, that the huſband ſhould be foil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſome women, and have the ſuperiority
over others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0195400702:86"/>
It is farther alledged by Hippocrates, that the
male ſemen is ſecreted from the ſtrongeſt and
moſt eſſential fluids of the body; and he thus
explains the manner in which the ſecretion is
performed: 'Venae et nervi,' ſays he, 'ab omni
corpore in pudendum vergunt, quibus dum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantulum
teruntur, et caleſcunt ac implentur,
velut pruritus incidit, ex hoc toti corpori volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
ac caliditas accidit; quum vero pudendum
teritur et homo movetur, humidum in corpore
caleſcit ac diſſunditur, et a motu conquaſſatur ac
ſpumeſcit, quemadmodum alii humores omnes
conquaſſati ſpumeſcunt.'</p>
               <p>'Sic autem in homine ab humido ſpumeſcente
id quod robuſtiſſimum eſt ac pinguiſſimum ſecer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur,
et ad medullam ſpinalem venit; tendunt
enim in hanc ex omni corpore viae, et diſſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt
ex cerebro in lumbos ac in totum corpus
et in medullam: Et ex ipſa medulla procedunt
viae, ut et ad ipſam humidum perferatur et ex
ipſa ſecedat; poſtquam autem ad hanc medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam
genitura pervenerit, procedit ad renes, ac
enim via tendit per venas; et ſi renes fuerint
exulcerati, aliquando etiam ſanguis defertur: A
renibus autem tranſit per medios teſtes in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum,
procedit autem non qua urina, verum
alia ipſi via eſt illi contigua<note n="*" place="bottom">See Fefius's tranſlation, tom. 1. p. 129.</note>,' &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It will, doubtleſs, be perceived by anatomiſts,
that Hippocrates errs in tracing the route of the
ſeminal fluid. But this affects not his hypotheſis,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0195400702:87"/>
that the ſemen proceeds from every part of the
body, and particularly from the head; becauſe,
he remarks, thoſe who have had the veins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
their ears cut, ſecrete only a weak and often
an unfertile ſemen. The female likewiſe ſheds
a ſeminal fluid ſometimes within the uterus, and
ſometimes without, when the orifice is too open.
The male ſemen enters the uterus and mixes
with that of the female; and, as each has two
ſpecies of fluid, the one ſtrong and the other
weak, if both of them furniſh the ſtrong kind,
a male foetus is the conſequence; and, if both
furniſh only the weak kind, the reſult is a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male:
Beſides, if in the mixture there are more
particles of the male than of the female fluid,
the child will reſemble the father more than the
mother; <hi>et c contra.</hi> Here we might aſk him,
what would happen, when the fluid of the one
was ſtrong, and that of the other weak? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive what reply could be made to this
queſtion; and, therefore, we are warranted to
reject the opinion of two diſtinct fluids in each
ſex as perfectly chimerical.</p>
               <p>Let us now attend to his account of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the foetus. The ſeminal fluids firſt
mix in the uterus, and gradually thicken by the
heat of the mother. The mixture extracts the
ſpirit of heat, and when too warm, part of the
heat eſcapes into the air. But a cold ſpirit is
likewiſe conveyed to it by the reſpiration of the
mother: Thus a cold and a hot ſpirit alternately
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0195400702:88"/>
enter the mixture, give life to it, and cover its
ſurface with a pellicle, which aſſumes a round
figure, becauſe the ſpirits acting in the center,
expand the matter equally on all ſides. I have
ſeen, ſays this great phyſician, a foetus of ſix
days old: It was a ball of liquor incloſed in a
pellicle. The liquor was reddiſh; and the
pellicle was interſperſed with red and colourleſs
veſſels. In the middle of it there was a ſmall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
which I apprehended to be the umbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
veſſels, by which the foetus receives nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
and the ſpirit of reſpiration from the
mother. A ſecond covering or pellicle gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
forms above the firſt. Abundance of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
is furniſhed by the menſtrual blood,
which coagulates by degrees, and is converted
into fleſh. This fleſh gradually articulates as it
grows; and the ſpirit beſtows this form upon
it. Every part proceeds to take its proper place;
the ſolid particles unite together; the moiſt
particles aſſociate by themſelves; every thing
ſearches for what is analogous to it; and, in
fine, the foetus, by theſe cauſes and means, is
completely formed.</p>
               <p>This ſyſtem is more rational, and leſs obſcure
than that of Ariſtotle; becauſe Hippocrates en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to explain every particular appearance,
and borrows only one general principle from
the philoſophy of his times, namely, that heat
and cold produce ſpirits, and that theſe ſpirits
have the power of arranging and of beſtowing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0195400702:89"/>
figure upon matter. He treats his ſubject more
like a phyſician than a philoſopher; but Ariſtotle
explains the phaenomena of generation more as
a metaphyſician than a naturaliſt. It is for this
reaſon that the errors of Hippocrates are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and leſs apparent, and that thoſe of Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle
are general and evident.</p>
               <p>Theſe two great men have each had their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
Almoſt all the philoſophers of the
ſchools adopted Ariſtotle's theory of generation,
while moſt phyſicians adhered to the theory of
Hippocrates; and, in this manner, 17 or 18 cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies
paſſed without the appearance of any thing
new upon this myſterious ſubject.</p>
               <p>At laſt, upon the revival of literature, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts
began to inveſtigate the nature of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and Fabricius ab Aquapendente was the
firſt who thought of making a courſe of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the impregnation and expanſion of
the eggs of fowls, the ſubſtance of which we
ſhall lay before the reader.</p>
               <p>He diſtinguiſhes the matrix of a hen into
two parts, the one ſuperior, and the other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior.
The ſuperior part, which he calls the
ovarium, is an aſſemblage of a great number of
ſmall yellow eggs, of a round figure, the ſizes
of which vary from that of a muſtard ſeed to
that of a walnut. Theſe eggs are attached to
one another by foot-ſtalks, and the whole ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
reſembles a bunch of grapes. The ſmalleſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0195400702:90"/>
eggs are white, and they turn yellower in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as they increaſe.</p>
               <p>Having examined thoſe yellow eggs imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after a communication with the male, he
could perceive no ſenſible difference; he ſaw
none of the male ſemen in any part of the eggs:
He therefore concluded, that the whole eggs,
and even the ovarium itſelf, were rendered fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
by a ſubtile ſpirit which iſſues from the male
ſemen; and, he adds, that, in order to prevent
the eſcape of this fecundating ſpirit, nature has
placed, at the external orifice of the vagina of
birds, a membranous valve which permits the
ſeminal ſpirit to enter freely into the vagina,
but prevents its return.</p>
               <p>When an egg is detached from the common
pedicle, it gradually deſcends, through a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
canal, into the inferior part of the matrix.
This canal is filled with a liquor very ſimilar to
the white of an egg. It is here that the egg
receives its white liquor, the membrane in which
it is incloſed, the two cords (<hi>chalazae</hi>) that run
through the white, and join it to the yolk, and
the ſhell which is ſuddenly formed immediately
before excluſion. Theſe cords, according to
our author, are the part of the egg which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
by the ſeminal ſpirit of the male; and
it is here alſo that the rudiments of the foetus
firſt appear. The egg is not only the true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,
or the place where the chick is formed, but
the whole buſineſs of generation depends upon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0195400702:91"/>
it. The egg is the great agent in generation;
it furniſhes both the matter and the organs.
The ſubſtance of the cords is the matter of
which the chick is formed; the white and the
yok afford it nouriſhment; and the ſeminal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the male is the efficient cauſe. This ſpirit
communicates to the cords, firſt, an alterant
quality, then a forming quality, and, laſtly, a
power of augmenting, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations of Fabricius, it is apparent,
lead not to any clear idea of generation. At the
ſame time that this anatomiſt was making his
experiments, which was about the middle of the
ſixteenth century, the famous Aldrovandus<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Ornithologia.</note>
made ſome remarks upon eggs. But, as Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
properly obſerves of him, he followed more
the authority of Ariſtotle than of experiment.
The deſcription he gives of the chick in the egg
is by no means exact. Volcher Coiter, one of
his pupils, ſucceeded better than his maſter; this
writer, together with Pariſanus, a Venetian phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
have each given deſcriptions of the chick
in the egg, which Harvey prefers to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>This celebrated anatomiſt, who firſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the circulation of the blood, has given an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
treatiſe on generation. He flouriſhed
about the middle of laſt century, and was phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
to Charles I. of England. As he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to follow this unhappy Prince during his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0195400702:92"/>
misfortunes, he loſt, among other papers, what
he had written concerning the generation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects;
and it appears, that he compoſed from
memory his treatiſe on the generation of birds
and of quadrupeds. I ſhall give a ſhort view of
his remarks, of his experiments, and of his the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory.</p>
               <p>Harvey alledges, that men, and all other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
proceed from eggs; that, in viviparous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
the firſt produce of conception is a kind
of egg; and that the only difference between
the viviparous and oviparous is, that, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
the foetuſes begin to exiſt, increaſe, and
acquire their full growth in the uterus; but that,
in the oviparous animals, the foetuſes begin to
exiſt in the body of the mother, where they are
in the form of eggs; and it is only after their
excluſion that they become real foetuſes. And
it deſerves to be remarked, ſays he, that, in ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous
animals, ſome retain their eggs till they
be perfect, as birds, ſerpents, and oviparous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds;
and that others exclude their eggs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are perfect, as fiſhes, cruſtaceous, and
teſtaceous animals. The eggs laid by thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are only the rudiments of eggs, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
acquire membranes and a white, and
attract nouriſhment from the matter with which
they are ſurrounded. There are even, he adds,
inſects, caterpillars, for example, which are only
imperfect eggs; they ſearch for their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and, at the end of a certain time, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0195400702:93"/>
at the ſtate of a chryſalis, which is a perfect
egg. Another difference may ſtill be remarked
in oviparous animals: The eggs of hens, and
other birds, are of all different ſizes; but thoſe
of fiſhes, frogs, &amp;c. who lay them before they
are perfect, are all of the ſame ſize. He indeed
obſerves, that, in pigeons, who lay two eggs, all
the ſmall eggs that remain in the ovarium are of
the ſame bulk; and that the two only which are
next to be excluded exceed the ſize of the reſt.
The ſame thing happens in cartilaginous fiſhes,
as in the ray, which only brings to maturity two
eggs at a time, all the reſt being of different
ſizes, like thoſe of the hen.</p>
               <p>He next deſcribes anatomically the parts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to generation; and remarks, that the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of the anus and vulva in birds differ from
thoſe of all other animals, the anus being placed
before, and the vulva behind<note n="*" place="bottom">Moſt of theſe facts are taken from Ariſtotle.</note>. And, with
regard to the cock, and all ſmall birds, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
that they have no proper penis, and that
they generate by rubbing, without any intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
But male-ducks, geeſe, and oſtriches,
are amply provided with this inſtrument.</p>
               <p>Hens produce eggs without the intervention
of the cock; but, though perfect, they are
fewer in number, and unfertile. He credits
not the common opinion, that a few days inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with the cock are ſufficient to impregnate
all the eggs which a hen will lay during the year;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0195400702:94"/>
but he acknowledges, that he ſeparated a hen
from the cock for 20 days, and that all the eggs
ſhe laid were fecundated. As long as the egg
remains attached to the ovarium, it is nouriſhed
by the veſſels of the common pedicle; but, when
it ſeparates from this pedicle, it receives the
white liquor and the ſhell from the matter with
which the canal of the uterus is filled.</p>
               <p>The two cords (<hi>chalazae</hi>) which Aquapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente
conſidered to be the germ, or part produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the male ſemen, are found in unimpreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
as well as impregnated eggs; and Harvey
properly obſerves, that theſe parts neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the male, nor receive the impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The part of the egg which receives the
impregnation is a ſmall white circle ſituated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the membrane that covers the yolk, and has
the appearance of a cicatrice about the ſize of a
lentil. Harvey likewiſe remarks, that this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrice
is found in all eggs, whether they be fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundated
or not; and that thoſe are deceived who
imagine it to be produced by the ſeed of the
male. It is of the ſame ſize and form in freſh
eggs as in thoſe which have been long kept.
But, as ſoon as the proceſs of hatching is begun,
whether by means of artificial heat, or by the heat
of the hen, this ſmall mark or cicatrice gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
augments and dilates like the pupil of the
eye. This is the firſt change, and it is viſible
after a few hours incubation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0195400702:95"/>
When the egg has been heated for 24 hours,
the yolk, which was formerly in the centre,
riſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the cavity at the thick end of the
egg This cavity continues to enlarge by the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the more fluid part of the white;
and the heavieſt part of the white falls down to
the ſmall end. The cicatrice or ſpeck on the
membrane of the yolk, is elevated along with
it, and applies itſelf to the membrane which
lines the cavity at the thick end. This ſpeck
is now as large as a pea; and a white point is
diſtinguiſhable in the middle of it, with ſeveral
circles, of which this point appears to be the
common centre.</p>
               <p>At the end of the ſecond day, theſe circles are
larger and more conſpicuous, and they divide the
ſpeck ſometimes into two, and ſometimes into three
parts, of different colours. A ſmall external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberance
likewiſe appears, which nearly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
a little eye, with a white point or cataract
on the pupil. Between the circles a liquor, as
tranſparent as cryſtal, is contained by means of
a very thin membrane. The ſpeck, which is
now become a kind of bubble, or liquid globe,
appears as if it were ſituated in the white, rather
than on the membrane of the yolk. On the third
day the tranſparent liquor, as well as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
in which it is incloſed, is conſiderably aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
On the 4th, a ſmall line of blood, of
a purple colour, appears on the circumference of
the bubble; and, at a little diſtance from the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0195400702:96"/>
centre, we perceive a dot or point, of a bloody
colour, which beats like a heart. It is viſible at
every diaſtole, and diſappears during the ſyſtole.
From this animated point two ſmall blood-veſſels
iſſue, and terminate in the membrane which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the tranſparent cryſtalline liquor. Theſe
blood-veſſels ſet off from the ſame place, nearly
in the ſame manner as the roots of a tree ſet off
from the trunk; and it is in the angle which
theſe roots form with the trunk, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the liquor, that the animated point is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of the fourth, or beginning
of the fifth day, the animated point is ſo much
enlarged, that it has the appearance of a ſmall
bladder filled with blood; and, by its contractions
and dilatations, it is alternately filled and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied.
On the ſame day we diſtinctly perceive,
that this bladder is divided into two parts, each of
which dilates and contracts in the ſame manner.
Round the ſhorteſt of the blood-veſſels deſcribed
above, a kind of cloud appears, which, though
tranſparent, obſcures the view of the veſſel. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
hour this cloud becomes thicker; it attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
itſelf to the root of the blood-veſſel, and ſeems
to depend from it like a ſmall globe. This globe
extends and appears to divide into three parts,
one of which is globular, and larger than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two; and here we perceive the rudiments
of two eyes, and of the whole head: And, at
the end of the fifth day, we ſee, in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of this lengthened globe, the beginnings of
the vertebrae.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0195400702:97"/>
On the ſixth day, the parts of the head are
more apparent. We diſtinguiſh the coats of the
eyes, the thighs, and wings; and then the liver,
the lungs, and the beak. The foetus now begins
to move and to ſtretch out its head, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the viſcera are yet formed; for the
thorax, the abdomen, and all the external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings
of the fore part of the body, are ſtill
wanting. At the end of this day, or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ſeventh, the claws begin to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
the chick opens and moves its beak; and
the anterior parts of the body begin to cover the
viſcera. On the ſeventh day, the chick is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
formed; and, from this time till it iſſues
from the egg, nothing happens but an expanſion
of all the parts it acquired during the firſt ſeven
days. The feathers appear on the 14th or 15th
day; and, on the 21ſt, it eſcapes from the egg,
by breaking the ſhell with its bill.</p>
               <p>Theſe experiments of Harvey appear to have
been made with the greateſt exactneſs and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
In the ſequel, however, we ſhall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
their imperfection, and that the author has
probably fallen into the common error of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
experiments, with a view to eſtabliſh his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
hypotheſis, that the firſt animated point
which appeared was the heart. But, before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to this object, it is proper to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his other experiments.</p>
               <p>Every body knows the many experiments of
Harvey made upon female deer. They receive
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0195400702:98"/>
the male about the middle of September. A
few days after copulation, the <hi>horns</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Two fleſhy proceſſes, one of which iſſues from each ſide of the <hi>fundus uteri,</hi> in the form of little <hi>horns,</hi> and are remarkable in ſome quadrupeds.</note> of the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
appear to be thicker and more fleſhy than
uſual: They are, at the ſame time, more lax and
flabby; and, in each of their cavities, five ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runculae,
or ſoft warts, appear. About the 26th
or 28th of September, the uterus is ſtill thicker;
the five carunculae are ſwelled nearly to the ſize
and form of a nurſe's nipple. On opening them
with a ſcalpel, they appeared to be filled with an
infinite number of white points. Harvey pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to have remarked, that, neither now, nor
immediately after copulation, had the ovarium
ſuffered any change; and that he never could
diſcover, after repeated trials, the leaſt drop of
male ſemen in the uterus.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of October, or the beginning
of November, when the females were ſeparated
from the males, the thickneſs of the <hi>horns</hi> began
to diminiſh; the internal ſurfaces of their cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were ſwelled, and ſeemed to be glued toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The carunculae ſtill remained; and the
whole reſembled the ſubſtance of the brain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo ſoft that it could not be touched. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
tells us, that on the 13th or 14th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he perceived filaments, like thoſe of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
web, which traverſed the cavities of the
<hi>horns,</hi> and even that of the uterus itſelf. Theſe
filaments aroſe from the ſuperior angle of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0195400702:99"/>
                  <hi>horns,</hi> and, by their number, formed a kind of
membrane or empty coat. A day or two after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
this coat or ſac was filled with a white,
aqueous, viſcid matter, and adhered to the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
by means of a ſpecies of mucilage; and the
adheſion was moſt ſenſible at the ſuperior part of
the uterus, where the rudiments of the placenta
began then to appear. In the third month, this
ſac contained an embryo of two fingers breadth
in length, and alſo an internal ſac, called the
amnios, incloſing a tranſparent cryſtalline liquor,
in which the foetus ſwam. The foetus, at
firſt, was only an animated point, like what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the hen's egg. Every thing now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
and terminated in the ſame manner as
deſcribed with regard to the chick, with this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
difference, that the eyes of the chick appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much ſooner than thoſe of the deer. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
point was viſible about the 19th or 20th
of November. A day or two afterwards, the
oblong body, which contained the rudiments of
the foetus, made its appearance. In ſix or ſeven
days more, the foetus was ſo compleatly formed,
that all its members, and even its ſex, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable.
But the heart and viſcera were
ſtill bare; and it was not till a day or two after,
that they were covered with the abdomen and
thorax. This is the laſt work, the ſlating of the
edifice.</p>
               <p>From theſe experiments upon hens and deer,
Harvey concludes, that all female animals have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0195400702:100"/>
eggs; that in theſe eggs a ſeparation of a tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
cryſtalline liquor, contained in a ſac (<hi>amnios</hi>),
takes place, and that another external ſac (<hi>chorion</hi>)
incloſes the whole liquors of the egg; that the
firſt thing which appears in the cryſtalline li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is an animated ſanguineous point; and, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
that the formation of viviparous animals
is effected in the ſame manner with that of the
oviparous: The following is the account which
he gives of the generation of both.</p>
               <p>Generation, he obſerves, is an operation of the
uterus alone; for not a drop of the male ſemen
ever enters it. The uterus conceives by a kind
of contagion, communicated to it by the ſemen
of the male, nearly in the ſame manner as the
load-ſtone communicates a magnetic virtue to
iron. This male contagion acts not only on the
uterus, but on the whole body of the female,
which is entirely fecundated, though the uterus
alone poſſeſſes the faculty of conception, in the
ſame manner as the brain has the ſole power of
conceiving ideas. The ideas conceived by the
brain are ſimilar to the images of the objects
tranſmitted to it by the ſenſes; and the foetus,
which may be regarded as the idea of the uterus,
is ſimilar to that which produces it. This is the
reaſon why children reſemble their fathers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I will follow the ſyſtem of our anatomiſt no
farther: What has been ſaid is ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
the reader to judge of it. But we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
of importance to make concerning his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0195400702:101"/>
experiments. He has repreſented them in a
manner the moſt plauſible and inſinuating. He
appears to have often repeated them, and to have
taken every neceſſary precaution to avoid fallacy
and deception; and, of courſe, we are led to
think that he has ſeen every thing which poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
could be diſcovered. Uncertainty and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,
however, are perceptible in his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
His obſervations are related from memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and he ſeems, though he often maintains
the contrary, to have made Ariſtotle, more than
experience, his guide; for he has ſeen every
thing in eggs, and very little more, than was
mentioned by that philoſopher. That the moſt
material of his obſervations were made long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his own time, we ſhall be convinced by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to what follows.</p>
               <p>Ariſtotle knew, that the cords (chalazae) in
eggs were of no uſe in the generation of the
chick: 'Quae ad principium lutei grandines
haerent, nil conferunt ad generationem, ut qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
ſuſpicantur<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Anim. lib. 6. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note>.' Pariſanus, Volcher Coiter,
Aquapendente, &amp;c. had remarked the ſmall ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrice,
as well as Harvey. Aquapendente be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
it to be of no uſe; but Pariſanus main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that it was formed by the male ſemen,
or, at leaſt, that the white point in the middle
of the cicatrice was the ſemen of the male, and
that it was the rudiments of the foetus, 'Eſtque,'
ſays he, 'illud galli ſemen alba et tenuiſſima tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0195400702:102"/>
abductum, quod ſubſtat duabus communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
toti ovo membranis,' &amp;c. Hence the only
diſcovery proper to Harvey is his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
the exiſtence of this cicatrice, both in
fecundated and unfecundated eggs; for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
writers had obſerved, as well as he, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation
of the circles, and the growth of the
white point. Theſe are all the remarks Harvey
has made in his account of the two firſt days of
incubation; what he mentions concerning the
third day is only a repetition of what Ariſtotle
delivers in the ſixth book and fourth chapter of
his hiſtory of animals: 'Per id tempus aſcendit
jam vitellus ad ſuperiorem partem ovi acutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,
ubi et principium ovi eſt et foetus exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur;

               <p>Harvey, becauſe Ariſtotle ſays that the yolk
riſes to the ſmall end of the egg, concludes that
he had ſeen nothing himſelf, but had received
his information from ſome other pretty accurate
obſerver. In this accuſation, Harvey evidently
injures Ariſtotle; for the riſing of the yolk to
either end, ſolely depends upon its poſition du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of incubation; for the yolk, being
lighter than the white, uniformly mounts to the
top, whether the large or the ſmall end of the
egg be uppermoſt. This obſervation we owe to
William Langley, a phyſician in Dordrecht, who
made experiments on the hatching of eggs in the
year 1655, about 20 years before Harvey's
time<note n="*" place="bottom">See Langly obſerv. editae a Juſto Schradero, Amſt. 1674.</note>.</p>
               <p>But, to return to the paſſage we have quoted.
It is apparent, that the cryſtalline liquor, the
animated point, the two circles, the two blood-veſſels,
&amp;c. are deſcribed by Ariſtotle in the ſame
manner as they were ſeen by Harvey. This
anatomiſt maintains, that the animated point is
the heart, that the heart is the firſt part of the
foetus which is formed, and that the viſcera and
other members ſucceed. All this has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by Ariſtotle, and ſeen by Harvey; and
yet it is by no means conſonant to truth. To be
aſſured of this fact, we have only to repeat the
ſame experiments, or to read with attention thoſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0195400702:104"/>
of Malpighius<note n="*" place="bottom">Malpighii pullus in ovo.</note>, which were made about 50
years after the trials of Harvey.</p>
               <p>Malpighius carefully examined the cicatrice,
which is the eſſential part of the egg; he found
that it was large in impregnated eggs, and ſmall
in thoſe which had received no impregnation;
and he diſcovered, that, in eggs which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been ſit upon, the white point, mentioned by
Harvey as the firſt part that becomes animated,
is a ſmall purſe or bubble ſwimming in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
bounded by the firſt circle; and that the
embryo is viſible in the centre of this purſe.
The membrane of the purſe, which is the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios,
being exceedingly thin and tranſparent,
allowed him to ſee diſtinctly the foetus within
it. Malpighius, from this firſt obſervation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with propriety, that the foetus exiſts in
the egg before incubation, and that the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the embryo are even then deeply rooted.
It is unneceſſary to mention how much this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
differs from the opinion of Harvey;
for he had obſerved nothing begun to be formed
during the two firſt days of incubation; and, in
his eſtimation, the firſt veſtige of a foetus is the
animated point, which appears not till the third
day. But Malpighius diſcovered that the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the whole foetus exiſt before incuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is commenced.</p>
               <p>After aſcertaining this important fact, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pighius
proceeded to examine the cicatrice of
unimpregnated eggs, which, as formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0195400702:105"/>
is ſmaller than in thoſe that have received
an impregnation. Its margin is often irregular,
and its texture ſometimes differs in different eggs.
Near its centre, in place of a bubble including
the foetus, there is a globular mole or unorgani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
maſs, which, when opened, preſents nothing
like regularity or arrangement of parts: It has
only ſome appendages filled with a thick but
tranſparent liquor; and this unformed maſs is
ſurrounded and enveloped in ſeveral concentric
circles.</p>
               <p>After ſix hours incubation, the cicatrice is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
enlarged; and, in its centre, a bubble
or globule formed by the amnios is eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable.
This globule is filled with a fluid,
in the middle of which the head and back-bone
of the chick viſibly appear. Six hours after
this, every thing is enlarged, and, of courſe,
more apparent to the eye. In ſix hours more,
that is, 18 hours after the commencement of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubation,
the head is larger, and the ſpine is
lengthened; and, at the end of 24 hours, the
head of the chick appears in a bended poſture,
and the ſpine is of a whitiſh colour. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae
are ranged on each ſide of the ſpine, like
ſmall globules; and, nearly at the ſame time,
the wings begin to ſprout, and the head, neck,
and breaſt, are lengthened. At the end of 30
hours, nothing new appears; but all the parts
are enlarged, and eſpecially the amnios. Round
this membrane, may be remarked the umbilical
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0195400702:106"/>
veſſels, which are of a dark colour. In 38 hours,
the chick has acquired more ſtrength; its head
is very large, and three veſicles appear in it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with membranes, which likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the ſpine of the back, through which,
however, the vertebrae are ſtill viſible. At the
end of 40 hours, it was admirable to obſerve,
continues our author, the chick living in the
centre of the liquor of the amnios. The back-bone
was increaſed, the head was bended, the
veſicles of the brain were leſs bare, the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the eyes appeared, the heart beat, and
the blood circulated. Here Malpighius deſcribes
veſſels and the circulation of the blood; and he
thought, with reaſon, that, though the heart did
not beat till 38 or 40 hours after incubation was
begun, it nevertheleſs exiſted before, as well as
the other parts of the chick. But, on exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the heart in a dark chamber, he obſerved
nothing like luminous ſparks iſſuing from it, as
Harvey ſeems to inſinuate.</p>
               <p>At the end of the ſecond day, the foetus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſwimming in the liquor of the amnios;
the head, which ſeemed to be compoſed of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles,
was bended; the back-bone and verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae
were lengthened; the heart, which hung
out of the breaſt, beat three times ſucceſſively,
becauſe the fluid it contains is puſhed from the
auricle into the ventricles, from the ventricles
into the arteries, and, laſtly, into the umbilical
veſſels. He remarks, that, having ſeparated the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0195400702:107"/>
chick from the white of the egg, the motion of
the heart continued for a whole day. In 14
hours more, or 62 hours from the beginning of
the incubation, the chick, though ſtronger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſtill with its head bended in the liquor
of the amnios: Veins and arteries were perceived
among the veſſels of the brain; and the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the eyes, and of the ſpinal marrow, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
At the end of three days, the body of the
chick was crooked. Beſide the two eyes, five
veſicles filled with liquor appeared in the head;
the rudiments of the thighs and of the wings
were diſcernible; the body began to take on
fleſh; and the pupils of the eyes, and likewiſe
the cryſtalline and vitreous humours, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable.
At the termination of the fourth
day, the veſicles of the brain were nearer each
other; the proceſſes of the vertebrae were long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
the wings and the thighs had become ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
in proportion as they grew longer; the whole
body was covered with an unctuous fleſh; the
umbilical veſſels had pierced through the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and the heart was concealed within the
breaſt, which was now ſhut up by a thin mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.
On the fifth, and at the end of the ſixth
day, the veſicles of the brain began to be covered;
the ſpinal marrow, which was now more ſolid,
was divided into two parts, and advanced along
the trunk; the thighs and wings were longer,
and the wings were unfolded; the abdomen was
ſhut and tumified; the liver was diſtinctly viſible,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0195400702:108"/>
and of a dark colour; the two ventricles of the
heart beat; the body of the chick was covered
with ſkin; and the points of the feathers began
to appear. On the ſeventh day, the head was
very large; the brain was covered with its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes;
the beak appeared between the two
eyes; the wings, the thighs, and the legs, had
acquired their perfect form; the heart ſeemed
to be compoſed of two ventricles, like two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
globules, united at their ſuperior part
with the auricles; and two ſucceſſive pulſes were
remarked both in the ventricles and auricles, as
if there had been two ſeparate hearts.</p>
               <p>But I will follow Malpighius no farther. The
remainder of the detail regards the growth and
perfection of the parts till the chick breaks the
ſhell in which it is incloſed, and becomes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
of a new world. The heart is the laſt
part that aſſumes its proper figure, by the union
of its ventricles, which happens not till the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh
day.</p>
               <p>We are now in a condition to form a diſtinct
judgment concerning the value of Harvey's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.
It is probable that this celebrated
anatomiſt did not make uſe of the microſcope,
(which was, indeed, very imperfectly known in
his days), otherwiſe he never would have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that there was no difference between the
cicatrice of impregnated and unimpregnated
eggs; he never would have ſaid, that the ſemen
of the male produced no change upon the egg,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0195400702:109"/>
and particularly upon the cicatrice; he never
would have advanced, that nothing was percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
before the end of the third day; that the
animated point appeared firſt; and that the white
point was transformed into the animated point:
He would have perceived that the white point
was the bubble or globule which contained the
whole apparatus of generation; and that all the
rudiments of the foetus commenced there from
the moment of receiving the impregnation of
the cock: He would likewiſe have diſcovered,
that, without this impregnation, it contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an unformed maſs, which could never
become animated; becauſe, in fact, it is not
organized like an animal, and becauſe it is only
after this maſs, which ought to be regarded as a
collection of the organic particles of the female
ſemen, is penetrated by the organic particles of
the male ſemen, that an animal is formed. This
formation is inſtantaneous; but the motions of
the new animal are imperceptible till 40 hours
after the proceſs of incubation has commenced:
He would not have aſſured us, that the heart is
firſt formed, and that the other parts are ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
joined to it by juxta-poſition; ſince it is
apparent, from the experiments of Malpighius,
that the rudiments of all the parts are formed at
once, but that they become perceptible only in
proportion as they are ſucceſſively unfolded:
Laſtly, if he had ſeen, as Malpighius ſaw, he
would not have poſitively aſſerted, that no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0195400702:110"/>
of the male ſeed remained in the eggs,
and that it was only by contagion that they
were impregnated, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is alſo proper to remark, that what Harvey
has ſaid concerning the parts of generation of
the cock is by no means exact. He affirms,
that the cock has no penis capable of entering
the vagina of the hen. It is certain, however,
that this animal, in place of one penis, has a
couple, which both act at the ſame time; and
this action is a vigorous compreſſion, if not an
actual copulation<note n="*" place="bottom">See Regn. Graaf, p. 242.</note>. It is by this double organ
that the cock throws his ſeminal liquor into the
uterus of the hen.</p>
               <p>Let us now compare Harvey's experiments
upon female deer with thoſe of de Graaf upon
female rabbits; and, though de Graaf believed,
as Harvey did, that all animals proceed from
eggs, we ſhall find a very great difference in the
manner in which theſe two anatomiſts have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the firſt formation, or rather the expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
of the foetuſes of viviparous animals.</p>
               <p>After exerting every effort to prove, by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
drawn from comparative anatomy, that
the teſticles of viviparous females are true ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
Graaf explains the manner in which the
eggs are detached from the ovaria, and fall into
the <hi>horns</hi> of the uterus; and then he relates the
remarks he made upon a rabbit which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected
half an hour after copulation. The horns
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0195400702:111"/>
of the uterus, he ſays, were uncommonly red;
there was no change either in the ovaria, or in
the eggs which they contained; and there was
not the leaſt appearance of ſemen in the vagina,
in the uterus, or in the <hi>Fallopian tubes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having diſſected another rabbit, ſix hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
copulation, he obſerved, that the follicles, or
coats, which, in his eſtimation, contain the eggs
in the ovarium, were become red; but he found
no male ſemen either in the ovaria or any where
elſe. Twenty hours after copulation, he diſſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a third; he remarked in one ovarium three,
and in the other five follicles much altered; for
inſtead of being clear and limpid, they were
become opaque and reddiſh. In another, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected
twenty-ſeven hours after copulation, the
horns of the uterus, and the ſuperior canals
which terminate in them, were ſtill more red,
and their extremities embraced the ovarium on
all ſides. In another, which was opened forty
hours after copulation, he found in one ovarium
ſeven, and in the other three follicles changed.
Fifty-two hours after copulation, he examined
another, and found in one ovarium four changed
follicles, and one in the other; and having open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe follicles, he diſcovered in them a kind
of glandular liquor, with a ſmall cavity in the
middle, where he could perceive no fluid, which
made him ſuſpect that the tranſparent liquor
uſually contained in the follicles, and which, he
ſays, is incloſed in its own membranes, might
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0195400702:112"/>
have been diſcharged by ſome kind of rupture.
He ſearched for this matter in the canals which
terminate in the horns of the uterus, and in the
horns themſelves; but he found nothing. He
only remarked, that the membranes which line
the horns of the uterus were much ſwelled. In
another rabbit, diſſected three days after copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
he obſerved, that the ſuperior extremity
of the canal, which terminates in the horns of
the uterus, ſtraitly embraced the ovarium on
every ſide: And, having ſeparated it from the
ovarium, he remarked, in the right ovarium,
three follicles ſomewhat larger and harder than
uſual. After ſearching with great care the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
above mentioned, he diſcovered, he ſays, an
egg in the right canal, and two more in the
right horn of the uterus, ſo ſmall that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not muſtard ſeeds. Theſe little eggs
had each two membranes, and the internal one
was filled with a very limpid liquor. Having
examined the other ovarium, he found four
changed follicles; three of them were whiter,
and had likewiſe ſome limpid liquor in their
centres; but the fourth was of a darker colour,
and contained no liquor, which made him ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the egg had eſcaped from it. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſearched the correſponding canal and horn
of the uterus; he found an egg in the ſuperior
extremity of the horn, which was exactly ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to thoſe he had diſcovered in the right horn.
He alledges, that the eggs, when they are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0195400702:113"/>
from the ovarium, are ten times leſs than
before their ſeparation; and this difference in
ſize, he imagines, is owing to the eggs, while in
the ovarium, containing another matter, namely,
the glandulous liquor which he remarked in the
follicles.</p>
               <p>Four days after copulation, he opened another
rabbit, and he found in one ovarium four, and
in the other three follicles void of eggs: In the
horns correſponding to the ovaria, he found four
eggs on one ſide, and three in the other. Theſe
eggs were larger than thoſe he had diſcovered
three days after copulation. They were nearly
of the ſize of the lead-ſhot uſed for ſhooting
ſmall birds; and he remarked, that, in theſe
eggs, the interior membrane was ſeparated from
the exterior, and appeared as if a ſecond egg
was contained within the firſt. In another, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected
five days after copulation, he found five
empty follicles in the ovaria, and an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of eggs in the uterus, to which they adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
very firmly. Theſe eggs were as large as
the ſhot employed for killing hares, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
membrane was ſtill more apparent than
in the laſt experiment. Having opened another
rabbit, ſix days after copulation, he found in
one of the ovaria ſix empty follicles, but only
five eggs in the correſponding horn of the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
and they ſeemed to be all accumulated into
one maſs: In the other ovarium, he ſaw four
empty follicles, and found but one egg in the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0195400702:114"/>
correſponding horn. Theſe eggs were of the
ſize of the largeſt fowling ſhot. Seven days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
copulation, our anatomiſt opened another
rabbit, and he found in the ovaria ſome empty
follicles, which were larger, harder, and more
red than thoſe he had formerly obſerved; and
he perceived as many tranſparent tumors in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts of the uterus; and, having opened
them, he took out the eggs, which were as large
as ſmall <hi>piſtol</hi> bullets. The internal membrane
was more diſtinct than formerly; and within this
membrane he ſaw nothing but a very clear li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.
In another, diſſected eight days after co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation,
he found in the uterus the tumors or
cells which contain the egg; but they adhered
ſo ſtrongly to the uterus, that he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach
them. In another, which he opened nine
days after copulation, he found the cells con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the eggs greatly enlarged, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the middle of the liquor incloſed by
the internal membrane a ſmall thin cloud. In
another, which he opened ten days after copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
the ſmall cloud was thicker and darker,
and formed an oblong body like a little worm.
Laſtly, twelve days after copulation, he diſtinctly
perceived the embryo, which, though two days
before, it was only an oblong body, was now ſo
apparent, that he could diſtinguiſh its different
members. In the region of the breaſt, he ſaw
two red and two white points, and, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,
a mucilaginous reddiſh ſubſtance. Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0195400702:115"/>
days after copulation, the head of the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
was large and tranſparent; the eyes were
prominent; the mouth was open; the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the ears appeared; the back-bone was
whitiſh, and bended towards the ſternum, and
ſmall blood-veſſels aroſe from each ſide of it,
the ramifications of which extended along the
back as far as the legs: The two red points
were conſiderably enlarged, and appeared like
the rudiments of the ventricles of the heart; on
each ſide of the red points he ſaw two white
ones, which were the rudiments of the lungs.
In the abdomen he ſaw the rudiments of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which was reddiſh, and a ſmall body twiſted
like a thread, which was the ſtomach and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines.
After this, till the 31ſt day, when the
female rabbit brings forth, there was nothing to
be remarked but the gradual expanſion and
growth of the parts which were already formed.</p>
               <p>From theſe experiments, De Graaf concludes,
that all viviparous females have eggs; that theſe
eggs are contained in the ovaria or teſticles;
that they cannot be ſeparated till they are fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
by the ſemen of the male; becauſe, ſays
he, the glandular liquor, by means of which the
eggs are enabled to eſcape from their follicles,
is not ſecreted till after an impregnation by the
male. He alledges, that thoſe who imagine they
have ſeen pretty large eggs in three days, have been
deceived; becauſe, in his opinion, the eggs, though
fecundated, remain longer in the ovarium, and,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0195400702:116"/>
in place of augmenting, they become ten times
leſs than formerly, and they never begin to
grow till after their deſcent from the ovaria in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the uterus.</p>
               <p>By comparing theſe obſervations of Graaf
with thoſe of Harvey, we will eaſily perceive
that the latter has miſſed the principal facts:
And, though there are ſeveral errors both in the
reaſoning and in the experiments of De Graaf,
this anatomiſt, as well as Malpighius, have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
themſelves to be better obſervers than
Harvey. They agree in all fundamental points,
and both of them contradict Harvey. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
not the alterations which take place in the
ovaria; he ſaw not in the uterus thoſe ſmall
globules which contain the materials of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and which are called eggs by De Graaf;
he never ſuſpected that the foetus exiſted in this
egg; and, though his experiments give us tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
exact ideas concerning what happens du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the growth of the foetus, he furniſhes no
information concerning the commencement of
fecundation, nor concerning the firſt expanſion
of the foetus. Schrader, a Dutch phyſician,
who had a great veneration for Harvey, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that he cannot be truſted in many articles,
and particularly in what relates to the firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the embryo; for the chick really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts
in the egg before incubation; and, he ſays,
that Joſeph of Aromatarius was the firſt who
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0195400702:117"/>
made this material obſervation<note n="*" place="bottom">See Obſ. Juſti Schraderi, Amſt. 1674.</note>. Beſides, though
Harvey alledged that all animals proceeded from
eggs, he never imagined that the teſticles of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
contained eggs; and it was only from a
compariſon between the ſac, which he believed
to be formed in the uterus of viviparous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
with the growth and covering of the eggs
in oviparous animals, that he maintained that all
animals were produced from eggs; and even
this is only a repetition of what Ariſtotle had
ſaid before him. Steno was the firſt who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have diſcovered eggs in the ovaria of
females. He ſays, that, in diſſecting a female
ſea-dog, he perceived eggs in the teſticles, though
this animal be viviparous; and he adds, that the
teſticles of women are analogous to the ovaria
of oviparous animals, whether the eggs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
fall into the uterus, or only the matter
which they contain. Steno was the firſt who
diſcovered theſe ſuppoſed eggs; De Graaf is
willing to aſſume the diſcovery to himſelf; and
Swammerdam warmly diſputes the point with
him, and alledges that Van-Horn had ſeen them
before De Graaf. This laſt writer, it is true,
has been accuſed of aſſerting many things which
have been contradicted by experiments: He
even pretended, that a certain judgment might
be formed of the number of foetuſes in the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
by the number of cicatrices or empty fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licles
in the ovaria. In this he is contradicted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0195400702:118"/>
by the experiments of Verrheyen<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 2. chap. 3. edit. De Bruxelles, 1710.</note>, by thoſe of
M. Mery<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. de l'acad. 1701.</note>, and by ſome of his own, where he
found fewer eggs in the uterus, than cicatrices
in the ovaria. Beſides, we ſhall demonſtrate that
what he ſays concerning the ſeparation of the
eggs, and the manner in which they deſcend
into the uterus, is by no means exact; that no
eggs exiſt in the teſticles of females; that what
is ſeen in the uterus is not an egg; and that the
ſyſtems which have been deduced from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of this celebrated anatomiſt are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
chimerical.</p>
               <p>This pretended diſcovery of eggs in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of females attracted the attention of moſt
anatomiſts. They only found, however, in the
teſticles of viviparous females, ſmall bladders;
thoſe they heſitated not to conſider as real eggs,
and, therefore, they called the teſticles <hi>ovaria,</hi>
and the veſicles <hi>eggs.</hi> They aſſerted alſo, like
De Graaf, that theſe eggs differed in ſize in the
ſame ovarium; that the largeſt in the ovaria of
women exceeded not the bulk of a ſmall pea;
that they are very ſmall in young girls; but that
they increaſed with age and intercourſe with
men; that not above 20 could be reckoned in
each ovarium; that theſe eggs are fecundated
in the ovarium by the ſpirituous part of the
male ſemen; that they then ſeparate and fall
into the uterus by the Fallopian tubes, where the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0195400702:119"/>
foetus is formed of the internal ſubſtance of the
egg, and the placenta of its external part; that
the glandulous matter, which exiſts not in the
ovarium till after a fruitful embrace, compreſſes
the egg, and excludes it from the ovarium, &amp;c.
But, though Malpighius, who examined mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
more accurately, detected many errors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by thoſe anatomiſts even before they were
received; yet moſt phyſicians adopted the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of De Graaf, without regarding the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of Malpighius, which were neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of the greateſt importance, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
much weight from the experiments of his
diſciple Valiſnieri.</p>
               <p>Malpighius and Valiſnieri, of all naturaliſts,
appear to have written with moſt judgment and
acuteneſs on the ſubject of generation. We
ſhall, therefore, give an account of their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and remarks.</p>
               <p>Malpighius, having examined the teſticles of
a number of cows and other female animals,
aſſures us, that he found, in the teſticles of all
of them, veſicles of different ſizes, whether the
females were very young or adults. Theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles
are enveloped in a pretty thick membrane,
the inſide of which is interſperſed with blood-veſſels;
and they are filled with a kind of lymph
or liquor, which coagulates and hardens by the
heat of a fire, like the white of an egg.</p>
               <p>In proceſs of time, a firm yellow body ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres
to the teſticles. It is prominent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0195400702:120"/>
to the ſize of a cherry, and occupies the
greateſt part of the ovarium. This body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of ſeveral angular lobes, the poſition of
which is very irregular, and it is covered with a
coat or membrane interſperſed with nerves and
blood-veſſels. The form and appearance of this
yellow body varies conſiderably at different
times. When it exceeds not the ſize of a grain
of millet, it is roundiſh, and its ſubſtance, when
cut, has a warty appearance. We often find an
external covering round the veſicles of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,
which conſiſts of the ſame ſubſtance with
the yellow bodies.</p>
               <p>When the yellow body has become nearly of
the ſize of a pea, it reſembles a pear; and, in the
centre of it, there is a ſmall cavity filled with
liquor. The ſame thing may be remarked when
it is as large as a cherry. In ſome of theſe
yellow bodies, after they have arrived at full
maturity, Malpighius affirms that he ſaw, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the centre, a ſmall egg with its appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages,
about the ſize of a millet ſeed; and, after
they had diſcharged theſe eggs, they were flaccid
and empty. They then reſembled a cavernous
canal; and the void cavities were as large as
peas. He conceived that Nature deſigned this
yellow glandular body for the preſervation of
the egg, and for making it eſcape from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles;
and that, perhaps, it contributed to the
formation of the egg; conſequently, he remarks,
the veſicles which are at all times found in the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0195400702:121"/>
ovarium, and always differ in ſize, are not the
true eggs which receive the impregnation, but
only ſerve to produce the yellow bodies in which
the eggs are formed. Beſides, though theſe yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
bodies are not always found in every ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium;
yet we always find the rudiments of
them. Malpighius found the marks of them in
new born heifers, in cows with calf, and in preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
women; and, therefore, he properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that theſe yellow glandular bodies are
not, as De Graaf aſſerts, an effect of impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The yellow bodies, he remarks, produce
unfecundated eggs, which fall out of the ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
independent of any communication with
the male, and alſo thoſe which fall after impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
When the impregnated eggs fall into
the uterus, every thing proceeds in the manner
deſcribed by De Graaf.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations of Malpighius demonſtrate,
that the teſticles of females are not real ovaria;
that the veſicles they contain are not eggs; that
theſe veſicles never fall into the uterus; and that
the teſticles, like thoſe of males, are only reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs
containing a liquor which may be regarded
as female ſemen in an imperfect ſtate. This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
is matured in the yellow glandular bodies,
of which it fills the internal cavities, and flows
out after the yellow bodies have acquired their
full ſize.</p>
               <p>But, before we form a judgment concerning
this important point, we muſt attend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
of Valiſnieri.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0195400702:122"/>
In the year 1692, Valiſnieri began his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
upon the teſticles of the ſow. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles
of the ſow differ from thoſe of cows, of
mares, of ſheep, of ſhe-aſſes, of female-dogs,
of ſhe-goats, of women, and of moſt viviparous
animals; for they reſemble a ſmall bunch of
raiſins, the grains of which are round and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
on the outſide; between theſe grains are
ſmaller ones, not yet arrived at maturity. Theſe
grains appear not to be covered with a common
membrane. They are, ſays he, analogous to
the yellow bodies obſerved in cows by Malpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius;
they are round, and of a reddiſh colour;
their ſurface is interſperſed with blood-veſſels,
like the eggs of viviparous animals; and the
whole grains together form a maſs that is larger
than the ovarium. With a little addreſs, theſe
grains may be ſeparated from the ovarium, and
each of them, after ſeparation, leaves a nitch or
depreſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe glandular bodies are not of the ſame
colour in every ſow. In ſome they are more
red; in others more clear; and they are of all
ſizes, from the ſmalleſt ſeed, to that of a raiſin.
On opening them, a triangular cavity appears,
filed with a limpid liquor, which coagulates
with heat, and becomes white, like that which
is contained in the veſicles. Valiſnieri expected
to find the egg in ſome of theſe cavities: But in
this he was diſappointed; though he made a
careful ſearch into all the glandular bodies of a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0195400702:123"/>
number of ſows, and other animals, he could
never diſcover the egg, which Malpighius af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
he found once or twice.</p>
               <p>Under theſe glandular bodies, the veſicles of
the ovarium appeared. They were more or leſs
numerous, according as the glandular bodies
were larger or ſmaller; for, in proportion to the
largeneſs of the glandular bodies, the veſicles
diminiſhed. Some veſicles were of the ſize of a
lentil, and others exceeded not that of a millet
ſeed. In the teſticles, when raw, from 20 to
35 veſicles might be reckoned; but, when boiled,
a much greater number appear, and they are ſo
firmly attached, that they cannot be ſeparated
without breaking ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Having examined the teſticles of a young ſow,
which had never brought forth, he found, as in
the others, the glandular bodies; and their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular
cavities were likewiſe filled with lymph;
but he could not diſcover any eggs either in the
one or the other. The veſicles of this young
ſow were more numerous than in thoſe which had
brought forth, or thoſe which were impregnated
at the time of examination. In the teſticles of
another ſow, which was far advanced in preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
Valiſnieri found two of the largeſt glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular
bodies, which were flaccid and empty, and
others, of a leſſer ſize, in their ordinary ſtate;
and, in ſeveral others which he diſſected when
with young, he remarked, that the number of
glandular bodies was always greater than the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0195400702:124"/>
number of foetuſes. This confirms what we
obſerved concerning the experiments of De Graaf,
and proves that they are by no means exact.
What he calls follicles of the ovarium are only
the glandular bodies, the number of which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
exceeds that of the foetuſes. In the ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
of a ſow, two or three months old, the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
were pretty large, and interſperſed with
veſicles of a conſiderable ſize. Among the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles,
the beginnings of four glandular bodies
appeared in one teſticle, and of ſeven in the
other.</p>
               <p>After theſe experiments upon ſows, Valiſnieri
repeats thoſe of Malpighius upon cows, and he
found them to be exactly conformable to truth.
He indeed acknowledges, that he was never
able to diſcover the egg which Malpighius ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
he had ſeen once or twice in the interior
cavity of the glandular bodies. After a fruitleſs
ſearch in the teſticles of ſo many different fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males,
it was natural to think, that Valiſnieri
would at leaſt have doubted the exiſtence of ſuch
eggs. But prejudice in favour of ſyſtem made
him admit, contrary to his own experience, the
exiſtence of eggs, which neither he nor any
other man ever ſaw, or will ſee.</p>
               <p>It is, perhaps, impoſſible to make a greater
number, or more exact experiments, than Valiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieri
has done. Among other animals, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the ewe, and found, that ſhe has never
any more glandular bodies in her teſticles than
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0195400702:125"/>
foetuſes in the uterus. In young ewes, which
were never impregnated, there is but one glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular
body in each teſticle, and, when one is
emptied, it is ſucceeded by another; if a ewe
has one foetus in the uterus, ſhe has only one
glandular body in her teſticles; and if ſhe has
two foetuſes, ſhe has likewiſe two glandular bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
This glandular body occupies the greateſt
part of the teſticle; and, after it is emptied and
diſappears, another begins to grow for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of a future generation.</p>
               <p>In the teſticles of a ſhe-aſs, he found veſicles
as large as ſmall cherries, which is an evident
proof that they are not eggs, as it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for them to paſs, by the Fallopian tubes,
into the uterus.</p>
               <p>The teſticles of female wolves, dogs, and
foxes, are covered with a membrane, like a purſe,
which is an expanſion of that which ſurrounds
the <hi>horns</hi> of the uterus. In a bitch which began
to be in ſeaſon, but had not been approached by
the male, Valiſnieri found the internal part of
this purſe, which does not adhere to the teſticle,
moiſtened with a liquor that reſembled whey,
and two glandular bodies in the right teſticle,
about two lines in diameter, and which occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
nearly the whole extent of the teſticle.
Each glandular body had a ſmall nipple, with a
diſtinct fiſſure, from which, without preſſing it,
there iſſued a liquor like clear whey; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concluded, that this liquor was the ſame
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0195400702:126"/>
which he found in the purſe. He blew into this
fiſſure with a pipe, and the whole glandular
body immediatly ſwelled; and, having introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a briſtle, he eaſily penetrated to the bottom
of it. He opened the body on that ſide where
he had introduced the briſtle, and found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
cavity which communicated with the
nipple, and contained a conſiderable quantity of
liquor. Valiſnieri was always in hopes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the egg; but theſe hopes, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his reſearches, were uniformly fruſtrated.
He likewiſe found, in the left teſticle, two glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular
bodies very ſimilar to thoſe in the right.
He boiled two of theſe glandular bodies, hoping,
that, by this means, he might diſcover the egg,
but ſtill without any meaſure of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Having diſſected another bitch four or five
days after ſhe had received the male, he found
in the teſticles three glandular bodies exactly
ſimilar to the former. He ſearched every where
for the egg; but he was ſtill diſappointed. By
the aſſiſtance of the microſcope, he diſcovered
the glandular bodies to be a net-work compoſed
of an infinite number of globular veſicles, which
ſerved to filtre the liquor which iſſued through
the nipple.</p>
               <p>He then opend another bitch which was not
in ſeaſon, and having tried to introduce air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the teſticle and the purſe which covered
it, he found that it dilated like a bladder filled
with air. Having removed the purſe, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0195400702:127"/>
two glandular bodies upon the teſticles;
but they had neither nipple nor fiſſure, and no
liquor diſtilled from them.</p>
               <p>In another bitch that had brought forth about
five whelps two months before, he found five
glandular bodies; but they were much diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſize, and they began to diſappear without
leaving any cicatrices; there remained only a
ſmall cavity in their centre; but it contained no
liquor.</p>
               <p>Not ſatisfied with theſe and many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
Valiſnieri, who paſſionately deſired
to diſcover this pretended egg, called together
the beſt anatomiſts his country afforded, and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others, M. Morgagni; and, having open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a young bitch that was for the firſt time in
ſeaſon, and that had been covered three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they examined the veſicles of the teſticles,
the glandular bodies with their nipples, their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
and the liquor in their internal cavities;
but they could perceive no eggs. He then, with
the ſame intention, made experiments on ſhe-goats,
foxes, cats, a number of mice, &amp;c. In
the teſticles of all theſe animals, he uniformly
found the veſicles, and frequently the glandular
bodies with the liquor they contained; but no
egg ever appeared.</p>
               <p>In fine, being deſirous of examining the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles
of women, he had an opportunity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
a young country-woman, who had been
ſome years married, and who was killed by a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0195400702:128"/>
fall from a tree. Though of a robuſt and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
conſtitution, ſhe had never born any chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
He endeavoured to diſcover if the cauſe
of her barrenneſs exiſted in the teſticles; and
he found that the veſicles were all filled with a
blackiſh and corrupted matter.</p>
               <p>In a young girl of eighteen years of age, who
had been brought up in a convent, and who had
every appearance of real virginity, he found the
right teſticle a little longer than the left: It was
of an oval figure, and its ſurface was ſomewhat
unequal. This inequality was occaſioned by five
or ſix veſicles which protruded on the outſide of
the teſticle. One of theſe veſicles, which was more
prominent than the reſt, he opened, and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of lymph ruſhed out of it. This veſicle was
ſurrounded with a glandular ſubſtance, in the
ſhape of a creſcent, and of a reddiſh yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
He cut the teſticle tranſverſely, and found
a number of veſicles filled with limpid liquor;
and he remarked, that the Fallopian tube of this
teſticle was redder and ſomewhat longer than the
other, as he had often obſerved in other animals
when they were in ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The left teſticle was whiter, and its furface
more ſmooth; for, though ſome veſicles were a
little prominent, none of them were in the form
of nipples; they were all ſimilar to each other,
and the correſponding Fallopian tube was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſwelled nor red.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0195400702:129"/>
In the teſticles of a girl, aged five years, he
found the teſticles with their veſicles, their blood-veſſels,
and their nerves.</p>
               <p>In the teſticles of a woman of ſixty years, he
diſcovered ſome veſicles, and the veſtiges of a
glandular ſubſtance, like large points of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
yellowiſh brown colour.</p>
               <p>From all theſe obſervations, Valiſnieri con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that the work of generation is carried on
in the female teſticles, which he continued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
as ovaria, though he never could find any
eggs in them, and though, on the contrary, he
had diſcovered that the veſicles were not eggs.
He ſays, likewiſe, that, for the impregnation of
the egg, it is not neceſſary that the male ſemen
ſhould enter the uterus. He ſuppoſes, that the
egg eſcapes through the nipple of the glandular
body, after being impregnated in the ovarium;
that it then falls into the Fallopian tube; that it
gradually deſcends, and at laſt attaches itſelf to
the uterus: He adds, that he is fully perſuaded,
that the egg is concealed in the cavity of the
glandular body, though neither he nor any other
anatomiſt was ever able to diſcover it.</p>
               <p>In his eſtimation, the ſpirit of the male ſeed
aſcends into the ovarium, penetrates the egg,
and gives motion to the foetus which previouſly
exiſted in it. In the ovarium of the original
mother of mankind, he obſerves, were eggs,
which contained not only all the children ſhe
produced, but of the whole human race. If
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0195400702:130"/>
this chain of infinite individuals contained in
one, be incomprehenſible to us, it is entirely
owing to the imbecillity of our minds, of which
we have daily proofs. But it is not, therefore,
leſs conſonant to truth, that all the animals which
have exiſted, or can exiſt, were created at once,
and were all included in their firſt mothers. The
reſemblance of children to their parents is owing,
he continues, to the imagination, which acts ſo
forcibly on the foetus as to produce ſtains, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroſities,
diſorder of parts, and extraordinary
concretions, as well as perfect ſimilarities.</p>
               <p>This ſyſtem of eggs, though it explains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and has no foundation in Nature, would
have obtained the univerſal ſuffrages of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
if, nearly about the ſame time, another
opinion had not ſprung up, founded upon the
diſcovery of ſpermatic animals.</p>
               <p>This diſcovery, which we owe to Leeuwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoek
and Hartſoeker, was confirmed by Andri,
Valiſnieri, Bourguet, and many other obſervers.
I ſhall relate what has been advanced concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe ſpermatic animals which are found in
the ſemen of all males. Their number is ſo
great, that the ſemen ſeems to be entirely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of them; and Leeuwenhoek pretends to
have ſeen many millions of them in a drop leſs
than the ſmalleſt grain of ſand. Though none
of them appear in females, they are found in the
emitted ſemen of all males, in the teſticles, and
in the veſiculae ſeminales. When the ſemen of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0195400702:131"/>
a man is expoſed to a moderate heat, it thickens,
and the motion of all the animalcules is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſtopped. But, when allowed to cool,
it dilutes, and the animals continue in motion
till the liquor again thickens by evaporating.
The more this fluid is diluted, the number of
animalcules are augmented; and, when greatly
diluted by the addition of water to it, the whole
ſubſtance of the fluid ſeems to be compoſed of
animals When the motion of the animalcules
is about to ceaſe, either on account of heat or of
drying, they appear to approach nearer each
other, to have a common circular motion in the
centre of the ſmall drop under obſervation, and
to periſh, all of them, at the ſame inſtant. But,
when the quantity of liquor is greater, it is eaſy
to diſtinguiſh them dying in ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe animalcules are ſaid to be of different
figures in different animals; but they are all
long, thin, without any members, and move
with rapidity in every direction. The fluid in
which they are contained, as formerly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is much heavier than blood. The ſemen of
a bull, when chemically analyzed by Verrheyen,
yielded firſt phlegm, then a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of foetid oil, a very ſmall proportion of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
ſalt, and more earth than he expected<note n="*" place="bottom">See Verrheyen ſup. anat. tom. 2. p. 69.</note>.
This author was ſurpriſed that he could draw no
ſpirit from the diſtillation of this liquor; and,
as he imagined it contained a great quantity of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0195400702:132"/>
ſpirits, he attributed the evaporation of them to
their ſubtility. But may we not ſuppoſe, with
more probability, that it contains little or no
ſpirits? Neither the conſiſtence, nor the odor of
this fluid, indicate the preſence of ardent ſpirits,
which never abound but in fermented liquors;
and, with regard to volatile ſpirits, the horns,
bones, and ſolid parts of animals, afford more of
them than the fluids. What has received the
appellation of ſeminal ſpirits, <hi>aura ſeminalis,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
anatomiſts, has, perhaps, no exiſtence;
and it is certain, that the moving bodies appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the ſeminal fluid, are not agitated by theſe
ſpirits. But, that we may be enabled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
more clearly concerning the nature of
the ſemen, and of its animalcules, we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the reader with the principal obſervations
which have been made on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Leeuwenhoek, having examined the ſemen
of a cock, perceived a number of animals ſimilar
to river eels; but they were ſo minute, that 50,000
of them were not equal in bulk to a grain of
ſand. Of thoſe in the ſemen of a rat, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
he ſays, many millions to make the
thickneſs of a hair, &amp;c. This excellent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was perſuaded, that the whole ſubſtance of
the ſemen was only a maſs of animalcules. He
ſaw theſe animalcules in the ſemen of men, of
quadrupeds, of birds, of fiſhes, and of inſects.
In the ſemen of a graſs-hopper, the animalcules
were long, and extremely thin. They appeared,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0195400702:133"/>
he ſays, to be attached by their ſuperior end;
and the other end, which he calls their tail, had
a briſk motion, like that of the tail of a ſerpent
when its head is fixed. In the ſemen of young
animals, when examined before they have any
ſexual appetite, he alledges that he ſaw the ſame
minute animals, and that they had no motion:
But, when the ſeaſon of love arrived, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcules
moved with great vivacity.</p>
               <p>In the ſemen of a male frog, he ſaw animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules;
but, at firſt, they were imperfect, and
had no motion: Some time after, he found them
alive. They were ſo minute, he obſerves, that
ten thouſand of them were only equal in bulk
to a ſingle egg of the female.</p>
               <p>In the ſemen of a man and that of a dog, he
pretended to ſee two ſpecies of animalcules, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
males and females. Having ſhut up
the ſemen of the dog in a ſmall vial, he ſays,
that a great number of animalcules died the firſt
day; that, on the ſecond and third day, ſtill
more of them died; and that few of them were
alive on the fourth day. But, having repeated
this experiment on the ſemen of the ſame dog,
he found, at the end of ſeven days, the animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules
as briſk and lively as if they had been
newly extracted from the animal: And, having
opened a bitch that, ſome time before the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
had been three times covered by the ſame
dog he could not perceive, with his naked eye,
any male ſemen in the uterus or its appendages;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0195400702:134"/>
but, by the aſſiſtance of the microſcope, he found
the ſpermatic animals of the dog in both <hi>horns</hi>
of the uterus: In that part of the uterus which
is neareſt the vagina, he diſcovered great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which evidently proves, ſays he, that the
male ſemen enters the uterus, or, at leaſt, that
the ſpermatic animals of the dog had arrived
their by their own motion, which enables them
to paſs over 4 or 5 inches in half an hour. In
the uterus of a female rabbit, which had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the male, he obſerved an infinite number
of ſpermatic animals. He remarks, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of theſe animals are round; that they have
long tails; and that they often change their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
eſpecially when the fluid in which they
ſwim begins to dry up.</p>
               <p>Theſe experiments of Leeuwenhoek were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
by ſeveral people, who found them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
conſonant to truth. But Dalenpatius, and
ſome others, who were inclined to exceed Leeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenhoek
in acuteneſs of viſion, alledged that,
in the ſemen of a man, they not only found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
reſembling tadpoles, whoſe bodies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be as large as a grain of corn, with
tails about four times as long as their trunks,
and who moved with great agility; but, what
is ſtill more amazing, Dalenpatius ſaw one of
theſe animals break through its coat or covering:
It was then no more an animalcule, but a real
human body, in which he eaſily diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0195400702:135"/>
the two arms and legs, the breaſt and the head<note n="*" place="bottom">See nouvelles de la republic des lettres, ann. 1699, p. 552.</note>.
But it is apparent, from the very figures, given
by this author, of the embryo which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have ſeen eſcape from its covering, that
the fact is abſolutely falſe. He believed that
he ſaw what he deſcribes; but he was deceived;
for this embryo, according to his deſcription, was
more completely formed, at the time of its tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration
from the condition of a ſpermatic
worm, than it is in the uterus of the mother at
the end of the fourth or fifth week. Hence
this obſervation of Dalenpatius, inſtead of being
confirmed by future experiments, has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by all naturaliſts, the moſt acute of whom
have only been able to diſcover in the ſeminal
fluid of man, round or oblong bodies, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have long tails, but no members of any
kind.</p>
               <p>One would be tempted to think that Plato had
been acquainted with thoſe ſpermatic animals
which are transformed into men; for, at the
end of his Timacus<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 1088, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

of animals is full of animalcules. Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus
talks of certain worms which aſſume the
human figure; and Ariſtotle tells us, that the
firſt men iſſued from the earth in the form of
worms. But neither the authority of Plato, of
Ariſtotle, of Hippocrates, of Democritus, nor of
Dalenpatius, will ever be able to beſtow credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
on a notion which is repugnant to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
experience and obſervation of all thoſe
who have hitherto made inquiries into this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>Valiſnieri and Bourguet perceived ſmall
worms in the ſemen of a rabbit: One of their
extremities was longer than the other; they were
very active in their motions, and beat the fluid
with their tails: Sometimes they raiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the top of the liquor, and ſometimes
ſunk to the bottom; at other times they turned
round, and twiſted like ſerpents: In fine, ſays
Valiſnieri, I clearly perceived them to be real
animals: 'E gli riconobbi, e gli giudicai ſenza

in favour of the ovular ſyſtem, admitted
the actual exiſtence of ſpermatic animals.</p>
               <p>M. Andry pretends, that he could find no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
in human ſemen previous to the age of
puberty; that they exiſt not in the ſemen of
very old men; that there are few of them in
thoſe who are affected with the venerial diſeaſe,
and that theſe few are in a languiſhing ſtate;
that none of them appear alive in impotent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and that the animalcules in the ſemen of
men have a larger head than thoſe of other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
which correſponds, he obſerves, with
the figure of the foetus and infant; and he adds,
that thoſe who uſe women too frequently have
generally few or no animalcules in their ſemen.</p>
               <p>Leeuwenhoek, Andry, and others, exerted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
effort againſt the egg-ſyſtem: They diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the ſemen of all males living animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules;
they proved that theſe animalcules could
not be regarded ſimply as inhabitants of this
fluid, ſince the quantity of them was larger than
that of the fluid itſelf; and ſince nothing ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to them exiſted either in the blood, or in any
other of the animal fluids: They maintained,
that, as females furniſhed no animalcules, their
fecundity was ſolely derived from the males;
that the exiſtence of living animals in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
throw more light upon the nature of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0195400702:138"/>
than all the former diſcoveries on this
ſubject; becauſe the greateſt difficulty in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to conceive how life is firſt produced, the
future expanſion and growth of the parts being
only acceſſory operations; and, conſequently,
that not a doubt remained of theſe animalcules
being deſtined to become men, or perfect ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
according to their ſpecies. When the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
was objected to them, that millions
of animalcules, all equally capable of becoming
men, ſhould be employed for this purpoſe, while
only one of them was to enjoy the ſingular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of being admitted into the condition of
humanity; when it was demanded of them,
why this uſeleſs profuſion of human germs?
they replied, That it correſponded with the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
magnificence of Nature; that, in plants and
trees, millions of ſeeds were produced, while only
a few of them ſucceeded; and that, therefore,
we ought not to be ſurpriſed at the prodigious
number of ſpermatic animals. When the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
minuteneſs of a ſpermatic worm, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the body of a man, was mentioned
to them as a difficulty, they anſwered, that the
ſeeds of trees, of the elm, for example, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
minute, when compared with the perfect
individuals; and they added, with equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
metaphyſical arguments, by which they
proved, that largeneſs and minuteneſs were only
relations, and that the tranſition from ſmall to
great, or from great to ſmall, was performed by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0195400702:139"/>
Nature with greater facility than we could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
imagine.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they aſked, are there not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
examples of the transformation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects?
Do we not daily ſee ſmall aquatic worms,
by ſimply throwing off their ſkin or covering,
from which they received their external figure,
transformed into winged animals? May not
ſpermatic animalcules, by a ſimilar transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
become perfect animals? Every thing,
therefore, they conclude, concurs in eſtabliſhing
this ſyſtem of generation, and in overturning
that which is founded on the notion of eggs;
and, though eggs really exiſted in viviparous
animals, as well as in the oviparous, theſe eggs
would only be the matter neceſſary for the
growth and expanſion of the ſpermatic worm,
which enters by the pedicle that attaches the
egg to the ovarium, where it finds abundance of
nouriſhment prepared for it. All the worms
which are ſo unfortunate as to miſs this paſſage
through the pedicle into the egg, periſh, and that
one alone which finds the proper road, is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into a perfect animal. The difficulty of
finding this paſſage is ſufficient to account for
the great number and apparent profuſion of the
ſpermatic animals. It is a million to one againſt
any individual worm's finding this paſſage; but,
to compenſate this difficulty, there are more than
a million of worms. When a worm has once
got poſſeſſion of an egg, no other can enter into
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0195400702:140"/>
it; becauſe, ſay they, the firſt worm ſhuts up the
paſſage; or rather, there is a valve at the entry
to the pedicle, which plays while the egg is not
perfectly full; but, when the worm has filled
the egg, this valve will not open, though puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a ſecond worm. Beſides, this valve is
exceedingly well contrived; for, if the worm
ſhould chance to deſcend through the paſſage by
which it entered, the valve prevents its eſcape,
and obliges it to remain till it be tranſformed.
The ſpermatic worm then becomes a real foetus;
and it is nouriſhed by the ſubſtance of the egg,
and the membranes ſerve it for a covering; and,
when the nouriſhment contained in the egg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to fail, the foetus attaches itſelf to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſurface of the uterus, and, by this means,
extracts nouriſhment from the blood of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till, by its weight, and the increaſe of its
ſtrength, it at laſt breaks off all connection with
the uterus, and iſſues into the world.</p>
               <p>According to this ſyſtem, it was not the firſt
woman, but the firſt man, who contained all
mankind in his own body. The pre-exiſtent
germs are no longer inanimate embryos locked
up in eggs, and included, <hi>in infinitum,</hi> within each
other. They are, on the contrary, ſmall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
or organized living <hi>homunculi,</hi> included in
each other in endleſs ſucceſſion, and which, to
render them men, or perfect animals, require
nothing but expanſion, and a transformation ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to that of winged inſects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0195400702:141"/>
As phyſicians are at preſent divided between
the ſyſtem of ſpermatic worms, and that of eggs,
and, as every new writer upon generation has
adopted either the one or the other of theſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,
it is neceſſary to examine them with care,
and to ſhow not only their inſufficiency to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the phaenomena of generation, but that
they reſt upon ſuppoſitions which are entirely
deſtitute of probability.</p>
               <p>Both ſyſtems ſuppoſe an infinite progreſſion,
which, as formerly remarked, is a mere illuſion
of the brain. A ſpermatic worm is more than
a thouſand million of times ſmaller than a man.
If, then, the body of a man be taken as an unit,
the body of a ſpermatic worm will be expreſſed
by the fraction 1/1000000000, <hi>i. e.</hi> by a number
conſiſting of ten cyphers; and, as man is to a
ſpermatic worm of the firſt generation in the
ſame proportion as this worm is to a worm of
the ſecond generation, the ſize of this laſt ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
worm will be expreſſed by a number con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of 19 cyphers; for the ſame reaſon, the
ſize of a ſpermatic worm of the third generation
muſt be expreſſed by a number conſiſting of 28
cyphers, that of the fourth generation by 37
cyphers, that of the fifth generation by 46 cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and that of the ſixth generation by 55
cyphers. To form an idea of the minuteneſs
repreſented by this fraction, let us take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions
of the ſphere of the univerſe from the
Sun to Saturn; and, ſuppoſing the Sun to be a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0195400702:142"/>
million of times larger than the Earth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from Saturn a thouſand ſolar diameters,
we ſhall find that 45 cyphers are ſufficient to
expreſs the number of cubic lines contained in
this ſphere; and, if we reduce each cubic line
into a thouſand million of atoms, no more than
54 cyphers will be neceſſary to expreſs their
number: Of courſe, a man will be proportional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
greater, when compared with a ſpermatic
worm of the ſixth generation, than the ſphere
of the univerſe when compared to the ſmalleſt
atom that can be ſeen with the aſſiſtance of a
microſcope. But, if this calculation were carried
on to the 16th generation, the minuteneſs would
exceed all powers of expreſſion. It is apparent,
therefore, that the probability of this hypotheſis
vaniſhes in proportion as the object dininiſhes.
This calculation applies equally to eggs as to
ſpermatic worms; and the want of probability
is common to both. It will, no doubt, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that, as matter is infinitely diviſible, this
gradual diminution of ſize is not impoſſible.
To this I reply, that all infinities, whether in
geometry or in arithmetic, are only mental ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions,
and have no actual exiſtence in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
If the infinite diviſibility of matter is to
be regarded as an abſolute infinite, it is eaſy to
demonſtrate, that, in this ſenſe, it has no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence;
for, if we once ſuppoſe the ſmalleſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
atom, by the very ſuppoſition, this atom
muſt be indiviſible; becauſe, if it were diviſible,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0195400702:143"/>
it would not be the ſmalleſt poſſible atom, which
is contrary to the ſuppoſition. It is, therefore,
apparent, that every hypotheſis which admits
an infinite progreſſion ought to be rejected not
only as falſe, but as deſtitute of every veſtige
of probability; and, as both the vermicular and
ovular ſyſtems ſuppoſe ſuch a progreſſion, they
ſhould be excluded for ever from philoſophy.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſyſtems are liable to another objection:
In the ovular ſyſtem, the firſt woman contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both male and female eggs; the male eggs
could only give origin to males; but the female
eggs behoved to contain millions of generations
of both males and females: Hence every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
muſt have always contained a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of eggs capable of being unfolded <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
and another number, which could only be
unfolded once, and could have no farther ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the ſeries of exiſtence. The ſame
thing muſt take place in the vermicular ſyſtem.
Hence we may conclude, that there is not the
ſmalleſt degree of probability in hypotheſes of
this nature.</p>
               <p>A third difficulty ſtill remains, ariſing from
the reſemblance of children ſometimes to the
father, ſometimes to the mother, and ſometimes
to both, and from the evident characters of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific
differences in mules and other monſtrous
productions. If the foetus proceeds from the
ſpermatic worm of the father, how comes the
child to reſemble its mother? If the foetus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſts
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0195400702:144"/>
in the egg of the mother, how ſhould the
child reſemble its father? And, if the ſpermatic
worm of a horſe, or the egg of a ſhe-aſs, be the
origin of the foetus, how ſhould the mule par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the nature and figure both of the horſe
and aſs?</p>
               <p>Theſe general objections, though perfectly
invincible, are not the only difficulties with
which theſe ſyſtems are embarraſſed. May it
not be demanded of thoſe who embrace the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micular
ſyſtem, how theſe worms are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and wherein conſiſts the analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this transformation and that which inſects
undergo? The caterpillar which is to become a
butterfly, paſſes through a middle ſtate, and, after
it ceaſes to be a chryſalis, is completely formed,
has acquired its full growth, and is inſtantly
capable of generating: But, in the pretended
transformation of the ſpermatic worm of a man,
there is no middle or chryſalis ſtate; and, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this to happen during the firſt days of
conception, why is not the production of this
chryſalis, in place of an unformed embryo, a
perfect adult? Here all analogy ceaſes; and, of
courſe, the notion of the transformation of the
ſpermatic worm can receive no ſupport from this
quarter.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the worm which is to be transformed
into a flie proceeds from an egg; this egg is
produced by the copulation of the male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
and it includes the foetus which is to paſs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0195400702:145"/>
into a chryſalis, before it arrives at the perfect
ſtate of a flie, and before it acquires the power
of generating. But the ſpermatic worm has no
generative faculty; neither does it proceed from
an egg: And, though it ſhould be ſuppoſed that
the ſemen contains eggs which produce the ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
animals, the ſame difficulty ſtill remains;
for theſe ſuppoſed eggs are not a reſult of the
copulation of two ſexes, like thoſe of inſects. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
the analogy fails here likewiſe; and
the transformation of inſects, in place of ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
this hypotheſis, ſeems entirely to deſtroy
it.</p>
               <p>The ſeeds of vegetables are reſorted to, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to account for the infinite number of ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
animals: But this analogy does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
for, all the ſpermatic animals, one only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
muſt abſolutely periſh. The ſeeds of
vegetables, however, are not ſubject to the ſame
neceſſity. When they become not vegetables
themſelves, they nouriſh other organized bodies,
and ſerve the purpoſes of growth and of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to animals. But the prodigious ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity
of ſpermatic animals can anſwer no end
whatever. I make this remark, purely becauſe
I wiſh to omit nothing that has been advanced
on the ſubject; for I acknowledge, that no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
drawn from final cauſes can either
eſtabliſh or deſtroy a phyſical theory.</p>
               <p>The apparent equality in the number of ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
animalcules in all animals, has alſo been
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0195400702:146"/>
objected to by the ſupporters of this doctrine.
If theſe animalcules are the immediate cauſe of
generation, why is there no proportion between
their numbers and thoſe of the young, which
are various in men, quadrupeds, birds, fiſhes,
and inſects? Beſides, there is no proportional
difference in moſt ſpecies of ſpermatic animals,
thoſe of a rat being nearly equal in ſize to thoſe
of a man. Even when a difference in ſize takes
place, it has no proportion to the bulks of the
animals. The ſpermatic animals of the calmar,
which is a ſmall fiſh, are a hundred thouſand
times larger than thoſe of a man or of a dog.
This is an additional proof that theſe worms
are not the ſole and immediate cauſe of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The particular objections to the ovular ſyſtem
are not leſs weighty. If the foetus exiſted in
the egg before the junction of the male and
female, why do we not ſee the foetus in the egg
before impregnation, as clearly as after it? We
formerly mentioned, that Malpighius always
found the foetus in eggs which had received the
impregnation of the male, and could diſcover
nothing but an unformed mole or maſs in the
cicatrice of unimpregnated eggs. It is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
evident, that the foetus is never formed till
the egg has been impregnated.</p>
               <p>Farther, we not only cannot diſcover the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
in eggs before the intercourſe of the ſexes,
but we have not been able to demonſtrate the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0195400702:147"/>
exiſtence of eggs in viviparous animals. Thoſe
phyſicians who pretend that the ſpermatic worm
is the foetus incloſed in a coat or covering, are
at leaſt aſcertained of the exiſtence of ſpermatic
worms; but thoſe who maintain that the foetus
pre-exiſts in the egg, have no evidence of the
exiſtence of the egg itſelf; for the probability of
their non-exiſtence in viviparous animals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
almoſt to a certainty.</p>
               <p>Though the partizans of the ovular ſyſtem
agree nto as to what ought to be regarded as the
real egg in the teſticles of females, they all allow,
however, that impregnation is accompliſhed in
the teſticles or ovarium. But they never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that, if this were the caſe, moſt foetuſes
would be found in the abdomen in place of the
uterus; for, as the ſuperior extremity of the
Fallopian tube is unconnected with the ovarium,
the pretended eggs would often fall into the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen.
Now, we know this to be at leaſt a
very rare phaenomenon; and it is probable that
it never happens but by means of ſome violent
accident.</p>

In the hiſtory of the Academy of ſciences,
ann. 1701, ſome objections are propoſed by M.
Mery againſt the egg-ſyſtem. This able anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
maintained, with propriety, that the veſicles
found in the teſticles of females are not eggs;
that they adhere ſo firmly to the internal ſurface
of the teſticle, as not to admit of a natural ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and that, though they could ſeparate
from the ſubſtance of the teſticle, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for them to get out of it, becauſe the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the common membrane incloſing the
whole teſticle is ſo firm and ſtrong, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
to conceive the poſſibility of its being
pierced by a veſicle or round ſoft egg. And,
as moſt anatomiſts and phyſicians were prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
in favour of the egg-ſyſtem, and imagined
that the number of cicatrices in the teſticles cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded
with the number of foetuſes, M. Mery
ſhowed ſuch a quantity of theſe cicatrices in the
teſticles of a woman, as, upon the ſuppoſition of
the truth of this ſyſtem, would have argued a
fecundity beyond the power of credibility.
Theſe difficulties ſtimulated other anatomiſts of
the academy, who were partizans of the eggs,
to make new reſearches. M. Duverney ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the teſticles of cows and ſheep, and
maintained, that the veſicles were eggs, becauſe
ſome of them adhered leſs firmly to the teſticles
than others; and that it was natural to ſuppoſe
that they ſeparated altogether when they arrived
at full maturity; eſpecially as by blowing into
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0195400702:149"/>
the cavity of the teſticle, the air paſſed between
the veſicles and the adjacent parts. M. Mery
ſimply replied, that this proof was inſufficient,
as theſe veſicles were never ſeen ſeparate from
the teſticles. M. Duverney farther remarked
the glandular bodies upon the teſticles; but he
never conſidered them as parts eſſential to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
but as accidental excreſcences, like
gall-nuts on the oak. M. Littre, whoſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
in favour of eggs were ſtill ſtronger,
maintained, not only that the veſicles were eggs,
but even aſſured us, that he diſcovered in one of
them a well formed foetus, of which he could
diſtinguiſh both the head and trunk; and he has
even given their dimenſions. But, admitting
this wonder, which never appeared to any eyes
excepting his own, to be convinced of the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of the fact, we have only to peruſe his
memoir<note n="*" place="bottom">Année 1701, p. 111.</note>. From his own deſcription it appears,
that the uterus was ſchirrous, and the teſticle
very much corrupted; that the veſicle or egg,
which contained the pretended foetus, was much
leſs than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mmon, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Nuck furniſhes us with a celebrated experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in favour of eggs. He opened a bitch three
days after copulation; he drew out one of the
<hi>horns</hi> of the uterus, and tied it in the middle ſo
as to prevent the ſuperior part of the Fallopian
tube from having any communication with the
inferior part. After this he replaced the <hi>horn</hi> of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0195400702:150"/>
the uterus, and cloſed the wound. Twenty-four
days afterwards, he again opened the
wound, and found two foetuſes in the ſuperior
part of the tube, that is, between the teſticles and
the ligature; and there was no foetus in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part. In the other horn of the uterus, that
was not tied, he found three foetuſes regularly
diſpoſed; which proves, ſays he, that the foetus
proceeds not from the male-ſemen, but that it
exiſts in the egg of the female. Suppoſing this
experiment, which is ſingle, had been often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
with the ſame ſucceſs, the concluſion the
author draws from it is not legitimate: It proves
no more than that the foetus may be formed in
the ſuperior part of the horn of the uterus, as
well as in the inferior; and it is natural to think
that, by the preſſure of the ligature, the ſeminal
liquor in the inferior part was forced out, and,
of courſe, fruſtrated the work of generation in
that region of the uterus.</p>
               <p>This is all the length that anatomiſts and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
have proceeded in the ſubject of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It only remains that I deliver the reſults
of my own experiments and inquiries; and I
ſhall leave the reader to judge whether my ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
be not infinitely more conſonant to nature
than any of thoſe of which I have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

               <head>Experiments on Generation.</head>
               <p>I Often reflected on the above two ſyſtems of
generation, and was daily more and more
convinced that my theory was infinitely more
probable. At length I began to ſuſpect that theſe
living organic particles, from which I thought all
animals and vegetables derived their origin,
might be recognized, by the aſſiſtance of good
glaſſes. My firſt notion was, that the ſpermatic
animalcules found in the ſeminal fluid of all
males, might probably be theſe very organic
particles; and I reaſoned in this manner. If all
animals and vegetables contain an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of organic particles, theſe particles ſhould be
moſt abundant in their ſeeds, becauſe the ſeed is
an extract from all the organic parts, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from thoſe which are moſt analogous to the
individual: Perhaps the ſpermatic animals found
in the ſemen of males may actually be thoſe very
organic particles, or at leaſt, the firſt union or
aſſemblages of them. But, if this be the caſe,
then the ſemen of females ought to contain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
living particles, or animalcules, ſimilar to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0195400702:152"/>
thoſe of the male. They ought, for the ſame
reaſon, to be found in the ſeeds of plants, in the
nectarium, and in the ſtamina, which are the moſt
eſſential parts of vegetables, and contain the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles neceſſary for their reproduction.
I therefore determined to examine with the
microſcope the ſeminal liquors of males and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males,
and the germs of plants; and, at the ſame
time, I imagined that the cavities of the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
bodies of the uterus might be the reſervoirs
of the female ſemen. Having communicated
my ideas of this ſubject to my ingenious friends
Mr Needham, M. Daubenton, M. Gueneau, and
M. Dalibard, they encouraged me to commence
a ſet of experiments in order to throw light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this myſterious operation of nature. All of
theſe gentlemen occaſionally attended and aſſiſted
me; but particularly M. Daubenton, who was
never abſent, and who was witneſs to every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
I made.</p>
               <p>I employed a double microſcope, which I had
from Mr Needham, being the ſame with which
he made his numerous and ingenious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<note n="*" place="bottom">Publiſhed in the year 1745.</note>. This inſtrument is infinitely preferable
to thoſe employed by Leeuwenhoek<note n="†" place="bottom">Here M. de Buffon mentions the advantages of the double microſcope, and ſome precautions neceſſary in the management of it, which, now that the inſtrument is well known, and much improved ſince the author wrote, it is unneceſſary to tranſlate.</note>.</p>

                  <head>EXPERIMENT I.</head>
                  <p>Having procured the ſeminal veſſels of a man
who died a violent death, and whoſe body was
ſtill warm, I extracted all the liquor from them,
and put it in a vial. I examined, by the micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope,
a drop of this liquor, without any dilution.
As ſoon as the vapours, which aroſe from the
liquor, and obſcured the glaſs, were diſſipated, I
obſerved pretty large filaments [plate I. fig. 1.],
which, in ſome places, ſpread out into branches,
and, in others, intermingled with each other.
Theſe filaments clearly appeared to be agitated
with an internal undulatory motion, like hollow
tubes, which contained ſome moving ſubſtance.
I ſaw diſtinctly [pl. I. fig. 2.] two of theſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments,
which were joined longitudinally, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from each other in the middle, and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
approach and recede, like two ſtretched
cords, fixed by the ends, and drawn aſunder at
the middle. Theſe filaments were compoſed of
globules which touched one another, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
a chaplet of beads. I then obſerved fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
[pl. I. fig. 3.] which were blown up, and
ſwelled in certain places, and perceived ſmall
oval globules iſſue from theſe ſwelled parts,
which had a vibratory motion, like that of a
pendulum [pl. I. fig. 4.] Theſe ſmall bodies
were attached to the filament by little threads,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0195400702:154"/>
which gradually lengthened as the bodies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
And, laſtly, I obſerved theſe ſmall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
detach themſelves entirely from the large
filament, and draw after them the little thread,
which reſembled a tail. As the liquor was too
thick, and the filaments too near each other, I
diluted another drop with pure rain water, after
ſatisfying myſelf that it contained no animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.
I then perceived that the filaments were
more diſtant from each other, and ſaw diſtinctly
the motion of the ſmall bodies above taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, [pl. I. fig. 5.] which was more free,
and they appeared to ſwim with greater agility,
and trailed their threads after them with greater
eaſe; and, if I had not ſeen them ſeparate from
the filaments, and draw the threads out of them,
I ſhould have believed, from this ſecond obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
the moving bodies to be real animals, and
their threads to be tails. After examining with
great attention one of the filaments, which was
three times thicker than the ſmall bodies, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
two of thoſe bodies detach themſelves
with much difficulty, and drag after them long
ſlender threads, which impeded their motion.</p>
                  <p>This ſeminal liquor was at firſt too thick.
But it gradually became more fluid, and, in leſs
than an hour, it was almoſt tranſparent; and, in
proportion as its fluidity augmented, the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
changed, in the manner to be juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

                  <p>When the ſeminal liquor became more fluid,
the filaments diſappeared; but the ſmall bodies
were exceedingly numerous [pl. I. fig. 6.].
Their motion, for the moſt part, reſembled that
of a pendulum; each of them had a long
thread, from which they evidently endeavoured
to diſengage themſelves; their progreſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was extremely ſlow, during which they
vibrated to the right and left. At each vibration,
they had a rolling unſteady motion; ſo that,
beſides their horizontal vibrations, they roll or
vibrate in a vertical direction; which proves theſe
bodies to be of a globular figure, or at leaſt that
their inferior part is not a flat baſe ſufficiently
extenſive to keep them in one poſition.</p>

                  <p>At the end of two or three hours, when the

theſe moving bodies appeared [pl. I. fig. 7.].
They were more free of incumbrances; their
threads were ſhorter; their progreſſive motion
was more direct; and their horizontal vibration
was greatly diminiſhed; for the longer the
threads are, their vibratory motion was increaſed,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0195400702:156"/>
and their progreſs forward was diminiſhed. The

                  <p>In five or ſix hours, the liquor had almoſt all
the fluidity it could acquire, without being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed.
We then diſcovered [pl. II. fig. 8.]
that moſt of theſe ſmall moving bodies were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
diſengaged from their threads. Their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
was oval: They moved forward with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
quickneſs; and, by their motion back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and forward, and to every ſide, they had
now more than ever the appearance of real ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
Thoſe which had tails or threads ſticking
to them, ſeemed to have leſs vivacity than the
others. Of thoſe which had no threads, ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to change both their figure and their ſize.
Some of them were round; but the greateſt part
of them were oval, and a few of them were
thicker at the extremities than in the middle.
The rolling and vibratory motions were ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible.</p>

                  <p>In 12 hours, the liquor had depoſited, at the

that ſwimmed on the top was nearly as clear as
water, only it had a tincture of blue, like water
in which a ſmall quantity of ſoap has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.
It ſtill, however, retained its viſcoſity.
The little bodies, which were now entirely freed
from their threads, moved with great activity on
all ſides, and ſome of them turned round their
centres. Moſt of them were oval, though ſome
of them were round. I have ſeen them change
figures, and from oval become round: I have ſeen
them divide, and, from a ſingle oval or globule,
ſeparate into two. Their activity always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
as their ſize diminiſhed.</p>

                  <p>At the end of 24 hours, the liquor had depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
a greater quantity of gelatinous matter,
which I diluted, with ſome difficulty, in water.
It appeared to conſiſt of a multitude of opaque
tubes, reſembling lace, but without any regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

itſelf, there were a few ſmall bodies ſtill moving;

After this, nothing was to be ſeen but
globules without the leaſt appearance of motion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe experiments were often repeated with
great exactneſs; and they convinced me that the
threads which adhere to the moving bodies are
not tails, nor any part proper to theſe bodies;

for the tails or threads have no proportion to
the reſt of the body; they are of different di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions,
though the bodies are always nearly
of the ſame ſize at the ſame time. The motion
of the globule is embarraſſed in proportion to the
length of the tail. When the tail is too long,
it ſometimes prevents the progreſſive motion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
leaving nothing but the vibrations from
right to left; and the globules make evident
eſſorts to diſentangle themſelves from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance.</p>

                  <p>Having procured the ſeminal fluid of another

at firſt to have too little force to put them in

as they receded from the filaments, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0195400702:161"/>
to proceed in troops from one ſide of the
drop [pl. II. fig. 10.]. They paſſed over the
field of the microſcope in leſs than four ſeconds;
they marched in lines of ſeven or eight in front;
and ſucceeded each other without interruption,
like the defiling of ſoldiers. I obſerved this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

and, as the current of animals did not then ceaſe,
I was deſirous of diſcovering the cauſe. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gently ſhifted the glaſs, and perceived that
all theſe moving globules proceeded from a kind
of mucilage, [pl. II. fig. 11.] or net-work of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments,
which continually produced them, and
with more rapidity and copiouſneſs than the fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

ſtill a difference more remarkable between the
globules produced by the liquor when thick, and
thoſe produced when it was more fluid; for, in
the latter caſe, they drew no threads or tails af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, their motion was quicker, and they
went in flocks like ſheep. I examined the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage
from which they proceeded for a long

and was converted into moving globules, till
more than one half of it was deſtroyed. After
which, the liquor being too dry, this mucilage
became obſcure in the middle, and it was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded

ſearched this liquor for the ſilaments which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that of men. I only remarked ſome long
and very delicate threads, exactly ſimilar to thoſe
which ſerved for tails to the globules. Theſe
threads contained no globules; neither had they
any motion. The globules with tails ſeemed to
move with more vivacity than thoſe in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

vibrations; but they always rolled vertically.
Their number was not great; and, though their
progreſſive motion was quicker, they took up
ſome time in paſſing over the field of the micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope.
I examined this liquor during three
hours, and could obſerve no change. I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
my examination, from time to time, for
ſeveral days, and remarked, that the number of
moving bodies gradually diminiſhed. On the
ſecond day, the greateſt part of them had loſt
their tails: On the third, very few of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their tails; on the fourth, however, ſome
tails ſtill adhered. The liquor had now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
a whitiſh ſediment, which appeared to
be compoſed of globules without motion, and
ſome ſmall threads that ſeemed to be the tails
which had ſeparated from the globules. Some
globules appeared to have dead ones attached to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0195400702:165"/>
them; for their figure differed from that of thoſe
in motion, [Pl. III. fig. 14.]: They were larger
than the moving globules, or the dead ones at
the bottom of the liquor, and ſeemed to have a
kind of fiſſure or opening.</p>

obſerved, in a drop of this liquor, a mucilaginous
part, [Pl. III. fig. 15.] from which globules iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
as in Exper. IX. and theſe globules formed
a current, and moved in regular troops. This
mucilage appeared to be agitated internally with
a ſwelling or undulating motion, which produced
ſmall protuberances in different parts; and theſe
protuberances iſſued ſuddenly in the form of
globules, which moved briſkly forward in the ſame
direction. Theſe globules differed not from the
others, excepting that they iſſued from the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage

changed their figure; they lengthened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
till they reſembled ſmall cylinders; after
which the extremities of the cylinders ſwelled,
and divided by the middle into two globules,
and both of them moved on in the ſame direction

the ſame dog, another quantity of ſemen. But,
whether the animal had been fatigued by two
frequent emiſſions, or from ſome other cauſe,
this ſeminal liquor contained nothing: It was
tranſparent and viſcous, like the ſerum of blood;
and, though I examined it, at different times,

up the glaſs. Three days after, I examined this
infuſion with a view to diſcover if the fleſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

the water of this infuſion a great number of
moving bodies, ſome of them of a globular,
others of an oval figure, and entirely reſembling
thoſe I had ſeen in the ſeminal fluid of the dog,
excepting that they had no threads or tails:
They moved in all directions with great viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.

motion more rapid and more irregular; and
their form and manner of moving were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and appeared to be more confuſed: The
day after, and the following days, till the 20th,
moving bodies ſtill appeared in this water. They
daily diminiſhed in ſize, and at laſt became ſo
ſmall that they could be hardly perceived; but
the laſt of them I was able to diſtinguiſh on the
18th and 20th days, moved with the ſame ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
as ever. On the top of the water there
was a pellicle which appeared to be compoſed of
the ſkins or coverings of the moving bodies, of
ſmall threads, &amp;c. But no motion appeared in
it. This pellicle and the moving bodies could
not be introduced into the liquor by means of
the external air; for the bottle was always

                  <p>I opened ſucceſſively, on different days, ten
rabbits, in order to examine their ſeminal fluid.
In the firſt, ſecond, and third, I found not a
ſingle drop, either in the teſticles or ſeminal veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
though I was certain that two of them were
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0195400702:169"/>
fathers of a numerous progeny. I imagined
that the preſence of the female might be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the ſecretion of the ſemen; I therefore
put males and females by pairs into ſeparate
cages, ſo conſtructed that they could not poſſibly
copulate. Neither did this ſcheme at firſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
for I opened two of them without finding
any ſemen. In the ſixth, however, which was
a large white rabbit, full of vigour, I found as
much liquor in the ſeminal veſſels as would fill
a ſmall coffee-ſpoon. This matter reſembled
the jelly of meat, was of a citron colour, and
almoſt tranſparent. Having examined it with
the microſcope, it gradually ſeparated into fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and large globules, ſeveral of which were
attached to each other like a ſtring of beads;
but I could diſcover no diſtinct motion; only, as
the matter diſſolved, it formed a kind of current,
by which the filaments and globules were carried
down to one ſide of the glaſs. I waited till the
matter ſhould become more fluid; but I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed;
for, after liquifying a little, it dried
up, and I could obſerve nothing farther than
what I have already deſcribed. I then added
water to it, but without ſucceſs; for the water
ſeemed not to penetrate or dilute the matter.</p>

any of the yellow colour, and was more fluid
than the former. As the quantity was very

globules, and farther remarked, that they had a
kind of trembling reſtleſs motion. They had
alſo a progreſſive motion; but it was very ſlow:
Some of them moved round others, and moſt of
them appeared to turn round their centres. I
could proceed no farther in my obſervations,
becauſe the liquor dried ſuddenly up.</p>

                  <p>Having diſſected another rabbit, that had
been placed in the ſame circumſtances, I found
no ſeminal liquor; but, in the ſeminal veſſels of
another, I found nearly as much congealed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as in Exper. XVII. I examined this matter
without diſcovering any thing. I therefore took
the whole, and, adding to it a double quantity
of water, ſhook the mixture violently in a glaſs.
I then left it to ſettle for ten minutes; after
which I examined a drop taken from the ſurface,
and perceived the large globules formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
but they were few in number, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
detached from one another. They moved
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0195400702:171"/>
towards each other; but this motion was ſo ſlow,
as to be hardly perceptible. Two or three hours
after, the globules ſeemed to be diminiſhed in
ſize; their motion was more ſenſible; and they
turned upon their centres. Though their trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
was more apparent than their progreſſive
motion; yet they plainly changed places in an
irregular manner, with reſpect to each other.
In ſix or ſeven hours, the globules were become
ſmaller, and their activity was greater. Their
number appeared to be great, and all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were ſenſible. Next day there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
multitude of moving globules, and they
were at leaſt three times leſs than at firſt. I
continued my obſervations for eight days, and I
perceived that ſeveral of the globules joined;
and, though all motion ceaſed after this union,
it appeared only to be ſuperficial and accidental.
Some of them were larger, and others leſs;
though moſt of them were ſpherical, ſome of
them were oval, and others cylindrical. The
largeſt were moſt tranſparent; and the ſmalleſt
were almoſt black. This difference could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from no accident in the light; for they
were always of the ſame colour, whatever was
their ſituation: The motion of the ſmall globules
was likewiſe more rapid. The whole gradually
diminiſhed in ſize, ſo that, on the eight day they
were ſo ſmall that it was with the utmoſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty

totally diſappeared.</p>

                  <p>In fine, having, with great difficulty, procured
the ſeminal liquor of another rabbit, in the very
ſtate in which it is conveyed into the female, I
remarked, that it was much more fluid than that
which was extracted from the ſeminal veſſels;
and the phaenomena it preſented were alſo very
different: For, in this liquor there were moving
globules, filaments without motion, and a kind
of globules with tails or threads, ſimilar to thoſe
in the ſeminal fluid of man and of the dog, only
theſe laſt appeared to be leſs, and more active [Pl.
III. fig. 17.]. They traverſed, in an inſtant, the
field of the microſcope: Their tails ſeemed to
be much ſhorter than thoſe of other ſpermatic
animals; and I acknowledge, that I was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
whether ſome of theſe tails were not decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
occaſioned by the track of the globules in
the liquor; for they moved with ſuch rapidity,
that I could hardly obſerve them; and beſides,
the liquor, though ſufficiently fluid, dried very
ſuddenly.</p>

into a glaſs-veſſel, with as much water as was

greatly reſembled thoſe deſcribed in Exper. VIII.
Their motion was not rapid, but equal, uniform,
and in all directions. In each liquor, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
bodies were nearly of the ſame ſize; but,
in the one they were larger, in the other leſs, and,
in the third, ſtill more minute: They had no

ceaſed; ſo that I could never obſerve the ſame

                  <p>A live bitch was next diſſected, which had
been four or five days in ſeaſon, without having
any communication with the male. The teſticles
were as large as ſilberds. On one of them I found
a red prominent glandular body of the ſize of a
pea, which had a perfect reſemblance to a little
nipple, with a viſible fiſſure, that had two lips,
one of which was more prominent than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Having opened this fiſſure, a liquor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled
from it, which we collected for exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
The teſticles were then returned
into the body of the animal, which was ſtill
alive, in order to preſerve them from cold. I
then examined this liquor with the microſcope,
and had the ſatisfaction of perceiving, at the firſt
glance, moving bodies with tails, exactly ſimilar
to thoſe which we had obſerved in the ſeminal
fluid of the dog [pl. IV. fig. 20.]. Meſſrs Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham

ſtruck with this reſemblance, that they could not

be perſuaded that the ſpermatic animals were not
the very ſame; and they imagined that I had
forgotten to change the object-glaſs, or rather,
that the ſame pick-tooth with which the drops
of the female fluid were collected, had alſo been
employed in collecting thoſe of the male. Mr
Needham, therefore, changed both the object-glaſs
and the pick-tooth, and took a freſh drop
from the fiſſure of the glandular body, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
it firſt with his own eyes. He again ſaw
the very ſame moving bodies, and was fully

that of the glandular body. It was a tranſparent

teſticles, and upon each I found a glandular bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

and was full of ſeminal fluid; the ſecond was

out of both the glandular bodies, and, on

ſeminal liquor of the female is equally fluid with
that of the male. After examining the liquors
extracted from each teſticle, I found in them the
very ſame moving bodies [pl. IV. fig. 21.]. I
perceived at leiſure the ſame phaenomena that I

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0195400702:180"/>
great rapidity, which endeavoured to diſengage
themſelves from the mucilage that ſurrounded
them, and which dragged tails or threads after

four or five hours obſervation. I remarked that
it depoſited a kind of ſediment, or at leaſt began
to thicken. I took a drop of the thickeſt part
of the liquor, and having examined it, I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
that the mucilaginous part of the ſemen
was condenſed, and formed a kind of net-work.
From the anterior edge of this net-work, there
iſſued a current of globules which moved with
great rapidity [Pl. IV. fig. 22.]. Theſe globules
were extremely active and lively, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be diveſted of their mucilaginous co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings,
and of their tails. This ſtream of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules
reſembled the motion of the blood in the
veins; for they ſeemed not only to be animated,
but to be puſhed on by ſome common force,
which obliged them to follow each other in
troops or rows. From this experiment, and from
the 11th and 12th, I concluded, that, when the
fluid begins to coagulate or grow thick, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0195400702:181"/>
globules break their mucilaginous covering,
and eſcape at that ſide where the liquor is moſt
fluid. They had no threads or tails, and moſt
of them were oval, and ſeemed to be flat below;
for they had no rolling motion.</p>

one of them was a glandular body of the ſize of
a pea, which protruded from the teſticle like a

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0195400702:184"/>
On each teſticle there were four or five lymphatic

                  <p>I had two other uteri conveyed to me in the

Having preſſed the body with my fingers, a

bodies, [Pl. IV. fig. 22.], but different from what

The liquor was not thick: The moving globules

of a red fleſh-colour, and exceeded not the ſize
of a pea. It was ſolid, without any aperture,

But, what is not leſs remarkable than true, there
was not a ſingle cicatrice on either of them. A

                  <p>I procured the uteri of three other cows; and
I firſt ſearched the teſticles, in order to diſcover
if there were any mature glandular bodies. In
two of the uteri I found only ſmall glandular
bodies on the teſticles. I was not informed
whether the cows had ever brought forth; but
it is probable that they had often been in ſeaſon;
for a number of cicatrices appeared on their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles.
On one of the teſticles of the third cow,
I obſerved a glandular body as large as a cherry,
and very red; it was much ſwelled, and ſeemed
to be perfectly ripe. I preſſed the nipple, which
was perforated by a hole, with my fingers, and
a conſiderable quantity of liquor iſſued out. In
this liquor, I found moving bodies [Pl. IV.

Exper. XXXVI. Their number was indeed
greater, and their progreſſive motion was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
they ſeemed to be ſomewhat longer; and,
having obſerved them a long time, I perceived
that they grew longer, and changed their figure.
I then introduced a fine probe into the ſmall
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0195400702:188"/>
aperture of the glandular body; and, having
cut along the probe as a directory, I found that
the cavity was filled with a liquid matter. This
liquor, when examined with the microſcope,
preſented the ſame phaenomena, the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

diſcover in none of them either filaments or tails.
The liquor of the veſicles was ſtill tranſparent,
and contained nothing like life or motion.</p>

ripe; in thoſe of others, they were in different

or uncommon, excepting that I diſcovered, in the

been ſimply infuſed, and upon water in which
pink-ſeeds were infuſed. The bottles contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all theſe infuſions were exactly corked. At
the end of two days, I ſaw, in the oiſter-water,
a vaſt quantity of oval and globular bodies,
which ſeemed to ſwim like fiſhes in a pond, and
had every appearance of being real animals.
They had no members that could be diſcovered,
and no tails. They were tranſparent, and pretty
large; I ſaw them change their figures; they
became gradually ſmaller and ſmaller during
the ſeven or eight days that they ſubſiſted; and,
laſtly, along with Mr Needham, I ſaw animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules
ſo very ſimilar, in an infuſion of the jelly
of roaſted veal, which had likewiſe been cloſe
corked, that I am perſuaded they are not true
animals, agreeable to the common acceptation
of that term, as ſhall afterwards be fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
                  <p>The infuſion of pink-ſeeds was crowded with
innumerable moving globules, which appeared
to be equally animated with thoſe in the ſeminal

At firſt they were pretty large, and moved with
great rapidity in every poſſible direction. They
continued in this ſtate during three weeks, and
gradually diminiſhed in ſize till their minuteneſs
rendered them inviſible.</p>
                  <p>The ſame phaenomenon took place in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions

not appear ſo early as in the other infuſions, and
their appearance was later in the infuſion of pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

that what is called fermentation, might be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of fermentation, and that excited by mineral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
I applied to the microſcope a little lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone

different. Large bubbles roſe to the ſurface, and
inſtantly darkened the lens of the microſcope;
when the groſs parts were diſſolved, every thing

                  <p>Before I conclude this chapter, I ſhall relate
the experiments of Mr Needham upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of a ſpecies of cuttle-fiſh, called the <hi>Calmar.</hi>
This acute obſerver, having examined the ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
animals in the milts of different fiſhes,
found them of an uncommon magnitude in the
milt of the calmar. To the naked eye, they
were from three to four lines in length. During
a whole ſummer, while he diſſected calmars at
Liſbon, he could find no appearance of a milt,
or of any reſervoir deſtined to receive the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
liquor of that fiſh; and it was the middle of
December before he could perceive the firſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiges
of a new veſſel filled with a milty juice.
This reſervoir, and the juice it contained, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
increaſed. In examining this ſeminal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
with the microſcope, he ſaw nothing in it
but ſmall opaque globules ſwimming in a kind
of ſerous matter, without any appearance of life.
But, ſome time after, he diſcovered, in the milt
of another calmar, organic bodies compleatly
formed, which reſembled ſpiral ſprings, [<hi>a, b,</hi>
Pl. I. fig. 5.] incloſed in a tranſparent caſe.
Theſe ſprings were equally perfect at the firſt
obſervation as afterwards; only they, in time,
contracted themſelves, and formed a kind of
ſcrew. The head of the caſe is a ſpecies of valve
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0195400702:194"/>
which opens outward, and through which every
thing within may be forced out. It contains,
beſides, another valve <hi>b,</hi> a little barrel, <hi>c,</hi> and a
ſpongy ſubſtance <hi>d, e.</hi> Thus the whole machine
conſiſts of an outer, tranſparent, cartilaginous
caſe, <hi>a, fig.</hi> 2. the ſuperior extremity of which
is terminated by a round head, formed by the
caſe itſelf, and performs the office of a valve.
This external caſe contains a tranſparent tube,
which includes the ſpring, a piſton or valve, a
little barrel, and a ſpongy ſubſtance. The ſkrew
occupies the ſuperior part of the tube and caſe,
the piſton and barrel are ſituated in the middle,
and the ſpongy ſubſtance occupies the inferior
part. Theſe machines pump the liquor of the
milt; the ſpongy ſubſtance is full of this liquor;
and, before the animal ſpawns, the whole milt
is only a congeries of theſe organic bodies, which
have abſolutely pumped up and dried the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
liquor. Whenever theſe ſmall machines are
taken from the body of the animal, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
water, or expoſed to the air, they begin to
act [Pl. V. fig. 2. and 3.]; the ſpring mounts
up, and is followed by the piſton, the barrel, and
the ſpongy ſubſtance which contains the liquor:
And, as ſoon as the ſpring and the tube in which
it is contained begin to iſſue out of the caſe, the
ſpring plaits, and the whole internal apparatus
moves, till the ſpring, the piſton, and the barrel
have entirely eſcaped from the caſe. When
this is effected, all the reſt inſtantly follow, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0195400702:195"/>
the milty liquor, which had been pumped, and
was confined in the ſpongy ſubſtance, runs out
through the barrel.</p>
                  <p>As this phaenomenon is extremely ſingular,
and inconteſtibly proves that the moving bodies
in the milt of the calmar are not real animals,
but ſimple machines, a ſpecies of pumps, I ſhall
here tranſcribe Mr Needham's own account of
the matter:</p>
                  <p>'When the ſmall machines<note n="*" place="bottom">Needham's New Diſcoveries made with the Microſcope, ch. 6. p. 53.</note>,' ſays he, 'have
come to their full maturity, ſeveral of them act
as ſoon as they are expoſed to the air. Moſt
of them, however, may be commodiouſly
viewed by the microſcope before their action
commences; and, even before they act, it is
neceſſary to moiſten with a drop of water the
ſuperior extremity of the external caſe, which
then begins to expand, while the two ſlender
ligaments that iſſue out of the caſe are twiſted
and contorted in different ways. At the ſame
time, the ſcrew riſes ſlowly, and the ſpirals at
its ſuperior end approach each other, and act
againſt the top of the caſe, thoſe which are
lower ſeeming to be continually followed by
others that iſſue from the piſton; I ſay, that
they <hi>ſeem</hi> to follow; becauſe I believe it to be
only a deception produced by the motion of
the ſcrew. The piſton and barrel likewiſe
move in the ſame direction; and the inferior
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0195400702:196"/>
part, which contains the ſemen, extends in
length, and, at the ſame time, moves towards
the top of the caſe, which is apparent by the
vacuity left at the bottom. As ſoon as the
ſcrew, with the tube in which it is incloſed,
begins to appear out of the caſe, it twiſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is conſtrained by the two ligaments.
The whole internal apparatus continues to
move gradually and ſlowly till the ſcrew, the
piſton, and the barrel, have entirely eſcaped.
When that happens, the remainder iſſues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly.
The piſton, <hi>b</hi> [Pl. V. fig. 2.].
ſeparates from the barrel <hi>a</hi>; the ligament,
which is under the barrel, ſwells and acquires
a diameter equal to that of the ſpongy part
which ſucceeds it: This, though much broader
than when in the caſe, becomes alſo five times
longer than formerly. The tube, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the whole, contracts in the middle, and
forms two knots or joints, <hi>d, e,</hi> [Pl. V. fig. 2.
and 3.], diſtant about one third of its length
from each extremity. Then the ſemen eſcapes
by the barrel <hi>e,</hi> [fig. 2.]. It is compoſed of
ſmall opaque globules, which ſwim in a ſerous
matter, without diſcovering any ſigns of life,
and are preciſely the ſame as I perceived them
to be when diffuſed through the reſervoir of
the milt. In the figure, the part comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between the two joints <hi>d, e,</hi> appear to be
fringed. When examined attentively, this
appearance ſeems to be occaſioned by the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0195400702:197"/>
ſubſtance within the tube being broken and
divided into portions nearly equal. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
phaenomena will clearly prove that
this is the caſe.'</p>
                  <p>'It ſometimes happens, that the ſcrew and
the tube break preciſely above the piſton <hi>b,</hi>
which remains in the barrel <hi>e,</hi> [fig. 3.]. Then
the tube inſtantly ſhuts; and, by contracting,
aſſumes a conical figure above the extremity of
the ſcrew, <hi>f.</hi> This is a demonſtration that it
is there very elaſtic; and the manner in which
it accommodates its figure to that of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which includes it, when the latter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes
the ſmalleſt change, proves that it is
every where equally elaſtic.'</p>
                  <p>M. Needham hence concludes, that it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to imagine that the total action of this
machine is occaſioned by the ſpring of the ſcrew.
But, unfortunately, he proves, by ſeveral expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
that the ſcrew is acted upon by a power
reſiding in the ſpongy part: As ſoon as the
ſcrew is ſeparated from the reſt of the machine,
it ceaſes to act, and loſes all motion. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
draws the following concluſion from this
ſingular phaenomenon.</p>
                  <p>'If I had ſeen,' ſays he, 'theſe pretended ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcules
in the ſemen of living animals, I ſhould,
perhaps, have been able to aſcertain whether
they are really animated beings, or only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly
ſmall machines, which correſpond in
miniature to the larger veſſels of the calmar.'</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:0195400702:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0195400702:199"/>
From this and other analogies, Mr Needham
concludes, that the ſpermatic worms of other
animals, it is reaſonable to think, are only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
bodies; a ſpecies of machines ſimilar to
thoſe of the calmar, which act at different times;
for, ſays he, if we ſuppoſe that, of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
number of ſpermatic animalcules which
appear in the field of the microſcope, only a few
thouſands act at a time, this will be ſufficient to
make us believe the whole to be alive. If it be
farther ſuppoſed, he adds, that the motion of
each animalcule laſts, like that of the calmar
machines, about half a minute; in this caſe, the
ſucceſſive action of the ſmall machines would
continue for a conſiderable time, and the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcules
would die one after another. Beſides,
why ſhould the ſemen of the calmar alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
machines, while that of all other animals
contain real living animalcules? Here the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
is ſo ſtrong as to be almoſt irreſiſtible. Mr
Needham farther remarks, that even Leeuwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoek's
experiments ſeem to indicate that the
ſpermatic animals have a great reſemblance to the
organic bodies in the ſemen of the calmar.
Speaking of the ſemen of the cod, Leeuwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoek
remarks, that he imagined the oval bodies
to be animalcules burſt and diſtended, becauſe
they were four times larger than when alive.
And, in another place, he obſerves of the ſemen
of the dog, that the animalcules often changed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0195400702:200"/>
their figure, eſpecially when the liquor began to
evaporate<note n="*" place="bottom">See Leeuwenh. Arc. nat. p. 306. 309. and 319.</note>.</p>
                  <p>On all theſe accounts, Mr Needham conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
that the pretended ſpermatic animals were
only a kind of natural machines, bodies much
more ſimply organized than thoſe of real ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
I examined the machines of the calmar
along with him, and the reader may be aſſured
that his deſcription of them is both exact and
faithful. His experiments, therefore, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
that the ſeminal fluid conſiſts of particles
in queſt of organization; that, in fact, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
organized bodies; but that theſe bodies are
not animals, nor ſimilar to the individual which
produces them. It is, indeed, probable, that
theſe organized bodies are only a kind of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for perfecting the ſemen, and beſtowing
on it an active force; and that it is by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
action that they intimately penetrate the
ſeminal fluid of the female.</p>

figure of the animalcules: And, with regard to

In another letter to the Royal Society, dated

               <p>I have tranſcribed theſe paſſages from the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
Tranſactions, becauſe they firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in that work, before Leeuwenhoek had
formed any theory; and, therefore, they muſt
be more agreeable to truth. After the ingenious
author had formed a ſyſtem of generation, his
account of the ſpermatic animals varies, even in
matters that are eſſential<note n="*" place="bottom">Here the author attempts a formal proof that Leeuwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoek invented the ſingle microſcope, and the exiſtence of ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic animals, before Hartſoeker, which interrupts the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is noways intereſting to the reader, and is here omitted in the tranſlation.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, what he ſays concerning the
number of theſe pretended animalcules is true;
but the figure of their bodies correſponds not
always to his deſcription. Sometimes the end
next the tail is globular and ſometimes cylindri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0195400702:208"/>
ſometimes it is flat, and at other times it is
broader than long, &amp;c. With regard to the
tail, it is often thicker and ſhorter than
he makes it. The vibratory motion, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
to the tail, and by which he alledges
the animals are enabled to proceed forward, I
never could diſtinguiſh in the manner he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
it. I have ſeen theſe moving bodies vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
eight or ten times, from right to left, or from
left to right, without advancing the breadth of a
ſingle hair; and I have obſerved many of them
which never could proceed forward, becauſe this
tail, in place of aſſiſting them to ſwim, was, on
the contrary, a ſmall thread attached to the fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or mucilaginous part of the liquor, and,
of courſe, totally prevented the progreſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the body. Even when the tail appeared
to have any motion, it only reſembled the ſmall
bendings of a thread at the end of a vibration.
I have ſeen theſe threads or tails fixed to the
filaments, which Leeuwenhoek calls veſſels:
I have ſeen them ſeparate from the fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
after repeated efforts made by the moving
bodies; I have ſeen them firſt long, then dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and at laſt diſappear. Thus theſe tails
ought to be regarded as accidental appendages,
and not as real members of the moving bodies.
But, what is more remarkable, Leeuwenhoek
expreſsly affirms, in this letter to Lord Brouncker,
that, beſides the tailed animals, he obſerved in
this liquor animalcules ſtill more minute that
had no tails, and were perfectly globular: 'His
<pb facs="tcp:0195400702:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <figure>
                     <head>Plate VIII.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0195400702:210"/>
animalculis (caudatis ſcilicet) minora adhuc
animalcula, quibus non niſi globuli ſiguram
attribuere poſſum, permiſta erant.' This is the
truth. After Leeuwenhoek, however, had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that theſe animalcules were the only effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
principle of generation, and that they were
transformed into men, he regards as real animals
only thoſe which had tails; and, accordingly, as
it was neceſſary that animalcules, to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into men, ſhould have a conſtant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable
figure, he never afterwards mentions
the round animals without tails. I was ſtruck
with the difference between the original compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of this letter, and the form in which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
twenty years afterwards in his third vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume:
For, inſtead of the words which we have
juſt now quoted, we meet with the following in
pag. 63. 'Animalculis hiſce permiſtae jacebant
aliae minutiores particulae, quibus non aliam
quam globulorum ſeu ſphaericam figuram aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignare
queo.' This is a very different account
of the matter. A particle of matter, to which he
aſcribes no motion, is extremely different from
an animalcule. It is aſtoniſhing that Leeuwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoek,
in copying his own letter, ſhould have
changed an article of ſo much conſequence.
What he immediately ſubjoins likewiſe merits
attention. He ſays, that, at the intreaty of Mr
Oldenburg, he had examined this liquor three
or four years ago; and that he then imagined
theſe animalcules to be globules. Thus, theſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0195400702:211"/>
pretended animalcules are ſometimes globules
without any ſenſible motion; ſometimes they are
globules which move with great activity; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they have tails, and ſometimes no tails.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is worthy of remark, that Leeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenhoek
had very early diſcovered the filaments

framed his hypotheſis concerning the ſpermatic
animals, he conceived the filaments to be veins,
nerves, and arteries. He firmly believed, that
all the parts and veſſels of the human body
might be clearly diſtinguiſhed in the ſeminal
fluid. He even perſiſted in this opinion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the repreſentations made to him by
Mr Oldenburg, in name of the Royal Society.
But, after he conceived the notion of transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his spermatic animals into men, he never
again takes any notice of theſe veſſels. Inſtead
of regarding them as the nerves and blood-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0195400702:212"/>
of the human body already formed in the
ſemen, he does not even aſcribe to them their
real function, which is the production of the
moving bodies. He obſerves<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 1. p. 7.</note>, 'Quid fiet de
omnibus illis particulis ſeu corpuſculis praeter
illa animalcula ſemini virili hominum inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentibus!
Olim et priuſquam haec ſcriberem,
in ea ſententia fui praedictas ſtrias vel vaſa ex
teſticulis principlum ſecum ducere,' &amp;c. And,
in another place, he ſays, that what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
remarked concerning veſſels in the ſemen
deſerved no attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we compare the figures 1. 2. 3. and 4.
Pl. VI. and VII. which we have repreſented exactly
as they appear in the Philoſophical Tranſactions,
with thoſe which Leeuwenhoek cauſed to be
engraved ſeveral years after, we ſhall find very
great differences, eſpecially in thoſe of the dead
animalcules of the rabbit, 1. 3. and 4. and in
thoſe of the dog, which I have alſo delineated,
in order to give a diſtinct idea of the matter.
From all this, it may fairly be concluded, that
Leeuwenhoek has not always ſeen the ſame
phaenomena; that the moving bodies, which he
regards as animals, have appeared to him under
different forms; and that he has contradicted
himſelf with a view to make the ſpecies of men
and of animals uniform and conſiſtent. He not
only varies as to the fundamental part of theſe
experiments, but alſo as to the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0195400702:213"/>
them; for he expreſsly tells us, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
diluted the ſemen with water, to ſeparate
its parts, and to give more freedom of motion to
the animalcules<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 3. p. 92. 93.</note>; and yet, in his firſt letter to
Lord Brouncker, he ſays, that, when he mixed
the ſemen of dogs, in which he before had ſeen
innumerable animals, with water, they all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
died. Thus Leeuwenhoek's firſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were made, like mine, without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and, it appears, that he was not in uſe to
mix the liquor with water till long after he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his experiments, and till he conceived the
idea of water's killing the animalcules; which,
however, is not true: I imagine that the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of water only diſſolves the filaments too
ſuddenly; for, in all my experiments, I have
ſeen but very few filaments in the liquor, after
its being mixed with water.</p>
               <p>Leeuwenhoek was no ſooner perſuaded that
the ſpermatic animalcules were transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men and other animals, than he imagined that
he ſaw two diſtinct kinds in the ſemen of every
animal, the one male, and the other female.
Without this difference of ſex in the ſpermatic
animalcules, it was difficult, he ſays, to conceive
the poſſibility of producing males and females by
ſimple transformation. He mentions theſe male
and female animalcules in his letter publiſhed in
the Philoſophical Tranſactions, No. 145. and in
ſeveral other places<note n="†" place="bottom">See tom. 1. p. 163. and tom. 3. p. 101. of his works.</note>. But he attempts not to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0195400702:214"/>
deſcribe the differences between male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
animalcules, which never exiſted but in
his own imagination.</p>
               <p>The famous Boerhaave having aſked Leeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenhoek,
whether he had obſerved any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in the growth and ſize of ſpermatic ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals?
Leeuwenhoek replied, that, in the ſemen
of a rabbit which he had opened, he ſaw an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of animalcules: 'Incredibilem,'
ſays he, 'viventium animalculorum numerum
conſpexerunt, cum haec animalcula ſcypho
impoſita vitreo et illic emortua, in rariores or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
diſparaſſent, et per continuos aliquot dies
ſaepius viſu examinaſſem, quaedam ad juſtam
magnitudinem nondum excreviſſe adverti. Ad
haec quaſdam obſervavi particulas perexiles et
oblongas, alias aliis majores, et, quantum ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
apparebat, cauda deſtitutas; quas quidem
particulas non niſi animalcula eſſe credidi, quae
ad juſtam magnitudinem non excreviſſent<note n="*" place="bottom">See tom. 4. p. 280. 281.</note>.'
Here we have animalcules of different ſizes, and
ſome with tails, and others that had no tails,
which better correſponds with my experiments
than with Leeuwenhoek's ſyſtem. We only
differ in a ſingle article. He conſiders the oblong
bodies without tails as young animalcules which
have not yet arrived at their full growth: But I,
on the contrary, have ſeen theſe pretended ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
originally ſpring from the filaments with
their tails or threads, which they gradually loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0195400702:215"/>
In the ſame letter to Boerhaave he ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 4. p. 28.</note>, that,
in the ſemen of a ram he obſerved the animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules
marching in flocks like ſheep: 'A tribus
circiter annis teſtes arietis, adhuc calentes, ad
aedes meas deferri curaveram; cum igitur ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriam
ex epididymibus eductam, ope micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopii
contemplarer, non ſine ingenti voluptate
advertebam animalcula omnia, quotquot inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabant
ſemini maſculino, eundem natando cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
tenere, ita nimirum ut quo itinere priora
praenatarent, eodem poſteriora ſubſequerentur,
adeo ut hiſce animalculis quaſi ſit ingenitum,
quod oves factitare videmus, ſcilicet ut praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentium
veſtigiis grex univerſus incedat.' This
obſervation, made by Leeuwenhoek in the 1713,
and which he regarded as new and ſingular, is a
ſufficient proof that he had never ſo attentively
examined the ſeminal fluids of animals as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
him to give exact deſcriptions of them. In
the 1713, he was 71 years of age: He had been
in the conſtant practice of making experiments
with the microſcope for 45 years: He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to publiſh his obſervations during 36 years:
And yet, after all this practice, he now, for the
firſt time, obſerved a phaenomenon which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in every ſemen, and which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
Exper. IX. in the human ſemen, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
XII. in the ſemen of a dog, and Exper.
XXIX in the ſemen of a bitch. To explain the
moving of the animalcules of the ram in flocks,
<pb facs="tcp:0195400702:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <figure>
                     <head>Plate IX.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0195400702:217"/>
therefore, it is unneceſſary to ſuppoſe them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with the natural inſtinct peculiar to ſheep;
ſince thoſe of man, of the dog, and of the bitch,
move in the very ſame manner; and ſince this
motion depends upon particular circumſtances,
the principal of which is, that the fluid part of
the ſemen ſhould be on one ſide, and the thick
or filamentous part on the other; for then the
whole moving bodies diſengage themſelves from
the filaments, and proceed, in the ſame direction,
into the more fluid part of the liquor.</p>
               <p>In another letter, written the ſame year, and
addreſſed to Boerhaave<note n="*" place="bottom">See tom. 4. p. 304.</note>, he relates ſome farther
obſervations concerning the ſemen of the ram:
He tells us, that, when the liquor was put into
ſeparate glaſſes and examined, he obſerved flocks
of animalcules moving all in the ſame direction,
and other flocks returning the contrary way.
He adds: 'Neque illud in unica epididymum
parte, ſed et in aliis quas praecideram partibus,
obſervavi. Ad haec, in quadam paraſtatarum
reſecta portione complura vidi animalcula, quae
necdum in juſtam magnitudinem adoleverant;
nam et corpuſcula illis exiliora et caudae triplo
breviores erant quam adultis. Ad haec, caudas
non habebant deſinentes in mucronem, quales
tamen adultis eſſe paſſim comperio. Practerea,
in quandam paraſtatarum portionem incidi, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalculis,
quantum diſcernere potui, deſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,
tantum illi quaedam perexiguae inerant
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0195400702:218"/>
particulae, partim longiores partim breviores;
ſed altera ſui extremitate craſſiunculae; iſtas
particulas in animalcula tranſituras eſſe non du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitabam.'
From this paſſage, it is apparent that
Leeuwenhoek had ſeen in this ſeminal liquor,
what I have found in the ſemen of all the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
which I examined, moving bodies that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſize, figure, and motion; and theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
it is obvious, correſpond better with
the notion of organic particles in motion, than
with that of real animals.</p>
               <p>It appears, therefore, that Leeuwenhoek's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
though he draws very different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
from them, perfectly correſpond with
mine: And, though there be ſome oppoſition in
the facts, I am fully perſuaded, that, whoever
ſhall take the trouble of repeating the experiments,
will eaſily diſcover the ſource of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and find that I have related nothing but
truth. To enable the reader to decide in this
matter, I ſhall add a few remarks.</p>
               <p>We do not always ſee, in the human ſemen,
the filaments I have mentioned: For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
the liquor muſt be examined the moment
it is extracted from the body; and even then
they do not uniformly appear. When the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is too thick, it preſents nothing but large
globules, which may be diſtinguiſhed with a
common lens. When examined with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope
they have the appearance of ſmall oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
they are very opaque, and one of them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0195400702:219"/>
the whole field of the microſcope. The
firſt time I obſerved theſe globules, I imagined
them to be foreign bodies which had fallen into
the liquor. But, after examining different drops,
I found that the whole liquor was compoſed of
theſe large globules. I obſerved one of the
largeſt and roundeſt of them for a long time.
At firſt it was perfectly opaque: A little after,
I perceived on its ſurface, about half way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the centre and circumference, a beautiful
coloured luminous ring, which continued more
than half an hour, then gradually approached
the centre, which became clear and coloured,
while the reſt of the globule remained opaque.
This light which illuminated the centre, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
that which appears in large air-bubbles.
The globule now began to grow flat, and to
have a ſmall degree of tranſparency: And, after
obſerving it for three hours, I could perceive no
other change, no appearance of motion, either
internal or external. I imagined that ſome change
might happen by mixing the liquor with water.
The globules were indeed changed into a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
homogeneous fluid, which preſented no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worthy of remark. I left the ſemen to
liquify of its own accord, and examined it at the
diſtance of 6, 12, and 24 hours; but found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like life or motion. I relate this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to ſhow, that the ordinary phaenomena
are not always to be expected in ſeminal fluids,
though they be apparently ſimilar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0195400702:220"/>
Sometimes all the moving bodies have tails,
eſpecially in the ſemen of man, and of the dog;
their motion is not then very rapid, and appears
to be performed with difficulty. If the liquor
be allowed to dry, the tails or threads are firſt
deprived of motion; the anterior extremity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to vibrate for ſome time, and then all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ceaſes. Theſe bodies may be long preſerved
in this ſtate; and, if a ſmall drop of water be then
poured upon them, their figure changes; they
fall down into ſeveral minute globules, which
appear to have a ſmall degree of motion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
approaching each other, and ſometimes
trembling, and turning round their centres.</p>
               <p>The moving bodies in the human ſemen, and
in thoſe of the dog and bitch, reſemble each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo ſtrongly, that it is not eaſy to diſtinguiſh
them, eſpecially when examined immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they are taken from the body of the animal.
Thoſe of the rabbit appear to be ſmaller and
more active. But theſe differences and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
proceed more from the different ſtates
of the fluids during the time of examination,
than from the nature of the fluids themſelves,
which ought indeed to be different in different
ſpecies of animals: For example, in the human
fluid, I have remarked large filaments, as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
in Pl. 1. fig. 3. &amp;c. and I have ſeen the
moving bodies ſeparate from theſe filaments,
from which they appeared to derive their origin.
But I could perceive nothing of this kind in the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0195400702:221"/>
ſemen of the dog. In place of diſtinct filaments,
it is generally compoſed of a compact mucilage,
in which we with difficulty perceive ſome fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
parts; and yet this mucilage gives
birth to moving bodies ſimilar to thoſe in the
human ſemen.</p>
               <p>The motion of theſe bodies continues longer
in the fluid of the dog, than in that of man,
which enables us more eaſily to diſtinguiſh the
change of form above taken notice of. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the fluid iſſues from the body of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
we find moſt of the animalcules poſſeſſed
of tails. In 12, 24, or 36 hours afterwards, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
the whole tails diſappear; we then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
only oval bodies moving about, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
with more rapidity than at firſt.</p>
               <p>The moving bodies are always below the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the liquor. Several large tranſparent
air-bubbles commonly appear on the ſurface;
but they have no motion, unleſs when the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is agitated. Below the moving bodies we
often perceive others ſtill more minute: Theſe
have no tails; but moſt of them move: And, in
general, I have remarked, that, of the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
globules in all theſe liquors, the ſmalleſt are
generally blacker and more obſcure than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and that thoſe which are extremely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
and tranſparent have little or no motion.
They ſeem likewiſe to have more ſpecific gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for they are always ſunk deepeſt in the
fluid.</p>

               <head>Reflections on the preceding Experiments.</head>
               <p>FROM the foregoing experiments, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that females, as well as males, have
a ſeminal fluid containing bodies in motion;
that theſe moving bodies are not real animals,
but only organic living particles; and that theſe
particles exiſt not only in the ſeminal fluids of
both ſexes, but in the fleſh of animals, and in
the ſeeds of vegetables. To diſcover whether
all the parts of animals and all the ſeeds of plants
contained moving organic particles, I made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions
of the fleſh of different animals, and of
the ſeeds of more than twenty different ſpecies
of vegetables; and, after remaining ſome days in
cloſe glaſſes, I had the pleaſure of ſeeing organic
moving particles in all of them. In ſome they
appeared ſooner, in others later. Some preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their motion for months, and others ſoon
loſt it. Some, at firſt, produced large moving
globules, reſembling animals, which changed
their figure, ſplit, and became gradually ſmaller.
Others produced only ſmall globules whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were extremely rapid; and others produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0195400702:223"/>
filaments, which grew longer, ſeemed to vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
and then ſwelled, and poured out torrents
of moving globules. But it is needleſs to give
a detail of my experiments on the infuſions of
plants, eſpecially ſince Mr Needham has publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his excellent and numerous obſervations on
this ſubject. To this able naturaliſt I have read
over the preceding treatiſe; I have often rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
with him on the reſemblance between the
moving bodies in infuſions of the ſeeds of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
and thoſe in the ſeminal fluids of male
and female animals. He thought my views well
founded, and of ſufficient importance to merit a
farther diſcuſſion. He, therefore, began to
make experiments on the different parts of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables;
and I acknowledge, that he has brought
the ideas I communicated to greater perfection,
than could have been done by me. Of this I
could give many examples: But I ſhall confine
myſelf to one, becauſe I formerly pointed out
the fact in queſtion, which he deſcribes in the
following manner.</p>
               <p>To aſcertain whether the moving bodies which
appear in infuſions of fleſh were real animals,
or only, as I had imagined, organic moving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
Mr Needham thought that an examination
of the jelly of roaſted meat would determine the
queſtion; becauſe, if they were animals, the fire
would deſtroy them, and, if not, they would
ſtill be perceptible, in the ſame manner as when
the fleſh was raw. Having, for this purpoſe, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0195400702:224"/>
the jellies of veal and of other kinds of roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
meat, he put them in glaſſes filled with water,
and carefully corked the bottles. After ſome days
infuſion, he found in the whole of the liquors
an immenſe number of moving bodies. He
ſhowed me ſeveral of theſe infuſions, and, among
others, that of the veal jelly, which contained
moving bodies very ſimilar to thoſe of man, the
dog, and the bitch, after they had loſt their tails
or threads. Though they changed their forms,
their motions were ſo ſimilar to thoſe of animals
ſwimming, that, whoever ſaw them for the firſt
time, or had been ignorant of what has been
formerly remarked concerning them, would
certainly have apprehended them to be real ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
I ſhall only add, that Mr Needham has
eſtabliſhed, by numberleſs experiment, the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of moving organic particles in all the
parts of vegetables, which confirms what I have
alledged, and extends my theory concerning the
compoſition and reproduction of organized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>It is them apparent, that all animals, whether
male or female, and every ſpecies of vegetable,
are compoſed of living organic particles. Theſe
organic particles abound moſt in the ſeminal fluids
of animals, and in the ſeeds of vegetables. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>production
is effected by the union of theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles, which are detached from all
parts of the animal or vegetable body, and are
always ſimilar to the particular ſpecies to which
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0195400702:225"/>
they belong; for their union could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
but by the intervention of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mould, which is the efficient cauſe of the
figure of the animal or vegetable, and in which
the eſſence, the unity, and the continuation of
the ſpecies conſiſts, and will invariably continue
till the end of time.</p>
               <p>But, before drawing general concluſions from
the ſyſtem I have eſtabliſhed, ſome objections
muſt be removed, which will contribute ſtill
farther to illuſtrate the ſubject.</p>
               <p>It will be demanded of me, why I deny theſe
moving bodies to be animals, after they have
uniformly been recognized as ſuch by every man
who has examined them? It may likewiſe
be aſked, How is it poſſible to conceive the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of living organic particles, unleſs we allow
them to be real animals? And to ſuppoſe an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
to be compoſed of leſſer animals, is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſame idea, as when we ſay, that an orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
body is compoſed of organic living par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.
To theſe queſtions, I ſhall endeavour to
give ſatisfactory anſwers.</p>
               <p>It is true, that almoſt all obſervers agree in
regarding the moving bodies in the ſeminal fluid
as real animals. But it is equally certain, both
from my experiments, and thoſe of Mr Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
upon the ſemen of the calmar, that theſe
moving bodies are beings more ſimple and leſs
organized than animals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0195400702:226"/>
The word <hi>animal,</hi> in its common acceptation,
repreſents a general idea, compoſed of particular
ideas which we derive from particular animals.
All general ideas include many different ideas,
which more or leſs approach or recede from one
another; and, of courſe, no general idea can
be preciſe or exact. The general idea we have
formed of an animal, may be derived from the
particular idea of a dog, of a horſe, and of other
animals, from the power of volition, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
them to act according to their inclination,
and from the circumſtances of their being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of fleſh and blood, from their faculty of
chuſing and of taking nouriſhment, from their
ſenſes, from the diſtinction of ſexes, and from
their power of reproducing. The general idea,
therefore, expreſſed by the word <hi>animal,</hi> includes
a number of particular ideas, not one of which
conſtitutes the eſſence of the general idea: For
there are animals which have no intelligence,
no will, no progreſſive motion, no fleſh or blood,
and appear to be only a maſs of congealed mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage:
There are others, which cannot ſeek for
their food, and only receive it from the element
in which they exiſt; others have no ſenſes, not
even that of feeling, at leaſt in a perceptible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
Some have no ſexes, or have both in
one individual. There remains nothing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in the properties of an animal, but the
power of reproduction, which is common to
both the vegetable and animal. It is from the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0195400702:227"/>
whole taken together that a general idea is
formed; and, as this whole is compoſed of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
parts, there muſt of neceſſity be degrees
or intervals between theſe parts. An inſect, in
this ſenſe, is leſs an animal than a dog, an oyſter
than an inſect, and a ſea-nettle, or a freſh water
polype, than an oyſter: And, as Nature proceeds
by inſenſible degrees, we ſhould find beings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of ſtill leſs animation than a ſea-nettle or
a polype. Our general ideas are only artificial
methods of collecting a number of objects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one point of view; and they have, like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
artificial methods, the defect of not being
able to comprehend the whole. They are in
direct oppoſition to the procedure of Nature,
which is uniform, inſenſible, and always parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
It is to graſp a number of particular
ideas under one word, of which we have no
clearer notion than that word conveys; becauſe,
when the word is once received, we imagine it
to be a line drawn between the different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of nature; that every thing above this
line is an <hi>animal,</hi> and every thing below it a <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,</hi>
which is another word equally general,
and employed as a line of ſeparation between
organized bodies and brute matter. But, as has
already been remarked, theſe lines of ſeparation
have no exiſtence in nature. There are bodies
which are neither animals, vegetables, nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
and every attempt to arrange them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
either of theſe claſſes muſt be ineffectual.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0195400702:228"/>
For example, Mr Trembly, when he firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the freſh water polypus, ſpent much
time before he could determine whether it was
an animal or a vegetable. The reaſon is plain;
this polypus is perhaps neither the one nor the
other; and all that can be ſaid is, that it has
moſt reſemblance to an animal: And, as we are
inclined to think, that every living being is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an animal or a plant, we believe not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of any organized body, unleſs it falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſome of theſe general denominations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there muſt be, and in fact there are,
many beings which belong neither to the one
nor the other. The moving bodies found in
the ſeminal fluids, and in infuſions of the fleſh
of animals, as well as in thoſe of all parts of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
are of this ſpecies: We can neither
rank them under animals nor vegetables; and
no man in his ſenſes will ever maintain them to
be minerals.</p>
               <p>We may, therefore, pronounce, without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that the great diviſion of natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
into <hi>animals, vegetables,</hi> and <hi>minerals,</hi>
comprehends not all material beings; ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
exiſt which can be included in neither of
theſe claſſes. Nature paſſes, by imperceptible
ſteps, from the animal to the vegetable; but,
from the vegetable to the mineral, the paſſage is
ſudden, and the interval great. Here the law
of imperceptible degrees ſuffers a violation. This
circumſtance made me ſuſpect, that, by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0195400702:229"/>
Nature more cloſely, we ſhould find inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
organized beings, which, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the faculty of reproduction, like animals
and vegetables, would ſtill enjoy a ſpecies of life
and motion; beings which, without being either
animals or vegetables, might enter into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of both; and, laſtly, beings which
would conſiſt of the firſt aſſemblages of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles mentioned in the preceding
chapters.</p>
               <p>Eggs conſtitute the firſt claſs of this ſpecies of
beings. Thoſe of hens and other female birds
are attached to a common pedicle, and derive
their nouriſhment and growth from the body
of the animal. But, when attached to the ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,
they are not properly eggs; they are only
yellow globes, which ſeparate from the ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
as ſoon as they acquire a certain magnitude:
Such is their internal organization, however,
that they abſorb nouriſhment from the lymph
contained in the uterus, and convert it into the
white, membranes, and ſhell. Thus the egg poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
a ſpecies of life and organization. It grows
and aſſumes a form by its own peculiar powers:
It neither lives like an animal, nor vegetates like
a plant, nor enjoys the faculty of reproduction.
The egg, therefore, is a diſtinct being, which
can neither be ranked with the animal nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
kingdoms. If it be alledged, that the egg
is only an animal production deſtined for the
nouriſhment of the chick, and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0195400702:230"/>
as a part of the hen; I reply, that eggs,
whether impregnated or not, are always organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in the ſame manner; that impregnation
changes only a part which is almoſt inviſible;
that it grows, and acquires a uniform figure and
ſtructure, both externally and internally, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
of impregnation; and, conſequently,
it ought to be conſidered as a ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
being.</p>
               <p>This will be ſtill more apparent, if we attend
to the growth and formation of the eggs of
fiſhes. When the female depoſits them in the
water, they are properly but the rudiments of
eggs, which, being lately ſeparated from the
body of the animal, attract and aſſimilate thoſe
particles that are fitted for their nouriſhment;
and thus increaſe in ſize by mere abſorption.
In the ſame manner as the egg of the hen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
its white and membranes while floating
in the uterus, the eggs of fiſhes acquire their
white and membranes in the water; and,
whether they are fecundated by the male's
ſhedding his milt upon them, or they remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impregnated,
they ſtill arrive at full perfection.
It is plain, therefore, that eggs in general ought
to be regarded as organized bodies, and forming
a diſtinct genus from animals and vegetables.</p>
               <p>The organized bodies found in the ſemen of
all animals, and which, like thoſe in the milt of
the calmar, are natural machines, and not ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
form a ſecond ſpecies of the ſame genus.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0195400702:231"/>
They are properly the firſt aſſemblages of thoſe
organic particles ſo often mentioned; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
they are the conſtituent particles of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
bodies. They appear in the ſemen of
every animals, becauſe the ſemen is only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue
of the organic particles which the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
takes in with its food. The particles, as
formerly remarked, aſſimilated from the food,
are thoſe which are moſt organized, and the
moſt analogous to the animal itſelf: It is of
theſe particles that the ſemen conſiſts; and, of
courſe, we ought not to be ſurpriſed to find or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
bodies in that fluid.</p>
               <p>To be ſatisfied that theſe organized bodies are
not real animals, we have only to reflect upon
the preceding experiments. The moving bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in the ſemen have been conſidered as real
animals, becauſe they have a progreſſive motion,
and ſomething ſimilar to tails. But, after attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
on the one hand, to the nature of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is ſuddenly finiſhed, and never again
commences, and, on the other, to the nature of
the tails, which are only threads adhering to the
moving body, we will begin to heſitate; for an
animal goes ſometimes ſlow, and ſometimes faſt;
and it ſometimes ſtops, and repoſes, without
moving at all. Theſe moving bodies, on the
contrary, go always in the ſame direction at the
ſame time; I never ſaw them ſtop and again
begin to move; and, if they once ſtop, it is for
ever. I demand, if this continued motion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0195400702:232"/>
any repoſe, is common to animals; and if,
from this circumſtance, we ought not to doubt
concerning the real animation of theſe moving
bodies? An animal ſhould always have a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
figure, as well as diſtinct members: But
theſe moving bodies change their figure every
moment; they have no diſtinct members; and
their tails are only adventitious matter, and no
part of the individual. How, then, can they be
eſteemed real animals? In ſeminal liquors, we
ſee ſilaments which ſtretch out, and ſeem to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getate;
then they ſwell and produce moving bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Theſe filaments are, perhaps, of a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
nature; but the moving bodies which proceed
from them cannot be animals; for we have no
example of vegetables giving birth to animals.
Moving bodies are found in all animal and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
ſubſtances promiſcuouſly. They are not
the produce of generation. They have no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of ſpecies. They cannot, therefore, be
either animals or vegetables. As they are to be
met with in every part of animals and of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
but are moſt abundant in their ſeeds, is it
not natural to regard them as the organic living
particles of which animals and vegetables are
compoſed, as particles which, being endowed
with motion, and a ſpecies of life, ought to
produce, by their union, moving and living
beings, and, in this manner, form animals and
vegetables?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0195400702:233"/>
But, to remove every doubt upon this ſubject,
let us attend to the obſervations of others. Can
the active machines diſcovered by Mr Needham
in the milt of the calmar be regarded as animals?
Can we believe that eggs, which are active ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines
of another ſpecies, are alſo animals? If
we examine Leeuwenhoek's repreſentations of
the moving bodies found in many different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
will we not be ſatisfied, at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection,
that they are not animals, ſince none
of them have any members, but are uniformly
either round or oval? If we attend to what this
famous obſerver has remarked concerning the
motion of theſe pretended animals, we muſt be
convinced that he was wrong in regarding them
as real animals, and we will be more and more
confirmed in the opinion, that they are only
organic moving particles. We ſhall give ſome
examples. Leeuwenhoek<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 1. p. 51.</note>, gives the figure of
the moving bodies in the ſeminal fluid of a male
frog. This figure repreſents nothing but a thin,
long body, pointed at one of the extremities.
Let us attend to what he ſays concerning it:
'Uno tempore caput, (that is, the largeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the moving body), craſſius mihi
apparebat alio; plerumque agnoſcebam ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malculum
haud ulterius quam a capite ad
medium corpus, ob caudae tenuitatem, et cum
idem animalculum paulo vehementius move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur
(quod tamen tarde fiebat) quaſi volumine
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0195400702:234"/>
quodam circa caput ferebatur. Corpus fere
carebat motu, cauda tamen in tres quatuorve
flexus volvebatur.' Here we have the change
of figure that I had obſerved, the mucilage
from which the moving bodies with difficulty
diſengage themſelves, the ſlowneſs of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before they eſcape from the mucilage, and,
laſtly, a part of the pretended animal in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
while the other is dead; for, a little after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
he obſerves, 'movebant poſteriorem ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
partem, quae ultima, morti vicinia eſſe
judicabam.' All this is repugnant to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an animal, but exactly correſponds with
my experiments, excepting that I never ſaw the
tail move but in conſequence of an agitation of
the body. Speaking of the ſeminal fluid of the
cod, he ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 52.</note>, 'Non eſt putandum omnia ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcula
in ſemine aſelli contenta uno eodem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
tempore vivere, ſed illa potius tantum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
quae exitui ſeu partui viciniora ſunt, quae
et copioſiori humido innatant prae reliquis vita
carentibus, adhuc in craſſa materia, quam hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
eorum efficit, jacentibus.' If theſe are
animals, why were they not all alive? Why
did thoſe only live which were in the moſt fluid
part of the liquor? Leeuwenhoek did not obſerve,
that the thick part, inſtead of being a humor
produced by the animalcules, is a mucilage
which gives birth to them. If he had diluted
the mucilage with water, he would at once have
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0195400702:235"/>
given life and motion to the whole. The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage
itſelf is often nothing elſe than a maſs of
thoſe bodies, which begin to move as ſoon as
they can diſengage themſelves; and, of courſe,
this thick matter or mucilage, inſtead of being
a humour produced by the animalcules, is only
a congeries of the animals themſelves, or rather,
as formerly remarked, the matter of which they
are formed. Speaking of the ſemen of the
cock, Leeuwenhoek, in his letter to Grew, ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 5.</note>,
'Contemplando materiam (ſeminalem) animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verti
ibidem tantam abundantiam viventium
animalium, ut ea ſtuperem; forma ſeu externa
figura ſua noſtrates anguillas fluviatiles refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebant,
vehementiſſima agitatione movebantur;
quibus tamen ſubſtrati videbantur multi et ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum
exiles globuli, item multae plan-ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
figurae, quibus etiam vita poſſet attribui,
et quidem propter carumdem commotiones;
ſed exiſtimabam omnes haſce commotiones et
agitationes provenire ab animalculis, ſicque
etiam res ſe habebat; attamen ego non opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nione
ſolum, ſed etiam ad veritatem mihi per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadeo
has particulas, planam et ovalem ſigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
habentes, eſſe quaedam animalcula inter
ſe ordine ſuo diſpoſita et mixta, vitaque adhuc
carentia.' Here we have animalcules, in the
ſame ſeminal fluid, of different forms; and I am
convinced, from my own experiments, that, if
Leeuwenhoek had obſerved thoſe oval bodies
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0195400702:236"/>
with attention, he would have perceived that
they moved with their own proper force, and,
conſequently, that they were as much alive as
the others. This change of figure, it is true,
exactly correſponds with what I had obſerved:
But it does not indicate a uniform ſpecies of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals;
for, in the preſent example, if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
having the figure of a ſerpent were genuine
ſpermatic animalcules, each of which was deſtined
to become a cock, and therefore implies a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and invariable organization, what was the
end and deſtination of thoſe of an oval figure?
He, indeed, afterwards remarks, that theſe oval
bodies might be the ſame with the ſerpentine,
if we ſuppoſe them rolled up in a ſpiral manner.
But ſtill, how is it poſſible to conceive that an
animal, with its body in this reſtrained poſture,
ſhould be able to move without extending itſelf?
I, therefore, maintain, that theſe oval bodies
were only the organic particles ſeparated from
their threads or tails, and that the ſerpentine
bodies were the ſame particles which had not
yet been deprived of theſe appendages, as I have
often remarked in other ſeminal fluids.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Leeuwenhoek, who believed all theſe
moving bodies to be real animals, who eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſyſtem upon that foundation, and who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that ſpermatic animalcules were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into men and other animals, now ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to be only natural machines, or moving
organic particles. He never entertained a doubt,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0195400702:237"/>
but that theſe animalcules contained the large
animal in miniature. He remarks<note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 67.</note>, 'Progene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
animalis ex animalculo in ſeminibus maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culinis
omni exceptione major eſt; nam, etiamſi
in animalculo ex ſemine maſculo, unde ortum
eſt, figuram animalis conſpicere nequeamus,
attamen ſatis ſuperque certi eſſe poſſumus
figuram animalis ex qua animal ortum eſt,
in animalculo quod in ſemine maſculo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritur,
concluſam jacere ſive eſſe: Et quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
mihi ſaepius, conſpectis animalculis in
ſemine maſculo animalis, imaginatus fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim
me poſſe dicere, en ibi caput, en ibi
humeros, en ibi femora; attamen cum ne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima
quidem certitudine de iis judicium ferre
potuerim, hucuſque certi quid ſtatuere ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeo,
donec tale animal, cujus ſemina maſcula
tam magna erunt, ut in iis figuram creaturae
ex qua provenit agnoſcere queam, invenire
ſecunda nobis concedat fortuna.' This op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
ſo much deſired by Leeuwenhoek,
happily occurred to Mr Needham. The ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
animals of the calmar are three or four
lines in length, and are viſible without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the microſcope. Their whole parts
and organization are eaſily perceived. But they
are by no means ſmall calmars, as Leeuwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoek
imagined. They are not even animated,
though they have motion, but are only machines,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0195400702:238"/>
which ought to be regarded as the firſt union of
the organic particles.</p>
               <p>Though Leeuwenhoek had not this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of undeceiving himſelf, he had, however,
obſerved other appearances which ought to have
had this effect. He had remarked, for example,
that the ſpermatic animals of the dog<note n="*" place="bottom">See tom. 1. p. 160.</note>, often
changed their figure, eſpecially when the fluid
was nearly evaporated; that, when dead, they
had an opening in the head, which did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
when they were alive; and that the head
was full and round, during the life of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
animal, and flat and ſunk after its death;
Theſe circumſtances ſhould have led him to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate
concerning the real animation of theſe
bodies, and to think that the phaenomena cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded
more with a machine which emptied
itſelf, like that of the calmar, than with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of an animal.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid that the motion of theſe moving
bodies, theſe organic particles, is not ſimilar to
the motion of animals, and that there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
in their movements. Leeuwenhoek, in
tom. 1. p. 168. makes preciſely the ſame remark:
'Quotieſcunque,' ſays he, 'animalcula in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
maſculo animalium fuerim contemplatus,
attamen illa ſe unquam ad quietem contuliſſe,
me nunquam vidiſſe, mihi dicendum eſt, ſi mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
ſat fiuidae ſupereſſet materiae in qua ſeſe
commode movere poterant; at eadem in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuo
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0195400702:239"/>
manent motu, et tempore quo ipſis mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum
appropinquante, motus magis magiſque
deficit, uſquedum nullus prorſus motus in illis
agnoſcendus ſit.' It is difficult to conceive,
that animals ſhould exiſt, which, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their birth to their diſſolution, ſhould
continue to move rapidly, without the ſmalleſt
interval of repoſe; or to imagine that the ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
animals of the dog, which Leeuwenhoek
perceived to be as active on the ſeventh day as
the moment they proceeded from the body of
the dog, ſhould be able, during all this time, to
move with a celerity which no animal on earth
could perſiſt in for a ſingle hour, eſpecially when
the reſiſtence ariſing from the denſity and tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the fluid is taken into conſideration. This
ſpecies of continued motion, on the contrary,
has an exact correſondence to the nature of the
organic particles, which, like artificial machines,
produce their effects by a continued operation,
and ſtop immediately after the end is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
               <p>In the numerous experiments made by Leeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenhoek,
he doubtleſs obſerved ſpermatic animals
without tails. He even mentions them in ſome
places, and endeavours to explain the phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon.
For example, ſpeaking of the ſemen
of the cod, he ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 2. p. 150.</note>, 'Ubi vero ad lactium ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cederem
obſervationem, in iis partibus quas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalcula
eſſe cenſebam, neque vitam neque
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0195400702:240"/>
caudam dignoſcere potui; cujus rei rationem
eſſe exiſtimabam, quod quamdiu animalcula
natando loca ſua perfecte mutare non poſſunt,
tam diu etiam cauda concinne circa corpus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neat
ordinata, quodque ideo ſingula animalcula
rotundum repraeſentent corpuſculum.' It would
have been more ſimple, and more agreeable to
truth, to have ſaid, that the ſpermatic animals of
this fiſh ſometimes have tails, and ſometimes
have none, than to ſuppoſe that the tails were
ſo exactly would round their bodies as to give
them a ſpherical figure. One would be apt to
think, that Leeuwenhoek had never fixed his
eyes upon, or deſcribed any moving but thoſe
which had tails; he has given figures of none
that wanted tails, becauſe, though they moved,
he did not regard them as animals. This is the
reaſon why all Leeuwenhoek's figures of ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
animals are very ſimilar, and all drawn
with tails. When they appeared in any other
form, he thought they were imperfect, or rather
that they were dead. Beſides, it is apparent from
my experiments, that, inſtead of unfolding their
tails, wherever they are placed in circumſtances
proper for ſwimming, as Leeuwenhoek inſiſts,
theſe pretended animals gradually loſe their tails,
in proportion to the rapidity of their motions,
till, at laſt, theſe tails, which are bodies foreign
to the animalcules, or threads which they drag
after them, totally diſappear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0195400702:241"/>
Leeuwenhoek, ſpeaking of the ſpermatic ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
of man<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 3. p. 93.</note>, ſays: 'Aliquando etiam ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverti
inter animalcula particulas quaſdam
minores et ſubrotundas; cum vero ſe ea aliquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
eo modo oculis meis exhibuerint, ut mihi
imaginarer eas exiguis inſtructas eſſe caudis,
cogitare coepi annon hae forte particulae fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
animalcula recens nata; certum enim mihi
eſt ea etiam animalcula per generationem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire,
vel ex mole minuſcula ad adultam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere
quantitatem: Et quis ſeit annon ea
animalcula, ubi moriuntur, aliorum animalcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum
nutritioni atque augmini inſerviant!' It
appears from this paſſage, that Leeuwenhoek had
ſeen, in the human ſemen, animalcules without
tails; and that he is obliged to ſuppoſe them to
be recently born, which is directly the reverſe
of what I have obſerved; for the moving bodies
are never larger than when they ſeparate from
the filaments, which is the period that their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
begins: But, as ſoon as they are fully diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
from the mucilage, they become ſmaller,
and continue to diminiſh till their motion entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ceaſes. With regard to the generation of theſe
animals, which Leeuwenhoek imagines to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
no veſtige of copulation has been diſcerned
by the moſt acute obſervers. It is purely a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
aſſertion, as may be eaſily proved from his
own experiments. He remarks, for example,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0195400702:242"/>
with great propriety, that the milt of the cod<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 3. p. 98.</note>
is gradually filled with ſeminal liquor; and that,
after the fiſh has ſpent this liquor, the milt dries,
and leaves only a flaccid membrane, entirely
deſtitute of every kind of fluid. 'Eo tempore,'
ſays he, 'quo aſellus major lactes ſuos emiſit, rugae
illae, ſeu tortiles lactium partes, uſque adeo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahuntur,
ut nihil praeter pelliculas ſeu membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
eſſe videantur.' How ſhould this dry mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,
which contains neither ſeminal liquor nor
animalcules, produce animalcules of the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
next ſeaſon? If they were produced by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
generation, ſuch a long interruption could
not take place, which, in moſt fiſhes, continues
a whole year. To remove this difficulty, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
remarks: 'Neceſſario ſtatuendum erit,
ut aſellus major ſemen ſuum emiſerit, in lacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
etiamnum multum materiae ſeminalis gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendis
animalculis aptae remanſiſſe, ex qua ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
plura oportet provenire animalcula ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia
quam anno proxime elapſo emiſſa fuerant.'
This ſuppoſition, that part of the ſeminal liquor
remains in the milt for the production of ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
animals the following year, is perfectly
gratuitous, and contrary to obſervation; for the
milt, during this interval, is nothing but a thin
dry membrane. But how will he explain a
phaenomenon that takes place in ſome fiſhes, and
particularly in the calmar, whoſe ſeminal liquors
are not only renewed every year, but even the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0195400702:243"/>
membranes which contain them. Here neither
the milt nor the ſeminal liquor are preſerved till
the ſucceeding year; and, of courſe, their regular
reproduction cannot be aſcribed to generation.
It is, therefore, apparent, that theſe pretended
ſpermatic animals are not multiplied, like other
animals, by generation; and this circumſtance
alone would entitle us to conclude, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
particles in the ſeminal fluid are not real
animals. Leeuwenhoek, though he tells us, in
the paſſage above quoted, that the ſpermatic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
are certainly propagated by generation,
acknowledges, however, in another place<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 1. p. 26.</note>, that
the manner in which theſe ſpermatic animals are
produced, is exceedingly obſcure, and that he
leaves to others the farther elucidation of this
ſubject. 'Perſuadebam mihi,' ſays he, ſpeaking
of the ſpermatic animals of the dormouſe, 'haecce
animalcula ovibus prognaſci, quia diverſa in
orbem jacentia et in ſemet convoluta videbam;
ſed unde, quaeſo, primam illorum originem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivabimus!

articulo generandi maturitatem adeſſe! ſed haec
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0195400702:244"/>
lampada aliis trado.' It is, perhaps, unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to make many remarks on what Leeuwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoek
has here advanced. He ſaw, in the ſemen
of the dormouſe, ſpermatic animals which were
round and without tails; <hi>in ſemet convoluta,</hi>
ſays he, becauſe he always ſuppoſes that they
ought to have tails. He was formerly certain
that theſe animals were propagated by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Here he ſeems to be convinced of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.
But, when he learned, that the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fretters
(<hi>pucerons</hi>) were propagated without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
<note n="*" place="bottom">See tom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. p. 499. et tom. 3. p. 271.</note>, he laid hold of this idea, in order to
explain the generation of ſpermatic animals.
'Quemadmodum,' ſays he, 'animalcula haec
quae pediculorum antea nomine deſignavimus
(the pucerons) dum adhuc in utero materno
latent, jam praedita ſunt materia ſeminali ex
qua ejuſdem generis proditura ſunt animalcula,
pari ratione cogitare licet animalcula in ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
maſculinis ex animalium teſticulis non
migrare, ſeu ejici, quin poſt ſe relinquant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuta
animalcula, aut ſaltem materiam ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
ex qua iterum alia ejuſdem generis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcula
proventura ſunt, idque abſque coitu,
eadem ratione qua ſupradicta animalcula ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerari
obſervavimus.' This ſuppoſition is not
more ſatisfactory than the preceding; for, by
thus comparing the generation of ſpermatic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalcule
with that of the vine-fretter, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
not the reaſon why they are never ſeen in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0195400702:245"/>
the human ſemen till the age of 14 or 15; nor
do we learn whence they proceed, or how they
are yearly renewed in fiſhes, &amp;c. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the efforts of Leeuwenhoek to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
the generation of ſpermatic animals, he
leaves the ſubject in the greateſt obſcurity, where
it probably would have for ever remained, if
we had not diſcovered, by the preceding expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
that they are not animals, but organic
moving particles, contained originally in the
food, and found in vaſt numbers in the ſeminal
liquors of animals, which are the moſt pure and
moſt organic extracts derived from the food.</p>
               <p>Leeuwenhoek acknowledges, that he did not
always find animalcules in the male ſemen; for
example, in that of the cock, which he often
examined, he never but once ſaw the eel-like
animalcules: And, ſome years after, he could
not diſcover theſe eels<note n="*" place="bottom">See tom. 3. p. 370.</note>, but found animalcules
with a large head and a tail, which his drawer
could not perceive. He likewiſe remarks, that,
during one ſeaſon, he could not diſcover living
animals in the ſeminal fluid of the cod<note n="†" place="bottom">Tom. 3. p. 306.</note>. All
theſe diſappointments proceeded from this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
that, though he ſaw moving glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules,
he was unwilling to acknowledge them to
be animals, unleſs they had tails, though it is in
the form of globules that they moſt generally
appear, either in ſeminal fluids, or in infuſions
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0195400702:246"/>
of animal and vegetables ſubſtances. In the
ſame place, he remarks, that, though he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
diſtinctly ſeen the ſpermatic animals of the
cod, he was never able to make his drawer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them: 'Non ſolum,' ſays he, 'ob eximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
eorum exilitatem, ſed etiam quod eorum
corpora adeo eſſent fragilia, ut corpuſcula paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim
dirumperentur; unde factum fuit ut non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſi
raro, nec ſine attentiſſima obſervatione, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverterem
particulas planas atque ovorum
in morem longas, in quibus ex parte caudas
dignoſcere licebat; particulas has oviformes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtimavi
animalcula eſſe dirupta, quod particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae
hae diruptae quadruplo fere viderentur
majores corporibus animalculorum vivorum.'
When an animal, whatever be its ſpecies, dies, it
does not ſuddenly change its form; from being
long like a thread, it does not become round like a
bullet; neither does it become four times as
large after death as before it. Not a ſingle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of what is advanced by Leeuwenhoek, in
this paſſage, has the ſmalleſt correſpondence to
the nature of an animal; but, on the contrary,
the whole agrees with a ſpecies of machines
which, like thoſe of the calmar, burſt and empty
themſelves, after having performed their func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
To purſue this obſervation a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
He tells us, that he has ſeen the ſpermatic
animals of the cod under different forms, 'Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
apparebant animalcula ſphaeram pellucidam
repraeſentantia, and of different ſizes,' 'Haec
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0195400702:247"/>
animalcula minori videbantur mole, quam ubi
eadem antehac in tubo vitreo rotundo exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naveram.'
This is an evident proof, that there
is nothing like a uniform and invariable ſpecies
in theſe animalcules, and, conſequently, that they
are not animals, but only organic moving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
which, by their different combinations,
aſſume various figures and ſizes. Of theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles, vaſt numbers appear in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
and in the reſidue of our food. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which adheres to the teeth, and which, in
healthy perſons, has the ſame ſmell with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
fluid, is only a reſidue of our food. In it
we accordingly find a great quantity of theſe
pretended animals, ſome of which have tails,
and reſemble thoſe of the ſeminal fluid. Mr
Baker has given figures of four ſpecies of them,
which are all a kind of cylinders, ovals, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules,
ſome of them having tails, and others not.
But, after the ſtricteſt examination, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
that none of them are real animals, and
that they are only, like thoſe in the ſemen, the
organic living particles of the food appearing
under different forms. Leeuwenhoek, who
knew not how to account for theſe pretended
animals in the matter adhering to the teeth, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
them to proceed from certain ſpecies of
food, as cheeſe, in which they previouſly exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but they are found among the teeth of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
perſon, whatever kind of food be eaten;
and, beſides, they have no reſemblance to mites,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0195400702:248"/>
or other animalcules which appear in corrupted
cheeſe. In another place, he tells us that theſe
teeth-animals proceed from the ciſtern-water
which we drink, becauſe he obſerved ſimilar ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
in rain-water, eſpecially when it had ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
upon leaden roofs. But, when we give
the hiſtory of microſcopic animals, we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
that moſt of thoſe found in rain-water
are only organic moving particles, which divide,
unite, change their ſize and figure, and, in a word,
which can be made to move or to reſt, to live
or die, as often as we pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Moſt ſeminal fluids ſpontaneouſly dilute, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more liquid, when expoſed to the air, or to
a certain degree of cold, than when they iſſue
from the body. But they thicken upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of a moderate degree of heat. I expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſome of theſe fluids to a degree of cold equal
to that of water juſt beginning to freeze; but the
pretended animalcules ſuffered not the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
from it. They moved with equal activity,
and during the ſame length of time, as thoſe to
which no cold had been applied. But thoſe which
were expoſed to a ſmall degree of heat, ſoon
ceaſed to move, becauſe the liquor thickened.
If thoſe moving bodies were animals, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in their nature and conſtitution from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to whom a moderate degree of heat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
force and motion, and upon whoſe
bodies cold has the very oppoſite effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0195400702:249"/>
Before leaving this ſubject, upon which I
have, perhaps, dwelt too long, I muſt ſtill add
another remark, which may lead to ſome uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
concluſions. Theſe pretended ſpermatic
animals, which are nothing but the organic
living particles of food, exiſt, not only in
the ſeminal fluids of both ſexes, and in the
remnants of food that adhere to the teeth, but
likewiſe in the chyle and in the excrements.
Leeuwenhoek, having met with them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of frogs, and of other animals which
he diſſected, was at firſt greatly ſurpriſed; and,
not being able to conjecture from whence ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
could proceed ſo ſimilar to thoſe in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
liquor he had juſt been examining, he
accuſes his own want of dexterity, and ſuppoſes,
that, in diffecting the animal, he had inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly
opened the ſeminal veſſels, and that the
ſemen had in this manner been mixed with the
faeces. But, having afterwards obſerved the
ſame phaenomenon in the faeces of other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and even in his own, he was then totally
non-pluſſed. It is worthy of remark, that
Leeuwenhoek never found animalcules in his
own faeces, but when they were liquid. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his ſtomach was out of order, and his belly
was looſe, the animalcules appeared; but, when
his food was properly concocted, and his faeces
were hard, not a ſingle animalcule was to be
found, although he diluted the faeces with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Theſe facts ſeem perfectly to coincide
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0195400702:250"/>
with what we formerly advanced; for, when
the ſtomach and inteſtines properly perform
their functions, the faeces are only the groſs
dregs of the aliment, and all the nouriſhing and
organic particles are abſorbed by the lacteal veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels:
In this caſe, we cannot expect to find or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles in the faeces, which are ſolely
compoſed of the uſeleſs and inert part of our
food. But, when the ſtomach and inteſtines,
from any indiſpoſition, allow the food to paſs
without being properly digeſted, then the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic
particles mix with the faeces; and, when
examined with the microſcope, we diſcover
them in the form of living organic bodies. Hence
we may conclude, that people who are troubled
with looſeneſs ſhould have leſs ſeminal liquor,
and be leſs fitted for the purpoſes of generation,
than thoſe of a contrary habit of body.</p>
               <p>I have all along ſuppoſed that the female fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
a fluid equally neceſſary to generation as
that of the male. In the firſt chapter, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to prove, that every organized body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
living organic particles; and, in Chap. II.
and III. that nutrition and reproduction are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the ſame cauſe; that nutrition is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by abſorption, or an intimate penetration
of organic particles through all parts of the
body; and that reproduction is effected by the
ſuperplus of theſe ſame organic particles, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from every part of the body, and depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in reſervoirs deſtined for that purpoſe. In
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0195400702:251"/>
Chap. IV. I have ſhown how this theory applies
to the generation of man, and other animals
which have different ſexes. Females being orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
bodies, as well as males, they muſt alſo
have ſome reſervoirs for the reception of the
ſurplus of organic particles returned from all
parts of their bodies. This ſurplus, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from every part of the body, muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the form of a fluid; and it is this ſluid
to which I have given the appellation of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
ſemen.</p>
               <p>This fluid is not inert, as Ariſtotle pretends,
but prolific, and equally eſſential to generation
as the ſemen of the male. It contains particles
diſtinctive of the female ſex, as that of the other
ſex contains particles proper for the conſtitution
of male organs; and each of them contain all
the other organic particles which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as common to both ſexes: And hence,
from a mixture of the two, the ſon may reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his mother, and the daughter her father.
Hippocrates maintains, that the ſemen conſiſts
of two fluids, one ſtrong, which produces males,
and the other weak, which produces females.
But, as the ſeminal fluid is extracted from every
part of the body, it is impoſſible to conceive how
the body of a female ſhould produce particles
proper for the formation of male organs.</p>
               <p>This liquor muſt enter, by ſome way or other,
into the uterus of viviparous animals; and, in
oviparous animals, it muſt be abſorbed by the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0195400702:252"/>
eggs, which may be regarded as portable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trixes.
Each of theſe matrixes, or eggs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a ſmall drop of the female fluid, in that
part which is called the cicatrice. This prolific
drop, when the female has had no communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the male, aſſumes, as Malpighius ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
the form of a mole or inorganic maſs;
but, when it is penetrated by the ſemen of the
male, it produces a foetus, which is nouriſhed
and brought to perfection by the juices of the
egg.</p>
               <p>Eggs, therefore, inſtead of being common to
all females, are only inſtruments employed by
nature for ſupplying the place of uteri in thoſe
animals which are deprived of this organ. Inſtead
of being active and eſſential to the firſt impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
eggs are only paſſive or accidental parts,
deſtined for the nouriſhment of the foetus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
formed in a particular part of this matrix
by the mixture of the male and female ſemen.
Inſtead of exiſting from the creation, and each
including within itſelf an infinity of males and
females, eggs, on the contrary, are bodies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of a ſuperfluous part of the food, which
is more groſs, and leſs organic, than that of
which the ſeminal fluid conſiſts. The egg, in
oviparous females, anſwers the ſame purpoſes
as the uterus and menſtrual flux in the vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>To evince that eggs are only deſtined by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſupply the place of an uterus in ſuch ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0195400702:253"/>
as are deprived of this organ, we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to conſider, that females produce eggs inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
of the male. The uterus, in viviparous
animals, is a part peculiar to the female ſex;
in the ſame manner, female fowls, who want
this organ, have the defect amply ſupplied by
the ſucceſſive production of eggs, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
exiſt in theſe females, independent of all
communication with the male. To pretend that
the foetus pre-exiſted in the egg, and that eggs
are contained, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> within each other,
is equally ridiculous as to maintain that the
foetus pre-exiſted in the uterus, and that the
uterus of the firſt female contained all the uteri
that ever were or will be produced.</p>
               <p>Anatomiſts have applied the term <hi>egg</hi> to
things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> very oppoſite natures. Harvey, in
his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Omnia ex ovo,</hi> by the word <hi>egg,</hi>
when applied to oviparous animals, means only
the bag which includes the foetus and all its
appendages. He imagined that he perceived
the formation of this egg or bag immediately
after the junction of the male and female. But
this egg proceeded not from the ovarium of the
female: He even aſſerts, that he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
the ſmalleſt alteration in the ovarium.
It is apparent, that there is not here the moſt
diſtant analogy to what is commonly underſtood
by the word <hi>egg,</hi> unleſs, perhaps, the figure of
the bag might have ſome faint reſemblance to
that of an egg. Harvey, though he diſſected
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0195400702:254"/>
many viviparous females, never could perceive
any change in their ovaria: He even regards
them as glands totally unconnected with the
purpoſes of generation<note n="*" place="bottom">See Harvey, Exercit. 64. and 65.</note>, though, as we have
ſeen, they undergo very conſiderable changes.
This able anatomiſt was deceived by the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the glandular bodies in animals of the
deer kind, to which his reſearches were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
confined. Conradus Peyerus, who made
many obſervations on the teſticles of female
deers, remarks, 'Exigui quidem ſunt damarum
teſticuli, ſed poſt coitum foecundum, in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utro
eorum, papilla, ſive tuberculum fibroſum,
ſemper ſuccreſcit; ſcrofis autem praegnanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
tanta accidit teſticulorum mutatio, ut me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrem
quoque attentionem fugere nequeat<note n="†" place="bottom">See Conrad. Peyer. Merycolog.</note>.'
This author aſcribes, with propriety, the reaſon
why Harvey obſerved no changes in the teſticles
of the deer, to their ſmallneſs. But he is wrong
when he tells us, that the changes he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
and which had eſcaped Harvey, never
happened but after impregnation.</p>
               <p>Harvey was deceived in ſeveral other eſſential
articles. He inſiſts, that the ſemen never enters
into the uterus, and that it is impoſſible for it to
find admittance; and yet Verheyen found a
great quantity of male ſemen in the uterus of a
cow, which he diſſected ſix hours after copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Verheyen, ſup. anat. tra. 5. cap. 3.</note>. The celebrated Ruyſch informs us, that,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0195400702:255"/>
in diſſecting a woman who had been killed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the act of adultery, he found a
conſiderable quantity of male ſemen, not only
in the uterus, but in the Fallopian tubes<note n="*" place="bottom">See Ruyſch Theſ. anat. p. 90. tab. VI. fig. 1.</note>. Valiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieri
likewiſe aſſures us, that Fallopius, and other
anatomiſts, had diſcovered male ſemen in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri
of ſeveral women. This point, therefore,
though denied by Harvey, is eſtabliſhed by the
poſitive teſtimony of ſeveral able anatomiſts, and
particularly by Leeuwenhoek, who found male
ſemen in the uteri of many different ſpecies of
females.</p>
               <p>Harvey mentions an abortion, in the ſecond
month, as large as a pigeon's egg, without any
appearance of a foetus. In this alſo he muſt
have been deceived; for Ruyſch, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
anatomiſts, maintain, that the foetus is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable
by the naked eye, even in the firſt
month of pregnancy. In the Hiſtory of the
French Academy, we have an account of a foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
compleatly formed on the twenty-firſt day
after impregnation. If, to theſe authorities, we
add that of Malpighius, who diſtinguiſhed the
chick in the cicatrice immediately after the
egg iſſued from the body of the hen, we cannot
heſitate in pronouncing that the foetus is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
immediately after copulation; and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
no credit is due to what Harvey ſays
concerning the increaſe of the parts by juxta-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
ſince theſe parts exiſt from the beginning,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0195400702:256"/>
and gradually expand till the foetus be perfectly
mature.</p>
               <p>Graaf differs widely from Harvey in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of the word <hi>egg.</hi> He maintains, that
the female teſticles are real ovaria, and contain
eggs ſimilar to thoſe of oviparous animals, only
that they are much ſmaller, never fall out of the
body, nor detach themſelves till after impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when they deſcend from the ovarium into
the uterus. The experiments of Graaf have
contributed more to the belief of the exiſtence of
eggs, than thoſe of any other anatomiſt. They
are, notwithſtanding, totally void of foundation;
for this celebrated author, in the firſt place, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
the veſicles of the ovarium for eggs, though
they are inſeparable from the ovarium, form a
part of its ſubſtance, and are filled with a ſpecies
of lymph. 2. He is ſtill more deceived, when
he informs us, that the glandular bodies are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the coverings of theſe eggs or veſicles; for it
is certain, from the obſervations of Malpighius
and of Valiſnieri, and from my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that the glandular bodies contain no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles.
3. He is wrong in maintaining that the
glandular bodies never appear till after impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
On the contrary, theſe bodies are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
found in all females, after the age of
puberty. 4. He errs in ſuppoſing that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules
which he ſaw in the uterus, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the foetuſes, were the very veſicles that
had deſcended from the ovarium into the uterus,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0195400702:257"/>
and that, he remarks, had become ten times
ſmaller than when they were in the ovarium.
This circumſtance alone of their diminiſhed ſize
ſhould have convinced him of his miſtake. 5.
He is not leſs unfortunate in maintaining that
the glandular bodies are only the coverings of
the fecundated eggs, and that the number of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings
or empty follicles always correſpond
to the number of foetuſes. This aſſertion is the
reverſe of truth; for, on the teſticles of all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males,
we uniformly find a greater number of
glandular bodies, or cicatrices, than of foetuſes
actually produced; and they even appear in
thoſe which never brought forth. To this we may
add, that neither he, Verheyen, nor any other
perſon, ever ſaw the egg in this pretended co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
or in its follicle, though they have thought
proper to reſt their ſyſtem upon that ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Malpighius, who diſtinguiſhed the growth of
the glandular bodies in the female teſticle, was
deceived when he imagined that he once or twice
diſcovered the egg in their cavities; for this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
contains only a fluid; beſides, after number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
experiments, no man has ever been able to
diſcover any thing that had the moſt diſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
to an egg.</p>
               <p>Valiſnieri, who is never deceived with regard
to facts, is wrong in maintaining that the egg

he, nor any man elſe, was ever able to diſcover
it.</p>
               <p>Let us now attend to what may be eſteemed
the real diſcoveries of theſe anatomiſts. Graaf
was the firſt who diſcovered that the teſticles of
females ſuffered any change; and he was right
in maintaining that they were parts eſſentially
neceſſary to generation. Malpighius demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the glandular bodies gradually grew to
maturity, and that, immediately after, they were
obliterated, and left behind them only a ſlight
cicatrice. Valiſnieri illuſtrated this ſubject ſtill
farther. He diſcovered that theſe glandular
bodies were found in the teſticles of all females;
that they were conſiderably augmented in the
ſeaſon of love; that they increaſed at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the lymphatic veſicles of the teſticle;
and that, during the time of their maturity, they
were hollow and full of liquor. Theſe are all
the truths we have learned concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ovaria and eggs of viviparous animals:
What concluſions are we to draw from them?
Two things appear to be evident: The one, that
no eggs exiſt in the teſticles of females; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that there is a fluid both in the veſicles of
the teſticle, and in the cavity of the glandular
bodies; and we have demonſtrated, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
experiments, that this laſt fluid is the true
female ſemen, becauſe it contains, like that of the
male, ſpermatic animals, or rather organic par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0195400702:261"/>
The ſeminal fluid of females, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus fully aſcertained, after what has been
ſaid, we muſt be ſatisfied that the ſeminal fluid
in general is the ſuperfluous organic part of our
food, which is tranſmitted from all parts of the
body to the teſticles and ſeminal veſſels of males,
and to the teſticles and glandular bodies of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males.
This liquor, which iſſues through the
nipples of the glandular bodies, perpetually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dews
the Fallopian tubes, and may caſily find
admiſſion into them, either by abſorption, or by
the ſmall aperture at their extremity, and in this
manner may deſcend into the uterus. But, on
the ſuppoſition of the exiſtence of eggs, which
are ten or twenty times larger than the aperture
of the tubes, it is impoſſible to conceive the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of their being tranſmitted to the uterus.</p>
               <p>The liquor ſhed by females in the paroxyſm
of love, which Graaf ſuppoſes to proceed from
lacunae about the neck of the uterus and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice
of the urethra, may be a portion of the
ſuperfluous fluid that continually diſtills from the
glandular bodies upon the Fallopian tubes. But
perhaps this liquor may be a ſecretion of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
kind, and no way connected with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
To decide this queſtion, microſcopic
obſervations would be neceſſary; but <hi>all</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
are not permitted even to philoſophers.
I am inclined to think, that, in this liquor, the
ſame ſpermatic animals, or moving bodies, would
be found as appear in the fluid of the glandular
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0195400702:262"/>
bodies. Upon this ſubject, I might quote the
authority of an Italian phyſician, who had an
opportunity of trying this experiment, which is
thus related by Valiſnieri<note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. 2. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

&amp;c. If the fact be genuine, as I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to doubt, it is certain that this liquor is the
ſame with that contained in the glandular bodies,
and, of courſe, that it is a real ſeminal fluid,
which eſcapes through the lacunae of Graaf, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
about the neck of the uterus.</p>
               <p>Hence we may conclude, that the moſt libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
females will be the leaſt fruitful, becauſe
they throw out of the body that fluid which
ought to remain in the uterus for the formation
of the foetus. We likewiſe learn why common
proſtitutes ſeldom conceive; and why women
in warm climates, who have more ardent deſires
than thoſe of colder regions, are leſs fertile.
But of this we ſhall afterwards have occaſion to
treat.</p>
               <p>It is natural to imagine that the ſeminal fluid
of either ſex ſhould not be fertile, unleſs when it
contains moving bodies. But this point is ſtill
undetermined. The Italian phyſician, mentioned
above, alledges, that he never found ſpermatic

animals in his ſemen till he arrived at 40 years,
although he was the father of many children,
and continued, after the animalcules appeared,
to beget more.</p>
               <p>The ſpermatic moving bodies may be regarded
as the firſt aſſemblages of the organic particles
which proceed from all parts of the body; and,
when a great number of them unite, they become
perceptible by means of the microſcope. But,
when the number united is ſmall, the body they
form is too minute to be viſible, and no motion
will appear in the ſeminal fluid, a caſe which not
unfrequently happens. But a long train of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
experiments would be neceſſary to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the cauſes of the different ſtates in which
this fluid appears.</p>
               <p>Of one thing I am certain, from repeated tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
that a ſeminal liquor, though no motion can
be perceived when it is firſt taken from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
after being three or four days infuſed in
water, produces as great a number of organic
moving particles, as another ſemen, treated in
the ſame manner, which at firſt contained vaſt
multitudes. Theſe moving bodies appear like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in infuſions of the blood, of the chyle,
of the fleſh, and even of the urine, as well as in
infuſions of all parts of vegetables; and thoſe which
appear in all theſe different ſubſtances, ſeem to
have nothing peculiar to them. They all move
and act nearly in the ſame manner. If we will
have theſe bodies to be animated, it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0195400702:265"/>
that they are very imperfect, and ought
to be regarded only as the rudiments of animals,
or rather as bodies compoſed of particles eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to the exiſtence of animals. As Nature's
productions are uniform, and advance by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
degrees, there is no improbability in
ſuppoſing the exiſtence of organized bodies which
properly belong not either to the animal or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
kingdoms.</p>
               <p>However this matter may ſtand, it is fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcertained,
that all animal and vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
contain an infinite number of living or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles. Theſe particles ſucceſſively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
different forms, and different degrees of
activity, according to different circumſtances.
They are more abundant in the ſeminal fluids of
both ſexes, and in the ſeeds of plants, than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other part of the animal or vegetable. There
exiſts, therefore, in vegetables and animals, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſubſtance which is common to them both;
and this ſubſtance is the matter neceſſary to their
nutrition. The animal is nouriſhed by vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or animal ſubſtances; and the vegetable is
nouriſhed by the ſame ſubſtances in a decompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſtate. This common nutritive ſubſtance is
always alive and active. It produces an animal
or a vegetable, whenever it finds an internal
mould or matrix accommodated to the one or
the other, as has already been explained. But,
when this active ſubſtance is collected too abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
in a place where it has an opportunity of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0195400702:266"/>
uniting, it forms, in the animal body, other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creatures, as the tape-worm, the aſcarides,
the worms ſometimes found in the veins, in the
ſinuſes of the brain, in the liver, &amp;c. Animals
of this kind owe not their exiſtence to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of individuals of the ſame ſpecies. It
is, therefore, natural to think, that they are
produced by an extravaſation of the organic
matter, or by an inability in the lacteal veſſels
to abſorb the quantity of it preſented to them.
But we ſhall afterwards have occaſion to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
more in detail the nature of theſe worms,
and of other animals which are produced in a
ſimilar manner.</p>
               <p>When this organic matter, which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as an univerſal ſemen, is aſſembled in
great quantities, as in the ſeminal fluids, and in
the mucilaginous part of the infuſions of plants,
its firſt effect is to vegetate, or rather to produce
vegetating beings. Theſe zoophytes ſwell, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
ramify, and then produce globular, oval,
and other ſmall bodies of different figures, all of
which enjoy a ſpecies of animal life; they have
a progreſſive motion, which is ſometimes very
rapid, and ſometimes more ſlow. The globules
themſelves decompoſe, change their figure, and
become ſmaller; and, in proportion as they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
in ſize, the rapidity of their motion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes imagined, that the venom of
the viper, and even the poiſon of enraged ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0195400702:267"/>
might proceed from this active matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much exalted. But I have not yet had
leiſure for experiments of this kind, nor for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcertaining
the nature of different drugs. All I
can ſay at preſent is, that infuſions of the moſt
active drugs abound with moving bodies, and
that they appear ſooner in them than in other
ſubſtances.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all microſcopic animals are of the ſame
nature with the moving bodies in the ſeminal
fluids, and in infuſions of animal and vegetable
ſubſtances. The eels in paſte, in vinegar, &amp;c.
are all of the ſame nature, and derived from the
ſame origin. But the proofs and illuſtrations
relative to this ſubject, we ſhall reſerve till we
give the particular hiſtory of microſcopic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals.</p>

               <p>THE nutrition and the reproduction of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
and of vegetables, are thus effected
by the ſame matter. It is a ſubſtance univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prolific, and compoſed of organic particles,
the union of which gives riſe to all organized
bodies. Nature always works on the ſame ſtock,
and this ſtock is inexhauſtible. But the means
ſhe employs to give it value are various; and
theſe general varieties and affinities merit the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of philoſophers, becauſe from them we
are enabled to account for particular exceptions
to the common plan of her operations.</p>
               <p>In general, large animals are leſs prolific than
ſmall ones. The whale, the elephant, the rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceros,
the horſe, man, &amp;c. produce but one,
and very rarely two, at a birth. But ſmall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
as rats, herrings, and inſects, produce a
great number. Does this difference proceed
from the greater quantity of nouriſhment ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſupport the large animals than the
ſmall, and from the former having a leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional
quantity of ſuperfluous nutritive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0195400702:269"/>
capable of being converted into ſemen,
than the former? It is certain, that the ſmall
animals eat more, in proportion to their bulk,
than the large. But it is likewiſe probable, that
the prodigious increaſe of the ſmaller animals,
as bees, flies, and other inſects, may be owing
to the extreme fineneſs and delicacy of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and members, by which they are enabled
to ſelect the moſt ſubſtantial and moſt organic
parts of the animals and vegetables, from which
they extract their nouriſhment. A bee, which
lives upon the pureſt and moſt refined parts of
flowers, receives from its food a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
quantity of organic particles than a horſe,
who feeds upon hay, ſtraw, and the groſſer parts
of vegetables. The horſe, accordingly, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
but one at a time, while the bee produces
many thouſands. The oviparous animals are,
in general, ſmaller than the viviparous, and they
are likewiſe much more prolific. The long time
that the foetus remains in the uterus of vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
animals, is another obſtacle to multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
During geſtation, and the ſuckling of the
young, no new generation can take place. But
the oviparous animals, which produce, at the
ſame time, both uterus and foetus, and throw
them out of the body, are almoſt perpetually in
a condition to reproduce; and it is well known,
that, if a hen be prevented from ſitting, and be
fully fed, the number of her eggs may be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increaſed. If hens lay not while they brood,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0195400702:270"/>
it is becauſe they ceaſe to eat; and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they leave not their neſts but once a day,
and even then for a very ſhort time, leſt their
eggs ſhould be injured by the cold. During this
operation, they take not above one tenth part of
their ordinary nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Animals which produce but one at a birth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
nearly their full growth before they are fit
for generating. But thoſe which produce many,
generate before they are half grown. Man, the
horſe, the aſs, the ſheep, are incapable of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
till after they have nearly acquired the
greateſt part of their growth. It is the ſame
with pigeons and other birds that lay but a ſmall
number of eggs: But thoſe that are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific,
as cocks and hens, fiſhes, &amp;c. begin to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
much ſooner. A cock is capable of this
operation at the age of three months, when he
is not above one third of his full ſize. A fiſh,
which, in 20 years, will weigh 30 pounds, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates
the firſt or ſecond year, when it weighs
not, perhaps, more than half a pound. But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
are ſtill wanting to aſcertain the growth
and duration of fiſhes: Their age may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by examining with a microſcope the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
rings or ſtrata of which their ſcales are
compoſed. But we are ignorant how far this
may extend. I have ſeen, in the Count de
Maurepas' ponds, carps which were well atteſted
to be at leaſt 150 years old, and they appeared
to be equally active and lively as common carps.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0195400702:271"/>
I will not ſay with Leeuwenhoek, that fiſhes
are immortal, or, at leaſt, that they cannot die
of old age. Every thing, in time, muſt periſh.
Whatever has an origin, a birth, or commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
muſt arrive at a termination or death.
But fiſhes, by living in a uniform element, and
being ſheltered from the injurious viciſſitudes of
the air, muſt continue longer in the ſame ſtate
than other animals, eſpecially if theſe viciſſitudes,
as Bacon remarks, be the chief cauſes of the
deſtruction of animated beings. But the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
cauſe of the longevity of fiſhes is, that their
bones are ſofter than thoſe of other animals, and
do not perceptibly harden with age. The bones
of fiſhes lengthen, and turn thick without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
more ſolidity. But the denſity of the
bones of other animals continually increaſes;
and, when their interſtices are completely filled
and obſtructed, the circulation of their fluids
ceaſes, and death enſues. But, in the bones of
fiſhes, this augmentation of ſolidity, which is the
natural cauſe of death, proceeds in ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible
manner, that they muſt live very
long before they can feel any of the effects of
old age.</p>
               <p>All quadrupeds covered with hair are vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and thoſe covered with ſcales are ovipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
The cloſe texture of the ſhells or ſcales
of oviparous animals prevents them from loſing
ſo much matter by tranſpiration, as makes its
way through the porous ſkins of the viviparous.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0195400702:272"/>
May not this retention of ſuperfluous nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which cannot eſcape by tranſpiration, be
one reaſon of the extraordinary fertility of theſe
animals, and of their being able to ſubſiſt a long
time without food? All birds and flying inſects
are oviparous, except ſome ſpecies of flies which
produce their young alive<note n="*" place="bottom">See Leeuwenhoek, tom. 4. p. 91.</note>. Theſe have no
wings immediately after their birth; but they
gradually ſhoot out as the animal advances in
growth; and they are not in a condition to be
uſed till it acquires full maturity. All ſhell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhes
are viviparous; and likewiſe thoſe reptiles
that have no feet, as ſnakes and ſerpents; they
change their ſkins, which are compoſed of ſmall
ſcales. The viper is but a ſlight objection to
this general rule; for it is not properly vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
It firſt produces eggs, from which the
young are hatched: This operation is indeed
carried on and compleated in the body of the
mother; and, in place of laying the eggs, like
other oviparous animals, the viper hatches them
within the body. The ſalamander, in which, as
Maupertuis remarks<note n="†" place="bottom">Mem. de l'Acad, année 1727, p. 32.</note>, both eggs and young are
found at the ſame time, is a ſimilar exception in
oviparous quadrupeds.</p>
               <p>Moſt animals are multiplied and perpetuated
by copulation. But many animals, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
number of birds, propagate rather by a kind
of compreſſion, than a proper copulation. Some
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0195400702:273"/>
birds, indeed, as the oſtrich, the male duck, &amp;c.
have conſiderable members, and propagate by a
real intromiſſion. Male fiſhes approach the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
in the ſeaſon of ſpawning. They ſeem
to rub their bellies againſt each other; for the
male often turns on his back to meet the belly
of the female. But no actual copulation takes
place. The part neceſſary for this operation
does not exiſt; and the males only approach the
females for the purpoſe of ſhedding the liquor
of their milts upon the eggs, which at that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
drop from the females. The male ſeems to
be more attached to the eggs than to the female;
for, when ſhe ceaſes to throw out the eggs, the
male inſtantly abandons her, and follows, with
ardor, the eggs which are carried down by the
ſtream, or diſperſed by the winds. He paſſes
and repaſſes a thouſand times over every place
where he finds eggs. It is not, ſurely, for the
love of the mother that he makes all theſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
He cannot even be ſuppoſed to know
her; for he has been often ſeen ſhedding his
ſemen promiſcuouſly on all the eggs that came
in his way, without having ever met with the
female to which they belonged.</p>
               <p>Thus ſome animals are diſtinguiſhed by ſexes,
and endowed with members proper for copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There are others which likewiſe have ſexes, but want the neceſſary members. Others,
as ſnails, have both members and ſexes in each
individual. Others, as the vine-fretters, have
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0195400702:274"/>
no ſexes, are equally fathers or mothers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
of themſelves without copulation. Though
they ſeem to copulate at pleaſure, we are unable
to diſcover the uſe of their junction, or whether
it be really a ſexual embrace; unleſs we ſhould
ſuppoſe Nature to have endowed this ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect
with generative faculties ſuperior to thoſe of
any other ſpecies of animals, and to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on every individual not only the power
of reproduction, but likewiſe the power of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying
by ſexual communications.</p>
               <p>But, whatever varieties take place in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of different ſpecies of animals, Nature
prepares the body for it by a new production,
which, whether it be external or internal, always
precedes generation: Immediately before the
ſeaſon of impregnation, the ovaria of oviparous
animals, and the teſticles of the females of the
viviparous, undergo a conſiderable change. The
oviparous animals produce eggs, which gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increaſe in ſize, till they quit the ovarium
and fall into the canal of the uterus, where they
receive their white, their membranes, and their
ſhell. This production marks the fecundity of
the female, and without which generation could
not be effected. In viviparous females, in the
ſame manner, one or more glandular bodies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon the teſticles, which gradually grow
under the membranes that covers them. Theſe
glandular bodies increaſe, and pierce, or rather
elevate the membrane of the teſticle; and, when
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0195400702:275"/>
they arrive at maturity, a fiſſure, or ſeveral little
holes, appear at their extremities, through which
the ſeminal fluid eſcapes, and falls into the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.
Theſe glandular bodies are new produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which always precede generation, and
without which it could not be effected.</p>
               <p>Males undergo a ſimilar change before they
are fit for the purpoſes of generating. In the
oviparous animals, the ſeminal reſervoirs are
filled, and ſometimes the reſervoirs themſelves
are annually renewed. The milts of ſome fiſhes,
and particularly of the calmar, are renewed every
year. The teſticles of birds, immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſeaſon of their amours, ſwell to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous
degree. The teſticles of the males of
viviparous animals, eſpecially of thoſe which have
ſeaſons, likewiſe ſwell conſiderably; and, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
the genitals of every ſpecies ſuffer an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
which, though it be external and caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
may be regarded as a new production that
neceſſarily precedes the faculty of generating.</p>
               <p>Thus, in all animals, whether male or female,
generation is always preceded by new produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and, when there is properly no new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
ſome of the parts ſwell and extend to
a remarkable degree. In ſome animals, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a new production appears, but their whole
bodies are renewed, before generation can be
effected; as happens in the ſurpriſing metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis
of inſects, which ſeems to be intended
for no other purpoſe than to enable theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0195400702:276"/>
to propagate their ſpecies; for their bodies
are full grown before they are transformed.
The inſect, immediately before its transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ceaſes to take nouriſhment; and it has no
organs proper for generation, no means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the nutritive particles, with which it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
more than any other ſpecies of animals,
into eggs, or a ſeminal fluid. Hence the whole
of this great ſurplus of nutritive particles at firſt
unites and moulds itſelf into a form nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
that of the original animal. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillar
becomes a butterfly, becauſe, having no
organs of generation, no reſervoirs for contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſuperfluous nutritive particles, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
being incapable of producing minute
organic bodies ſimilar to the animal itſelf, the
organic nutritive particles, which are always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
aſſume, by their union, the form of a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfly,
partly reſembling that of a caterpillar,
both internally and externally, excepting that
the parts of generation are unfolded, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
capable of receiving and tranſmitting the
nutritive organic particles which form the eggs,
and individuals peculiar to the ſpecies. The
individuals produced by the butterfly ought not
to be butterflies, but caterpillars; becauſe it was
the caterpillar that received the nouriſhment,
and becauſe the organic particles of this nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
muſt therefore be aſſimilated into the form
of a caterpillar, and not of a butterfly, which is
only an occaſional production of the ſuperfluous
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0195400702:277"/>
nouriſhment that precedes the real production of
animals of this ſpecies, and a method employed
by Nature to accompliſh the important purpoſes
of generation, ſimilar to the production of glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular
bodies, and of milts, in other animals.</p>
               <p>When the ſuperabundant quantity of organic
nutritive particles is not great, as in man, and
moſt large animals, generation does not take
place till the growth of the body is nearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted;
and even their prolific powers are limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a ſmall number of young: But, when theſe
particles are more abundant, as in birds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viparous
fiſhes, generation is effected before the
animal be fully grown, and the production of
individuals is very numerous. When the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of organic nutritive particles is ſtill greater,
as in inſects, it firſt produces a large organized
body, retaining the internal and eſſential conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the animal, but differing in ſeveral
parts, as the butterfly differs from the caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and then it quickly generates an amazing
number of young, ſimilar to the animal that firſt
prepared the organic nouriſhment from which
they derived their origin. Laſtly, when the
quantity of ſuperfluous nouriſhment is very
great, and when the animal, at the ſame time,
poſſeſſes the organs neceſſary to generation, as
in the vine-fretters, it firſt confers on each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
the power of generating, and then a
transformation, like that which other inſects
undergo: The vine-fretter becomes a flie; but
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0195400702:278"/>
it can produce nothing, becauſe it is only the
reſidue of the organic particles that had not
been employed in the production of the young.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all animals, man excepted, have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
annual ſeaſons appropriated to the purpoſes
of generation. To birds, ſpring is the ſeaſon of
love: Carps, and ſeveral other fiſhes, ſpawn in
June and Auguſt. Pikes, and ſome other fiſhes,
ſpawn in the ſpring. Cats have three ſeaſons
annually, in the months of January, May, and
September. The roe-deer rut in December,
wolfs and foxes in January, horſes in ſummer,
ſtags in September and October; and almoſt all
inſects generate only during the autumn. Some
animals, as the inſects, are totally exhauſted by
generation, and die ſoon after it. Others, though
they die not, become feeble, are much ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated,
and require a conſiderable time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the great waſte of their organic ſubſtance.
Others are leſs affected, and are capable of
frequently renewing their amours; laſtly, man
is very little affected, or, rather, he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repairs the loſs, and therefore is, at all
times, in a condition for propagating. All theſe
varieties ſolely depend on the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the animal organs. The limits fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Nature upon the modes of exiſting are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
conſpicuous in the manner of taking and
digeſting the food, in the means employed for
retaining or throwing it out of the body, and in
the inſtruments by which the organic particles
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0195400702:279"/>
neceſſary to reproduction are extracted. And,
upon the whole, it is apparent, that every thing
exiſts which can exiſt.</p>
               <p>The times of the geſtation of females are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
various: Some, as mares, carry their
young from eleven to twelve months; others, as
women, cows, and hinds, carry their young nine
months; others, as foxes and wolves, carry five
months; bitches carry nine weeks, cats ſix weeks,
and rabbits thirty-one days. Moſt birds are
hatched in twenty-one days; though ſome of
them, as the thiſtle-finches, hatch in thirteen or
fourteen days. Here the variety is equally great
as in every other part of the oeconomy of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals:
The largeſt animals produce fewer young,
and carry them longeſt; which confirms the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
that the quantity of organic nouriſhment
is proportionally leſs in large than in ſmall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
for the foetus derives its growth and the
expanſion of its parts from the ſuperfluous nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of the mother; and, as this growth
requires longer time in large than in ſmall
animals, it is a proof that the quantity of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles is not ſo great in the former as in
the latter.</p>
               <p>Animals, therefore, are much diverſiſied as to
the time and manner of geſtation, of engender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of producing; and this variety origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
from the very cauſes of generation. For,
though the organic matter, which is common to
every thing that lives or vegetates, be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0195400702:280"/>
principle of reproduction, the manner of its
union, and the combinations it forms, muſt be
infinitely varied, that the whole may become the
ſources of new productions. My experiments
clearly demonſtrate, that there are no pre-exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
germs, and that the generation of animals
and vegetables is not univocal. There are, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
as many beings, which either live or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
produced by a fortuitous aſſemblage of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles, as by a conſtant and ſucceſſive
generation. It is to ſuch productions that we
ought to apply the axiom of the antients, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio
unius, generatio alterius.</hi> The corruption
and reſolution of animals and vegetables pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an infinite variety of organized bodies:
Some of them, as thoſe of the calmar, are only
a kind of machines, which, though exceedingly
ſimple, are very active. Others, as the ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
animalcules, ſeem to imitate the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of animals. Others reſemble vegetables
in their manner of growth and expanſion. There
are others, as thoſe of blighted wheat, which, at
pleaſure, can be made alternately to live or to die;
and it is difficult to know to what they ſhould
be compared. There are ſtill others, and in great
numbers, which are at firſt a kind of animals,
then become a ſpecies of vegetables, and again
return alternately to their vegetable ſtate. The
more we examine this ſpecies of organized bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
we ſhall probably diſcover greater and more
ſingular varieties of them, in proportion as they
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0195400702:281"/>
are farther removed from our obſervation, and
from the ſtructure of other animals with which
we are already acquainted.</p>
               <p>For example, blighted corn, which is effected
by an alteration or reſolution of the organic
ſubſtance of the grain, is compoſed of multitudes
of ſmall organized bodies reſembling eels. When
infuſed in water for ten or twelve hours, we
diſcover them to have a diſtinct wreathing, and
a ſmall degree of progreſſive motion. They
ceaſe to move as ſoon as the water fails them;
and their motion commences upon the addition
of freſh water: This alternate death and reviviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
may be repeated for months, and even for
years; ſo that theſe ſmall machines may be made
to act as long and as often as we pleaſe, without
deſtroying or diminiſhing their force. They
are a ſpecies of machines, which begin to act
whenever they are immerſed in a fluid. Theſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments
ſometimes open like the filaments of the
ſemen, and produce moving globules: We
may, therefore, conclude them to be of the ſame
nature, excepting that they are more fixed and
ſolid.</p>
               <p>The eels in paſte have no other origin than
the union of the organic particles of the moſt
eſſential parts of the grain. The firſt eels which
appear are certainly not produced by other eels;
but, though they are not propagated themſelves,
they fail not to engender other living eels. By
cutting them with the point of a lancet, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0195400702:282"/>
ſmaller eels iſſuing in great numbers out
of their bodies. The body of this animal ſeems
to be only a ſheath or ſac containing a multitude
of ſmaller animals, which perhaps are other
ſheaths of the ſame kind, in which the organic
matter is aſſimilated into the form of eels.</p>
               <p>A great number of experiments would ſtill
be neceſſary to diſtinguiſh theſe animals, which
are ſo ſingular and ſo little underſtood, into claſſes
and genera. Some of them may be regarded
as real zoophytes, which enjoy a kind of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and which, at the ſame time, ſeem to wreath
and move like animals. Others appear, at firſt,
to be animals, and then join and form a ſpecies
of vegetables. A ſmall attention to the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a ſingle grain of corn will elucidate, at
leaſt in part, what I have ſaid on this ſubject. I
might add other examples; but thoſe I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
were only produced for the purpoſe of exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
the varieties of generation. There are
unqueſtionably ſeveral organized bodies which we
conſider as real animals, but which are not engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by others of the ſame ſpecies. Some of
them are only a kind of machines; and ſome
of theſe machines have a certain limited effect,
and act only for a certain time, as the machines
in the milt of the calmar; others may be made
to act as long and as often as we pleaſe, as thoſe
of blighted grain. There are vegetables which
produce animated bodies, as the filaments of the
human ſemen, from which active globules iſſue
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0195400702:283"/>
and move by their own powers. In the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the fermentation, or rather in the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of animal or vegetable ſubſtances, we find
real animals capable of propagating their ſpecies,
though they were not themſelves produced in
this manner. Theſe varieties are, perhaps, more
extenſive than we imagine. Though it be right
to generalize our ideas, to aſſemble the effects of
Nature under one point of view, and to claſs her
productions; yet numberleſs ſhades, and even
degrees, in the great ſcale of being, will always
eſcape our obſervation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <head>Of the Formation of the Foetus.</head>
               <p>FROM the experiments of Verheyen, who
found the ſemen of the bull in the uterus
of a cow, and from thoſe of Ruyſch, Fallopius,
and Leeuwenhoek, who diſcovered male ſemen
in the uteri of women and many other animals,
it ſeems to be a point fully aſcertained, that the
ſemen of the male enters into the uterus of the
female. It is probable, that, during the time of
coition, the orifice of the uterus opens for the
reception of the ſeminal fluid: But, though this
ſhould not happen, the active and prolific part
of the ſemen may penetrate the membranes and
ſubſtance of the uterus itſelf; for, as the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
liquor, as formerly remarked, is almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
compoſed of organic particles, which are
very active, and extremely minute, they may
paſs with the utmoſt facility through the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
and ſubſtance of the uterus.</p>
               <p>What proves that the active part of this fluid
may paſs through the pores and ſubſtance of
the uterus, is the ſudden change it undergoes
immediately after conception. The menſes are
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0195400702:285"/>
obſtructed, the uterus becomes flaccid, ſwells,
and appears to be inflated. All theſe changes
muſt be effected by an active external cauſe, by
the penetration of part of the ſeminal fluid into
the ſubſtance of the uterus. This penetration is
not confined to the ſurface; it extends through
all the veſſels and parts of which the uterus is
compoſed, like that penetration by which nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
and the expanſion of the body is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>We ſhall the more eaſily believe this to be the
caſe, when we reflect, that, during the time of
geſtation, the uterus not only augments in ſize,
but even in its quantity of matter, and that it
poſſeſſes a ſpecies of life, or rather of vegetation,
which continues till the child be delivered. If
the uterus were only a ſac, a reſervoir for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the ſemen and retaining the foetus, it
would extend and diminiſh in thickneſs, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as the foetus grew larger. But the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of the uterus is not a ſimple exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or dilatation of its parts. It not only extends
as the foetus enlarges, but it acquires, at the
ſame time, an additional thickneſs and ſolidity;
or, in other words, both its ſize and quantity of
matter are greatly increaſed. This augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a real growth or increaſe of ſubſtance,
ſimilar to the expanſion of the body in young
animals, which could not be effected but by an
intimate penetration of organic particles analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous
to the ſubſtance of thoſe parts. As this
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0195400702:286"/>
expanſion of the uterus never happens but after
impregnation, the ſeminal liquor muſt be the
cauſe by which it is produced; for the uterus is
conſiderably augmented before the foetus has
acquired bulk enough to dilate it by preſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
its internal ſurface.</p>
               <p>It appears, from my own experiments, to be
equally certain, that the female has a ſeminal
fluid, which begins to be formed in the teſticles,
and is brought to maturity in the glandular bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
This fluid perpetually diſtills through the
ſmall apertures in the extremities of theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and, like that of the male, enters the uterus
by two different ways, either through the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
at the extremities of the horns of the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
or by piercing through the ſubſtance of the
uterus itſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe two ſeminal fluids are extracts from all
parts of the body; and a mixture of them is all
that is neceſſary for the formation of a certain
number of males and females. The more any
animal abounds in this ſeminal fluid, or the more
it abounds in organic particles, the number of
young is the greater, as may be remarked in the
ſmaller animals; and the number of young di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes
in proportion as the organic particles
are leſs abundant, as is the caſe with the larger
animals.</p>
               <p>But, before taking any farther notice of other
animals, we ſhall examine with attention the
formation of the human foetus. In mankind,
as well as in the larger ſpecies of animals, the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0195400702:287"/>
quantity of organic particles in the male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
ſemen is not great, and, accordingly, they
very ſeldom produce above one foetus at a time.
This foetus is either a male or a female, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the number of organic particles predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
in the male or in the female fluid; and
the child reſembles the father or the mother
moſt, according to the proportional quantities of
male or female organic particles in the mixture
of the two liquors.</p>
               <p>I conceive, therefore, that the ſeminal fluids,
both of the male and of the female, are equally
active, and equally neceſſary for the purpoſes of
propagation: And this, I think, is fully proven
by my experiments; for I found in both fluids
the ſame moving bodies; I diſcovered that the
male fluid enters into the uterus, where it meets
with the fluid of the female; that theſe two
fluids are perfectly analogous; and that they are
compoſed of parts not only ſimilar in their form,
but in their action and movements<note n="*" place="bottom">See chap. VI.</note>. Now, I
imagine, that, by the mixture of the two fluids,
the activity of the organic particles proper to
each is ſtopped; that the action of the one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>alances the action of the other; that each or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ic
particle, by ceaſing to move, remains fixed
in the place which correſponds to its nature; and
that this place can be no other than that which
it formerly occupied in the body of the animal
from which it was extracted. Thus all the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic
particles which were detached from the head
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0195400702:288"/>
of the animal, will arrange themſelves in a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
order in the head of the foetus. Thoſe
which proceeded from the back bone, will diſpoſe
themſelves in an order correſponding to the
ſtructure and poſition of the vertebrae. In the
ſame manner, the organic particles which had
been detached from any part of the body, will
naturally aſſume the ſame poſition, and arrange
themſelves in the ſame order that they obſerved
before they were ſeparated from that part. Of
courſe, theſe particles will neceſſarily form a
ſmall organized body, entirely ſimilar to the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
from which they originally proceeded.</p>
               <p>It is worthy of remark, that this mixture of
the organic particles of both ſexes contains par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
that are ſimilar, and particles that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar.
The ſimilar particles are thoſe which
have been detached from all the parts that are
common to the two ſexes. The diſſimilar particles
are thoſe which have been ſeparated from the parts
that diſtinguiſh the two ſexes. In this mixture,
therefore, there is a double portion of particles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined
for the formation of the head, the heart, and
ſuch parts as are common to both ſexes; while
there are no more than what are neceſſary for the
production of the ſexual parts. Now, the ſimilar
particles may act upon each other without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
any diſorder; and they may unite in the
ſame manner as if they had proceeded from the
ſame body. But the diſſimilar parts cannot act
upon each other, nor form any intimate union,
becauſe they have no analogy or relation: Hence
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0195400702:289"/>
theſe particles will preſerve their original nature
without any mixture, will firſt fix their poſition,
without the neceſſity of being penetrated by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Thus the particles which proceed from
the ſexual parts will be firſt fixed, and thoſe that
are common to the two ſexes, whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the male or to the female, will then ſix
indiſcriminately, and form an organized body,
which, in its ſexual parts, will perfectly reſemble
the father, if it be a male, and the mother, if it
be a female, but, which, in the other parts, may
reſemble either or both.</p>
               <p>If what I have advanced be properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
we ſhall, perhaps, be able to obviate an
objection made to the ſyſtem of Ariſtotle, and
which might alſo be urged againſt the doctrine
which I am now eſtabliſhing. The queſtion is,
Why is not every individual, both male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
endowed with the faculty of producing an
animal of its own ſex? I am aware of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of ſolving this queſtion, which I have
ſlightly mentioned in the fifth chapter, and ſhall
now proceed farther to illuſtrate.</p>
               <p>From what is delivered in the firſt four chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and from the experiments I have deſcribed,
it is apparent, that reproduction is effected by
the aſſemblage and union of the organic par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
detached from every part of the animal or
vegetable body, in one or ſeveral common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervoirs;
that theſe particles are the ſame which
ſerve for the nutrition and expanſion of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0195400702:290"/>
body; and that both effects are produced by the
ſame matter, and by the ſame laws. I think I have
eſtabliſhed this point by ſo many facts and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
that it is impoſſible to entertain a doubt
concerning its truth. But, I allow, that the
queſtion may be put, Why every ſeparate animal
and vegetable produces not its own likeneſs,
ſince every individual detaches from all its parts,
and collects in a common reſervoir, the organic
particles neceſſary for the formation of a ſmall
organized body? Why is not this organized
body formed? and why, in moſt animals, is a
mixture of the fluids of both ſexes neceſſary?
If I were to reply, that in all the vegetable tribes,
in all thoſe animals that multiply by cutting,
and in the vine-fretters, which produce without
any ſexual commerce, the general intention of
Nature ſeems to be, that each individual ſhould
multiply its own ſpecies, and that reproduction
by the intervention of ſexes is only an exception
to this general law. It might, with propriety,
be rejoined, that the exception is perhaps more
univerſal than the rule itſelf. To maintain that
all individuals would have the faculty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>producing,
if they were endowed with proper
organs, and if they contained the matter neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for nouriſhing the embryo, is not removing
the difficulty: For, in females, all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
concur; and yet the influence of the
male is indiſpenſible to the production either of
a female or of a male foetus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0195400702:291"/>
But, we come nearer a ſolution of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when we maintain, that, though the fluid
in the teſticles and ſeminal veſſels of the male
contain all the organic particles neceſſary for the
formation of a male foetus, yet theſe particles
cannot receive any local eſtabliſhment or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement
of parts, becauſe a conſtant circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them goes on by means of abſorption,
and by the perpetual ſucceſſion of new ſupplies
from all parts of the body; and that, as the
ſame circulation of the organic particles takes
place in the female, neither of them can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
multiply without the aſſiſtance of the
other; becauſe, in the mixture of the male and
female fluids, the different organic particles of
which they conſiſt have a greater affinity to
each other than they have to the body of the
female where the mixture happens. But, though
this explication were admitted, why, it may ſtill
be aſked, does not the ordinary mode of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
correſpond with it? For, upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
each individual would produce, and,
like ſnails, mutually impregnate one another,
every individual receiving the organic particles
furniſhed by the other, which, without being
injured by any other power, would unite ſolely
by the affinity between the particles themſelves.
If there were no other cauſe by which the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles could be united, perhaps this
mode of generation would be the moſt ſimple.
But it is contrary to the analogy of Nature.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0195400702:292"/>
Few animals are endowed, like ſnails, with both
ſexes; and, therefore, if this mode of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
were the moſt ſimple, it would be more
generally employed by Nature. This ſolution,
of courſe, amounts to no more than a gratuitous
ſuppoſition, that males produce not, ſolely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have not organs proper for contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and nouriſhing a foetus.</p>
               <p>It may be ſtill farther ſuppoſed, that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the organic particles in the ſemen of each
individual requires to be counterbalanced by the
force or action of thoſe of the other individual,
in order to reduce them to a fixed ſtate, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium,
without which the formation of the
foetus cannot be effected; and that the motion
of the organic particles of the female cannot be
counterbalanced by any other cauſe than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
action in the organic particles received from
the male. But this anſwer is too general to be
void of obſcurity. However, when we attend
to all the phaenomena, it may, perhaps, admit
of ſome illuſtration. The mixture of the two
ſeminal fluids produces not only a male or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
foetus, but other organized bodies, which
are endowed with the faculty of growth or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion.
The placenta, the membranes, &amp;c.
are produced at the ſame time, if not ſooner,
than the foetus. There are, therefore, in the
ſeminal fluid of the male or female, or in the
mixture of both, organic particles not only ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the production of the foetus, but of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0195400702:293"/>
placenta and membranes. Since there are no
parts either in the male or female bodies from
which they could be detached, whence do theſe
particles proceed? It muſt be admitted, that the
organic ſeminal particles of each ſex being
equally active, uniformly produce organized
bodies every time that they can ſix themſelves,
by their mutual action upon one another; that,
of the particles deſtined to produce a male, thoſe
peculiar to the male ſex will fix firſt, and form
the ſexual parts; that the particles common to
both ſexes may afterwards fix themſelves indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
in order to form the reſt of the body;
and that the placenta and membranes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the exceſs of organic particles which
have not been employed in the formation of the
foetus. If, as we have ſuppoſed, the foetus be
a male, all the organic particles peculiar to the
female ſex, which have not been employed, as
alſo the ſuperfluous particles of both individuals
which have not entered into the compoſition of
the foetus, and which cannot be leſs than one half
of the whole, remain for the formation of the
membranes and placenta. If the foetus be a
female, the ſame quantity of ſuperfluous organic
particles ſtill remain, and are occupied in forming
the placenta and membranes.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, that the membranes and
placenta, upon this ſuppoſition, ought to become
another foetus, which would be a male, if the
firſt was a female, and a female, if the firſt was
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0195400702:294"/>
a male; becauſe the firſt foetus conſumed only
the organic particles peculiar to the ſex of one
individual, and the half of thoſe particles which
were common to both ſexes; and, of courſe,
the ſexual particles of the other individual, and
the other half of the common particles, remain
ſtill unexhauſted. To this I reply, that the firſt
union of the organic particles prevents a ſecond,
at leaſt under the ſame form; and that the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
being firſt formed, exerts an external force
which deſtroys the natural arrangement of the
other organic particles, and throws them into
that order which is neceſſary for the formation
of the placenta and membranes.</p>
               <p>From the experiments and obſervations for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made, it is apparent, that all animated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
contain an amazing quantity of living or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles. The life of an animal or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſeems to be nothing elſe than a reſult of
all the particular <hi>lives</hi> (if the expreſſion be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible)
of each of theſe active particles, whoſe
life is primitive, and perhaps indiſtructible.
Theſe living particles we have found in every
animal and vegetable ſubſtance; and we are
certain, that all theſe particles are equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the nutrition, and, conſequently, to the
reproduction of animals and vegetables. That
the union of a certain number of theſe particles,
therefore, ſhould produce an animated being,
it is not difficult to conceive. As each particle
is animated, a whole, or any aſſemblage of them,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0195400702:295"/>
muſt be endowed with life. Theſe living or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles being common to all animated
beings, they are capable of forming particular
ſpecies of animals, or of vegetables, according
to the peculiar arrangement they aſſume. Now,
this arrangement depends entirely on the form
of the individuals which furniſh the organic
particles. If they are furniſhed by an animal,
they arrange themſelves under the form pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to its ſpecies, exactly agreeable to that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement
they obſerved when they nouriſhed
or expanded the animal itſelf. But, does not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſuppoſe the neceſſity
of ſome baſe or centre, round which the particles
aſſemble in order to unite and form a foetus?
This baſis is furniſhed by the particles which
form the ſexual parts. I ſhall illuſtrate this point.</p>
               <p>As long as the organic particles of either ſex
remain alone, their activity produces no effect,
becauſe it is not oppoſed by any reſiſtance or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
from particles of a different kind. But,
when the male and female liquors are blended,
the particles detached from the ſexual parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a different kind, ſerve as a baſe to fix the
activity of the other particles.</p>
               <p>Upon this ſuppoſition, that the organic par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
which, in the mixture of the two fluids,
repreſent the ſexual parts of the male, can alone
ſerve as a baſis to the particles which proceed from
all parts of the female; and that thoſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from all parts of the male can only be fixed
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0195400702:296"/>
by the particles which are detached from the
ſexual parts of the female; we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the ſexual parts of the male foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
are formed by the organic particles of the
father, and the reſt of its body by the organic
particles of the female; and, on the contrary,
that the female foetus derives nothing but its
ſex from the mother, and the reſt of its body
from the father. Boys, therefore, excepting in
the parts which diſtinguiſh their ſex, ought to
reſemble the mother more than the father, and
girls ſhould reſemble the father more than the
mother.</p>
               <p>Conſidering generation by ſexes under this
light, we ſhould conclude it to be the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
manner of reproduction, as it is in reality.
Beings of the moſt perfect organization, as ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
whoſe bodies make a whole that is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of diviſion, and whoſe powers are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrated
into one point, cannot be reproduced
in any other way; becauſe they contain only
particles that are perfectly ſimilar, and cannot
be united but by means of different particles
furniſhed by another individual. But vegetables,
which are leſs perfect in their organization, and
which can be divided without deſtruction, are
capable of being reproduced in different ways:
1. Becauſe they contain diſſimilar particles;
2. Becauſe the form of theſe bodies is leſs fixed
and determined than that of an animal, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
parts may ſupply the functions of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0195400702:297"/>
and vary according to circumſtances: The
roots of a tree, when expoſed to the air, puſh out
branches and leaves; and thus the organic par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of vegetables obtain a local eſtabliſhment,
become fixed, and produce individuals in many
different ways.</p>
               <p>The ſame phaenomenon is exhibited in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
whoſe organization is leſs perfect, as in the
freſh water polypus, and others, that are capable
of reproducing by the diviſion of their parts.
Theſe organized bodies, inſtead of ſingle ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
may be conſidered as bundles of organized
beings united by a common membrane, as trees
are compoſed of an infinite number of minute
trees<note n="*" place="bottom">See Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note>. The vine-fretters, which propagate indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually,
likewiſe contain diſſimilar particles;
becauſe, after producing their young, they
change into barren flies. Snails mutually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
diſſimilar particles to each other; and,
therefore, each individual is fruitful. Thus, in
every mode of generation with which we are
acquainted, we find, that the neceſſary union of
the organic particles cannot be effected but by
the admixture of different particles, to ſerve as
a common baſis, and to fix or deſtroy their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
               <p>According to this general idea of ſexes, we
may ſuppoſe, that the diſtinction of ſex extends
through all Nature; for <hi>ſex,</hi> in this ſenſe, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that part of bodies which furniſhes
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0195400702:298"/>
organic particles of a different kind from thoſe
of the common parts, and which ſerve as a baſis
for their union. But it is, perhaps, uſeleſs to
reaſon on a queſtion which can be ſolved at once,
by ſaying, that, as God has created ſexes, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
muſt neceſſarily be produced by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention.
We are not in a condition, as I
formerly remarked, to explain <hi>why</hi> things exiſt;
we are unable to explain <hi>why</hi> Nature almoſt
univerſally employs ſexes for the reproduction
of animals, or <hi>why</hi> ſexes exiſt. We ought,
therefore, to content ourſelves with reaſoning
concerning things as they are. If we attempt
to riſe higher, we loſe ourſelves in the regions
of fancy, and forget the narrow limits of our
knowledge.</p>
               <p>Leaving, therefore, all farther ſubtleties, I
ſhall adhere to nothing that is not founded on
facts and obſervation. I find that the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of bodies is effected in many different
modes: But, at the ſame time, I clearly perceive,
that animals and vegetables are reproduced by
the union of the organic particles detached from
all parts of their bodies. I am certain that theſe
active organic particles exiſt in the ſeeds of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
and in the ſeminal fluids of animals,
both male and female; and have no doubt that
every ſpecies of reproduction is accompliſhed
by the union and admixture of theſe particles.
It is equally unqueſtionable, that, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of man, and other animals, the organic
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0195400702:299"/>
particles of the male and female mix at the time
of conception; becauſe we often ſee children
who reſemble both father and mother: And,
what confirms this theory is, that all the particles
common to the two ſexes mix together promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly,
but that the particles peculiar to the
ſexes never mix; for we daily perceive children
with eyes reſembling thoſe of the father, while
their mouth and front reſemble thoſe of the
mother. But we never ſee any ſuch mixture of
reſemblances in the ſexual parts; we never find,
in the ſame individual, the teſticles of the father
and the vagina of the mother.</p>
               <p>The formation of the foetus, therefore, is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the mixture of the organic particles of
both ſexes; and this mixture fixes or gives a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
eſtabliſhment to the particles, becauſe it is
made according to the laws of affinity which
take place between the different parts, and which
determine the particles to arrange themſelves in
the ſame order they obſerved when they exiſted
in the individuals who furniſhed them. The
particles which proceed from the head, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
cannot, according to theſe laws, take up
their ſtation in the legs, or in any other part
but the head of the foetus. All the particles are
in motion when they firſt unite; and this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt be round the point or centre of union.
This baſis or central point, which is neceſſary
to the union of the particles, and which, by its
reaction and inertia, fixes and deſtroys their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0195400702:300"/>
is probably the firſt aſſemblage of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
that proceed from the ſexual parts, becauſe
they are the only particles in the mixture that
differ from thoſe common to both ſexes.</p>
               <p>I imagine, therefore, that, in the mixture of
the two fluids, the organic particles which come
from the ſexual parts of the male fix themſelves
firſt, and cannot unite with thoſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the ſeminal parts of the female, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are of a different nature, and have
leſs affinity to each other than the particles that
come from the eye, the arm, or any other part
of the female. Round this centre, or point of
union, the other organic particles ſucceſſively ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range
themſelves in the ſame order they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exiſted in the body from which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived;
and, according as the particles of the one
or of the other individual moſt abound, or near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
this central point, they enter in greater or
leſs quantities into the compoſition of the new
being, which, in this manner, is formed in the
middle of a homogeneous fluid; at the ſame
time, veſſels begin to ſhoot, which increaſe in
proportion to the growth of the foetus, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
it with proper nouriſhment. Theſe veſſels,
which have a peculiar ſpecies of organization,
are probably formed by the exceſs of the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic
particles which have not been admitted into the
compoſition of the foetus; for, as theſe particles
are both active, and furniſhed with a baſe or
point of union from the organic particles pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0195400702:301"/>
to the ſexual parts of the other individual,
they muſt arrange themſelves in the form of an
organized body, but not in the form of another
foetus; becauſe their poſition with reſpect to
each other has been changed by the different
movements of the particles which entered into the
compoſition of the firſt foetus. From the union
of theſe ſuperabundant particles, therefore, an
irregular body muſt ariſe, which will reſemble
the foetus in nothing but its growth and expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
becauſe, though this body be compoſed of
the ſame organic active particles with the foetus,
their poſition and form muſt be different, as they
were thrown aſide from the centre or point of
union, which ſerved as a baſis for the formation
of the foetus.</p>
               <p>When the quantity of ſeminal fluid of both
individuals is great, or, rather, when theſe liquors
abound with organic particles, different centres
of attraction are formed in different parts of the
mixture; and, in that caſe, by a mechaniſm ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to what has been mentioned above, ſeveral
foetuſes are formed, ſome of them males, and
others females, according as the particles of the
one ſex or of the other are moſt active. But,
from the ſame centre of attraction, two foetuſes
can never originate; becauſe two centres are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
for this purpoſe. Beſides, if this were to
happen, no particles would be left for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the placenta and membranes; becauſe
they would all be employed in conſtituting the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0195400702:302"/>
ſecond foetus, which would neceſſarily be a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
if the other was a male. All that could
happen in ſuch a caſe would be, that ſome of
the particles common to both individuals, being
equally attracted by the firſt centre of union,
muſt arrive there at the ſame time, and produce
a monſter, or a foetus with ſuperfluous parts;
or, if ſome of the common particles ſhould fix
at too great a diſtance from the firſt centre, or be
conſtrained by the attraction of the ſecond, round
which the placenta is formed, a monſter, defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in ſome part, would be the conſequence.</p>
               <p>That the organic particles peculiar to the ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual
parts ſerve for a baſis or centre of union to
the other particles of which the embryo is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I pretend not to demonſtrate: But, as they
are the only particles which differ from the reſt,
it is more natural to imagine that they ſhould
anſwer this purpoſe than thoſe which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both individuals.</p>
               <p>I formerly detected the errors of thoſe who
maintained, that the heart, or the blood, were firſt
formed. The whole is formed at the ſame time.
We learn from actual obſervation, that the
chicken exiſts in the egg before it is ſit upon.
The head, the back-bone, and even the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages
which form the placenta, are all diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
I have opened a great number of eggs,
both before and after incubation, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
from the evidence of my own eyes, that
the whole chicken exiſts, in the middle of the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0195400702:303"/>
cicatrice, the moment the egg iſſues from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the hen. The heat communicated to it by
incubation, only expands the parts, by putting
the fluids in motion. But we have never been
able to determine, with certainty, what parts of
the foetus are firſt fixed, at the moment of its
formation.</p>
               <p>I have always maintained, that the organic
particles were fixed, and that they united in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of their motion being ſuſpended. Of
the truth of this fact I am fully convinced; for,
if the male and female ſemen be ſeparately exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
we find in both a great number of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
particles; but, when theſe fluids are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the motion of the particles is totally deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and a certain degree of heat is neceſſary to
renew their activity; for the chicken, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts
in the centre of the cicatrice, has no motion
before incubation; and, even 24 hours, or two
days afterwards, when we begin to perceive it
without the microſcope, it has not the ſmalleſt
appearance of motion. During the firſt two or
three days, the foetus is only a ſmall white mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilaginous
maſs, which gradually acquires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
and magnitude. But this progreſs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
ſlow, and has no reſemblance to the
rapid movements of the organic particles in the
ſeminal fluid. Beſides, it was not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that I maintained that the motion of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles was entirely deſtroyed; for, if
eggs be kept without expoſing them to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0195400702:304"/>
of heat that is neceſſary for the expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the chicken, the embryo, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
formed, will remain without any motion,
and the organic particles of which it is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
will continue fixed, without being able to
give life and motion to the embryo which was
formed by their union. Thus, after the motion
of the organic particles is ſtopped, and after they
have united in ſuch a manner as to form a foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
ſome external cauſe is ſtill neceſſary to give
them life and motion. This cauſe, or agent, is
heat, which, by rarifying the fluids, obliges them
to circulate: This circulation makes all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
act; and nothing farther is neceſſary for
the growth and expanſion of the parts than the
continuation of this heat.</p>
               <p>Before the action of this external heat, there
is not the ſmalleſt appearance of blood; and I
never could perceive any change of colour in
the veſſels till about 24 hours after incubation.
In the veſſels of the placenta, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the body of the foetus, the blood firſt
appears. But, it would ſeem that this blood lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
its red colour, as it approaches the body of
the animal; for the chicken is entirely white;
and, during the firſt, ſecond, and third days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
incubation, we can with difficulty perceive
a few red particles near the animal's body, but
which ſeem not to make any part of it, though
theſe red particles are deſtined for the formation
of the heart. Thus the formation of blood is
an effect produced by the motion communicated
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0195400702:305"/>
to the fluids by heat; and even this blood is
formed without the body of the animal, the
whole ſubſtance of which conſiſts of a white
mucilage.</p>
               <p>The foetus, as well as the placenta, receive the
nouriſhment that is neceſſary for their expanſion
by a ſpecies of abſorption; and they aſſimilate
the organic particles of the liquor in which they
ſwim: For, it is an equal impropriety to ſay that
the placenta nouriſhes the animal, as that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
nouriſhes the placenta. If the placenta
nouriſhed the foetus, the former would diminiſh
in proportion to the growth of the latter, which
by no means happens; for both augment toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I have indeed obſerved, that, in eggs, the
placenta at firſt grows much more in proportion
than the foetus, and, conſequently, it may nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
the animal; or, rather, it conveys nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to it by means of abſorption.</p>
               <p>What we have ſaid concerning the chicken,
admits of an eaſy application to the human foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
which is formed by the union of the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic
particles of the two ſexes. The membranes
and placenta are produced by the ſuperabundant
particles that enter not into the compoſition of
the foetus, which is now incloſed in a double
membrane, containing alſo a quantity of fluid.
This fluid is at firſt, perhaps, nothing but a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſeminal liquors of the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and, as the foetus is not thrown out of the
uterus, it enjoys, from the moment of its forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0195400702:306"/>
as much external heat as is ſufficient for its
expanſion. This heat communicates motion to
the fluids; it gives play to all the organs; and
the blood is formed in the placenta, and in the
body of the foetus, ſolely by the motion excited
by the heat. We might even maintain, that the
formation of the blood in a child is as indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the mother, as that which ariſes in the
egg is independent of the hen that covers it, or
of the furnace which heats it.</p>
               <p>It is certain that the foetus, the membranes,
and the placenta, are all nouriſhed and expanded
by abſorption; for, at firſt, the ſack that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the whole product of generation does not
adhere to the uterus: And we have ſeen, from
the experiments of De Graaf upon female rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
that he made the globules which contained
the foetuſes roll about in the uterus. They
could receive no nouriſhment, therefore, but by
abſorbing the fluids that conſtantly bedew the
uterus, to which they afterwards begin to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
by means of a mucilage that gradually gives
origin to ſmall blood-veſſels, as ſhall afterwards
be more fully explained.</p>
               <p>But to return to the formation of the foetus,
concerning which we have to make ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,
both as to its ſituation, and to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
circumſtances that may prevent or alter the
mode of its production.</p>
               <p>In the human ſpecies, the ſemen of the male
enters into the uterus, the cavity of which is
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0195400702:307"/>
conſiderable; and, when it meets with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
quantity of female ſemen, the two inſtantly
mix, and the organic particles unite and form
the foetus. The whole is, perhaps, performed
in a moment, eſpecially if the two fluids be in
an active ſtate. The cavity of the uterus is the
proper place for the formation of the foetus;
becauſe the ſemen of the male has an eaſier ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
into the uterus than into the Fallopian
tubes or ovarium; and, as the uterus has only
a ſmall aperture, which is always ſhut, excepting
when opened by the ardor of love, the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of generation remain there in ſafety, unleſs
they be diſturbed by ſome rare and accidental
circumſtance. But, as the male fluid moiſtens
the vagina, before it penetrates the uterus, and,
as the organic particles are exceedingly active,
it may penetrate as far as the Fallopian tubes
and ovarium. In the ſame manner, as the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
fluid is already perfected in the glandular
bodies of the teſticles, from which it diſtills and
moiſtens the Fallopian tubes, before it deſcends
into the uterus; and, as it may eſcape through
the lacunae round the neck of the uterus, it is
not impoſſible that the mixture of the two li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
may take place in all theſe different pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Foetuſes, therefore, may frequently be
formed in the vagina, and inſtantly fall out of
it, having nothing proper for their retention.
They may alſo be ſometimes formed in the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopian
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0195400702:308"/>
tubes; but inſtances of this kind muſt be
rare.</p>
               <p>Anatomiſts mention, that foetuſes have been

in Paris, ſhowed to the academy a rude maſs
which he found in the right ovarium of a girl of
18 years of age. Two open fiſſures, garniſhed
with hair like the eye-lids, were perceived in it.
Above theſe eye-lids was a kind of front, with
a black line in place of eye-brows. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
above the front, there were ſeveral hairs col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
into two ſeparate pencils, one of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſeven inches long, and the other three. Below
the angle of the eye, two large, hard, white
dentes molares appeared, together with their
gums: Theſe teeth were about three lines long,
and about a line diſtant from each other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other teeth appeared, ſituated at different
diſtances. In the ſame volume<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 244.</note>, M. Mery is
reported to have found in the ovarium of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
an upper jaw-bone, with ſeveral teeth in
it, ſo perfect that they appeared to be at leaſt
of ten years growth. In the Medical Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
publiſhed by the Abbé de la Roque<note n="‡" place="bottom">January 1683.</note>, we
have the hiſtory of a woman, who died of her
ninth child, which had been formed <hi>in</hi> or <hi>near</hi>
one of the ovaria; for, from the deſcription, it
is not clear whether the child was within the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varium,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0195400702:309"/>
or only adjacent to it. This foetus was
about an inch thick, and compleatly formed. In
the Philoſophical Tranſactions, examples are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of teeth, hair, and bones being found in
the ovaria of women. If all theſe facts can be
credited, the ſeminal liquor of the male muſt be
ſuppoſed ſometimes, though rarely, to mount up
to the ovaria. But there are many conſiderations
which render this point extremely doubtful:
1. The facts which ſeem to ſupport it are few:
2. The only inſtance of a perfect foetus found
in the ovarium, is narrated in a very ſuſpicious
manner by M. Littre. Neither is it impoſſible
that the ſeminal fluid of the female alone may
ſometimes produce organized maſſes, as moles,
ciſts full of hair, of bones, or of fleſh. Beſides,
if we are to believe anatomiſts, foetuſes may be
formed in the teſticles of men as well as in thoſe
of women; for, we are told by a ſurgeon, in the
2d volume of the hiſtory of the old academy<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 298.</note>,
that he found a foetus, with its membranes, in
which the head, the feet, the eyes, the bones and
cartilages, were diſtinguiſhable in the ſcrotum of
a man. Were all theſe facts equally worthy of
credit, we muſt neceſſarily adopt one of the two
following hypotheſes; either that the ſeminal
fluid of each ſex can produce nothing without
being mixed with the other; or, that either of
the fluids alone is capable of producing irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
organized maſſes. If we maintain the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0195400702:310"/>
hypotheſis, to explain the facts above rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
we ſhall be obliged to admit, that the male
fluid ſometimes aſcends to the ovarium, and, by
mixing there with the female fluid, forms or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
bodies; and alſo, that the female fluid,
by being copiouſly effuſed in the vagina, may,
in the time of coition, penetrate as far as the
ſcrotum of the male, in the ſame manner as the
venereal virus often reaches that part; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that an organized body may be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſcrotum by a mixture of the male and
female fluids. If the other hypotheſis, which is
the moſt probable, be adopted, namely, that the
ſeminal fluid of each individual may ſeparately
produce organized maſſes, then all theſe oſſeous,
fleſhy, and hairy bodies, which ſometimes appear
in the ovaria of females, and in the ſcrotum of
males, may derive their origin from the ſeminal
fluid of the individual in which they are found.
But it is needleſs to ſpeculate farther concerning
facts which ſeem to be more uncertain than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable;
for I am inclined to think, that the
ſeminal fluid of each individual may ſingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſomething; and that young girls, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
may produce moles, without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with the male, in the ſame manner as
hens lay eggs without the intervention of the
cock. I might ſupport this opinion with obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
equally credible as thoſe we have juſt
now quoted. M. de la Saone, a phyſician and
anatomiſt, publiſhed a treatiſe on this ſubject, in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0195400702:311"/>
which he aſſures us, that nuns, though ſtrictly
cloiſtered, ſometimes produce moles: And why
ſhould this be impoſſible, ſince hens produce eggs
without any communication with the cock, and
ſince we find, in the cicatrices of theſe eggs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a chicken, a mole with its appendages?
The analogy here is ſufficiently ſtrong to make
us at leaſt ſuſpend a raſh determination. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be in this, it is certain, that a mixture of
the two fluids is neceſſary for the formation of
a foetus, and that this mixture cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
effected but in the uterus, or in the Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
tubes, where anatomiſts have ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
foetuſes: And it is natural to imagine,
that thoſe which have been found in the cavity
of the abdomen, have eſcaped by the extremity
of the tube, or by ſome accidental rupture of the
uterus; and that they never fall into the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
from the ovarium, becauſe I think it next
to impoſſible that the ſeminal fluid ſhould aſcend
ſo far. Leeuwenhoek has computed the motion
of his pretended ſpermatic animals to be four
or five inches in 40 minutes; ſo that, if the
whole fluid moved at this rate, in an hour or
two the animalcules might proceed from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina
into the uterus, from the uterus into the
Fallopian tubes, and from the Fallopian tubes
into the ovaria. But, how is it poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that the organic particles, whoſe motion
ceaſes whenever they are deprived of the fluid
part of the ſemen, ſhould arrive at the ovarium,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0195400702:312"/>
unleſs they were accompanied with the liquor
in which they ſwim? The moving particles
cannot give a progreſſive motion to the fluid
which contains them. Thus, whatever activity
may be aſcribed to theſe organic particles, we
cannot conceive how they ſhould arrive at the
ovarium, and there form a foetus, unleſs, by
ſome unknown power, the fluid is abſorbed by
the ovarium, a ſuppoſition which is not only gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous,
but contrary to probability.</p>
               <p>The difficulty attending this ſuppoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the opinion, that the male fluid enters the
uterus, either by its orifice, or by penetrating its
ſubſtance. The female fluid may likewiſe find
its way into the uterus, either by the aperture at
the extremity of the Fallopian tubes, or by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
the ſubſtance of the tubes and uterus.
M. Weitbrech, an able anatomiſt of the acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Peterſburg, has clearly proved that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
fluid can penetrate through the ſubſtance
of the uterus: 'Res omni attentione digniſſima,'

to this acute obſerver, are inſurmountable, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ovicular ſyſtem. But the fact he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
is alone ſufficient to demonſtrate, that the
female fluid may penetrate the ſubſtance of the
uterus; and it is not to be doubted that the male
fluid is capable of entering it in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The change which the male fluid produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the uterus, and the ſpecies of vegetation
or expanſion which it occaſions in that viſcus, is
ſufficient to demonſtrate the truth of the fact.
Beſides, the fluid which iſſues through the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunae
of De Graaf being of the ſame nature
with that of the glandular bodies, it is evident
that this liquor proceeds from the ovaria; and
yet there are no veſſels through which it could
paſs. We muſt therefore conclude, that it pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
through the ſpongy ſubſtance of the parts,
and that it not only enters the uterus, but may
even iſſue out of it, when the parts are irritated.</p>
               <p>But, though this penetration ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as impoſſible, it cannot be denied, that
the female fluid, which diſtills from the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

bodies of the ovaria, may fall into the uterus,
by entering the apertures at the extremities of
the Fallopian tubes, as the male fluid enters by
the orifice of the uterus itſelf; and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the foetus may be formed in the cavity
of the uterus, by the mixture of the two fluids,
in the manner already explained.</p>

               <head>Of the Expanſion, Growth, and Delivery of the
Foetus, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>IN the expanſion of the foetus, two different
ſpecies of growth are diſtinguiſhable: The
firſt, which immediately ſucceeds the formation
of the foetus, is not uniform in all the parts of
the animal. The nearer the foetus approaches
to maturity, the growth of the parts is more
proportional; and it is not till after the birth,
that all the parts grow nearly in an equable
manner. We muſt not imagine, that the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
at the time of its formation, has the exact
figure of an adult. The ſmall embryo, it is
true, contains all the parts eſſential to a man;
but they differ in their ſucceſſive expanſion.</p>
               <p>In an organized body, like that of an animal,
ſome parts may be ſuppoſed to be more eſſential
than others; and though none of them are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
or ſuperfluous, yet there are ſome to which
others ſeem to owe their growth and diſpoſition.
Some parts may be conſidered as fundamental,
without which the animal could not exiſt, and
others as only ſuperficial and acceſſory. The
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0195400702:317"/>
latter ſeem to derive their origin from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and to be intended more for conferring
ſymmetry and external ornament on the animal,
than for enabling it to exiſt, or to perform the
functions eſſential to life. Theſe two different
ſpecies of parts are ſucceſſively expanded, and
are almoſt equally apparent at the time of birth.
But there are other parts, as the teeth, which
arrive not at full maturity till ſeveral years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and others, as the glandular bodies in the
female teſticles, the beard of males, &amp;c. which
appear not till the age of puberty.</p>
               <p>To diſcover the fundamental and eſſential
parts of an animal body, attention muſt be had
to the number, ſituation, and nature of the
whole. Thoſe which are ſimple, thoſe whoſe
poſition is invariable, and thoſe without which
the animal cannot exiſt, muſt neceſſarily be the
moſt eſſential. Thoſe, on the contrary, which
are double, or more numerous, thoſe which
vary in ſize and poſition, and thoſe which may
be taken away without injuring or killing the
creature, may be regarded as leſs eſſential, or
more acceſſory to the animal machine. Ariſtotle
mentions, that the only parts eſſential to all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
are thoſe with which they take and digeſt
their nouriſhment, and throw out the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
part of it from the body. The whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinal
canal is indeed extremely ſimple, and
no other part can ſupply its place. The head
and back-bone are likewiſe ſimple parts, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0195400702:318"/>
of which is invariable. The back-bone
is the foundation of the animal frame; and the
action and movements of moſt members of the
body depend upon the ſpinal marrow which that
bone contains. It is this part, alſo, together with the
head, which appears firſt in the embryo. Now,
theſe ſimple parts, which are firſt formed, are
all eſſential to the exiſtence and the form of the
animal.</p>
               <p>The double parts in an animal body are more
numerous than the ſingle parts; and they ſeem
to be produced on each ſide of the ſingle parts by
a ſpecies of vegetation; for the double parts are
ſimilar in form, and different only in poſition.
The left hand is perfectly ſimilar to the right;
but, if the left hand was placed in the ſituation
of the right, we could not perform the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with it. The ſame thing may be obſerved
of all the double parts: They are ſimilar in
form, but differ in poſition, which is relative to
the body of the particular animal; and, if a line
were drawn, dividing the body into two equal
parts, the poſition of all the ſimilar parts would
tend to this line as to a centre.</p>
               <p>The ſpinal marrow, and the vertebrae in
which it is incloſed, appear to be the real axis
of all the double parts of the animal body, from
which they ſeem to derive their origin, and to
be only proportional branches iſſuing from this
trunk or common baſe; for, in the young chick,
we ſee the ribs ſhooting from each ſide of the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0195400702:319"/>
vertebrae, as the ſmall branches ſhoot out from
the principal branch of a tree. In all embryos,
the middle of the head and the vertebrae firſt
appear; we then ſee, on each ſide of the veſicle
which compoſes the middle of the head, two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
veſicles which ſeem to proceed from the
firſt: Theſe two veſicles contain the eyes, and
the other double parts of the head. In the ſame
manner, we perceive an equal number of ſmall
tubercles iſſuing from each ſide of the vertebrae,
which gradually extend, and form the ribs, and
other double parts of the trunk. Laſtly, the
arms and legs appear like ſmall tubercles on
each ſide of the trunk. This firſt growth is
very different from what afterwards takes place:
It is the production of parts which appear for
the firſt time; the growth which ſucceeds is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an expanſion of parts already formed.</p>
               <p>The order and ſymmetry of the double parts
in all animals, their regular poſition, the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their extenſion and growth, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſimilarity of their ſtructure, ſeem to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
that they derive their origin from the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
parts; that a certain force reſides in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
parts that acts equally on each ſide; or, which
amounts to the ſame, they are the baſes or fulcra
againſt which the action of thoſe powers that
produce the expanſion of the double parts is
exerted; and that the action of theſe forces,
both on the right and left ſides, are preciſely
equal, and counterbalance each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0195400702:320"/>
Hence we may conclude, that, if there is any
defect, or redundance, in the matter deſtined for
the formation of the double parts, as the forces
are equal on each ſide, this defect or exceſs
muſt take place both in the right and left ſides.
If, for example, from a defect of matter, a man
has but two fingers in the right hand, in place
of five, the ſame defect will appear in the left;
if, from an exceſs of matter, there be ſix
fingers in the right hand, he will have the ſame
number in the left; or, if the matter be vitiated,
and produces a change in the parts of one ſide,
the ſame change will appear in the other. Of
this fact we have daily proofs: The parts of
monſters are always deranged in a certain order
and proportion. Hence Nature, even in her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
uniformly commits the leaſt of poſſible
miſtakes.</p>
               <p>This harmony in the poſition of the double
parts of animals, is likewiſe apparent in vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables.
The branches puſh out ſmaller ramifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
on each ſide; the ſmall nerves in the
leaves are equally diſpoſed with regard to the
principal nerve; and, if the ſymmetry appears
to be leſs exact in vegetables than in animals,
this proceeds only from its being more various,
and becauſe its limits are more extenſive, and
leſs preciſe. But the ſame order is eaſily recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſable;
and the ſingle and eſſential parts are
perfectly diſtinct from thoſe which are double;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0195400702:321"/>
and it is evident, that the latter derive their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
from the former.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to determine the form of theſe
double parts before their expanſion, or in what
manner they are complicated, or what figure
reſults from their poſition in relation to the
ſingle parts. The body of an animal, at the
inſtant of its formation, unqueſtionably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
all the parts of which it ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed:
But the relative diſpoſition of theſe
parts is then very different from what after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appears. If we examine the expanſion
of a young leaf of a tree, we will find that it is
plaited on each ſide of the principal nerve; and
that its figure, at this time, has no reſemblance
to that which it afterwards aſſumes. When we
amuſe ourſelves with plaiting paper, in order to
give it the form of a crown, of a boat, &amp;c. the
different plaits of the paper ſeem to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
to the figure which reſults from their
expanſion: We only perceive that the plaits
are uniformly made in a certain order and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
and that, whatever is done on one ſide,
is alſo done on the other. But, to determine
the figures which may reſult from the expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of any given number of folds, is a problem
beyond the powers of geometry. The ſcience
of mathematics reaches not what immediately
depends upon poſition. Leibnitz's art of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis
ſitus</hi> does not yet exiſt; though the art of
knowing the relations that reſult from the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0195400702:322"/>
of things would be, perhaps, more uſeful
than that which has only magnitude for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
for we have more occaſion to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with form than with matter.</p>
               <p>In the expanſion of natural productions, the
folded or plaited parts not only aſſume different
poſitions, but they acquire, at the ſame time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
and ſolidity. Since, therefore, we are
unable to aſcertain the exact reſult of a ſimple
expanſion of a folded figure, in which, as in
folded paper, nothing takes place but a change
of poſition among the parts, without any aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
or diminution of the quantity of
matter, how is it poſſible for us to judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the expanſion of the compound body of
an animal, in which not only the relative poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but likewiſe the quantity of matter in theſe
parts, ſuffer conſiderable changes? We can only
reaſon, therefore, on this ſubject, by drawing
concluſions from the examination of objects at
different periods of their expanſion.</p>
               <p>We, indeed, perceive the chick in the egg
before incubation: It ſwims in a tranſparent
fluid, contained in a ſmall purſe formed by a
very fine membrane in the centre of the cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice.
But the chick is then only a particle of
inanimated matter, in which no organization or
determined figure can be diſtinguiſhed. We can
perceive, however, that one of its extremities is
the head, and the other the back-bone. The
embryo, in this ſtate, ſeems to be the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0195400702:323"/>
of fecundation, reſulting from the mixture
of the male and female ſemen. To aſcertain
this fact, ſeveral things require attention: When
the hen has, for ſome days, been along with the
cock, and afterwards ſeparated from him, the
eggs produced 20 days or a month after this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
are equally fertile as thoſe laid during
her cohabitation with the male. The eggs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
at the end of this period require only the
uſual time of 21 days in hatching; and their
embryos are equally advanced both in form and
conſiſtence. From this circumſtance we might
be led to imagine, that the form in which the
embryo appears before incubation, is not the
immediate effect of the mixture of the two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
fluids, but that it exiſted in different
forms during the abode of the egg in the body
of the mother; for the embryo, in the form in
which we ſee it before incubation, requires only
the aid of heat in order to bring it to maturity.
Now, if this form of the embryo had exiſted
21 days or a month before, when the egg was
firſt impregnated, why was it not hatched by
the internal heat of the mother? Why do we
not find the chick compleatly formed in thoſe
eggs which have been impregnated 21 days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are laid?</p>
               <p>But this difficulty, though ſeemingly great, is
not inſurmountable. When the hen cohabits
with the cock, the cicatrice of each egg, which
contains the ſemen of the female, receives a ſmall
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0195400702:324"/>
quantity of the male fluid. The eggs in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varium
of oviparous females are analogous to the
glandular bodies in the teſticles of the vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
The cicatrice of the egg correſponds to
the cavity of thoſe glandular bodies which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the female ſemen; and that of the male pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates
and mixes with it. The formation of
the embryo inſtantly reſults from this mixture
or union of the two fluids. The firſt egg laid
by the hen after her communication with the
cock, is fecundated and capable of being hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Thoſe which ſhe is afterwards to lay were
all impregnated at the ſame inſtant: But, as
they want ſome eſſential parts, the production of
which has no dependence on the male fluid; as
they have neither the white, the membranes, nor
the ſhell, the ſmall embryos contained in the
cicatrices of theſe imperfect eggs, are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being hatched, though aided by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
heat of the mother. The embryo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
remains in the cicatrice, in the ſame ſtate
in which it was firſt formed, till the egg acquires
all the parts neceſſary to the growth and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of the foetus; and it is not till after the
egg has arrived at full perfection, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion
of the embryo commences. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion
is effected by the external heat of incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation:
But it is unqueſtionable, that, if the egg
could be retained in the body 21 days after it
was completely formed, the chick would be
hatched, unleſs the internal heat of the mother
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0195400702:325"/>
was too great; for the degrees of heat neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for hatching eggs are very limited; and the
leaſt exceſs or defect is equally fatal to this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
The laſt eggs, therefore, laid by the hen,
containing the embryos in the ſame ſtate as
the firſt, prove nothing more than the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their acquiring full perfection before they
can be hatched.</p>
               <p>It is apparent, therefore, that the ſtate of the
embryo when the egg is laid by the hen, is its
firſt ſtate, and that which immediately ſucceeds
impregnation; that it undergoes no interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
changes of form; and conſequently, by
tracing, as Malpighius has done, its gradual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion,
hour after hour, we diſcover every
thing that it is poſſible for us to know, unleſs
we could perceive the mixture of the two fluids,
and the manner in which the particles arrange
themſelves during the firſt formation of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo.</p>
               <p>If we reflect on this inſtantaneous fecundation
of a number of eggs, which are to be laid at ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
intervals, we ſhall diſcover a new argument
againſt the exiſtence of eggs in viviparous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals:
For, if women contained eggs, like hens,
why are not many of them fecundated at the
ſame time? Why does not one impregnation
give birth to a ſucceſſive race of children? And,
when women conceive two or three children,
why do they always come into the world at
the ſame time? If theſe foetuſes were produced
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0195400702:326"/>
from eggs, would they not ſucceed each other
according to the different ſtates of perfection of
the ſeveral eggs at the time of impregnation?
And, would not ſuperfoetations be as frequent
as they are rare, and as natural as they are acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental?</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to trace the gradual expanſion
of the human foetus, as we can that of the chick
in the egg. The opportunities for obſervation
are few; and all we know of this ſubject is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the writings of anatomiſts, ſurgeons,
and accoucheurs. It is from collecting all their
particular obſervations, and comparing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
with their deſcriptions, that the following
abridged hiſtory of the human foetus has been
compiled.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the mixture of the two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
fluids, it is probable that the whole mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of generation exiſt in the uterus under the
form of a ſmall globe; for we learn from ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts,
that, three or four days after conception,
there is a ſmall globular maſs in the uterus, the
greateſt diameter of which is about 6 lines, and
the leaſt 4. This globe is formed by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
membrane, which contains a limpid li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
very like the white of an egg. We may
already perceive, in this liquor, ſome ſmall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,
which are the firſt rudiments of the foetus.
Upon the ſurface of the globe there is a net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
of delicate fibres, which extends from one
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0195400702:327"/>
of the extremities to the middle: Theſe are the
firſt veſtiges of the placenta.</p>
               <p>Seven days after conception, the lineaments
of the foetus are diſtinguiſhable by the naked
eye. They are, however, very imperfect, and
have the appearance of a gelly almoſt tranſparent,
though it has acquired ſome degree of ſolidity.
The head and trunk may be eaſily diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
becauſe this maſs is of an oblong figure, and
the trunk is longeſt and moſt delicate. Some
ſmall fibres, reſembling a plume of feathers, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
from the middle of the foetus, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in the membrane in which it is incloſed.
Theſe fibres are the rudiments of the umbilical
cord.</p>
               <p>Fifteen days after conception, the head and
the moſt prominent features of the face are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.
The noſe reſembles a ſmall elevated
thread perpendicular to a line which marks the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of the lips: Two ſmall black points repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the eyes; and we ſee two holes in place of ears.
The body of the foetus has alſo acquired ſome
growth. On each ſide of the ſuperior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
parts of the trunk, thoſe ſmall protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
appear, which are the rudiments of the
arms and legs. The length of the whole body
is about five French lines.</p>
               <p>Eight days after, in all three weeks, the body
of the foetus is only augmented about a line:
But the arms and legs are apparent. The
growth of the arms is quicker than that of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0195400702:328"/>
legs; and the fingers ſeparate ſooner than the
toes. The internal organization now begins to
be viſible: The bones appear like fine threads.
The ribs are diſpoſed on each ſide of the back-bone
like minute threads: The arms, the legs,
the fingers and toes, are alſo repreſented by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
threads.</p>
               <p>At one month, the foetus is more than an
inch in length: It naturally aſſumes a curved
poſture in the middle of the liquor that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds
it; and the membranes in which the
whole is included, are both augmented and
thickened. The whole maſs is of an oval figure,
the greateſt diameter of which is about an inch
and a half, and the leaſt about an inch and a
quarter. The human figure is no longer equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal:
All the parts of the face are already
diſtinguiſhable; the body is delineated; the
haunches and the belly are prominent; the
hands and legs are formed, and their fingers and
toes are divided; the ſkin is thin and tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
the viſcera reſemble a knot or plexus of
ſibres; the veſſels are like fine threads, and the
membranes are extremely delicate: The bones
are ſtill ſoft, and it is only in a few places that
they have begun to aſſume ſome degree of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
The veſſels which form the umbilical cord
lie parallel to each other in a ſtraight line. The
placenta now occupies only a third of the whole
maſs, inſtead of a half, which it did during the
firſt days; the ſuperficial growth of the placenta,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0195400702:329"/>
therefore, has not been ſo great as that of the
foetus and maſs; but it has received a great
augmentation in ſolidity; it has become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally
thicker than the membranes of the
foetus, both of which are now diſtinguiſhable.</p>
               <p>According to Hippocrates, the male foetus
expands ſooner than the female.</p>
               <p>At the end of ſix weeks, the foetus is about
two inches long, and the human form begins to
be more perfect, only the head is very large in
proportion to the other parts of the body. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this time the motion of the heart becomes
viſible: In 50 days, the heart has been percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to beat for a conſiderable time after the
foetus was extracted from the uterus.</p>
               <p>In two months, the foetus is more than two
inches in length; and the oſſiſication is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
in the middle of the two arm-bones, in
the thigh and leg, and in the point of the under
jaw, which is then greatly advanced before the
upper. Theſe, however, are only oſſeous points.
But, by means of a quicker growth, the clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
are entirely oſſified: The umbilical cord is
formed, and the veſſels which compoſe it begin
to twiſt like the threads of a rope: But this
cord is very ſhort in compariſon of the length
it afterwards acquires.</p>
               <p>In three months, the foetus is nearly three
inches long, and weighs about three ounces.
Hippocrates aſſerts, that at this time the motions
of the male foetus begin to be felt by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0195400702:330"/>
but that thoſe of the female are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
till four months. Some women, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
affirm that they have felt the motions of
the foetus at the beginning of the ſecond month.
It is difficult to acquire any certain knowledge
on this ſubject: The ſenſations excited by the
firſt movements of the foetus depend more, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
on the ſenſibility of the mother, than the
ſtrength of the child.</p>
               <p>Four months and a half after conception, the
length of the foetus is from ſix to ſeven inches.
All the parts are greatly augmented, and eaſily
diſtinguiſhable from each other: Even the nails
appear on the fingers and toes. The teſticles of
the male are ſhut up in the belly above the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.
The ſtomach is filled with a thick fluid,
ſimilar to that which is contained in the amnios.
In the ſmall guts we find a milky fluid, and a
black liquid matter in the great guts. There is
a ſmall quantity of bile in the veſica felis, and
a little urine in the bladder. As the foetus
floats freely in the fluid that ſurrounds it, there
is always ſome ſpace between its body and the
membranes in which it is contained. Theſe
membranes, at firſt, grow more rapidly than the
foetus; but, after a certain time, the reverſe
takes place. Before the end of the third month,
the head is bent forward; the chin reſts on the
breaſt; the knees are elevated, and the legs
folded back upon the thighs. One of the hands,
and often both, touch the face. Afterwards,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0195400702:331"/>
when the foetus acquires more ſtrength, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
changes its poſition, as we learn from
the following obſervations made by perſons ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the art of midwiſery: 1. The umbilical
cord is often twiſted round the body and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the child, in a manner that neceſſarily
ſuppoſes different motions and poſitions. 2. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
feel the motion of the child ſometimes on
one ſide of the uterus, and ſometimes on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and it often ſtrikes againſt many different
places, which could not happen unleſs it aſſumed
different poſitions. 3. As the foetus ſwims in a
fluid which ſurrounds it on all ſides, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
turn, extend, and twiſt itſelf by its own
powers: It muſt likewiſe take different ſituations,
according to the various attitudes of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
body; when the mother, for example,
lies down, the poſition of the foetus muſt differ
from what it is when ſhe ſtands.</p>
               <p>Moſt anatomiſts maintain, that the foetus is
obliged to bend its body, becauſe it is too much
confined by the membranes. But this opinion
ſeems not to be well founded; for, during the
firſt five or ſix months, at leaſt, there is room
more than ſufficient to admit a full extenſion of
the foetus; and yet, during all this period, the
foetus is bended. We ſee likewiſe, that the
chick is bended in the liquor of the amnios,
while, at the ſame time, this membrane, and the
fluid it contains, afford room ſufficient to hold a
body five or ſix times larger than the foetus. We
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0195400702:332"/>
may, therefore, conclude, that the bended po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the foetus is natural, and not the effect
of reſtraint. I am inclined to think, with
Harvey, that the foetus takes this poſture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is moſt favourable to reſt and ſleep;
for all animals bend their bodies when they want
to repoſe themſelves, or to ſleep: And, as the
foetus ſleeps almoſt continually, it naturally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
this advantageous poſition. 'Certe,' ſays
this celebrated anatomiſt, 'animalia omnia, dum
quieſcunt et dormiunt, membra ſua ut pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
adducunt et complicant, figuramque o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valem

quietique aptiſſima) componunt<note n="*" place="bottom">Harvey de Generat. p. 257.</note>.'</p>
               <p>The uterus, as formerly remarked, grows
very quickly after pregnancy; and it continues
to increaſe proportionally with the foetus. But
the growth of the foetus at laſt exceeds that of
the uterus; and it is natural to think, that the
foetus, when near maturity, is too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
and agitates the uterus by repeated mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The mother feels thoſe ſucceſſive efforts,
which are called periodic pains, after the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of child-bearing commences. The more
force the foetus exerts in order to dilate the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,
it finds an increaſed reſiſtance from the
natural elaſticity of the parts. Hence every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0195400702:333"/>
tends to open the os tincae, or orifice of the
uterus, which has already been gradually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
during the laſt months of pregnancy.
The head of the foetus puſhes along againſt the
margins of this orifice, and dilates it by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
preſſure, till the moment of delivery,
when it opens ſo wide as to allow a free paſſage
to the child.</p>
               <p>What renders it probable that the labour-pains
are occaſioned by the dilatation of the os
tincae is, that this dilatation is the only certain
mode of diſtinguiſhing the real from the falſe
pains. Women often feel very briſk pains,
which are not thoſe that immediately precede
delivery. To diſtinguiſh thoſe falſe from the
true pains, Deventer adviſes the accoucheur to
feel the orifice of the uterus, and maintains, that,
if the pains be true, the dilatation will augment
upon the occaſion of every pain; and that, on
the contrary, if the pains be falſe, the orifice
will rather contract than dilate, or, at leaſt, that
it will not continue to dilate. Hence we may
conclude, that theſe pains proceed not from a
forced dilatation of the orifice of the uterus.
The only thing that is embarraſſing, is the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of pain and of eaſe experienced by the
mother. This circumſtance does not perfectly
correſpond with the cauſe we have aſſigned;
for the gradual and continued dilatation of an
orifice ſhould produce a conſtant pain, without
any intervals of eaſe. Perhaps the alternations
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0195400702:334"/>
may be aſcribed to the ſeparation of the placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:
It adheres to the uterus by the inſertions of
a number of ſmall papillae. May we not,
therefore, ſuppoſe that theſe papillae ſeparate
not from their cavities all at once; and that the
ſucceſſive ſeparation of theſe papillae gives riſe, at
different intervals, to the freſh acceſſions of
pains? Here the effect perfectly correſponds
with the cauſe; and this conjecture may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by another remark: Immediately before
delivery, there iſſues out a viſcous whitiſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
ſimilar to that which flows from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillae
of the placenta, when torn from the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus.
It is therefore extremely probable, that
this liquor, which iſſues from the uterus, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the ſeparation of ſome of the papillae
of the placenta.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens, that the foetus eſcapes
from the uterus without burſting the membranes,
and, conſequently, without diſcharging the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
they contain. This ſpecies of birth ſeems
to be the moſt natural, and is ſimilar to that of
moſt animals. The human foetus, however,
commonly pierces the membranes, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
it meets with at the orifice of the uterus:
And ſometimes a part of the amnios, and even
of the chorion, is brought away adhering to the
head of the child like a cap. As ſoon as the
membranes are pierced or torn, the liquor, which
is called the <hi>waters,</hi> runs out, and, by lubrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the vagina and orifice of the uterus, facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
the paſſage of the child. After the diſcharge
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0195400702:335"/>
of the waters, there is ſufficient room left in the
uterus for the midwife to return the child, when
its poſition is unfavourable to the birth. After
the child comes into the world, the delivery is
not completed. The placenta and membranes
ſtill remain in the uterus; and the child is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
to them by means of the umbilical cord:
They are eaſily brought away by the hand of
the midwife; and ſometimes the weight of the
child is ſufficient for that purpoſe. Theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
which were neceſſary to the exiſtence of
the foetus, become uſeleſs, and even noxious to
the child, after its birth. They are, therefore,
inſtantly diſengaged from the child's body, by
caſting a knot on the umbilical cord, about an
inch from the navel, and by cutting the cord an
inch above the ligature. In ſix or ſeven days,
the remains of the cord dry up, and fall off cloſe
to the navel.</p>
               <p>By examining the foetus before birth, we are
enabled to form ſome ideas concerning the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm
of its natural functions. There are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
neceſſary to it while in the womb of the
mother, but which become uſeleſs immediately
after birth. The better to comprehend theſe
functions, we muſt explain more fully the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of theſe acceſſory parts, the umbilical cord,
the membranes, with the liquor they contain,
and the placenta. The umbilical cord, which
is attached to the body of the foetus at the navel,
is compoſed of two arteries and a vein: By
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0195400702:336"/>
theſe the courſe of the circulation is lengthened;
but the vein is larger than the arteries. At the
extremity of the cord, each of theſe veſſels di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
into an infinite number of ramifications,
and extend themſelves between two membranes.
They ſet off from the common trunk in ſuch a
manner, that the whole ramifications aſſume a
round form, and are diſtinguiſhed by the name
of placenta, becauſe they reſemble a cake. The
central part of the placenta is thicker than its
edges: Its mean thickneſs is about an inch, and
its diameter is eight or nine inches, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more. The external ſurface of it, which
is applied to the uterus, is convex, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſurface is concave. The blood of the
foetus circulates in the cord and in the placenta.
The arteries of the cord proceed from two large
arteries in the foetus, and carry the blood
through all the arterial ramifications of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa;
and the blood is collected and returned
to the foetus by the venous branches of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa
and the umbilical vein.</p>
               <p>The concave ſurface of the placenta is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the chorion: Its convex ſurface is alſo
covered with a ſoft membrane, which ſeems to
be a continuation of the chorion, and is eaſily
torn; and the foetus is incloſed in the double
covering of the chorion and amnios. The figure
of the whole is globular; becauſe the intervals
between the foetus and membranes are filled
with a tranſparent fluid. This liquor is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0195400702:337"/>
confined by the amnios, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
membrane: It is thin and tranſparent,
and folds itſelf round the umbilical cord, at its
inſertion into the placenta, and continues to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it the whole way to the navel of the foetus.
The chorion is the external membrane; it is
thick, ſpongy, and interſperſed with blood-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.
It conſiſts of ſeveral coats, the outermoſt
of which covers the convex ſurface of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa.
It ſends off duplicatures to cover the
papillae, which are inſerted into the cavities at
the fundus of the uterus, called <hi>lacunae.</hi> Theſe
inſertions connect the foetus to the uterus.</p>
               <p>Some anatomiſts have maintained, that the
human foetus, like thoſe of certain quadrupeds,
was furniſhed with an <hi>allantois,</hi> a membrane
deſtined for the reception of the urine; and they
have pretended to have diſcovered it between
the chorion and amnios, or in the middle of the
placenta, at the root of the umbilical cord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the form of a pretty large bladder; and that
it received the urine by means of a long tube
which made a part of the cord, and which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at one end into the bladder, and, at the others,
into the allantois, anſwering the ſame purpoſes
as the urachus in other animals. They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
however, that the urachus of the human
foetus is not near ſo large as in the quadrupeds;
but they aſſert that it is divided into a number
of ſmall tubes, and that the urine paſſes into
their cavities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0195400702:338"/>
To theſe facts are oppoſed the experience and
obſervation of moſt anatomiſts. They ſeldom
find any veſtiges of an allantois either between
the chorion and amnios, or in the placenta;
nor do they perceive any urachus in the umbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
cord. A kind of ligament, indeed, runs
from the external ſurface of the bottom of the
bladder to the navel; but, when entering the
cord, it becomes ſo delicate as to be almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to nothing. Neither is this ligament
commonly hollow; and we can perceive no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding
aperture in the bottom of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The foetus has no communication with the
open air; and the experiments made upon the
lungs demonſtrate that they have never reſpired;
for they ſink in water, while thoſe of infants,
who have breathed, uniformly ſwim: The foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
therefore, has no reſpiration in the womb
of the mother; conſequently, it can make no
ſound with its voice, and all the ſtories of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
groaning and crying before birth muſt be
regarded as fabulous. After the waters run off,
however, the air may find admiſſion into the
cavity of the uterus, and the child may begin
to reſpire before its birth. In this caſe, the
child may cry, in the ſame manner as the chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
cries before the ſhell of the egg is broken,
which it is enabled to do by means of the air
lodged in a cavity between the external mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
and the ſhell: This air exiſts in all eggs,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0195400702:339"/>
and is produced by the fermentation of the
matters they contain<note n="*" place="bottom">See Vegetable Statics, chap. 6.</note>.</p>
               <p>The lungs of the foetus, having no motion,
receive no more blood than is ſufficient for
their nouriſhment and growth: Another paſſage,
therefore, is open for its circulation. The blood
in the right auricle of the heart, inſtead of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
into the pulmonary artery, and, after cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating
through the lungs, returning into the
left auricle by the pulmonary vein, paſſes direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the right to the left auricle, through an
aperture called the <hi>foramen ovale,</hi> which is in
the partition of the heart that ſeparates the two
auricles: The blood then enters the aorta, by
the ramifications of which it is diſtributed to
every part of the body; it is then taken up by
the numerous branches of the veins, which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
unite into one trunk, called the <hi>vena cava,</hi>
that terminates in the right auricle of the heart.
The blood contained in this auricle does not all
paſs through the foramen ovale; part of it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes
into the pulmonary artery, but it enters
not into the body of the lungs; for there is a
communication between the pulmonary artery
and the aorta, by an arterial canal which leads
immediately from the one to the other. It is
by theſe means that the blood circulates in the
foetus, without entering the lungs, which it
does in children, in adults, and in all animals
who reſpire.</p>

It has been imagined by ſome, that the blood
of the mother paſſes into the body of the foetus,
by means of the placenta and umbilical cord:
They ſuppoſed, that the blood-veſſels of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus
opened into the lacunae, and thoſe of the
placenta into the papillae, and that they inoſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
with one another. But this opinion is
contradicted by experiment. When the arteries
of the umbilical cord are injected, the liquor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
by the veins, without any of it eſcaping
externally. Beſides, the papillae can be drawn
out of the lacunae in which they are lodged,
without any extravaſation of blood either from
the uterus or placenta; from both there oozes
out a milky matter, which, we have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
ſerves for the nouriſhment of the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.
It is probable that this liquor enters the
veins of the placenta in the ſame manner as the
chyle enters the ſubclavian vein; and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa,
perhaps, performs the office of the lungs
in maturating the blood. One thing is certain,
that the blood appears much ſooner in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa
than in the foetus; and I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
in eggs which had been ſit upon for a
day or two, that the blood appeared firſt in the
membranes, and that their blood-veſſels are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and large, while the whole body of the
foetus, excepting the point where theſe blood-veſſels
terminate, is only a white tranſparent
matter, in which there is not the leaſt veſtige
of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0195400702:341"/>
It has been imagined that the liquor of the
amnios is a nouriſhment received by the mouth
of the foetus. Some have even pretended to
have found this liquor in the ſtomach, and to
have ſeen ſeveral foetuſes who wanted the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical
cord entirely, and others who had only a
ſmall portion of it, which had no connection
with the placenta. But, in this caſe, may not
the liquor have paſſed into the body of the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
by the portion of the cord that remained, or
even by the navel itſelf? Beſides, other facts
may be oppoſed to theſe: Foetuſes have been
found, whoſe lips were not ſeparated; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whoſe oeſophagus had no aperture. To
reconcile theſe facts, ſome anatomiſts have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that the aliment paſſed into the foetus
partly by the umbilical cord, and partly by the
mouth. But none of theſe opinions ſeem to
have any foundation. The queſtion is not, how
the foetus alone, but how the whole apparatus
of generation, receive their growth and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
for the placenta, the liquor, and the
membranes, increaſe in bulk as well as the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;
and, conſequently, thoſe inſtruments and
canals employed for receiving and tranſporting
nouriſhment to the foetus, are themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with a ſpecies of life. The expanſion
of the placenta and membranes is equally diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to conceive as that of the foetus; and, it
may be ſaid, with equal propriety, that the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
nouriſhes the placenta, as that the placenta
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0195400702:342"/>
nouriſhes the foetus. At the commencement
of growth, the whole maſs floats in the uterus,
without any adheſion; and, of courſe, the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
can only be conveyed by an abſorption
of the lacteous fluid contained in the uterus.
The placenta appears firſt to attract this fluid,
which it converts into blood, and tranſports by
the veins into the foetus. The <hi>liquor amnii</hi> ſeems
to be nothing but this milky fluid in a purified
ſtate, the quantity of which is augmented, by a
ſimilar abſorption, in proportion to the growth
of the membranes; and the foetus probably ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbs
this liquor, which ſeems to be neceſſary for
its growth and nouriſhment: For, it is worthy
of remark, that the foetus, during the firſt two
or three months, contains very little blood: It
is as white as ivory, and appears like a conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of lymph ſomewhat conſolidated; and, as
the ſkin is tranſparent, and all the parts extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſoft, the body of the foetus may be eaſily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated
by the fluid in which it ſwims, and thus
receive the matter neceſſary for its growth and
expanſion. It may indeed be ſuppoſed that the
foetus afterwards receives nouriſhment by the
mouth; becauſe we find a liquor, ſimilar to that
of the amnios, in the ſtomach, urine in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and meconium, or excrement, in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines;
and, as neither urine nor meconium ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the amnios, it is natural to conclude,
that no excrements are voided by the foetus, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
as ſome are born without having the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0195400702:343"/>
anus perforated, and yet large quantities of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conium
are found in their inteſtines.</p>
               <p>Though the foetus has no immediate connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the uterus, but is only attached to it
by the ſmall external papillae of the placenta;
though it has no communication with the blood
of the mother, but, in ſome meaſure, is equally
independent of her as the egg is independent of
the hen which covers it; yet it has been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that, whatever affects the mother, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a ſimilar effect upon the foetus, and that
the impreſſions received by the former are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the ſenſorium of the latter. To
this imaginary influence have been attributed all
thoſe reſemblances, monſtroſities, and peculiar
marks which appear on the ſkin of particular chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Many of theſe marks I have examined,
and they uniformly appeared to be occaſioned
only by a derangement in the texture of the
ſkin. Every mark muſt neceſſarily have a faint
reſemblance to ſomething or other: But ſuch
reſemblances, I am perſuaded, depend more on
the imagination of thoſe who ſee them, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that of the mother. On this ſubject, the
marvellous has been puſhed to an extreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
The foetus has not only been ſaid to bear
the real repreſentations of the appetites of the
mother, but that, by a ſingular ſympathy, the
marks which repreſent ſtrawberries, cherries, &amp;c.
aſſumed a deeper colour during the ſeaſon of
theſe fruits. A little attention, however, will
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0195400702:344"/>
convince us, that theſe changes of colour are
more frequent, and that they happen whenever
the motion of the blood is accelerated, whether
it be occaſioned by the heat of ſummer, or by
any other cauſe. The marks are always either
yellow, or red, or black; becauſe the blood gives
theſe colours to the ſkin when it enters in too
great quantities into the veſſels. If theſe marks
were occaſioned by the appetites of the mother,
why are not their forms and colours as various
as the objects of her deſires? What a multitude
of ſtrange figures would be exhibited, if all the
whimſical longings of a mother were written
upon the ſkin of the child?</p>
               <p>As our ſenſations have no reſemblance to the
objects which excite them, it is impoſſible that
deſire, fear, horror, or any other paſſion or emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
can produce real repreſentations of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
by which they are occaſioned. An infant
being, in this reſpect, equally independent of the
mother, as the egg is independent of the hen
that ſits upon it, I ſhould be equally induced to
believe, that the imagination of a hen, which
ſaw by accident a cock's neck twiſted, ſhould
produce wry-necked chickens from the eggs ſhe
was hatching, as that a woman, who ſaw a man
broke upon the wheel; ſhould produce, by the
mere force of imagination, a child with all its
limbs broken.</p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſing this fact to be well atteſted, I
ſtill maintain that the imagination of the mother
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0195400702:345"/>
could not be the cauſe of it: For, what is the
effect of horror? An internal movement, or, if
you pleaſe, a convulſion of the mother's body,
which might alternately compreſs and ſtretch
the uterus. What would be the reſult of this
commotion? Nothing ſimilar to its cauſe; for,
if the commotion was very violent, the foetus
might be killed, wounded, or have ſome of its
parts deranged: But how is it poſſible to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that this commotion ſhould produce in the
foetus any thing ſimilar to the thoughts of the
mother, unleſs we ſuppoſe, with Harvey, that
the uterus poſſeſſes the faculty of conceiving
ideas, and of realiſing them upon the foetus?</p>
               <p>But, if the imagination of the mother has no
effect upon the foetus, it may ſtill be demanded,
Why did this child come into the world with
its members broken? Though a direct ſolution
of a fact, which is both extraordinary and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is not to be expected; yet, I think, this
queſtion admits of a ſatisfactory anſwer. Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of the moſt uncommon kind, and which
are but rarely exhibited, as neceſſarily happen,
as thoſe that are uſual and frequent. Among
the infinite combinations of which matter is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of forming, arrangements of the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and extraordinary ſpecies muſt ſometimes
take place. Hence, out of the numberleſs chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which daily come into the world, one may
ſometimes appear with two heads, with four
legs, or with all its members broken. It is,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0195400702:346"/>
therefore, within the circle of nature, that a
child, without the aid of the mother's imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may be born with its arms and legs bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
This phaenomenon may have been exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
oftener than once; the mother of this
child may, during her pregnancy, have ſeen a
man broken on the wheel; and the defects of
conformation in the child may have been attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the impulſe made, by this dreadful
ſpectacle, upon the imagination of the woman.
But, independent of this general ſolution, the
fact may be explained in a more direct manner.
The foetus, as formerly remarked, has nothing
in common with the mother. Its functions, its
organs, its blood, its movements, are all peculiar,
and belong to itſelf alone. The only matter it
derives from the mother, is the liquor or nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
lymph which diſtills from the uterus. If
this lymph ſuffers any change, if it be infected
with the venereal virus, the infant is affected
with the ſame diſeaſe; and it is reaſonable to
think that all the diſeaſes which proceed from
viciated humours may be communicated from
the mother to the child. We know that the
ſmall pox is communicated in this manner; and
we have too many examples of children, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after birth, becoming innocent victims of
the debauchery of their parents. The veneral
virus attacks the moſt ſolid parts of the bones;
and it appears to act with more force upon the
middle of the bones, which is the part where the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0195400702:347"/>
oſſification firſt commences, and is, of courſe,
the moſt hard and ſolid part. I conceive, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the infant in queſtion has been affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the venereal diſorder while in the womb
of its mother, and that this was the reaſon why
it came into the world with its bones broken
through the middle.</p>
               <p>The ſame effect might be produced by the
rickets: In the royal cabinet, there is a ſkeleton
of a rickety child, the bones of whoſe legs and
arms are joined in the middle by a callus: From
inſpecting this ſkeleton, it appears that its bones
had been broken before birth, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
by a callus.</p>
               <p>But we have dwelt too long upon a fact which
credulity alone has rendered marvellous. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
eſpecially that ſpecies of it which is
founded in wonder, will always triumph over
reaſon. It is needleſs to attempt to perſuade
women that the marks on their children have no
connection with their ungratified longings. I
have ſometimes aſked them, before the birth of
a child, of what particular longings they had
been diſappointed, and, of courſe, what marks
the child would bear? But I had only the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of perplexing, without convincing them.</p>
               <p>The time of geſtation is generally about nine
months; but it is ſometimes longer and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſhorter. Many children are born in the
ſeventh and eighth, and ſome not till after the
ninth month: But, in general, the births before
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0195400702:348"/>
the ninth month are more frequent than thoſe
that exceed that term.</p>
               <p>It is generally believed, that children born in
the eighth month cannot live, or, at leaſt, that
more of them die than of thoſe who come into
the world in the ſeventh month. This opinion
appears to be paradoxical; and, if we conſult
experience, I believe it will be found to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.
A child born in the eighth month is
more perfectly formed, and conſequently more
vigorous and lively, than one who is born in the
ſeventh. This opinion, however, is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
received, and is founded on the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Ariſtotle: 'Caeteris animantibus ferendi
uteri unum eſt tempus, homini vero plura ſunt;
quippe et ſeptimo menſe et decimo naſcitur,
atque etiam inter ſeptimum et decimum poſitis;
qui enim menſe octavo naſcuntur, <hi>etſi minus,</hi>
tamen vivere poſſunt<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide de Generat. anim. l. 4. c. ult.</note>.' The beginning of the
ſeventh month is the earlieſt term of delivery.
If the foetus be rejected ſooner, it dies, and is
denominated an abortion. Thus the time of
geſtation is more various in the human ſpecies
than in other animals; for it extends from the
7th to the 10th, and, perhaps, to the eleventh
month.</p>
               <p>We are aſſured by women who have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
children, that females remain longer in the
womb than males. If this be true, it is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
that female children ſhould ſometimes be
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0195400702:349"/>
born in the 10th month. When infants come
into the world before the 9th month, they are
neither ſo large nor ſo well formed as thoſe who
appear not till a later period. Thoſe, on the
contrary, who remain in the womb till the 10th
month, are larger and better made; their hair is
longer; the growth of the teeth, though ſtill
concealed within the gums, is more advanced;
and the tone of their voice is deeper and more
diſtinct.</p>
               <p>With regard to the occaſional cauſes of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
there is much uncertainty. It is imagined
by ſome writers, that, when the foetus has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a certain ſize, the capacity of the uterus
becomes too ſmall for its retention, and that the
reſtraint felt by the child obliges it to exert every
effort to break its priſon. Others alledge, which
amounts nearly to the ſame thing, that the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
becomes too heavy to be ſupported by the
uterus, which, therefore, opens to be diſcharged
of its load. Neither of theſe reaſons appear to
be ſatisfactory: The uterus has always ſufficient
capacity and ſtrength to contain and ſupport the
weight of a child of nine months; for it is often
loaded with two, during the ſame period; and it
is certain, that the weight and ſize of two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of eight months, for example, exceed thoſe
of a ſingle infant of the ſame age. Beſides, it is
not unfrequent that a child of nine months is
leſs than another at eight months, though it ſtill
remains in the womb.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0195400702:350"/>
Galen pretends that the foetus continues in
the uterus till it is able to take nouriſhment by
the mouth, and that the want of proper food
makes it reſtleſs, and anxious to eſcape. It has
been ſaid by others, that the foetus is originally
nouriſhed by the mouth, but that, in proceſs of
time, the liquor amnii is ſo contaminated with
the urine and tranſpiration of the foetus, that it
becomes perfectly diſguſtful, and obliges the
child to uſe every method to effect its eſcape
from the womb.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons ſeem not to be more ſatisfactory
than the former; for from them it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the ſmalleſt and weakeſt foetuſes would
neceſſarily remain longer in the womb than
thoſe of larger and more robuſt bodies; which
is by no means the caſe. Beſides, it is not for
nouriſhment that the child, immediately after
birth, ſeems to be anxious; for it can diſpenſe
with the want of it for a conſiderable time after:
It appears, on the contrary, to be extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of eaſing itſelf of the ſuperfluous load of
nouriſhment (the meconium) received in the
womb. This circumſtance induced Drelincourt,
and ſome other anatomiſts, to think, that the
acrimony and uneaſineſs, ariſing from an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation
of excrement in the bowels, is the
reaſon why they become reſtleſs, and uſe every
effort to eſcape from the womb. I am not, I
acknowledge, more ſatisfied with this explication
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0195400702:351"/>
than the others. If the child is preſſed with
faeces, why does it not evacuate them in the
liquor amnii? But this never happens. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
on thè contrary, that the neceſſity of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating
the meconium is not felt till after birth,
when the motion of the diaphragm, occaſioned
by reſpiration, compreſſes the inteſtines, and
gives riſe to this evacuation; eſpecially ſince no
meconium was found in the amnios of a foetus
of ten months, who had not reſpired, and ſince
an infant of ſix or ſeven months diſcharges the
meconium ſoon after reſpiration.</p>
               <p>Other anatomiſts, and particularly Fabricius
ab Aquapendente, imagined that the foetus left
the uterus, from a deſire of being refreſhed by
reſpiration. But this cauſe ſeems to be as chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
as any that has been mentioned. It
is impoſſible that a foetus can have any idea of
reſpiration; and far leſs can it have any concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whether reſpiration would be agreeable or
diſagreeable.</p>
               <p>After conſidering all theſe hypotheſes, I ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that the delivery of the foetus depends on
a cauſe of a very different nature. The men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual
flux returns at ſtated intervals. Though
its appearance be interrupted by impregnation,
its cauſe is not deſtroyed; and, though no blood
is exhibited at the accuſtomed period; yet a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
in the ſyſtem, ſimilar to what happens
before impregnation, muſt take place. It is for
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0195400702:352"/>
this reaſon, that, in ſome women, the menſes
are not entirely ſuppreſſed during the firſt two
or three months after conception. I imagine,
therefore, that this periodic revolution happens
as regularly after a woman has conceived as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but that the blood is prevented from
flowing, by the excretories of the uterus being
ſwelled and ſhut up, unleſs when it arrives in
ſuch large quantities, and acts with ſuch force,
as to overcome the reſiſtance which is oppoſed
to it. In this caſe, a great quantity of blood
ruſhes out, and an abortion is the conſequence.
But it frequently happens, that a ſmall quantity
of blood appears, without producing this effect;
becauſe the blood has only been able to open a
few of the canals or excretories of the uterus,
while the reſt remain entirely obſtructed.</p>
               <p>Though no blood appears, which is generally
the caſe, the firſt revolution fails not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the ſame painful ſymptoms.
During the firſt ſuppreſſion of the menſes,
therefore, the uterus is affected with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
agitation, which, when a little augmented,
entirely deſtroys the product of generation.
Hence, we may reaſonably conclude, that few
of thoſe conceptions, which happen a ſhort time
before the accuſtomed return of the menſes, are
ſucceſsful; becauſe the action of the menſtrual
blood eaſily deſtroys the feeble roots of a germ
ſo tender and ſo delicate. Thoſe conceptions,
on the contrary, which take place immediately
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0195400702:353"/>
after this periodic diſcharge, ſucceed much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
becauſe the foetus is allowed more time to
grow, and to fortify itſelf againſt the action of
the blood, when the next revolution happens in
the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>After the foetus has been enabled to reſiſt the
action of the firſt revolution, the increaſe of its
growth, and of its attachment to the uterus, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it ſtill more capable of reſiſting any of the
ſubſequent revolutions: Abortions, indeed,
ſometimes happen during every revolution; but
they are more rare in the middle period of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,
than either at the beginning or near the
end of it. Why they are more frequent at the
beginning, has already been explained: It only
remains to ſhow why they are likewiſe more
frequent towards the end.</p>
               <p>The foetus generally comes into the world du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the tenth revolution of the menſes. When
it is born at the ninth or eighth, it lives, and is
not, therefore, regarded as an abortion. Some
have pretended to have ſeen inſtances of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
born at the ſeventh, and even at the ſixth
revolution, who, notwithſtanding this unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
circumſtance, continued to live. There is
no difference between abortion and birth, but
what relates to the living powers of the child.
In general, the number of abortions in the firſt,
ſecond, and third months, for the reaſons already
aſſigned, is very great; and the number of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5+ letters">
                     <desc>•••••…</desc>
                  </gap> births,
in the ſeventh and eighth months,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0195400702:354"/>
is alſo very great, in proportion to the abortions
in the fourth, fifth, and ſixth months; becauſe,
during this middle term of geſtation, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of generation having acquired ſtrength and
ſolidity ſufficient to reſiſt the action of the firſt
four periodic revolutions, a more violent effort
than any of the former is neceſſary to deſtroy
it. For the ſame reaſon, an abortion is more
difficult during the fifth and ſixth months. But
the foetus, which till now was weak, and could
only exert its own force in a feeble manner,
begins to move with more vigour; and, when
the eighth revolution takes place, the efforts of
the foetus uniting with thoſe of the uterus, and
facilitating its excluſion, the foetus may come
into the world in the ſeventh month, and be in
a capacity of living, whenever it happens to be
unuſually ſtrong at this period. But, if the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
be excluded ſolely from a weakneſs of the
uterus, which renders it unable to reſiſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the blood during the eighth revolution,
the birth of it is conſidered as an abortion, and
the child dies. But ſuch caſes are uncommon;
for, it the foetus has reſiſted the firſt ſeven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
nothing but particular accidents can
prevent it from reſiſting the eighth, unleſs it has
acquired more vigour than is common at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.
A foetus which has acquired the ſame
degree of ſtrength, but at a later period, will be
excluded at the ninth revolution; and thoſe which
require nine months in obtaining this degree of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0195400702:355"/>
ſtrength, will be born at the tenth revolution,
which is the moſt uſual term. But, when the
foetus acquires not this degree of ſtrength and
perfection in nine months, it will remain in the
uterus till the eleventh, or even the twelfth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
that is, till the tenth or eleventh month:
Of ſuch late births many examples are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Other reaſons, to confirm the opinion, that
the menſtrual flux is the occaſional cauſe of
births at different periods, may be produced.
The females of all animals which have no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
bring forth very nearly at the ſame terms:
The difference in the times of geſtation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ſmall. We may, therefore, conclude,
that this variation, which is very great in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
proceeds from the action of the menſtrual
blood, which is exerted at every periodic revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>We have already remarked, that the placenta
adheres to the uterus only by the papillae; that
there is no blood either in theſe papillae, or in
the lacunae in which they are inſerted; and that,
when they are ſeparated, an operation which
requires no great effort, a milky liquor only iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
from them. Why, therefore, is the birth
of a child uniformly followed by a conſiderable
haemorrhage, firſt of pure blood, and afterwards
of blood mixed with a watery fluid? This blood
proceeds not from the ſeparation of the placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;
for the papillae are drawn out of the lacunae
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0195400702:356"/>
without any effuſion of blood. Delivery, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which is nothing more than this ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ought to produce no haemorrhage. Is it
not more natural, on the contrary, to think, that
the action of the blood is the cauſe of the birth;
and that it is this menſtrual blood alone which
forces the veſſels of the empty uterus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to flow immediately after delivery, in the
ſame manner as it did before conception?</p>
               <p>We know, that, for ſome time after conception,
the ſack which contains the product of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
adheres not to the uterus. We have ſeen,
from the experiments of De Graaf, that, by
blowing upon the ſmall globule, it is made to
change its poſition. The adheſion to the uterus
is never very ſtrong: In the early periods of
geſtation, the placenta is ſlightly applied to the
uterus; and thoſe parts are only contiguous, or
joined by a mucilaginous matter which has hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any adheſion. How, then, ſhould it happen,
that, in abortions of the firſt or ſecond month,
this globule never eſcapes without being attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a great effuſion of blood? This effuſion
cannot be occaſioned by the paſſage of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bule,
which has no adheſion to the uterus. It
is by the action of the blood, on the contrary,
that the globule is extruded. Should we not,
therefore, conclude, that this is the menſtrual
blood, which, by forcing the canals through
which it was accuſtomed to flow before impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0195400702:357"/>
deſtroys the product of conception, and
reſumes its ordinary courſe?</p>
               <p>The pains of child-bearing are principally
occaſioned by this action of the blood; for, it
is well known, that they are equally violent in
abortions of two or three months, as in ordinary
births; and that many women feel, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conceived, very acute pains, whenever the
menſtrual flux is about to appear. Theſe pains
are of the ſame kind with thoſe which accompany
abortions or births. Ought we not, therefore,
to aſcribe them to the ſame cauſe?</p>
               <p>It appears, then, that the periodic revolution
of the menſtrual blood has great influence in
child-bearing, and that it is the cauſe why the
terms of delivery in women are more various
than in other animals which are not ſubject to
this diſcharge, and which always bring forth at
the ſame times. It is alſo apparent, that the
revolution occaſioned by the action of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual
blood is not the only cauſe of birth: The
action of the foetus itſelf contributes greatly to
this end; for there are inſtances of children ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made their eſcape from the uterus after the
death of the mother, which could only happen
from an exertion peculiar to the foetus.</p>
               <p>The terms of geſtation in cows, ſheep, and
other animals, are always the ſame, and no hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage
attends their delivery. May we not,
therefore, conclude, that the blood diſcharged
by women after delivery is the menſtrual
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0195400702:358"/>
blood, and that the action of this blood upon
the uterus, during every periodic revolution, is
the reaſon why the human foetus is excluded at
ſo many different terms? It is natural to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine,
that, if the females of viviparous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
had menſes like women, their deliveries
would be followed by an effuſion of blood, and
be equally various in their terms. The foetuſes
of animals are brought forth covered with their
membranes; and it is ſeldom that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
are broken, or the waters flow before
their delivery. But the birth of a child, with
its membranes entire, is a rare phaenomenon.
This circumſtance ſeems to evince, that human
foetuſes make greater efforts to eſcape from
their priſon than thoſe of other animals, or that
the uterus of a woman affords not ſo free a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to the child; for it is by the ſtruggles of
the foetus againſt the reſiſtance it meets with at
the orifice of the uterus, that the membranes
are torn.</p>

               <p>ALL animals are nouriſhed by vegetables,
or by other animals which feed upon vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables.
There is, therefore, in nature, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
common to both, which ſerves for the
growth and nouriſhment of every thing that
lives or vegetates. This matter can have no
other mode of effecting growth and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but by aſſimilating itſelf to every part of
the animal or vegetable, and by intimately pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
the texture and <hi>form</hi> of theſe parts,
which I have diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of
an <hi>internal mould.</hi> When this nutritive mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
abounds more than is ſufficient for the
growth and expanſion of the animal or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
it is detached from all parts of the body,
and depoſited in one or ſeveral reſervoirs, under
the form of a fluid. This fluid contains all the
particles which are analogous to the different parts
of the body, and, of courſe, all that is neceſſary
for the reproduction of a being in miniature
perfectly ſimilar to the firſt. In moſt animals,
this ſuperfluity of nutritive matter does not take
place till they have nearly acquired their full
growth; and hence it is that animals are not
capable of generating before this period.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0195400702:360"/>
When this nutritive and prolific matter, which
is univerſally diffuſed, has paſſed through the
internal mould of an animal or vegetable, and
has found a proper matrix, it produces an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
or vegetable of the ſame ſpecies. But,
when it finds not a ſuitable matrix, it produces
organized beings different from animals or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
as the moving and vegetating bodies
which appear in the ſeminal fluids of animals,
and in the infuſions of the buds of plants, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This prolific matter is compoſed of organic
particles, which are always active, whoſe motions
and actions are fixed or arreſted by the brute
parts of matter in general, and particularly by
oily and ſaline ſubſtances; but, as ſoon as they
are diſengaged from this matter, which is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
to their nature, they reſume their action,
and produce different ſpecies of plants, and other
animated beings.</p>
               <p>The effects of this prolific matter may be ſeen
by the microſcope in the ſeminal fluids of both
male and female animals. The ſemen of vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous
females is ſiltrated through the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
bodies which grow upon their teſticles; and
theſe glandular bodies contain a conſiderable
quantity of ſeminal fluid in their cavities. Ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous
females, as well as the viviparous, have
a ſeminal fluid, which is ſtill more active than
that of the viviparous. The ſemen of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
is, in general, ſimilar to that of the male,
when both are in a natural ſtate. They decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0195400702:361"/>
in the ſame manner; they contain ſimilar
organic particles; and they exhibit the very ſame
appearances.</p>
               <p>All animal and vegetable ſubſtances contain a
great quantity of this organic and prolific mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
To diſcover it, we have only to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it from the brute matter in which it is
entangled; and this operation is effected by
infuſing animal or vegetable ſubſtances in water:
The ſalts melt; the oils ſeparate; and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
particles become evident by their move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
They abound more in the ſeminal fluid
than in any other parts of animals; or rather,
they are there more diſengaged from the brute
matter. Soon after fleſh is infuſed, and while
it is only ſlightly diſſolved, the organic matter
appears under the form of moving bodies, which
are nearly as large as thoſe in the ſeminal fluid.
But, in proportion to the increaſe of the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the ſize of the organic particles is diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and their motion is augmented; and, when
the fleſh is entirely decompoſed or corrupted,
the organic particles are extremely minute, and
their motion is inconceivably rapid. It is then
that this matter may be poiſonous, like that of
the viper's tooth, in which Mr Mead perceived
an infinite number of ſmall pointed bodies, and
which he imagined to be ſalts, though they are
nothing but theſe ſame organic particles in an
extremely active ſtate. The pus which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from wounds may acquire ſuch a degree
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0195400702:362"/>
of putreſcency, as to become a poiſon of the
moſt active kind; for, whenever this active
matter is exalted to a certain point, which may
always be diſtinguiſhed by the rapidity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs
of the moving bodies it contains, it
muſt become a ſpecies of poiſon. The ſame
thing may be remarked with regard to the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of vegetables. The ſame matter which
nouriſhes us while in a natural ſtate, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
us when it is corrupted, as appears from
the gangrenes which affect the limbs of men and
other animals, when they are fed with corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
grain; and from comparing the reſidue of
the food which adheres to our teeth, with that
which proceeds from the teeth of the viper or
of a mad dog, which is nothing but the ſame
matter too much exalted, and in the higheſt ſtate
of putrefaction.</p>
               <p>When large quantities of this organic and
prolific matter are collected in ſome part of an
animal, where it is obliged to remain, it there
forms living beings, which we have always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as real animals. The taenia, the aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,
all the worms found in the veins, in the
liver, in wounds, in pus, and moſt of thoſe which
are formed in putrified fleſh, have no other ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
The eels in paſte, in vinegar, and all the
pretended microſcopic animals, are only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
forms aſſumed, according to circumſtances,
by this active matter, which has a perpetual
tendency to organization.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0195400702:363"/>
In infuſions of all animal and vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
this prolific matter firſt diſcovers itſelf
under the form of vegetation: We ſee it form
into filaments, which grow and expand like
plants; then their extremities and joints ſwell
and burſt, to give paſſage to a multitude of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
bodies which have the ſemblance of animals.
Nature, it would appear, begins all her opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by a kind of vegetable motion: This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we perceive in a variety of microſcopic ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and in the expanſion of the animal embryo;
for a foetus, at firſt, poſſeſſes only a ſpecies of
vegetable growth or motion.</p>
               <p>Sound food furniſhes none of theſe moving
particles for a conſiderable time: Freſh meat,
grain, fruits, &amp;c. require ſome days infuſion
before they exhibit any moving bodies. But
the more any matter is corrupted, decompoſed,
or exalted, as pus, blighted grain, honey, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
fluids, &amp;c. theſe moving bodies the ſooner
make their appearance. In ſeminal fluids, they
are entirely free from other matter; and only a
few hours infuſion are neceſſary to diſcover
them in pus, corrupted grain, honey, ſtrong
drugs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The exiſtence, therefore, of an organic ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
matter, univerſally diffuſed through all
animal and vegetable ſubſtances, and which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſerves for their nouriſhment, their growth,
and their reproduction, is apparent. Nutrition
is effected by the intimate penetration of this
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0195400702:364"/>
matter through every part of animal or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
bodies; expanſion, or growth, is only a
more extenſive ſpecies of nutrition, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
as long as the parts are ductile, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being ſtretched; and reproduction is an
effect of the ſame matter, when it ſuperabounds
in the body of an animal or vegetable. Every
part of organized bodies ſends off to proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervoirs
the organic particles which are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
for its nouriſhment: Theſe particles are
perfectly ſimilar to the different parts from
which they are detached, becauſe they were
deſtined for the nouriſhment of thoſe parts.
Hence, when the whole particles ſent off from
every part of the body are aſſembled, they muſt
neceſſarily form a ſmall body ſimilar to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
becauſe every particle is ſimilar to the
part from which it was detached. It is in this
manner that every ſpecies of reproduction,
where only one individual is requiſite, as that of
trees, plants, polypi, vine-fretters, &amp;c. is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
This is alſo the firſt method employed
by nature for the reproduction of ſuch animals
as require the aid of different ſexes; for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
fluid of each ſex contains all the particles
neceſſary for reproduction: But, to compleat
the operation, ſomething more is requiſite,
namely, the mixture of both fluids in a place
ſuited to the expanſion and growth of the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;
and this place is the uterus of the female.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0195400702:365"/>
There are, therefore, no pre-exiſting germs,
or germs infinitely contained within each other.
But there is an organic matter diffuſed through all
animated nature, which is always active, always
tending to form, to aſſimilate, and to produce
beings ſimilar to thoſe which receive it. The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of animals and of vegetables, therefore,
can never be exhauſted: As long as individuals
ſubſiſt, the different ſpecies will be conſtantly
new; they are the ſame now that they were
three thouſand years ago: The whole will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
exiſt by their own powers, unleſs they
be annihilated by the will of their Creator.</p>

a knowledge of himſelf, yet I
ſuſpect that he is better acquainted with every
other object. Endowed by Nature with organs
ſolely deſtined for our own preſervation, we
employ them only for the reception of external
impreſſions. Anxious to expand our external
exiſtence beyond the limits of our powers, and
to multiply the functions of our ſenſes, we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
employ that internal ſenſe which reduces
us to our true dimenſions, and diſtinguiſhes us
from every other being. If, however, we are
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0195400702:367"/>
deſirous of knowing ourſelves, we muſt cultivate
this ſenſe, by which alone we are enabled to
form a diſpaſſionate judgement concerning our
nature and condition. But how ſhall we give
to this ſenſe its full extent and activity? How
ſhall we emancipate the ſoul, in which it reſides,
from all the illuſions of fancy! We have loſt
the habit of employing this ſenſe; its activity
is repreſſed by the tumult of corporeal ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and parched with the heat of our paſſions;
the heart, the imagination, the ſenſes, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to annihilate its exertions. Unchangeable,
however, in its nature, and invulnerable by its
eſſence, it continues always the ſame. Its
ſplendour may be obſcured, without loſing its
force; it may enlighten us leſs, but it guides us
with certainty. Let us collect thoſe rays which
it ſtill emits, and the darkneſs which ſurrounds
us will diminiſh; and, though the path ſhould
not be equally illuminated from one end to the
other, we ſhall at leaſt have a torch to prevent
us from wandering.</p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt difficult ſtep, in arriving at
a proper knowledge of ourſelves, is to acquire
diſtinct ideas of the two ſubſtances of which we
are compoſed. Simply to affirm, that the one
is immaterial, unextended, and immortal, and
that the other is material, extended, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
is only denying thoſe qualities to the one,
which we know the other poſſeſſes. What real
knowledge can be acquired from this mode of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0195400702:368"/>
negation? Such negative expreſſions can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
no poſitive idea. But, to ſay, that we
are certain of the exiſtence of the former, and
leſs aſſured of that of the latter; that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the one is ſimple, indiviſible, and has
no form, becauſe it manifeſts itſelf only by a
ſingle modification, which is that of thought;
that the other is leſs a ſubſtance, than a ſubject
capable of receiving ſpecies of forms relative to
our ſenſes, which are all as uncertain and as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
as the organs themſelves; is advancing
one ſtep towards a diſtinct idea of the nature of
the two ſubſtances: It is aſcribing to both dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
and peculiar properties; it aſſigns to them
poſitive qualities, and enables us to inſtitute a
compariſon between them.</p>
               <p>All our knowledge is ultimately derived from
compariſon. What is abſolutely incomparable,
muſt be incomprehenſible. Of this God is the
only example: He cannot be comprehended,
becauſe he can be compared with no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But every thing which is ſuſceptible of
being compared, and of being relatively viewed
in different lights, becomes a ſource of human
knowledge. The more ſubjects of compariſon
which any object affords, the means of forming a
proper knowledge concerning it, are proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
increaſed and facilitated.</p>
               <p>The exiſtence of the ſoul is ſelf-evident: To
be, and to think, are, with regard to us, the ſame
thing. This truth is more than intuitive: It is
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0195400702:369"/>
independent of the ſenſes, of the imagination, of
the memory, and of all our other relative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But the exiſtence of our bodies, and of
external objects, is doubtful to every unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
reaſoner; for that extenſion in length,
breadth, and thickneſs, which we call our bodies,
and which ſeem to be ſo intimately connected
with us, is nothing more than a relation of our
ſenſes; and the organs of ſenſation themſelves
are only certain affinities with the objects which
affect them. Has the internal ſenſe, the mind,
any thing common or ſimilar to theſe organs?
Have the ſenſations produced by light or ſound,
any reſemblance to that ſubtile fluid which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
the idea of light, or to that vibration of the
air which conveys to us the notion of ſound?
Theſe effects reſult ſolely from the neceſſary and
intimate relation that ſubſiſts between the eyes
and ears and the different matters which act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. But, as we have demonſtrated, that
there is no reſemblance between ſenſations and
the objects which produce them, is not this a
ſufficient proof that the nature of the ſoul is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from that of matter?</p>
               <p>We may, therefore, conſider it as an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
point, that internal ſenſation is totally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from its cauſe; and we have already
ſhown, that, if external objects exiſt, they muſt
be very different from the ideas we form of
them; becauſe ſenſation has not the moſt diſtant
reſemblance to the objects by which it is excited.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0195400702:370"/>
May we not hence conclude, that the cauſes of
our ſenſations neceſſarily differ from our notions
concerning them? That extenſion which we
perceive by the eye, that impenetrability of which
we acquire the idea by touching, and all the other
conſtituent properties of matter, may have no
exiſtence; ſince our internal ſenſations of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
impenetrability, &amp;c. are neither extended
nor impenetrable, and poſſeſs nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with theſe qualities.</p>
               <p>As the mind, during ſleep, is affected with
ſenſations which are often different from thoſe
excited by the actual preſence of the objects,
is it not natural to think, that the preſence of
objects is not neceſſary to the exiſtence of our
ſenſations, and, conſequently, that both mind
and body may exiſt independent of theſe objects?
For, during ſleep, and after death, the body has
the ſame exiſtence as before, though the mind
recogniſes not this exiſtence, and, with regard to
us, the body entirely loſes its being. Now I aſk,
if any object that can exiſt, and afterwards be
no more, which affects us in a manner totally
different from what it is, and from what it has
been, can be ſo real as to leave no doubt of its
exiſtence?</p>
               <p>We may ſtill, however, believe, though we
are uncertain, that ſomething exiſts without us;
but we cannot heſitate concerning the real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of every thing within us. The exiſtence
of the ſoul, therefore, is certain, and that of the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0195400702:371"/>
body ſeems to be doubtful. The mind has one
mode of perception when we ſleep, and another
when we are awake; after death, ſhe will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in a manner ſtill more different; and the
objects of ſenſation, or matter in general, may
then have no more exiſtence with regard to her,
than our bodies, with which we have no farther
connection.</p>
               <p>But, though we admit the exiſtence of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that it exiſts in the very manner we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it; yet, on comparing it with the mind, we
ſhall find the latter endowed with qualities ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,
that we cannot heſitate concerning the
difference of its nature, and the ſuperiority of
its rank.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to recogniſe the mind under
any other form than that of thinking, which is
extremely general, ſimple, and uniform. This
form is not diviſible, extended, impenetrable,
nor poſſeſſes any other quality of matter. The
mind, therefore, which is the ſubject of this
form, muſt be indiviſible and immaterial. Our
bodies, on the contrary, as well as all external
objects, have many forms, each of which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
diviſible, and deſtructible; and the
whole are only relative to the different organs
by which we perceive them. Our bodies, and
matter in general, therefore, poſſeſs no conſtant,
real, or univerſal properties, which can enable
us to acquire a certainty of their exiſtence. A
blind man has no idea of the images of bodies
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0195400702:372"/>
preſented to us by means of light. A leper,
whoſe ſkin was inſenſible, could have none of
thoſe ideas which originate from the ſenſe of
feeling. A deaf man knows nothing of ſound.
Suppoſing a perſon to be ſucceſſively deprived
of theſe three inſtruments of ſenſation, the mind
would ſtill exiſt, and manifeſt itſelf by its own
internal power of thinking. But, if you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
colour, extenſion, ſolidity, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
qualities of matter which have a relation to
our ſenſes, matter, in this caſe, would be entirely
annihilated: The mind, therefore, is indeſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible;
but matter may, and muſt periſh.</p>
               <p>The ſame reaſoning applies to the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the mind, when compared with the
moſt eſſential properties of matter. The mind
wills and commands; the body obeys as far as
it is able: The mind can unite itſelf, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
to the moſt diſtant or moſt elevated ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and nothing can prevent this union, when
ſhe commands it to be effected. But the body
is incapable of uniting with any object; it
is wounded by every thing that makes too cloſe
an approach to it. Every thing reſiſts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
an obſtacle to its motions, which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
ſlow. Is this will, then, nothing more
than a corporeal movement; and is contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
only a ſimple contact? How could this
contact be effected with remote objects, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
ſubjects? Or how could this motion be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly
accompliſhed? Without ſpace and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0195400702:373"/>
time, the idea of motion is inconceivable. The
will, therefore, if it be a motion, is not a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
motion; and, if the union of the mind with
its object be a contact, it muſt be a contact, or
rather an intimate penetration, at a diſtance!
qualities which are the reverſe of thoſe of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and which, of courſe, can only belong to
an immaterial being.</p>
               <p>But I am apprehenſive of having dwelt too
long upon a ſubject, which, by ſome, may be
regarded as foreign to the nature of this work.
What connection, it may be ſaid, have metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
remarks on the mind with natural hiſtory?
If I were conſcious of abilities ſufficient for the
diſcuſſion of a topic ſo elevated and extenſive,
this reflection, I acknowledge, would not give
me any uneaſineſs; and I have abridged my
obſervations, ſolely becauſe I deſpaired of being
able to comprehend a ſubject ſo immenſe, and
ſo important in its nature. Why ſhould the
nobleſt part of man be rejected from his hiſtory?
Why thus prepoſterouſly debaſe him, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
him merely as an animal, while his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſo different, and ſo ſuperior to that of the
brutes, that nothing but the moſt brutal igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
could ever dream of confounding them?</p>
               <p>Man, it is true, reſembles the other animals
in the material part of his being; and, in the
enumeration of natural exiſtences, we are obliged
to rank him in the clais of animals. But, in
nature, there are neither claſſes nor genera; all
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0195400702:374"/>
are mere independent individuals. Claſſes and
genera are only the arbitrary operations of
our own fancy: And, though we place man
in one of thoſe claſſes, we change not his nature;
we derogate not from his dignity; we alter not
his real condition; we only aſſign him the firſt
rank among beings which reſemble him ſolely
in the material part of his exiſtence.</p>
               <p>When we compare man with the animal
creation, we find in both a material organized
body, ſenſes, fleſh and blood, motion, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other ſtriking reſemblances. But all theſe
analogies are external, and authoriſe us not to
pronounce, that the nature of man is ſimilar to
that of the brute. In order to acquire a diſtinct
idea concerning the nature of each, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that we ſhould have as complete a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the internal qualities of animals as we
have of our own. But, as it is impoſſible to
know what paſſes within animals, or how to
rank or eſtimate their ſenſations, in relation to
thoſe of man, we can only judge by comparing
the effects which reſult from the natural opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of both.</p>
               <p>Let us, therefore, conſider theſe effects; and,
while we acknowledge all the particular reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,
we ſhall only examine ſome of the moſt
general diſtinctions. The moſt ſtupid man, it
will be admitted, is able to manage the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lert
and ſagacious animal: He governs it, and
makes it ſubſervient to his purpoſes. This he
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0195400702:375"/>
effects not ſo much by ſtrength or addreſs, as by
the ſuperiority of his nature. He compells the
animal to obey him, by his being poſſeſſed of
reaſon, which enables him to project and to act
in a ſyſtematic manner. The ſtrongeſt and moſt
ſagacious animals have not the capacity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the inferior tribes, or of reducing them
to a ſtate of ſervitude. The ſtronger, indeed,
devour the weaker: But this action implies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an urgent neceſſity, and a voracious appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
qualities very different from that which
produces a train of actions all directed to one
common deſign. If animals be endowed with
this faculty, why do not ſome of them aſſume
the reigns of government over others, and force
them to furniſh their food, to watch over them,
and to relieve them when ſick or wounded?
But, among animals, there is no mark of ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
nor the leaſt trace of any of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to recognize or feel a ſuperiority in his
nature above that of other ſpecies. We ſhould,
therefore, conclude, that all animals are of the
ſame nature, and that the nature of man is not
only far ſuperior, but likewiſe of a very different
kind from that of the brute.</p>
               <p>Man exhibits, by external ſigns, what paſſes
within him. He communicates his ſentiments
by words; and this ſign is univerſal. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
and the civilized man have the ſame powers
of utterance; both ſpeak naturally, and are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
underſtood. It is not owing, as ſome
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0195400702:376"/>
have imagined, to a defect in their organs, that
animals are denied the faculty of ſpeech. The
tongue of a monkey has been diſcovered by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts
to be as perfect as that of a man<note n="*" place="bottom">See M. Perault, Hiſtory of Animals.</note>.
The monkey, therefore, would ſpeak, if it could
think. If the train of its thoughts were analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous
to that of ours, it would ſpeak the language
of men; and ſuppoſing the order and manner
of its thinking to be peculiar to the ſpecies, it
would ſtill ſpeak a language intelligible to its
neighbours. But apes have never been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
converſing together. Inſtead, therefore,
of thinking in a manner analogous to man, they
ſeem not to have the ſmalleſt order or train in
their thoughts. As they expreſs nothing that
exhibits combination or arrangement, it follows,
either that they do not think, or that the limits
of their thinking are extremely narrow.</p>
               <p>As ſeveral ſpecies of animals are capable of
being taught to pronounce words, and even to
repeat ſentences, this is an invincible proof that
the want of ſpeech among animals is not owing
to any defect in their organs. Many other
brutes might, perhaps, be taught to articulate
words<note n="†" place="bottom">Leibnitz mentions a dog that had been taught to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſeveral French and German words.</note>; but, to make them conceive the ideas
which theſe words expreſs, is beyond the power
of art. They ſeem to articulate and to repeat
merely like an echo or a machine. They are
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0195400702:377"/>
defective, not in the mechaniſm of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
but in their intellectual powers.</p>
               <p>Language implies a train of thinking; and it
is for this reaſon that brute animals are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſpeech: For, though we ſhould allow them
to poſſeſs ſomething ſimilar to our firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
and to our moſt groſs and mechanical
ſenſations, it is certain that they are unable to
form that aſſociation of ideas in which alone the
eſſence of reflection and of thought conſiſts.
They can neither think nor ſpeak, becauſe they
can neither join nor ſeparate ideas; and, for the
ſame reaſon, they neither invent nor bring any
thing to perfection. If they were endowed with
the power of reflecting, even in the ſlighteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
they would be capable of making ſome
progreſs, and acquire more induſtry; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
race of caſtors would build their houſes with
more art and ſolidity than their progenitors; and
the bee would daily improve the cell which ſhe
inhabits: For, by ſuppoſing that this cell has all
the perfection of which it is capable, we aſcribe
to this inſect a genius and underſtanding ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to the human, by which it is enabled, at one
glance, to perceive the utmoſt point of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to which its work can be carried. But
man never can attain a clear view of this point:
Much time, reflection, and practice, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
before the meaneſt of our arts can be brought
to maturity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0195400702:378"/>
Whence proceeds this uniformity in all the
operations of animals? Why does every ſpecies
perform the ſame work in the very ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?
And why is the execution of different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals
neither better nor worſe than that of
every other? Can there be a ſtronger proof that
their operations are only the reſults of pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
impulſe? If they poſſeſſed a ſingle ſpark
of that inward light which illuminates man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
we ſhould find variety, at leaſt, if not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
in their works; every individual would
exhibit ſome difference in his mode of execution.
But ſuch differences never appear: They all
work upon the ſame plan; their mode of acting
runs through the whole ſpecies, and is not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to any individual: If, therefore, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to animals a mind or ſoul, we muſt allow
but one to every ſpecies, of which each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
has an equal ſhare: This ſoul would, of
courſe, be diviſible, and, conſequently, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and very different from ours.</p>
               <p>Why, on the contrary, is ſo much variety ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in the operations of men? Why does
ſervile imitation coſt us more labour than origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
deſign? Becauſe our ſouls are proper to us,
and independent of any other; and becauſe we
poſſeſs nothing common to the ſpecies, but the
matter which conſtitutes our bodies, and by
which alone we have any reſemblance to the
brute creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0195400702:379"/>
If internal ſenſation depended on corporeal
organs, ſhould not as great a variety appear in
the operations of the ſame ſpecies of animals, as
in thoſe of men? Would not thoſe endowed
with finer organs build their neſts, and their
cells, in a manner more ſolid, elegant, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious?
If any individual had more genius
than another, would it not be rendered conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
by its mode of acting? But nothing of
this kind is ever exhibited: The greater or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
perfection of corporeal organs, therefore, has
no influence upon the nature of internal ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
From this circumſtance, we may ſafely
conclude, that animals poſſeſs no ſenſations of
this kind; that they neither belong to matter,
nor depend, as to their nature, upon the texture
of corporeal organs; and, of courſe, that there
is in man a ſubſtance totally diſtinct from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is the ſubject, and the cauſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
theſe ſenſations.</p>
               <p>But theſe proofs of the immateriality of the
human mind may be extended ſtill farther. We
have often remarked, that Nature proceeds in
her operations by imperceptible degrees. This
truth, which otherwiſe admits of no exception,
is here totally reverſed. Between the faculties
of man, and thoſe of the moſt minute animal,
the diſtance is infinite. This is a clear proof,
that the nature of man is different from that of
the brute creation; that he himſelf conſtitutes a
ſeparate claſs, from which there are numberleſs
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0195400702:380"/>
degrees of deſcent, before we arrive at the ſtate
of the mere animal; for, if man were of the
ſame rank with the animals, there would be in
nature a certain number of beings leſs perfect
than man, and ſuperior to any animal we are
acquainted with; and thoſe intermediate beings
would deſcend imperceptibly from man to the
monkey tribes. But no ſuch beings exiſt. The
paſſage is ſudden from a thinking being to a
material one, from intellectual faculties to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
powers, from order and deſign to blind
impulſe, from reflection and choice to ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
appetite.</p>
               <p>This is a ſtrong indication of the excellence
of our nature, and of the immenſe diſtance fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the bounty of the Creator between men
and animals. Man is a reaſoning being; the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
is totally deprived of that noble faculty:
And, as there is no intermediate point between
a poſitive and a negative, between a rational and
an irrational animal, it is evident that man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is entirely different from that of the animal;
that the latter only reſembles the former in the
external or material part; and that, to form a
judgment from this material reſemblance alone,
is ſhutting our eyes voluntarily againſt that light
which enables us to diſtinguiſh truth from falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>Having conſidered the internal nature of man,
and demonſtrated the immateriality of his ſoul,
we ſhall next examine his external part, and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0195400702:381"/>
give the hiſtory of his body. In the preceding
chapters, we have explained his formation and
expanſion, and traced him to the very moment
of his birth: Let us now run over the different
ages of his life; and, after conducting him to
that period when he is ſeparated from his body,
we ſhall leave it to moulder in the common
maſs of matter to which it originally belonged.</p>

               <p>NOTHING exhibits ſuch a ſtriking pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of weakneſs, of pain, and of miſery,
as the condition of an infant immediately after
birth. Incapable of employing its organs or its
ſenſes, the infant requires every kind of ſuccour
and aſſiſtance: It is more helpleſs than the young
of any other animal: Its uncertain life ſeems e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
moment to vibrate on the borders of death.
It can neither move nor ſupport its body: It
has hardly force enough to exiſt, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
by groans, the pain which it ſuffers; as
if Nature intended to appriſe the little innocent,
that it is born to miſery, and that it is to be
ranked among human creatures only to partake
of their infirmities and of their afflictions.</p>
               <p>Let us not diſdain to conſider that ſtate in
which our exiſtence commenced: Let us view
human nature in the cradle; and, leaving the
diſguſt that might ariſe from a detail of the cares
which infancy demands, let us inquire by what
degrees this delicate and hardly exiſting machine
acquires motion, conſiſtency, and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:0195400702:383"/>
An infant, at birth, paſſes from one element
into another. When it eſcapes from the waters
which ſurrounded it in the womb of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is expoſed to the air, and inſtantly feels
the impreſſions of that active fluid. The air
acts upon the olfactory nerves, and upon the
organs of reſpiration. This action produces a
ſhock, a kind of ſneezing, which expands the
cheſt, and gives the air a free paſſage into the
lungs, the veſicles of which it dilates. After
the air remains for ſome time, it is heated and
rarified to a certain degree, and the ſtimulus or
ſpring ariſing from the dilatation of the fibres
re-acts upon this rarified fluid, and expells it
from the lungs. We will not here attempt to
explain the cauſes of the alternate motion of
reſpiration, but ſhall confine ourſelves to its
effects.</p>
               <p>This function is eſſentially neceſſary to the
exiſtence of man and of many other animals. If
reſpiration ceaſes, the animal muſt periſh; when
once commenced, it never ſtops till death; and,
after the foetus begins to reſpire, it continues
this action without interruption. It is probable,
however, that the foramen ovale of the heart
does not cloſe immediately after birth, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that part of the blood muſt paſs through
that aperture. The whole blood, therefore, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not, at firſt, into the lungs; and a new-born
child may perhaps be deprived of air for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time without ſuffocation. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0195400702:384"/>
ſeems to be confirmed by ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
I lately made upon young dogs. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
a pregnant bitch, of the large gray-hound
kind, and, when juſt about to litter, I fixed her
ſo in a bucket full of warm water, that her hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
parts were entirely covered. In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe brought forth three puppies, which,
after being diſengaged from their membranes,
were immerſed in a fluid nearly of an equal
temperature with that of the amnios. After
aſſiſting the mother, and waſhing the puppies in
this water, I ſuddenly removed them into a pail
of warm milk, without allowing them time to
reſpire. I put them into the milk, in preference
to the water, that they might have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of taking ſome food, if they found a deſire
for it. I kept them immerſed in the milk for
more than half an hour; and, when taken out
of it, all the three were alive. They began to
breathe; and they diſcharged a quantity of fluid
matter by the mouth. I allowed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
about half an hour, and again immerſed
them in the warm milk, where they remained
another half hour. I then took them out: Two
of them were ſtill vigorous; but the third ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to languiſh: I therefore ordered it to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the mother, which, beſides the three
brought forth in the water, had littered other
ſix in the natural manner. The puppy which
was born in the water, and had continued one
half hour in warm milk, before it was allowed
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0195400702:385"/>
to breathe, and another half hour after it had
reſpired, ſeemed to be very little incommoded;
for it ſoon recovered, and was as active and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as thoſe which had received no injury. Of the
ſix that were brought forth in the air, I threw
away four; ſo that there remained only two
with the mother, beſide the one that had been
littered in the water. I continued my experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the other two which had been twice
immerſed in the milk: After allowing them to
breathe about half an hour, I plunged them a
third time into the milk, where they remained
another half hour. Whether they ſwallowed any
of the milk, I could not determine; but, when
removed, they appeared to be nearly as vigorous
as before their immerſion. Having carried them
to the mother, however, one of them died that
ſame day; but I know not whether its death
was owing to ſome accident, or to the injury it
received from being plunged into the milk, and
deprived of air. The other lived as well as the
firſt; and both grew up, and were equally vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
as thoſe which had not been ſubjected to
the experiment. I puſhed theſe trials no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But I learned enough to convince me,
that reſpiration is not ſo indiſpenſibly neceſſary
to the exiſtence of a new-born animal, as to an
adult; and that, by employing certain precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it is, perhaps, poſſible to keep the foramen
ovale open, and, by this means, produce excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
divers, or a ſpecies of amphibious animals,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0195400702:386"/>
which would be able to live equally in air or in
water.</p>
               <p>The air, on its firſt entrance into the lungs,
generally meets with ſome obſtacle, occaſioned
by a fluid ſubſtance collected in the wind-pipe.
This obſtacle is greater or leſs, in proportion to
the viſcidneſs of the liquor. But the infant, at
birth, raiſes its head, which formerly reclined on
its breaſt; and, by this operation, the canal of
the wind-pipe is lengthened; the air, of courſe,
ruſhes in, forces this fluid into the cells of the
lungs, which it dilates; and, in this manner, the
mucous ſubſtance, which oppoſed the free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of the air, is diffuſed through the whole
ſubſtance of the lungs. The perpetual admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of freſh air ſoon dries up this ſuperfluous
moiſture; or, if it ſhould ſtill incommode the
infant, it excites a cough, and is thrown off by
expectoration, which generally runs out of the
mouth, becauſe the child has not yet ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſpit.</p>
               <p>We can remember nothing that paſſes at this
early period of our exiſtence. It is, therefore,
impoſſible to diſcover the feelings produced in
the child by the firſt impreſſions of the air. But
the cries and groans it utters immediately after
birth, are certain indications of the pain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the action of the atmoſphere. Till the
moment of birth, the infant is accuſtomed to the
mild warmth of a tranquil fluid. It is, therefore,
conſonant to reaſon, that the action of a fluid,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0195400702:387"/>
unequal in its temperature, is too violent for the
lax and delicate fibres of a new-born infant. It
is equally ſenſible of heat and of cold: In every
ſituation it utters complaints; and pain appears
to be its firſt and only ſenſation.</p>
               <p>Moſt animals are blind for ſome days after
birth. Infants open their eyes the moment they
come-into the world; but their eyes are fixed
and dull: They have not that luſtre and bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy
they afterwards acquire; neither have they
thoſe motions which accompany diſtinct viſion.
But they ſeem to feel the impreſſion of light;
for the pupil contracts or dilates, in proportion
to the quantity of light. A new-born infant
cannot diſtinguiſh objects; becauſe the organs
of viſion are ſtill imperfect: The cornea is
wrinkled; and perhaps the retina is too ſoft and
lax for receiving the impreſſions of external bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and for producing the ſenſations peculiar
to diſtinct viſion.</p>
               <p>The ſame remark may be applied to the other
ſenſes. They have not yet acquired that force
and conſiſtency which their operation demand:
And, even when they arrive at this ſtate, it is
long before the ſenſations of the infant can be
juſt and complete. The ſenſes are inſtruments
of which we muſt gradually learn the uſe. That
of viſion is the moſt noble, and the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful;
but, at the ſame time, it is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and eluſory. The ſenſations produced
by it, if not rectified every moment by the ſenſe
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0195400702:388"/>
of touching, would uniformly lead us into falſe
concluſions. The ſenſe of touching is the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion
of all the other ſenſes: It alone is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to the animal exiſtence, and is univerſally
diffuſed through every part of the body. But
even this ſenſe is imperfect at birth: A new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
infant, indeed, diſcovers ſymptoms of pain
by its cries and its groans; but it has no expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that indicates pleaſure. It begins not to
ſmile in leſs than 40 days: It is about this time,
likewiſe, that it begins to weep; for its former
cries were not accompanied with tears. There
are no veſtiges of the paſſions in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of a new-born child. The features of the
face have not acquired that conſiſtence and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity
which are neceſſary for expreſſing the
ſentiments of the mind. All the other parts of
the infant's body are extremely feeble; and
their motions are aukward and ill-directed. It
is unable to ſtand erect; its thighs and legs are
ſtill bended, from the habit contracted while in
the womb of the mother; it has not ſtrength
to ſtretch out its arms, or to lay hold of any
thing with its hands; and, if abandoned in this
condition, it would remain on its back without
being able to turn to one ſide or another.</p>
               <p>From theſe remarks it appears, that the pain
felt by infants recently born, and which they
expreſs by crying, is only a corporeal ſenſation,
ſimilar to that of other animals, who likewiſe
cry the moment they are brought forth; and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0195400702:389"/>
that the mental ſenſation commences not ſooner
than 40 days after birth; for ſmiles and tears
are the effects of two internal ſenſations, which
both depend upon the action of the mind. The
former is an agreeable ſenſation, which origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
from the ſight or remembrance of a
known and deſirable object: The latter is a
diſagreeable agitation, compounded of ſympathy
and anxiety concerning our own welfare. Both
theſe paſſions preſuppoſe a certain degree of
knowledge, and a power of reflecting, and of
comparing ideas. Smiles and tears are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of pleaſure and pain peculiar to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſpecies; for the cries, the motions, and
the other marks of bodily pains and pleaſures,
are common to man and moſt of the other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
               <p>But we muſt now return to the material or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and affections of the body. The ſize of an
infant born at the full time is generally about
21 inches, though ſome exceed, and others fall
much below this ſtandard. The breaſt of a
child of 21 inches, meaſured by the length of
the ſternum, is about three inches, and only
two, when the infant exceeds not 14 inches in
length. At nine months, a foetus generally
weighs from 12 to 14 pounds. The head is
large in proportion to the body; but this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
gradually wears off, as the infant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
in ſize. The ſkin of a new-born child
is very fine, and of a reddiſh colour, its tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0195400702:390"/>
allowing a ſlight tint of the blood to
thine through. It is even alledged, that the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſkin of an infant is at birth, it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
become the fairer and more beautiful.</p>
               <p>The form of the body and members of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
recently after birth, is by no means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The parts are too much rounded; and,
even when the child is in high health, they have
a ſwollen appearance. A kind of jaundice ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
comes on at the end of three days; and,
at the ſame time, there is milk in the breaſts of
infants, which is ſqueezed out by the fingers.
As the growth of the child increaſes, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
juices and ſwelling of the parts gradually
diminiſh.</p>
               <p>In ſome infants, a palpitation may be ſeen in
the fontanella, or open of the head; and, in
every child, the beating of the ſinuſes, or arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the brain, may be felt at this place. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
this opening, a ſpecies of ſcurf appears,
which is often very thick, and muſt be rubbed
off with a bruſh, when it becomes dry. This
matter ſeems to have ſome analogy to the horns
of quadrupeds, which likewiſe derive their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
from an opening in the ſkull, and from the
ſubſtance of the brain. We ſhall afterwards
ſhow, that the extremities of the nerves become
ſolid when expoſed to the air; and that horns,
nails, claws, &amp;c. are genuine productions of this
nervous ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:0195400702:391"/>
The fluid contained in the amnios leaves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the infant's body a viſcid whitiſh matter,
which is ſometimes ſo adheſive, that it requires
to be diluted with ſome mild liquid before it
can be removed. In this country, we always
waſh the infant with warm liquors; but there
are whole nations, who inhabit climates much
colder than ours, where the infants are plunged
into cold water as ſoon as they are born, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
receiving the ſmalleſt injury. The Laplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are even ſaid to leave their new-born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
in the ſnow till their reſpiration is almoſt
ſtopped with cold, and then throw them into a
warm bath. This rough treatment is continued
three times every day for the firſt year: And, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that period, the children are bathed thrice a
week in cold water. The inhabitants of the
northern regions are firmly perſuaded, that cold
bathing makes men more healthy and robuſt;
and, therefore, they enure their children to this
habit from their very birth. We are, indeed,
totally ignorant how far our bodies may be
rendered capable of ſuffering, of acquiring, or
of loſing, by the power of habit. The ſavages
in the iſthmus of America, when covered with
ſweet, plunge themſelves into cold water with
impunity: The women throw their drunk huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
into the rivers, in order the more ſpeedily
to remove the effects of intoxication: The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
bathe in cold water along with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
the moment after they are delivered; and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0195400702:392"/>
yet much fewer of them die of child-bearing
than in other countries, where ſuch a practice
would be regarded as extremely dangerous.</p>
               <p>Infants, a few minutes after birth, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
after feeling the heat of a ſire, diſcharge
urine, and likewiſe the meconium or excrement,
which had been formed in the inteſtines during
their abode in the womb. But this laſt evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
does not always happen ſo ſoon; and,
when it is retarded during the firſt day, the
child is often affected with colic pains; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
muſt, therefore, be promoted by proper
remedies. The meconium is black; and, when
it is entirely purged off, the ſtools are of a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
colour. This change generally happens on
the ſecond or third day. The odor of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
becomes then more offenſive than that
of the meconium; which is a proof that the
bile, and other bitter humours of the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be mixed with it.</p>
               <p>The obſervation ſeems to confirm what was
formerly advanced concerning the growth and
nouriſhment of the foetus. We then remarked,
that the foetus was nouriſhed by abſorption,
and that it received no food by the mouth. This
change in the odor of the excrement is a proof
that the ſtomach and inteſtines of the foetus have
no action, or, at leaſt, that they act not in the
ſame manner, as after the motions communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them by reſpiration; ſince it is only after
this period that digeſtion, and the mixture of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0195400702:393"/>
the bile and pancreatic juice with the food, takes
place in the ſtomach and inteſtines. Thus,
though the bile and pancreatic juice are ſecreted
in the foetus, theſe liquors remain in their reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs,
and paſs not into the inteſtines; becauſe,
like the ſtomach, theſe reſervoirs have yet no
motion or action ſufficient to make them empty
their contents into the receptacles of the food.</p>
               <p>Before the child is allowed to ſuck, we allow
it time to diſcharge the ſlime and meconium in
its ſtomach and bowels. As theſe ſubſtances
might ſour the milk, and produce bad effects,
we firſt give the child a little wine and ſugar, in
order to fortify its ſtomach, and to promote ſuch
evacuations as are neceſſary to prepare it for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
and digeſting its food. Ten or twelve
hours, therefore, ought to elapſe, before the
child be allowed to ſuck for the firſt time.</p>
               <p>The infant has hardly eſcaped from the womb
of its mother, and enjoyed the liberty of ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its limbs, when it is again condemned to a
more cruel and unnatural bondage. The head
of the little innocent is fixed; its legs are fetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and its arms are bound down to its ſides;
and it is laced with bandages ſo ſtrait, that it
cannot move a ſingle joint. It is a fortunate
circumſtance, when the ſwaddlings are not
drawn ſo tight as to ſtop reſpiration, or when
the midwife has the ſenſe to lay the miſerable
captive on its ſide, that the natural moiſture may
ſpontaneouſly flow from its mouth; for it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0195400702:394"/>
the liberty of turning its head to facilitate
this natural and neceſſary diſcharge. Is it not
an inſtance of ſuperior wiſdom in thoſe nations,
who ſimply clothe their infants, without torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them with ſwaddling-bands? The Siameſe,
the Indians, the Japaneſe, the Negroes, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
of Canada, of Virginia, of Braſil, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the inhabitants of South America, lay
their infants naked into hanging beds of cotton,
or put them into cradles lined with fur. Theſe
practices are both ſenſible and humane: The
reſtraint of ſwaddling-bands muſt be painful.
The efforts made by infants to diſentangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have a more direct tendency to diſtort
their members, than any poſitions they could aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
if left in the full poſſeſſion of liberty.
Swaddling-bands may be compared to the ſtays
worn by young girls, which occaſion many
more deformities and diſeaſes than they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to prevent.</p>
               <p>If the efforts for liberty made by infants thus
fettered be hurtful, the inactivity to which they
are condemned is, perhaps, ſtill more noxious.
The want of exerciſe retards the growth of their
members, and diminiſhes the ſtrength of their
bodies; and, of courſe, thoſe children who are
allowed full freedom of motion will be the moſt
vigorous and healthy. It was this motive that
induced the Peruvians to leave the arms of their
infants perfectly looſe, in a wide ſwathing-bag:
Afterwards, when their children grew older,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0195400702:395"/>
they put them up to the middle in a hole dug
out of the earth, and lined with linen; their
arms, by this contrivance, were at full liberty;
and they could move their heads, and bend their
bodies, without falling, or hurting themſelves.
As ſoon as they were able to ſtep, the breaſt was
preſented to them at a little diſtance, to entice
them to walk. The children of Negroes are
often expoſed to greater difficulties before they
can approach the nipple; they cling round one
of the mother's hanches with their knees and
legs; they adhere ſo faſt, that they ſupport
themſelves without the aſſiſtance of the mother;
they lay hold of the breaſt with their hands;
and they continue to ſuck without inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or danger of falling, though the mother
moves about or works at her ordinary labour.
Theſe children begin to walk, or rather to creep
on their hands and knees, at the end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
month; and, by exerciſe, they acquire the
faculty of running, in this ſituation, with nearly
equal quickneſs as they do upon their feet.</p>
               <p>Infants, recently after birth, ſleep much; but
their ſleep is often interrupted. As they likewiſe
require frequent nouriſhment, they ought to
have the breaſt once every two hours during the
day, and, in the night, as often as they awake.
At firſt, they ſleep almoſt continually; and they
ſeem never to awake but when ſtimulated by
hunger or pain: Their ſleep, therefore, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
terminates by a fit of crying. As, in the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0195400702:396"/>
cradle, they are obliged to lie in the ſame poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and are chained down by bandages, this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
ſoon becomes painful. They are, beſides,
often wet and chilled by their excrements, the
acrimony of which irritates their delicate and
ſenſible ſkin. In this condition, the efforts of
children are extremely feeble; and their calls
for relief are expreſſed by cries and groans.
This ſuccour ſhould always be ſpeedily admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered;
or rather the inconveniencies they feel
ſhould be prevented, by frequently changing
part of their cloathing. The ſavages are ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
to this article, that, though they cannot
change their furs ſo often as we do our linen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths;
yet they ſupply this defect by employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other ſubſtances, of which they have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to be ſparing. In North America, they
put wood duſt, which they obtain from trees
that have been corroded by worms, into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the cradle, and renew it as often as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:
The children are laid upon this powder,
and covered with ſkins. Though this powder
may, perhaps, be as ſoft as our down-beds; yet
they uſe it not for the purpoſes of delicacy, but
becauſe it quickly abſorbs moiſture of every kind.
In Virginia, they place the child naked upon a
board covered with cotton, and provided with
a hole for the paſſage of the excrement. The
cold in this country is unfavourable to ſuch a
practice; but it is almoſt general in the eaſt of
Europe, and particularly in Turkey. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0195400702:397"/>
has another advantage; it precludes all
kind of care, and prevents the dreadful effects
which too commonly reſult from the common ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence
of nurſes. Nothing inferior to mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
affection can ſupport that perpetual vigilance
and minute attention which the infantine ſtate
requires. With what propriety, then, can ſuch
exertions be expected from ignorant and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
nurſes?</p>
               <p>Some nurſes deſert their children for ſeveral
hours, without feeling the ſmalleſt anxiety: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are ſo callous as not to be affected with
their cries. In this ſituation the unfortunate
infants ſeem to deſpair; they exert all the force
of which they are capable; and their cries only
ceaſe when their ſtrength is exhauſted. This
exceſſive crying either occaſions diſeaſes, or at
leaſt throws them into a ſtate of laſſitude, which
deranges their conſtitutions, and may have ſome
influence on their tempers. Indolent nurſes are
guilty of another abuſe: Inſtead of employing
proper means for pleaſing the child, they rock
it violently in the cradle. This agitation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
the brain, ſtops the crying, and, if long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
ſtuns the child into ſleep. But this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and unnatural ſleep is only a palliative; it
removes not the original cauſe of complaint.
Long and violent rocking, on the contrary, may
diſorder the ſtomach and head, and lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of future diſorders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:0195400702:398"/>
Before putting children into the cradle, we
ought to be certain that they want nothing;
and they ſhould never be rocked with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
as to confound or ſtun them. If they
ſleep not ſufficiently, a gentle and equal motion
may be employed. Neither ſhould they be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
rocked; for, if they be once accuſtomed to
this motion, they will not afterwards ſleep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. Though children, when in health, ſhould
ſleep long without the aſſiſtance of art; yet their
conſtitution may be injured by too much of it.
In this caſe, they ſhould be rouſed by gentle
motion, by ſoft and agreeable ſounds, and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing
them with brilliant objects. This is the
period when they receive the firſt impreſſions
from the ſenſe, which are, perhaps, of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
during life than is generally imagined.</p>
               <p>Infants always direct their eyes to the lighteſt
part of a room; and if, from the child's ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
only one eye can ſee the moſt luminous
part, the other, for want of equal exerciſe, will
not acquire equal ſtrength. To prevent this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
the foot of the cradle, whether the
light proceeds from a window or a candle, ſhould
be placed oppoſite to the light: In this poſition
both eyes receive the light at the ſame time, and
conſequently acquire, by exerciſe, an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſtrength: If one eye acquires more force
than the other, the child will ſquint; for I have
elſewhere proved, that an inequality of ſtrength
in the eyes is the cauſe of ſquinting<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mem. de l'acad. des ſciences, année 1743.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:0195400702:399"/>
For the firſt two months, the infant ſhould
receive no other food than the milk of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or nurſe; and, if its conſtitution be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
this nouriſhment alone ſhould be continued
during the third and fourth month. A child,
however robuſt, may be injured, if any other food
be adminiſtered before the end of the firſt month.
In Holland, in Italy, in Turkey, and through
the whole Levant, children are allowed no other
food during the firſt year. The ſavages of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada
nurſe their children four or five, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſix or ſeven years. In our country, as
moſt nurſes have not a ſufficient quantity of milk
to ſatisfy the deſires of their children, in order
to ſpare it, they give them, even from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
a compoſition of boiled bread and milk.
This nouriſhment appeaſes hunger; but, as the
ſtomach and inteſtines are yet too weak to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
ſuch a groſs viſcid ſubſtance, the children
are greatly hurt by it, and often die of indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
               <p>The mile of animals, in caſes of neceſſity,
may ſupply that of the mother: But then the
child ſhould be obliged to ſuck the animal's teat,
that it may receive the milk in an equal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
degree of heat, and that, by the action of
the muſcles in ſucking, the milk may be mixed
with ſaliva, which greatly promotes digeſtion.
I have known ſeveral peaſants who had no other
nurſes than ewes; and yet they were equally
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0195400702:400"/>
vigorous as thoſe who had been nurſed by their
mothers.</p>
               <p>After two or three months, when the child
has acquired ſome ſtrength, it may have food
ſomewhat more ſolid, as flour baked with milk,
a ſpecies of bread which gradually diſpoſes the
ſtomach to receive common bread, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nouriſhment as it muſt afterwards be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to.</p>
               <p>The conſiſtence of liquid food is thus gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
increaſed, that the child's ſtomach may be
prepared to receive what is ſtill more ſolid. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
during the firſt year, are incapable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication.
The rudiments of the teeth are ſtill
covered with the gums, which are ſo ſoft, that
they can have little effect upon hard ſubſtances.
Some nurſes, eſpecially among the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
firſt chew the food, and then give it to their
children. Before reflecting on this practice, we
muſt throw aſide every idea of diſguſt, of which
children, at this age, have not the leaſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They are equally diſpoſed to receive nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
from the mouth of the nurſe, as from
her breaſts. This cuſtom ſeems to have origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from ſome natural inſtinct, for we meet
with it in many countries which are exceedingly
remote from each other; as in Italy, in Turkey,
in moſt parts of Aſia, in America, in the Antilles,
in Canada, &amp;c. As it is the only way by which
the ſtomachs of children can be ſupplied with a
proper quantity of ſaliva, I believe it is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0195400702:401"/>
to them. If the nurſe chews a bit of bread,
it is ſoaked in her ſaliva, which renders it fitter
for nouriſhment than if it had been diluted in
any other liquor. This practice, however, is
unneceſſary after children are furniſhed with
teeth, which enable them to chew their food,
and to mix it with their own ſaliva.</p>
               <p>The <hi>inciſores,</hi> or cutting-teeth, are eight in
number, four in each jaw, and generally appear
about the ſeventh month, though, in ſome caſes,
not till the end of the firſt year. Theſe teeth
are often premature; for ſome children have
them at birth, and foetuſes have been found with
them completely formed long before the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time of geſtation is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>The rudiments of the teeth are lodged in ſoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
and covered with the gums: In the proceſs
of their growth, they extend their roots to the
bottom of the ſocket, and break through the
gums. This proceſs obſerves not the ordinary
laws of Nature, which act continually on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
body, without occaſioning any painful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
Here Nature makes a violent and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
effort, which is often attended with fatal
conſequences. Children, when teething, loſe
their uſual ſprightlineſs, and become peeviſh and
fretful. The gums are at firſt red and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
and, when the circulation of the blood is
nearly ſtopped by the preſſure of the teeth,
they turn whitiſh. Children perpetually apply
their fingers to the affected part, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0195400702:402"/>
the irritation: To procure ſtill farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
they are furniſhed with a piece of ivory,
coral, or any other hard ſmooth ſubſtance, which
they rub againſt the gums. This operation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes
the parts, affords a momentary ceſſation of
pain, renders the gums thinner, and facilitates
their rupture. But, notwithſtanding every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
the rupture of the gums is always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with pain and danger. When the
gums are uncommonly ſtrong and rigid, they
reſiſt the preſſure of the teeth for a conſiderable
time, and occaſion a violent inflammation, which
often proves fatal. The ſimple operation of
cutting the gum, removes the inflammation, and
gives a free paſſage to the teeth.</p>
               <p>The canine or dog-teeth, which are four in
number, and ſituated next to the cutting-teeth,
generally appear in the ninth or tenth month.
About the end of the firſt, or during the courſe
of the ſecond year, the 16 molares or grinders,
four on each ſide of the canine-teeth, cut the
gums. But theſe periods vary greatly in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
children.</p>
               <p>The cutting-teeth, the dog-teeth, and the firſt
four grinders, are generally ſhed during the
fifth, ſixth, or ſeventh year; and are commonly
replaced in the ſeventh year, though ſometimes
not before the age of puberty. The ſhedding
of theſe 16 teeth is occaſioned by the expanſion
of the rudiments of a ſecond ſet, which are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
at the bottom of the ſockets, and, by
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0195400702:403"/>
their growth, puſh out the firſt ſet. But there
is no ſecond ſet below the other grinders; and,
therefore, they never ſhed but by accident, and
their loſs is ſeldom repaired.</p>
               <p>There are ſtill other four teeth ſituated at the
extremity of each jaw. In ſome perſons, theſe
teeth are entirely wanting: They ſeldom appear
before the age of puberty, and ſometimes not
till a more advanced period. They are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by the name of <hi>Wiſdom-teeth,</hi> and either
appear ſucceſſively, or two at a time. It is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this irregularity in the wiſdom-teeth, that
the number of teeth is not uniformly the ſame,
which varies from 28 to 32. Women, it has
been alledged, have generally fewer teeth than
men.</p>
               <p>Some authors maintain, that the human teeth,
like thoſe of certain animals, would continue to
grow during life, if they were not conſtantly
worn down by grinding the food. But this
notion ſeems to be contradicted by experience;
for people who live upon liquid food have not
longer teeth than thoſe who eat the hardeſt
kinds of aliment. Beſides, thoſe who hold this
opinion, probably miſtake the tuſks of certain
animals for their teeth. The tuſks of the wild
bear, and of the elephant, for example, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to grow during life; but their increaſe,
after they arrive at their natural ſize, is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doubtful. Tuſks have a greater analogy to
horns than to teeth: But this is not a proper
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0195400702:404"/>
place for ſuch diſcuſſions. We ſhall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that, in children, the firſt ſet of teeth are
leſs ſolid, and more looſely fixed in their ſockets,
than the ſecond.</p>
               <p>It has been often aſſerted, that the firſt hair
of children is always brown; and that, after it
falls off, it is replaced by hair of different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
I am unable to determine whether this
remark be well founded; but the hair of moſt
children is fair, and often entirely white. In
ſome it is red, and in others black: But in all
thoſe who are to have fair or brown complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
the hair is more or leſs fair in early infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Thoſe who are to be fair have generally
blue eyes; thoſe who are to be red have yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh
eyes; and thoſe who are to be brown
have eyes of a dark yellowiſh colour: But theſe
diſtinctions are imperfectly marked in children
recently after birth; becauſe their eyes are then
almoſt always blue.</p>
               <p>When infants are allowed to cry long and
violently, ruptures are frequently the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the efforts it makes. Theſe are eaſily
reduced by the application of bandages. But,
if this remedy be too long neglected, the diſeaſe
may continue during life. The limits to which
I have preſcribed myſelf, permit me not to
mention all the diſeaſes incident to children. I
ſhall only remark, on this ſubject, that worms,
with which they are often infeſted, are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from the nature of their food. Milk is a
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0195400702:405"/>
ſpecies of chyle, a purely nutritive ſubſtance,
without any mixture: It, of courſe, conſiſts
entirely of organic and prolific matter, which,
when not properly digeſted by the ſtomach, and
applied to the nouriſhment and growth of the
body, aſſumes, by its natural activity, other
forms, and produces animated beings, or worms,
in ſuch profuſion, that the child is often in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being deſtroyed by them. The bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
occaſioned by worms might perhaps be
prevented, by allowing children to drink a little
wine; becauſe fermented liquors have a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to prevent the generation of worms: They
likewiſe contain few organic nutritive particles;
and it is chiefly by acting on the ſolids, that wine
communicates ſtrength to the body; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
but little nouriſhment. Beſides, moſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are fond of wine; or, at leaſt, they are
eaſily accuſtomed to drink it.</p>
               <p>Though the bodies of infants be extremely
delicate, they are leſs ſenſible of cold than at
any other period of life. Their internal heat,
it would appear, is proportionally greater: The
quickneſs of the pulſe in children ſeems to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
this opinion. Small animals, for the ſame
reaſon, have unqueſtionably more heat than large
ones; for the action of the heart and arteries
increaſes in proportion to the comparative ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of animals. This takes place in the ſame,
as well as in different ſpecies. The pulſe of an
infant, or of a little man, is more frequent than
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0195400702:406"/>
that of an adult, or of a large man. The pulſe
of an ox is ſlower than that of a man; a dog's
pulſe is quicker; and the motion of the heart in
very ſmall animals, as that of a ſparrow, is ſo
rapid that the ſtrokes can hardly be numbered.</p>
               <p>The life of a child, till it be three years of
age, is extremely precarious. In the two or
three ſucceeding years, however, its life becomes
more certain; and, in the ſixth or ſeventh year,
a child has a better chance of living than at any
other period. By conſulting Simpſon's tables
of the degrees of mortality at different ages<note n="*" place="bottom">See Simpſon's tables, publiſhed at London in the 1742.</note>,
it appears, that, of a certain number of children
born at the ſame time, more than a fourth of
them died in the firſt year, more than a third
in two years, and at leaſt one half in the firſt
three years. If this calculation be juſt, when a
child is born, we might lay a bet, that it would
not live above three years. This exhibits a
melancholy view of the human ſpecies; for,
though a man who dies at the age of 21 is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
lamented, as being prematurely deprived
of life; yet, according to theſe tables, one half
of mankind muſt die before the termination of
three years; and, conſequently, every man who
lives more than three years, inſtead of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his fate, ought to conſider himſelf as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
favoured by his Creator. But this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of children is not nearly ſo great in every
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0195400702:407"/>
place as in London: M. Dupré de S. Maur has
demonſtrated, by a number of experiments made
in France, that one half of the children born at
the ſame time are not extinct in leſs than ſeven
or eight years; and, therefore, we might inſure
the life of a new-born child for ſeven or eight
years. When a child arrives at five, ſix, or
ſeven years, it appears, from the ſame experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that its life is more certain than at any
other age; for we may then inſure for 42 years
more. But, in proportion as it advances above
five, ſix, or ſeven years, the number of years it
will probably live conſtantly decreaſes. At 12,
for inſtance, the chance is equal only for 39
years, at 20 for 33<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, at 30 for 28, and ſo on,
till the age of 85, when the chance is equal for
three years more<note n="*" place="bottom">See the tables at the end of this volume.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the growth of the human body, one thing
is exceedingly remarkable. The growth of the
foetus increaſes more and more, in equal times,
till it eſcapes from the womb. The growth of
the child, on the contrary, gradually diminiſhes,
in equal times, till the age of puberty, to which
it makes a ſudden bound, and ſoon acquires its
full ſtature. The foetus, at the end of the firſt
month, is an inch long; at the end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
it is two inches and a quarter; in three
months, it is three inches and a quarter; in four
months, it is more than five inches; in five
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0195400702:408"/>
months, it is ſix and a half, or ſeven inches;
in ſix months, it is eight and a half, or nine
inches; in ſeven months, it is more than 11
inches; in eight months, it is 14 inches; and in
nine months, it is 18 inches. Though theſe
meaſures vary in different ſubjects, yet the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
reſult is, that the foetus, in equal times,
has continued to have a proportionally greater
increaſe. But, if a child at birth be 18 inches
long, it will not acquire, for the next 12 months,
above ſix or ſeven inches more; that is, at the
end of the firſt year, it will be 24 or 25 inches;
in two years it will only be 28 or 29 inches;
in three years it will be no more than 30, or, at
moſt, 32 inches; and afterwards, till the age of
puberty, it will not acquire above one and a
half, or two inches, every year. Thus the foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
grows more in one month, when near the
termination of its abode in the uterus, than the
child does in one year, till it arrives at the age
of puberty, when Nature ſeems to make a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
effort to bring her work to maturity.</p>
               <p>For preſerving the health of children, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and wholeſome nurſes are of the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
We have too many melancholy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of certain diſeaſes being communicated
from the nurſe to the child, and from the child
to the nurſe. Whole villages have, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
been infected with the venereal virus.</p>
               <p>Children, it is probable, would be much more
ſtrong and vigorous, if they were nurſed by
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0195400702:409"/>
their mothers, whoſe milk muſt be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them than that of any other woman;
for the foetus is nouriſhed in the womb with a
liquor which has a great reſemblance to the
milk in the breaſts. Thus the infant is, in ſome
meaſure, accuſtomed to the milk of the mother,
even before its birth. But the milk of another
woman is not only new to it, but is often of ſo
different a nature, that it is difficult to reconcile
the child to the uſe of it. We ſometimes ſee
children, who cannot digeſt the milk of certain
women, languiſh and turn diſeaſed; and, if
they are not ſpeedily ſupplied with another nurſe,
they ſoon periſh.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more deſtructive to children
than the practice of crowding numbers of them
into the ſame hoſpital. Moſt of them die of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
diſeaſes, which they would certainly
eſcape, if they were brought up in ſeparate
houſes, and particularly at a diſtance from great
towns. The ſame expence would be ſufficient
to ſupport them; and numberleſs citizens, which
conſtitute the riches of a ſtate, would, by this
ſimple and natural mode of treatment, be ſaved
to the public.</p>
               <p>Children begin the difficult taſk of learning
to ſpeak about the 12th or 15th month. They
pronounce the vowel A with moſt facility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it requires only the opening of the mouth,
and forcing out the air. E requires the tongue
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0195400702:410"/>
to be raiſed, at the ſame time that the lips are
opened. In pronouncing I, the tongue is ſtill
more elevated, and approaches the teeth of the
upper jaw. O requires the tongue to be depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and the lips contracted; and, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of U, the lips muſt be ſtill more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
and ſomewhat extended. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants
articulated by children are thoſe which
require the leaſt motion of the organs. B, M,
and P, are moſt eaſily pronounced. B and P
only require the lips to be joined, and then
opened with celerity; and for M, they muſt be
firſt opened, and then quickly ſhut. The arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the other conſonants cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
without more complicated movements.
The pronunciation of C, D, G, L, N, Q, R, S,
and T, depends upon particular motions of the
tongue, which are not eaſily deſcribed. F re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a prolongation of ſound beyond any of
the other conſonants. Thus, of the vowels, A
is moſt eaſily pronounced; and, of the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
B, P, and M. It is for this reaſon that
children, in all countries, firſt begin to articulate
the words <hi>Baba, Papa, Mama.</hi> Theſe words are
the moſt natural, only becauſe they are moſt
eaſily pronounced; and the letters of which
they are compoſed muſt exiſt in every language.</p>
               <p>It is worthy of remark, however, that, as the
ſounds of ſeveral conſonants are very ſimilar,
as thoſe of B and P, of C and S, of K and Q, of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0195400702:411"/>
D and T, of F and V, of G and J, of G and K,
and of L and R, there may be many languages
in which theſe different conſonants are not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploved.
But, in every language, a B or a P, a
C or an S, a K or a Q, a D or a T, an F or a
V, a G or a J, an L or an R, are indiſpenſible;
and, in the moſt contracted alphabets, there muſt
be at leaſt ſix or ſeven conſonants; becauſe the
articulation of them is not complicated, and the
ſounds by which they are uttered are all diſtinct
and different from each other. Children who
cannot eaſily pronounce R, ſubſtitute L in place
of it, and T in place of D; becauſe the former
are more difficult to articulate than the latter:
And the ſoftneſs or harſhneſs of a language, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the choice of conſonants which are more
or leſs difficult to pronounce. But it is needleſs
to enlarge upon this ſubject.</p>
               <p>Some children, at two years of age, articulate
diſtinctly, and repeat whatever is ſaid to them;
but moſt children require a longer time. It has
been remarked, that thoſe who are long before
they learn to ſpeak, never articulate with the
ſame facility as thoſe who acquire that faculty
more early. The latter may be taught to read
before they are three years of age; and I have
known children read amazingly at four. But,
after all, it is difficult to determine whether any
advantages are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> derived from ſuch premature
inſtruction. We have had ſo many examples of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0195400702:412"/>
prodigies of learning at four, at eight, at twelve,
and at ſixteen years, who turned out to be either
fools, or men of very little ability, at twenty-five,
that I am inclined to think, that the moſt
common mode of education, by which Nature is
not prematurely forced, and which is diſcreetly
proportioned to the ſtrength and capacity of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
is ſtill the beſt.</p>

               <p>PUBERTY commences where childhood
ends, and accompanies us through the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
periods of life. Before puberty, Nature ſeems
to have had nothing in view but the growth and
preſervation of her work. The proviſion ſhe
has made for the infant extends no farther than
the nouriſhment and expanſion of its members.
It lives, or rather enjoys a kind of vegetable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
which is confined to itſelf, and which it
cannot communicate. But the principles of life
ſoon multiply: We are ſoon poſſeſſed of a ſtock,
ſufficient not only for our own being, but which
enables us to beſtow exiſtence upon others. This
redundancy of life, the ſource of health and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
can no longer be confined, but is ſtrongly
impelled to expand and diffuſe itſelf. The age
of puberty is accompanied with ſeveral external
and internal marks. It is the ſpring of life; the
ſeaſon of pleaſure. May we be enabled to write
the hiſtory of this critical period, without exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any ideas but what are ſtrictly philoſophical!
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0195400702:414"/>
In the hiſtory of man, puberty, circumciſion,
caſtration, virginity, impotence, and many other
circumſtances, are articles too eſſential to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
We ſhall, therefore, endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
them with that delicacy of ſtyle, that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
apathy, which annihilate every looſe
deſire, and beſtow on words nothing more than
their ſimple and primitive ſignification.</p>
               <p>Circumciſion is a cuſtom of great antiquity, and
is ſtill practiſed over the greateſt part of Aſia. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Hebrews, the operation was performed
eight days after birth. In Turkey, it is delayed to
the ſeventh or eighth year, and ſometimes to the
eleventh or twelfth. The children in Perſia
are circumciſed at the age of five or ſix; the
wound is healed with cauſtic or aſtringent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and burnt paper is very generally uſed,
which, according to Chardin, is the beſt remedy.
This author tells us, that the operation, when
performed on grown perſons, is attended with
conſiderable pain: That they are obliged to be
confined to the houſe three or four weeks; and
that death is ſometimes the conſequence.</p>
               <p>In the Maldivia iſlands, children are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
at the age of ſeven years. To render the
ſkin ſoft, they are bathed in the ſea ſix or ſeven
hours before the operation. The Iſraelites made
uſe of a ſharp ſtone: The Jews obſerve the ſame
mode in moſt of their ſynagogues. But the
Mahometans employ a knife or a razor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:0195400702:415"/>
An operation ſimilar to circumciſion is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in certain diſeaſes. It is a common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the prepuces of the Turks, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nations where circumciſion is practiſed,
would naturally grow too long, if they were
not curtailed in childhood. Boulaye ſays, that
he has ſeen, in the deſerts of Arabia and Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,
on the banks of the Tigris and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,
numbers of Arabian boys whoſe prepuces
were ſo long as to render them incapable of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
without the aid of circumciſion.</p>
               <p>The people of the Eaſt have likewiſe longer
eye-lids than the inhabitants of other nations.
The ſkin of the eye-lids reſembles that of the
prepuce. But what relation can take place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the growth of thoſe diſtant parts?</p>
               <p>Girls as well as boys are circumciſed, upon
the borders of the Perſic Gulph and the Red Sea.
But theſe people never perform the operation
till the girls have paſſed the age of puberty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is no redundance before that period.
In other climates, the exceſs of growth in the
nymphae appears more early; and is ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
among certain people, as thoſe upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Benin, that they circumciſe both girls and
boys eight or ten days after birth. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of females was an antient cuſtom, even in
Africa. Herodotus mentions it among the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of the Aethiopians.</p>
               <p>Circumciſion may, therefore, be founded on
neceſſity; it has, at leaſt, propriety for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0195400702:416"/>
But <hi>infibulation</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This word ſignifies the operation of tying or ſewing parts together.</note> and caſtration muſt have
ariſen from jealouſy alone. Theſe ridiculous
and cruel operations have been invented by
gloomy and fanatical tyrants, who, actuated by
a mean envy, and a deſire of monopolizing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
pleaſures, enacted and enforced thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and bloody laws, which make privation
a virtue, and mutilation meritorious.</p>
               <p>Boys are infibled by drawing the prepuce
forward, piercing it, and putting a ſmall cord
through the holes, which remains till the cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice
of the oppoſite ſides be formed: The cord
is then removed, and a ring ſubſtituted in its
place, which is made of ſufficient ſtrength to laſt
as long as the perſon who ordered the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
pleaſes; and ſometimes it remains for life.
The eaſtern monks, who take on the vow of
chaſtity, employ a large ring, which renders a
breach of their oath impoſſible. We ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
mention the method of infibling fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males.
It is impoſſible to imagine any thing
too ridiculous upon this ſubject, which has not
been practiſed by ſome men, either from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of paſſion or of ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>During infancy, there is ſometimes but one
teſticle in the ſcrotum, and ſometimes none. We
muſt not, however, conclude that children in
this ſituation are totally deſtitute of theſe parts.
It often happens, that the teſticles remain in the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0195400702:417"/>
abdomen, or are entangled in the rings of the
muſcles. But time generally removes theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles;
and the teſtes deſcend into their proper
receptacle at the age of eight or ten, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not till the ſeaſon of puberty. Parents,
therefore, have no reaſon to be anxious about
ſuch of their children as ſeemingly have no te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,
or but one. The teſticles of adults are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
concealed; becauſe nature, at the age of
puberty, makes ſtrong efforts to bring them to
light. The ſame effect is ſometimes produced
by diſeaſe, or violent motion, ſuch as a leap, a
fall, &amp;c. Even when the teſticles never make
their appearance, the purpoſes of generation are
not fruſtraetd. Men of this kind are often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with uncommon vigour.</p>
               <p>There are men who have but one teſticle.
This defect, however, is inoffenſive; for it is
always uncommonly large. Some men have
three, and are, on that account, ſaid to poſſeſs
more vigour and bodily ſtrength. We learn,
from the animal creation, how greatly theſe
parts contribute to ſtrength and courage. How
different is an ox from a bull, a wedder from a
ram, and a capon from a cock?</p>
               <p>The practice of caſtration among mankind is
very extenſive, and of great antiquity. It was
the puniſhment of adultery among the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.
In the Roman dominions, the number of
cunuchs was conſiderable: At this day, theſe
mutilated males are employed through all Aſia
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0195400702:418"/>
and part of Africa, as guards upon the chaſtity
of the ladies. In Italy, this infamous, this cruel
operation, has nothing for its object but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the voice. The Hottentots cut
off one teſticle, becauſe they imagine that this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
renders them more ſwift in the chace.
In other countries, the poor people mutilate their
children, to make them incapable of procreation,
and to prevent them from feeling thoſe excruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
pangs which they themſelves ſuffer, when
they want bread to ſupport them.</p>
               <p>The ſpecies of caſtration vary according to the
object in view. When the improvement of the
voice is intended, the two teſticles are only cut
out. But men, whoſe minds are inflamed with
jealouſy, would not believe their females to be
ſafe in the cuſtody of ſuch eunuchs: They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
none but ſuch as have been deprived of the
whole external parts of generation.</p>
               <p>But amputation is not the only means of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
this end. Formerly, the growth
of the teſticles was prevented, and their ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
deſtroyed, without any inciſion: They ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
the infants in warm water and decoctions
of plants, and then preſſed and rubbed the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
for a long time, in order to deſtroy their
texture. Others compreſſed them with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument:
Some pretend, that this ſpecies of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
does not endanger life.</p>
               <p>The amputation of the teſticles is not very
dangerous: It may be done at any age; the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0195400702:419"/>
time of infancy, however, is always preferable.
But the amputation of the whole external parts
of generation is often fatal, eſpecially if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
after the age of fifteen years. Even in
the moſt favourable time, which is from ſeven
to ten years of age, there is always great danger.
The difficulty of preſerving eunuchs of this kind
render them exceedingly precious. Tavernier
informs us, that in Turkey, and Perſia, they bring
five or ſix times the price of the other kind.
Chardin obſerves, that the total amputation is
accompanied with the moſt exquiſite pain; that
it is performed pretty ſafely upon young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
and is exceedingly dangerous after the
age of fifteen; that hardly a fourth part eſcape
with life; and that the wound is never cured in
leſs than ſix weeks. On the other hand, Pietro
della Valle aſſerts, that thoſe who ſuffer this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
in Perſia for rapes, and other crimes
of that nature, heal eaſily, though advanced in
years; and that they apply nothing but aſhes to
the wound. I know not whether thoſe who
underwent the ſame puniſhment in Aegypt, as
Diodorus Siculus relates, eſcaped with equal eaſe.
According to Thevenot, vaſt numbers of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,
who are forced by the Turks to ſubmit to
this operation, periſh, even when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
on children of eight or ten years of age.</p>
               <p>Beſides negro eunuchs, there are others at
Conſtantinople, throughout all Turkey, Perſia,
&amp;c. who, for the moſt part, are brought from
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0195400702:420"/>
the kingdom of Golconda, the peninſula on this
ſide the Ganges, the kingdoms of Aſſan, Aracan,
Pegu, and Malabar, where their colour is gray;
and from the Gulf of Bengal, where they are
of an olive colour: There are ſome white eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs
from Georgia and Circaſſia; but their
number is ſmall. Tavernier ſays, that, when
he was in the kingdom of Golconda, in the year
1657, 22000 males were caſtrated. The black
eunuchs come from Africa, and eſpecially from
Aethiopia. In proportion to the ugglineſs and
horror of their appearance, they are the more
eſteemed, and bring a higher price. A very flat
noſe, a frightful aſpect, large thick lips, and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, black teeth placed at a great diſtance
from each other, are admired qualities in a eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch.
Theſe people have commonly fine white
teeth: But ſuch teeth would be a capital defect
in a eunuch, who ought to be a hideous mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>Eunuchs, who are only deprived of their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
have a lively ſenſe of titulation in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains:
They have even the external ſign more
frequently than other men. The part which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
however, is generally ſmall; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
nearly in the ſame ſtate in which it was
before the operation. A eunuch caſtrated at
ſeven years of age, when arrived at 20, is no
better, with regard to this affair, than a child of
ſeven. Thoſe, on the other hand, who have
not undergone the operation till the age of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0195400702:421"/>
or later, have parts nearly equal to thoſe
of ſound men.</p>
               <p>Peculiar relations ſubſiſt between the throat
and the parts of generation, though we are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
ignorant of their cauſes. Eunuchs have
no beard; their voice, though ſtrong and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
can never reach a low or deep tone. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
diſeaſes often appear in the throat. The
remarkable ſympathy which ſome parts of the
body have with others, though at a diſtance,
and of a different nature, is a ſubject too much
neglected: We are apt to deſpiſe effects, when
we cannot eaſily diſcover their cauſes. Hence
it is, that we never think of examining theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
or ſympathies, although they are the
proper ſpring of the animal conſtitution. In
females, there is a remarkable ſympathy between
the uterus, breaſts, and head. How many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and uſeful facts of this nature might be
diſcovered, if phyſicians paid more attention to
this intereſting ſubject? It would produce more
enlightened views, and a more extenſive utility,
than can ever be expected from a mere regiſter
of anatomical names. It is impoſſible to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the principles of animal motion: The ſprings
which give life to organization are not to be
found in the muſcles, veins, arteries, and nerves,
deſcribed with ſuch minuteneſs by anatomiſts.
Organized bodies are poſſeſſed of internal powers,
upon which the groſs laws of mechaniſm have
no influence. Inſtead of attempting to diſcover
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0195400702:422"/>
theſe powers, by attending to their effects, they
have been treated as ideal exiſtences; they have
ceaſed to be the objects of philoſophical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch.
They have at laſt reaſſumed their native
importance in the laws of gravitation, in elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
attractions, in the phaenomena of electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
&amp;c. But, notwithſtanding the evidence
and univerſality of their exiſtence, as their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is internal, as they are ſolely objects of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and have little connection with the ſenſes,
they are in danger of eſcaping our obſervation,
and we admit them with difficulty; for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is generally occupied and directed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
objects. We never imagine that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
conſtitution of animated beings ought to
be a principal object of inquiry. We conceive
that the human genius is limited to external
objects; and, therefore, we overlook every thing
that might lead to a more refined and ſpiritual
philoſophy.</p>
               <p>The antients, leſs limited in genius, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of a more comprehenſive philoſophy, were
not aſtoniſhed to meet with facts which were
inexplicable: They viewed Nature through a
more tranſparent medium. A peculiar corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
or ſympathy, was to them only a
phaenomenon; but, to us, becauſe not reducible
to ſome fanciful laws of motion, it is a paradox.
They knew that Nature produced her principal
effects by laws concealed from human eyes:
They knew, that, to trace her various laws and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0195400702:423"/>
modes of operation, exceeded the powers of our
circumſcribed faculties. A certain number of
uniform and related effects, therefore, was to
them ſufficient to conſtitute a cauſe, or law of
nature. Whether, according to the antients,
this ſympathy ſhall be called a peculiar corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
between different parts of the body,
or, according to the moderns, it ſhall be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as an unknown relation in the action of
nerves, its exiſtence in the animal oeconomy is
univerſal; its effects, therefore, are of the utmoſt
importance to the theory of medicine, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be too diligently ſcrutinized. But this is not
the place for a full inveſtigation of ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
ſubject. I ſhall only obſerve, that the
relation between the voice and the generative
organs takes place not only in eunuchs, but in
other men: It is even diſcoverable in females.
In men, the voice changes at the age of puberty;
and in women, who have a ſtrong rough voice,
the paſſion of love is ſuſpected to be violent.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſymptom of puberty is a ſenſe of
fullneſs and ſtiffneſs in the groins; which is moſt
perceptible when walking, or when the body is
bent forward. This ſtiffneſs is often accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with pretty ſmart pain in the different joints
of the limbs: It is likewiſe accompanied with a
new and peculiar ſenſation in thoſe parts which
diſtinguiſh the ſexes. Small whitiſh tubercles
alſo begin to appear in theſe parts, which are the
germs of their natural veil. The voice, for a
conſiderable time, is rough and unequal; after
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0195400702:424"/>
which it becomes more full, articulate, and ſtrong.
This change is very conſpicuous in boys; but it
is leſs diſtinguiſhable in girls, becauſe their voices
are naturally more ſharp.</p>
               <p>Theſe marks of puberty are common to both
ſexes: But each ſex has marks peculiar to itſelf;
as the eruption of the menſes, and the expanſion
of the breaſts in women; the beard and faculty
of procreating in men. Theſe marks, indeed,
are not always uniform. The beard, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
does not always appear preciſely at the
age of puberty: There are even whole nations
who have hardly any beard. On the contrary,
there is no country where the age of puberty in
women is not diſtinguiſhed by the enlargement
of the breaſts.</p>
               <p>Among every race of mankind, the females
arrive at puberty ſooner than the males. But
the age of puberty is very different in different
countries. It ſeems to depend upon the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
of the climate and the quality of the food.
The children of citizens and of opulent parents,
who are generally fed with rich and nouriſhing
victuals, arrive ſooner at this ſtate. But chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
brought up in the country, or whoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are poor, require two or three years long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
becauſe their food is not only bad, but given
too ſparingly. In the ſouthern parts of Europe,
and in cities, girls arrive at puberty about the
age of 12, and boys about 14. But, in northern
climates, and in the country, girls hardly come
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0195400702:425"/>
to maturity till they are 14, and boys not before
16.</p>
               <p>It may be aſked, Why are the females, in all
climates, capable of procreating ſooner than the
males? The anſwer is eaſy: The bodies of men
are larger and ſtronger; their bones are harder,
and their muſcles more compact; a longer time
is therefore neceſſary for their growth. Beſides,
as the growth of the body muſt be nearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
before a ſuperfluous quantity of organic
juices can be accumulated in the parts deſtined
for generation, women, of courſe, muſt arrive
at maturity ſooner than men.</p>
               <p>In the warmeſt climates of Aſia, Africa, and
America, the age of puberty commences in girls
at ten, and ſometimes at nine. The periodic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
though leſs abundant in warm climates,
appears much ſooner. The interval is nearly the
ſame in all nations. With regard to time, a
greater diverſity takes place between individuals
than between nations. In the ſame climate and
nation, ſome females ſuffer this evacuation every
15 days; others have an interval of ſix weeks:
But a month, or a few days more or leſs, is the
moſt uſual period.</p>
               <p>The quantity evacuated ſeems to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the quantity of nouriſhment and of inſenſible
perſpiration. The diſcharge is greateſt in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
who eat largely and take little exerciſe:
It is leaſt in warm countries, where the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is more copious. The quantity of this
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0195400702:426"/>
diſcharge has been variouſly eſtimated. It is
indeed difficult to make an accurate meaſure. In
different ſubjects, and different circumſtances, it
varies from one or two ounces to a pound, and
even more. It generally continues to flow three,
four, or five days; but ſometimes it remains for
ſix, ſeven, and even eight days. The cauſe of
this diſcharge is generally aſcribed to a ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of blood and nutritious juices. The ſymptoms
which precede it are certain indications of a
plethora, as heat, tenſion, ſwelling, and the
pains felt not only in the parts themſelves, and
their environs, but in the mammae, which alſo
ſwell, and diſcover a ſuperabundance of blood
by the colour of the areolae becoming then more
deep: The eyes likewiſe are heavy, and the ſkin
below the orbits takes on a faint blue or a violet
colour: The cheeks glow; the head is heavy
and affected with pain; and, in a word, the
whole body is oppreſſed with a ſurcharge of
blood.</p>
               <p>The growth of the body, in length, generally
terminates at the age of puberty. Before this
period, young people commonly ſhoot up ſeveral
inches in a very ſhort time. But the quickneſs
of growth is moſt remarkable in the parts of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of both ſexes. In males, this growth
is only an augmentation in ſize: But, in females,
it often produces a ſhrinking of ſome of the
parts, which has received different appellations
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0195400702:427"/>
from thoſe who have treated of the ſigns of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity.</p>
               <p>Men, jealous of pre-eminence of every kind,
have always diſcovered a remarkable attachment
to prior and excluſive poſſeſſions. This ſpecies
of folly has beſtowed a phyſical exiſtence upon
female virginity. Virginity, which is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
being, a virtue exiſting ſolely in purity of
heart, has been metamorphoſed into a phyſical
object, in which moſt men think themſelves
deeply intereſted. This notion, accordingly, has
given riſe to many abſurd opinions, cuſtoms, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and ſuperſtitions; it has even given
authority to pains and puniſhments, to the moſt
illicit abuſes, and to practices which ſhock huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Young women have been obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the examinations of ignorant matrons,
and to expoſe the ſecrets of nature to the eyes
of prejudiſed phyſicians. They did not reflect,
that every indecency of this kind is a violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
againſt chaſtity; that every ſituation which
produces an internal bluſh, is a real proſtitution.</p>
               <p>I have little hope of being able to eradicate
the ridiculous prejudices which have been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on this ſubject. Mankind always believe
what they wiſh to be true, however vain and
unreaſonable the foundations of their faith. But,
as it is the province of hiſtory to narrate not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſucceſſion of events, and the circumſtances
of facts, but likewiſe the origin of popular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and errors, I think it a neceſſary article in
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0195400702:428"/>
the hiſtory of man, to examine this favourite i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
which he adores, to conſider the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his worſhip, and to inquire whether Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity
be a real or a fabulous divinity.</p>
               <p>Fallopius, Veſalius, Diemerbroek, Riolan,
Bartholin, Heiſter, Ruyſch, and ſome other ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts,
maintain, that the membrane of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
has a real exiſtence, and that it ought to be
reckoned among the parts of generation peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to females. They aſſert, that it is a fleſhy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,
very thin in infants, but thicker in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dults;
that it is ſituated under the orifice of the
urethra, and nearly ſhuts up the entrance of the
vagina; that it is perforated by a round or
oval hole, ſo ſmall as hardly to admit a pea
during infancy, or a large bean at the age of
puberty. The hymen, according to Winſlow,
is a membranous fold, ſometimes circular, and
ſometimes ſemilunar, with an aperture of a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
or greater ſize in different ſubjects, &amp;c. On
the other hand, Ambroſe Paré, Dulaurent, Graaf,
Pineus, Dionis, Mauriceau, Palfyn, and other
anatomiſts of equal authority with thoſe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned, inſiſt, that the membrane of the
hymen is a mere chimera; that it is not natural
to young girls; and expreſs their aſtoniſhment
that any man ſhould talk of it as a thing which
has a real and uniform exiſtence. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a multitude of experiments and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made upon ſubjects of different ages, in
which they could never diſcover any appearance
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0195400702:429"/>
of this membrane. They acknowledge, that
they have ſometimes, but very ſeldom, ſeen thoſe
fleſhy protuberances called carunculae myrti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
connected by a membrane; but they
maintain that this membrane was preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
Anatomiſts are not leſs divided with regard
to the number and qualities of theſe carunculae.
Are they only rugoſities of the vagina? Are they
diſtinct and ſeparate parts? Are they the remains
of the hymen? Is their number uniform? Does
only one, or many, accompany the ſtate of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity?
All theſe queſtions have been ſtated, and
each has received a different ſolution.</p>
               <p>This oppoſition of ſentiment, in a matter
which depends on inſpection, is an inconteſtible
proof, that mankind have often an ardent deſire
to diſcover things in Nature which exiſt only in
their own imaginations. Many anatomiſts of
reputation have never been able to diſcover ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the hymen or carunculae, even before the
age of puberty. Thoſe who ſupport the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinion, at the ſame time acknowledge,
that theſe parts are not always the ſame; that
their form, ſize, and texture, vary in different
ſubjects; that, in place of the hymen, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
there is but one caruncula, at other times
there are two or more united by a membrane;
that the ſhape of the aperture is not uniform,
&amp;c. What is the conſequence? We muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the cauſes of this mark of virginity
are equivocal and inconſtant; and that, even
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0195400702:430"/>
when they have exiſtence, they produce only an
effect of a tranſient and variable nature. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
determines nothing with regard to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of the hymen and carunculae; it allows
us to reject theſe ſymptoms of virginity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not only uncertain, but imaginary.</p>
               <p>The effuſion of blood, though a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſymptom, is not leſs equivocal. It has, in
all ages, been regarded as an infallible proof of
virginity. But it amounts to nothing, in all
thoſe caſes where the entrance of the vagina is
naturally relaxed or dilated. Beſides, the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of blood is not peculiar to virgins. Women
who have no pretenſions to virginity frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
experience this diſcharge. Some diſcharge
copiouſly and often; others a ſmall quantity,
and only once; and ſome have no ſuch effuſion.
This phaenomenon depends upon age, health,
ſtructure of parts, and a number of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Of theſe we ſhall only enumerate a few,
and endeavour, at the ſame time, to inveſtigate
the true cauſes of the various phyſical marks
which have been held forth as infallible charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtics
of female virginity.</p>
               <p>At the time of puberty, the parts of both
ſexes undergo a conſiderable change: Thoſe of
the male have then a growth ſo quick, that they
arrive, in a year or two, at full maturity. Thoſe
of women increaſe likewiſe at this period. The
nymphae, in particular, which, though formerly
almoſt imperceptible, now become full and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0195400702:431"/>
The menſtrual diſcharge appears at
the ſame period. By an uſual accumulation
of blood, all the parts ſwell, and approach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
each other. The orifice of the vagina
contracts, though the dimenſions of the vagina
itſelf be enlarged. The appearances produced
by this contraction are different in different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
for we are informed by anatomiſts, that
there are ſometimes four, and ſometimes only
three, or two, <hi>carunculae</hi>; and that a circular or
ſemilunar ring, or rather a ſeries of folds, is a
common phaenomenon. But anatomiſts have
neglected to tell us, that, whatever form this
contraction aſſumes, it never appears before the
age of puberty. In young girls, whom I have
had occaſion to diſſect, nothing of this kind
could be diſcerned; and, having collected many
facts concerning this ſubject, I can with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
aſſert, that, when young women, before
puberty, have commerce with men, no effuſion
of blood ever happens, unleſs the parts be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſproportioned, or ſome violence is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
On the other hand, at the time of puberty,
eſpecially when the females are regular, and in
good health, theſe effuſions are common, and
produced by the ſlighteſt cauſes. But thoſe
who are meagre, and ſubject to the fluor albus,
generally want this mark of virginity. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
repetition of this flux of blood, and even
at conſiderable intervals of time, is an evident
demonſtration that it is only a deceitful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0195400702:432"/>
It is a certain fact, that young women,
who at firſt had a copious effuſion, have repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this pretended ſymptom of virginity after a
few months abſtinence. This phaenomenon
may, by proper management, be frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
eſpecially before the body has acquired
its full growth. It is equally certain, that young
women, who have not been faithful to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-bed,
have, notwithſtanding, by the ſimple
expedient of abſtinence, given freſh proofs of
innocence to their deluded huſbands. Some
women, in the courſe of two or three years, have
exhibited this fictitious mark of purity five times.
But this ſymptom is limited to a certain time;
for it ſeldom appears after the age of eighteen
years. When the growth of the body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
its parts become fixed and unalterable,
and cannot aſſume differences but by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of ſuch artifices as it would be both
unneceſſary and improper to relate. Beſides,
many women, particularly thoſe who are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
in their menſes, and ſubject to the fluor
albus, never have any freſh marks of virginity.</p>
               <p>Nothing, therefore, can be more chimerical
than the prejudices of men with regard to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,
and nothing can be more fallacious than
the pretended ſigns of it. A young woman may
have commerce with a man before the age of
puberty, and yet exhibit no marks of virginity.
But the ſame woman, after ſhe arrives at puber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
may have very copious effuſions of blood.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0195400702:433"/>
Others, who are actual virgins, diſcover no ſuch
appearances. Men, therefore, ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
eaſy as to this matter, and not indulge, as
is too often the caſe, unjuſt and ridiculous ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions.</p>
               <p>If we wiſh to obtain an evident and infallible
mark of virginity, we muſt ſearch for it among
thoſe barbarous people, who are incapable of
inſtilling, by education, the ſentiments of virtue
and honour into their children, but ſecure the
chaſtity of their daughters by an expedient which
could only be ſuggeſted by the rudeneſs of their
manners. In Aethiopia, and other parts of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
in Pegu, Arabia Petrea, and other nations of
Aſia, the inhabitants, immediately after the birth
of females, ſew up thoſe parts which Nature has
ſeparated, leaving only a ſpace ſufficient for the
natural evacuations. As the child grows, the
parts gradually adhere, and, when the time of
marriage arrives, they are again diſunited by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.
Inſtead of thread, the fibres of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſtos
are ſaid to be employed, which is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
not liable to ſudden corruption. Some
tribes content themſelves with putting a ring
through the parts. To this operation wives as
well as girls are ſubjected, with this difference,
that the ring allotted to the latter cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
but in that allotted to the former, there
is a lock, of which the huſband alone poſſeſſes
the key. But why ſhould we mention barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
nations, when we have ſimilar examples at
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0195400702:434"/>
no great diſtance? That abſurd delicacy of a
neighbouring nation, with regard to the chaſtity
of their wives, is the offspring of a brutal and
criminal jealouſy.</p>
               <p>How oppoſite are the taſtes, the diſpoſitions,
the opinions, and the manners of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
After what has been related concerning
the high eſtimation of virginity among the bulk
of mankind, and the numberleſs precautions and
ignominious methods employed to ſecure it, is
it poſſible to believe that there are other people
who deſpiſe virginity, and conſider the trouble
of removing it to be a mean and ſervile office?</p>
               <p>Superſtition has induced the inhabitants of
certain countries to reſign the firſt fruits of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity
to their idolatrous prieſts, and ſometimes
to the idols themſelves. This privilege is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the prieſts of Cochin and of Calicut; and,
in Goa, the virgins are proſtituted by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
either voluntarily, or from choice, to an
idol of iron. Groſs ſuperſtition makes theſe
people commit ſuch abominable outrages, from
religious motives. But views more ſervile and
intereſted have induced men of other countries to
devote their daughters to their chiefs. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Canary iſles, and of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Congo, proſtitute, in this manner, their
daughters, without any injury to their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Nearly the ſame cuſtom takes place in
Turkey, Perſia, and ſeveral other countries both
of Aſia and Africa. Their moſt eminent nobles
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0195400702:435"/>
think themſelves highly honoured to receive
from their ſovereign women with whom he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is already diſguſted.</p>
               <p>In the kingdom of Arracan, and in the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
iſlands, a man would eſteem it to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful
to marry a young woman who had not
been previouſly deflowered; and nothing but
the force of money can prevail on any perſon to
precede the huſband. In the province of Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,
mothers anxiouſly ſearch for ſtrangers, and
earneſtly ſollicit them to put their daughters in
a proper ſtate for obtaining huſbands. The
Laplanders likewiſe prefer girls who have had
commerce with ſtrangers. They fancy them to
poſſeſs uncommon merit, becauſe they have been
able to pleaſe men who are better judges of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and female accompliſhments than themſelves.
In Madagaſcar, and ſeveral other countries, the
moſt diſſolute and debauched women are ſooneſt
married. Many other examples might be given
of this ſtrange taſte, which nothing but the
groſſeſt and moſt depraved manners could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
               <p>After puberty, marriage is the natural ſtate
of man. A man ought to have but one wife,
and a woman but one huſband. This is the
law of nature; for the number of females is
nearly equal to that of males. Such laws as
have been enacted in oppoſition to this natural
principle, have originated ſolely from tyranny
and ignorance. Reaſon, humanity, and juſtice
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0195400702:436"/>
revolt againſt thoſe odious ſeraglios, in which
the liberty and the affections of many women
are ſacrificed to the brutal paſſion of a ſingle
man. Does this unnatural pre-eminence render
theſe tyrants of the human race more happy?
No! Surrounded with eunuchs, and with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
uſeleſs to themſelves and to other men,
they are tormented with the conſtant appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that accumulated load of miſery they
have created.</p>
               <p>Marriage, therefore, as it is eſtabliſhed among
us, and other nations who are directed by the
lights of reaſon and revelation, is a ſtate moſt
conſonant to the nature of man, and in which
it is his duty to employ thoſe new faculties he
acquires from puberty. By obſtinately perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in celebacy, theſe powers become trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and ſometimes fatal. In either ſex, too
long continency may give riſe to diſeaſes, or
create irritations ſo violent, that neither reaſon
nor religion will be able to counteract the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity
of thoſe paſſions they excite: And
thus man may be reduced to a level with the
brutes, which, under the influence of ſuch ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
become perfectly furious and ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>In women, the furor uterinus is the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
effect of this irritation. This diſeaſe is a
ſpecies of madneſs, which deranges their ideas,
and deprives them of all ſenſe of ſhame. Both
the nature and the ſeat of this melancholy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0195400702:437"/>
are indicated by the moſt laſcivious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
and the moſt indelicate actions. I
have ſeen, with aſtoniſhment, a girl at the age
of twelve years, who had a brown, but lively
and florid complexion, and, though low in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
was ſtrong and plump, commit the moſt
indecent actions upon the very appearance of a
man, from which ſhe could not be deterred, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the preſence or chaſtiſement of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
She did not, however, loſe her reaſon;
and the paroxyſms of the diſeaſe ceaſed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhe was left with her own ſex. Ariſtotle
alledges, that, at this age, the irritation is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and that girls ought then to be carefully
watched. The remark may be applicable to the
climate in which he lived; but, in colder coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
the ardor of the female conſtitution does
not appear ſo early.</p>
               <p>When the furor uterinus increaſes to a certain
degree, marriage will not remove it; and there
have been inſtances of its proving fatal. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
the force of nature is ſeldom the only cauſe
of a paſſion ſo deteſtible, even when there is a
prediſpoſition to it in the habit of body. Before
it arrives at this extremity, the imagination muſt
be inflamed by licentious converſation, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene
repreſentations, or other cauſes. Among
women, the oppoſite temperament is infinitely
more common; for, with regard to this paſſion,
moſt of them are either cool or indifferent.
There are alſo many men to whom chaſtity is
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0195400702:438"/>
an eaſy virtue. I have known ſome men who,
at the age of twenty-five or thirty, enjoyed good
health, without having ever felt this paſſion ſo
ſtrong as to render any gratification neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Continency, however, is leſs to be dreaded
than exceſs. The number of immoderate men
is too great to require particular examples. By
exceſs, ſome have loſt their memory; ſome have
been deprived of ſight; ſome have become bald;
and many have periſhed by pure debility.
Young perſons can never be ſufficiently warned
of the irreparable injury to their health, which
the indulgence of the venereal appetite never
fails to produce. How many ceaſe to be men,
or, at leaſt, ceaſe to enjoy the powers of manhood,
before the age of thirty? and how many, at
fifteen or eighteen, receive the ſeeds of a diſeaſe,
diſgraceful in itſelf, and which it is often impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to eradicate?</p>
               <p>It has already been remarked, that, at the age
of puberty, the growth uſually ſtops. It fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
happens, however, that, even after pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
a tedious illneſs makes the body increaſe
in length more than it would have done in a
ſtate of perfect health. This extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
is probably occaſioned by the inactivity of
the external organs of generation during the
courſe of the diſeaſe. The organic particles do
not reach theſe parts, becauſe they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
thither by irritation; and this defect
of irritation is owing to a laſſitude and imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:0195400702:439"/>
of the parts, which prevent the ſecretion of
the ſeminal fluid. Theſe organic particles,
therefore, remain in the maſs of blood, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
extend the extremities of the bones,
nearly in the ſame manner as happens to eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.
Thus young people, after recovering
from a long ſickneſs, are often taller, but worſe
ſhaped, than formerly. Some, for inſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
hunch-backed, and others crook-legged;
becauſe the ſtill ductile extremities of the bones
have been unneceſſarily extended by a ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of organic particles, which, in a ſtate of
health, would have been exhauſted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of ſeminal fluid.</p>
               <p>The production of children is the chief inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of marriage. But this intention is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fruſtrated. Of the different cauſes of ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,
ſome are common to both ſexes. But, as
theſe cauſes are more apparent in men than in
women, they are, therefore, more commonly
aſcribed to the former. In both ſexes, ſterility
is occaſioned either by a defect in the original
conformation, or by accidental injuries done to
the organs themſelves. In men, the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
defects of conformation are thoſe which
affect the teſticles, or the muſcles called <hi>erectores
penis.</hi> A wrong direction of the urethra, which
is ſometimes not only oblique, but improperly
perforated, is another obſtacle to generation.
The adheſion of the prepuce to the fraenum is
another obſtacle; but it is not inſurmountable.
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0195400702:440"/>
In women, the conformation of the uterus may
likewiſe occaſion ſterility. If the orifice of the
uterus be always open, or always ſhut, concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be equally prevented. But the moſt
frequent cauſe of barrenneſs, both in men and
women, ariſes from ſome depravity in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
fluids. I formerly quoted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> remark of
Valiſnieri, that a corruption of the fluid in the
teſticles of women rendered them entirely bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.
It is the ſame with men. If the ſecretion
by which ſemen is formed be vitiated, the fluid
is unfit for impregnation. Theſe cauſes of ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility
are not diſcoverable by any external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.</p>
               <p>In caſes of ſterility, different means have been
employed to diſcover whether the defect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the man or the woman. Inſpection
is the firſt reſource; and, if the barrenneſs be
occaſioned by a fault in the external conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is ſufficient. But, if the defect lie in the
internal organs, it is hardly poſſible either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
or remove it. Some men, though they
appear to be perfectly formed, want the genuine
ſign of a proper conformation. Others have
this ſign ſo imperfectly, or ſo ſeldom, that it is
only a very equivocal mark of virility.</p>
               <p>Every body knows that the action of this part
is not under the command of the mind. It is
the moſt animal part of the human body; for
it acts by a kind of inſtinct, the cauſes of which
are unknown. How many young perſons, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0195400702:441"/>
in perfect purity, and totally ignorant
of pleaſure, have felt the moſt lively impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
without being able to recogniſe either their
cauſe, or their object? How many, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
remain cold and languid, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the efforts of ſenſe and imagination?</p>
               <p>This part of our bodies, therefore, belongs
leſs to us than any other of our members. It
acts or is languid without our participation.
Its functions commence or terminate at certain
periods. All this happens without our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and often contrary to our inclination.</p>
               <p>Where, then, is the foundation for thoſe laws,
which are ſo unjuſt in their principle, and ſo
diſgraceful in their execution? The rules and
decrees of the Congrés<note n="*" place="bottom">The name of an infamous court in France, where trials for impotency, with a view to diſſolve marriages, were held. Proofs by inſpection were taken before the judge, who was aſſiſted by ſurgeons and midwives. This court was aboliſhed by an arret of the parliament of Paris, dated 18th February 1677. It is ſurpriſing that the Count de Buffon, who expreſſes the utmoſt deteſtation againſt this court, ſhould have mentioned nothing of its diſſolution.</note> are an affront to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
reaſon. Its members ſhould have known,
that the very means they employed to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
truth, were not only indelicate, but infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
prevented its diſcovery.</p>
               <p>When there is no defect in the external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
barrenneſs proceeds oftener from
the woman than the man; for, independent of
the pernicious effects of the fluor albus, there
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0195400702:442"/>
ſeems to be another cauſe which has never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
attention.</p>
               <p>From my experiments, related in the ſixth
chapter, it appears that the teſticles of females
give birth to a kind of natural protuberances,
which I have called <hi>glandular bodies.</hi> They
grow in a gradual manner, and ſerve for ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and maturating the ſeminal fluid. They
are in a continual fluctuating ſtate. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to grow under the membrane of the teſticle,
which they ſoon perforate; they then ſwell,
and their extremities ſpontaneouſly open, and
diſtill a ſeminal fluid for ſome time; after which
they gradually decay, leaving only a ſmall red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
cicatrice on the place from whence they
ſprung. Theſe glandular bodies no ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear
than they are replaced by others; ſo that
the teſticles are continually labouring, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
conſiderable changes. Hence any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement
in theſe organs, either by an unuſual
thickneſs of the fluid, or weakneſs of the veſſels,
prevents the proper exerciſe of their functions,
renders them unable to ſecrete, or rather vitiates
and corrupts the ſeminal fluid, which neceſſarily
gives riſe to ſterility.</p>
               <p>Conception ſometimes precedes puberty. Many
women have become mothers before the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the menſes; and ſome, who never had
any ſymptoms of this evacuation, are in the
habit of bearing children. Inſtances of this
kind happen in our climate, without travelling
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0195400702:443"/>
for them to Brazil, where whole nations are
ſaid to be perpetuated, though not a ſingle wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
be ſubject to the menſtrual diſcharge; an
evident proof that it is not the menſtrual blood,
but the ſeminal fluid of the male and female,
which are eſſentially neceſſary to generation. It
is likewiſe known, that the ceſſation of the
menſes, which generally happens about the age
of forty or fifty years, does not diſqualify every
woman for conception; for ſome women have
become pregnant at ſixty or ſeventy, and even
at an age ſtill more advanced. Theſe examples,
though pretty frequent, may be regarded as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
to the general rule; but they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to demonſtrate that the menſtrual blood is
by no means eſſential to generation.</p>
               <p>In the ordinary courſe of Nature, women
conceive not before the menſes appear, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have ceaſed. The age at which men
firſt acquire the faculty of generating is not ſo
diſtinctly marked. His body muſt attain a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
growth before ſemen is ſecreted; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this fluid be fully maturated, the degree
of growth muſt be ſtill greater. This generally
happens between the twelfth and eighteenth
years. But the period when man loſes the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative
faculty, Nature ſeems to have left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined.
At ſixty or ſeventy, when old age
begins to enervate the body, the ſemen is leſs
abundant, and often unprolific. In the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of public ſocieties, however, there are
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:0195400702:444"/>
many inſtances of men who have continued to
procreate at the age of eighty and ninety.</p>
               <p>There are likewiſe examples of boys who
have propagated at eight, nine, and ten years,
and of girls who have conceived at ſeven, eight,
and nine years. But ſuch facts are exceedingly
rare, and ought to be regarded as ſingular phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.
The ſign of virility appears in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy:
But that is not ſufficient; the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſemen muſt be added; and this happens
not till the growth of the body be nearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.
At firſt the quantity is ſmall, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſterile.</p>
               <p>Two marks of conception have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by authors. The firſt is a kind of tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
or ſhivering, which is ſaid to begin at the
moment of conception, and continues for ſome
days. The ſecond is derived from the orifice
of the uterus, which, it is aſſerted, cloſes entirely
after conception. But theſe ſigns appear to be
very equivocal, if not altogether imaginary.</p>
               <p>This tremor is mentioned by Hippocrates in
the following terms: 'Liquido conſtat harum
rerum peritis, quod mulier, ubi concepit, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
inhorreſcit ac dentibus ſtridet, et auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
reliquumque corpus convulſio prehendit.'
Galen, on the authority of ſome women, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
this ſymptom to a contraction of the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.
Others expreſs it by a vague ſenſation of
cold over the whole body, and employ the words
<hi>horror</hi> and <hi>horripilatio.</hi> Theſe, and other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:0195400702:445"/>
endeavour, like Galen, to eſtabliſh the
fact upon the teſtimony of women. Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
ſays, 'quae in utero gerunt, harum os uteri
clauſum eſt;' or, according to another tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
'quaecunque ſunt gravidae, illis os uteri
connivet.' Opinions, however, are various as
to the changes which the uterus undergoes after
conception. Some maintain, that the edges of
the <hi>os tincae</hi> are drawn ſo cloſe together, that no
vacuity is left between them; and others affirm,
that theſe edges are not exactly cloſe till after
the two firſt months of pregnancy. They agree,
however, that, immediately after conception, the
orifice is ſhut up by a glutinous humour; that
the os tincae, which, previous to conception,
might admit a ſubſtance of the ſize of a pea,
has no perceptible aperture; and that this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is ſo evident, as to be diſtinguiſhable by
a ſkilful midwife. If theſe aſſertions were
founded in truth, the ſtate of pregnancy might
be known a few days after conception.</p>
               <p>It is urged, on the other hand, that if, after
conception, the orifice of the uterus were cloſed,
ſuperfoctation would be impoſſible. To this it
may be replied, that the ſeminal liquor may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
penetrate through the membranes of the
uterus; that the uterus itſelf may open to
receive the materials neceſſary for ſuperfoeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that, at any rate, ſuperfoetations ſo
ſeldom happen, that they make a very trifling
exception to the general rule. Other authors
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0195400702:446"/>
maintain, that this change in the uterus can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
appear but in women who have formerly
conceived and brought forth children. In firſt
conceptions, indeed, the difference muſt be leſs
perceptible; but, though ever ſo conſpicuous,
we have not ſufficient evidence to conclude, that
it is a certain, a uniform, and a poſitive ſign. The
ſtudy of anatomy, aided by experience, affords,
on this ſubject, general notions only, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
upon a cloſer examination. The ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
may be applied to the ſhivering, or
convulſive cold, which ſome women are ſaid to
feel at the time of conception. As moſt women
experience not this ſenſation; as others, on the
contrary, aſſure us, that they have felt a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heat; and as others ſtill confeſs that they are
utter ſtrangers to all ſuch feelings; the natural
concluſion is, that all theſe marks are highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal,
and that, when they do happen, they
ought to be conſidered, not as the effects of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
but of other cauſes.</p>
               <p>On this ſubject I ſhall add one fact from Mr
Parſons's lectures on muſcular motion, p. 79.
which proves, that the orifice of the uterus does
not cloſe immediately after conception, or, if
it does cloſe, that the ſemen may find a paſſage
into the uterus, by penetrating through its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
In the year 1714, a woman of Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtown
in South Carolina, was delivered of two
children, the one immediately after the other.
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:0195400702:447"/>
To the aſtoniſhment of the aſſiſtants, the one
child was black and the other white. This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
teſtimony of the woman's infidelity to her
huſband, obliged her to acknowledge, that, one
morning, her huſband having juſt left her bed, a
negro entered her chamber, and, by threats of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
death, compelled her to gratify his deſires.
This fact ſhows, that the conception of two or
more children does not always happen at one
time, and ſupports my opinion, that the ſemen
penetrates through the texture of the uterus.</p>
               <p>There are many other equivocal ſigns of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
by which it is ſaid to be early diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable;
as a ſlight pain in the region of the
uterus and loins; a numbneſs over the whole
body; a continual drowſineſs; a melancholy
and capricious diſpoſition; the toothache, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache;
and a vertigo, which obſcures the ſight;
yellowiſh, blood-ſhot eyes, with contracted pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils
and depreſſed eye-lids; a pale and ſpotted
countenance; a depraved appetite, accompanied
with vomiting and ſpitting; hyſteric ſymptoms;
the fluor albus; the ſtoppage of the menſtrual
diſcharge, or, inſtead of it, an haemorrhage; the
ſecretion of milk in the breaſts, &amp;c. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
marks ſuppoſed to be peculiar to pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
might be added; but they are frequently
nothing more than the effects of particular
diſeaſes. But we ſhall leave the diſcuſſion of
theſe to phyſicians; details of this kind, to be
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0195400702:448"/>
uſeful, would require a long ſeries of profound
inveſtigation. This ſubject, like many others in
phyſiology, the animal oeconomy, and different
branches of the medical art, has ſeldom been
treated with any degree of philoſophical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy.</p>

               <p>AT the age of puberty, or a few years after
it, the human body attains its full ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The growth of ſome perſons ſtops at the
fourteenth or fifteenth year; and, in others, it
continues till they arrive at twenty-two or
twenty-three years. During this period, moſt
men are of a ſlender make: Their thighs and
legs are ſmall, and the muſcular parts are not
properly filled up. But, by degrees, the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
ſwell, the limbs and different parts of the
body aſſume their proper figure and proportions,
and, before the age of thirty, the body, in men,
acquires its moſt perfect ſymmetry.</p>
               <p>But, in women, the body ſooner attains this
ſymmetry. As their ſize is ſmaller, and their
muſcles, and other parts, leſs ſtrong, compact,
and ſolid, than thoſe of men, they arrive more
early at a ſtate of maturity. A woman at twenty
years is as perfectly formed as a man at thirty.</p>
               <p>The body of a well-ſhaped man ought to be
ſquare, the muſcles boldly marked, and the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the face diſtinctly defined. In women,
the parts are rounder and ſofter, and their features
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0195400702:450"/>
are more delicate. Man is adorned with ſtrength
and majeſty; grace and ſoftneſs are the peculiar
embelliſhments of woman.</p>
               <p>Even the external figure of the human ſpecies
declares them to be the ſovereigns of the earth.
The body of man is erect; his attitude is that
of command; and his countenance, which is
turned towards the heavens, is impreſſed with
the ſignatures of ſuperior dignity. The image
of his ſoul is painted in his face; the excellence
of his nature penetrates through his material
form, and animates his features with a divine
illumination. His majeſtic deportment, and the
firmneſs of his movements, announce the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
of his rank. He touches the earth but
with his extremity: He views it only at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and ſeems to deſpiſe it. His arms are
not pillars to ſupport his body: His hands tread
not the earth, and loſe not, by friction and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that delicacy of feeling for which they
were originally deſtined. His arms and hands
are formed for purpoſes more noble, namely,
for executing the commands of his intellect, for
laying hold of diſtant objects, for removing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles,
for defending him from injuries, and for
ſeizing and retaining objects of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>When the mind is at eaſe, all the features of
the countenance are in a ſtate of profound tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.
Their proportion, their harmony, their
union, point out ſerenity of ſentiment, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
with the calm that ſubſiſts within. When
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:0195400702:451"/>
the ſoul, however, is agitated, the human viſage
becomes a living canvas, upon which paſſions are
repreſented with equal energy and delicacy;
where every emotion is expreſſed by a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
feature; where every impreſſion anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates
the will, and reveals, by obvious and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic
characters, thoſe intentions and feelings
which we are ſollicitous to conceal.</p>
               <p>It is in the eyes that the paſſions are moſt
ſtrongly marked, and moſt readily diſcovered.
The eye belongs to the ſoul more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bodily organ. It participates of every
mental emotion, the ſofteſt and moſt tender,
as well as the moſt violent and tumultuous.
It exhibits theſe emotions in all their force and
purity, and infuſes into the ſoul of the ſpectator
the fire and the agitation of that mind in which
they originate. In fine, the eye reflects the
light of thought, and the glow of ſentiment;
it is the ſenſe of the underſtanding, and the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of intelligence.</p>
               <p>Men who ſquint, or are ſhort-ſighted, have
leſs of this external ſoul, (as it may be termed),
whoſe chief reſidence is in the eye. Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
hurt the phyſiognomy, and give to the fineſt
countenance a diſagreeable, and often a ſtupid
air. As nothing but ſtrong and violent paſſions
are diſcoverable in viſages of this kind, and as
they exhibit no marks of delicacy or vivacity of
ſentiment, we are apt to form unfavourable
impreſſions of ſuch perſons, which, however
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0195400702:452"/>
ill-founded, it is difficult for us to efface. We
are ſo accuſtomed to be influenced by external
appearances, that, if no ſymptoms of thought
and reflection appear in a man's countenance,
we inſtantly decide him to be void of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We even draw concluſions from the cut
of the cloaths, or a curl of the periwig; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are theſe concluſions always falſe. Men
ought, therefore, to pay ſome attention to theſe
minute articles; becauſe, in the eye of ſtrangers,
they make a part of ourſelves, and contribute
not a little to the judgments they form of our
underſtanding and breeding.</p>
               <p>A vivacious or a languid motion of the eye
has a prodigious effect on the character of the
countenance. Eyes are of different colours, dark
hazel, light hazel, green, blue, gray, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
gray. The iris has a ſmooth velvet-like
appearance, and conſiſts of many ſmall filaments,
regularly diſpoſed, and directed towards the
centre of the pupil. The moſt uſual colours of
the eye are the hazel and the blue; and both
theſe colours are ſometimes to be found in the
ſame eye. The eyes commonly called black,
when narrowly inſpected, are only of a dark
hazel colour. They appear black in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of their being contraſted with the white
of the eye. Thoſe of a leſs deep hazel are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
reckoned black, but are not equally beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Shades of orange, hazel, gray, and blue
are frequently to be met with in the ſame eye;
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:0195400702:453"/>
but, wherever there is a blue tint, it becomes the
prevailing colour, and outſhines all the reſt.
The black and the blue are the moſt beautiful
colours, and give moſt fire and vivacity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
to the eye. In black eyes, there is
more force and impetuoſity; but the blue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
in ſweetneſs and delicacy. The former
dart forth a perpetual and uniform flame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their colour appears always the ſame, and
reflects the ſame rays: But the modifications of
light are diſtinguiſhable in the blue; becauſe
different rays are reflected by the various tints
of which they are compoſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and other varieties in the colours of the
eyes, are peculiar to man, the horſe, &amp;c. In
moſt other animals, the colours of individuals
vary not. The eyes of the ox are brown; thoſe
of the ſheep are of a watry colour; thoſe of the
goat are gray, &amp;c. Ariſtotle alledges, that, among
men, gray eyes are the ſtrongeſt; that the blue
are weaker; that prominent eyes are ſhort-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that brown eyes ſee not ſo well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in a faint light.</p>
               <p>Though the eye, in moving, ſeems to be
drawn towards either ſide, yet it only moves
round its own centre, which gives the pupil
the appearance of approaching or receding from
the angles of the orbit, and of being elevated or
depreſſed. In man the eyes are nearer each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in any other animal. In ſome ſpecies,
the eyes are ſo remotely ſituated, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:0195400702:454"/>
for both eyes to ſee the ſame object at
the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Next to the eyes, the parts which give moſt
character to the countenance are the eye-brows.
Being totally different from every other feature,
their effect is augmented by the contraſt: They
form a deep ſhade in the canvas, and give relief
to the other colours and features. The laſhes of
the eye-lid have alſo their effect; when long
and buſhy, they beſtow beauty on the eye, and
give a mild and pleaſant aſpect to the face.
Laſhes on both eye-lids are peculiar to man and
the ape. Other animals have hair on the upper
lid only; and, even in man, the laſh of the under
lid is leſs than that of the upper. The eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows
have only two movements; one by which
they are elevated; and the other by which they
are depreſſed and contracted.</p>
               <p>The eye-lids guard the ball of the eye from
duſt, inſects, &amp;c. and keep the cornea moiſt.
The upper eye-lid moves up and down; but
the under lid has little or no motion. Although
the motion of the eye-lids be ſubject to the will,
yet, by ſleep, fatigue, or ſurpriſe, we loſe the
command of them. They are ſometimes alſo
affected with convulſive motions, which we are
unable to reſtrain. In birds, and amphibious
quadrupeds, the under eye-lid alone moves;
and fiſhes and inſects have no eye-lids either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
or below.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:0195400702:455"/>
The fore-head occupies a large part of the
ſace, and contributes greatly to its beauty. It
ſhould be well proportioned, neither too flat nor
too prominent; neither too narrow, nor too
ſhort; and it ſhould be regularly adorned with
hair both above and on each ſide. The hair
gives great expreſſion to the countenance; bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is therefore a capital defect; and the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of employing artificial hair, which is now ſo
general, ought to be confined to ſuch as are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
bald; for borrowed locks often change
the true character of the face. If every man
wore his own hair, and allowed it to float free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it would be more eaſy to diſtinguiſh cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
by the general aſpect of the countenance.
The crown of the head, and immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the temples, are the parts which firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
bald; but the hair below the temples, and
on the under part of the back of the head, ſeldom
falls off. Baldneſs is peculiar to man: Women,
in the moſt advanced age, though their hair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
white, are ſeldom affected with it: Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and eunuchs are not more ſubject to bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than women; and the hair is ſtronger and
more abundant in youth than at any other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.
The longeſt hair becomes dry, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
waſtes and falls off as we advance in life.
The whiteneſs commences at the points; and
when the hair is totally white, it loſes its
ſtrength, and at laſt falls off altogether. There
have been examples of young people whoſe hair
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:0195400702:456"/>
was rendered white by diſeaſe, and which reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
its natural colour after their health was
reſtored. It is alledged by Ariſtotle, that no
man becomes bald before having intercourſe
with women, excepting ſuch as have been bald
from their birth. The antient writers upbraid
the inhabitants of the iſlands of the Archipelago
with the epithet <hi>bald-heads</hi>; and aſſert, that theſe
iſlanders are all brought into the world with this
defect<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dapper's, Voyage, p. 354. and Plin. edit. Hardouin, p. 541.</note>.</p>
               <p>The noſe is the moſt prominent feature in the
face. But, as it has very little motion, even in
the moſt violent paſſions, it contributes more to
the beauty than to the expreſſion of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
and, unleſs it be deformed, or greatly
diſproportioned, it is leſs attended to than thoſe
features which are capable of motion, as the
mouth and the eyes. The form of the noſe, and
its remarkable prominency, are peculiar to the
human ſpecies. Moſt animals have noſtrils ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
by a partition; but none of them have
an elevated and advanced noſe. Even the apes
may be ſaid to have only noſtrils; the noſe of
an ape has the ſame poſition as that of a man;
but it is ſo ſhort and flat, that it can hardly be
regarded as ſimilar. By this organ, men, and
moſt animals, breathe, and ſmell odoriferous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Birds have no cartilaginous noſtrils; they
have only two holes or pipes for the purpoſes of
reſpiration and ſmelling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:0195400702:457"/>
Next to the eyes, the mouth and lips have
both the greateſt motion and expreſſion. Theſe
motions are excited by the paſſions, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
forms of the mouth mark their different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
and modifications. The organs of ſpeech
give the mouth an animation ſuperior to every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the face. The vermilion of the lips,
and the whiteneſs of the teeth, ſo much excel
the other colours of the face, that they attract
our chief regard. We fix our eyes on the mouth
of the ſpeaker; every word, every articulation,
produces different motions in the lips; and, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
rapid, it is eaſy to diſtinguiſh them from
each other. The deaf learn to diſtinguiſh theſe
motions ſo accurately, that they often know the
ſentiments of the ſpeaker merely by attending
to the motions of his lips.</p>
               <p>In man, and in all other animals, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaw
alone is endowed with the power of motion.
The crocodile, the opinion of Ariſtotle and many
other naturaliſts notwithſtanding, is not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception:
I have examined many ſkeletons of
that animal, and have found, by the nature of
the articulation, that the under-jaw alone was
moveable. In the human foetus, and in
monkeys, the under-jaw is greatly advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the upper. The deformity, in adults, is
equal, whether the under-jaw be too prominent,
or too much depreſſed: It ought to be nearly
on a level with the upper. Strong paſſions, as
well as languor, often produce an involuntary
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:0195400702:458"/>
motion in the under-jaw: Pain and pleaſure, as
well as languor, give riſe to yawning; but, in
the former, the motion is more briſk and lively.</p>
               <p>When the mind is ſuddenly affected with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
deſire, or keen regret, we feel a ſort of
ſtarting, or internal oppreſſion; this motion of
the diaphragm elevates the lungs, and produces
that ſudden inſpiration which forms a ſigh:
And, when the mind conſiders the cauſe of its
emotion, and perceives no method of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing
its deſire, or of baniſhing its regret, the
ſighs are repeated, and ſorrow, or mental pain,
ſucceeds. If this pain of mind be great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected,
it produces tears; the air ruſhes quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the lungs, and gives riſe to many inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which are accompanied with involuntary
ſhocks: Each inſpiration makes a noiſe ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than that of ſighing, and is diſtinguiſhed
by the name of ſobbing; theſe ſobs ſucceed each
other more rapidly than ſighs; and, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
the ſound of the voice is more apparent.
The accent of the voice is ſtill more diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in groaning, which is a ſpecies of ſob
long continued: and its ſlow ſound is heard both
in expiration and inſpiration: Its expreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in the continuation of a plaintiff tone form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by inarticulate ſounds. Groans are ſhorter
or longer according to the degree of ſorrow or
dejection; but they are generally repeated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times. The time of inſpiration forms the
interval that takes place between each groan;
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:0195400702:459"/>
and the intervals are nearly equal both in their
duration and their diſtance. The plaintiff ſhriek
is a groan expreſſed with force, and with a high
tone of voice. The ſhriek, when very ſharp,
generally continues on the ſame tone through
its whole extent; but, when moderate, it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ends in a lower tone.</p>
               <p>Laughter is an interrupted ſound, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
and accompanied with a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive
motion of the belly, which is alternately
elevated and depreſſed. To facilitate this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the breaſt and head are ſometimes thrown
forward; the cheſt remains immoveable; the
angles of the mouth recede from each other;
and the cheeks ſwell: Every time that the belly
is depreſſed, the air burſts from the mouth, and
occaſions a noiſe, which, during the fit, is often
repeated, ſometimes on the ſame tone, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the tones gradually diminiſh.</p>
               <p>The lips, in immoderate laughter, and in moſt
violent paſſions, open wide; but, in the more
tranquil emotions, the angles of the mouth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede,
without any opening of the lips, the
cheeks ſwell, and, in ſome perſons, dimples are
formed in them near the corners of the mouth:
This charm belongs to the graces, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
attended with an agreeable ſmile, which
is a mark of benevolence, and of internal ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
A ſmile is alſo a mode of expreſſing
contempt and ridicule; but, in theſe malignant
ſmiles, we preſs the lips cloſe to each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:0195400702:460"/>
The cheeks are uniform features, and have
little motion or expreſſion, excepting from that
involuntary redneſs or paleneſs with which they
are covered in different paſſions; they unite
the features, and give a contour to the face; they
contribute more to beauty than to expreſſion;
and the ſame obſervation may be applied to the
chin, the ears, and the temples.</p>
               <p>Shame, anger, pride, joy, equally give riſe to
bluſhing; while fear, terror, and ſorrow, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a paleneſs in the face. This change of
colour is involuntary; it exhibits the ſtate of
the mind without its conſent. It is an effect of
ſentiment over which the will has no command.
We can eaſily diſguiſe the other marks of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
for a moment's reflection enables us to
ſtop the action of the muſcles of the face which
characteriſe particular paſſions, and even to
change their direction; but to ſtop or alter the
redneſs or paleneſs of the countenance, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our power; becauſe theſe depend on a
peculiar motion of the blood, occaſioned by the
action of the diaphragm, which is the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
organ of ſenſation.</p>
               <p>In different paſſions, the whole head is affected
with different motions and poſitions: It hangs
forward during ſhame, humility, and ſorrow;
it inclines to one ſide in languor and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
it is elevated in pride, erect and fixed in
obſtinacy and ſelf-conceit; it is thrown back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in aſtoniſhment or ſurpriſe; and rolls from
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:0195400702:461"/>
ſide to ſide in contempt, ridicule, and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Grief, joy, love, ſhame, and compaſſion,
make the eyes ſwell, and cauſe the tears to
flow. The effuſion of tears is always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a contraction of the muſcles of the
face, which opens the mouth; the tears flow
through the lachrymal ducts into the noſe, and
increaſe the fluid with which it is naturally
moiſtened: The flowing of the tears is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;
they ſeem to burſt out at irregular inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</p>
               <p>In grief, the corners of the mouth are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
the under-lip riſes, the eye-lids fall
down, the pupil is elevated, and half concealed
under the eye-lid: The other muſcles of the
face are relaxed, which enlarges the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the mouth and the eyes; and, of courſe,
the countenance appears to be ſtretched out
beyond its ordinary length. (See plate VIII.
fig. 1.).</p>
               <p>In conſternation and terror, the brow is wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the eye-brows are elevated, the upper eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
opens ſo wide that it riſes above the pupil,
and uncovers a part of the white above the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil,
which laſt falls down, and is partly concealed
by the under-lid. The mouth, at the ſame
time, opens wide, the lips recede from each
other, and expoſe the teeth both above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
(See plate VIII. fig. 2.).</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:0195400702:462"/>
In contempt and deriſion, one corner of the
upper-lip riſes, and leaves the teeth bare; the
other corner moves a little, and has the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a malignant ſmile; the noſtril next the
elevated ſide of the lip ſhrivels up, and the angle
of the mouth falls down. The eye, on the ſame
ſide, is almoſt ſhut, while the other remains o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen;
and both pupils are depreſſed in the ſame
manner as when a perſon looks down from a
height. (See plate VIII. fig. 3.)</p>
               <p>In jealouſy, envy, and malice, the eye-brows
fall down and are wrinkled; the eye-lids riſe,
and the pupils fall down; the upper lip is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
on both ſides; the angles of the mouth
ſink a little, and the middle of the under-lip
riſes and joins the middle of the upper one.
(See plate VIII. fig. 4.)</p>
               <p>In laughing, the angles of the mouth are
drawn back, and ſomewhat elevated; the upper
part of the cheeks riſe; the eyes are more or
leſs ſhut; the upper lip riſes and the under one
ſinks; the mouth opens; and, when the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is immoderate, the ſkin of the noſe wrinkles.
(See plate VIII. fig. 5.)</p>
               <p>Beſide theſe marks, the arms, the hands, and
the whole body contribute to the expreſſion of
the paſſions. Geſture alſo concurs with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the features in expreſſing the different
emotions of the ſoul. In joy, for example, the
eyes, the head, the arms, and whole body, are
agitated with quick and various movements. In
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0195400702:463"/>
languor and grief, the eyes are ſunk, the head
reclines, the arms hang down, and the whole
body remains fixed and immoveable. In admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
ſurpriſe, and aſtoniſhment, every motion
is ſuſpended, and the perſon remains in the ſame
uniform attitude. Theſe expreſſions of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are involuntary: But there is another ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of expreſſion, which conſiſts in an agitation
of the eyes, head, arms, and body; and theſe
motions ſeem, at the ſame time, to be the effect
of reflection, and to depend on the will. They
appear to be efforts of the mind to defend the
body, and may be regarded as ſecondary ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
by which particular paſſions may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.
In love, hope, and keen deſire, we
elevate the head, and turn towards heaven, as if
imploring poſſeſſion; we ſtretch forward the
head to make a nearer approach; and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the arms and open the hands, in order to
ſeize and embrace the beloved object. On the
other hand, in fear, hatred, and horror, we puſh
the arms forward with precipitation, to repel the
object of our averſion; we turn back the head
and the eyes; we recoil, and at laſt fly, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to avoid it. Theſe motions are ſo ſudden,
that they appear to be involuntary: But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is the effect of habit; for theſe motions
are produced by reflection, and, by their alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
diſcover the perfection of thoſe qualities of
the body which enable it to obey, with ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
promptitude, the commands of the mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:0195400702:464"/>
As the paſſions are agitations or movements
of the mind, for the moſt part connected with
impreſſions of ſenſation, they may be expreſſed
by motions of the body, and particularly by thoſe
of the countenance. We can, therefore, form a
judgment of the affections of the mind by the
motions of the body, and can diſcover the real
ſituation of the ſoul by examining the changes
in the features of the face. But, as the mind
has no figure which can have any relation to
that of matter, we can form no judgment of the
general diſpoſition of any mind by the features
of the countenance, or by the figure of the body
with which it is connected. A deformed body
may contain an amiable mind; neither ſhould
we pronounce concerning the natural diſpoſition
of any perſon, merely becauſe the features of
his countenance are not agreeable; for there is
no analogy between features and the nature of
the ſoul, upon which any reaſonable conjectures
can be founded.</p>
               <p>The antients, however, were much addicted
to this falſe notion; and there have not been
wanting, in every age, men who wiſhed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a ſcientific divination derived from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſkill in phyſiognomy. But nothing is
more evident, than that this ſpecies of divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be extended no farther than to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the mind, when expreſſed by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the eyes, viſage, and other parts of the
body: The form of the noſe, of the mouth,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:0195400702:465"/>
and of other features, has no more connection
with the natural diſpoſition of any perſon, than
the ſtature, or ſize of the limbs, with the faculty
of thinking. Has a man more genius in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as his noſe is well made? Is the ability
of another more circumſcribed, becauſe his eyes
are ſmall and his mouth large? If muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be acknowledged, that the divination of
phyſiognomiſts is altogether chimerical, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of any foundation in nature.</p>
               <p>The ears, of all the parts of the head, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
leaſt to the expreſſion of the face. They
are placed at a ſide, and commonly concealed
under the hair. But, in quadrupeds, the ears
are more apparent; and by them we can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
whether the creatures be in a ſtate of vigour
or of imbecillity; their motions denote ſentiment,
and correſpond to the internal feelings of the
animal. The human ears, though furniſhed
with muſcles, have hardly any motion, either
voluntary or involuntary. Small ears are ſaid
to be moſt beautiful; but large ones are better
calculated for hearing. Some nations greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the lobes of their ears, by piercing them, and
placing in them pieces of wood or metal, which
they change ſucceſſively for others of greater
dimenſions, till the holes become enormous;
and the lobes uniformly increaſe in proportion
to the ſize of the holes. I have ſeen theſe round
pieces of wood, which had been brought from
India or South America, of more than an inch
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:0195400702:466"/>
and a half in diameter. It is difficult to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the origin of this ſingular cuſtom; but it
is equally difficult to trace the origin of piercing
the ears, (a practice almoſt general), and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the noſtrils, in order to adorn them with
rings, &amp;c. unleſs we attribute it to thoſe naked
ſavages, who contrived to carry, in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious
manner, ſuch things as appeared to
them to be moſt precious.</p>
               <p>But the whimſical varieties in the cuſtoms of
different nations are ſtill more apparent in the
manner of dreſſing and wearing their beards.
The Turks ſhave their heads; but allow their
beards to grow. Moſt Europeans, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
ſhave their beards, and wear their own or
borrowed hair. The ſavages of America pull
the hairs off their beards, but carefully preſerve
thoſe of the head. The Negroes ſhave their heads
in different figures; ſometimes they cut their hair
in the ſhape of little ſtars, ſometimes in the
manner of a friar, but moſt commonly in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſtripes. The Talapoins of Siam ſhave the
heads and eye-brows of thoſe children whoſe
education is entruſted to them. In this article
every nation has different uſages. Some prefer
the hair on the upper lip to that of the chin;
others eſteem hair on the cheek; ſome curl it,
and others wear it ſtraight. It is not long ſince
we woere our hair behind looſe and floating; we
now incloſe it in a bag. Our dreſs is different
from that of our fathers. The differences in
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:0195400702:467"/>
dreſs is as various as the different nations of the
globe: And, what is ſingular, we have adopted
that dreſs which is moſt incommodious, waſtes
moſt time in adjuſting, and is leaſt agreeable to
nature.</p>
               <p>Though faſhions ſeem to be founded on ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price
and fancy; yet, when generally adopted,
they merit examination. Men have always gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a value to thoſe things which excite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and which convey flattering ideas of riches,
power, and grandeur. The value of diamonds,
and other precious ſtones, ariſes from their
ſcarceneſs and brilliancy. The ſame obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
applies to thoſe ſhining metals, the weight
of which we regard ſo little, that, for the ſake
of ſinery, we ſpread them over our garments.
Ornaments of this kind are intended to excite
the attention of ſpectators, to give them an idea
of ſplendor and wealth, and to dazzle their
fancies: How few have the capacity of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
the perſon from the dreſs, or of eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
the man in any other manner than by
the metal on his cloaths?</p>
               <p>Every thing that is rare and brilliant will,
therefore, always be faſhionable, while men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
more eminence from riches than virtue,
and while the means of acquiring reſpect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſo widely different from real merit. Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
receive their firſt impreſſion of us from our
dreſs, which is varied according to the points of
view in which we wiſh to be conſidered. The
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:0195400702:468"/>
modeſt man, or he who wiſhes to aſſume that
character, dreſſes with a ſimplicity correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature of that virtue. The vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
on the contrary, neglect nothing that can
ſupport their pride or flatter their vanity; and
they diſtinguiſh themſelves by ſplendor or fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in their external appearance.</p>
               <p>Another very general object of dreſs, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the ſize of our figure, and to occupy more
room in the world than nature has allotted to us.
We wiſh to enlarge our dimenſions by high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeled
ſhoes and blown up garments; but, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
bulky our dreſs, it is exceeded by that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which it endeavours to cover. Why is the
doctor's head loaded with an enormous quantity
of borrowed hair, while that of the beau is ſo
thinly covered? The former wiſhes to have
the extent of his learning meaſured by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
dimenſions of his head; and the latter
deſires to diminiſh his head, that he may exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
the gaiety and ſprightlineſs of his genius.</p>
               <p>Other faſhions appear to have a more rational
object, namely, to conceal the defects of nature,
or to render them leſs diſagreeable. Taking
mankind in general, there is a greater number
of deformed bodies, and diſagreeable faces, than
of handſome figures, and beautiful countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Faſhions are always regulated by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the majority; and, as the greateſt
part of mankind have defects to conceal, it is
their intereſt to invent and ſupport thoſe modes
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:0195400702:469"/>
which tend to render their deformities leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.
Women never think of paint, till the
natural bloom of their cheeks is faded. Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
however, is a very general cuſtom. The
mode of whitening the hair<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſavages of New Guinea powder their heads and beards with chalk. See Recueil des Voyages, &amp;c. tom. 4. p. 637.</note> with powder, and
curling it, is not ſo univerſal; but it ſeems to
have been intended for the ſame purpoſe, to
make the colours and features of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
appear with greater advantage.</p>
               <p>But, leaving external ornaments, and the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
of the picture, let us return to the figure
itſelf. The head of man is differently conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
both internally and externally, from that of
any other animal. The head of the monkey
makes the neareſt approach; its brain, however,
is proportionally leſs; and there are other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
to be afterwards taken notice of. The
bodies of almoſt all quadrupeds are entirely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with hair. In man, the head alone has
this ornament before the age of puberty, and it
is more amply furniſhed with hair than the head
of any other animal. The monkey reſembles
man very much in his ears, noſe, and teeth.</p>
               <p>Among animals, there is a great diverſity in
the ſize, poſition, and number of their teeth.
Some are furniſhed with teeth in both jaws;
others have them only in the under-jaw; in
ſome they are widely ſeparated from each other;
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:0195400702:470"/>
and are cloſe and united in others. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of ſome fiſhes is a hard bony plate, ſtuck
full of ſharp points, which perform the office of
teeth.</p>
               <p>The mouths of moſt animals are armed with
ſome ſolid ſubſtance, which enables them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
or grind their food. The teeth of men,
quadrupeds, and fiſhes, the beaks of birds, the
pinchers, ſaws, &amp;c. of inſects, are all hard inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and, like the nails, horns, and hoofs,
derive their origin from the nerves. We for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
remarked, that nerves, when expoſed to
the air, acquire a ſurpriſing hardneſs. As the
mouth gives a free acceſs to the air, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
natural to think that the nerves which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
there ſhould harden, and produce the
teeth, the bony plate, the beak, the pinchers,
and all the other ſolid parts of animals.</p>
               <p>The neck ſupports the head, and unites it to
the body. It is larger and ſtronger in moſt
quadrupeds than in man. Fiſhes, and other
animals which are not furniſhed with lungs ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to ours, have no neck. Birds, in general,
have longer necks than other animals. Thoſe
birds which have ſhort claws have likewiſe ſhort
necks, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi> Ariſtotle ſays, that birds
of prey, which have pounces, are all ſhort necked.</p>
               <p>The human breaſt is proportionally larger
than that of other animals; and none but man
and the monkey have collar-bones. The
breaſts of women are larger and more promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:0195400702:471"/>
than thoſe of men: But their conſiſtence
and ſtructure are nearly the ſame; for the
breaſts of men can ſecrete milk. There are
many examples of this fact; and it commonly
happens at the age of puberty. I have ſeen a
young man of fifteen years ſqueeze more than a
ſpoonful of milk out of one breaſt. Among
animals there is a great variety in the number
and ſituation of their paps. Some, as the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key
and elephant, have only two placed on the
fore part of the breaſt; others have four, as the
bear; others, as the ſheep, have only two ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
between the hinder legs; others have them
in great numbers upon the belly, as the bitch
and the ſow. Birds, and all the oviparous
animals, have no paps. Viviparous fiſhes,
as the whale, the dolphin, &amp;c. have breaſts,
and ſuckle their young. The form of the
breaſts varies in different animals, and even
in the ſame animal at different ages. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that women whoſe breaſts are ſhaped
like a pear, make the beſt nurſes, becauſe the
mouth of the child comprehends not only the
nipple, but part of the breaſt itſelf.</p>
               <p>Below the breaſt is the belly, in which the
navel makes a conſpicuous figure. In other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
it is hardly perceptible; and even the
monkey has nothing but a kind of calloſity in
place of it.</p>
               <p>The arms of man have little reſemblance to
the fore feet of quadrupeds, and ſtill leſs to
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0195400702:472"/>
the wings of birds. The monkey tribe are the
only animals which have arms and hands; but
their ſtructure is more rude, and their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
leſs exact than thoſe of man; his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are likewiſe larger, and differently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
from thoſe of any other animal; and
it is on the top of the ſhoulders that he can bear
the heavieſt burdens.</p>
               <p>The form of the back differs not much from
that of ſome quadrupeds; the region of the
reins is indeed more muſcular and ſtrong. But
the buttocks are peculiar to the human body;
the thighs of quadrupeds are often miſtaken for
theſe parts, though they be totally different.
Man being the only animal who can ſupport
himſelf perfectly erect, the ſwelling, or cuſhion
on the top of his thighs, is neceſſary to ſuſtain
him in that poſture.</p>
               <p>The human foot is very different from that
of all other animals, the monkey not excepted.
The foot of the ape is rather a kind of hand;
its toes are long, and ſituated like fingers, the
middle one being by much the longeſt; and it has
no heel. The ſole of the foot is likewiſe lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in man, and his toes are better adapted for
preſerving the equilibrium of the body in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
running, dancing, and other movements.</p>
               <p>The human nails are leſs than thoſe of other
animals. If they protruded much beyond the
points of the fingers, they would obſtruct the
dexterity of the hand. Thoſe ſavages who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0195400702:473"/>
them to grow to an unnatural length, uſe
them for flaying and tearing animals. But, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their nails be ſtronger and longer than
ours, they can by no means be compared to the
hoofs or claws of other animals.</p>
               <p>With regard to the proportions of the human
body, we have no exact knowledge. The ſame
parts have not the ſame proportions in any two
individuals; and, even in the ſame perſon, the
correſponding parts are not perfectly ſimilar.
For example, the right arm or leg have ſeldom
the ſame dimenſions with the left. Repeated
obſervations alone can aſcertain a ſtandard by
which we may be enabled to form a perfect
idea of the natural and beſt proportions of the
human figure. It is not be comparing men, or
taking their dimenſions, that we are to expect
any light upon this ſubject: We have more
to hope from the art of deſigning, and the
efforts which have been made in imitating Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Taſte and ſentiment have exceeded the
limits of mechanical operations. The ſquare
and compaſs are laid aſide, and we truſt more
to the impreſſions made on the ſenſes. Every
poſſible form has been realized in bronze or in
marble. We recogniſe the ſtandard of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more by imitation of her, than by her own
productions; and we judge better concerning
the perfection of a ſtatue by viewing it, than
by taking its different dimenſions. It is by
long practice in the art of deſigning, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:0195400702:474"/>
of ſentiment, that eminent ſtatuaries have
been enabled to make men feel the juſtneſs of
proportion in the works of Nature. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
made ſtatues ſo exquiſitely fine, that they
have uniformly been regarded as exact repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of the moſt perfect human figures.
Theſe ſtatues, which were only copies of the
human form, are now conſidered as originals;
becauſe they were not imitated from an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,
but from the whole ſpecies ſo attentively
compared and diligently obſerved, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to find an equal degree of ſymmetry
and proportion in any one man that ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted.
We ſhall, therefore, relate the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the different parts which theſe artiſts
have fixed as ſtandards of perfection. They
commonly divide the height of the body into
ten times the length of the face; they likewiſe
divide each <hi>face,</hi> or tenth of the body, into three
equal parts; the firſt commences at the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the hair on the forehead, and terminates
at the root of the noſe; the noſe is the ſecond
diviſion; and the third extends from the noſe
to the end of the chin. In meaſuring the reſt
of the body, they uſe the term <hi>noſe,</hi> or length
of the noſe, to denote the third of a face, or the
thirtieth part of the body. The firſt face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at the root of the hair above the forehead,
and extends to the end of the chin; but, from
the top of the forehead to the crown, there is
ſtill a third of a face, or a noſe, in height. Thus,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:0195400702:475"/>
from the top of the head to the end of the chin,
there is a face and a third; from the chin to
the juncture of the clavicles, two thirds of a
face; and, therefore, from the top of the breaſt
to the crown of the head, is twice the length
of the face, or the fifth of the body; from the
joining of the clavicles to the under part of the
paps, they reckon one face; from this to the
navel is a fourth face; and the fifth extends
from the navel to the diviſion of the inferior
extremities, which ſhould complete half of the
length of the body. Two faces are exhauſted
between the thigh and knee, to the laſt of which
they allow half a face, being the firſt half of
the eight face; two faces are aſſigned between
the knee and top of the foot, and from that to
the ſole half a face, which completes the ten
faces, or length of the body. This diviſion has
been made from men of ordinary ſize; but, in
thoſe of a higher ſtature, they allow about half
a face additional between the paps and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
of the thighs, which, in tall men, is
not the middle of the body. When the arms
are fully ſtretched in a horizontal line, the ſpace
between the tops of the middle fingers is equal
to the length of the body. From the joining of
the collar-bone to the articulation of the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bone
with that of the arm, is one face.
When the arm hangs down, or is bended for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
it is four faces in length; two between
the joint of the ſhoulder and the elbow, and
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:0195400702:476"/>
two between the elbow and the root of the
little finger, in all five faces, and an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
for the other arm, which is preciſely the
length of the body; about half a face ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
for the length of the fingers; but it muſt
be remarked, that half a face is loſt in the joints
of the elbows and ſhoulders, when the arms are
extended. The hand is about a face in length, the
thumb a third of a face, or a noſe, and the longeſt
toe is of the ſame length with the thumb. The
under part of the foot is equal in length to the
ſixth part of the height of the body. For the
reaſons already mentioned, if an experiment be
made of theſe dimenſions upon any individual,
they will appear to be extremely imperfect. It
is ſtill more difficult to fix the proportional
thickneſs of the different parts of the body.
The changes are ſo great when the ſame man is
meagre, or in good caſe, and the action of the
muſcles in different poſitions, creates ſo much
variety in the dimenſions of the parts, that it is
almoſt impoſſible to give any determinate rules
upon this ſubject.</p>
               <p>The ſuperior parts of the body, in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
are larger than the inferior; the thighs and
legs are not nearly equal to half the length
of the whole body; as the child advances in
years, the inferior parts grow more in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than the ſuperior; and, when the growth
is complete, the thighs and legs are very nearly
one half of the length of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:0195400702:477"/>
The anterior part of the cheſt, in women, is
more elevated, and its diameter larger, than in
men; but the cheſts of the latter are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
broader. The haunches of women are
likewiſe larger than thoſe of men; becauſe the
haunch-bones of women, and thoſe which join
them and compoſe the pelvis, are proportionally
larger. Theſe differences in the ſtructure of the
cheſt and pelvis are ſo perceptible, that it is eaſy,
by this criterion, to diſtinguiſh the ſkeleton of a
woman from that of a man.</p>
               <p>There are great varieties in the length of men.
Thoſe are ſaid to be tall who are from five feet
eight inches to ſix feet high. The middle ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is from five feet five to five feet eight;
and thoſe who fall below theſe dimenſions are
ſaid to be of ſmall ſtature. Women, in general,
are two or three inches below the ſtandard of
men. Of giants and dwarfs, notice ſhall be
taken in another place.</p>
               <p>Though the human body be externally more
delicate, it is, however, very nervous, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſtronger, for its ſize, than the moſt robuſt
quadrupeds. In comparing the force of a lion
to that of a man, it ought to be conſidered, that
the lion is armed with teeth and talons; and that
theſe dreadful weapons convey a falſe idea of
real ſtrength. The arms which man has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from Nature are not offenſive; and happy
had it been, if art had never put into his
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:0195400702:478"/>
hands weapons more deſtructive than the claws
of the lion.</p>
               <p>But there is a juſter method of inſtituting a
compariſon between the ſtrength of a man and
that of the other animals, namely, by the weight
they are able to carry. It is affirmed, that the
porters of Conſtantinople can carry burdens of
nine hundred pounds weight; and Deſaguliers
tells us, that, by means of a certain harneſs, by
which every part of a man's body was propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
loaded, the perſon he employed in this
experiment was able to ſupport, in an erect po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
a weight not leſs than 2000 pounds. A
horſe, which is about ſix times the ſize of an
ordinary man, ought, therefore, when managed
in the ſame manner, to bear 12,000, or 14,000
pounds; an enormous weight, in compariſon of
what that animal can ſupport, even when it is
diſtributed with every poſſible advantage.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of animals may likewiſe be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by agility and perſeverance in labour.
Men accuſtomed to running, outſtrip horſes, or
at leaſt continue their ſpeed much longer; and
a man will accompliſh a long journey ſooner,
and be leſs fatigued, than even the beſt road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes.
The royal meſſengers of Iſpahan, who
are trained to running, go 36 leagues in 14 or
15 hours. We are aſſured by travellers, that
the Hottentots out-run lions in the chace; and
that thoſe ſavages who lie upon hunting, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
and even catch deer, and other animals of
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:0195400702:479"/>
equal ſwiftneſs. Many other ſtories are told of
the amazing nimbleneſs of ſavages, of the long
journies they accompliſh on foot, over the moſt
craggy mountains, where there is no path to
direct, and every obſtacle to obſtruct their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.
Theſe people are ſaid to travel 1000
leagues in ſix weeks, or at moſt two months. If
we except birds, whoſe muſcles are proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſtronger than thoſe of any other animal, no
other creature could ſupport ſuch long continued
fatigue. The civilized man is ignorant of his
own ſtrength; nor is he ſenſible how much he
is weakened by effeminacy, nor to what extent
he might recover his native force by an habitual
and vigorous exerciſe of his powers.</p>
               <p>Men of extraordinary ſtrength ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<note n="*" place="bottom">Nos quoque vidimus Athanatum nomine prodigioſue oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationis quingenario thorace plumbeo indutum, cothurniſque quingentorum pondo calcatum, per ſcenam ingredi. Plin. lib. 7.</note>. But this gift of Nature, which would
be highly valuable in the ſavage ſtate, is of little
uſe among poliſhed nations, where more depends
on mental than corporeal powers, and where
manual labour is confined to the inferior orders
of men.</p>
               <p>Men are much ſtronger than women; and
they have too often employed this ſuperiority in
exerciſing a cruel and tyrannical dominion over
the weaker ſex, who were entitled to ſhare with
them both the pleaſure and the pains of life.
Savage nations condemn the women to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:0195400702:480"/>
labour. They cultivate the ground, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
every office of drudgery, while the men
indolently recline in their hammocks, from
which they never think of ſtirring, unleſs when
they go a hunting or fiſhing; and ſo averſe are
they to motion, that they have often been known
to ſtand in the ſame poſition for ſeveral hours.
A ſavage has no idea of walking for amuſement;
and nothing aſtoniſhes him more than to ſee
Europeans walking backwards and forwards in
queſt of nothing. All men are naturally indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
but the ſavages of warm countries are not
only the moſt lazy of human beings, but the
moſt tyrannical to their women, whom they
treat with a cruel barbarity. In nations more
civilized, men dictate laws to the women. Theſe
laws are always more ſevere in proportion to
the groſſneſs of the national manners; and it is
only among people highly poliſhed that women
have obtained that equality of condition which
is due to them, and which contributes ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to the happineſs of ſociety. This polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of manners is the genuine offspring of the
ſofter ſex; they have oppoſed it to the arms of
the victor, while their modeſty has taught us to
acknowledge the empire of beauty, a natural ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
greatly ſuperior to mere ſtrength. But,
to give it full force and value, requires the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of art; for the ideas of beauty are ſo
different, ſo capricious, and even contradictory,
that the women, it is probable, have gained more
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:0195400702:481"/>
by the art of making themſelves amiable, than
by beauty itſelf, of which men form ſuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
judgments. Men are agreed as to the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
object of their paſſion for the other ſex,
the eſtimation of which is augmented by the
difficulty of obtaining it. The beauty of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
commenced the moment they learned to
make themſelves reſpectable, by refuſing all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to their hearts which proceeded not from
delicacy of ſentiment; and, whenever the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of ſentiment was felt, poliſhed manners was
a neceſſary conſequence.</p>
               <p>The taſte of beauty, among the antients, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
widely from ours. With them, a ſmall
fore-head and joined eye-brows were charming
features in a female countenance; and, in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
large joined eye-brows are ſtill highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed.
In ſome Indian countries, black teeth
and white hair are neceſſary ingredients in the
character of a beauty; and in the Marian-iſlands
it is a capital object with ladies to blacken
their teeth with herbs, and to bleach their hair
with certain liquors. Beauty, in China and
Japan, is compoſed of a large countenance,
ſmall and half concealed eyes, a broad noſe, little
feet, and a prominent belly. Some Indians of
America and of Aſia compreſs the heads of their
children between two wooden planks, with a
view to enlarge and beautify the face; others
compreſs them laterally, others depreſs the
crown only, and others make them as round as
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0195400702:482"/>
poſſible. Every nation has ideas of beauty pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to itſelf; and every individual has his own
notions and taſte concerning it. Theſe peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities
probably originate from the firſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
impreſſions we receive of certain objects;
and therefore depend more upon chance and
habit than upon difference of conſtitution. When
we come to treat of the ſenſes, we ſhall perhaps
be able to give more determined ideas concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe perceptions of beauty we receive by
the eye.</p>

               <p>When the body has acquired its full length,
it increaſes in thickneſs: The commencement
of this augmentation is the firſt ſtep towards

ſuperfluous matter, that blows up the body, and
loads it with a uſeleſs weight. This matter,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:0195400702:484"/>
which is denominated fat, generally appears at
the age of 35 or 40 years; and, in proportion
as the quantity of it augments, the body loſes
its former lightneſs and freedom of motion; its
generative faculty is diminiſhed; its members
turn unwieldy; and it acquires extenſion at the
expence of ſtrength and activity.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the bones increaſe in ſolidity; the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious
juices, which formerly ſerved to expand
the bones, now only increaſe their quantity of
matter, by filling up their internal cavities; the
membranes are changed into cartilages, and the
cartilages into bones; the fibres of the muſcles
grow rigid; the ſkin is deprived of its moiſture,
and wrinkles are gradually formed in it; the
hair turns hoary; the teeth fall out; the viſage
aſſumes a hagard appearance, the body bends
forward, &amp;c. The firſt approaches of this ſtate
are perceptible before the age of 40; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
by ſlow degrees till 60, and more rapidly
from that to 70, when decrepitude commences,
and continues to augment till 90 or 100, when
death puts a final period to our exiſtence.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now take a more particular ſurvey
of theſe changes; and, as we have inquired into
the cauſes of the growth and expanſion of the
human body, let us alſo inveſtigate thoſe of its
decay and diſſolution. At the commencement
of our exiſtence, the bones are only ſmall fibres,
of a ſoft and ductile ſubſtance, and gradually
acquire conſiſtence and ſolidity. They may be
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0195400702:485"/>
conſidered, in their original ſtate, as ſmall tubes
lined, both within and without, with a thin
membrane: This double membrane furniſhes
the oſſeous matter; for the ſmall interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the internal and external perioſteum is
ſoon converted into a bony plate. Some idea
of the production and growth of bones may be
formed, by comparing them with the manner
in which wood and the more ſolid parts of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
are produced. We ſhall take, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the fig-tree or the alder, which are at
firſt hollow in the middle, like the thigh and
other hollow bones of the body. When a bud,
that is to form a branch, begins to extend, it is
only a ſoft ductile matter, which, by extenſion,
becomes a ſlender herbaceous tube filled with
pith. The external and internal ſurfaces of
this tube are covered with a fibrous membrane,
as well as the internal partitions by which the
cavity is divided. Theſe membranes, however
thin, are compoſed of ſeveral plates of fibres
lying above each other, which are ſtill ſoft,
but gradually harden by depoſing the ſap
which they abſorb for their nouriſhment; and
by this means a woody plate is formed, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the firſt year, between the two membranes,
which is more or leſs thick in proportion to the
quantity of ſap that has been depoſited between
the external and internal membranes. But,
though each of theſe membranes become woody
internally, their external ſurfaces remain ſoft
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:0195400702:486"/>
and ductile; and, the following year, when the
bud at the top of the branch begins to expand,
the ſap riſes through the ſoft fibres of each
membrane, and converts them, by its ſediments,
into other woody plates. The ſame proceſs
goes on annually; and, in this manner, the tree
or branch gradually increaſes in thickneſs. The
internal cavity likewiſe augments in proportion
to the growth of the branch; becauſe the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
membrane extends along with the other
parts, and the woody plates are only applied
ſucceſſively to the plates already formed. If we
examine a branch, or ajoint, which has been the
product of one year, we ſhall find, that it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
preſerves the ſame figure through all the
ſtages of its growth. The joints or knots which
mark the production of each year, become fixed
points for the reaction of thoſe powers that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand
the contiguous parts during the following
year. The ſuperior buds react againſt theſe
points, and, by expanding themſelves, form new
branches or joints in the ſame manner as the firſt
were produced.</p>
               <p>The proceſs of oſſification would be very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
to that we have now deſcribed, if the fixed
points of the bones began at the extremities, in
place of the middle. At firſt the bones of the
foetus are only ſmall threads, or tubes, of a duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
matter, which are eaſily perceived through
the delicate and tranſparent ſkin. The thigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,
for example, is then a ſmall ſhort tube,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:0195400702:487"/>
like the herbaceous tubes above deſcribed. This
tube is ſhut at both ends by a pulpy ſubſtance,
and its external and internal ſurfaces are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with two membranes compoſed of ſeveral
layers of ſoft and ductile fibres. In proportion
as this tube receives nutritious juices, the two
extremities extend and recede from the middle
point, which always preſerves the ſame ſtation.
The extremities cannot extend without reacting
againſt this middle point; and the parts which are
neareſt it begin firſt to acquire ſolidity. The
firſt bony plate, like the firſt plate of wood, is
produced in the interval which ſeparates the
two membranes or perioſtea. But the oſſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
commences in the middle, and gradually
extends to the extremities, which remain ſoft
long after the middle parts are converted into
bone. The middle parts of bones, therefore,
being firſt oſſified, it is impoſſible that they
ſhould afterwards expand equally with thoſe
parts which remain longer in a ſoft and ductile
ſtate. This is the reaſon why bones are always
thinneſt in the middle, and thickeſt at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.
But, independent of this difference
between the longitudinal growth of bones and
of wood, the analogy between their increaſe in
thickneſs is very ſtriking: For the firſt bony
plate is produced from the internal part of the
perioſteum; and, after the formation of this
plate between the two perioſtea, two other plates
are ſoon formed, one on each ſide of the firſt,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:0195400702:488"/>
to which they adhere; and, by this means, both
the circumference of the bone, and the diameter
of its cavity, are augmented. Thus the interior
parts of the two perioſtea continue ſucceſſively
to produce bony plates, in the ſame manner as
woody plates are produced from the bark of
vegetables.</p>
               <p>But, after the bone has acquired its full
growth, after the perioſtea ceaſe to furniſh oſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
matter, then the nutritious juices, which
were formerly employed in augmenting the
bulk of the bone, ſerve only to increaſe its den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
Theſe juices depoſite themſelves in the
internal parts of the bones, and give them more
weight and ſolidity, as may eaſily be perceived
by comparing the weight and denſity of an ox
with thoſe of a calf. The ſubſtance of the bones
become, in proceſs of time, ſo compact, as not
to admit the circulation of thoſe juices which are
neceſſary for their ſupport and nouriſhment.
The ſubſtance of the bones, therefore, muſt now
undergo a change ſimilar to that which takes
place in old trees, after they have acquired their
full ſolidity; and this change is one of the firſt
cauſes which render the diſſolution of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
body inevitable.</p>
               <p>The cartilages, which may be regarded as ſoft
and imperfect bones, likewiſe receive nutritious
juices, which gradually augment their denſity.
They become more and more ſolid as we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
in years; and, in old age, they are almoſt
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:0195400702:489"/>
as hard as bones. This rigidity of the cartilages
renders the motion of the joints extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
and, at laſt, deprives us of the uſe of
our members, and produces a total ceſſation of
external movements. This is a ſecond, and
more marked cauſe of death, becauſe it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
itſelf by a laborious performance of the
common actions of the body.</p>
               <p>The membranes likewiſe become hard and
dry, as we advance in years. Thoſe, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
which ſurround the bones, ſoon loſe
their flexibility. At the age of 20, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of farther extenſion. The muſcular
fibres ſuffer a ſimilar change, in proportion to
the time of life; though, to the touch, they ſeem
to be ſofter as age increaſes. It is not the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
however, but the ſkin, that occaſions this
perception. After the body is come to its full
growth, the fat increaſes, and, by being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
between the fibres of the muſcles, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſkin and the muſcles themſelves,
makes them feel ſofter, when, in reality, their
denſity is greatly increaſed. Of this we have
an inconteſtible proof by comparing the fleſh of
young with that of old animals. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
it is tender and delicate; but, in the latter,
it is dry, hard, and unfit for eating.</p>
               <p>The ſkin always extends as the body increaſes;
but, when the body diminiſhes, the ſkin has not
elaſticity enough to enable it to contract to its
former dimenſions: It, therefore, continues in
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:0195400702:490"/>
wrinkles and folds, which can never be effaced.
The wrinkles of the face partly ariſe from this
cauſe; but, in their production, they have a
relation to the form, to the features, and to the
habitual motions of the countenance. If we
examine the face of a man of 25 or 30 years of
age, we may trace the origin of all the wrinkles
which will appear in old age, eſpecially when he
laughs, cries, or makes any violent grimace.
All the folds which are exhibited in theſe actions
will in time become indelible wrinkles.</p>
               <p>In proportion as we advance in years, the
bones, the cartilages, the membranes, the fleſh,
the ſkin, and every fibre of the body, become
more ſolid, hard, and dry. Every part ſhrinks
and contracts; and every movement is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſlowneſs and difficulty: The circulation
of the fluids is ſluggiſh and interrupted; perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is diminiſhed; the ſecretions change; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
becomes ſlow and laborious; the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
juices are leſs abundant, and, being rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by parts which are already too denſe, they
communicate no ſupplies. Theſe parts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
may be regarded as already dead, becauſe
they have ceaſed to receive nouriſhment. Thus
the body dies by inches; its motions gradually
decay; life wears away by imperceptible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
and death is only the laſt term in the
ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>As, in women, the bones, the cartilages, the
muſcles, and every other part of the body, are
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:0195400702:491"/>
ſofter and leſs ſolid than thoſe of men, they
muſt require more time in hardening to that
degree which occaſions death: Women, of
courſe, ought to live longer than men. This
reaſoning is confirmed by experience; for, by
conſulting the bills of mortality, it appears, that,
after women have paſſed a certain age, they live
much longer than men who have arrived at the
ſame age.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, it may alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that men who have a weakly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and approach nearer to the conſtitution of
women, ſhould live longer than thoſe who are
more robuſt; and likewiſe, that perſons of either
ſex, who are long before they arrive at their full
growth, ſhould outlive thoſe who advance more
rapidly to that point; becauſe, in this caſe, the
bones, cartilages, and fibres, are later in arriving
at that degree of ſolidity which is neceſſary to
their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>This natural cauſe of death is common to all
animals, and even to vegetables. An oak only
periſhes, becauſe the oldeſt parts of the wood,
which are in the centre, become ſo hard and
compact, that they can receive no farther nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.
The moiſture they contain being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of circulation, and not being replaced by
freſh ſap, ferments, corrupts, and gradually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the fibres of the wood into powder.</p>
               <p>The duration of life may, in ſome meaſure,
be computed by the time occupied in growth.
A plant or an animal that acquires maturity in
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:0195400702:492"/>
a ſhort time, periſhes much ſooner than thoſe
which are longer in arriving at that period. In
animals, as well as vegetables, the longitudinal
growth is firſt finiſhed. Man grows in ſtature
till he be 16 or 18 years of age; but his body
is not completely unfolded in thickneſs before
that of 30. Dogs acquire their full length in
leſs than one year; but their growth in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is not finiſhed till the ſecond year. A man,
who grows 30 years, lives till 90 or 100; and a
dog, whoſe growth terminates in two or three
years, lives only 10 or 12. The ſame obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be applied to moſt animals. Fiſhes
continue to grow for a great number of years;
they accordingly live for centuries; becauſe
their bones never acquire the denſity of thoſe of
other animals. When we give the particular
hiſtory of animals, we ſhall examine whether
there be any exception to this rule, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſeems to follow in proportioning the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of life to the time of growth, and whether
crows and ſtags live ſo long as is commonly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
But it may be laid down as a general
fact, that large animals live much longer than
ſmall animals, becauſe they require more time
to finiſh their growth.</p>
               <p>Thus the cauſes of our diſſolution are inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
and it is equally impoſſible to retard that
fatal period, as to change the eſtabliſhed laws of
Nature. The ideas of thoſe viſionaries, who
conceived the poſſibility of perpetuating human
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:0195400702:493"/>
life by the uſe of certain medicines, would
have periſhed with themſelves, if ſelf-love did
not always induce us to believe what exceeds
the powers of Nature, and to be ſceptical with
regard to the moſt certain and invariable truths.
The univerſal panacea, the transfuſion of the
blood, and other methods which have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to render our bodies immortal, are as chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
as the fountain of youth is fabulous.</p>
               <p>When the conſtitution is ſound, life may,
perhaps, be prolonged for a few years, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating
the paſſions, and by temperance. But
even this is a doubtful point; for, if it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that the body ſhould exert its whole force,
and that it ſhould waſte all its powers by labour
and exerciſe, what advantages can we derive
from regimen and abſtinence? Some men have
indeed exceeded the ordinary term of human
life: Without mentioning thoſe extraordinary
inſtances of longevity recorded in the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Tranſactions, ſuch as that of Par who
lived to the age of 144, and of Jenkins who
lived 165 years, we have many examples of the
prolongation of life to 110, and even 120.
Theſe men, however, uſed no peculiar arts for
the preſervation of their bodies. They appear,
on the contrary, to have been peaſants, huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
labourers, and people accuſtomed to abuſe
their bodies, if it be poſſible to abuſe them by
any other means than thoſe of continual idleneſs
and debauchery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:0195400702:494"/>
Beſides, the varieties of climate, and of the
modes of living, make no difference as to the
period of our exiſtence, which is the ſame in the
European, the Negro, the Chineſe, the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
the civilized man and the ſavage, the rich
and the poor, the citizen and the peaſant. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does the difference of races, of food, or of
accommodation, make any change on the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life. Men who feed upon raw fleſh or
dried fiſh, on ſago or rice, on caſſada or roots,
live as long as thoſe who are nouriſhed with
bread and prepared victuals. It is apparent,
therefore, that the duration of life has no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
either on manners or cuſtoms, or the
qualities of particular food: If luxury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
be excepted, nothing can alter thoſe
laws of mechaniſm which regulate the number
of our years.</p>
               <p>Any little differences which may be remarked
in the term of human life ſeem to be owing to
the quality of the air. There are generally
more old men in high than in low countries.
The mountains of Scotland, of Wales, of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne,
and of Switzerland, have furniſhed
more examples of extreme old age than the
plains of Holland, Flanders, Germany, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
But, taking mankind in general, there is
hardly any difference in the duration of life.
When men are not cut off by accidental diſeaſes,
they every where live 90 or 100 years. Our
anceſtors never exceeded this period; and, ſince
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:0195400702:495"/>
the age of David, it has ſuffered no variation.
If it ſhould be aſked, why the firſt races of men
lived 900, 930, and even 969 years? we may,
perhaps, be able to give a ſatisfactory anſwer.
The productions of the earth were then of a
different nature. The ſurface of the globe, as
we remarked when treating of the Theory of the
Earth, was, in the firſt ages of the world, leſs
ſolid and compact; becauſe, gravity having act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only for a ſhort time, terreſtrial bodies had
not acquired their preſent denſity and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.
The produce of the earth, therefore,
muſt have been analogous to its condition. The
ſurface being more looſe and moiſt, its produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
would, of courſe, be more ductile and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of extenſion: Their growth, therefore,
and even that of the human body, would require
a longer time of being completed. The ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ductility of the bones, muſcles, &amp;c.
would probably remain for a longer period, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every ſpecies of food was more ſoft and
ſucculent. Hence, the full expanſion of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
body, or when it was capable of generating,
muſt have required 120 or 130 years; and the
duration of life would be in proportion to the
time of growth, as is uniformly the caſe at
preſent: For, if we ſuppoſe the age of puberty,
among the firſt races of men, to have been 130
years, as they now arrive at that age in 14 years,
the age of the Antedeluvians will be in exact
proportion to that of the preſent race; ſince, by
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:0195400702:496"/>
multiplying theſe two numbers by ſeven, for
example, the age of the preſent race will be 90,
and that of the Antedeluvians will be 910. The
period of man's exiſtence, therefore, may have
gradually diminiſhed in proportion as the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the earth acquired more ſolidity by the
conſtant action of gravity; and it is probable,
that the period from the creation, to the days
of David, was ſufficient to give the earth all
the denſity it was capable of receiving from the
influence of gravitation; and, conſequently, that
the ſurface of the earth has ever ſince remained
in the ſame ſtate, and that the terms of growth
in the productions of the earth, as well as the
duration of life, have been invariably fixed
from that period.</p>
               <p>Independent of accidental diſeaſes, which are
more frequent and dangerous in the latter pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of life, old men are ſubject to natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
that originate ſolely from the decay of
the different parts of the body. The muſcles
loſe their tone, the head ſhakes, the hands trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the legs totter, the ſenſibility of the nerves
decreaſes, and every ſenſe is blunted. But the
incapacity for generating is the moſt characteriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
infirmity of old age. This impotency may
be aſcribed to two cauſes; an alteration in the
ſeminal fluid, and a want of tenſion in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
organs. The defect of tenſion is eaſily
explained from the conformation of the organ
itſelf, which is a ſpongy cavernous ſubſtance,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:0195400702:497"/>
fitted to receive into its cavities a great quantity
of blood, in order both to increaſe its ſize, and
to render it more rigid. In youth, this organ
is ſoft and flexible; and, of courſe, it is eaſily
extended by the impulſe of the blood. But, as
we advance in years, like every other part of
the body, it becomes more ſolid, and loſes its
flexibility. Hence, though the impulſe of the
blood were equal to what it was in youth, this
impulſe is unable to dilate an organ which has
become too denſe to admit blood in a quantity
ſufficient to produce an erection, that will anſwer
the purpoſes of generation.</p>
               <p>With regard to the change, or rather ſterility of
the ſeminal fluid, it cannot be prolific unleſs when
it contains organic particles tranſmitted from
every part of the body; for we have already
ſhown<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, ch. 2. 3. &amp;c.</note>, that the production of a ſmall orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
being, ſimilar to its parent, cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
without the union of the organic particles
ſent from all parts of the body. But, in very
aged men, the parts have become too ſolid, and
can neither receive, aſſimilate, nor tranſmit, the
nutritive and prolific particles. The bones and
other ſolids, therefore, can neither produce nor
tranſmit organic particles correſpondent to their
own natures; theſe particles muſt, of courſe, be
wanting in the ſeminal fluids of old men; and
this defect is ſufficient to render them incapable
of generating.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:0195400702:498"/>
But, admitting the ſterility of old men to be
owing to a defect in the organic particles of
their ſeminal fluids, this defect may ſtill be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by a young woman<note n="*" place="bottom">See above, ch. 10.</note>, which not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
happens; for old men ſometimes, though
rarely, generate; and, when they do produce,
they have a much ſmaller ſhare in their children
than young men. This is likewiſe one reaſon
why young women, who are married to old, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit,
and deformed men, often produce mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
or children ſtill more deformed than their
fathers. But this is not a proper place for ſuch
diſcuſſions.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of mankind die of the ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
the dropſy, or other diſeaſes which ſeem to
proceed from a vitiation of the blood and other
fluids. Whatever influence the fluids may have
in the animal oeconomy, they are only paſſive
and diviſible ſubſtances, and obey the impulſes
of the ſolids, which are the true organic active
parts, and upon which the motion, the quality,
and even the quantity of the fluids entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
In old age, the cavities of the veſſels
contract, the muſcles loſe their tone, the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
organs are obſtructed; the blood, the lymph,
and the other fluids, of courſe, grow viſcid, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſate,
and produce all thoſe diſeaſes and
ſymptoms which are uſually aſcribed to a vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the humours. But the natural decay of
the ſolids is the original cauſe of theſe maladies.
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:0195400702:499"/>
Though it be true, that the bad ſtate of the
fluids proceeds from a depravity in the organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſolids; yet the effects reſulting from
a change in the fluids produce the moſt alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſymptoms, if they become ſtagnant, or be
obſtructed in their circulation by the contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the veſſels; if, by the relaxation of the
veſſels, they extravaſate, they muſt ſoon corrupt,
and corrode the weaker parts of the ſolids. In
this manner the cauſes of deſtruction perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
multiply; our internal enemies grow more
and more powerful, and at laſt put a period to
our exiſtence.</p>
               <p>All the cauſes of decay which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
above, act continually upon the human
body, and gradually lead to its diſſolution. Death,
which appears ſo terrible to us, is only the laſt
term in the ſucceſſion of evils. Life begins to
decay long before it is entirely extinguiſhed;
and the changes are perhaps greater from youth
till the beginning of our decay, than from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitude
to death; for we ought here to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
life as a ſubject capable of augmentation and
of diminution. When the foetus is firſt form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the quantity of life is almoſt equal to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
It gradually extends and acquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
and force, in proportion to the growth
and expanſion of the body. On the other hand,
when the body begins to decay, the quantity of
life diminiſhes, till its final extinction. Thus
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:0195400702:500"/>
life both commences and terminates by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
degrees.</p>
               <p>Why then ſhould we be afraid of death, if
we have no reaſonable apprehenſions of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences?
Why dread this ſingle moment, which
has been preceded by an infinity of others of the
ſame order; ſince death is fully as natural as
life, and both arrive in the ſame manner, without
our being able to perceive their approach? If we
inquire of phyſicians, and thoſe who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to obſerve the actions and ſentiments of
the dying, we ſhall find, that, excepting in a few
acute diſeaſes, attended with agitations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,
which exhibit only the appearances of
pain, moſt men expire quietly, and without the
ſmalleſt indication of uneaſineſs. Even when
patients ſeem to be afflicted with the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
agonies, they have no exiſtence but in the
imagination of the ſpectator: The truth of this
has been repeatedly atteſted by many people
who have recovered after the moſt violent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
and convulſions, who, notwithſtanding,
were unable to recollect a ſingle pang they had
felt, or a ſingle idea or ſentiment that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
during this ſeemingly diſtreſsful ſituation.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of mankind, therefore, die
without being ſenſible of the fatal ſtroke; and
of thoſe who preſerve their ſenſes to the laſt
groan, there is not, perhaps, one who does not
entertain ſome hope of recovery. Nature, for
the happineſs of man, has rendered this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:0195400702:501"/>
much ſtronger than reaſon. Men never
ceaſe to flatter themſelves with hopes of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
even though they might judge of their real
condition from the example of others who had
been afflicted with the ſame incurable diſorders,
from the tears of their friends, and from the
countenances or deſertion of their phyſicians.
All theſe mortifying circumſtances are only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as premature and ill-grounded fears; and
hope never leaves us, till death ſhuts the ſcene.</p>
               <p>A ſick man tells you, that he feels the hand of
death, that the king of terrors is juſt about to
arrive, and that recovery is impoſſible: But if,
from zeal or indiſcretion, he is informed of his
approaching diſſolution, his countenance inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changes, and he betrays all that uneaſineſs
which naturally attends the firſt intimation of
death. This man, it is evident, gives no credit
to his own aſſertions. He may entertain ſome
doubts concerning his ſituation; but his hopes
are always ſuperior to his fears: And, if he were
not alarmed by that cruel parade of grief which
too often imbitters the ſick man's couch, he
would never perceive the approach of his diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>Death, therefore, is not that horrible object
which we have fancied to ourſelves. It is a
ſpectre which terrifies us at a diſtance, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears
when we come more cloſe to it. Our
conceptions of it are founded on prejudice; and
we regard it not only as the greateſt of all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:0195400702:502"/>
but as accompanied with the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating
tortures. The pain, it is ſaid, muſt
be extreme when the ſoul ſeparates from the
body; its duration may alſo be long, ſince time
is meaſured by the celerity of ideas; and one
painful moment, by augmenting the rapidity of
our ideas, may have the appearance of an age,
when the train of ideas proceeds with their
uſual gentleneſs and tranquillity. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
is ſuch an abuſe of philoſophy, that,
if it had no influence in increaſing the miſeries
of human life, it merits nothing but ſilence and
contempt. As ſuch arguments, however, gain
credit with weak minds, and render the aſpect
of death a thouſand times more hideous than
it really is, a refutation of them may be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with utility.</p>
               <p>When the ſoul is firſt united to the body, do
we feel a joy that tranſports us? No. This u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is effected without our perception; why,
then, ſhould we be conſcious of their diſſolution?
What reaſon have we to believe that the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſoul and body is attended with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
pain? What cauſe ſhould produce this
pain? Does it reſide in the ſoul or in the body?
Pain of mind can only reſult from thought; and
pain of body is always proportioned to its ſtrength
or weakneſs. At the approach of natural death,
the body is in its weakeſt ſtate, and, of courſe,
it can feel but very little, if any pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="490" facs="tcp:0195400702:503"/>
Let us now ſuppoſe a violent death: Can the
ſufferings of a man, for example, whoſe head is
carried off by a cannon-ball, be more than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous?
Can the ſucceſſion of his ideas, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this inſtant, be ſo rapid as to make the pain
ſeem to continue for an hour, a day, or a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury?
We ſhall endeavour to diſcuſs this point.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge that the ſucceſſion of our ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
is the only natural meaſure of time, and that
we conceive it to be ſhorter or longer in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the uniformity or irregularity of their
motions. But, in this meaſure, there is a unit
or ſixed point, which is neither arbitrary nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite,
but is determined by nature, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds
with the particular organization of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals.
Two ideas, which ſucceed each other,
muſt neceſſarily be ſeparated by an interval;
one thought, however rapid, muſt require
ſome portion of time before it can be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by another. No ſucceſſion can take place
in an indiviſible inſtant. The ſame remark is
applicable to ſentiment or feeling. A certain
time muſt elapſe in the tranſition from pain to
pleaſure, or from one painful ſenſation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This interval between our thoughts and
ſenſations is the unit or fixed point formerly
mentioned; and it can neither be extremely
long nor extremely ſhort, but muſt be nearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
in its duration; becauſe it depends on the
nature of the mind and the organization of the
body, the movements of which muſt have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
degree of celerity. In the ſame indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:0195400702:504"/>
therefore, there can be no ſucceſſion of
ideas ſo rapid, or ſo ſlow, as to produce that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous
difference in duration, by which a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
pain is prolonged to that of an hour, a
day, or a century.</p>
               <p>A very acute pain, if continued for a certain
time, uniformly brings on either fainting or
death. Our organs, which are only endowed
with a certain degree of force, cannot reſiſt more
than a certain quantity of pain. If the pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
exceſſive, the organs are unable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it; and, of courſe, they can tranſmit no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of it to the mind, with which there
is no correſpondence but by the diſtinct action
of theſe organs. In this caſe, the action of the
organs is interrupted; and, conſequently, all
internal ſenſation is at an end.</p>
               <p>What I have already remarked is perhaps
more than ſufficient to evince, that the inſtant
of death is neither accompanied with extreme
nor long-continued pain. But, in order to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the fears of the moſt timid of mankind,
we ſhall ſtill add a few words upon this ſubject.
Exceſſive pain extinguiſhes all reflection, though
ſome ſymptoms of it have ſometimes appeared in
the very moment of violent death. When Charles
XII. received the blow which terminated, in an
inſtant, both his enterprizes and his exiſtence,
he clapped his hand upon his ſword. This mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
pang, ſince it excluded not reflection, could
not be exceſſive. He found himſelf attacked;
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:0195400702:505"/>
he conſidered that he ought to defend himſelf;
it is evident, therefore, that he felt no greater
pain than he would have ſuffered from an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſtroke. This action could not be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of a mechanical impulſe; for I have ſhewn,
in the deſcription of man, that the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
movements of the paſſions depend upon
reflection, and are nothing but habitual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the mind.</p>
               <p>I would not have dwelt ſo long upon this
ſubject, if I had not been anxious to eradicate a
prejudice ſo repugnant to the happineſs of man.
I have ſeen many victims ſacrificed to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
eſpecially among the female ſex, who
die daily through the terror of death. Such
dreadful apprehenſions ſeem peculiarly to affect
thoſe who, by nature or education, are endowed
with ſuperior ſenſibility; for the vulgar look
forward to their diſſolution, either with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
or, at leaſt, without any degree of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>True philoſophy views objects as they exiſt.
Our internal feelings would uniformly accord
with this philoſophy, if they were not pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the illuſions of imagination, and by the
unfortunate habit of creating hypothetical phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of exceſſive pains, and of pleaſures which
exceed the limits of human nature. Objects
are only terrible or raviſhing, at a diſtance;
when we have the reſolution or the wiſdom to
take a near inſpection of them, every alarming
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:0195400702:506"/>
and every alluring circumſtance inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.</p>
               <p>If this doctrine, concerning the gradual and
generally inſenſible decay of the vital powers,
required any farther ſupport, no inconſiderable
aid might be derived to it from the uncertainty of
the ſigns of death. If we conſult the writers on this
ſubject, and particularly thoſe of Winſlow and
Bruhier, we ſhall receive full conviction, that,
between life and death, the ſhade is often ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhable,
as to elude all the powers of the
medical art. They inform us, 'That the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the face, the heat of the body, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſs
of the joints, are uncertain marks of
life; and that the paleneſs of the countenance,
the coldneſs of the body, the rigidity of the
extremities, the ceſſation of motion, and the
abolition of the ſenſes, are very equivocal ſigns
of death.' The ſame remark may be made
with regard to the apparent ceſſation of the pulſe,
and of reſpiration: Theſe motions are often ſo
ſlow, that they elude all our perceptions. A
mirror or a candle is applied near the mouth of
a ſick man; if the mirror be ſullied, or the flame
vibrates, life is concluded not to be extinguiſhed.
But theſe effects are often produced, after death
has actually taken place; and ſometimes they
appear not, though the patient be ſtill alive.
When we wiſh to be certain of the death of any
perſon, we apply fumes of tobacco, and other
irritating bodies to the noſtrils; we endeavour
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:0195400702:507"/>
to excite the organs by violent agitations, by
pricking or ſcarifying the hands and feet, by
applying red hot iron or wax to different parts
of the body, by raiſing loud and unuſual cries,
&amp;c. But inſtances have occurred where all theſe
and ſimilar trials have proved abortive; and yet,
to the aſtoniſhment of the ſpectators, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſuppoſed to be dead has afterwards recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the powers of life.</p>
               <p>Hence, nothing can be more apparent, than
that a certain condition of life has a great
reſemblance to actual death. Both humanity
and reaſon, therefore, require that we ſhould be
cautious of abandoning the body, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it too haſtily to the grave. Neither ten,
twenty, nor twenty-four hours are ſufficient to
diſtinguiſh a real from an apparent death; ſince
inſtances are not wanting of perſons returning
from the tomb at the end of two and of three
days. Why ſhould we precipitate the interment
of thoſe perſons, the prolongation of whoſe lives
we moſt ardently deſire? Why ſhould a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
ſubſiſt, in the abolition of which all men
are equally intereſted? Are not the frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes
recorded by phyſicians ſufficient to deter us
from too haſty interments? Mr Winſlow<note n="*" place="bottom">See Winſlow diſſert. ſur l'incertitude des ſignes de la mort, p. 34.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, 'That the body, though living, is
ſometimes ſo completely deprived of every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
function, that it has every external appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:0195400702:508"/>
of death. But,' he remarks, 'both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and charity require, that a reaſonable
time ſhould be allowed to diſcover whether any
ſigns of life may not ſtill manifeſt themſelves,
otherwiſe we become actual murderers, by
burying people who are not dead. If we may
credit the greateſt number of authors, three
days, or 72 hours, are ſufficient for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
If, during this period, no ſigns of life
appear, but, on the contrary, the body begins
to emit a cadaverous odor, which is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
mark of death, we may then bury it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſcruple.'</p>
               <p>We ſhall afterwards have an opportunity of
mentioning the cuſtoms of different nations with
regard to funerals, embalming, &amp;c. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part, even of the moſt ſavage people, pay more
attention than we to their departed friends:
What we eſteem a ceremony only, they regard
as a primary duty: They reſpect their dead;
they clothe them; they ſpeak to them; they
recite their exploits; they praiſe their virtues:
But we, who pretend to ſuperior ſenſibility, fly
from our dead, and inhumanly abandon them;
we deſire not to ſee them; we have neither the
courage nor the inclination to ſpeak of them;
we even avoid such objects or ſituations as might
recall the idea of them: We are, therefore, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more indifferent, or weaker than ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:0195400702:509"/>
Having thus traced the hiſtory of life and
death with regard to the individual, let us now
conſider both in relation to the whole ſpecies.
Man dies at every age; and, though the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his life be longer than that of moſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
yet it is unqueſtionably more various and
uncertain. Attempts have lately been made to
aſcertain theſe uncertainties, and, by obſervations,
to fix ſome ſtandard with regard to the morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of mankind at different periods of life. If
theſe obſervations were ſufficiently numerous
and exact, they would be of great utility in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the number of people, their increaſe,
the conſumption of proviſions, &amp;c. Many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have written with ability on this ſubject.
M. de Parcieux, of the academy of ſciences, has
lately publiſhed an excellent work for regulating
tontins and annuities. But, as his principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
was to calculate the mortality of annuitants,
and as ſuch perſons are particularly pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for their apparent ſtrength of conſtitution,
his calculations cannot be applied to mankind in
general. For the ſame reaſon, his curious tables
of the mortality of the different orders of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
muſt be confined to their proper objects.
Hally, Grant, Kerſboom, Simpſon, &amp;c. have
alſo given tables of the mortality of the human
ſpecies. But, as their obſervations have been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to the bills of mortality in a few pariſhes
of London, Breſlau, and other large towns, they
can afford little information as to the general
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:0195400702:510"/>
mortality of mankind. To make complete ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
of this kind, it is neceſſary to ſcrutinize the
pariſh-regiſters, not only of London, Paris, &amp;c.
where there is a perpetual ingreſs of ſtrangers
and egreſs of natives, but likewiſe thoſe of the
country, that, comparing the reſults of both,
general concluſions may be formed. M. Dupré
de St Maur, a member of the French Academy,
has executed this plan upon twelve pariſhes in
the country of France, and three in Paris. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained his permiſſion to publiſh his tables,
I do it the more chearfully, as they are the only
calculations by which the probability of human
life in general can be aſcertained with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of certainty.</p>

Many uſeful concluſions might be drawn from
the above tables of M. Dupré. But I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
myſelf to thoſe which regard the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the duration of life. It is obſervable,
that, in the columns under the years, 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and other round numbers,
as 25, 35, &amp;c. there are, in the country-pariſhes,
more deaths than in the preceding or ſubſequent
columns. This is owing to the ages not being
juſtly regiſtered, moſt country-people not being
able to aſcertain their ages within leſs than two
or three years. If they die at 58 or 59, they
are regiſtered at 60, and ſo of other round num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
But this irregularity gives riſe to no great
inconvenience, as it can eaſily be corrected by
the manner in which the numbers ſucceed each
other in the tables.</p>
               <p>It appears from the tables of the country-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
that one half of the children die nearly
about the end of the fourth year; but, from the
Paris table, it appears that 16 years are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to produce the ſame effect. This great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
proceeds from the general practice of
the Pariſians ſending their children to be nurſed
in the country, which neceſſarily increaſes the
number of deaths during the firſt years of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.
In the following calculation, I have
eſtimated the probabilities of the duration of life
from a combination of both tables; which muſt,
therefore, make a very near approach to the
truth.</p>

more; that a man of 20 years will live 33 and
5 months more; and that a man of 30 years
will live 28 more, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It may be farther obſerved, 1. That 7 years is
the age at which the longeſt duration of life is
to be expected; for there is then an equal chance
of ſurviving 42 years 3 months; 2. That, at 12
years, one fourth of life is expired, ſince we
have no reaſon to hope for above 38 or 39 years
more; 3. That at 28 or 29 years, we have lived
one half of our days, ſince there are only 28
more to be expected; and, laſtly, That, at the
age of 50, three fourths of life are gone, the
remaining chance extending only to 16 or 17
years longer.</p>
               <p>But theſe phyſical truths, however mortifying,
may be alleviated by moral conſiderations. The
firſt 15 years of our exiſtence may be regarded
as nothing: Every thing that paſſes during this
long period, is either obliterated from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
or has ſo little connection with the views
and objects which afterwards occupy our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it ceaſes entirely to be intereſting.
The train of our ideas, and even the nature of
our exiſtence, ſuffer a total change. We begin
not to live, in a moral ſenſe, till after we have
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:0195400702:532"/>
learned to arrange our thoughts, to direct them
towards futurity, to aſſume a kind of conſiſtency
of character ſimilar to that ſtate at which we
are ultimately deſtined to arrive. Conſidering
the duration of life in this point of view, which
is the only real one, at the age of 25, we have
only paſſed one fourth of our days, at the age
of 38, one half, and, at the age of 56, three
fourths.</p>
