            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I SELDOM write Dedications. Whenever I have written one, it has been from an impulſe of veneration, or of tender grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. THE BELLE's STRATAGEM I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to <hi>her Majeſty</hi>; THE TOWN BEFORE YOU is dedicated to <hi>you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The virtues which you practiſe in your elegant pavilions at GASSARY, have

reach'd the Britiſh ſhores. Their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now echoes back again to thoſe of the Ganges; and I would perſuade myſelf that I may be the cauſe of extending it ſtill farther. Yes, I would hope that this humble pen may ſpeak to thoſe of after times, and tell them that you <hi>quietly</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch acts of graceful goodneſs, as open a thouſand mouths in your praiſe, whilſt you perſuade yourſelf that all is ſecret, and that no one finds you out to be more amiable and reſpected, than the generality of human creatures.</p>
            <p>This ſelf deception is a little help'd on, by him, to whom of all earthly beings you are bound to look up. He <hi>aids</hi> your charming impoſitions—he <hi>aſſiſts</hi> you in fixing fetters of gratitude on all around you, and then perſuades himſelf and you, that Heaven alone is privy to the deed. But you could not hope always to go on

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following is rather the Comedy which the Public have choſen it to be, than the Comedy which I intended. Some things have been left out, and ſome have been added ſince the firſt repreſentation: In ſhort, the Comedy has been <hi>new claſs'd</hi>—it has been torn from its genus.</p>
            <p>It is hoped, however, that there may be found cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, in THE TOWN BEFORE YOU, to intereſt, and ſituations to attach; and that thoſe events which were vivacity in the Theatre, will not be dulneſs in the cloſet.</p>
            <p>But it muſt be noticed, that the ſcene, in the ſecond act, between TIPPY and his Landlady, and that in the fifth act, between TIPPY and the Bailiff, were no part of my original deſign. They were written during the illneſs of MRS. POPE, after the Piece had been played ſeveral nights. Alas! I am ſorry to remark, that no ſcenes in the Comedy (to uſe the Stage idiom) <hi>go off</hi> better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0447800700:7"/>An acute Critic lately ſaid, in one of thoſe aſſemblies where converſation, though ſometimes light, is ſeldom without meaning, "A Comedy to pleaſe, in the preſent day, muſt be <hi>made,</hi> not written." It requires no great expanſe of comprehenſion to perceive the meaning of this dogma; the truth of which I am equally ready to acknowledge, and to deplore: But ſhould it <hi>want</hi> illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, it may be found every week in a popular Piece, where a great Actor, holding a ſword in his left hand, and making aukward puſhes with it, charms the audience infinitely more than he could do, by all the wit and obſervation which the ingenious Author might have given him; and brings down ſuch applauſes, as the bewitching dialogue of CIBBER, and of FAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUHAR pants for in vain!</p>
            <p>The patient developement of character, the repeated touches which colour it up to Nature, and ſwell it into identity and exiſtence (and which gave celebrity to CONGREVE), we have now no reliſh for. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of intereſt, the ſtrokes which are meant to reach the heart, we are equally incapable of taſting. LAUGH! LAUGH! LAUGH! is the demand: Not a word muſt be uttered that looks like inſtruction, or a ſentence which ought to be remembered.</p>
            <p>From a Stage, in ſuch a ſtate, it is time to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw; but I call on my younger cotemporaries, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the riſing generation, to <hi>correct</hi> a taſte which, to be gratified, demands neither genius or intellect;— which aſks only a happy knack at inventing TRICK. I adjure them to reſtore to the Drama SENSE, OBSER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATION,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0447800700:8"/>
WIT, LESSON! and to teach our Writers to reſpect their own talents.</p>
            <p>What mother can now lead her daughters to the great National School, THE THEATRE, in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their receiving either poliſh or improvement? Should the luckleſs Bard ſtumble on a reflection, or a ſentiment, the audience yawn, and wait for the next tumble from a chair, or a tripping up of the heels, to put them into attention. Surely I ſhall be forgiven for ſatiriſing myſelf; I have <hi>made</hi> ſuch things, and I bluſh to have made them.</p>
            <p>O! GENIUS of a poliſh'd age, deſcend!—plant thy banners in our Theatres, and bid ELEGANCE and FEEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING take place of the <hi>droll</hi> and the <hi>laugh,</hi> which formerly were found only in the Booths of <hi>Bartlemy</hi> Fair, and were divided between <hi>Flocton</hi> and <hi>Yates!</hi> With actors capable of giving force to all that is intellectual, is it not <hi>pity</hi> to condemn them to ſuch drudgery? THEY are no longer neceſſary. Let Sadler's Wells and the Circus empty themſelves of their performers to furniſh our Stage; the expence to Managers will be leſs, and their buſineſs will be carried on better. The UNDERSTANDING, DISCERNMENT, and EDUCATION, which diſtinguiſh our modern actors, are uſeleſs to them;—ſtrong muſcles are in greater repute, and grimace has more powerful attraction.</p>

                  <l>AH! ah! you're here, and comfortably tight?</l>
                  <l>Well ſqueez'd and preſs'd, I ſee—from left to right.</l>
                  <l>Waiting the moment when the curtain riſes,</l>
                  <l>Gaſping for plots, adventures, and ſurpriſes!</l>
                  <l>Were I a Poet—a Dramatic Wit,</l>
                  <l>And by the Stage Tarantula were bit,</l>
                  <l>My Prologue ſhou'd, as was the good old way,</l>
                  <l>A word or two upon <hi>the ſubject ſay</hi>;</l>
                  <l>Hint a looſe outline of the ſcene within,</l>
                  <l>And let you gueſs the whole ere we begin.</l>
                  <l>In preſent times, the Prologue and its Play,</l>
                  <l>Are as near kin as Michaelmas and May—</l>
                  <l>Confin'd, then, not to ſay a word of <hi>that,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>I'll tell a ſtory—and I have one pat.</l>

                  <l>A Boniface of late, placed near his door,</l>
                  <l>"Good larders here, of genuine wines, rich ſtore."</l>
                  <l>In gold the gaudy invitation hung,</l>
                  <l>And to the ſhifting Zephyrs gently ſwung.</l>
                  <l>It chanc'd a traveller, with ſtomach keen,</l>
                  <l>Leapt from his Rozinante, tir'd and lean,</l>
                  <l>'Talk'd of his ſupper, with an eager air—</l>

                  <l>I'll have ſtewed carp, he cried, and chicken roaſt.</l>
                  <l>And, bring me, of the Burgundy you boaſt.</l>
                  <l>Y—e—s, Sir, the ſtaring, curtfying Damſel ſaid,</l>
                  <l>And, in a trice, the table-cloth was laid.</l>
                  <l>I am my own man, he adds, in accents bold,</l>

                  <l>At length came back the pretty, ſimpering Kate,</l>
                  <l>And plac'd—two eggs upon his lonely plate.</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>The gueſt fatigued, enraged, the Inn forſook,</l>

                  <l>His food was wholeſome, and his room not mean.</l>
                  <l>So—not to raiſe high hopes, we cannot meet,</l>
                  <l>We truſt this night's <hi>plain</hi> fare is freſh and ſweet;</l>

<q>I am ſorry to differ from Mr. Deputy
<stage>(ſpeaking gruffly);</stage>
but I contend that theſe innovations bode no good to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. The hour for dining, ſince my time, was two; it has been three, four, and ſix; and I ſuſpect ſhortly it may be eight— hum! I move, therefore, that a petition be preſented to the Lord Mayor—hum— hum—</q>

                  <speaker>Aſgill.</speaker>
                  <p>But you mentioned Lady Horatia; and the moment her idea is preſented to me, every other is ſwallowed up. O! Conway, ſhe engroſſes my whole ſoul—to ſee her is bliſs, and the ſound of her voice is rapture.</p>

I thank you; but your eulogy is not compleat, for the purity of my Horatia chaſtiſes the art ſhe loves.

                  <p>Yes, I think I will go; and if I find her worthy my SIDNEY—O! but ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be worthy! birth, and beauty and riches are all fine things; but when put into the ſcale againſt ſuch innate goodneſs; ſuch an upright mind; ſuch rectitude of character, it is weighing jewels againſt droſs!

                     <hi>Affected</hi> pleaſantry, Mr. Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, is the poor refuge of an uneaſy heart. The converſation which has paſſed in the next room with Mr. Tippy, I have heard; and I fear you have an action in contemplation which will hereafter give you remorſe.</p>

horridly mad if I cheat him of a thouſand pounds; but if I ſwindle his neighbour out of it, he laughs, and ſays,

                  <p>O! 'tis in vain! never, Conway, will I ſue for compaſſion from a proud beauty, who
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0447800700:64"/>

                  <p>Pride and lovelineſs ought to go together. I diſlike the vulgar railing againſt the haughtineſs of conſcious beauty. She, who <hi>over</hi> values herſelf, will never ſink too low; and the lady of whom we ſpeak, perhaps loves you.</p>

                  <p>For that very reaſon, I will not again appear before her. <hi>I</hi> am too proud to raiſe a conflict in her boſom between her pride, and her tenderneſs, and to owe at length, perhaps, to her <hi>compaſſion,</hi> the acceptance to which her love would never have acceded.</p>

The very conduct which from a vulgar mind would diſguſt, from ſuch elegance and virtue becomes faſcinating. Now, Aſgill, I will dare to ſeek thee; and I will pour ſuch tranſport on thy heart, as ſhall make thee confeſs, the hour of thy poverty the moſt bleſſed of thy life.

                  <p>Sir Robert, I have often heard of the politeneſs of the Welch gentlemen, and you really confirm all that has been ſaid. The year in which you were ſheriff, Sir Robert, was ſuch a year of ſplendour and magnificence, as Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morganſhire will long remember. We heard a vaſt deal of it at Saint James's; it amuſed the Royal Circle for a month.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Robert.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, my lord, I did my beſt on that occaſion. When I was high ſheriff for the county, I neither ſpared myſelf or my purſe. A hanging in the morning, and an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at night; giving the judges a dinner to-day, and to-morrow conſulting Jack Ketch about a new gallows. Such a variety of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my lord, demands a man's whole atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Certainly, certainly. A little thing happened this morning, Sir Robert, which has given me pain. You addreſſed me in the Park, I really was, at that moment, throwing over in my mind the compact between Ruſſia and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. In ſhort, I had almoſt determined to go to Saint Peterſburgh, ambaſſador myſelf; for I think one or two points might be reviſed. At that very moment, Sir Robert, juſt as I was

bounds with diſdain from ſuch frozen rules! I, who have hitherto treated you with coldneſs, almoſt bordering on diſdain, now declare, in the preſence of my friends, that I am proud to make you maſter of my fate; that I feel exalted in having it in my power to confer happineſs on you.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Aſgill, you muſt, indeed, love Sir Simon; but I know not how I ſhall ſet about doing ſo; he hates the arts; he thinks there is nothing dignified in ſculpture; he hears, without veneration, the names of Phidias, and Michael Angelo.</p>

who could fly from me to the boiſterous ocean, and prove ſuch inſenſibility to beauty and love.</p>

Yet the enthuſiaſm which ſeized me, when I trod the deck of the Victory, can never be chill'd! In the glorious tars around me, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, intrepidity, heroiſm, ſhone forth with all their fires; they flaſhed through my heart! And, I ſwear, that ſhould my country need my aſſiſtance, I will again reſume the trowſers,

            <head>EPILOGUE, MISS WALLIS.</head>
            <l>THROUGH five long Acts—a pretty decent ſwing—</l>
            <l>I've been a giddy, tender, harmleſs thing;</l>
            <l>Light as a feather, in the morn of May,</l>
            <l>Borne by the perfum'd breath of blue-eyed day.</l>
            <l>Nor have I yet thrown by my <hi>ſtudied</hi> part,</l>
            <l>GEORGINA, ſtill I am, in garb, and heart—</l>
            <l>GEORGINA humbly ſtands again before ye,</l>
            <l>Of gratitude ſo full!—ſhe half adores ye.</l>
            <l>It puzzles me to gueſs, when Conway's wife,</l>
            <l>On what ſweet plan to form my married life:</l>
            <l>My heart beats high to think how I ſhall flaſh,</l>
            <l>Pre-eminent, and bold, like Lady Daſh.</l>
            <l>Reflection ne'er to me ſhall be a damper,</l>
            <l>My curricle I'll drive—on horſeback ſcamper—</l>
            <l>Keep Pharo Banks—take the long odds at races,</l>
            <l>And know the knowing ones, in all their paces;</l>
            <l>Lounge at Newmarket in the betting-rooms,</l>
            <l>And prate to Lady Harriet—and my grooms.</l>
            <l>But whilſt I thus blaze on, in Folly's road,</l>
            <l>And profligate, forſake my bleſt abode—</l>
            <l>Where is my huſband's peace?—his honour—where?</l>
            <l>Who ſhall his lonely hours conſole, and ſhare?</l>
            <l>O! the black proſpect ſcares my trembling art,</l>
            <l>And from the headlong precipice I ſtart.</l>
            <l>Dear <hi>wedded happineſs!</hi> my ſoul is thine,</l>
            <l>My pride ſhall be, in thy mild paths to ſhine—</l>
            <l>My CONWAY's temperate joys I'll make my own,</l>
            <l>And <hi>his</hi> felicity my life ſhall crown;</l>
            <l>With <hi>him</hi> through Pleaſure's paths I'll ſometimes roam,</l>
            <l>But ſtill my <hi>firſt enjoyment,</hi> ſhall be HOME.</l>
            <l>The Houſehold Gods ten thouſand graces wear.</l>
            <l>Nor ſtoop to borrow tinſel'd, <hi>foreign</hi> glare—</l>
            <l>Yet never ſhall your Houſehold Deities frown,</l>
            <l>Though you ſhould ſteal an hour, to ſee—THE TOWN!</l>
