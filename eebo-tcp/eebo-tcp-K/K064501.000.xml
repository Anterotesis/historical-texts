            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS
FOR
CONTENTMENT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HUMAN life has been ſaid to reſemble
the ſituation of ſpectators in a theatre,
where, whilſt each perſon is engaged by the
ſcene which paſſes before him, no one thinks
about the place in which he is ſeated. It is
only when the buſineſs is interrupted, or
when the ſpectator's attention to it grows
idle and remiſs, that he begins to conſider at
all, who is before him or who is behind
him, whether others are better accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
than himſelf, or whether many be not
much worſe. It is thus with the various
ranks and ſtations of ſociety. So long as a
man is intent upon the duties and concerns of
his own condition, he never thinks of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with any other; he is never troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with reflections upon the different claſſes
and orders of mankind, the advantages or
diſadvantages of each, the neceſſity or
non-neceſſity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0600200500:3"/>
of civil diſtinctions, much leſs
does he feel within himſelf a diſpoſition to
covet or envy any of them. He is too much
taken up with the occupations of his calling,
its purſuits, cares, and buſineſs, to beſtow
unprofitable meditations upon the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in which he ſees others placed. And
by this means a man of a ſound and active
mind has, in his very conſtitution, a remedy
againſt the diſturbance of envy and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
Theſe paſſions gain no admittance
into his breaſt, becauſe there is no leiſure
there or vacancy for the trains of thought
which generate them. He enjoys therefore
eaſe in this reſpect, and eaſe reſulting from
the beſt cauſe, the power of keeping his
imagination at home; of conſining it to
what belongs to himſelf, inſtead of ſending
it forth to wander amongſt ſpeculations
which have neither limits nor uſe, amidſt
views of unattainable grandeur, fancied hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
of extolled, becauſe unexperienced,
privileges and delights.</p>
            <p>The wiſeſt advice that can be given is,
never to allow our attention to dwell upon
compariſons between our own condition and
that of others, but to keep it fixed upon the
duties and concerns of the condition itſelf.
But ſince every man has not this power;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0600200500:4"/>
ſince the minds of ſome men will be buſy
in contemplating the advantages which they
ſee others poſſeſs, and ſince perſons in labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſtations of life are wont to view the
higher ranks of ſociety, with ſentiments
which not only tend to make themſelves
unhappy, but which are very different from
the truth, it may be an uſeful office to
point out to them ſome of theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which, if they <hi>will</hi> turn their thoughts
to the ſubject, they ſhould endeavour to take
fairly into the account.</p>
            <p>And firſt, we are moſt of us apt to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
when we ſee exorbitant fortunes pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the hands of ſingle perſons; larger,
we are ſure, than they can want, or, as we
think, than they can uſe. This is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a reflection that I will not ſay it is not
natural. But whenever the complaint comes
into our minds, we ought to recollect, that
the thing happens in conſequence of thoſe
very rules and laws which ſecure to ourſelves
our property, be it ever ſo ſmall. The laws
which accidentally caſt enormous eſtates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one great man's poſſeſſion, are, after all,
the ſelf ſame laws which protect and guard
the poor man. Fixed rules of property are
eſtabliſhed, for one as well as another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing, before hand, whom they may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0600200500:5"/>
affect. If theſe rules ſometimes throw an
exceſſive or diſproportionate ſhare to one
man's lot, who can help it? It is much
better that it ſhould be ſo, than that the
rules themſelves ſhould be broken up: and
you can only have one ſide of the alternative
or the other. To aboliſh riches would not
be to aboliſh poverty; but, on the contrary,
to leave it without protection or reſource.
It is not for the poor man to repine at the
effects of laws and rules by which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is benefited every hour of his exiſtence;
which ſecure to him his earnings, his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
his bread, his life; without which he,
no more than the rich man, could either
eat his meal in quietneſs, or go to bed in
ſafety. Of the two, it is rather more the
concern of the poor to ſtand up for the laws
than of the rich; for it is the law which
defends the weak againſt the ſtrong, the
humble againſt the powerful, the little
againſt the great; and weak and ſtrong,
humble and powerful, little and great there
would be, even were there no laws whatever.
Beſide; what after all is the miſchief? The
owner of a great eſtate does not eat or drink
more than the owner of a ſmall one. His
fields do not produce worſe crops, nor does
the produce maintain fewer mouths. If
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0600200500:6"/>
eſtates were more equally divided, would
greater numbers be fed, or clothed, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed?
Either therefore large fortunes are
not a public evil, or, if they be in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
an evil, it is to be borne with for the
ſake of thoſe fixed and general rules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
property, in the preſervation and
ſteadineſs of which all are intereſted.</p>
            <p>Fortunes however of any kind, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing, can only fall to the lot of a
few. I ſay, "from the nature of the thing."
The very utmoſt that can be done by laws
and government, is to enable every man,
who hath health, to procure a healthy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
for himſelf and a family. Where
this is the caſe, things are at their perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They have reached their limit. Were
the princes and nobility, the legiſlators and
counſellors of the land, all of them, the beſt
and wiſeſt men that ever lived, their united
virtue and wiſdom could do no more than
this. They, if any ſuch there be, who
would teach you to expect more, give you
no inſtance where more has ever been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>But Providence which foreſaw, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
indeed, the neceſſity to which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
affairs are ſubjected, and againſt which
it were impious to complain, hath contrived
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0600200500:7"/>
that, whilſt fortunes are only for a few, the
reſt of mankind may be happy without
them. And this leads us to conſider the
comparative advantages and comforts which
belong to the condition of thoſe, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
as the great maſs of every people do and
muſt ſubſiſt, by perſonal labour, and the
ſolid reaſons they have for contentment in
their ſtations. I do not now uſe the terms
poor and rich, becauſe that man is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
poor, of whatever rank he be, and
ſuffers the pains of poverty, whoſe expences
exceed his reſources; and no man is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſpeaking, poor but he. But I at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
conſider the advantages of thoſe labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conditions of life, which compoſe the
great portion of every human community.</p>
            <p>And, firſt, it is an ineſtimable bleſſing of
ſuch ſituations, that they ſupply a conſtant
train of employment both to body and
mind. A huſbandman, or a manufacturer,
or a tradeſman, never goes to bed at night
without having his buſineſs to riſe up to in
the morning. He would underſtand the
value of this advantage, did he know that
the want of it compoſes one of the greateſt
plagues of the human ſoul; a plague by
which the rich, eſpecially thoſe who inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
riches, are exceedingly oppreſſed. Indeed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0600200500:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is to get rid of it, that is to ſay, it is to
have ſomething to do, that they are driven
upon thoſe ſtrange and unaccountable ways
of paſſing their time, in which we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſee them, to our ſurpriſe, engaged. A poor man's condition ſupplies him with
that, which no man can do without, and
which a rich man, with all his opportunities
and all his contrivance, can hardly ſupply
himſelf, regular engagement, buſineſs to
look forward to, ſomething to be done for
every day, ſome employment prepared for
every morning. A few of better judgement
can ſeek out for themſelves conſtant and
uſeful occupation. There is not one of you
takes the pains in his calling, which ſome of
the moſt independent men in the nation
have taken, and are taking, to promote what
they deem to be a point of great concern to
the intereſts of humanity, by which neither
they nor theirs can ever gain a ſhilling, and in
which, ſhould they ſucceed, thoſe who are to
be benefited by their ſervice, will never know
nor thank them for it. I only mention this
to ſhow, in conjunction with what has been
obſerved above, that of thoſe who are at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to act as they pleaſe, the wiſe prove, and the
fooliſh confeſs, by their conduct, that a life
of employment is the only life worth lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0600200500:9"/>
and that the chief difference between
their manner of paſſing their time and yours
is, that they can chuſe the objects of their
activity, which you cannot. This privilege
may be an advantage to ſome, but for nine
out of ten it is fortunate, that occupation is
provided to their hands, that they have it
not to ſeek, that it is impoſed upon them
by their neceſſities and occaſions; for the
conſequence of liberty in this reſpect would
be, that, loſt in the perplexity of chooſing,
they would ſink into irrecoverable indolence,
inaction, and unconcern; into that vacancy
and tireſomeneſs of time and thought which
are inſeparable from ſuch a ſituation. A
man's thoughts muſt be going. Whilſt he
is awake, the working of his mind is as
conſtant as the beating of his pulſe. He
can no more ſtop the one than the other.
Hence if our thoughts have nothing to act
upon, they act upon ourſelves. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a corroſive quality. They become in
the laſt degree irkſome and tormenting.
Wherefore that ſort of equable engagement,
which takes up the thoughts ſufficiently, yet
ſo as to leave them capable of turning to
any thing more important, as occaſions offer
or require, is a moſt invaluable bleſſing. And
if the induſtrious, be not ſenſible of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0600200500:10"/>
it is for no other reaſon than becauſe
they have never experienced, or rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
the want of it.</p>
            <p>Again; ſome of the neceſſities which
poverty (if the condition of the labouring
part of mankind muſt be ſo called) impoſes,
are not hardſhips but pleaſures. Frugality
itſelf is a pleaſure. It is an exerciſe of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and contrivance, which, whenever it
is ſucceſsful, produces ſatisfaction. The
very care and forecaſt that are neceſſary to
keep expences and earnings upon a level
form, when not embarraſſed by too great
difficulties, are an agreeable engagement of
the thoughts. This is loſt amidſt abundance.
There is no pleaſure in taking out of a large
unmeaſured fund. They who do that, and
only that, are the mere conveyors of money
from one hand to another.</p>
            <p>A yet more ſerious advantage which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in inferior ſtations poſſeſs, is the caſe
with which they provide for their children.
All the proviſion which a poor man's child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
is contained in two words, "induſtry
and innocence." With theſe qualities, tho'
without a ſhilling to ſet him forwards, he
goes into the world prepared to become an
uſeful, virtuous, and happy man. Nor
will he fail to meet with a maintenance
adequate to the habits with which he has
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0600200500:11"/>
been brought up, and to the expectations
which he has formed; a degree of ſucceſs
ſufficient for a perſon of any condition
whatever. Theſe qualities of induſtry and
innocence, which, I repeat again, are all that
are abſolutely neceſſary, every parent can
give to his children without expence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he can give them by his own authority
and example; and they are to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
I believe, and preſerved in no
other way. I call this a ſerious advantage
of humble ſtations, becauſe, in what we reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuperior ranks of life, there is a real dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in placing children in ſituations,
which may in any degree ſupport them in
the claſs and in the habits in which they
have been brought up with their parents:
from which great and oftentimes diſtreſſing
perplexity the poor are free. With health
of body, innocency of mind, and habits of
induſtry, a poor man's child has nothing to
be afraid of; nor his father or mother any
thing to be afraid of for him.</p>
            <p>The labour of the world is carried on by
<hi>ſervice,</hi> that is, by one man working under
another man's direction. I take it for
granted, that this is the beſt way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
buſineſs, becauſe all nations and
ages have adopted it. Conſequently ſervice

indifferent, and nothing more. The luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0600200500:14"/>
receive no greater pleaſures from their
dainties, than the peaſant does from his
homely fare. But here is the difference.
The peaſant, whenever he goes abroad, finds
a feaſt, whereas the epicure muſt be ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
entertained to eſcape diſguſt. They
who ſpend every day in diverſions, and they
who go every day about their uſual buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
paſs their time much alike. Attending
to what they are about, wanting nothing,
regretting nothing, they are both, whilſt
engaged, in a ſtate of eaſe; but then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſuſpends the purſuits of the man of
diverſion diſtreſſes him, whereas to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer
or the man of buſineſs every pauſe is
a recreation. And this is a vaſt advantage
which they poſſeſs who are trained and
inured to a life of occupation, above the man
who ſets up for a life of pleaſure. Variety is
ſoon exhauſted. Novelty itſelf is no longer
new. A muſements are become too familiar
to delight, and he is in a ſituation in which
he can never change but for the worſe.</p>
            <p>Another article, which the poor are apt to
envy in the rich, is their <hi>caſe.</hi> Now here
they miſtake the matter totally. They call
inaction eaſe, whereas nothing is farther
from it. Reſt is eaſe. That is true. But no
man can reſt who has not worked. Reſt is the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0600200500:15"/>
ceſſation of labour. It cannot therefore be
enjoyed, or even taſted, except by thoſe who
have known fatigue. The rich ſee, and not
without envy, the refreſhment and pleaſure
which reſt affords to the poor, and chuſe to
wonder that they cannot find the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
in being free from the neceſſity of
working at all. They do not obſerve that
this enjoyment muſt be purchaſed by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
labour, and that he who will not pay
the prices, cannot have the gratification.
Being without work is one thing; repoſing
from work is another. The one is as tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and inſipid, as the other is ſweet and
ſoothing. The one in general is the fate of
the rich man, the other is the fortune of the
poor. I have heard it ſaid that if the face
of happineſs can any where be ſeen, it is in
the ſummer evening of a country village.
Where, after the labours of the day, each
man, at his door, with his children, amongſt
his neighbours, feels his frame and his heart
at reſt, every thing about him pleaſed and
pleaſing, and a delight and complacency in
his ſenſations far beyond what either luxury
or diverſion can afford. The rich want this;
and they want what they muſt never have.</p>
            <p>As to ſome other things which the poor
are diſpoſed to envy in the condition of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0600200500:16"/>
rich, ſuch as their ſtate, their appearance,
the grandeur of their houſes, dreſs, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
and attendance, they only envy the
rich theſe things, becauſe they do not know
the rich. They have not opportunities of
obſerving with what neglect and inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
the rich poſſeſs and regard theſe things
themſelves. If they could ſee the great
man in his retirement, and in his actual
manner of life, they would find him, if
pleaſed at all, taking pleaſure in ſome of
thoſe ſimple enjoyments which they can
command as well as he. They would find
him amongſt his children, in his huſbandry,
in his garden, purſuing ſome rural diverſion,
or occupied with ſome trifling exerciſe,
which are all gratifications, as much within
the power and reach of the poor man, as of
the rich; or rather more ſo.</p>
            <p>To learn the art of contentment, is only
to learn what happineſs actually conſiſts in.
Senſual pleaſures add little to its ſubſtance.
Eaſe, if by that be meant exemption from
labour, contributes nothing. One, however,
conſtant ſpring of ſatisfaction, and almoſt
infallible ſupport of chearfulneſs and ſpirits,
is the exerciſe of domeſtic affections; the
preſence of objects of tenderneſs and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in our families, our kindred, our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0600200500:17"/>
friends. Now have the poor any thing to
complain of here? Are they not ſurrounded
by their relatives as generally as others.
The poor man has his wife and children
about him; and what has the rich man
more? He has the ſame enjoyment of
their ſociety, the ſame ſolicitude for their
welfare, the ſame pleaſure in their good
qualities, improvement and ſucceſs: their
connection with him is as ſtrict and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
their attachment as ſtrong, their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
as warm. I have no propenſity to
envy any one, leaſt of all the rich and great;
but if I were diſpoſed to this weakneſs, the
ſubject of my envy would be, a healthy
young man, in full poſſeſſion of his ſtrength
and faculties, going forth in a morning to
work for his wife and children, or bringing
them home his earnings at night.</p>
            <p>But was difference of rank or fortune of
more importance to perſonal happineſs than
it is, it would be ill purchaſed by any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
or violent change of condition. An
alteration of circumſtances, which breaks up
a man's habits of life, deprives him of his
occupation, removes him from his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
may be called an elevation of
fortune, but hardly ever brings with it an
addition of enjoyment. They to whom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0600200500:18"/>
of this ſort have happened never
found them to anſwer their expectations.
After the firſt hurry of the change is over,
they are ſurpriſed to feel in themſelves,
liſtleſſneſs and dejection, a conſciouſneſs of
ſolitude, vacancy and reſtraint, in the place
of chearfulneſs, liberty, and eaſe. They try
to make up for what they have loſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by a beaſtly ſottiſhneſs, ſometimes by
a fooliſh diſſipation, ſometimes by a ſtupid
ſloth; all which effects are only ſo many
confeſſions, that changes of this ſort were
not made for man. If any public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance
ſhould produce not an equality,
(for that is not the proper name to give it)
but a jumble of ranks and profeſſions
amongſt us, it is not only evident what the
rich would loſe, but there is alſo this further
miſfortune, that what the rich loſt the poor
would not gain. I (God knows) could not
get my livelihood by labour, nor would the
labourer find any ſolace or enjoyment in my
ſtudies. If we were to exchange conditions
to-morrow, all the effect would be, that we
both ſhould be more miſerable, and the
work of both be worſe done. Without deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
therefore, what might be very difficult
to decide, which of our two conditions was
better to begin with, one point is certain,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0600200500:19"/>
that it is beſt for each to remain in his
own. The change, and the only change, to
be deſired, is that gradual and progreſſive
improvement of our circumſtances, which
is the natural fruit of ſucceſsful induſtry;
when each year is ſomething better than the
laſt; when we are enabled to add to our
little houſehold one article after another of
new comfort or conveniency, as our profits
increaſe, or our burthen becomes leſs; and,
what is beſt of all, when we can afford, as
our ſtrength declines, to relax our labours,
or divide our cares. This may be looked
forward to, and is practicable, by great
numbers, in a ſtate of public order and
quiet, it is abſolutely impoſſible in any
other.</p>
            <p>If in comparing the different conditions
of ſocial life we bring religion into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
the argument is ſtill eaſier. Religion
ſmooths all inequalities, becauſe it unfolds a
proſpect which makes all earthly diſtinctions
nothing. And I do allow that there are
many caſes of ſickneſs, affliction, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
which Chriſtianity alone can comfort.
But in eſtimating the mere diverſities of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and civil condition, I have not thought
it neceſſary to introduce religion into the
enquiry at all, becauſe I contend, that the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0600200500:20"/>
man who murmurs and repines, when he
has nothing to murmur and repine about,
but the mere want of independent property,
is not only irreligious, but ill founded and
unreaſonable in his complaint; and that he
would find, did he know the truth, and
conſider his caſe fairly, that a life of labour,
ſuch I mean as is led by the labouring part
of mankind in this country, has advantages
in it, which compenſate all its inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
When compared with the life of the
rich, it is better in theſe important reſpects.
It ſupplies employment, it promotes activity.
It keeps the body in better health, the mind
more engaged, and, of courſe, more quiet.
It is more ſenſible of eaſe, more ſuſceptible
of pleaſure. It is attended with greater ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
of ſpirits, a more conſtant chearfulneſs
and ſerenity of temper. It affords eaſier
and more certain methods of ſending chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
into the world in ſituations ſuited to
their habits and expectations. It is free
from many heavy anxieties which rich men
feel; it is fraught with many ſources of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
which they want.</p>
            <p>If to theſe reaſons for contentment the
reflecting huſbandman or artificer adds
another very material one, that changes of
condition, which are attended with a breaking
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0600200500:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
up and ſacrifice of our ancient courſe
and habit of living, never can be productive
of happineſs, he will perceive, I truſt, that
to covet the ſtations or fortunes of the rich,
or ſo however to covet them, as to wiſh to
ſeize them by force, or through the medium
of public uprore and confuſion, is not only
wickedneſs, but folly; as miſtaken in the
end, as in the means; <hi>that it is not only to
venture out to ſea in ſtorm, but to venture for
nothing.</hi>
