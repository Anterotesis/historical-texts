            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the ſtrongeſt of theſe circumſtances: but
let us remember their ſituation at that
time. It has been ſolemnly depoſed to
that they were then very poor, we are
therefore bound to believe they were ſo.
The bill of 1979 livres which Sir John
carried with him from Rheims, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to a man of his character, who was
ſo diſſipated, ſo profuſe, and I will ſay,
ſo generous, that upon his receiving a
ſum of money, no body could ſay how
much of it was engaged for debt, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if half an hour after, a ſix pence of
it would be in his pocket.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sir John and Lady Jane were anxious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from the duke of Douglas their being at Paris, and this fully explained.</note>As I would not ſplit hairs about every
trifle, which has been the great art of the
plaintiffs, I ſhall not inſiſt that Sir John
and Lady Jane were in real poverty, but
ſurely it cannot be denied that they at
the time pretended poverty; for they
wrote to the duke of Douglas in a very
affecting ſtrain upon that head, and they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0652401300:51"/>
borrowed money from M. Andrieux, at
Rheims, with whom they had then very
little connection. That being the caſe,
they were anxious to conceal from the
duke their having gone to Paris; for, ſaid
they, the duke will be offended at our
ſeeming extravagance, and will very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
obſerve, here are two people crying for
want, and yet they have left Rheims and
have taken a fooliſh journey to Paris. To
ſend money to ſuch people, would be
like throwing it into a ſieve.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Therefore they uſed ſo many methods of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment.</note>Sir John and Lady Jane were thus in a
dilemma. She could give no good reaſon
for having left Rheims, as there was
very able aſſiſtance to be had there for
women with child. She had run off in
a pannick, as women in that ſituation do
often take moſt unaccountable pannicks.
She and her huſband therefore thought
they had nothing for it but if poſſible to
keep this journey from the knowledge of
the duke, therefore it was that they lived
in a private manner at Paris: therefore it
was that they dated their letters at
Rheims; therefore it was that Sir John,
though very fond of his countrymen,
prevailed with himſelf to refrain at this
time from ſeeing them: And ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
were he and Lady Jane that their
being at Paris ſhould get air, that they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0652401300:52"/>
did not truſt even Johnſton, a couſin of
Mrs. Hewit's, with the ſecret.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances admit of a double inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</note>Other pieces of their conduct will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a double interpretation, ſuch as
their leaving their maid ſervants at
Rheims. It may be ſaid that they left
their maids becauſe they did not chooſe
to make them privy to the ſhameful plot
which they were carrying on: but on the
other hand, upon the ſuppoſition of the
impoſture, would they not have taken
theſe maids as accomplices of the fraud?
If they were accomplices, as the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs
themſelves poſitively affirms, with
reſpect to Iſabel Walker, they certainly
would not leave them at Rheims, when
they could be of ſo much uſe to them at
Paris, were it only to have ſerved as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to the ſuppoſed birth. If they
were not accomplices, then they were
both unſuſpicious teſtimonies in behalf
of the defendant; and if their teſtimony
be true, there is an end of the plaintiff's
plea.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The maids being left at Rheims, ſtrongly againſt the plaintiffs.</note>So that this circumſtance of leaving
the maids, is the moſt unlucky that the
plaintiffs could poſſibly have ſelected; nor
can I really ſee how it is poſſible for them
to extricate themſelves from the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in which it places them.</p>

               <note place="margin">Leaving the maids difficult to be explained.</note>It muſt be owned that we cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for theſe maids being left, but one
undeniable piece of evidence in this cauſe
may ſerve to make us pay little regard to
ſuch circumſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Leaving the man-ſervant a circumſtance much more ſuſpicious.</note>When Sir John and Lady Jane came
to Liege, in their way to Paris, they left
there their man ſervant, who was a
Frenchman. This circumſtance the
plaintiffs inſiſted was ſtrongly ſuſpicious,
becauſe they were leaving this French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
behind them at the very time when
he could be of moſt uſe to them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Though Sir John could give no account of this, it is now by good providence clearly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>When Sir John Stewart was aſked
what was the reaſon of their leaving this
man-ſervant, he could give no account of
it whatever; and we ſhould now have
heard it urged as an undeniable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of guilt, had not the wife of this
man by good providence been alive, and
told that her huſband was preſſed by Sir
John and Lady Jane to go along with
them, and that the reaſon why he did
not go to France, was his having been a
deſerter from that ſervice<note n="*" place="bottom">Def. Pr. p. 489.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Therefore all the other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances might have been explained had they been taken in time.</note>Not one of all the circumſtances is ſo

that had they all been enquired into
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0652401300:54"/>

that the differences inſiſted on, are in

is, that Sir John's <hi>accoucheur</hi> was called

Menager</hi>'s friend was called <hi>Louis Pierre
De la Marre.</hi> This is no more but that
<hi>M. La Marre,</hi> from an affectation of
gentility very common in France, choſe
to put <hi>De</hi> before his ſirname, which
however he uſually dropt in familiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
or in ſubſcribing letters; for his
contract of marriage produced by the

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0652401300:76"/>
of the manner in which he ſigned his
letters. His being called <hi>Louis</hi> as well as
<hi>Pierre,</hi> muſt appear a very frivolous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
for we all know that people
who have two names in this manner,
often ſink one of them. It has been ſaid
too, that Sir John's <hi>La Marre</hi> was a
<hi>Walloon,</hi> whereas <hi>Menager</hi>'s <hi>La Marre</hi>
is a Frenchman. But the anſwer is, that
<hi>Menager</hi>'s <hi>La Marre</hi> was born at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treuil

<hi>Walloon</hi> country, and thence was readily
taken for a <hi>Walloon.</hi> In ſhort the only

OBSERVATIONS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UPON ſeeing in the news papers of
Saturday laſt, that <hi>Conſiderations on
the Douglas Cauſe</hi> were that day publiſhed,
and as I had read the proofs and memorials
on that ſingularly important queſtion, I
immediately ſent for theſe Conſiderations, in
order that I might ſee every thing which
ſhould be publiſhed upon a cauſe which has
now for years ingroſſed the attention of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every perſon in the united kingdom,
as well as in other countries. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of theſe Conſiderations, we are told
that they are compoſed by a perſon, <hi>no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,</hi>
and <hi>diſconnected</hi> with both parties,
whoſe friends are pretty equally divided in
their wiſhes; that it is a queſtion of fact;
and that he had often ſerved on juries, who
are by the laws of Scotland allowed to judge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0652401300:83"/>
in matters of fact. From this preamble, I
imagined that the obſervations of ſuch a perſon
would contain nothing in favour of either
party, but what was founded in the proof;
and that however far the keenneſs of parties
might diſpoſe them to carry their reſpective
arguments, an impartial unconnected jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would conſider facts in their true light,
diveſted of all art and falſe colouring. But
how great was my ſurprize, when inſtead
of this I found in the very next page an
inſinuation, That of the ſeven judges who
gave their opinions for the defender in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
two had been his council and agents,
two appointed his guardians, and a fifth had
ſuch connections with the defender as had
induced him to decline judging in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary
ſteps of the cauſe. The plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this inſinuation is to convey an idea
as if only two of theſe ſeven judges were to
be conſidered as diſconnected with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender:
Whereas, on the other ſide, only
two of the judges which remained, had the
leaſt connection with the purſuers, by
having been of their council. The fact,
however, is, that three of theſe eight judges
had been the purſuers council in the law-ſuits
betwixt duke Hamilton and Mr. Douglas,
and that ſome of them and ſeveral others,
are nearly connected with thoſe who expect
to be heirs of the duke of Douglas, failing
the defender; whereas none of the ſeven jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0652401300:84"/>
who gave their opinions for the defender,
have the moſt diſtant connection with him.</p>
            <p>In the next place, this impartial jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who by the bye, is clearly ſome
hireling employed by the purſuers, (and
who has only aſſumed the title of a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
perſon, that his Conſiderations may
have the greater appearance of impartiality)
goes on to inform, that he begun the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the proofs and memorials with
diffidence; that he believed it an intricate
cauſe from the diviſion among the judges;
and that he was careful leſt he ſhould go
wrong, as ſeven, or perhaps eight of the
judges in Scotland had done; but that great
was his aſtoniſhment on finding the cauſe
perfectly clear againſt the defender. He then
goes on to give his reaſons for being of this
opinion, ſome of the moſt material of which I
ſhall ſhortly touch upon, and ſhew that they
are clearly falſe, and no other than an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the artificial arguments contained
in the plaintiff's memorial.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that Lady Jane before leaving
Aix la Chapelle, in a letter to Mr. Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene,
gave a falſe account of her deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was prudent, if a fraud was
intended, becauſe otherwiſe ſhe might have
been watched. That ſhe declined ſtaying
at Liege, and left Rheims upon the falſe
pretence of want of proper aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0652401300:85"/>
It is not true that ever Lady Jane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
or gave a falſe account of her deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on leaving Aix—for ſome time, it is
perfectly clear ſhe intended to have gone to
Geneva, and there after changed her mind;
when ſhe did ſo, ſhe made no ſecret of the
place of her deſtination, told the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of her acquaintance at Aix that ſhe was
going to Rheims, preſſed Lady Wigton
come and live with her there, and cauſed
to write to a perſon to take a houſe for her.
She mentioned it to her whole acquaintances
at Liege, at which place ſhe could not poſſibly
ſtay, as it is the moſt diſagreeable place in
Germany, and ſhe had by this time given
orders to take a houſe for her at Rheims.
Immediately on her arrival at Rheims,
ſhe wrote to every perſon with whom ſhe
had occaſion to correſpond, and even invited
Lord Crawford to come and viſit them there.
That after ſhe had ſtaid ſome time at
Rheims, ſhe was adviſed to go to Paris,
on account of the unſkilfulneſs of Accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheurs
at Rheims, is alſo clearly in proof,
and not the veſtige of evidence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
ſo that this very ſuſpicious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is falſe from beginning to end.</p>
            <p>This juryman next ſays, that ſo far were
they on leaving Rheims from acquainting
Mr. Mailfer of the motives of their journey
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0652401300:86"/>
to Paris, that they tell him, that the object
of their journey was to make purchaſes.</p>
            <p>It is very extraordinary that a perſon
ſhould tell an abſolute untruth in an affair
of this ſerious nature. Sir John never told
Mr. Mailfer that his buſineſs to Paris was to
make purchaſes, nor does Mr. Mailfer ſay ſo
in any part of the letter to Godfrey; and if
Mailfer had ſaid it, which he does not, it
would have been abſurd from hence to have
argued that the motive of the journey was
concealed, as it is clearly in proof that it
was known to the whole town of Rheims.</p>
            <p>Again it is ſaid, that Lady Jane avoided
giving any detail of what paſt in Paris, and
never was heard to mention any particular
relative to the birth of her ſons; only that
on being preſſed by Lady Stair, ſhe ſaid ſhe
had been delivered within two or three
hours of her arrival at Paris,—but that the
ſcrutiny which has been ſince made, obliges
the defender to give up this account of Lady
Jane's.</p>
            <p>This again is abſolutely falſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to clear evidence. Lady Jane did, in
her own life time, mention all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of her delivery, the time when, the
perſon in whoſe houſe, and the Accoucheur
by whom. The evidence of Lady Jane's
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0652401300:87"/>
having ſaid ſhe was delivered within two or
three hours of her arrival in Paris, is of a very
ſingular nature. The hearſay of a hearſay
from Lady Stair, then almoſt 80 years of
age, and remarkably deaf, ſworn to by her
daughter, Mrs. Primroſe, at the diſtance of
many years; and who, at the time of
giving her oath, is above 60 years of age.
This very witneſs too has, from want of
memory, ſworn ſundry things which are
not true, and clearly diſproved; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this part of her oath is not very much to
be depended upon, and is alſo contradicted
by poſitive teſtimony. It is an abſolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
that the defender is forced out of
this account given by Lady Jane, by the
ſcrutiny ſince made. At the defender's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
when no ſcrutiny had been made, the
time, the place, and every circumſtance of the
birth was mentioned, in the ſame manner as
at preſent. If Mrs. Hewit had ſaid at the
ſervice, that Lady Jane had been brought
to bed in three hours after her arrival at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;
and it had now been inſiſted, it was
ſix days after, what this impartial Scotch
jury-man ſays, would have been true; but as
it is otherwiſe, it is an abſolute falſhood.</p>
            <p>He next ſays, Sir John's examination was
taken in preſence of the Lords, with great
deliberation, and laſted three days; and
yet that the defender wants to reject it as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0652401300:88"/>
falſe in every article; and to ſubſtitute ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
La Marre, in place of Sir John's La
Marre, with the aid of one Mr. Menager,
who depoſes to a delivery performed by La
Marre; but which cannot be that of Lady
Jane, as it happened in the year 1746.</p>
            <p>This is as unfair as any of his former
obſervations. The defender never has, ſo
far as I can obſerve from his memorial, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
any one part of Sir John's declaration
as falſe; he has owned, that from his great
age, then 74 years, and ſickly ſtate,
having been raiſed out of bed to attend the
court of ſeſſion, he had fallen into ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
miſtakes, in anſwering queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as to facts, which happened ſixteen
years before. I ſee it is aſſerted, and not
denied, that he behaved on that occaſion,
with uncommon eaſe and unconcern, which
would have been impoſſible if he had been
guilty of the crime this Jury-man ſuppoſes;
and ſo far as I can obſerve from the printed
ſpeeches of the judges, none of them have
inſinuated, that he did not behave on that
occaſion, in the moſt proper manner. As
to the delivery mentioned by Mr. Menager,
having happened in the year 1746, this is
clearly not true, as there is the moſt unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
evidence of its having happened ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
to La Marre's marriage, which was
in the 1747, and in ſummer 1748, when he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0652401300:89"/>
gave out Sholto to be nurſed upon the milk
of a woman near Paris, whoſe child was
born in March 1748.</p>
            <p>It is next ſaid, that the only time Sir
John mentioned real perſons, was in a note
to Mrs. Napier, in the year 1756, when
he mentioned Michelle's as the place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
imagining that that family would,
by that time, at the diſtance of 8 years,
have been dead; but finding that they had
been found out, he ſhifted the ſcene, and
placed it in the houſe of the ideal Madame
Le Brun, who was then mentioned for the
firſt time.</p>
            <p>This too is as untrue as any of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
obſervations. Sir John mentioned one
landlady in place of another, by mere unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
miſtake. La Brun's had been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Lady Jane's life time, as the place
of her delivery, ſo that it was not on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle
family being found out, and denying
that the delivery happened in their houſe that
ſhe was firſt mentioned. And the reſult of
the enquiries by Principal Gordon, never was
communicated to Sir John, conſequently he
could not vary the place, on being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of that enquiry.</p>
            <p>He next ſays, that if a Scotch Lady of
quality had been really delivered of twins
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0652401300:90"/>
in the houſe of Le Brun, and by a La Marre,
their whole friends, acquaintances, and
neighbours, would have heard of it; and
that every perſon in whoſe houſe they ever
lodged abroad, remember them; and that
every other perſon, except La Marre, and Le
Brun, theſe precious people, as they are
called, have been found.</p>
            <p>To this it is, in the firſt place, to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed,
that the only title Lady Jane took,
either at Paris or at Rheims, was that of
Madame Stewart, and that the wife of the
meaneſt perſon in France is called Madame;
ſuch as the noted Madame Mignion, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Sanry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are common beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars;
ſo that her being a lady of quality
was not ſo much as known, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of a lady of twins was ſurely no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
affair. And it is not true, that
every perſon with whom they lodged, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Le Brun, has been found. The land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies
at Sedan are not found out. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in whoſe houſe they lived after leaving
Godefroi's, and before entering to Michelle's,
has not been found out; and the nurſe
brought to Michelle's, as well as Sir John's
ſervant Quibil, one of Godefroi's ſervants,
and ſeveral perſons of this very name of Le
Brun, who at that time had houſes in Paris,
are not found out; all of whom are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0652401300:91"/>
to have exiſted: and there is the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
evidence poſſible of La Mar's exiſtence,
and of his death; of his having brought
Lady Jane to bed, and told it to ſundry of
his acquaintances.</p>
            <p>The Juryman then ſays, that they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at Godefroi's on the 4th, where they
are proved by his books and oath to have
remained till the 14th; he does not ſay
where they were from the 14th to the 18th,
when he ſays they arrived at Michelle's;
that therefore Lady Jane could not have
been delivered on the 10th of July in Le
Brun's; and Mrs. Hewit has been guilty of
wilful perjury in ſaying Lady Jane remained
in childbed nine days. And this being the
caſe, what credit, ſays he, can be given to
any thing ſhe or Sir John can ſay?</p>
            <p>I have conſidered the evidence of this
man Godefroi, and of his books, with as
much attention, and with much leſs partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
than this Juryman; and I confeſs I
never ſaw ſuch a burleſque upon evidence.
An inn-keeper ſwearing at the diſtance of
eighteen years to the particular days of the
week and month when a perſon or company
entered to his houſe, what rooms they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied,
and how many days they ſtaid, is
ſuch a memory as never was heard of before.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0652401300:92"/>
There are no ſuch perſons as Lady Jane and
Sir John in his whole books in July 1748,
ſo that the books can never be of the leaſt
avail. There are indeed ſome arguments in
the purſuers memorial, to ſhew that a blank
account in this man's book muſt apply to
Sir John; but this appears to me abſolutely
chimerical: ſo it is unneceſſary, and indeed
I have not time, to anſwer them.—It is not
true, nor indeed is there the ſhadow of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that they arrived at Michelle's on
the 18th, or ſooner than the 19th at night,
or 20th July. But as the purſuers in their
memorial have ſaid ſo, this impartial, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted,
and judicious Juryman, takes it
for granted, though contrary to the cleareſt
evidence, if he had taken the trouble to
look at it.</p>
            <p>He next goes on to mention the enleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a child from one Mignion, and
ſays, that when he was given away, <hi>his
mother inſiſted upon leaving her own ſwadling-cloaths,
of a coarſe kind of blanket</hi>; <hi>and
this coarſe blanket</hi> was found on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
when he was given to Favre; ſo
that he muſt be Mignion's child.</p>
            <p>It is amazing what lengths party or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
will carry a perſon to, in queſtions
which deſerve the moſt unbiaſſed conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0652401300:93"/>
Madame Mignion, perjured as ſhe
is admitted to be, in favour of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers,
does not even ſay that the bit of dreſs
left with her child was of blanket; and as
little does Favre ſay, that what ſhe deſcribes
as molton or blanketing was a bit inferior
to the other parts of the defender's dreſs.
There never were two children ſeen whoſe
deſcriptions agree leſs with each other, than
that of Mignion's child and the defender,
in dreſs, colour, ſtrength, eyes, and every
thing elſe.</p>
            <p>From page 33. to page 43. this Juryman
accuſes Lady Jane of falſhood, of flattery,
of duplicity, and I know not what, for no
other reaſon, than that ſhe, in one of her
letters, commends two young gentlemen
ſhe met with at the Hague;—that ſhe is in
a paſſion with one of her relations for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhe is living at Windſor, under a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
name, with Col. Stewart; and that
ſhe denied her marriage to Lady Catharine
Wemyſs, at a time ſhe was keeping it a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
from all the world.</p>
            <p>If a perſon of her high rank, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
good character for religion, good ſenſe,
and other amiable accompliſhments, is to
be abuſed in the manner this hireling (for
he can be nothing elſe) has done Lady Jane,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0652401300:94"/>
for ſuch reaſons as theſe, it is certain no
woman on earth can poſſibly eſcape falling
a ſacrifice to the ſpite of ſuch illiberal, bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
people. It is very true, that if ſhe
was now alive, ſhe would probably think
differently of ſome of thoſe young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
of whom ſhe had then ſo good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
From her own letter, ſhe had much
reaſon to be diſſatisfied at the perſon ſhe is
angry with for many falſhoods ſhe had
raiſed to her prejudice; and her denying
her marriage does not, in her circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
appear to me at all culpable. If people
are to judge of one's character from their
writings, the author of theſe Conſiderations,
if he is as diſintereſted in this ſuit as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
is ſurely a very bad hearted man:
for, at the very time he is employed in
writing theſe Conſiderations, he muſt have
been ſenſible he was ſaying many things
which are abſolutely falſe, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to prejudice the world againſt a young
man who never offended him.</p>
            <p>He next ſays that Sholto was left ſixteen
months at Paris, under the care of La
Marre, and that if he had died in the mean
time, no perſon knew where the child was,
ſo he muſt have been loſt.</p>
            <p>Sir John knew well at the time where
the child was at nurſe, he had ſeen him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0652401300:95"/>
when at Paris. He had viſited him
from Damartine; he had wrote to Lady Jane
an account of his health from Paris to that
place, as appears from Mrs. Hewit's letter
to the maids. He returned to Paris in Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober
1748, and carried cloaths with him
for the child; he went back again in the
Spring 1749, for no other purpoſe but to
ſee the child. How then can this man ſay
that if La Marre had died the child would
have been loſt? The only reaſon he has is,
that Sir John ſays, when examined, in the
year 1762, in the 74th year of his age, that
he did not then remember the place where
ſhe had lived in the year 1748.</p>
            <p>The Juryman then goes on to ſtate, that
when Sir John and Lady Jane were about to
return to Britain, they went from Rheims
to Paris, under the pretence of bringing away
their ſecond child, that during the eight days
they were then at Paris, a child of one Sanry
was carried off from his father, by one
Duverné, who was aged about ſixty, and
that this Duverné was no other than Sir
John Stewart, and the child Sholto.</p>
            <p>As to this charge, without entering much
into the particulars, it is as clear as ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
that the child of Sanry and Sholto
were different. The proof of the exiſtence
of Sholto from his birth in July 1748,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0652401300:96"/>
is to me convincing, Sanry's child was four
months older than the defender; yet Sholto
was much leſs and weaker than his brother,
as had been uniformly given out. Sanry's
child was walking and ſpeaking when car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off, and yet the evidence is clear that
Sholto did neither when brought to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and for ſome time after: and every
one of the purſuers witneſſes ſay, that appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
was made to the lieutenant of police
to make a ſearch for the perſons who carried
off this child, within two or three days after
he was taken away from his parents; and
there is the moſt ſatisfying evidence that
this magiſtrate was not applied to till the
10th of January 1750, ſeveral weeks before
which time Sir John had left Rheims, on
his return to England, with both his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
ſo that he could not poſſibly have had
the leaſt connection with this pretended en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levement.</p>
            <p>His arguments upon the ſuppoſed
impoſſibility of their not writing to Paris,
when they heard of the ſuſpicions as to
the legitimacy of their children, their
writing to Aix for certificates of the preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
&amp;c. are not worth minding, they
are trivial and totally immaterial: only it is
very clearly proved, that they took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of a gentleman very eminent in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
then a lawyer, if they ought to do
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0652401300:97"/>
ſo, and were aſſured it was highly unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and improper; and had they, upon
falſe reports raiſed in the manner theſe have
been proved to have been, given themſelves
the trouble of obtaining certificates, they
would rather have increaſed than diminiſhed
the ſuſpicions.</p>
            <p>What he has ſaid as to Godefroi is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
noticed, and it is needleſs to take
more time upon it at preſent.</p>
            <p>His obſervations upon Lady Jane's preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
are puerile and trifling to the higheſt
degree. If ever woman on earth was with
child during the whole nine months prior to
the birth, Lady Jane Douglas was. Her
appearance of pregnancy was not ſudden,
as alledged by this author, but gradual;
obſerved by her ſervants and the people
about her from the firſt hour, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
gradually increaſing till ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of the defender and his twin brother.
The ſuppoſal of her appearance of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
being ſtronger at Aix than at Rheims
is ridiculous, when it is ſuppoſed ſhe was
at this very time deceiving onè of her own
maid ſervants who was about her at both
theſe places.</p>
            <p>This author concludes with an idle and
unneceſſary account of the popularity of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0652401300:98"/>
the defender and his cauſe in Scotland; that
the whole country were incenſed at the
judgment; but that the judicious and moſt
valuable part of ſociety, though perhaps the
leaſt numerous, applauded the deciſion.</p>
            <p>The purpoſe of this declamation I do not
ſee; nor did I ever hear who the valuable
part of ſociety alluded to are, unleſs they
be the tutors of Duke Hamilton,—the heirs
of line of the Duke of Douglas, and their
friends, and ſome of the authors of the
ſcandalous reports which were falſely raiſed
againſt Lady Jane.</p>
            <p>This gentleman however is pleaſed to ſay
that every humane heart muſt compaſſionate
the defender; and that he applauds his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs,
by whom, I ſuppoſe, he means
the Ducheſs of Douglas, for her unwearied
ſupport of him.</p>
            <p>Whether this gentleman is one of theſe
humane hearted people will appear from his
pamphlet. The defender, I am perſuaded,
deſpiſes his pity as much as his pamphlet,
and as much as the Ducheſs of Douglas, if I
am not much miſtaken of her character, does
his praiſes. She has done what ſhe thought
her duty, and what ſhe owed to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of Douglas in ſupporting it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
a young man of uncommon merit,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0652401300:99"/>
againſt a very extraordinary combination of
the moſt relentleſs, implacable and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enemies. Neither ſhe or her pupil
have the leaſt reaſon to doubt of obtaining
that juſtice in another country which they
have been refuſed in their own.</p>
