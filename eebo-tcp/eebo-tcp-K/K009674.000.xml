            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN Men miſtake in one Thing,
'tis very uſual to have the World
think they miſtake in every Thing;
and 'tis an eaſy thing to find a
Stone to throw at a Dog.</p>
            <p>Had the poor <hi>Weavers,</hi> who I am now to
ſpeak of, brought their Complaints againſt the
exorbitant Wearing of <hi>Callicoes</hi> in a regular
and juſtifiable Manner, and before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Judges of thoſe Things; as their Conduct
could not have been reproach'd, ſo the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
which now ſuffers by their miſtake,
would, perhaps, have met with more Friends.</p>
            <p>But wiſe and impartial Men will learn to
diſtinguiſh between the Juſtice of a Cauſe, and
the Miſtakes of the Managers of it; between
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0249600800:3"/>
the Reaſon of the Complaint, and the diſor derly
manner of Complaining: And this is all we ſhall
have occaſion to ſay of the poor miſtaken tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<hi>Weavers,</hi> leaving them to the Clemency
and Compaſſion of the Government, whom they
have offended, but recommending the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
under which they groan, to the ſerious
Conſideration of thoſe in whoſe Power it is to
redreſs it.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Weavers</hi> ſuffer under the general
Calamity of Trade; that they, and even the
whole Manufacturing part of the Nation, are
oppreſs'd by the exorbitant growth of clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
Trade, and the unreaſonable pouring in
of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Wrought Goods upon us. This
will admit of no Debate, at leaſt, none that
can be ſupported by Reaſon: What little can be
ſaid for it is ſo eaſily confuted and expos'd, and
has ſo often been fully anſwer'd, that little
will be wanting now: But according to my Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
to ſtate the Caſe clearly and impartially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Woollen and Silk Goods made at Home,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0249600800:4"/>
and the Callicoes and Wrought Silks printed
here, or clandeſtinely imported from Abroad.</p>
            <p>In order to enter upon this Affair with all
poſſible Clearneſs and Plainneſs, and, if we can,
to ſtrike at the Root of the Miſchiefs we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of, I ſhall firſt lay down ſome general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
as Fundamentals in this Queſtion of
Trade, obliging my ſelf to give ſuch Evidence
for the proof of them, as ſhall take away all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Pretences to deny the Fact; and this I do
at firſt, that we may have no ſtum bling at the
Threſhold, no cavelling at the Terms, or ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
off the Queſtion from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but that as I may talk to Men of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I may talk likewiſe to their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Conviction. My Propoſitions are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Woollen and Silk Manufactures
of this Kingdom being the Staple of our
Trade, and the moſt conſiderable and aſſential
part of our Wealth, the Fund for our Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the Support of our Navigation, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0249600800:5"/>
the only Means we have for the Employing
and Sunſiſting our Poor; it is therefore the
common Intereſt of the whole Kingdom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
every other Manufacture, whether
foreign or aſſum'd, ſo far as thoſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
are ruinous to, and inconſiſtent with
the Proſperity of the ſaid <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures
of Wool and Silk.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Wearing and Uſing Printed or
Painted Callicoes, as they are now almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
worn and uſed in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is
ruinous to, and inconſiſtent with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures, as well
thoſe of Wool as thoſe of Silk.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the total prohibiting the Wearing
and uſing of Printed and Painted Callicoes in
<hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is not ruinous to, or inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the Proſperity of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi>
Trade; or, <hi>to put it into an Affirmative that
may be more capable of Evidence,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Trade may and would remain in a very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0249600800:6"/>
thriving and flouriſhing Condition, and be
carry'd on to the Profit and Advantage of the
Adventurers, tho all the Subjects of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
and of <hi>Ireland</hi> were effectually limitted
from, and prohibited the wearing and uſing of
Printed and Painted Callicoes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Printed and Painted Callicoes
now worn and uſed in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
four Denominaitons, <hi>ALL pernicious and
deſtructive</hi> to our Trade, (<hi>viz.</hi>) ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inported by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> are either printed
in the <hi>Indies</hi> or in <hi>Holland,</hi> and clandeſtinely
run on Shoar here, in ſpite of former Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions:
<hi>OR</hi> ſuch as being imported here by
our own <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and prohibited
to be worn becauſe printed in <hi>India,</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be exported, but are privately run
on Shoar again and ſold: <hi>OR</hi> ſuch as being
printed here, are entered and ſhip'd for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portatian,
in order to dram back the Duties
on the Stamps but are re landed and ſold
here; and laſtly, ſuch as are Printed here,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0249600800:7"/>
and legally worn and uſed, and under the
<hi>Colour of which ALL</hi> the other Frauds are
practis d and conceal'd.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That this clandeſtine Importation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landing
of Printed and Painted Callicoes, is
no way to be prevented, neither is it in the
reach of the Wit and Power of Man to put a
ſtop to it by any other Means but by effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
preventing and prohibiting the wearing,
and uſe of them.</p>
            <p>I have ſome other eſſential Propoſitions in
Trade, which will come in courſe to be laid
down for the carrying on this Argument, as
we proceed in the Conſideration of theſe; but
I ſhall reſerve them <hi>in petto</hi> till I ſee whether
the Age is weak enough to ſtruggle with things
ſo ſelfevident as theſe, and till I ſee what it
is can be offer'd, <hi>if any thing ſhall be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
up,</hi> againſt theſe five.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the IMPORTATION of
Wrought Silks and Printed Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licoes
from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and
allowing the uſe of them here
when imported, has all along been found
prejudicial to the Home Conſumption of our
Woollen and Silk Manufactures in <hi>Great-Britan,</hi>
needs no other Proof than the late
Acts of Parliament, which were obtain'd in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0249600800:9"/>
Conſequence of the general Application of
the <hi>Manufacturers,</hi> as well Maſters as Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
through the whole Kingdom, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
and limit their Conſumption.</p>
            <p>In doing this, the Parliament, whoſe
Wiſdom and Juſtice was very conſpicuous
in that very Caſe, entred into the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Cauſe, ſearch'd it to the bottom,
and weigh'd the Allegations on every ſide.
The Members were neither clamour'd into
it by the <hi>Weavers,</hi> byafs'd to it by Parties,
or hurry'd into it by the multitude of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
from the Counties and Corporations
they repreſented; but the Weight of the
Cauſe ſupported it ſelf; the Nature of the
Thing pleaded it, and their own well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh'd
Reaſon importun'd them to it: The
thing was ſelf-evident; the Humor of the
People, <hi>as too often is the Fate of Nations,</hi>
ſeem'd, at that time, poſſeſs'd againſt their
Intereſt, and being hurry'd down the Stream
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0249600800:10"/>
of their Fancy, they ran headlong into the
greateſt Neglect and Contempt of the
Growth and Manufactures of their own
Country and People, and embrac'd, with
a Violence in their Temper not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
the Silks and Callicoes of <hi>India,</hi> in
a manner even ridiculous to themſelves, as
well as fatal to their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>The Extravagance of that Time cannot
be ſo entirely forgot, as that we ſhould not
reflect how the Ladies converted their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
and Quilts into Gowns and Petticoats,
and made the broad and uncouth Bordures
of the former ſerve inſtead of the rich La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Embroideries they were uſed to
wear, and dreſs more like the Merry-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews
of <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair, than like the
Ladies and Wives of a Trading People.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence was, what any one
might thave foreſeen would be, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the
Ruin of our Manufactures, the ſtagnating
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0249600800:11"/>
of our Trade, the ſtop of Employment, and
the ſtarving our Poor: The Cry was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,
not the <hi>Spittle-Fields</hi> Weavers only,
ſelt it; the Calamity was general, and the
Complaint came from every Corner of the
Nation.</p>
            <p>As all Miſchiefs in their Exorbitance tend
naturally to their own Cure, ſo it was hear;
ſeeing the thing was fatal in it ſelf to our
Trade, it was our Felicity that it run on to
ſuch Extremes as allarm'd the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
for this awaken'd the Parliament to
its Redreſs; Such we cannot but hope will
be the Caſe again; for like Cauſes generally
produce like Effects.</p>
            <p>The Proceedings of the Legiſlature might
paſs with us all, for Reaſon, in a Caſe of
much more Conſequence than this; but we
have yet more powerful Auxiliaries to bring
in Aid of the Caſe before us; I'll inſiſt
upon two only, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> The Pattern of our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0249600800:12"/>
Neighbours; 2<hi>dly,</hi> The Succeſs of our own
Prohibitions. I begin with the laſt.</p>
            <p>What the Parliament did in the Cafe I
juſt now mentioned, was abundantly juſtify'd
in the Succeſs: What can be more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
to apply the ſame way, ſeeing the
Cafe is the ſame?</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the Flux of foreign Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
ſtopp'd and the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods
prohibited, but the Trade reviv'd; the Face
of Things chang'd; Buſineſs and Plenty
ſucceeded to want of Employment, and
want of Bread; the Numbers of Poor flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Manufactures for Employment,
and the Encreaſe of the Conſumption of
our Manufactures reviv'd the whole Nation.
Nothing could be a ſtronger and more
convincing Evidence of what had been
alledg'd, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the ſo general wearing
and uſing <hi>Eaſt. India</hi> printed Callicoes, &amp;c.
had been the Ruin of our Trade, had put a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0249600800:13"/>
ſtop to the Employment of the Weavers,
and, in a word, had <hi>ſtarv'd our Poor.</hi> I
ſhall come to this again in its Place.</p>
            <p>I come, in the next place, to the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our Neighbours, and particularly
the <hi>French,</hi> a Nation but too wife in the
moſt proper Methods for erecting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Manufactures; of which there
are ſuch Teſtimonies given in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> who was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call'd, <hi>The Father of the</hi> French <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,</hi>
as we have felt the Conſequences
of in Trade for many Years paſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French East-India</hi> Company was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd
by the enterpriſing <hi>Genius</hi> of the
ſaid Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> in the Year 1664, and
the Edict paſs'd the <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>th of <hi>August</hi> 1686,
ſettling all their Privileges for 50 Years;
and they begun with great Advantages, tho'
they had not Succeſs, occaſioned by their
own Miſmanagement: However, the King
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0249600800:14"/>
of <hi>France,</hi> finding the uſing and wearing
of <hi>India</hi> wrought Silks, Cottons, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licoes
painted and printed, whether in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
or at Home, began to encroach upon
the Manufactures of his Subjects, as well
Silk as Wool; and fore-ſeeing that it would
be the Ruin of both, for which he thought
himſelf oblig'd to preſerve the utmoſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
as being the Fundamental of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of his Kingdom, he effectually prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the Wearing and Uſe of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
printed at Home or Abroad, among his
Subjects, by an Edict in the Year 1686,
and under very ſevere Penalties: And the
late King of <hi>France,</hi> being mov'd by his
Council of Trade, from time to time, by
ſeveral ſubſequent Edicts, confirm'd thoſe
Prohibitions, adding farther Penalties, more
ſevere than before, for enforcing the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:
By all which it appears, of what
Conſequence this Matter was thought to be
for the preſerving the Manufactures of his
own Dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0249600800:15"/>
The Government of <hi>France</hi> proceeding
ſtill upon the ſame Maxims, of a juſt Policy
in Trade, continue as Tenacious of their
former Care for their own Manufactures as
ever: And this appears by the Proviſion
made by ſubſequent Edicts to continue the
ſame Prohibitions, in the ſtricteſt manner,
of all ſuch <hi>East-India</hi> Goods as are hurtful

is a flaming Inſtance: (<hi>viz.</hi>) We all
know, that the preſent Government has u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
their old <hi>East-India</hi> Company to their
new <hi>West-India</hi> Company; and what great
Advances of Credit that Union has made in
<hi>France</hi>; yet, ſo far is the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from neglecting their own Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
by forgetting to prohibit the Uſe of
the Callicoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the ſaid Company
may import; and ſo far are they from ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that the ſaid Company ſhould not
flouriſh and thrive, notwithſtanding the
Prohibition of thoſe Goods, tho' ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a Branch of their Importation, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0249600800:16"/>
thoſe Prohibitions are all expreſly renew'd,
repeated and confirm'd, by the Edict of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union,
as appears by the IXth and Xth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Grant to the ſaid new Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
Company, as follows:</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here we ſee the very Thing done in <hi>France</hi>
which we want here; and for the very ſame
Reaſons for which we ſtand ſo much in need
of it here; which Reaſons we cannot doubt
will ſubſiſt with the ſame Force here as there;
the Foundations of Foreign Import, &amp; Home
Manufactures, being the ſame, and eſpecially,
becauſe he cannot doubt, but that a <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Parliament will appear inſpir'd with all the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0249600800:18"/>
juſt Principles of Care and Concern for the
Good of our People, and the Proſperity of
our Trade, as the Councils of the late King
of <hi>France</hi> could be for his Subjects.</p>
            <p>But I cannot forbear taking Notice here,
how much ſtronger the Argument is on our
Side for the doing this now, than it ever
was before, even for this particular Reaſon,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) Becauſe the <hi>French</hi> have, upon their
new Eſtabliſhment, continued their Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions.
I explain my ſelf thus:</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> have not only re-eſtabliſh'd
the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> but they have put it into
Hands which are not like to neglect it, run
in Debt in the <hi>Indies</hi>; or ſell the Liberty
of Trade to others; but they who are now
entruſted with the Privilege, know very
well how to make uſe of it, and want no
Stock to carry it on: And as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
both in Knowledge of the Buſineſs, and
Stock for the managing of it, ſo they appear
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0249600800:19"/>
reſolute to proceed immediately upon it, and
we are told, they have already taken up four
large Ships for the carrying on the Trade,
and that they talk of taking up ſeveral more.
The <hi>Flemmings</hi> under the Inperial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
or Charter, are not only doing the
ſame, but are actually embark'd in the <hi>East-India</hi>
Trade, have ſeveral Ships now Abroad
and one great Ship juſt arriv'd from <hi>India</hi> at
<hi>Oſtend,</hi> being the ſecond that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſince their entring upon that Trade:
And we are likewiſe told, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Auſtrian Netherlands</hi> has already
reſolv'd on the prohibiting the Conſumption
of Printed &amp; Painted Callicoes among them;
and that they will be publickly prohibited
there as they are in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let any impartial Perſon then judge,
whether we have not juſt Reaſon to be
allarm'd at theſe Meaſures, while we lie
open to a ſmuggling Trade ſo generally
carried on thro' this whole Kingdom, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0249600800:20"/>
ſo impoſſible now to be prevented: Whither
muſt the vaſt Quantities of Callicoes which
theſs two new <hi>East-India</hi> Companies will
import, I ſay, Whither muſt they go?
Whither but to <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> where the People are ſo fond of
them, and where it is ſo eaſy to get them
on Shore.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company has already
ſhew'd themſelves apprehenſive of Succeſs
of the new Eſtabliſh'd Imperial Company in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> nor can they be juſtly unconcern'd
at the ſetting up a Company in <hi>France,</hi>
upon ſo potent a Stock as that of 50 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions:
But what then have we not to fear
for our Woollen and Silk Manufactures,
which are ſo oppreſs'd already with clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
Importations of Silks and Callicoes
from Abroad, as well as Printing them at
Home, and when the <hi>French</hi> will not fail
to bring in Quantities equal to the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
which they have to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0249600800:21"/>
We may appeal for this, to any one that
is acquainted on thoſe Shores of <hi>England</hi>
which lie neareſt to <hi>France</hi>; are not <hi>French</hi>
Brandies, <hi>French</hi> Wines, and <hi>French</hi> Silks to
be had almoſt in as great Plenty in our Port-Towns
on that ſide of the Country, as in
ſome Parts of <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, and will it not
be the ſame thing with <hi>India</hi> Goods? Can
<hi>Rumney Marſh</hi> want <hi>French</hi> Callicoes, where
all <hi>French</hi> Goods are, <hi>as it were,</hi> as familiar
to them as in <hi>France?</hi> Can thoſe People
that know how to carry off whole Freights
of Wool, the moſt bulky of all Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
be ignorant to take on Shoar <hi>French</hi>
Callicoes, <hi>French</hi> Wrought Silks, <hi>French
Eaſt-India</hi> Goods of all Kinds? It cannot be
doubted, but when the <hi>French</hi> come to have
a Quantity of Callicoes always by them, and
no conſumption for them at Home, they will
find Ways and Means to croud them in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, with much more Eaſe than they do
now their Wines and Brandies. What the
Conſequence of this will be to our Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0249600800:22"/>
and Silk Manufactures, is very plain:
They muſt be deſtroy'd nothing can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things ſerve to let us ſee, that the
preſent Debate is not the Concern of a few
People in <hi>Spittle-Fields</hi> only, tho' their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and Diſtreſs happens to be neareſt our
View at this time, as their Complaints have
been loudeſt: But, in a word, the whole
Body is effected, the whole Intereſt of our
Woollen and Silk Manufactures throughout
the Kingdom is concern'd in it; I mean, as
to thoſe Goods which concern our Wearing
Apparel and Furniture, which is the Bulk
of our Manufactures; nay, the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company themſelves are concern'd in it;
and, I believe, it might be very eaſy to
prove, by a juſt Calculation, that if theſe
Companies now ſet up in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
proſper and thrive, as it is more than
probable they will, the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company
of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will ſuffer more by their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0249600800:23"/>
Importing their Callicoes here, and thereby
ſharing the Trade with them, or rather
taking it from them, then they will, by the
general putting a ſtop upon the Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and thereby checking the Foreigners
in their beginning; ſo that upon the whole
of the two, the Prohibition ſeems to me
to be no Evil at all, but, rather an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to them.</p>
            <p>It was, without queſtion, an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Miſtake in thoſe who ſollicited the firſt
Prohibition of <hi>India</hi> printed Callicoes, that
they contented themſelves with prohibiting
the Uſe of Callicoes printed Abroad, but
did not inſiſt upon prohibiting the Wearing
and Uſe of thoſe printed at Home, as Things
in themſelves equally ruinous to our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures;
they had not then left the Door
open to the Printing and Painting them in
<hi>England,</hi> a Trade then ſcarce known; under
colour of which, all ſorts of Callicoes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
printed, have been worn here, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0249600800:24"/>
Foreigners thereby encouraged to pour them
in upon us by the Arts of clandeſtine Trade,
and our People impoſe upon us by re-landing
their own; in which, by the way, the known
and wilful Perjury that attends it, is one of
the leaſt Things in our Conſideration.</p>
            <p>But now the Work is to be done over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
with this Difficulty in the Difference,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) that now we have the Pretences of
the <hi>Callicoe Printers</hi> to ſtruggle with, their
calling the Callicoes a Manufacture, becauſe
Painted and Printed here; tho' theſe are in
themſelves meer Trifles, like that of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Families employ'd in Printing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
I ſay, Trifles, when compar'd with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
themſelves which we plead for,
and the Numbers of Families and People
maintain'd by, and employ'd in them; of
which I believe I am not arrogant, when I
ſay, it is ridiculous to talk of any Proportion.</p>
            <p>The Work has alſo another Difficulty in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0249600800:25"/>
its way, or rather a pretended Difficulty;
that is to ſay, I foreſee that ſome People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to call this a Difficulty, I mean, the
Fund form'd upon the Stamps on Callicoes,
appropriated, perhaps, to ſuch or ſuch Uſes,
or as Security for ſuch and ſuch Loans:
But as all thoſe Funds are, to our great
Satisfaction, made redeemable by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we have no more to do but to convince
our Repreſentatives of the Neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
them, and leave the Houſe, which
is the in exhauſtible Fund of Funds, to their
own Methods for finding an equivalent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to the Satisfaction of the Lenders;
and yet, even in this Point, when the Houſe
ſhall legitimate ſuch an Attempt, ſomething
may be ſaid farther.</p>
            <p>Difficulties therefore are no Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where abſolute Necceſſity is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
The Thing carries an apparent Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
in it; it muſt be remedied, or our Trade
muſt be Ruin'd, our Manufactures be at an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0249600800:26"/>
End, and our poor not ſent a Begging on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but indeed be Starv'd. And here,
were it any thing to the Purpoſe, I could
ſpend ſome time in Exclamation, at the
prepoſterous unthinking Humour of our
People, who, upon all Occaſions, run di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
counter to their Intereſt, as a Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nation, in ſo viſible and ſo evident a
manner as this of wearing Printed Callicoes;
or, at leaſt, wearing them ſo as to make it an
univerſal Mode. We often ſee Clothiers,
Drugget-Makers, Sergemakers, Stuff-makers
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> dreſs themſelves and their Families
in the Cloth, or Druggets, or Serges, or
Stuffs they make; and tho' they may not
be ſo very like their Neighbours, they will
give this ready Anſwer, (<hi>viz.</hi>) '<hi>Tis my
own Trade; 'tis my own Manufacture.</hi> And
the Anſwer is allow'd to be very rerſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
Why ſhould it not be a National An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
as well as a Family Anſwer? Why
ſhould not an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, or an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Lady, reject foreign and deſtructive <hi>Gew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaws,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0249600800:27"/>
and chuſing to wear the Woollen and
Silk of our own Product and Manufacture,
give this for a Reaſon for it, <hi>Tis our own
Trade; 'tis our own Manufacture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us go to the <hi>Indians</hi> and the <hi>Chineſes</hi>
for Inſtruction, as <hi>Solamon</hi> ſends the Sluggard
to the Ant: Are they prevaild with to lay
by their own Manufactures for any of Ours?
No; 'tis evident, we are ſo far from being
able to place any of our Manufactures among
them, that they deſpiſe the Propoſal; and
refuſe to ſell thoſe Goods, which we have
<hi>ſo little need of,</hi> but for that ready Money,
which we have <hi>ſo little need to part with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is a large Field; I refer it to the
Time when the Battle ſhall be more cloſely
join'd; then we may find time to talk more
feelingly of the Folly of carrying Money to
the <hi>Indies,</hi> to buy that, which we ought
rather to give Money to be without.</p>
            <p>But I return to the <hi>Indians,</hi> who, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0249600800:28"/>
as they may be to judge of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Intereſts, are yet wiſer in this part, by
the Strength of meer Nature, than we are,
who pretend to ſo much Knowledge; for
they wear their own Manufactures; not can
we bring them to alter the manner of their
Cloathing, any more than the Matter of it.</p>
            <p>Some have alledg'd for a Reaſon of this,
the Climate in the <hi>Indies</hi> being ſuited to the
Manufactures they make; and that nothing
can be ſo light, ſo clean, ſo pleaſant in ſuch
hot Countries, as the Callicoes and Silks of
their own making: But we might very well
anſwer this, by giving the Patterns of
our fine Stuffs; ſome of which, as well as
the manner of wearing them in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
are much Cooler, and much more
ſuited to the Heat of the warmeſt Climate,
than the uncouth Faſſions, great Sleeves
and pleated Gowns of the <hi>Indians</hi> who even
load themſelves, rather than dreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with their Callicoes and other Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0249600800:29"/>
of their own Make. Any Traveller
might be left to judge of this, who has ſeen
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Peru,</hi> at <hi>Lima,</hi> at <hi>Panama
Carthagena,</hi> and ſuch-like hot Places, where
they dreſs much cooler and lighter in <hi>Britiſh</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> Stuffs and Cloth, nay, even in
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Black Bayes, than the <hi>Indians</hi> on the
Coaſt of <hi>Malabar</hi> and <hi>Coromandel,</hi> or in the
Bay of <hi>Bengale,</hi> do in their Silks and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licoes;
but Nature dictates to theſe Nations
to cultivate their own Produce, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
their own Manufacture, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
their own Commerce: And Nature
would dictate the ſame thing to us, if we did
not obſtinately put out Nature's Eyes, and
act againſt Nature, in the purſuit of the
moſt untractable part of our Faculties, I
mean, Humour and Fancy.</p>
            <p>Certainly, if we were free from this Trade-Frenzy,
and were to act by the Dictates of
Common Senſe, we ſhould reflect, that the
Woollen Manufacture is the Staple of our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0249600800:30"/>
ginal Fountain of our Wealth, and, as I ſaid
in my <hi>Introduction,</hi> it is <hi>the moſt eſſential part
of the Riches of the Rich, and the principal
Means we have for the employing our Poor.</hi>
Many things might be ſaid to prove, and
ſome to illuſtrate whatever is contain'd in
theſe Generals, concerning our Woollen-Manufacture;
but I am loath to ſuppoſe my
ſelf talking to any People ſo ignorant as not
to know it, or ſo partial as not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it. If I can meet with any <hi>Engliſhman</hi>
ſo weak as to diſpute it, I undertake, at
Demand, to expoſe them, and prove my
Propoſition, both at once.</p>
            <p>The Premiſes then being granted, my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is as juſt, namely, <hi>that it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt of the whole Kingdom to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
every other Manufacture, ſo far as
thoſe Manufactures, ruinous</hi> to, <hi>and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi>
with <hi>the Proſperity of</hi> our Own.</p>
            <p>The late King of <hi>France,</hi> who ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0249600800:31"/>
the Intereſt of his Subjects in Trade,
is a ſtanding Authority for this very thing:
All the Edicts publiſh'd in <hi>France</hi> on this
Subject, ſuch as in the Year 1686, and in
1689, and in 1697, prohibiting the Printing
and Painting of Callicoes in <hi>France,</hi> and the
ſelling Callicoes Printed or Painted in <hi>India</hi>
when Imported into <hi>France,</hi> are fortified
with this Reaſon, as ſufficient to juſtify
their Government in the ſaid Prohibition.
(viz.) <hi>that they were prejudicial to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
of Wooll and Silk, already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſbed
in</hi> France.</p>
            <p>And there are two things in thoſe Edicts
of the King of <hi>France</hi> which are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
and which I reſerve for farther
Explanation, if I find occaſion to ſpeak in
this Cauſe hereaſter; I ſay, two things are
very remarkable in the King of <hi>France</hi>'s
Prohibitions and Limitation of his <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company's Trade, which ſtand as
Precedents for our Practice; the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0249600800:32"/>
being much more ſtrong and forcible at
this time in our Circumſtances, than they
could then be in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That in the Edict or Arret, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
or forbidding the Painting &amp; Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Callicoes in <hi>France,</hi> is alſo included a
ſtrict Prohibition of the Painting and Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any kind of Linen Cloath of Hemp or
Flax, tho' ſuch Linen was the Growth and
Manufacture of his own Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in his Limitation of the
importations of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company,
there is this Clauſe; That whereas the
Company were allow'd to import ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Wrought Silks, named in the Edict, to
the value of 150000 Livers a Year, ſo,
<hi>firſt,</hi> they were oblig'd to bring in no more;
and, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> they were oblig'd, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of that Liberty only, I ſay, they
were obliged to export to the <hi>Indies</hi> the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0249600800:33"/>
value of 500000 Livers a Year in Goods of
the Growth and Manufactures of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And even this Condition did not continue
long; for the Council of Trade there, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the conſumption of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
was by no means an Equivalent
for the Injury thoſe Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' but to
the value of 150000 Livers a Year, did to
the Manufactures of <hi>France,</hi> that Grant was
alſo revok'd and the Goods entirely prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
under the moſt rigorous Penalties,
as they continue to be this Day.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Clauſes are of ſuch moment in
the Caſe before us, and dictate ſo clearly
not only what we have to ſeek, and what
to complain of, with reſpect to our Maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
and to our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company,
but alſo the Reaſons of it, that I cannot
but think it very much for the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to publiſh the ſevral Edicts, in which
theſe Clauſes, and the Reaſon and Cauſes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0249600800:34"/>
given for them are contain'd, accordingly
they are plac'd in the Cloſe of this
Work.</p>
            <p>Thus I have touch'd at the Heads of this
Matter, and have paſs'd them over without
other Enlargments then ſuch as the preſent
Occaſion makes neceſſary. This Eſſay, <hi>for
it is no more,</hi> is but a Specimen of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
every one of theſe Heads having
neceſſary Explanations attending them, and
long debated Points of Commerce to ſpeak
to, in order to ſet the whole Affair in a
clear Light; all which it may be to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to enlarge upon hereaſter.</p>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>In the mean time, I cannot diſmiſs this
Affair, without turning a little to the Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of Mankind, and eſpecially the
Dealers in the Woollen Manufactures in this
Nation: 'Tis not a little ſtrange to obſerve,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0249600800:35"/>
how unconcern'd we ſit, and ſeem to enjoy
our ſelves in a perfect compoſure of Mind,
and a moſt inimitable Tranquility; when our
general Commerce, by which we all ſubſiſt,
languſhes, and, as it were, expires in our
ſight. At Home, foreign Manufactures en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon us; Abroad, they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
new Projects to attack us; and as they
ſeem united to Undo us, ſo, I muſt ſay,
we ſeem unanimous in the Reſolution of
being Undone.</p>
               <p>How can we ſit ſtill and ſee the Bread
thus taken out of our labouring Peoples
Mouths, even by thoſe very Men who ought
to be equally concern'd with us to prevent
it? The Wearing and Uſe of Callicoes, is
evidently the Ruin of our Manufactures:
If we can diſtinguiſh between the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
and the Manufacturers; if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polyment
can be loſt, and the Workmen
not ſuffer; if the Trade can die, and the
Tradeſmen live; then I have no Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0249600800:36"/>
for my Diſcourſe, no Reaſon for this
Expoſtulation.</p>
               <p>Nay, if this was a particular Article of
Trade only, if a few Families were to be
ruin'd of this or that particular Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only, and the main of our People
not be effected with it; we might be ſilent,
and the Oppoſers might ſay, we made more
Noiſe of it than there was occaſion for.</p>
               <p>But ſince the Evil is general, and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
which attend it are ſo ſpreading, that
the whole Nation is more or leſs effected,
from the Gentleman of the greateſt Quality
and Eſtate, to the meaneſt Wool-cumber,
and that we are inevitably to feel the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of it: How can we, I ſay, ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd,
and ſee out Families impoveriſh'd,
and the Foundation laid for the Ruin of our
Poſterity, and yet take no Notice of it? It
is certainly our Concern, in a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner, to APPEAR, not in Arms, not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0249600800:37"/>
in Mobs and Tumults, that neither is a
lawful Way of Appearing, nor would it
give the leaſt Aid in the Matter. Trade
is the Daughter of Peace, and draws its
principal Nouriſhment from the publick
Tranquillity: No Men in their Senſes can
propoſe raiſing Tumults and Riots for the
promoting Trade, neither is it the way to
engage the Government, the Parliament,
or the Miniſtry, to redreſs our Grievances
in Trade. Such violent Ways only arm
Power againſt us, and engage Governors to
be our Enemies. My Arguments all run
another Way, and if I miſtake not, have
ten times more Force in them with wiſe
Governments, than all the Clamours of a
Rabble can ſuppoſe to have.</p>
               <p>I move you firſt to ſee the Miſchief: To
that end, I ſet it in a clear Light, prove
the Fact, ſhew you the ſlow degrees by
which the Poiſon works, how inſenſibly it
grows upon you, and yet how ſenſibly ſome
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0249600800:38"/>
parts of Trade feel it already, and how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
all other parts will be effected by it.</p>
               <p>I move you then to put your Hands to
all Legal Preventions; I aim at no other:
I move you to joyn in all juſt Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
both of the Miſchief and the Remedy,
to thoſe in whoſe Power it is to relieve you
I mean, your Parliament-Men; your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives;
who, as they are moſt of them
choſen by the ſeveral Trading Corporations
of <hi>England,</hi> may be more particularly call'd
the Repreſentatives of the Trading-Part
of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the profeſt Phyſicians of all our
Trading Maladies; I may ſay, 'tis their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to heal you, and I am ſure it is in their
Power; repreſent it to them in Parliament,
and repreſent it to them out of Parliament;
let them come up to Parliament fairly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
of the Caſe; fully convine'd of the
Juſtice of your Complaints, and the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Neceſſity there is of relieving you: Let
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0249600800:39"/>
them ſee it; make them Witneſſes, in the
Countries where they live, of the Decay
of the Manufactures; of the Abatement
made upon the Poor in their Wages; of the
Numbers of Poor that deſert, and run from
one Work to another for want of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Shew them the Rolls of your Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
which, I am ſatisfy'd, will diſcover
how many Families, more than ever, are
liſted among your Penſioners; for whom
Pariſh Proviſion is neceſſarily made, for want
of their getting Bread by the Works they
were wont to be employ'd in; ſhew them
the languiſhing Circumſtances of the People,
as <hi>the Effect</hi>; and then lay before them the
languiſhing Circumſtances of the Trade, as
the Cauſe; then they will come up to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
convinc'd of your Diſtreſſes,
fully prepar'd to receive your Petitions, and
fill'd with Compaſſionate Thoughts for your
Redreſs.</p>
               <p>I muſt conſeſs, this ſeems to me to be the
moſt proper Method, to ſpirit the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0249600800:40"/>
Aſſembly of Parliament with Sentiments
of Pity for their County, and with a juſt
Knowledge of the Reallity of, and Reaſon
for the Complaints you make; and if I
might be allow'd to ſuppoſe, that theſe
Sheets ſhall any where come to the Hands of
the particular Members in the Manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Counties and Corporations for which
they ſerve, I would, with all poſſible Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
but alſo with the utmoſt Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
petition them to look a little into the
State of the Manufactures in their reſpective
Countries where they live.</p>
               <p>It is without doubt, the juſt Concern, of
our Repreſentatives, to ſtudy the Intereſt
and the Circumſtances of the People who
they repreſent. If theſe Gentlemen pleaſe
but to look round them, they muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
ſee that the Manufactures decline,
that Trade languiſhes, and the Poor ſtretch
our their Hands to them for Help. They
muſt needs alſo ſee the Cauſes of it, even at
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0249600800:41"/>
their own Doors, while they cannot but ſee
a wilfully-poſſeſs'd Nation, dreſs'd up in the
Manufactures of Foreigners, and deſpiſing
the Workmanſhip of their own People:
Madly ſending their Money to <hi>India</hi> and
<hi>China,</hi> to feed and ſupport Heathens and
Savages; and neglecting, nay, I may ſay,
Rejecting the Manufactures of their own
Country, tho' they ſee the poor Families
ſtarving for want of Work.</p>
               <p>I preſs the People in the Countries to lay
open their Caſe before their Repreſentatives
and convince them of the melancholly Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
they are in, by the Decay of
Trade, and the Stop of their Manufactures;
and give them a clear View of the Nature
of the Grievance, and whence it proceeds;
and there is no room to doubt, but the
Members would be affected with it, as well
as other Men.</p>
               <p>'Tis from the ſame Principle, that I move
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0249600800:42"/>
the Gentlemen themſelves to enquire into
the Caſe, and make themſelves fully Maſters
of both the Fact and the Reaſon of it: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, I would not ſuffer it to be nam'd
as a Doubt, but that the natural Concern
every Member of Parliament muſt have for
the Proſperity of the People he repreſents,
will move him effectually to apply himſelf
in Parliament to the Remedy.</p>
               <p>'Tis a great Miſtake to ſuggeſt, that <hi>Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Fields</hi>
alone Complains, or has cauſe to
Complain; tho', as I ſaid before, the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers
there feel the Burthen ſooner; but
all the Country, and almoſt all the Branches
of the Woollen and Silk Manufactures feel it:
And 'tis eaſy to ſhew, why the Town Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
feel the ſtop of Trade ſooner than the
Country Workmen. The Caſe is this:</p>
               <p>The Clothiers, and Drugget or Stuff-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in the Country, who are the head Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers
of the Woollen Manufactures, are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0249600800:43"/>
generally Men of Subſtance and good Stocks;
they have often whole Towns and Villages
employ'd in their particular Works; and tho'
they do feel a ſtop of the Trade at Markets,
they do not ſo immediately put a ſtop to
their works, but they muſt keep their Markets
and make their Circuits, to take in the Yarn,
and put out the Wool, or their Neighbours
will break in upon them, their Spinners will
ſeek Work in other Hands, and, perhaps, not
be gotten again when they may want them.</p>
               <p>Thus they go on a great while, tho' the
Goods, when made, do not ſell, 'till <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well-Hall</hi>
lies piled up to the Roof with
Goods, and the Wholeſale-Men and Factors
Ware-Houſes are throng'd with them; nay,
even then they go on, and are forc'd to draw
upon the Factors and Wholeſale Dealers for
the Money, whether the Goods ſell, or no:
The Factors again are ſometimes forced to
ſell them to Mony'd-Men under the Price,
and perhaps to Loſs; nay, and even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to pawn or pledge them for Money,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0249600800:44"/>
in hopes of a Market to come; and ſtill with
the Money anſwer'd by thoſe Bills, the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
in the Country goes on, as long as he
can get Credit for a Bag of Wool to Work,
or a Penny of Money to pay his VVorkmen:
And this cauſes the Country Poor not to
feel the Check and Decays of their Trade ſo
ſoon as the Town Workmen. But then we
muſt take this with us, as we go, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that
when the Trade droops ſo long together,
and the Country Manufacturer or Clothier
is forced to ſtop, 'tis more fatal to the Poor,
<hi>as above</hi>; for then as they are long before
they ſtop, ſo they are longer before they
recover, and the Poor are, as it were, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
deſtitute for a great while.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Spittle-Fields</hi> the Caſe alters; here
the Manufacturers, I mean, the Maſters, are
near the Market: They do not put out the
Wool to Spinning, but generally buy it in
the Yarn: As ſoon is the Market ſtops, they
ſtop; if they cannot ſell their Work, they
immediately knock off their Looms, and the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0249600800:45"/>
Journeymen as immediately ſtarve and want
Work. Thus as Diſtempers near the Heart,
or in the Vital Parts, are ſooner and more
ſenſibly felt, than in the leſs Noble Parts of
the Body; ſo the Diſeaſe, of Trade, the
Decay and Stop of Sale, is moſt ſenſibly
and ſooner felt here, than in the Country,
and therefore Here the Complaint is firſt
made, and loudeſt.</p>
               <p>But this on the other hand, teſtifies
to us, that if it be not provided for forwith,
if ſome preſent Remedy be not apply'd to it,
the ſpreading malignity will ſoon extend it
ſelf, and the moſt extream Part will then
feel it: And what's the Conſequence? but
that then the Complaint will come up louder
and be more uneaſy to us.</p>
               <p>All theſe things urge us, if poſſible, to
apply ſome ſpeedy, ſome immediate Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to the Evil. What that Remedy is, and
what alone can cure us, I refer to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0249600800:46"/>
of it; the preſent Buſineſs is to lay down
the Fundamental, (<hi>viz.</hi>) ſhew the Diſeaſe,
awaken the Nation, open their Eyes to the
Conſequences of it, and guide them in their
Applications to the proper Perſons, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
can take it in hand, and that is, <hi>as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi>
the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Certainly if the Members of Parliament
in the ſeveral Countries would but enquire
a little into the Particulars, now they are at
leiſure, they would come up big with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſet their helping hand to it; they
would come up fill'd with Reſentment at
thoſe who have been Inſtruments to ruin the
flouriſhing Trade of their Country and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
could influence them againſt the humble
propoſals that may be made to them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
the Trade and Proſperity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>It
is ſuggeſted, that all Applications of
this King will meet with a powerfull Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0249600800:47"/>
and that the Manufacturers, however
numerous they are, will not find Friends
enough to carry their Point againſt the
Wearing and Uſing the Printed Callicoes.</p>
               <p>For my part, I cannot be of this Opinion:
It is true, I have not <hi>told Noſes,</hi> as they call
it, or caſt up the Strength on either ſide, or
examin'd who ſhall be the Friends, or who
the Enemnies of the VVeavers Petitions; but
this I venture to ſay, that as I have prov'd
the Grievance is National, this, I think
will follow, that none of the Nation's
Friends can be Enemies to the Propoſals for
a Remedy. It is our Satisfaction that this is
no Party Cauſe, unleſs any one ſhould vilely
inſinuate, that there is a Party that would
not have the Manufactures thrive, or would
have the Poor ſtarv'd and periſh; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have ſuch ill Notions of any Man as to
think Party can carry them that length;
Trade is a perfect Neuter in all our unhappy
Strife: Spinning and Weaving are neither
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0249600800:48"/>
                  <hi>Whig</hi> or <hi>Tory,</hi> but the great Articles by
which we live, by which the conſumption
of our Produce is carry'd on, and by which
the Poor are ſubſiſted, who without it,
would, in a word, eat us up all.</p>
               <p>If this Cauſe Meets with Enemies; if any
one Man can be found in <hi>Britan,</hi> who
would not have us leave off Painted Feathers,
and ſtick to our own Manufactures; I ſay
if one Man can be found ſo prepoſſeſs'd, it
muſt be either a Man perfectly ignorant in
Matters of Trade, and ſo not worth talking
to; or it muſt be ſome Callicoe Printer, or
his Employer and Dependant, who, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Account in the Miſchief, acts upon
the corrupt Principle of being willing to get
Money tho' at the Expence of the Ruin of
his Country; ſomething like the wretched
Sexton of <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> in the Year 1665,
who, being employ'd at the <hi>Peſt-bouſe</hi> near
<hi>Old-ſtreet,</hi> would have had the <hi>Plague</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0249600800:49"/>
that his Fees might not abate, but that
he might have People enough to Bury.</p>
               <p>But let us not fright our ſelves with the
imaginary Notion of Enemies, and a ſtrong
Oppoſition: <hi>Nil Deſperandum,</hi> let us take
but true Meaſures, ſetting the Fact in a clear
light, and convincing our Repreſentatives,
in a peaceable but effectual manner, of the
Weight of the Caſe, and how juſtly they
are concern'd, as Repreſentatives, to eſpouſe
the Trading Intereſt of their Country; I
can never imagine, that any Cabals of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Men, Brokers, and Job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
ſhall be able to byaſs the Members of a
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament againſt it, or to blind
their Eyes in a Caſe ſo clear as this, that
wearing a foreign Manufacture, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
our own, is the moſt prepoſterous, tho'
the moſt certain Method of ſtraving us all,
that can poſſibly be invented.</p>
