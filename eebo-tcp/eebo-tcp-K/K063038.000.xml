            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>Tthoſe who judge of dramatic merit from the Greek models, the rules of French critics, or the examples of modern writers, a juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the following piece would be attempted in vain. They would call it a motley perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, deficient in almoſt every article, which conſtitutes a true and proper tragedy. If the author was to alledge, that he never meant to compoſe a tragedy, according to their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word, but that his intention was to fill up a picture of real life, in a certain given time, the outlines of which were taken from hiſtorical facts, his reaſon would be deemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>Regardleſs of the end propoſed, they would continue to exclaim, that the unities were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that the grave was intermingled with the ludicrous; that the buſineſs of the drama frequently ſtood ſtill; that the dialogue was too familiar, and the metre little better than mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured proſe.</p>
            <p>How far ſome of theſe objections may be valid, and how many more might, perhaps, with
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0608202000:4"/>
reaſon be urged againſt particular paſſages, the author would not determine. The force of others of them he would endeavour to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, by anſwering, that they militate equally againſt human life itſelf; and that while he ſhould be ſorry to have this denominated an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial poem, he would flatter himſelf, it cannot be juſtly thought an unnatural one.</p>
            <p>Dr. Johnſon indeed, in the preface to his edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Shakeſpeare, ſeems to have ſufficiently vindicated this particular ſpecies of writing, to which, thoſe who pleaſe, may (inſtead of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy) give the more ſimple name of hiſtory. Neither are there wanting many good judges of compoſition, who wiſh that the leſs ſtudied diction, and more plain and level metre of the ſchool of that immortal poet, (which ſeems to have ended with Southern) had been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to the preſent time. Even this perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, with all its imputed irregularities and deficiencies, will, perhaps, be preferred by them, to thoſe tranſlated tragedies or imitations, which of late years have, through novelty, lived their nine nights on the ſtage, and been damned for ever after in the cloſet: tho' they had been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and metamorphoſed by managers, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to afford to favourite actors or actreſſes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſhining, and curtailed by lord chamberlains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0608202000:5"/>
A diverſification of characters hath been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in this piece; and to give to every cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter the mode of ſentiment and expreſſion, peculiarly ſuited to it. It is not at all difficult for a man of a very middling genius, to contrive a regular plot, to pen down a certain number of ſounding lines; and though his Dramatis Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonae are diſtinguiſhed by particular names, to put his own ſentiments in their mouths through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out five acts. Had the author been ſolicitous of adapting his plan to the ſtage, or wiſhed to conciliate the favour of the indiſcriminating multitude, he might probably have followed the ſame method.</p>
            <p>However it may appear to us, when we are reading, no ſmall attention is requiſite in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dialogue of any kind, for an author entirely to caſt off ſelf. This was the characteriſtic of Shakeſpeare; and perhaps after all, the author of this play hath deceived himſelf, and it may with reaſon be applied to him.</p>

                  <l>The peeviſh, amorous, whining, doating god</l>

                  <l>And thinking of its follies; though myſelf</l>

                  <l>Hear then the plain truth.</l>
                  <l>Now two nights ſince, when firſt we ſaw Lucretia,</l>
                  <l>Her air, her voice, her look, her every motion,</l>
                  <l>Inkindled paſſion in me e'en to madneſs.</l>
                  <l>Thou doſt remember how my ſoul was buried</l>

                  <l>I ſwore then to poſſeſs her. All that evening</l>
                  <l>She unadviſedly with new incentives</l>
                  <l>Stirr'd up my purpoſe; but quite unreſolved</l>
                  <l>How to purſue that purpoſe, I laſt night</l>

                  <l>Accompanied me; buſineſs of importance</l>
                  <l>Feign'd for my quick return. Her huſband's friend,</l>

                  <l>A nightly gueſt; yet in her eye, methought,</l>

She, without doubt, had heard his character,</l>
                  <l>And hard 'twas to diſſemble. I nought heeded</l>

                  <l>I'll dare the proudeſt of my country's foes,</l>
                  <l>And with the ſword of vengeance, on his creſt</l>
                  <l>Engrave a mark indelible: tell him</l>
                  <l>No Roman murders women: that we leave</l>
                  <l>To Tarquin and his ſons; even the croud</l>
                  <l>Purſued her only through the ſtreets with curſes,</l>
                  <l>Invok'd the furies of her parents on her,</l>
                  <l>And ſaw her paſs the city gate; ſo hence</l>
                  <l>In ſafety go, to him who ſent thee hither.</l>

                  <l>To-morrow will Horatius and Herminius,</l>
                  <l>The Ardeates having to a truce agreed</l>

Then in the common meeting of the people,</l>
                  <l>Leſt they ſhould think two kings inſtead of one</l>
                  <l>(Though choſen annually) may lord it o'er them;</l>
                  <l>One of us, Collatine, will lay aſide</l>
                  <l>Our ſymbols of command, only reſumed</l>
                  <l>Alternate month by month. The good Papirius,</l>
                  <l>King of the holy things, ſhall offer up</l>
                  <l>Our general ſacrifice, while we again,</l>
                  <l>And every individual then aſſembled,</l>
                  <l>Both for ourſelves and our poſterity,</l>
                  <l>Renew our ſolemn oath ne'er to admit</l>
                  <l>One of the Tarquin race. This night (more grateful</l>
                  <l>Than clouds-of inconſe) let our ſecret prayers,</l>
                  <l>Our private gratitude, and thanks, aſcend</l>
                  <l>To the high-ruling powers. For howſoe'er,</l>
                  <l>Vain man may think he plans with arduous care,</l>
                  <l>'Tis they alone his ſentiments inſpire,</l>
                  <l>They fill his breaſt with more than mortal fire,</l>
                  <l>'Tis they alone light up the patriot flame,</l>
                  <l>They lift the humble, and the haughty tame,</l>
                  <l>They every human accident foreſee,</l>
                  <l>To them not accident, but certainty.</l>
