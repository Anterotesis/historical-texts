            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ABOVE thirty years ago, Mr. WILKS (then one of the patentees of the theatre royal) gave an old manuſcript play, call'd, <hi>The Guiltleſs Adultreſs; or, Judge in his own Cauſe,</hi> to Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER, who was then manager of what us'd to be call'd, <hi>the ſummer company.</hi> This company conſiſted, in general, of the junior part of the performers; who, during the vacation time, commonly acted twice, or thrice, a week. As they play'd on ſhares (divided in proportion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral ſalaries ſtipulated in the winter) their endeavours to pleaſe the town generally produc'd 'em double pay, on thoſe nights; ſometimes more.</p>
            <p>This kept moſt of 'em from ſtrolling into the country, for the ſummer ſeaſon: it added to their income, and gave 'em an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of getting forward in their buſineſs, in a more regular manner, than has been practis'd of late years. It had its effect: performers then try'd their force in characters, in the ſummer; and became, by practice therein, gradually acquainted with their buſineſs, and the town with them. Nor was every one ſuppos'd to be equal, at their very ſetting out, to the moſt capital characters of the drama.</p>
            <p>But to return to the play.—By the hand, and the long time it had been in the poſſeſſion of the managers, it was ſuppos'd to have been one of Sir WILLIAM D'AVENANT's (formerly a patentee) and, by the opening of the piece, palpably was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a play of MASSENGER's, call'd, <hi>The Fatal Dowry—</hi>(this laſt piece has often been enquired after in vain)—Mr. WILKS recommended it to Mr. CIBBER to be got up in the ſummer, with ſome alterations—It lay by ſome time.—In the year 1733, it was intended for the ſtage in the ſummer—But the performers were then ſhut out of the theatre, by the then patentees of Drury-Lane.—A candid account of which will be given, when Mr. CIBBER has a proper opportunity to ſpeak thereof, in his purpos'd hiſtory of the ſtage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0048400100:3"/>
In the following year, when the principal comedians of that time return'd from the theatre in the Hay-Market, and play'd under the direction of Mr. FLETEWOOD, it was propos'd agen to have a ſummer company; as the uſe of it, both to the actors and managers, had been experienced. Many light pieces were then reviv'd, and ſeveral new petit pieces brought on the ſtage; ſuch as, <hi>The Devil to Pay, The Mock Doctor,</hi> &amp;c. which prov'd afterwards laſting entertainments in the winter ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>'Twas in <hi>The Devil to Pay,</hi> in a ſummer ſeaſon, Mrs. CLIVE (then Miſs KAFTOR) firſt ſurpriz'd a delighted audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with a proof of her extraordinary genius, in the character of NELL. Her ſpirited ſimplicity, and ſtrong natural humour, carried her thro' the part with an aſtoniſhing variety, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. She ſhew'd herſelf an excellent original.—She has had many followers, ſome imitators; and, 'tis but juſtice to add, no equal. She then promis'd to be, what ſhe has ſince prov'd, one of the firſt performers of the ſtage: and, when judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly examined in the general various caſt of parts ſhe acts, 'tis imagined, ſhe will be allow'd not to be inferior to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of her time.</p>
            <p>Well, this is digreſſion on digreſſion—(pardon it, reader, and let it paſs)—In 1734, a ſummer company was agen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. They play'd once the play of <hi>George Barnwell,</hi> to a very great houſe. The manager (jealous, leaſt the company ſhou'd get too much) order'd the farther acting to be ſtopp'd. It was judg'd, indeed, the jealouſy of ſome actors (who were not concern'd in the ſummer) gave this advice—ſo the affair dropp'd—and there has been no ſummer playing ſince.</p>
            <p>But, to return to our play.—On a reviſal, it was judg'd to want ſome alterations—Accordingly, Mr. CIBBEE requeſted his kind friend the late Mr. HILL (who was never happier than when he had an opportunity to do a friendly office) to correct it—How much he was taken with the play, will appear on a peruſal of ſome letters of his relative thereto, (pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in his collection) and ſent to Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER, about the year 1746.—Let it ſuffice here, to add—Mr. HILL almoſt new wrote the whole; and the laſt act was entirely his, in conduct, ſentiment, diction, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0048400100:4"/>
It was brought on the ſtage at the theatre in the Hay-Market early this year, 1758—When his Grace the Duke of DEVON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIRE humanely conſider'd the unfortunate, extraordinary condition of a comedian (who has had more frequent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of happily entertaining the town) and gave him liberty to try his fortune, awhile, at the little theatre in the Hay-Market.</p>
            <p>But what mighty matters could be hop'd, from a young, raw, unexperienced company, haſtily collected, and as haſtily to be employ'd (but ſinking men catch at reeds) while eſtabliſh'd theatres were open to entertain the town, with the united force of tragedy, comedy, opera, pantomime, ſong, dance, and a long train of <hi>et ceteras—</hi>Some rational, and ſome other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, which are ſo frequently follow'd in a winter ſeaſon?</p>
            <p>Mr. CIBBER was out of pocket by his undertaking; yet this does not prevent his having a grateful ſenſe of the favours he received, from thoſe noble perſonages, and other friends, who have frequently pratonis'd his undertakings.—To acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a favour, is but gratitude—To name the perſons, might appear vanity.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper, on this occaſion to ſignify, as Mr. CIBBER has not had the wiſh'd ſucceſs at the theatre in the Hay-Market—That Mr. RICH has, with great good-nature, granted the uſe of his theatre in Covent-Garden to Mr. CIBBER, for his benefit, the beginning of next month—When a <hi>new mock-tragedy,</hi> (which many perſons of taſte have approv'd of, and which the author has kindly allow'd Mr. CIBBER to make uſe of on this occaſion) will be acted, with all the variety of ſcenes, machines, ſongs, dirges, proceſſions, &amp;c. &amp;c.—requiſite to embelliſh (<hi>a-la-moderne</hi>) this extraordinary heroick piece.</p>

               <l>By nature mov'd, your patience thus I try;</l>
               <l>Art would but give my ſuff'ring ſoul the lie.</l>

               <l>I'VE 'ſcap'd, to-night, two terrible diſaſters;</l>
               <l>My honour's indignation—and my maſter's:</l>
               <l>And heaven beſt knows what hapleſs hole can hide me,</l>
               <l>If (to crown all my woes) your help's deny'd me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>LADIES, you ſee how much expos'd our ſex is;</l>
               <l>Sleeping, or waking, ſome ſad chance perplexes.</l>
               <l>Man's a more wily ſnake than mother EVE's was;</l>

               <l>Hungry devourer! never tir'd with ſnapping;</l>
               <l>Shun him with open eyes—he'll catch us napping:</l>
               <l>And how to 'ſcape him, if I know—ne'er let me</l>
               <l>Break thro' th' entangling nets, that thus beſet me.</l>
