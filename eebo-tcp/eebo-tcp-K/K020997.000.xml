            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Not leſs abſurd to flatter Nero's eyes.</hi>] Pliny furniſhes us with this ſingular anecdote, as an inſtance of the extravagant abuſe of Portrait-painting in his days, which, as he informs us, had arrived to a degree of madneſs. "Nero had ordered himſelf to be painted under the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Coloſſus, upon cloth or canvaſs, a hundred and twenty feet in height." The ſame author informs us, that this prepoſterous pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when it was finiſhed, met with its fate from lightning, which conſumed it, and involved likewiſe the moſt beautiful part of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens where it was placed in the conflagration. The Reader may find ſome ingenious remarks upon this ſubject, in the Notes ſur l'Hiſtoire de la Peinture ancienne extraite de l'Hiſtoire naturelle de Pline. Fol. London, 1725.</p>

                     <hi>Bleſs be the pencil! which from death can ſave.</hi>] The ſweet illuſion of this enchanting art is prettily expreſſed in a Letter of Raphael's to his friend Franceſco Raifolini, a Bologneſe painter. The two artiſts had agreed to exchange their own portraits, and Raphael, on receiving his friend's picture, addreſſes him in the following words:</p>
                  <p>"Meſſer Franceſco mio caro ricevo in queſto punto il voſtro ritratto — egli è belliſſimo, e tanto vivo, che m' inganno talora, creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domi di eſſere con eſſo voi, e ſentire le voſtre parole."</p>

                  <p>The charm of Portrait-painting is ſtill more beautifully deſcribed in verſe by a friend of Raphael's, the amiable and accompliſhed Count Balthaſor Caſtiglione.

                     <hi>Inſpir'd by thee, the ſoft Corinthian Maid.</hi>] Pliny has tranſmitted to us the Hiſtory of the Maid of Corinth and her father. "Dibutades, a potter of Sicyon, firſt formed likeneſſes in clay at Corinth, but was indebted to his daughter for the invention; the girl being in love with a young man who was ſoon going from her into ſome remote country, traced out the lines of his face from his ſhadow upon the wall by candle-light. Her father, filling up the lines with clay, formed a buſt, and hardened it in the fire with the reſt of his earthen ware." Plin. Lib. 35.</p>
                  <p>Athenagoras, the Athenian philoſopher, gives a ſimilar account of this curious and entertaining anecdote, adding the circumſtance that the youth was ſleeping when the likeneſs was taken from his ſhadow. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In the Poeſies de Fontenelle there is an epiſtle from the Maid of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, whom the author calls Dibutadis, to her imaginary lover Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. She deſcribes her own work in the following Stanzas:</p>

                     <hi>'Twas then Panaeus drew, with freedom's train.</hi>] Panaeus was the brother of Phidias, the celebrated Sculptor, whom he is ſaid to have aſſiſted in his nobleſt works. Pauſanias, in his Fifth Book, gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſeveral pictures by this early Artiſt, and particularly of the picture here alluded to. It was painted in the celebrated portico called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Beſides a general repreſentation of the conflict, the flight of the barbarians, and a diſtant view of their ſhips, Theſeus, Minerva, and Hercules were, according to this author, exhibited in the piece. The moſt conſpicuous figures among the perſons engaged were Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus, and Miltiades, and a hero called Echetlus: he mentions alſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0346500500:63"/>
another hero, who is introduced into the picture, called Marathon, from whom, he ſays, the field had its name.</p>
                  <p>Pauſanias, fol. Lip. 1696. p. 37.</p>
                  <p>From Pliny's account of the ſame picture we learn that the heads of the generals were portraits—adeo jam colorum uſus percrebuerat, adeoque ars perfecta erat ut in eo Praelio ICONICOS duces pinxiſſe tradatur.— Plin. Lib. 35. c. 8.</p>
                  <p>Miltiades had the honour of being placed foremoſt in this illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious group, as a reward for his having ſaved Athens, and all Greece.</p>

Pauſanias ſpeaks of the pictures here alluded to, and in his Tenth Book, introduces a very long deſcription of other pictures by the ſame artiſt, painted alſo from Homer in the Temple at Delphos. The paſſage however gives but a confuſed and imperfect idea of the painter's performance. How much the art is indebted to this ancient maſter, what grace and ſoftneſs he gave to the human countenance, what embelliſhments he added to the female figure and dreſs, are much more happily deſcribed by Pliny. Primus Mulieres lucidâ veſte pinxit, capita earum mitris verſicoloribus operuit, pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mumque picturae primus contulit: ſiquidem inſtituit os adaperire, dentes oſtendere, vultum ab antiquo rigore variare. The ſame author likewiſe bears honourable teſtimony to the liberal ſpirit of this great artiſt, who refuſed any reward for his ingenious labours in the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico.

                     <hi>Thy tragic pencil, Ariſtides, caught.</hi>] The city of Thebes had the honour of giving birth to this celebrated Artiſt. He was the firſt, according to Pliny, who expreſſed Character and Paſſion, the Human Mind, and its ſeveral emotions; but he was not remarkable for ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of colouring. "His moſt celebrated picture was of an infant (on the taking of a town) at the mother's breaſt, who is wounded and expiring. The ſenſations of the mother were clearly marked, and her fear leaſt the child, upon failure of the milk, ſhould ſuck her blood." "Alexander the Great," continues the ſame author, "took this picture with him to Pella."</p>
                  <p>It is highly probable, according to the conjecture of Junius, (in his learned Treatiſe de Picturâ Veterum) that the following beautiful epigram of Aemilianus was written on this exquiſite picture:

Not only admirable beyond his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in his own profeſſion of Painting, but an excellent Architect and Muſician, and of great ſkill as an Anatomiſt. Beſides all theſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0346500500:68"/>
he was, according to Vaſari, the beſt extempore Rimer of his Time.—His Hiſtory and Works are well known.—The ſingular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of his dying in the arms of Francis the Firſt, king of France, is mentioned by a French poet of the preſent age,
<q>
                        <l>Lorſque Francois premier, Roi digne d' être heureux,</l>

                     </q>
And the particulars of his death are thus curiouſly recorded by Vaſari, who ſpeaks in raptures of his various and exalted talents:</p>
                  <p>Finalmente venuto vecchio, ſtette molti meſi ammalato, et veden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſi vicino alla morte, ſi volſe diligentemente informare de le coſe catoliche, &amp; della via buona, et ſanta religione chriſtiana, et poi con molti pianti confeſſo e contrito, ſe bene e' non poteva reggerſi in piedi, foſte nendoſi nelle braccie di ſuoi amici, e ſervi, volſe divotamente pigliare il ſantiſſimo ſacramento, fuor del letto: ſopragiunſeli il Rè che ſpeſſo e amerevolmente le ſoleva viſitare: per il che egli per rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renza rizzatoſi a ſedere ſul letto, contando il mal ſuo &amp; gli accidenti di quelle moſtrava tuttavia quanto aveva offeſo dio, et gli huomini del mendo, non avendo operato nel arte come ſi conveniva: onde gli venne un paroſiſmo meſſagiero della morte. Per la qual coſa rizzatoſi il Rè, et preſola la teſta per aiutarlo, &amp; porgerli Favore, accio che il male lo allegeriſſe; lo ſpirito ſuo, che diviniſſimo era, conoſcendo non potere havere maggiore honore, ſpirò in braccio à quell rè nella etá ſua d' anni 75.</p>

                     <hi>Taſte, Fancy, Judgment, all on Raphael ſmil'd.</hi>] Raffaello da Urbino was born in 1483, and died 1520. His amiable qualities as a Man were not inferior to his exalted talents as an Artiſt. The reader will not be diſpleaſed to ſee the ſingular eulogium which the honeſt Vaſari has beſtowed on the engaging manners of this moſt celebrated Genius.</p>
                  <p>Certo fra le ſue doti ſingulari ne ſcorgo una di tal valore che in me ſteſſo ſtupiſco; che il cielo gli diede forza di poter moſtrare nell' arte noſtra uno effetto ſi contrario alle compleſſioni di noi pittori: queſto è che naturalmente gli artefici noſtri, non dico ſoli i baſſi, ma quelli che hanno umore d' eſſer grandi (come di queſto umore l'arte ne produce infiniti) lavorando nell' opere in compagnia di Raffaello, ſtavano uniti e di concordia tale che tutti i mali umori in veder lui s'amorzavano: e ogni vile e baſſo penſiero cadeva loro di mente. La quale unione mai non fu piu in altro tempo che nel ſuo. E queſto aveniva perche reſtavano vinti dalla corteſia e dall' arte ſua, ma più dal genio della ſua buona natura.</p>
                  <p>Vaſari Vita di Raff. p. 88.</p>
                  <p>To atone for the imperfect ſketch, which has been here attempted of theſe divine artiſts, (Michael Angelo and Raphael) the author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have preſented the reader with a long quotation from a moſt animated diſcourſe of the Preſident of the Royal Academy, in which he has placed theſe great maſters in a light of compariſon with each other. But as the diſcourſes of Sir Joſhua Reynolds are no longer ſcarce (a new edition being now publiſhed) he ſhall refer the reader to the Work itſelf.

                     <hi>And thou, Velaſquez, ſhare the honour due.</hi>] Don Diego Velaſquez de Silva, the moſt accompliſhed of the Spaniſh Painters, was born at Seville, 1594, and clos'd his honourable and ſplendid life at Madrid in 1660.—His maſter was Pacheco, a Spaniard, who united the ſiſter arts of Painting and Poetry.—Velaſquez was patronized by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Olivarez, and had the honour of painting our Charles the Firſt, during his viſit at Madrid: perhaps he contributed not a little to form the taſte and paſſion for art, by which that Prince was ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed. The Spaniſh Painter roſe to great honours in his own country, and had, like Rubens, the ſingular fortune to unite the character of an Ambaſſador with that of an Artiſt, being ſent on an extraordinary commiſſion, in 1648, to Pope Innocent X.</p>
                  <p>One of his moſt ſtriking hiſtorical pictures, was the expulſion of the Moors from Spain; a noble, national ſubject, which he painted for Philip the Third, in competition with three Artiſts of reputation, and obtained the preference.</p>
                  <p>But he is particularly celebrated for the ſpirit and energy of his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits; concerning which there are two ſingular anecdotes related by his Spaniſh Biographer; and the following may poſſibly amuſe the reader.</p>
                  <p>In 1639, he executed a portrait of Don Adrian Pulido Pareja, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of an armament appointed to New Spain; and pleaſed himſelf ſo well in the execution, that he affixed his name to the picture; a circumſtance not uſual with him. He had painted with pencils of uncommon length, for the ſake of working at a greater diſtance, and with peculiar force; ſo that the picture (ſays my Spaniſh author) when near, is not to be diſtinguiſhed, and at a diſtance is a miracle. As Velaſguez,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0346500500:77"/>
after this Portrait was finiſhed, was at work in the palace, the King, as uſual, went privately to his apartment to ſee him paint; when obſerving the figure of Pareja, and taking it for the real perſon, he exclaimed with ſurprize, <q>What! are you ſtill here? have you not your diſpatches? and why are you not gone?</q> But ſoon perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his miſtake, he turn'd to Velaſquez (who modeſtly doubted the reality of the deception) and ſaid, "I proteſt to you it deceived me." For this ſtory, ſuch as it is, I am indebted to the author whom I have quoted in the preceding Note. The celebrated Murillo, whoſe pictures are much better known in England than thoſe of his maſter, was a diſciple of Velaſquez.</p>

                     <hi>Yet, Holland, thy unwearied labours raiſe.</hi>] There is no article of taſte, on which different writers have run more warmly into the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite extremes of admiration and contempt, than in eſtimating the painters of Holland. Thoſe who are enchanted by the ſublime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Roman ſchool, are too apt precipitately to condemn every effort of the Dutch pencil as a contemptible performance; while thoſe, who are ſatisfied with minute and faithful delineations

of nature, find abſolute perfection in the very pictures, which are treated by others with the moſt ſupercilious neglect.—But ſound and impartial judgment ſeems equally to diſclaim this haſty cenſure, and this inordinate praiſe;— and ranking the moſt eminent Dutch artiſts below the great Italian maſters, yet allows them conſiderable and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar merit.—A French author ſays, I think not unhappily, of the Dutch painters, that they are "Dans la peinture, ce que le comique &amp; le plaiſant ſont dans la poeſie."

The hiſtory of his life furniſhes a moſt ſtriking incentive to the young painter's ambition.—The many accompliſhments which he poſſeſt, the infinitude of works which he produced, the reputation and eſteem, the various honours and ample f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though he viſited the court of Charles the Firſt in the publick character of an ambaſſador, it does not appear how long he reſided here;—Mr. Walpole conjectures about a year.—His pictures in the ceiling at Whitehall were not painted in England; which perhaps is the reaſon he has been at the pains of finiſhing them ſo neatly, that they will bear the neareſt inſpection; for he muſt have well known how greatly the reputation of any work depends on its firſt happy impreſſion on the publick, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his pictures would be viewed by the king and court inſtantly on their arrival, and that the critics would not be candid enough to delay their remarks on them till they were elevated to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

On his firſt viſit to England he received no encouragement from the Court, but Charles, becoming ſoon afterwards acquainted with his merit, ſent him an invitation to return.

                     <hi>From Flanders firſt the ſecret power ſhe caught.</hi>] The Low Countries, though little celebrated for inventive genius, have given to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind the two ſignal diſcoveries, which have imparted, as it were, a new vital ſpirit both to Literature and to Painting. This honour however has been brought into queſtion—Germany made a ſtrong, but unſucceſsful effort to rob Holland of the glory which ſhe derives from the firſt invention of Printing: and Painting in oil (it has been ſaid) was known in Italy before the time of John Van Eyck, or John of Bruges, as he is commonly called; to whom that diſcovery is generally aſcribed, about the year 1410.—But Vaſari, in his Life of Antonello da Meſſina, relates very particularly the circumſtances
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0346500500:82"/>
of Van Eyck's invention, and the ſubſequent introduction of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret into Italy. A moſt learned antiquarian and entertaining writer of our own time has ſuppoſed that Van Eyck might poſſibly "learn the ſecret of uſing oil in England, and take the honour of the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf, as we were then a country little known to the world of arts, nor at leiſure, from the confuſion of the times, to claim the diſcovery of ſuch a ſecret."—Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting, Vol. I. p. 29.—The conjecture is not without ſome little founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—but the conjectural claims which either Italy or England can produce to this excellent invention, are by no means ſufficiently ſtrong to annihilate the glory of the happy and ingenious Fleming.</p>
                  <p>Since the preceding part of this Note was written, the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of Van Eyck, and his encomiaſt Vaſari, has been very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly attacked in an Eſſay on Oil-painting, by Mr. Raſpe; an Eſſay which diſcovers ſuch a zealous attachment to the arts, and ſuch an active purſuit of knowledge, as do great credit to its ingenious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But, though I have peruſed it with the attention it deſerves, it does not lead me to retract what I had ſaid; becauſe, after all his reſearches on this ſubject, it appears that although Oil-painting was not abſolutely the invention of Van Eyck, it was yet indebted to him for thoſe improvements which made it of real value to his profeſſion. —The ingenious Fleming ſeems therefore to be ſtill entitled to thoſe honours that have been laviſhed on his name, as improvement in ſuch caſes is often more uſeful and more meritorious than invention itſelf, which is frequently the effect of chance, while the former ariſes from well-directed ſtudy.</p>

                     <hi>Untrodden paths of Art Salvator tried.</hi>] Salvator Roſa was born at a village near Naples, in 1615. After a youth of poverty and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he raiſed himſelf by his various and uncommon talents into lucrative reputation. Having paſſed nine years at Florence, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable employment, he ſettled in Rome, and died there at the age of 58, in 1673.—He was one of the few characters who have poſſeſſed a large portion of pleaſant vivacity and ſatirical humour, with a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime imagination. His talents as a painter are univerſally celebrated; but his ſocial virtues, though perhaps not inferior, are far from being ſo generally known. In the "Raccolta di Lettere ſulla Pittura" there are many of his letters to his intimate friend Ricciardi, an Italian poet, and profeſſor of moral philoſophy at Piſa, which perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the warmth of his friendſhip, and the generoſity of his heart.— They contain alſo ſome amuſing anecdotes relating to his profeſſion, and the great delight which he took in diſcovering hiſtorical ſubjects of a peculiar caſt, untouched by other painters, and appearing to an ignorant eye almoſt beyond the limits of his art. He ſeems to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe himſelf with juſtice, as well as energy, in the following words of a letter to Ricciardi "tutto bile, tutto ſpirito, tutto ſuoco."— Though he muſt have been wonderfully pleaſant as a companion, and valuable as a friend, yet he laments that his ſatires had made him many enemies, and heartily wiſhes he had never produced them: In that which relates to painting, he expoſes indeed the vices of his brethren with great freedom and ſeverity.—It is remarkable that his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0346500500:84"/>
poetry abounds more with learned alluſions than with high flights of imagination; yet in the ſatire I have mentioned, there is much whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical fancy. An ape is introduced applying to a painter, and begging to learn his profeſſion, as Nature he ſays has given him a genius for the mimetic arts.—The painter complies—but his diſciple, after an apprenticeſhip of ten years, bids his maſter adieu, with many humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous execrations againſt the art of Painting,—Other parts of the poem contain many ſenſible and ſerious remarks on the abuſes of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and as the author has given us a portrait of himſelf in his poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical character, I ſhall preſent it to the reader as a ſpecimen of his ſtyle.</p>

                     <hi>Yet to thy Palace Kneller's ſkill ſupplied.</hi>] Sir Godfrey Kneller, born at Lubec 1646, ſettled in England 1674, was knighted by King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, created a Baronet by George the Firſt, and died 1723.—No Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ever more flattered by the Muſes; who gave him credit for talents which he never diſplayed. Dryden ſays, in his enchanting Epiſtle to Kneller:
<q>
                        <l>Thy genius, bounded by the times, like mine,</l>
                        <l>Drudges on petty draughts, nor dares deſign</l>
                        <l>A more exalted work, and more divine.</l>
                     </q>
But the drudgery of the Poet aroſe from the moſt cruel neceſſity; that of the Painter, from avarice, the bane of excellence in every profeſſion!—If Sir Godfrey had any talents for hiſtory, which is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very doubtful, we have, as Mr. Walpole well obſerves, no reaſon to regret that he was confined to portraits, as his pencil has faithfully tranſmitted to us <hi>"ſo many ornaments of an illuſtrious age."</hi>

Notwithſtanding his extreme modeſty, he had the good fortune to be appointed Principal Painter, ſoon after the Revolution, but died an early martyr to the gout 1691.</p>

a gallery for artiſts, completely filled with a ſmall but well-choſen collection of caſts from the antique, and engaged two eminent artiſts to ſuperintend and direct the ſtudents.—This noble encouragement of art, though ſuperſeded by a royal eſtabliſhment, is ſtill entitled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and honour: it not only ſerved as a prelude to more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive inſtitutions, but contributed much towards forming ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital artiſts of the preſent time.

                     <hi>Teach but thy tranſient tints no more to fly.</hi>] Although the ſuperior excellencies of this admirable artiſt make us peculiarly regret the want of durability in his exquiſite productions; yet he is far from being the only artiſt, whoſe pictures ſoon diſcover an appearance of precipitate decay. Fugitive colouring ſeems indeed to be the chief defect among our preſent painters in oil; and it muſt be the moſt ardent wiſh of every lover of art, that ſo great an evil may be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually remedied. As the Royal Academy is a ſociety of enlightened artiſts, eſtabliſhed for the improvement of every branch of Painting, it may be hoped that they will pay attention to this mechanical point, as well as to the nobler acquirements of art, and employ ſome perſon, who has patience and abilities for ſuch an office, to diſcover, by a courſe of experiments, to what cauſe this important evil is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If it be found to ariſe from the adulteration of colours, oils, and varniſhes, might it not be eligible for the Academy to follow the example of another profeſſion, who, where health and life are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, obviate the difficulty of getting their articles genuine from the individual trader, by opening a ſhop at the expence of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to prepare and fell the various ingredients, free from thoſe adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations which private intereſt might otherwiſe produce?</p>
                  <p>But there may be no juſt ground of complaint againſt the integrity of the colourman, and this failure may perhaps ariſe from the artiſt's
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0346500500:91"/>
mixing his colours, and their vehicles in improper proportions to each other; that is, inſtead of painting with oil properly thickened with colour, uſing oil only fully ſtained with it, to which a proper conſiſtence (or body as the painters call it) is given by ſtrong gum varniſhes; in ſhort, uſing more vehicle than colour; by which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moſt brilliant and tranſparent effects may be produced, yet the particles of colour are too much attenuated, and divided from each other, and conſequently leſs able to withſtand the deſtructive action of light. If the deficiency complained of originates from this ſource, the Academy, by a careful courſe of experiments, may be able clearly to aſcertain what preparations of the more delicate colours are moſt durable; what oils and varniſhes will beſt preſerve the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal brilliancy of the paint; what are the beſt proportions for this purpoſe in which they can be uſed; and how far glazing (that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt irreſiſtible temptation to oil-painters) may or may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on. All theſe points are at preſent ſo far from being known with certainty, that perhaps there are not two Painters, who think perfectly alike on any one of them. The author hopes, that the gentlemen of the pencil will pardon his preſuming to offer a hint on this delicate ſubject, with which he does not pretend to be intimately acquainted. The ideas, which he has thus ventured to addreſs to them, ariſe only from the moſt ardent wiſh, that future ages may have a juſt and adequate ſenſe of the flouriſhing ſtate of Painting in England in the reign of George the Third, and that our preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent artiſts may not be reduced to depend on the uncertain hand of the engraver for the eſteem of poſterity.</p>
                  <p>A very liberal Critic<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Vide</hi> the Gentleman's Magazine for November 1778, page 526.</note>, in his flattering remarks on the Poem, ſeems, in ſpeaking of this Note, to miſtake a little the meaning of its author, who alluded only to that defect in colouring, where the finer tints are ſo managed, for the ſake of an immediate and ſhort-liv'd brilliancy, that they ſink very ſoon into no colour at all. He did not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0346500500:92"/>
mean to touch on thoſe changes in Painting, where the colours all grow darker, the lights become brown, and the ſhadows one maſs of black. This is likewiſe a great evil, and calls aloud for redreſs. Perhaps the Critic above mentioned has pointed out the true cauſe of this defect, <hi>viz.</hi> the indiſcriminate blending of the colours, and the not uſing pure, ſimple, uncompounded tints.</p>

A young and noble author, now living, has obliged the world with a tranſlation of it in rhyme.—As to the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no artiſt could expreſs more happily the wild and ſublime ſpirit of the poet from whom he drew.

                     <hi>Now Art exults, with annual Triumphs gay.</hi>] While we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the increaſing ſplendor of theſe annual entertainments, it is but juſt to remember, that we are indebted to the Society of Arts and Sciences for our firſt public exhibition of Paintings. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſocieties of artiſts ſoon followed ſo excellent an example; and our rapid and various improvements in this lovely art reflect the higheſt honour on this happy inſtitution. Our exhibitions at once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford both the beſt nurſery for the protection of infant genius, and the nobleſt field for the diſplay of accompliſhed merit: nor do they only adminiſter to the benefit of the artiſt, and the pleaſure of the publick: they have ſtill a more exalted tendency; and when national ſubjects are painted with dignity and force, our exhibitions may juſtly be regarded as ſchools of public virtue. Perhaps the young ſoldier can never be more warmly animated to the ſervice of his country, than by gazing, with the delighted public, on a ſublime picture of the expiring hero, who died with glory in her defence. But, not to dwell on their power of inſpiring martial enthuſiaſm, our exhibitions may be ſaid to have a happy influence on the manners and morals of thoſe, who fill the different departments of more tranquil life. In ſupport of this ſentiment I beg leave to tranſcribe the following judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious remark from an author, who has lately obliged the public with two little volumes of elegant and ſpirited Eſſays. "They, whoſe natural feelings have been properly improved by culture, nor have yet become callous by attrition with the world, know from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how the heart is mollified, the manners poliſhed, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſweetened, by a well-directed ſtudy of the arts of imitation. The ſame ſenſibility of artificial excellence, extends itſelf to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of natural and moral beauty; and the ſtudent returns from the artiſt's gallery to his ſtation in ſociety, with a breaſt more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to feel and to reverberate the endearments of ſocial life, and of reciprocal benevolence."—KNOX's Eſſays, moral and literary, 1778, p. 264, on Sculpture.</p>

                     <hi>Whoſe needy Titian calls for ill-paid gold.</hi>] Richardſon has fallen into a miſtake concerning the famous Danae, and other pictures of Titian, which he ſays (in quoting a letter of Titian's without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering its addreſs) were painted for Henry the VIIIth of England, a tyrant indeed, voluptuous, and cruel, but ſtill leſs deteſtable than the ſullen and unnatural Philip the IId of Spain, who filled up the meaſure of his ſuperior guilt by the horrid aſſaſſination of his ſon. Philip, on his marriage with Mary, aſſumed the title of King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and to him Titian addreſſed the letter, which ſpeaks of the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in queſtion: the painter frequently mentions his attachment to his unworthy patron.</p>
                  <p>His ſollicitude to enſure his protection and favour is ſtrongly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following ſhort paſſage of a letter which he addreſſed to one of Philip's attendants.

The ſtriking ſcene here alluded to, which preceded the death of Sidney, has not yet, I believe, appeared upon canvaſs, but is forcibly deſcribed by the noble and enthuſiaſtic friend of Sidney, the Lord Brooke.—See Biograph. Britan. Art. Sidney.</p>
                  <p>The particulars alſo are minutely deſcribed, and with great feeling, in a letter from his uncle Leiceſter to Sir Thomas Heneage, quoted in Collins's Memoirs of the Sidnies. The tide of national admiration flowed very ſtrong in favour of Sidney, when Mr. Walpole, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lord Brooke, appeared to check the current; but the merits of Sidney are ſufficient to bear down all oppoſition.—Inſtead of joining the elegant author I have mentioned, in conſidering Sir Philip Sidney as "an aſtoniſhing object of temporary admiration," I am ſurprized that ſo judicious an author ſhould ever queſtion ſo fair a title to univerſal regard. The learning and munificence, the courage

and courteſy of Sidney endeared him to every rank, and he juſtly challenges the laſting affection of his country from the cloſing ſcene of his life, in which heroiſm and humanity are ſo beautifully blended. I never can think this accompliſhed character any ways degraded by his having written a tedious romance (in which however there are many touches of exquiſite beauty and ſpirit) to amuſe a moſt amiable ſiſter, whom he tenderly loved; or by his having threatened an unworthy ſervant of his father's with death in a haſty billet, merely to intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and deter him from the future commiſſion of an infamous breach of truſt, in opening his letters.</p>

                  <p>"After Sir Thomas More was beheaded, ſhe took care for the burial of his body in the chapel of St. Peter's ad Vincula, within the precincts of the Tower, and afterwards ſhe procured his corpſe to be removed, and buried in the chancel of the church at Chelſea, as Sir Thomas More, in his life-time, had appointed. His head having remained about fourteen days upon London Bridge, and being to be caſt into the Thames to make room for others, ſhe bought it. For this ſhe was ſummoned before the council, as the ſame author relates, and behaved with the greateſt firmneſs, juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her conduct upon principles of humanity and filial piety. She was, however, impriſoned, but ſoon releaſed, and dying nine years after her father, at the age of thirty-ſix, was buried at St. Dunſtan's, in Canterbury. The head of her father, which ſhe had preſerved with religious veneration, in a box of lead, was, at her particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, committed with her to the grave. It was ſeen ſtanding on her coffin in the year 1715, when the vault of the Roper (her huſband's) family was opened."—See Ballard's Memoirs of learned Ladies, p. 36.</p>

                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0346500500:97"/>The character of this amiable woman is happily drawn both by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon and Walpole.—She married, at the age of twenty, William Roper, Eſquire, of Kent, to the infinite ſatisfaction of her father; for ſhe ſeems to have been the deareſt object of his parental affection, which is very ſtrongly marked in his letters addreſſed to her. She was indeed moſt eminently diſtinguiſhed by her learning, in an age, when the graces of the mind were regarded as an eſſential article in female education: but the beauty and force of her filial piety reflects a ſtill ſperior luſtre on this accompliſhed woman.—There is more than one paſſage in her life, which would furniſh an admirable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the pencil.

                  <p>In recommending this ſubject to the pencil, it may be proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it is not only extremely difficult, but even attended with danger, if we credit the following curious anecdote, in a medical writer of great reputation:—Spinello, fameux Peintre Toſcan, ayant peint la chute des anges rebelles, donna des traits ſi terribles à Lucifer, qu'il en fut lui-meme ſaiſi d'horreur, &amp; tout le reſte de ſa vie il crut voir continuellement ce Demon lui reprocher de l'avoir repreſenté ſous une figure ſi hidieuſe.—Tiſſot de la Santé des Gens de Lettres.</p>
