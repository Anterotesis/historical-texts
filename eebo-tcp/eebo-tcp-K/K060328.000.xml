            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Preface.</head>
            <p>THE following Treatiſe is but a
ſmall part of a Volume of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm
intended to be publiſh'd
in Folio, in which in Treating of the works
of the moſt Celebrated Engliſh Poets De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd,
I deſign'd to ſhew both by Reaſon
and Examples, that the uſe of Religion in
Poetry was abſolutely neceſſary to raiſe it
to the greateſt exaltation, of which ſo No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an Art is capable, and on the other ſide,
that Poetry was requiſite to Religion in order to
its making more forcible Impreſſions upon
the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:3"/>
And this I thought would be an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
way of Reconciling People to a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Stage, in ſpight of the Grimaces of
ſome Spiritual Comedians; who have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a mind to be the only Actors in
Vogue; and who in order to a total ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Stage, have endeavour'd to
ſet up private Authorities againſt the
common Senſe of Mankind, and the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of two or three Churchmen againſt
Divine Inſpiration. For I appeal to any
impartial Reader, whether the conſtant
practice in all Ages of the beſt and the
bravest Nations in their moſt flouriſhing
States, may not paſs for the common
Senſe of Men: And we know very well
that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom we believe to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inſpir'd, has made uſe of Heathen
Poets nay ev'n Heathen Dramatick Poets,
for the Reformation of Mankind. Witneſs
that famous paſſage, <hi>Evil Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
corrupt good manners;</hi> which St.
<hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of in his Second Epistle
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and which <hi>Grotius</hi>
informs us that he borrow'd from the
<hi>Thais</hi> of the famous <hi>Menander.</hi> Now how
that which was the Language of the Holy
Ghoſt, in the Mouth of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> comes
to be the Language of the Devil in ours,
I believe our Bigots will find it a Difficult
matter to ſhew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:4"/>
It it plain then that theſe Perſons by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
totally to ſuppreſs the Stage, which
is the only encouragement that we have
in theſe Iſlands of Poetry, manifeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to drive out ſo noble and uſeful an
Art from among us, and by that means
endeavour'd with all their might to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the power of Religion, which has need
of Poetry to make its utmost Impreſſion
upon the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, almoſt all but the Ceremonial
and Hiſtorical part of the old Teſtament,
was deliver'd in Poetry and that is almoſt
Half of it. And a conſiderable part of the
Doctrine of the Goſpel was deliver'd in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
which, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> has juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerv'd in his Advancement of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Lib. 2 Chap.</hi> I. are a kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Poeſy. I might here very truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that not only <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Song and part of the Prophets, but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
too of our Saviours Parables, are tho'
not Dramatick Poems, yet Poeſy that is
Dramatical, that is Poeſy in which Perſons
are introduc'd who are talking in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:5"/>
From what has been ſaid, this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
muſt undeniably follow, that either
they who deliver'd our Religion were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in the manner of doing it, which
will by no means conſiſt with our Belief
of the Divinity of one of them, or the
Divine Inspiration of the Reſt, or that
our Religion muſt be moſt powerfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by the ſame means, by which it
was at firſt deliver'd.</p>
            <p>I believe that it would be an eaſie
matter to prove, that it was the uſe of
exalted Poeſy, ſuch as the lofty Hymn of
St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that blew up the Flame of
Chriſtian zeal to ſuch a tranſporting
height, in the Primitive and Apoſtolical
times, and that the neglect of ſo Divine
an art, has not only in theſe latter Days
conſiderably leſſen'd the force of Religion,
but has with ſome People among us gone
a very great way towards the making the
Publick Worſhip contemptible. But I leave
it to our Prelates and Paſtors to conſider,
whether, ſince they are ſatisfy'd that there
is a neceſſity, for an Harmonious and a
Numerous Style, in ſome parts of our Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip, they ought ſo long to have
remain'd contented with the vile Meetre
of <hi>Hopkins,</hi> and by that proceeding to
ſuffer the moſt Lofty and moſt Pathetick
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:6"/>
Divine Poetry to be Burleſqu'd and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicul'd
in our Churches, which is all one,
as if each Sunday they ſhould dreſs up a
Biſhop in ſome Antick Habit, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him in that merry Garb in Order to
raiſe the Veneration of the People.</p>
            <p>That Poetry is neceſſary for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Religion upon the Minds of Men,
may I think appear very plainly from
what has been ſaid, and from what will be
ſaid upon that Subject in the following
Treatiſe. But ſince our Clergy by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
practiſe appear to be already ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
of it, I leave it to them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whether they ought not rather to
make it part of their buſineſs, to ſet Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry
and conſequently the Stage upon a
good Foot, than to endeavour with all their
might to drive out both from among us.</p>
            <p>Since I mention'd my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
I deſire the Readers leave to lay
before him a moſt Beautiful Paſſage of
that great genius concerning the worth
and the uſe of Poetry, which he eſteems
to be the Second principal Bruanch of
Learning.</p>
            <p>As for Narrative Poeſy (ſays he in
the 13 <hi>Ch.</hi> of the 2 <hi>Lib.</hi> of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Learning) or, if you
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:7"/>
pleaſe, Heroical, ſo you underſtand it
of the Matter, not of the Verſe, it
ſeems to be rais'd altogether from a
noble Foundation, which makes much
for the Dignity of Man's Nature.
For ſeeing the ſenſible World is in
Dignity inferior to the Soul of Man,
Poeſy ſeems to endow human Nature,
with that which Hiſtory denies, and
to give ſatisfaction to the Mind,
with at leaſt the Shadow of things,
where the Subſtance cannot be had.
For if the matter be throughly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
a ſtrong Argument may be drawn
from Poetry, that a more ſtately
Greatneſs of things, a more perfect
Order, and a more beautiful Variety,
delights the Soul of Man, than can
be any way found in Nature, ſince
the fall. Wherefore ſeeing the Acts
and events, which are the Subject of
True Hiſtory, are not of that ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
as to content the Mind of Man,
Poeſy is ready at Hand to fain Acts
more Heroical. Becauſe true Hiſtory
reports the Succeſſes of Buſineſs not
proportionable to the merit of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and Vices, Poeſy corrects it, and
preſents Events and Fortunes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Deſert; and according to
the Law of Providence. Becauſe true
Hiſtory, through the frequent Satiety
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:8"/>
and Similitude of things, works a
Diſtaſt and Miſpriſion in the Mind
of Men, Poetry Cheereth and Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the Soul; Chanting things rare and
various, and full of Viciſſitudes, ſo as
Poetry ſerveth and conferreth to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation,
Magnanimity, and Morality;
and therefore it may ſeem deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have ſome Participation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineneſs;
becauſe it doth raiſe the
Mind, and exalt the Spirit with high
Raptures, by proportioning the Shews
of things to the Deſires pf the Mind,
and not ſubmitting the Mind to
things, as Reaſon and Hiſtory do.
And by theſe Allurements and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities,
whereby it cheriſheth the Soul
of Men, joyned alſo with Conſort of
Muſick, whereby it may more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſinuate it ſelf, it hath won ſuch
Acceſs, that it hath been in Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even in Rude Times, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations, when other Learning
ſtood excluded.</p>
            <p>But becauſe that Poetry which we call
Heroick, has been but barely neglected
among us, and the great Cry has been
againſt the Dramatick, let us ſee what the
ſame extraordinary Perſon ſays in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:9"/>
Dramatick or Repreſentative Poeſy,
ſays he, which brings the World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage, is of excellent uſe if it
were not abus'd. For the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Corruptions of the Stage may
be great; but the Corruptions in this
kind abound; the Diſcipline is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neglected in our times. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
in Modern Commonwealths, Stage-Plays
be but eſteemed a Sport or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
unleſs they draw from the Satyr
and be mordant; yet the Care of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
was, that the Stage ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the Minds of Men unto Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Nay, wiſe Men and great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
have accounted it as the
Archet or Muſical Bow of the Mind.
And certainly it is moſt true, and as
it were a Secret of Nature, that the
Minds of Men are more patent to
Affections, and Impreſſions Congregate
than Solitary.</p>
            <p>In this laſt Obſervation which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Beautiful, my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a very ſolid Reaſon, why the Drama
muſt be more uſeful than History, and more
prevalent than Philoſophy. And a little
lower he has given two more, though he has
applied them to a ſort of Poetry which is
ſomewhat different, and thoſe are, that
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:10"/>
Dramatick Fables are more ſenſible than
Arguments; and more fit than Examples.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, that extraordinary
Man declares like a most juſt and discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Judge, that the Modern Stage was but
a Shadow of the Antient, and an imperfect
Shadow; that it had ſomething of its Shew,
but nothing of its Reality; that is, that it
was not only a vain and an empty, but a
dangerous Amuſement. And he plainly
taxes the Modern Policy with the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of its Diſcipline. Indeed in this as
well as other things, there is as great a
difference between Antient and Modern
Policy, as there is between Antient and
Modern Extent of Empire.</p>
            <p>But the Wiſdom of the Queen can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be too much extolled, who has vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
to take care of that which all Her
Predeceſſors neglected.</p>
            <p>That Diſcerning Princeſs is reſolved to
ſupport the Stage, that it may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to the Reforming Her People; and
She is reſolved to Regulate it, that it
may no longer be juſtly accus'd of corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Manners.</p>
            <p>The following Treatiſe, as has been ſaid
above, is but a ſmall Portion of a much
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:11"/>
larger which was deſign'd for the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Modern Poetry, and of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
particularly. And here I deſire the
Reader's Leave to do two things. Firſt
to lay down the Deſign and Method of the
larger Treatiſe, and then to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to the World why no more is Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
            <p>The Deſign then, and the Method of
the whole Treatiſe, as they were deliver'd
in the Second Propoſal, are as follows.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>FIrſt,</hi> The Deſign is To reſtore
Poetry to all its Greatneſs, and
to all its Innocence.</p>
            <p>That Poetry is miſerably fall'n, is,
I ſuppoſe, granted: And, as there
never was more occaſion for a juſt
and impartial <hi>Criticiſm</hi> on account
of the generality of the Writers;
ſo, there never was more neceſſity
for one on account of the Readers
and the Spectators. For the taſte
of both the Readers and the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
was never ſo debauch'd as if is
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:13"/>
at preſent; of which we have given
the Reaſons in another place. Some
of them would be thought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of every thing that they
either Read or See, and value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon that; that is, upon their
want of Diſcernment to diſtinguiſh
right from wrong: Others are ſo
ſqueamiſh, that they like nothing,
and value themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even upon
that too; that is, upon the ſicklineſs
and the unſoundneſs of their Minds;
becauſe he who likes nothing taſtes
nothing, and want of Taſte is want
of Senſe. But this is not all: even
they who pretend to like nothing,
will at the Play-houſes be pleas'd
with ev'ry thing; and they who
would be thought to approve of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, like nothing long; For
nothing but Truth can be long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd,
and Truth it ſelf, to be
long eſteem'd, muſt be diſtinguiſh'd
from Falſhood. From theſe ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ways of Judging it comes to
paſs, that this Town, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of ten Years, happens to have
one and the ſame Author in the
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:14"/>
greateſt Admiration and in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Contempt; which is infinitely
a greater Satyr upon the Town,
than it can be on the Author; for
the Town is certainly in the
wrong in one of the Extreams at
leaſt, and perhaps in both; whereas
the Authors, for the moſt part,
give no occaſion for either of them.
This random or this partial way
of Judging, has been the cauſe
that Poetry is baniſh'd from the
reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> and is upon its laſt
Legs in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deſign of the foreſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
is, not only to retrieve ſo noble
an Art, and to fix the Rules both
of Writing and of Judging, that
both Readers and Writers may be
at ſome certainty; but, to raiſe it
to a height which it has never
known before among us, and to
reſtore it, as we ſaid above, to
all its Greatneſs, and to all its
Innocence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:15"/>
But whereas ſeveral may imagine
that the Deſign is chimerical, of
reſtoring Poetry either to its Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or to its Innocence, we think
it proper to ſatisfie the Reader, in
as few words as we can, that
both may be eaſily effected.</p>
            <p>1. Poetry may eaſily be reſtored
to its former Greatneſs, becauſe
the diſcovering the Cauſe of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
is more than half the Cure
of it: but the true and almoſt
only Cauſe of the Declention of
Poetry, that Cauſe which has lain
hid for ſo many Ages, has been
already diſcovered in a little Tract
that was published two Years
ago<note n="*" place="bottom">Advancement and Reformation of Modern Poetry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>, for which I have the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſeveral of the beſt Judges
in <hi>England,</hi> and that matter will
be ſet in ſo clear a Light in the
beginning of the foreſaid Treatiſe,
without repeating any thing that
was ſaid before, or at leaſt as little
as may be, as may ſatisfie the moſt
incredulous. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:16"/>
2. Poetry may eaſily be reſtored
to its Innocence by taking a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Method, a Method that may
be more prevalent with the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
than either Law or Philoſophy,
which have been us'd in vain. For
let us but conſider the Character
that <hi>Horace</hi> has giv'n of a Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Vatis avarus</l>
                  <l>Non temere eſt animus, verſus amet, hoc ſtudet unum,</l>
                  <l>Detrimenta, fugas ſervorum; incendia ridet.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, a Poet will contemn
every thing but the acquiring the
Reputation of a good Poet. This
is what he makes his only Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the ſole deſign of his Life;
and there is no Reprimand that
you can give him, and no Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance
that you can make him,
that he will not laugh at, until
you convince him that he is an ill
Poet. And indeed he is partly in
the right; for an ill Poet is ten
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:17"/>
times more ridiculous than a
Blockhead of any other Profeſſion:
for an ill Phyſician, or an ill Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
know their own Ignorance,
and make it their buſineſs to be
eſteem'd by the People: but, on
the contrary, an ill Poet is found
out by every body, and admires
himſelf, than which nothing can
be more a Jeſt. So that there is
nothing he will refuſe to do to
avoid the Infamy of that Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
From whence it follows that
in the foreſaid <hi>Criticiſm</hi> there is a
Motive that will work more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iy
upon them than the Cenſures
of our Reformers: for there we
clearly ſhew them, that Poetry, by
loſing its Innocence, loſes its very
Nature; for if Poetry be more
philoſophical, and more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
than Hiſtory, as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
is pleas'd to affirm of it, and
no Man ever knew the Nature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Poetry, or of Hiſtory, or
of Philoſophy, better than he did;
why then that Art, or rather that
Artifice, with which a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Writers of Verſes and Plays de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:18"/>
and corrupt the People, is
a thing to which Poetry is as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary, as a Virgin is to
a Whore. And theſe People are no
more Poets, than thoſe Empricks
are Phyſicians who make their <hi>Jack-Puddings</hi>
ſwallow Potions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
them to the People,</p>
            <p>In the foreſaid Treatiſe we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew them, that Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
was not only the firſt Original,
but that it has been, is and will
be, the only ſolid Baſis, nay and
the very Life and Soul of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Poetry. That the farther Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
declines from that, the farther
it recedes from its very Nature
and Eſſence; and that the true
Poetry is as inconſiſtent and as
incompatible with Vice, as the
Harmony, and Light, and Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Heaven with the gloomy
Horrors of Hell; and the proving
this in ſo clear a manner as we
pretend to do, will oblige thoſe
Poets who are never ſo profligate
in their Inclinations, to be virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
at leaſt in their Writings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:19"/>
Both they and their Readers
will then be ſatisfied, that the true
Poetical Genius is a great and a
ſacred thing; and, to quote an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
paſſage from <hi>Milton,</hi> 'Is,
wherever it is found, the inſpir'd
Gift of God, rarely beſtow'd, but
yet to ſome (ſays he) in ev'ry
Nation, tho' moſt abuſe it: and is
of power, beſide the Office of a
Pulpit, to imbreed and cheriſh in
a great People the Seeds of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and publick Civility, to allay
the Perturbations of the Mind,
and ſet the Affections in a right
Tune, to celebrate in glorious and
lofty Hymns the Throne and
Equipage of God's Almightineſs,
and what he works, and what
he ſuffers to be wrought with
high providence in his Church; to
ſing victorious Agonies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
and Saints, the Deeds and
Triumphs of juſt and pious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
doing valiantly, thro' Faith,
againſt the Enemies of Chriſt; to
deplore the general Relapſes of
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:20"/>
Kingdoms and States from Juſtice
and God's true Worſhip. Laſtly,
Whatever in Religion is holy and
ſublime, in Virtue amiable or
grave, whatever hath Paſſion or
Admiration in all the changes of
that which is call'd Fortune from
without, or the wily Subtleties
and Refluxes of Man's Thoughts
from within; all theſe things
with a ſolid and treatable Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to point out and deſcribe;
teaching over the whole Book of
Sanctity and Virtue, thro' all the
inſtances of example, with ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
to thoſe eſpecially of ſoft
and delicious temper, who will
not ſo much as look upon Truth
her ſelf, unleſs they ſee her ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
dreſt; that whereas the
paths of Honeſty arid Good-life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
now rugged and difficult,
tho' they be indeed eaſie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
they would then appear to
all Men both eaſie and pleaſant,
tho' they were rugged and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
indeed. And what a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
this would be to our Youth
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:21"/>
and Gentry (<hi>continues he</hi>) may be
ſoon gueſt by what we know of
the Corruption and Bane which
they ſuck in daily from the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Interludes of libidinous
and ignorant Poetaſters, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſcarce ever heard of that
which is the main Conſiſtence of
a true Poem, the Choice of ſuch
perſons as they ought to introduce,
and what is moral and decent to
each one, do for the moſt part lap
up vicious Principles in ſweet
Pills to be ſwallow'd down, and
make the taſte of virtuous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments
harſh and four.' Thus
far goes <hi>Milton:</hi> And the Reader
may ſee that it was his Opinion,
That tho Poetry was in the main
miſerably ſunk among us; yet, that
it might be reſtor'd to its Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and its Greatneſs. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then to the doing this we
come to diſplay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Method that we
follow in the foremention'd <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:22"/>
We begin then with a <hi>Criticiſm</hi>
upon Poetry in general; in which
we endeavour to ſhew its Nature,
and its End, and the means which
it ought to uſe for the attaining
that End. And then we come to,
divide Poetry into its two great
Branches, the (Greater and the Leſs.</p>
            <p>1. We treat of the Greater Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
ſhew what its Nature and its
End are; and that the only certain
Method for the attaining its End,
is, the keeping ſtrictly up to its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which ſeems to have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
not very clearly underſtood.
And here we ſhall lay down ſome
general Rules, which are both few
and ſhort, but eternal and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable;
and for the want of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
which, it will appear
throughout this whole Treatiſe,
that the very beſt among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
and among the Moderns,
have not only made groſs Miſtakes,
but have deviated ſometimes, in a
great degree, from the Art.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:23"/>
And here too We endeavour to
ſhew the mutual Dependance that
the Greater Poetry has on Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and Religion on the Greater
Poetry; and to make it appear,
that all thoſe parts of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which were writ id Verſe,
ought to be tranſlated in Verſe, by
Reaſons which may have force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to convince us, that Verſe
tranſlated into Proſe is but half
tranſlated.</p>
            <p>When we have done this, We
come to Heroick Poetry; which
being a Branch of the Greater
Poetry, muſt have the ſame End,
and muſt participate of the ſame
Nature; and muſt beſides, have
ſomething particular in its Nature
to diſtinguiſh it from the other two
Branches, which are Tragedy, and
the Greater Ode. But becauſe too
much bare Speculation may prove
tedious to ſeveral Readers, we
ſhew what every Poet who writes
an Epick Poem is oblig'd to do, to
make that Poem keep to the Nature
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:24"/>
of Epick Poetry in general, and to
its own: This, I ſay, we endeavour
to ſhew, not by laying down the
Rules after the common Method,
but by ſhewing what <hi>Virgil</hi> has
done; becauſe that great Poet is ſo
exact, that he may be ſaid to have
written a <hi>Criticiſm</hi> upon Epick
Poetry by Examples, and becauſe
he is now, by Mr. <hi>Dryden's</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,
to be reckon'd among our
own Poets; and ſo comes within
the compaſs of my Deſign.</p>
            <p>When by doing this we have
laid down the Rules, we come
briefly to examine, Whether thoſe
Rules are always to be kept invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable;
and if they are not, in what
parts, and by whom, they may be
alter'd. Then we ſhew how <hi>Spencer,</hi>
by not following thoſe Rules, fell ſo
very far ſhort of the Ancients; And
afterwards we endeavour to make
it appear, how <hi>Milton,</hi> by daring
to break a little looſe from them
in ſome particulars, kept up in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others to the Nature of the
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:25"/>
Greater Poetry in general, and of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
Poetry in particular, better
than the beſt of the Ancients. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this we treat of the other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Poets, who have written any
thing that comes near to Heroick
Poetry; and ſhew of them all, as we
go along, how they differ from one
another, how from the beſt of the
Ancient Poets, and the beſt of the
Moderns of other Countries.</p>
            <p>The Branch of the Greater Poetry
which we conſider next is Tragedy,
which we treat of after the ſame
manner with Heroick Poetry, and
ſhew what ev'ry one who writes a
Tragedy is oblig'd to do, to make
that Poem come up to the Nature
of the Greater Poetry in general,
and of Tragedy in particular, by
ſhewing what <hi>Sophocles</hi> has done in
his <hi>OEdipus</hi> (which will be there
tranſlated) and for what Reaſons;
where we endeavour to diſplay the
Beauties of his admirable Conduct,
and to clear the Moral by a very
different Method from what <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Dacier</hi> has taken. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:26"/>
that by doing this we have
laid down the Rules, the firſt of any
length that were ever extant in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
we by thoſe examine the Plays
of our moſt celebrated Tragick Poets,
in their Fables, Characters. Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Expreſſions, Harmony; ſhew
what diſtinguiſhes them, from one
another, from the beſt of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and the moſt famous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns
of other Countries. And
here we make it our buſineſs to
ſhew how much the preſent <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Stage is degenerated from the Virtue
and Greatneſs of the Ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
and what is to be done to
reſtore Modern Tragedy firſt to the
Innocence, and ſecondly to the
Greatneſs of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Stage.
And here we examine whether it is
not poſſible to advance <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
to a greater Height than ever
the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets arriv'd.</p>
            <p>In the next place we deſcend to the
third and laſt Branch of the Greater
Poetry, which is the Greater Ode,
which we treat of after the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:27"/>
manner with the two preceding, and
ſhew what the compoſer of ſuch an
Ode is oblig'd to do, to make it keep
up to the Nature of the Greater Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in general, and to its own. And
here we have occaſion to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that of theſe three Branches of
Poetry, the Ode is the moſt dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated:
For ſince the Nature of
Poetry conſiſts in Paſſion; and that
of the Greater Poetry in great Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as we make it appear in the
foremention'd <hi>Crticiſm;</hi> and ſince
that which we commonly call Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion
is very rarely to be found in
the Greater Ode, it follows that
the excellence of the Greater Ode
muſt conſiſt in extraordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion,
which can be nothing but
ſtrong <hi>Enthuſiaſm;</hi> but Religion is
the greateſt, nobleſt, ſtrongeſt
ſource of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> as we very
clearly ſhew; ſo that the Modern
Ode, by for ſaking Religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
for the moſt part prophane,
has parted with that from which
it deriv'd its greateſt excellence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:28"/>
And that the excellence of the
Greater Ode is deriv'd from Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
we make appear not only
by the Examples of thoſe very
few which are admirable among
our own, but by thoſe of <hi>Pindar</hi>
and <hi>Horace;</hi> and we ſhew that
the firſt of thoſe great Maſters
was ſo throughly convinc'd of this
at the ſame time, that he was
oblig'd, by the deſire of Gain, to
celebrate the Triumphs of worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Coachmen and Jockeys, that
his numerous extravagant Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to be attributed, in a
great meaſure, to that Conviction
join'd with that Obligation. When
we have done this,</p>
            <p>2. We deſcend to the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of Poetry, which is the
Leſs and ſhall treat of thoſe
Branches of it in which our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Poets are moſt concern'd, after
the ſame Method that we treated
of thoſe of the Greater. Where
firſt we ſhall ſpeak of the Little
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:29"/>
Ode, and ſhew for what Reaſons
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets have, for the
moſt part miſcarried in it. Then
we ſhall give the Reader a large
<hi>Criticiſm</hi> upon Comedy, the firſt of
any Moment that will be extant
upon it in any Language. And
here we ſhall endeavour to make
it appear, that as the Moderns
have apparently the advantage of
the Ancients in Comedy, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
have it of the reſt of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns.</p>
            <p>We ſhall end with a <hi>Criticiſm</hi>
upon Satyr, where we ſhall ſhew
the true difference between that
and a Libel or Lampoon; and the
uſefulneſs of the one, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs
of the other.</p>
            <p>Thus have we laid before the
Reader. the Deſign and Method of
the Work. But becauſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Reader cannot but ſee,
that it is impoſſible for any Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
to make it worth the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker's
Trouble in employing ſo
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:30"/>
much Time and Thought as ſo
great and important a Deſign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
the lovers of <hi>Criticiſm</hi> are
therefore deſir'd, at leaſt thoſe who
have Spirit enough to promote ſo
generous an Undertaking, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
it by their Subſcriptions at
the Rate of a Guinea a Book, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
half a Guinea down at the
time of ſubſcribing, and half at
the delivery of the Book in
Quires; the Undertaker at the
ſame time, promiſing, that not a
Book ſhall be printed more than
the number ſubſcribed.</p>
            <p>For the greater variety, the Lives
of the ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets will be
added in their proper places.</p>

            <p>THE next Poet of whom
we ſhall treat is <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
one of the greateſt and

a glorious preſent of the
moſt lofty, but moſt irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Poem, that has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by the Mind of Man.
That great Man had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> deſire
to give the World ſomething
like an Epick Poem; but he reſolv'd
at the ſame time to
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:32"/>
break thro' the Rules of
<hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Not that he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of them, or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd
them. On the contrary, no
Man knew them better, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
them more, becauſe no
Man had an Underſtanding
that was more able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the neceſſity of them;
and therefore when he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
them in the little
Treatiſe which he wrote to
Mr. <hi>Hartlib,</hi> he calls the
Art which treats of them, a
ſublime Art. But at the ſame
time he had diſcrenemnt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſee, that if he wrote
a Poem which was within
the compaſs of them, he ſhould
be ſubjected to the ſame Fate
which has attended all who
have wrote Epick Poems e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince the time of <hi>Homer;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0365900900:33"/>
and that is to be a Copyiſt
inſtead of an Original. Tis
true, the Epick Poets who
have liv'd ſince <hi>Homer,</hi> have
moſt of them been Originals
in their Fables, which are
the very Souls of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems;
but in their manner of
treating thoſe Fables, they
have too frequently been Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyiſts,
They have Copyed
the Spirit and the Images of
<hi>Homer;</hi> even the great <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
himſelf is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
<hi>Milton</hi> was the firſt,
who in the ſpace of almoſt
4000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Years, reſolved, for his
Country's Honour and his
own, to preſent the World
with an Original Poem;
that is to ſay, a Poem that
ſhould have his own Thoughts,
his own Images, and his
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:34"/>
own Spirit. In order to this
he was reſolved to write a
Poem, that, by vertue of its
extraordinary Subject, cannot
ſo properly be ſaid to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Rules, as it may
be affirmed to be above them
all. He had obſerv'd, that
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had drawn his Rules
which he has given us for
Epick Poetry from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
which he had made
upon <hi>Homer.</hi> Now he knew
very well, that in <hi>Homer</hi> the
Action lay chiefly between
Man and Man: For <hi>Achilles</hi>
and <hi>Hector</hi> are properly the
Principals, and the Gods are
but Seconds. He was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
therefore, that his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals
ſhould be the Devil on
one ſide and Man on the
other: and the Devil is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:35"/>
his Hero, becauſe he
gets the better. All the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in his Poem, excepting
two, are either Divine or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal.
So that moſt of the
Perſons and particularly one
of the Principals, being ſo
very different from what
<hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ever
thought of, could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be ſubjected to their
Rules, either for the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
or the Incidents. We
ſhall now ſhew for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
the choice of <hi>Milton</hi>'s
Subject, as it ſet him free
from the Obligation which
he lay under to the Poetical
Laws, ſo it neceſſarily threw
him upon new Thoughts,
new Images, and an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirit. In the next place
we ſhall ſhew, that his
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:36"/>
Thoughts, his Images, and
by conſequence too his Spirit,
are actually new, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from thoſe of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and <hi>Virgil.</hi> Thirdly,
We ſhall ſhew, that beſides
their Newneſs, they have
vaſtly the Advantage of thoſe
of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> And
we ſhall make this appear
from ſeveral things, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
from the Deſcription of
Hell, which has been deſcrib'd
by thoſe three great Poets
with all their Force and
with all their Art. After
that, we ſhall proceed to ſay
ſomething of <hi>Milton's</hi> Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and his Harmony; and
then we ſhall come to mark
his Defects with ſo much
the more exactneſs, becauſe
ſome of them ought to be
<pb facs="tcp:0365900900:37"/>
avoided with the utmoſt
Caution, as being ſo great,
that they would be Inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
in any one who had
not his extraordinary Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Qualities.</p>
            <p>Thus have we laid before the Reader the
Deſign and Method, and Specimen of the
larger Treatiſe, It now remains that I
ſhould give an Account why ſo ſmall a
part of it is Publiſh'd. As ſoon as I ſet
about the Performance, I eaſily foreſaw
that it would be a three Years Labour, and the
Judicious Reader, upon conſidering the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
cannot but be convinc'd of it. Yet
after I had been for a whole Year Digeſting
my own Thoughts, and conſidering other
Peoples, and making all ſorts of Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for the due Execution of ſo great a
Deſign: I ſaw that all the Perſons who

            <p>THE deſign of the enſuing
Treatiſe, whether we conſider
the Importance or the Extent
of it, is perhaps the Greateſt in this
kind of Writing, that has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

leſs than an Attempt to reſtore
and reeſtabliſh the nobleſt Art in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0365900900:47"/>
every Branch of it; an Art that by
the Barbarity of the Times is fall'n
and ſunk in them all, and has been
driv'n and baniſh'd from every
Country excepting <hi>England</hi> alone,
and is even here ſo miſerably fall'n
for the moſt part by the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of its Profeſſors, and by the
unskilfulneſs of its Admirers, that
we have reaſon to apprehend it to
be departing from hence too.</p>
            <p>That Poetry is the nobleſt of all
Arts, and by conſequence the moſt
inſtructive and moſt beneficial to
Mankind, may be prov'd by the
concording Teſtimony of the greateſt
Men, who have lived in every Age;
the greateſt Philoſophers, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Heroes, and the greateſt States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who have as it were unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
cheriſh'd, eſteem'd, admir'd
it, and never has it been diſeſteem'd
or neglected by any but ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders

and who have utterly wanted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0365900900:48"/>
to know what a glorious uſe
may be made of it, for the benefit
of civil Society: But in the ſequel
of this Diſcourſe, by diſcovering
the Nature of Poetry in general,
(which ſeems to me to have been
hitherto but little underſtood) I
ſhall clearly ſhew its Excellence,
and the Importance of this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.
And by laying down ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the general Rules of it, or by
tracing out that ſublime Art, which
to make uſe of <hi>Milton</hi>'s Expreſſion,
teaches what the Laws are of a true
Epick Poem, what of a Dramatick,
what of a Lyrick, what Decorum
is, what is the grand Maſter-piece
to obſerve. I ſhall not only lay a
good Foundation for the judging of
the Performance of the ſeveral Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
whoſe Works I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to examine, but ſhall as <hi>Milton</hi>
ſays in his Treatiſe of Education to
Mr. <hi>Hartlip,</hi> ſoon make the World
perceive what deſpicable Creatures
our common Rhymers and Play-Wrights
are, and ſhew them what
Religious, what Glorious and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Uſe may be made of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0365900900:49"/>
both in Divine and in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
things.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. II. That Poetry is to be Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
by laying down Rules.</head>
            <p>THAT an Art ſo Divine in
its Inſtitution, is ſunk and
profaned, and miſerably debaſed,
is a thing that is confeſt by all. But
ſince Poetry is fallen from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
which it once attained to,
it muſt be fallen either by the want
of Parts, or want of Induſtry, or
by the Errors of its Profeſſors. But
that it cannot be for want of Parts,
we have ſhewn clearly in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of modern Poetry; nor
can it be ſuppoſed to be for want of
Induſtry, ſince ſo many of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
have no other Dependance?
It remains then that it muſt have
fall'n by their Errors, and for want
of being guided right. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0365900900:50"/>
'tis for want of knowing by
what Rules they ought to proceed,
that Poetry is fall'n ſo low, it follows
then that it is the laying down of
thoſe Rules alone, that can re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
it. In ſhort, Poetry is either
an Art, or Whimſie and Fanaticiſm.
If it is an Art, it follows that it muſt
propoſe an end to it ſelf, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
lay down proper Means for
the attaining that end: For this is
undeniable, that there are proper
Means for the attaining of every
end, and thoſe proper Means in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,
we call the Rules. Again, if
the end of Poetry be to inſtruct and
reform the World, that is, to bring
Mankind from Irregularity, Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
and Confuſion, to Rule and
Order, how this ſhould be done by
a thing that is in it ſelf irregular and
extravagant, is difficult to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Beſides, the work of every
reaſonable Creature muſt derive its
Beauty from Regularity, for Reaſon
is Rule and Order, and nothing can
be irregular either in our Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or our Actions, any further than
it ſwerves from Rule, that is, from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0365900900:51"/>
Reaſon. As Man is the more perfect,
the more he reſembles his Creator:
The Works of Man muſt needs be
more perfect, the more they reſemble
his Makers. Now the Works of God
tho' infinitely various, are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regular.</p>
            <p>The Univerſe is regular in all
its Parts, and it is to that exact
Regularity that it owes its admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Beauty. The Microcoſm owes
the Beauty and Health both of its
Body and Soul to Order, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
and Diſtempers of both, to
nothing but the want of Order. Man
was created like the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
regular, and as long as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſo he continued happy; but
as ſoon as he fell from his Primitive
State, by tranſgreſſing Order, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Miſery was the immediate
Conſequence of that Univerſal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
that immediately followed.in
his Conceptions, in his Paſſions and
Actions.</p>
            <p>The great deſign of Arts is to
reſtore the decays that happen'd
to Humane Nature by the Fall,
by reſtoring Order: The deſign of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0365900900:52"/>
Logick is to bring back Order,
and Rule, and Method to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
the want of which cauſes
moſt of our Ignorance, and all our
Errors. The deſign of moral Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
is to cure the diſorder that
is found in our Paſſions, from which
proceeds all our Unhappineſs, and all
our Vice; as from the due order that
is ſeen in them, comes all our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and all our Pleaſure. But how
ſhould theſe Arts reeſtabliſh Order,
unleſs they themſelves were Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar?
Thoſe Arts that make the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
inſtrumental to the Pleaſure of
the Mind, as Painting and Muſick,
do it by a great deal of Rule and
Order, ſince therefore Poetry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the force of all theſe
Arts of Logick, of Ethicks, of
Eloquence, of Painting, of Muſick;
can any thing be more ridiculous
than to imagine, that Poetry it ſelf

that we may make this appear
the more plainly, let us declare what
Poetry is. Poetry then is an Art, by
which a Poet excites Paſſion (and
for that very cauſe entertains Senſe)
in order to ſatisfie and improve, to
delight and reform the Mind, and
ſo to make Mankind happier and
better; from which it appears that
Poetry has two Ends, a ſubordinate
and a final one, the ſubordinate one
is Pleaſure, and the final one is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0365900900:54"/>
Firſt, The ſubordinate end of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is to pleaſe, for that Pleaſure is the
buſineſs and deſign of Poetry is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
becauſe Poetry unleſs it pleaſes,
nay and pleaſes to a height, is the
moſt contemptible thing in the
World; other things may be born
with if they are indifferent, but
Poetry unleſs it is tranſporting is
abominable: nay it has only the
Name of Poetry, ſo inſeparable is
Pleaſure from the very nature of
the Thing.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, The final End of
Poetry is to reform the Manners;
as Poetry is an Art, Inſtruction
muſt be its final End; but either
that Inſtruction muſt conſiſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Manners, or it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
inſtruct at all, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be an Art; for Poetry pretends
to no other Inſtruction as its final
End: But ſince the final End of
Poetry is to reform the Manners,
nothing can be according to the true
Art of it which is againſt Religion,
or which runs counter to Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
or to the true Politicks, and to
the Liberty of Mankind; and every
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0365900900:55"/>
thing which is againſt the laſt, tends
to the Corruption and Deſtruction
of Mankind: And conſequently eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing againſt the laſt, muſt be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
inconſiſtent with the true Art
of Poetry.</p>
            <p>Now the proper Means for Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to attain both its ſubordinate
and final End, is by exciting Paſſion.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſubordinate End of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which is to pleaſe, is attained
by exciting Paſſion, becauſe every
one who is pleaſed is moved, and
either deſires, or rejoices, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,
or hopes, or the like. As
we are moved by Pleaſure which
is Happineſs, to do every thing
we do, we may find upon a little
Reflection, That every Man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by ſome Paſſion or other, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Action, or to Contemplation;
and Paſſion is the reſult either of
Action or of Contemplation, as
long as either of them pleaſe, and
the more either of them pleaſes,
the more they are attended with
Paſſion. The ſatisfaction that we
receive from Geometry it ſelf comes
from the joy of having found out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0365900900:56"/>
Truth, and the deſire of finding
more. And the ſatiety that ſeiſes
us upon too long a Lecture, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from nothing but from the
wearineſs of our Spirits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
from the ceſſation or the
decay of thoſe two pleaſing Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Poetry attains its final
end, which is the reforming the
Minds of Men, by exciting of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And here I dare be bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that all Inſtruction whatever,
depends upon Paſſion. The Moral
Philoſophers themſelves, even the
dryeſt of them, can never inſtruct
and reform, unleſs they move; for
either they make Vice odious and
Vertue lovely, or they deter you
from one by the Apprehenſion of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
or they incite you to the other,
by the Happineſs they make you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from it; or they work upon
your Shame, or upon your Pride, or
upon your Indignation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Poetry inſtructs and reforms
more powerfully than Philoſophy
can do, becauſe it moves more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully:
And therefore it inſtructs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0365900900:57"/>
more eaſily too. For whereas all Men
have Paſſions, and great Paſſions of
one ſort or another, and whereas
thoſe Paſſions will be employed, and
whatever way they move, they that
way draw the Man, it follows that
Philoſophy can inſtruct but hardly,
becauſe it moves but gently; for the
violent Paſſions not finding their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in thoſe faint emotions, begin
to rebel and fly to their old Objects,
whereas Poetry at the ſame time that
it inſtructs us powerfully, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us eaſily; becauſe it makes the
very Violence of the Paſſions contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to our Reformation: For the
generality of Mankind are apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſwayed by their Paſſions, nay, and
perhaps the very beſt and wiſeſt of
them. The greateſt Philoſophers
and the greateſt Princes are influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
by their Favourites, and ſo are
the wiſeſt Magiſtrates. And 'tis for
this reaſon that not only the Devil,
who muſt be ſuppos'd to underſtand
human nature, corrupts Mankind
by their Paſſions; (for Temptation
is nothing but the inclining Men to
ſuch and ſuch Actions, by the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0365900900:58"/>
ſuch and ſuch Paſſions in them)
but God himſelf, who made the Soul,
and beſt underſtands its nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
it by its Paſſions: For whereas
Philoſophy pretends to correct hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Paſſions by human Reaſon, that
is, things that are ſtrong and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable,
by ſomething that is feeble
and weak, Poetry by the force of the
Paſſion, inſtructs and reforms the
Reaſon; which is the Deſign of the
true Religion, as we have ſhewn in
another place. So that we have here
already laid down one great Rule,
neceſſary for the ſucceeding in Poetry:
For ſince it can attain neither
its ſubordinate nor its final End,
without exciting of Paſſion, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that where there is nothing
which directly tends to the moving
of that, there can be no Poetry; and
that conſequently, a Poet ought to
contrive every thing in order to the
moving of Paſſion, that not only the
Fable, the Incidents and Characters,
but the very Sentiments and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
ought all to be deſigned
for that: For ſince Poetry pleaſes
and inſtructs us more, even than
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0365900900:59"/>
Philoſophy it ſelf, only becauſe it
moves us more, it follows, that the
more Poetry moves, the more it
pleaſes and inſtructs; and it is for
this reaſon that Tragedy, to thoſe
who have a Taſt of it, is both more
pleaſing and more inſtructing, than
Comedy. And this naturally brings
us to the dividing Poetry into the
greater and the leſs.</p>
            <p>1. The greater Poetry is an Art
by which a Poet juſtly and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
excites great Paſſion, that he
may pleaſe and inſtruct, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
Epick, Tragick, and the
greater Lyrick Poetry.</p>
            <p>2. The leſs Poetry is an Art by
which a Poet excites leſs Paſſion for
the forementioned Ends; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in it, Comedy and Satyr, and
the little Ode, and Elegiack, and
Paſtoral Poems. But firſt we ſhall
treat of the former.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. What the greater Poetry is,
what Enthuſiaſm is.</head>
            <p>THE greater Poetry then, is an
Art by which a Poet juſtly and
reaſonably excites great Paſſion, in
order to pleaſe and inſtruct, and
make Mankind better and happier;
ſo that the firſt and grand Rule in
the greater Poetry is, that a Poet
muſt every where excite great Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but in ſome Branches of the
greater Poetry, it is impoſſible for a
Poet every where to excite in a very
great degree, that which we vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
call Paſſion: As in the Ode
for Example, and in the Narration
of the Epick Poem. It follows then
that there muſt be two ſorts of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> That which we call Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Paſſion, and <hi>Secondly,</hi> Enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Vulgar Paſſion or that
which we commonly call Paſſion,
is that which is moved by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0365900900:61"/>
themſelves, or by the Idea's
in the ordinary courſe of Life,
I mean that common Society which
we find in the World. As for
Example, Anger is moved by an
Affront that is offered us in our
preſence, or by the relation of one;
Pitty by the ſight of a mournful
Object, or the relation of one;
Admiration or Wonder, (the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Paſſion I mean, for there is
an Enthuſiaſtick Admiration, as
we ſhall find anon) by the ſight
of a ſtrange Object, or the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Enthuſiaſtick Paſſion or
Enthuſiaſm, is a Paſſion which is
moved by the Idea's in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
or the Meditation of Things,
that belong not to common Life:
Moſt of our Thoughts in Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are naturally attended with
ſome ſort and ſome degree of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and this Paſſion if it is ſtrong
I call Enthuſiaſm: Now, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick
Paſſions are chiefly Six,
Admiration, Terror, Horror, Joy,
Sadneſs, Deſire, cauſed by Idea's
occuring to us in Meditation, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0365900900:62"/>
producing the ſame Paſſions that the
Objects of thoſe Idea's would raiſe
in us, if they were ſet before us
in the ſame Light that thoſe Idea's
give us of them. And here I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Reader to obſerve, that
Idea's in Meditation, are often ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different from what Idea's of
the ſame Objects are, in the courſe
of common Converſation. As for
Example, the Sun mention'd in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Converſation, gives the Idea
of a round flat ſhining Body, of
about Two Foot Diameter. But
the Sun occurring to us in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
gives the Idea of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſt
and glorious Body, and the
top of all the viſible Creation, and
the brighteſt material Image of the
Divinity. I leave the Reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to judge, if this Idea muſt
not neceſſarily be attended with
Admiration, and that Admiration
I call Enthuſiaſm. So Thunder men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in common Converſation,
gives an Idea of a black Cloud,
and a great Noiſe, which makes
no great Impreſſion upon us. But
the Idea of it occurring in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0365900900:63"/>
ſets before us the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
moſt reſiſtleſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the moſt dreadful Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
in Nature: So that this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea
muſt move a great deal of
Terror in us, and 'tis this ſort of
Terror that I call Enthuſiaſm.
And 'tis this ſort of Terror, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
or Horror, and ſo of the
reſt, which expreſt in Poetry,
make that Spirit, that Paſſion, and
that Fire which ſo wonderfully
pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Thus there are two ſorts of
Paſſions to be rais'd in Poetry, the
Vulgar and the Enthuſiaſtick, to
which laſt, the Vulgar is prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe all Men are capable
of being moved by the Vulgar,
and a Poet writes to all: But the
Enthuſiaſtick are more ſubtle, and
Thouſands have no feeling and no
notion of them; but where the
Vulgar cannot be moved in a great
degree, there the Enthuſiaſtick are
to be rais'd. Therefore in thoſe
parts of Epick Poetry, where the
Poet ſpeaks himſelf, or the Eldeſt
of the Muſes for him, the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0365900900:64"/>
Paſſions are to prevail, as
likewiſe in the greater Ode. And
the Vulgar Paſſions are to prevail
in thoſe parts of an Epick and
Dramatick Poem, where the Poet
introduces Perſons holding Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
together. And perhaps this
might be one Reaſon, for which
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> might prefer Tragedy to
Epick Poetry, becauſe the Vulgar
Paſſions prevail more in it, and
are more violently mov'd in it,
and therefore Tragedy muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
both pleaſe, and inſtruct
more generally than Epick Poetry.
We ſhall then treat of the Vulgar
Paſſions when we come to ſpeak
of Tragedy, in which Poem they
ought moſt to prevail; We ſhall
then more particularly ſhew the
ſureſt and moſt powerful ways of
raiſing Compaſſion and Terror,
which are the true Tragical Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>We ſhall at preſent treat of the
Enthuſiaſtick Paſſions, and how
they are to be rais'd. We have
taken notice above that they are
to be mov'd by Idea's occurring
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0365900900:65"/>
in Contemplation, that they are to
be mov'd in a great degree, and
yet juſtly and reaſonably. We ſhall
now ſhew that the ſtrongeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick
Paſſions, that are juſtly
and reaſonably rais'd, muſt be rais'd
by religious Idea's, that is, by Idea's
which either ſhew the attributes of
the Divinity, or relate to his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
And this we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to prove, <hi>1ſt.</hi> by Reaſon;
<hi>2ly.</hi> by Authority; <hi>3ly.</hi> by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſhall endeavour to
prove it by Reaſon. Since the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Paſſions are to be moved in
a great Degree, and are to be
moved by their Idea's, it follows,
That to be juſtly and reaſonably
moved, they muſt be moved by
great Idea's. And therefore the
ſtronger the Enthuſiaſm is, the
greater muſt the Idea's be. Now
thoſe Idea's are certainly the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
which are worthieſt to move
the greateſt and the wiſeſt Men:
For there the Enthuſiaſtick Paſſions
in Poetry are truly admirable, when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0365900900:66"/>
the greater and more violent they
are, the more they ſhow the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Soul, and greatneſs of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of the Writer. For Men
are moved for Two Reaſons, either
becauſe they have weak Minds and
Souls, that are capable of being
moved by little Objects, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
by little and ordinary
Idea's; or becauſe they have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Soul and Capacity, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and feel the great ones; for
the Enthuſiaſtick Paſſions being
caus'd by the Idea's, it follows,
That the more the Soul is capable
of receiving Idea's whoſe Objects
are truly great and wonderful, the
greater will the Enthuſiaſm be that
is caus'd by thoſe Idea's; From
whence it follows, that the greater
the Soul is, and the larger the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
the more will it be moved
by religious Idea's; which are not
only great and wonderful, but which
almoſt alone are great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
to a great and wiſe Man;
and which never fail to move ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtrongly, unleſs it is for want
of due Reflection, or want of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
in the Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0365900900:67"/>
Since therefore the Enthuſiaſm
in the greater Poetry, is to hold
Proportion with the Idea's, and
thoſe Idea's are certainly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
which are worthieſt to move
the greateſt and the wiſeſt Men;
and Divine Idea's or Idea's which
ſhew the Attributes of God, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to his Worſhip, are worthieſt
to move the greateſt and the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
Men; becauſe ſuch Idea's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Objects which are only
truly above them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
truly Admirable, Deſirable, Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Terrible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it follows, That
the greateſt and ſtrongeſt Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm
that can be imploy'd in Poetry,
is only juſtly and reaſonably to be
derived from Religious Idea's.</p>
            <p>But here we deſire the Reader's
leave to make this Obſervation,
That ſince Religious and Divine
Idea's, or Idea's which shew the
Attributes, or relate to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Divinity, are the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt
to move the greateſt and the
wiſeſt Men; and the greater and wiſer
the Men are, the more they muſt
move and raiſe them: As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0365900900:68"/>
The greater and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
the Soul is, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
upon the Idea of God, the
more that Idea muſt fill that Soul
with Admiration; it follows, That
as great Paſſion, only is the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Language of the greater Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry;
ſo the greater Poetry, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the adequate Language of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and that therefore the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Paſſion, is the Language of that
ſort of Poetry; becauſe that ſort
of Poetry is the worthieſt Language
of Religion.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhall proceed
to prove by Authority, That the
ſtrongeſt Enthuſiaſtick Paſſions in
Poetry, are only juſtly and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to be rais'd by Religious I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's:
And this we ſhall ſhow by
the Authority of the greateſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
among the Antients, <hi>Ariſtotle,
Hermogenes,</hi> and <hi>Longinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, in the third
Book of his Rhetorick, <hi>Cap.</hi> II. and
III. That the frequent uſe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,
Dialects, Epithets, is a
great deal fitter for Poetry than it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0365900900:69"/>
is for Proſe, becauſe they are the
Language of Paſſion, and Poetry
is more Paſſionate or more Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick
than Proſe, for this Reaſon,
becauſe the Perſons and the Things
of which Poetry treats, are many
degrees above thoſe which are the
Subjects of Proſe. Now all the
World knows that the Graecians,
treated of the greateſt Human Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Things in their Proſe, but
that Poetry was a Language which
they reſerv'd for their Gods, and for
the Things which related to them.
And I am apt to believe, that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry
from hence was called, the
Language of the Gods, becauſe when
ever the Graecians in the Poetical
times, introduc'd their God's Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they were ſure to ſpeak in
Verſe. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> in the VI.
Chapter of the Firſt Book of his
Treatiſe, concerning the Forms of
Speech, tells us, That there are
Four kind of Thoughts or Idea's,
or Conceptions, which were proper
to give that elevation and gravity
to a Diſcourſe, which by their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0365900900:70"/>
compoſe that quality in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
which we call Majeſty.</p>
            <p>1. The Firſt and Principal of them
are, all ſuch Thoughts or Idea's of
God, as are worthy of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
not like ſome of the Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Conceptions of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which
ſays <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> being more Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
than Divine, and unworthy of
the Divinity, are contrary to true
Majeſty.</p>
            <p>2. Next to theſe the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which give Elevation and
Gravity, and conſequently Majeſty
to a Diſcourſe, are ſuch Thoughts
or Idea's concerning the Works of
God, as are worthy the Divine
Workmanſhip.</p>
            <p>3. The Third ſort of Conceptions
are, of ſuch Things as are indeed
themſelves Divine, but they are
ſuch Emanations of Divinity, as
are to be ſeen in Men, as Juſtice,
Temperance, Fortitude, Nature,
Law and the like, to which may
be added, Number, Power and
Might.</p>
            <p>4. The Fourth ſort are, of Things
that indeed are Human, but are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0365900900:71"/>
reputed Great and Illuſtrious, as,
Conqueſt, Riches, Nobility, Place,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here I deſire the Reader
to obſerve, That <hi>Hermogenes</hi> is here
ſpeaking concerning Peices of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and ſuch Diſcourſes as are
writ in Proſe; for it is certain,
that theſe laſt Idea's as they are
of Things that are meerly Human,
can never afford the greateſt Spirit
that can be imploy'd in Poetry.
For as the Objects themſelves are
not truly great, becauſe, as <hi>Longinuus</hi>
ſays, A Man who has it in his
Power to poſſeſs them, ſhows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Great by contemning them:
It is impoſſible that a Spirit that is
very great, can flow from theſe
Idea's, becauſe the Spirit that is
very great, muſt hold proportion
with its Idea's, as the Idea's muſt
with their Objects; and therefore
theſe Idea's cannot be great, becauſe
their Objects are not great. We
ought now in the <hi>Third</hi> Place, to
proceed to the Authority of <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
But that we may Diverſifie
this Treatiſe the more, and make
it the more entertaining, we ſhall
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0365900900:72"/>
firſt ſhew Examples of the ſeveral
kinds of the foremention'd Thoughts,
producing that ſort of Spirit in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry
which we call Enthuſiaſtick
Admiration, and that we may ſhow
the Reader more plainly how that
Spirit is produc'd, we ſhall ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him as near as we can, ſuch
kind of Thoughts as inſpire the
Soul with Admiration alone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complicated
with Terror, or any
other Paſſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Thoughts, or Idea's, which
produce that Enthuſiaſm which we
call Admiration, are Thoughts or
Idea's which hold ſome proportion
with ſuch Objects, as in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are truly admirable. Thoſe
Thoughts or Idea's are of Two
ſorts, Idea's of Sounds, and Idea's
of Things. We ſhall then have
occaſion to treat of Idea's of Sounds,
when we come to ſpeak of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and ſome of the other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick
Paſſions; we ſhall at
preſent treat of ſuch Idea's of
Things,, as are proper to excite
Admiration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0365900900:73"/>
We have ſhown that <hi>Hermoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
in the firſt Rank of theſe,
reckons thoſe Thoughts and Idea's
of God, that are worthy of the
Creator: Such is the Invocation of
<hi>Milton,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0365900900:74"/>
Spirit, the Reader who goes back
to the beginning of the Poem, will
find no manner of room to doubt.
For <hi>Milton,</hi> like a Maſter, begins
with a gentle Spirit, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
for the Twelve firſt Lines:
In the Thirteenth where he ſpeaks
of the boldneſs of his Attempt, he
begins to riſe; and in the Nineteenth,
where he talks of the Power of the
Holy Ghoſt, he is quite upon the
Wing.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Inſtruct me, for Thou know'ſt, Thou from the firſt.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And ſuch are the Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God, which are ſpread thro'
that Divine Dialogue, between God
and <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Eighth Book of
the ſame Poem; I believe the
Reader, will pardon the length if
I repeat it, which I am very much
inclin'd to do, not only becauſe I
challenge the moſt zealous admirers
of Antiquity, to produce any thing
like it, from among all the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> that are
between either a God or a Man, or
between one God and another:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0365900900:75"/>
But becauſe the Reader who ſees
the inequalities in it, will eaſily
ſee that it derives its greatneſs and
its ſublimity, from the becoming
Thoughts which it has of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
That the Reader may through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtand it, without turning
to the Book, the occaſion of it is
this. <hi>Adam,</hi> relating the Hiſtory
of the Creation to the Angel <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi>
tells him, how after he had
given Names to the Birds and the
Beaſts, which God had brought
before him for that purpoſe; he
who underſtood their Natures, and
ſaw none of them was fit for his
Converſation, deſir'd of God in the
following Words, a Partner fit for
Humane Society.</p>
            <q>
               <l>O by what Name, for Thou above all theſe,</l>

            <p>Here by the way, I deſire the

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0365900900:82"/>
needleſs, for what has been
ſaid, may ſuffice to ſhow that a Poet
who intends: to give that Elevation,
and that Gravity to his Poem;
which Compoſe Majeſty can fetch
his Ideas from no Object ſo proper
as from God. For as great Elevation
muſt be produced by a great Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as every Paſſion which the
Poet excites, ought to be juſt and
Reaſonable, and Adapted to its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it is impoſſible that any one,
who is not ſtupid, can ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
his Maker, but that his
Soul muſt be exalted and lifted up
towards its Primitive Objects, and be
fill'd and inſpired with the higheſt
Admiration. For 'tis then that the
Enthuſiaſm in Poetry is Wonderful
and Divine, when it ſhows the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
of the Authors diſcernment,
and the largeneſs of his Soul; now
all the Ideas of God are ſuch, that
the more large and comprehenſive
the Soul of a Poet is; and the more
it is capable of Receiving thoſe Idea's
the more is it ſure to be raiſed and
fill'd and lifted to the Skies with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
The Spirit or the Paſſion in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0365900900:83"/>
Poetry ought to be proportioned to
the Ideas, and the Ideas to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and when it is not ſo it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
falſe. And therefore when ever
in Poetry there is a great Spirit
which is derived from Ideas, whoſe
Objects are unworthy to move the
Soul of a great and a wise Man,
there that Spirit is either falſe
or at leaſt has nothing ſublimely,
admirable in it. But nothing but
God, and what relates to God,
is worthy to move the Soul of a
great and a wiſe Man. But let us
proceed to conſider the glorious
works of the Creator, which next to
Himſelf are worthy to move with
Admiration, all who are worthy to be
called wise, becauſe theſe when they
are reflected upon, by the Great and
the Wise, never fail to declare his
Eternal Power and Godhead. Our
Religion tells us that the firſt,
the Greateſt and moſt Glorious of
His works are the Angels, who whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we conſider their Power, their
Swiftneſs, their Science, or their
Sanctity, are fit Objects of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and Conſequently of Lofty
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0365900900:84"/>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Wonders of the

Ideas and a more admirable
Spirit, the more they ſhew the
attributes of the Creator or relate
to his Worſhip. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That
Na ural Philoſophy is abſolutely
neceſſary to a Poet, not only that
he may adorn his Poem, with the
uſeful knowledge it affords, but
becauſe the more he knows the
immenſe Phaenomena of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
the more he will be ſure to
admire them. For the more we
know of Things that are never to
be comprehended by us, the more
that knowledge muſt make them
appear wonderful. The <hi>Third</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
that I ſhall make is this,
That they to whom Nature has
given that happy Elevation of
Thought, which alone can make
a great Poet, will often be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by that tendency to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which they have within them
to Ideas, from which they may

ſhew by the Example of <hi>Milton,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0365900900:99"/>
that they may often very groſly
fail, for want of a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Objects from which
they are to draw their Idea's, for
'tis for want of that knowledge
that <hi>Milton</hi> has done the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artful
thing that perhaps ever was
done, in the two or three laſt Books
of the greateſt Poem that ever was
written by Man. For whereas in
the Firſt Eight Books, he had by
the Mouth of God or Angels, or of
Man the Companion of Angels,
divinely entertain'd us with the
wondrous Works of God, in the
latter end of his Poem, and more
particularly in the laſt Book, he
makes an Angel entertain us with

            <p>The Late Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> with a

the flatneſs of <hi>Milton,</hi> in this

            </q>
            <p>'Tis eaſie to diſcern here, with
how much more Divinity <hi>Milton</hi>
makes a Man ſpeak concerning the
Works of God, than he makes even
the Creator Himſelf ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Works of Man. But here
if the Reader will pardon a Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
I ſhall make an Obſervation
which may not be diſagreeable to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0365900900:105"/>
him. The Obſervation is this, That
all the Paſſages in Paradiſe Loſt,
where God is introduc'd Speaking,
are flat to the reſerve of thoſe in
which he ſpeaks of himſelf. Upon
enquiring into the Reaſon of it, I
found, That according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which I have given of Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Enthuſiaſm, or of the Spirit of
Poetry, it is nothing but that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and Terrour, and the reſt
of thoſe Enthuſiaſtical Paſſions which
are produced by their proper Ideas,
and which are to hold Proportion
with their Ideas, as their Ideas, muſt
with their Objects. Now nothing
is more impoſſible than that God
ſhould either Fear or Admire His
own Creatures. But where <hi>Milton</hi>
makes him ſpeak concerning Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or His Infinite Power, there
he makes him ſpeak with a great
Spirit, as in that Paſſage of the
Sixth Book where He ſpeaks to
His Son.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Go then thou mightieſt in thy Father's Might</l>
               <l>Aſcend My Chariot, guide the rapid Wheels,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0365900900:106"/>
That ſhake Heaven's Baſis, bring forth all my War,</l>
               <l>My Bow and Thunder, My Almighty Arms.</l>
            </q>
            <p>'Tis plain that here the Poet is
guilty of a Miſtake, but indeed a
Miſtake that is almoſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for 'tis the Admiration and
Terrour that make the Spirit in
the preceding Verſes; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to conceive the Ideas with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feeling the Paſſions; ſo that
<hi>Milton</hi> while he was rapt with
Admiration and moved with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
by the Ideas which he had
conceiv'd, ſhifts Perſons inſenſibly,
and forgetting who ſpeaks, expreſſes
himſelf with thoſe Paſſions which
indeed are proper enough in the
Poet, but never can be ſo in the
Deity. For neither His Bow, nor
His Almighty Arms, His Thunder,
nor the rapid Wheels that Shake
Heavens baſis, can be in the leaſt
Admirable or Terrible to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
ſo that Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the right in his Notes upon
his <hi>Davideis,</hi> where he tells us, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0365900900:107"/>
God is to be introduc'd ſpeaking
ſimply. And this puts me in mind
of an extraordinary Argument of
Monſieur <hi>Paſchal,</hi> proving the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of our Saviour by the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of his Stile; for ſays he, our
Saviour ſpeaks of the ſublimeſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
even the glories of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven without being
moved at all, which ſhews that
he was really God; for ſuppoſe a
Peaſant, ſays he, or an ordinary
Man ſhou'd be carried to the
Court of ſome Prince, as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
the great Mogul, and there
be ſhewn all his Riches, his Pomp
and his Power; this Peaſant at his
return would certainly ſpeak of
theſe Things in extravagant terms,
in terms that would ſufficiently
declare his tranſport. But if the
Mogul himſelf was to ſpeak of them,
he who had been always us;d to
them, would ſpeak without any
emotion. So ſays Monſieur <hi>Paſchal,</hi>
if any one elſe had deliver'd any
Thing concerning the glories of the
Kingdom of Heaven, he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have done it with tranſport,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0365900900:108"/>
nay tho' he had been a Fanatick
or an Impoſtor; For let thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ideas come how they will,
'tis Impoſſible for Man to think of
them without being Raviſh'd by
them. But our Saviour who was
God, and who conſequently had
been us'd to them from all Eternity,
ſpoke of them unconcern'd.</p>
            <p>But let us come to the <hi>Third</hi>
sort of Thoughts, which <hi>Hermogenes</hi>
ſays, are proper to give Elevation
and Gravity to a Diſcourſe, and
thoſe are Things which indeed are
Divine, ſays, but are often beheld
in Men. Theſe Emanations of
Divinity are the Virtues ſuch as
Temperance, Juſtice, Fortitude,
Magnanimity; or Nature, Law,
Power and the like. And we
ſhou'd never make an end, if we
ſhou'd give Examples of all the
Paſſages, whoſe greatneſs of Spirit,
is deriv'd from theſe Ideas. But
for the Readers Entertainment we
ſhall mention a few.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0365900900:109"/>
The Power of Ruling our own
Minds, which may be referr'd to
Temperance, gives noble Ideas and
conſequently a noble Spirit, as we
may ſee by the Second Ode, of the
Second Book of <hi>Horace.</hi>

            </q>

            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> sort of Thoughts
which <hi>Hermogenes</hi> mentions, as Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Nobility, Place, Office, Rank,
and the like, we ſhall purpoſely
paſs by, without giving Examples
of them, becauſe we ſhall have
a particular occaſion to do it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Let us now paſs to the next
Enthuſiaſtick Paſſion which is Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
than which if it is rightly
manag'd, none is more capable of
giving a great Spirit to Poetry.
This Paſſion ſcarce ever goes by it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0365900900:114"/>
but is always more or leſs
complicated with Admiration. For
every thing that is Terrible is great
at leaſt to him to whom it is Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.
'Tis now our buſineſs to ſhew
two Things. Firſt, what this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick
Terrour is? and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from what Ideas it is chiefly to
be deriv'd.</p>
            <p>Firſt let us ſhow what this ſort of
Enthuſiaſm is, and in order to that,
let us ſhew as briefly as we can,
what the Common Paſſion is
which we call Terror. Fear then
or Terror is, a Diſturbance of Mind
proceeding from the apprehenſion
of an approaching evil; Threatning
Diſtruction or very great trouble
either to us or ours. And when
the diſturbance comes ſuddenly
with ſurpriſe, let us call it Terror,
when gradually Fear. Things then
that are powerful, and likely to
hurt, are the cauſes of Common
Terror, and the more they are
powerful and likely to hurt, the
more they become the cauſes of
Terror, which Terror, the greater
it is, the more it is join'd with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0365900900:115"/>
wonder, and the nearer it comes
to aſtoniſhment. Thus we have
ſhewn what Objects of the Mind
are the cauſes of Common Terror,
and the Ideas of thoſe Objects are
the cauſes of Enthuſiaſtick Terror.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſhew from what
Ideas this Enthuſiaſtick Terror is
chiefly to be deriv'd. The greateſt
Enthuſiaſtick Terrour then muſt
needs be deriv'd from Religious
Idea's, for ſince the more their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are Powerful, and likely to
hurt, the greater Terrour their
Idea's produce: What can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a greater Terrour than the
Idea of an Angry God? Which puts
me in mind of that admirable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of <hi>Homer,</hi> about the Fight of
the Gods, in the Twentieth of the
Iliads, cited by <hi>Longinus</hi> in his
Chapter of the Loftineſs of the
Conceptions.</p>

            <p>I now come to the Precepts of
<hi>Longinus,</hi> and pretend to ſhew from
them, that the greateſt ſublimity is
to be deriv'd from Religious Ideas.
But why then, ſays the Reader, has
not <hi>Longinus</hi> plainly told us ſo? He
was not ignorant, that he ought to
make his ſubject as plain as he
could. For he has told us in the
beginning of his Treatiſe, that every
one who gives Inſtruction concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0365900900:122"/>
an Art, ought to endeavour
two things. The firſt is to make
his Reader clearly underſtand what
that is which he pretends to teach.
The ſecond is to ſhew him how it
may be attain'd. And he blames
<hi>Cecilius</hi> very ſeverely for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Laſt, how then ſays the
Objector comes he himſelf to have
taken no care of the Firſt: Is it
becauſe <hi>Cecilius</hi> had done it before
him? If ſo, it was a very great
fault in <hi>Longinus,</hi> to publiſh a Book
which cou'd not be underſtood but
by another Man's Writings; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when he ſaw that thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
were ſo very defective that
they would not probably laſt. But
what, continues the Objector, if
<hi>Cecilius</hi> had not done it before
him? For <hi>Longinus</hi> tells us that
<hi>Cecilius</hi> makes uſe of a multitude
of Words to ſhew what it is;
now he who knows any thing clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may in a few Words explain it
clearly to others; and he who does
not will make it obſcure by many.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that tho' <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi>
did by long Study, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0365900900:123"/>
know the Sublime when he
ſaw it, as well as any Man, yet
he had not ſo clear a knowledge of
the Nature of it as to explain it
clearly to others. For if he had
done that, as the Objector ſays,
he would have defin'd it, but he
has been ſo far from defining it,
that in one place he has given an
account of it that is contrary to
the true nature of it. For he tells
us in that Chapter which treats
of the Fountains of Sublimity, that
Loftineſs is often without any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at all. Which is contrary to
to the true nature of it. The ſublime
is indeed often without Common Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
as ordinary Paſſion is often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that. But then it is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Enthuſiaſtick Paſſion. For the
Sublime is nothing elſe but a great
Thought, or Great Thoughts mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Soul from it's Ordinary
Scituation by the Enthuſiaſm which
naturally attends them. Now <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi>
had a notion of Enthuſiaſtick
Paſſion; for he eſtabliſhes it in that,
very Chapter for the ſecond Source
of Sublimity. Now <hi>Longinus</hi> by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0365900900:124"/>
affirming that the Sublime may be
without not only that, but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Paſſion, ſays a thing that is not
only contrary to the true Nature
of it, but contradictory of Himſelf.
For he tells us in the beginning of
the Treatiſe that the Sublime does
not ſo properly perſuade us, as it Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes
and Tranſports us, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
in us a certain Admiration
mingled with aſtoniſhment and
with ſurpriſe, which is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing than the barely Pleaſing
or the barely perſwading; that it
gives a noble Vigour to a Diſcourſe,
an invincible force which commits a
pleaſing Rape upon the very Soul
of the Reader; that whenever it
breaks out where it ought to do,
like the Artillery of <hi>Jove,</hi> it Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
blazes and ſtrikes at once,
and ſhews all the united force of a
Writer. Now I leave the Reader to
Judge, whether <hi>Longinius</hi> has not
been ſaying here all along that Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
is never without Paſſion.</p>
            <p>That the foremention'd Diſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is juſt and good, I have reaſon
to believe, becauſe it takes in all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0365900900:125"/>
the ſources of Sublimity which <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi>
has eſtabliſh'd. For firſt
greatneſs of Thought ſuppoſes Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
they, being Synonimous
Terms: And ſecondly the Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm
or the Pathetique, as <hi>Longinus</hi>
calls it, follows of courſe; for if a
Man is not ſtrongly mov'd by great
Thoughts, he does not ſufficiently
and effectually conceive them. And
thirdly the Figurative-Language is
but a conſequence of the Enthuſiaſm,
that being the natural Language of
the Paſſions. And ſo is fourthly the
nobleneſs of the Expreſſion, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a Man to be Maſter of the
Language in which he Writes.
For as the Thoughts produce the
Spirit or the Paſſion, the Spirit
produces and makes the Expreſſion,
which is known by experience to
all who are Poets; for never any
one, while he was rapt with Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm
or Ordinary Paſſion, wanted
either Words or Harmony, and is
ſelf evident to all who conſider
that the expreſſion conveys and
ſhows the Spirit, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
muſt be produc'd by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0365900900:126"/>
Thus the definition which we
have laid down, being according
to <hi>Longinus</hi> his own Doctrine, the
true definition of the Sublime, and
ſhewing clearly the thing which he
has not done, nor given any defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all of it, it ſeems plain to
me, that he had no clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Idea of it; and conſequently
Religion might be the thing from
which it is chiefly to be deriv'd
and he but obſcurely know it;
but that Religion is that thing
from which the Sublime is chiefly
to be deriv'd, let us ſhew by the
Marks which he has given of the
latter; which will further ſtrengthen
our Definition. Firſt, ſays he, that
which is truely ſublime has this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to it, that it exalts the
Soul and makes it conceive a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Idea of it ſelf; filling it with
Joy, and with a certain noble Pride,
as if it ſelf had produc'd what it but
barely Reads.</p>
            <p>Now here it is plain, that the
higheſt Ideas muſt moſt exalt the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0365900900:127"/>
Soul, but Religious Ideas are the
higheſt.</p>
            <p>The more the Soul is mov'd by
the greateſt Ideas, the more it
conceives them, but the more it
conceives of the greateſt Ideas, the
greater Opinion it muſt have of its
own Capacity. By conſequence the
more it is mov'd by the Wonders of
Religion the more it values it ſelf
upon its own Excellences. Again,
The more the Soul ſees its Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the more it Rejoyces. Beſides
Religious Ideas are the moſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
and what is moſt Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
according to the Doctrine of
<hi>Ariſtrotle</hi> is moſt delightful. Beſides
Religious Ideas create Paſſion in
ſuch a manner as to turn and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Soul to its primitive Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
So that Reaſon and Paſſion
are of the ſame ſide, and this Peace
between the Faculties cauſes the
Soul to Rejoyce, of which we
ſhall have occaſion to ſay more
anon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0365900900:128"/>
2. The Second Mark that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi>
gives of the Sublime, is when
a Diſcourſe leaves a great deal for
us to think. But now this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the wonders of Religion
are never to be exhauſted, for they
are always new, and the more you
enter into them, the more they are
ſure to ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p>3. The Third Mark is, when it
leaves in the Reader an Idea above
its Expreſſion. Now no Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
can come up to the Ideas
which we draw from the Atri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God, or from His won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
Works, which only the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of them can comprehend.</p>
            <p>4. The Fourth Mark is, when it
makes an impreſſion upon us, which
it is impoſſible to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>God who made Man for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and for his own Glory, and
who requires chiefly his Heart; muſt
by conſequence have form'd him
of ſuch a Nature as to be moſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0365900900:129"/>
ſtrongly mov'd with Religious Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if once he enters into them.
So that the Impreſſions which they
make are Impoſſible to be Reſiſted.</p>
            <p>5. The Fifth Mark is when the
Impreſſion laſts and is difficult to
be defac'd. Now that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
which Religion makes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us are difficult to be defac'd is
plain from this, that they who
think it their Intereſt to deface
them can never bring it about.</p>
            <p>6. The Sixth Mark is when it
pleaſes univerſally, people of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Humours, Inclinations, Sexes,
Ages, Times, Climates. Now there
is nothing ſo agreeable to the Soul
or that makes ſo univerſal an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
as the wonders of Religion.
Some Perſons are mov'd by Love
and are not touch'd by Ambition,
others are animated by Ambition
and only Laugh at Love. Some
are pleas'd with a brave Revenge,
others with a generous Contempt of
Injuries, but the Eternal Power and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0365900900:130"/>
the Infinite knowledge of God, the
Wonders of the Creation, and the
beautiful brightneſs of Virtue make
a powerful impreſſion on all.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs I have wonder'd
very much upon Reflection, how it
could happen that ſo great a Man
as <hi>Longinus,</hi> who whenever he met
a paſſage in any Diſcourſe that
was lofty enough to pleaſe him,
had diſcernment enough to ſee that
it had ſome of the preceeding Marks,
ſhould miſs of finding ſo eaſie a
thing as this, that never any paſſage
had all theſe Marks or ſo much as
the Majority of them, unleſs it
were Religious.</p>
            <p>But to return to Terrour, we
may plainly ſee by the foregoing
Precepts and Examples of <hi>Longinus,</hi>
that this Enthuſiaſtick Terror con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
extreamly to the Sublime,
and Secondly that it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by Religious Ideas.</p>
            <p>Firſt Ideas producing Terrour
contribute extreamly to the Sublime.
All the Examples that <hi>Longinus</hi>
brings of the loftineſs of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0365900900:131"/>
Thought, conſiſt of terrible Ideas.
And they are Principally ſuch Ideas
that work the effects, which he
takes notice of, in the beginning of
his Treatiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that Raviſh and
Tranſport the Reader, and produce
a certain Admiration mingled with
Aſtoniſhment and with Surprize.
For the Ideas which produce Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
are neceſſarily accompanied
with Admiration, becauſe ev'ry
thing that is terrible is great to Him
to whom it is Terrible; and with
Surprize without which Terrour
cannot ſubſiſt; and with Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe ev'ry thing which is
very Terrible is Wonderful and
Aſtoniſhing; and as Terrour is
perhaps the violent'ſt of all the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it conſequently makes an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
which we cannot reſiſt, and
which is hardly to be defac'd, and
no Paſſion is attended with greater
Joy than Enthuſiaſtick Terrour,
which proceeds from our reflecting
that we are out of Danger at the
very time that we ſee it before us.
And as Terrour is one of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0365900900:132"/>
lenteſt of all Paſſions if it is very
great, and the hardeſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
nothing gives more force, nor
more vehemence to a Diſcourſe.
But Secondly, it is plain from the
ſame <hi>Longinus,</hi> that this Enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Terrour is chiefly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from Religious Ideas. For
all the Examples which he has
brought of the Sublime, in his
Chapter of the Sublimity of the
Thoughts conſiſts of moſt Terrible
and moſt Religious Ideas, and at
the ſame time ev'ry Man's Reaſon
will inform him, that ev'ry thing
that is Terrible in Religion is the
moſt Terrible thing in the World.</p>
            <p>But that we may ſet this in a
clearer Light, let us lay before the
Reader the ſeveral Ideas which
are capable of producing this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick
Terrour, which ſeem to
me to be thoſe which follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
Gods, Daemons, Hell, Spirits and
Souls of Men, Miracles, Prodigies,
Enchantments, Witchcrafts, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Tempeſts, raging Seas, Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
Torrents, Earthquakes,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0365900900:133"/>
Volcanos, Monſters, Serpents, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Tygres, Fire, War, Peſtilence,
Famine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of all theſe Ideas none are
ſo terrible as thoſe which ſhew
the Wrath and Vengeance of an
Angry God. For nothing is ſo
wonderful in its effects, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Images or Ideas of thoſe
effects muſt carry a great deal of
Terrour with them, which we
may ſee was <hi>Longinus</hi> his Opinion
by the Examples which he brings
in his Chapter of the Sublimity of
the Thoughts. Now of things which
are terrible thoſe are the moſt terrible
which are the moſt wonderful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that ſeeing them both threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and powerful, and not being
able to fathom the greatneſs and
extent of their Power, we know
not how far and how ſoon they
may hurt us.</p>
            <p>But further nothing is ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as the wrath of infinite Power,
becauſe nothing is ſo unavoidable
as the Vengeance deſign'd by it.
There is no flying nor lying hid
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0365900900:134"/>
from the great univerſal Monarch.
He may deliver us from all other
Terrours, but nothing can ſave
and defend us from him. And
therefore Reaſon which ſerves to
diſſipate our Terrours in ſome other
Dangers, ſerves but to augment
them when we are threatned by
Infinite Power; and that Fortitude
which may be Heroick at other
times is down right madneſs then.</p>
            <p>For the other Ideas which we
mention'd above, they will be
found to be more terrible as they
have more of Religion in them.
But we ſhall have ſo many neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
occaſions of giving Examples
of them, in the Sequel of this
Treatiſe, that it will be altogether
needleſs to do it now. But here it
will be convenient to Anſwer an
Objection. For how come ſome
of the foremention'd Ideas which
ſeem to have but little to do with
Religion, to be Terrible to great
and to wiſe Men, as it is plain that
ſuch when they read the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi>
are terrify'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0365900900:135"/>
To which we Anſwer, that the
care which Nature has inrooted in
all of their own Preſervation, is the
Cauſe that Men are unavoidably
terrify'd, with any thing that
threatens approaching evil. 'Tis
now our buſineſs to ſhew how
the Ideas of Serpents, Lions, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
&amp;c. were made by the art
of thoſe great Poets, to be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their Readers at the ſame
time that we are ſecure from their
Objects.</p>
            <p>'Tis very plain that it is the
Apprehenſion of Danger which
cauſes that emotion in us which
we call Terrour, and it ſignifies
nothing at all to the purpoſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Danger is real or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
and 'tis as plain too, that
the Soul never takes the Alarm
from any thing ſo ſoon as it does
from the Senſes, eſpecially thoſe two
noble ones of the Eye and the Ear,
by reaſon of the ſtrict aſſinity
which they have with the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and the Evil always ſeems
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0365900900:136"/>
to be very near, when thoſe two
Senſes give notice of it; and the
nearer the Evil is the greater
ſtill is the Terror. But now let
us ſee how thoſe two Poets, did
by Virtue of their Ideas, bring even
abſent, Terrible Objects, within the
reach of thoſe two noble Senſes.
Firſt then to bring an abſent Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Object before our Sight, they
drew an Image or Picture of it;
but to draw an Image or Picture
of a Terrible Object, ſo as to
ſurpriſe and aſtoniſh the Soul by
the Eye, they never fail'd to draw
it in violent Action or Motion;
and in Order to that they made
choice of Words and Numbers,
which might beſt expreſs the violence
of that Action or Motion. For an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Object can never be ſet before
the Eye in a true Light, unleſs it
is ſhewn in violent Action or Motion.
Becauſe unleſs it is ſhewn ſo, the
Soul has leiſure to reflect upon the
Deceit. But violent Motion can
never be conceived without a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
agitation of Spirit, and that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0365900900:137"/>
ſudden agitation ſurptiſes the Soul
and gives it leſs time to Reflect;
and at the ſame time cauſes the
Impreſſions that the Objects make
to be ſo Deep, and their traces to
be ſo profound, that it makes them
in a manner as preſent to us as if
they were really before us. For
the Spirits being ſet in a violent
emotion, and the Imagination being
fir'd by that agitation; and the
Brain being deeply penetrated by
thoſe Impreſſions, the very Objects
themſelves are ſet as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, and conſequently we are
ſenſible of the ſame Paſſion that
we ſhould feel from the things
themſelves. For the warmer the
Imagination is, the leſs able we
are to Reflect, and conſequently
the things are the more preſent
to us of which we draw the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and therefore when the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
is ſo inflam'd as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Soul utterly incapable of
reflecting there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Images and the things
themſelves; as we may ſee for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0365900900:138"/>
by Men in Raging Feavours.
But thoſe two great Poets were not
ſatisfied with ſetting abſent Objects
before our Eyes, by ſhewing them
in violent motion; but if their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
occaſion'd any Extraordinary
Sounds that were terrifying; they
ſo contriv'd their Numbers and
Expreſſions, as that they might be
ſure to ring thoſe ſounds in the
very Ears of their Readers.</p>
            <p>We ought now to treat of the
other Enthuſiaſtic Paſſions, as Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
Grief, Joy and Deſire. But to
the End that we may Diverſifie this
Treatiſe as much as we can, and
not tire out the Reader with too
much Speculation at a time, we
ſhall omit ſpeaking of them till we
come to the Epick Poets.</p>

of the greater Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</head>
            <p>BUT now let us Recapitulate:
We have ſhewn in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
part of this Diſcourſe, that
Paſſion is the Characteriſtical Mark
of Poetry, and that all Poetry is
pathetick; and then we divided it
into two Kinds, the greater and the
leſs; and ſhew'd that the greater
Poetry, comprehends Epick, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
and the greater Lyrick; and
that our Deſign was in the firſt
place to treat of that. Then we
proceeded to ſhew, that as Paſſion
is the Characteriſtical Mark of
Poetry, great Paſſion muſt be the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0365900900:140"/>
Characteriſtical Mark of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Poetry, and conſequently that
this laſt muſt have every where
great Paſſion; but that ſince what
we commonly call Paſſion cannot
be ev'ry where, there muſt be
ſomething diſtinct from ordinary
Paſſion, and that muſt be Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm.
Then we endeavour'd to
diſcover what Enthuſiaſm is, and
how many ſeveral ſorts there are
of it; and that Admiration and
Terrour make the Principal great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Poetry, and are the chief
of the Enthuſiaſtick Paſſions; that
thoſe two Paſſions are to bear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with the Ideas from which
they are deriv'd, and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the greateſt muſt flow
from Religious Ideas. We ſhall
ſhew too in the Sequel of this
Diſcourſe, that not only the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Enthuſiaſtick Paſſions, Horror,
Sadneſs, Joy and Deſire; but that
ev'n the Ordinary Paſſions which
contribute moſt to the greatneſs
of Poetry as Admiration, Terrour
and Pitty are chiefly to be deriv'd
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0365900900:141"/>
from Religion; but that the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of both ſorts, muſt for the
moſt part flow greater from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
than from Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
becauſe all Reveal'd Religion
whether true or pretended ſpeaks to
the Senſes, brings the wonders of
another World more Home to us,
and ſo makes the Paſſions which it
Raiſes the greater.</p>
            <p>The Fundamental Rule then that
we pretend to lay down, for the
Succeeding, or Excelling in the
greater Poetry, is that the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Poem, be Religious that
it may be throughout Pathetick.</p>
            <p>And we pretend to prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably
that not only the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whoſe works we deſign to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
have ſucceeded and excell'd
no further than their Poems have
been ſo conſtituted; but that never
any Poets of any Nation or any
Age, ever did or can excel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. I have already prov'd in
the Advancement of modern Poetry,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0365900900:142"/>
beyond all manner of doubt, to thoſe
who have Capacity enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Arguments, that the
Ancient Poets excell'd the moderns
in the greatneſs of Poetry, for no
other reaſon, but becauſe their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
were Religious in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
And therefore all that I
ſhall ſay of it here is, that Poetry
is the Natural Language of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and that Religion at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
it, as a Cauſe produces its
Effect. In the firſt Ages of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
among the Graecians, there was
nothing writ but Verſe, becauſe
they wrote of nothing but Religion
which was neceſſary for the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
the Societies which in thoſe
times were but juſt united, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had taught them, that Poetry
was the only Language in which
they could worthily treat of the
moſt Important parts of Religion,
or worthily perform its moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Duties: But as ſoon as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was ſufficiently imprinted in
the Minds of Men, and they had
jeiſure to Treat of Human things
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0365900900:143"/>
in their writings they, invented
Proſe, and invented it in Imitation
of Verſe, as <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us in the
firſt Book of his Geography; but
after that Proſe was invented, by
them; never any of them treated
of their Gods or their Religious
matters, in Proſe, before the Age
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> becauſe they found that
that way of writing, was by no
means proper for it. For the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Religion naturally threw them
upon great Paſſions, and great paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
naturally threw them upon
Harmony, and Figurative Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
as they moſt of Neceſſity
do, any Poet as long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
Maſter of them. Which is
known by Experience to all who
are Poets, for never any one while
he was rapt with Enthuſiaſm or
with Ordinary Paſſion, wanted
either Words or Harmony, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Poetry is more Harmonious
than Proſe becauſe it is more Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick.
Even in Proſe your Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and all who pretend to move
the Paſſions, have more Harmonious
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0365900900:144"/>
Periods than they who barely ſpeak
to the Reaſon. And in Poetry they
who write with a great deal of
Paſſion are Generally very Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
whereas thoſe who write
with but little are not ſo Muſical.
<hi>Horace</hi> is an Illuſtrious Example of
this. No Man who has read his
Odes can doubt of the fineneſs and
the Delicacy of his Ear; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Satyrs are often Harſh and
Rugged becauſe the Spirit in them
is mean and little. No Man can
believe that <hi>Juvenal</hi> had a finer
Ear, than <hi>Horace,</hi> but yet his Satyrs
are more Muſical becauſe they have
a greater Spirit in them. At the
ſame time tis a little odd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that Paſſion which diſturbs the
Soul, ſhould occaſion it to produce
Harmony, which ſeems to emply
the Order and Compoſure of it.
Whether this proceeds from the
Secret Effort that the Soul makes, to
Compoſe it ſelf or whatever the
cauſe is, the Effect is certain. But
as Paſſion, which is the Diſorder of
the Soul; produces Harmony which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0365900900:145"/>
is Agreement; ſo Harmony which
is Concord Augments and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
Paſſion which is Diſcord. All
who are acquainted with Poetry
or Muſick muſt be as ſenſible of
this, as Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> was fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of it,
<q>
                  <l>Well ſounding Verſes are the Charm we uſe,</l>
                  <l>Heroick Thoughts and Virtue to infuſe;</l>
                  <l>Things of deep Senſe we may in Proſe unfold,</l>
                  <l>But they move more in lofty Numbers told;</l>
                  <l>By the loud Trumpet which our Courage aids,</l>
                  <l>We learn that Sound as well as Senſe perſuades.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we may ſee by Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>
that Numbers are proper to move
Paſſion, and for that Reaſon are
inſeperable from Poetry which has
no other Deſign. But we ſhall
have occaſion to treat of Harmony
more at large when we come to
the particular ſorts of Poems, in the
mean time let us Return to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
from which we may ſeem to
have digreſs'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0365900900:146"/>
As we have formerly undeniably
prov'd in the advancement of
Modern Poetry, that the Ancient
Poets deriv'd that Advantage which
they have over the Moderns to the
conſtituting their Subjects after a
Religious manner; ſo I ſhall make
it appear in the ſequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that it was owing to the
ſame thing that the ancient Poets
very often excell'd themſelves.</p>
            <p>And I have Reaſon to believe
that one of the Principal Reaſons,
that has made the Modern Poetry
ſo contemptible, is, that by diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf of Religion, it is fall'n
from its dignity, and its original
Nature and Excellence, and from
the greateſt production of the Mind
of Man, is dwindled to an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
and a vain Amuſement.
For the Modern Poetry being for
the moſt part Prophane, has either
very little Spirit, or if it has a
great one, that Spirit is out of
Nature, becauſe it bears no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0365900900:147"/>
of Proportion to the Ideas from
which it is forcibly denv'd, nor the
Ideas very often to the Objects from
which they are taken; for as
Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> ſays,
<q>
                  <l>In boundleſs Verſe the Fancy ſoars too high</l>
                  <l>For any Object but the Deity.</l>
                  <l>What Mortal can with Heav'n pretend to ſhare</l>
                  <l>In the Superlatives of Wiſe and Fair?</l>
                  <l>A meaner Object when with theſe we grace</l>
                  <l>A Giant Habit on a Dwarf we place.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But that the Modern Poetry as
miſerably as it is fall'n from the
Dignity of its original Nature,
might gloriouſly ariſe and lift up
its Head, ſurpaſſing ev'n that of
the Ancients, if the Poets would
but conſtitute their Subjects Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
I have formerly clearly ſhewn
in the Second Part of the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Modern Poetry; by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Deſign of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion is the very ſame, with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0365900900:148"/>
that of Poetry, which can be ſaid
of no other Religion, that the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of both is to delight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
mankind, by exciting the
Paſſions in ſuch a manner as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
them to Reaſon, and reſtore
the Harmony of the humane Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And therefore that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
nothing at preſent that I have
formerly ſaid there; I ſhall only
add, that if 'tis Religion that gives
the warmth and the Paſſion to
Poetry, it follows that the leſs mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that Religion has of any thing
Prophane and Humane in it, the
greater warmth and Paſſion it muſt
give to Poetry; for that which
moves us in effect in a falſe Religion
muſt be the Imagination of that
which is true. As for Example in
the above mention'd paſſage of the
wrath of <hi>Neptune;</hi> the Anger of
<hi>Neptune</hi> is Fiction, and ſo is the
Stroke of His Trident; but that which
moves us at the bottom of this
Fiction is true, which is, that the
Anger of a Deity and the effects of
it are very terrible. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0365900900:149"/>
why Religion moves the Soul
ſo extreamly, is becauſe the Soul
was Created by God, to find its
Happineſs in Him, and all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
conſiſts in Pleaſure, and all
Pleaſure in Paſſion. Now the leſs
mixture Religion has of any thing
of Human Invention in it, the more
Divine it is and the nearer it brings
us to God.</p>
            <p>But that this may ſtill appear
the more clearly, we ſhall Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to prove it by two very Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Examples, and ſhall produce two
paſſages from Scripture; the one
from the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and the other from
<hi>Habbakuk;</hi> which we ſhall ſet againſt
the Two foremention'd Paſſages
which <hi>Longinus</hi> cited from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi>
the one of the Wrath and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Power of <hi>Neptune;</hi> and
his awful march through his own
Element; and in ſetting theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
againſt one another we make
no doubt to ſhew, that not only
the Subjects are exactly the ſame,
but that the Advantage is clearly
ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0365900900:150"/>
Let us begin with that Paſſage
concerning the might of <hi>Neptune,</hi>
and his driving his Chariot thro'
the Sea.</p>

               <l>As from the ſhaggy Mountain He deſcends,</l>

            </q>
            <p>And anon.</p>

               <l>His golden Chariot <hi>Neptune</hi> now Aſcends,</l>
               <l>And as He drives along the Watry Plain,</l>
               <l>Huge Whales and all the Monſters of the Main</l>
               <l>Tempeſt the Ocean to Salute their King,</l>

            <p>But here it will be Neceſſary to
anſwer an Objection, for it may be
urg'd perhaps that Common Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
will Deſtroy theſe new Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
For ſeveral of the Moderns
have attempted Divine Poetry, and yet
ſome of them have been Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
to the laſt Degree, and not
one of them has excell'd the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</p>
            <p>To which we anſwer that <hi>Milton</hi>
has clearly the advantage of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
in ſeveral points, as ſhall be
ſhewn in its proper place; and if the
reſt of the Moderns who have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Sacred Poetry have fall'n ſo very
much ſhort of them, it has been either
for want of Genius or for want of
Art to know how to make uſe of
Religion. For Sacred Poetry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
requires a greater capacity
than the Prophane does, becauſe
the greater the Ideas are, the greater
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0365900900:157"/>
muſt the Capacity be that receives
them. But Sacred Ideas are greater
then the Prophane, as hath been
ſhewn above. And therefore if the
Rule of <hi>Horace</hi> be true, that a Poet
ought to proportion his Subject to
his Strength, it follows that a Man
may Succeed pretty well in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Poetry and yet be deſpicable in
the Divine. Beſides as Religion
ſupplies us with greater Ideas than
any thing Human can do; ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
greater Enthuſiaſm and a
greater Spirit to attend them, as
has been ſhewn above too. So that
Sacred Poetry requires not only a
very great Capacity, but a very
warm and Strong Imagination;
which is a happy mixture that is to be
met with in a very few, and ev'n of
thoſe few not one in a Thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
applies himſelf to ſacred Poetry.
And ev'n of thoſe rare ones who have
apply'd themſelves hardly one of the
Moderns has known the true uſe that
ought to be made of Religion in
Poetry. <hi>Milton,</hi> indeed happen'd
upon it, in his Paridiſe loſt, I ſay hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
upon it, becauſe He has err'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0365900900:158"/>
very widely from it in his Paradiſe
Regain'd, as ſhall be ſhewn in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place. The Rules for Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Religion in Poetry are Principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe which follow.</p>
            <p>1. The Firſt is, That the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ought to be one, that the
Poet may be mov'd by it, and
that he may appear to be in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.
And the not obſerving of
this Rule, was one Reaſon why
<hi>Spencer</hi> miſcarried as we ſhall ſhew
anon.</p>
            <p>2. The Second Rule, That the
Religion which the Poet Employs
ought to be the Reigning one,
that both the Poet and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
may be mov'd the more by
a Religion in which they were
bred. And this Rule may acquaint us
with one of the reaſons why all who
have tranſlated <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi>
have ſucceeded ſo very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0365900900:159"/>
3. The Third is that it may run
thro' and be incorporated with the
Action of the Poem, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that it may always be a
part of Action and Productive of
Action, for from the neglect of
this Third Rule, ſtrange inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
would follow in a Poem, as
ſhall be ſhewn more at large,
when we treat of <hi>Spencer</hi> and
<hi>Cowley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The Fourth Rule is, That the
Religion may be manag'd ſo as to
promote the violence of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick
Paſſions and their change
and variety; and the conſtituting
his Subject contrary to this Rule,
was one great reaſon why <hi>Milton</hi>
did not ſucceed in his Paradiſe
Regain'd.</p>
            <p>5. That it may not hinder the
Violence of the ordinary Paſſions,
nor the Change and Variety of
them; and the not conſtituting
his Subject according to this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0365900900:160"/>
Rule is the chief reaſon, why
<hi>Homer</hi> in his Odyſſes fell ſo far
ſhort of his Iliads; and <hi>Milton</hi> of
his Paradiſe Loſt, in his Paradiſe
Regain'd.</p>
            <p>6. That the Religion be manag'd
ſo as not to obſtruct the violence
of Action, which is always attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the violence of ordinary
Paſſion; and the not obſerving of
this, was one great Reaſon of the
miſcarriage of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi>
in the foremention'd Poems.</p>
            <p>7. That the Divine and Humane
Perſons if there be any, may have
Inclinations and Affections, which
<hi>Taſſo</hi>'s Celeſtial Perſons have not,
nor as I Remember <hi>Cowley</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>8. That they be fairly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
from one another, by thoſe
Inclinations and Affections. And
this is the great Advantage that
the Grecian Machines, have for
the moſt part over thoſe in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Yet <hi>Milton</hi> has pretty well
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0365900900:161"/>
diſtinguiſh'd his Celeſtial Perſons
from one another, and his Infernal
ones admirably.</p>
            <p>4. That they be fairly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Human Perſons, by
the ſame Inclinations and Affections.
And here <hi>Milton</hi> in his Infernal
Perſons has undeniably the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
both of Ancients and Moderns.
The Paſſions and Inclinations of
the Graecian Gods, are downright
Human Inclinations and Affections.
The Paſſions of <hi>Miltons</hi>'s Devils have
enough of Humanity in them to
make them delightful, but then they
have a great deal more to make
them admirable and may be ſaid
to be the true Paſſions of Devils;
but the time to ſpeak more largely
of this will be when we come to
the Epick Poets.</p>
            <p>But now as we have ſhewn that
the Religion Reveal'd in the Old
and New Teſtament is proper, nay
Neceſſary to give the laſt force
and Elevation to Poetry; we ſhall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0365900900:162"/>
now Endeavour to Convince the
Reader that Poetry is proper if not
Neceſſary, to give force to that
Religion. For indeed there are Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in this Religion, which cannot
be worthily perform'd without the
a ſſiſtance of Poetry. As the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up Praiſe and Thankſgiving
and ſeveral ſorts of Pray'r to God;
and the Celebrating the Wonders
of his Might? Becauſe if the Ideas
which theſe Subjects afford; are
expreſt with Paſſion equal to their
greatneſs, that which expreſſes them
is Poetry, for that which makes
Poetry to be what it is, is only
becauſe it has more Paſſion than
any other way of writing.</p>
            <p>It is Ridiculous to Imagine that
there can be a more proper way to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
ſome parts and Duties of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which we believe to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inſpir'd, than the very way
in which they were at firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.
Now the moſt Important
part of the Old Teſtament was
deliver'd not only in a Poetical
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0365900900:163"/>
Style but in Poetical Numbers. The
moſt Important parts of the Old
Teſtament to us are the Propheſies.
Becauſe without them we could
never be ſatisfied that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is
the Meſſiah, For the Prophets
were Poets by the Inſtitution of
their Order, and Poetry was one
of the Prophetick Functions, which
were chiefly Three. 1. Predicting
or foretelling things to come. 2.
Declaring the will of God to the
People. And 3. Praiſing God with
Songs of the Prophets compoſing,
accompanied with the Harp and
other Inſtrumental Muſick. From
whence it came to paſs, that
praiſing God upon ſuch kind of
Inſtruments, is often in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
call'd Prophecying, as Mr.
<hi>Mede</hi> has obſerv'd in his Diatribae;
and has prov'd it from ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of the Old Teſtament, and
more particularly from the 3 Firſt
Verſes of the 25th Ch. of the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi>
which are as follows.</p>
            <p>V. 1.Moreover <hi>David</hi> and the
Captains of the Hoſt, ſeperated to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0365900900:164"/>
the Service of the Sons of <hi>Aſaph,</hi>
and of <hi>Heman,</hi> and of <hi>Jeduthun,</hi>
ſuch as ſhould Propheſie with Harps,
with Pſalteries and with Cymbals, and
the Number of the Workmen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their ſervice was</p>
            <p>V. 2. Of the Sons of <hi>Aſaph; Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi>
and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Nethaniah</hi> and
<hi>Aſarelah,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Aſaph;</hi> under
the Hands of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> which Propheſied
according to the Order of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. 3.Of <hi>Jeduthun,</hi> the Sons of
<hi>Jeduthun, Gedaliah</hi> and <hi>Zeri</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaiah,
Haſhabiah,</hi> and <hi>Metithiah</hi>
Six, under the Hands of their Father
<hi>Jeduthun, who Propheſied with a Harp,
to give thanks and to praiſe the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was their Poetical Talent
confin'd to their Praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
but is to be ſeen in their
Predictions too as we ſaid before,
and in their declaring the Will of
God to the People.</p>
            <p>As the Prophets were Poets by
their Inſtitution, ſo when the Son
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0365900900:165"/>
of God himſelf, came down from
Heaven in order to reform the
Earth, He who was a Prophet as
well as a Prieſt and a King, did
by conſequence diſcharge the Three
Prophetical Functions, of which
the Poetical has been ſhewn to be
one. And conſequently tho' our
Saviour did not make uſe of a
Style, that was Figurative and
Enthuſiaſtick; becauſe he Inſtructed
the World as God, and as God He
could not feel either Admiration or
Terrour, or the reſt of the Enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Paſſions, yet we find that
He not only prais'd God with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Songs, but that the Method
of His Inſtruction was entirely
Poetical, that is by Fables or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
contriv'd and plac'd and
adapted to work very ſtrongly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Human Paſſions.</p>
            <p>Thus the Prophets among the
Jews were Poets, and the Divine
Inſtitutor of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being a Prophet, by a Poetical
method inſtructed and reform'd the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0365900900:166"/>
World. And ev'n the Graecian Poets
pretending to diſcharge the Three
Prophetical Functions, were not only
vulgarly reputed Prophets but were
ftyl'd ſo by St. <hi>Paul</hi> Himſelf, who
quoting a verſe out of <hi>Epimenides</hi>
in the Epiſtle which He wrote to
<hi>Titus,</hi> calls that Cretenſian Poet a
Prophet. <hi>As one of their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
has ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have made it very
plain, that not only the Predictions
but the Praiſe and Thankſgiving,
in the Inſpir'd Writers were written
in Verſe; as were likewiſe ſeveral
of the Prayers, and the Inſtructions,
and in ſhort the Nobleſt and moſtIm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
part of the Old Teſtament:
Now if they were written in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,
it could be for no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but becauſe they who wrote
them, Believ'd that the Figurative
Paſſionate Style, and the Poetical
Numbers did by Right of Nature
belong to them, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
were requiſite to inforce
them upon the Minds of Men. And
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0365900900:167"/>
here we cannot as it were help ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
that for the Scriptures to
make all the Impreſſion that they
are Capable of making upon Men
of very good parts, and perhaps
too upon others, all thoſe parts of
them that were written in Verſe
ought to be tranſlated in Verſe; and
by Perſons who are the moſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd
to do it with Force and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
For if the Paſſion and
Harmony were thought requiſite
by the Original Writers, who were
Divinely inſpir'd to give force to
the Hebrew; why ſhould not Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Paſſion and Numbers in a
Tranſlation give a Proportionable
force to that? For if Harmony of
it ſelf is of force to lift up our
Thoughts to Heaven, as our
Clergy ſeem to Emply by the uſe
of it in our Churches; and may
be gathered from what happen'd
to <hi>Eliſha</hi> in the Second of <hi>Kings,</hi>
when they would have had him
Propheſie at a time when the Spirit
of Propheſie Ch. 3. v. 15. was not upon
him. Where the Prophet ſays, <hi>now bring
me a Minſtrel, and it came to paſs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0365900900:168"/>
as the Minſtrel plaid that the Hand
of the Lord came upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Harmony I ſay is of it ſelf ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious,
what muſt it not be,
when Incorporated with a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Senſe, and a Poetical Style.
There can certainly be no better
way to Reform the World than
the reading of thoſe Writings which
we believe to be divinely inſpir'd;
But this is as certain, that the
greater the pleaſure is with which we
Read them, we ſhall the more
frequently diſcharge that Duty, but
to make us read them with more
pleaſure than we do, they muſt have
more of the agreableneſs of their
Originals, that is more Perſpicuity,
more Force and more Harmony. This
would more particularly attract the
Gentry, and particularly thoſe of
the moſt Extraordinary Parts among
them, whoſe examples would influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the reſt as the reſt would influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the People. For they of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Parts for the moſt part being
Extreamly delighted with Poetry,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0365900900:169"/>
and finding the greateſt and moſt
exalted Poetry upon Religious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
would by degrees become more
us'd to be mov'd by Sacred Ideas
than they would by prophane; that
is would by degrees become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.
That this is by no
means a Chimera, Experience may
ſerve to convince us. For I know
ſeveral Gentlemen of very good
Senſe who are extreamly mov'd
by <hi>Miltons</hi> Hymn in the fifth Book
of Paradiſe loſt, and hardly at all
ſtirr'd with the Tranſlation of the
148 <hi>Pſalm</hi> from whence that Hymn
is taken. But if Men of very good
parts are more mov'd by the Hymn,
it follows that they ought to be
more mov'd by it; becauſe Men of
very good Senſe are only mov'd to
that Degree by things by which
they ought to be mov'd. So that
we may Conclude that the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Enthuſiaſm in that Hymn
is exactly in Nature, that is, that
the Enthuſiaſm, or Paſſion, or Spirit
call it what you will, flows from
the Ideas, and bears a juſt Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0365900900:170"/>
But from hence at the ſame
time it follows, that ſince thoſe
Perſons who are ſo much mov'd
by the Hymn, are not equally ſtirr'd
by the Translated Pſalm, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or Spirit is leſs in the latter
and do's not come up to the Ideas;
and therefore we may conclude
that <hi>Milton</hi> by his Genius and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
has reſtor'd that Spirit in
Compoſing the Hymn, which had
been loſt by the weakneſs of the
Tranſlation and the want of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Numbers. Which laſt as we
have ſaid before contribute very
much to the raiſing of Paſſion.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Milton</hi> has done in relation
to the 148 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> others may do
in a leſs proportion to other parts
of the Old Teſtament, till the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Prince and publick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
cauſes another <hi>Milton</hi>
to ariſe and apply Himſelf to ſo
neceſſary and ſo noble a work.
For this is certain that there are
not wanting great Genius's to every
Age. But they do not equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0365900900:171"/>
in every Age, ſometimes for want
of knowing themſelves; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for want of Encouragement
and leiſure to exert themſelves. The
buſineſs of the following Treatiſe is to
ſhew them how they may try and
know, and form themſelves, which
is all that I am capable of attempting
towards the Reſtoring ſo uſeful and ſo
noble an Art. If I were in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to give them Encouragement
too they ſhould not be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. If they who ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
me in Pow'r, did but equal
me in Will, we ſhould ſoon ſee
Poetry raiſe up its dejected Head,
and our own might come to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Happieſt of Grecian and
Roman Ages.</p>
            <p>And thus much may ſuffice to
ſhew the Nature of Poetry, but
chiefly of the greater Poetry,
and the Importance of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
For ſince Poetry has been
thought not only by Heathens, but
by the Writers of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and conſequently by God
Himſelf who inſpir'd them, to be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0365900900:172"/>
the fitteſt method for the inforcing
Religion upon the Minds of Men,
and ſince Religion is the only ſolid
Foundation of all Civil Society,
it follows, that whoever Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to Re-eſtabliſh Poetry, makes
a generous attempt to reſtore an
Art, that may be highly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to the Publick, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to Mankind.</p>
