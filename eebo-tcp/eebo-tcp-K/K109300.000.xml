            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Privilege of Poetry (or it may be the Vanity of the Pretenders to it) has given 'em a kind of Right to pretend, at the ſame time, to the Favour of thoſe, whom
<pb facs="tcp:0681501400:4"/>
their high Birth and excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities have plac'd in a very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing manner above the reſt of the World. If this be not a receiv'd Maxim, yet I am ſure I am to wiſh it were, that I may have at leaſt ſome kind of Excuſe for laying this Tragedy at Your Grace's Feet. I have too much reaſon to fear that it may prove but an indifferent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to Your Grace, ſince if I have any way ſucceeded in it, it has been in deſcribing thoſe violent Paſſions which have been always Strangers to ſo happy a Temper, and ſo noble and ſo exalted a Virtue as Your Grace is Miſtreſs of. Yet for all this, I cannot but confeſs the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which I have, to hope that there may be ſomething ſo moving in the Misfortunes and Diſtreſs of the Play, as may be not altogether unworthy of Your Grace's Pity. This is one of the main Deſigns of Tragedy, and to
<pb facs="tcp:0681501400:5"/>
excite this generous Pity in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Minds, may paſs for ſome kind of Succeſs in this way of Writing. I am ſenſible of the Preſumption I am guilty of by this Hope, and how much it is that I pretend to in Your Grace's Approbation; if it be my good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to meet with any little Share of it, I ſhall always look upon it as much more to me than the general Applauſe of the Theatre, or even the Praiſe of a good Critick. Your Grace's Name is the beſt Protection this Play can hope for, ſince the World, ill-natur'd as it is, agrees in an univerſal Reſpect and Deference for Your Grace's Perſon and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. In ſo cenſorious an Age as this is, where Malice furniſhes out all the Publick Converſations, where every Body pulls and is pull'd to pieces of courſe, and where there is hardly ſuch a thing as being merry, but at another's Expence; yet by a
<pb facs="tcp:0681501400:6"/>
publick and uncommon Juſtice to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Her Name has never been mention'd, but as it ought, tho' She has Beauty enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Detraction from the Faireſt of Her own Sex, and Virtue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the Looſe and Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute of the other (a very formidable Party) Her Enemies. Inſtead of this they agree to ſay nothing of Her but what She deſerves, That Her Spirit is worthy of Her Birth; Her Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of the Love and Reſpect of all the World; Her Piety, of Her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; Her Service, of Her Royal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; and Her Beauty and Truth, of Her Lord; that in ſhort every part of Her Character is Juſt, and that She is the beſt Reward for one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hero's this Age has produc'd. This, Madam, is what You muſt allow Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple every where to ſay; thoſe whom You ſhall leave behind You in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will have ſomething further to
<pb facs="tcp:0681501400:7"/>
add, the Loſs we ſhall ſuffer by your Grace's Journey to <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Queen's Pleaſure, and the Impatient Wiſhes of that Nation are about to deprive us of Two of our Publick Ornaments. But there is no arguing againſt Reaſons ſo prevalent as theſe. Thoſe who ſhall lament your Grace's Abſence will yet acquieſce in the Wiſdom and Juſtice of Her Majeſty's Choice: Among all whoſe Royal Favours none cou'd be ſo agreeable, upon a thouſand Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, to that People, as the Duke of <hi>Ormond.</hi> With what Joy, what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations ſhall they meet a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, who beſide their former Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to His Family, has ſo lately ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd His Life and Fortune for their Preſervation; What Duty, what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſhall they not pay to that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the Queen has delegated to a Perſon ſo dear to 'em? And with what Honour, what Reſpect ſhall they receive Your Grace, when they look
<pb facs="tcp:0681501400:8"/>
upon You as the Nobleſt and Beſt Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern Her Majeſty cou'd ſend 'em, of her own Royal Goodneſs, and Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Virtues? They ſhall behold Your Grace with the ſame Pleaſure the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> ſhall take when ever it ſhall be their good Fortune to ſee You return again to Your Native Country. In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Your Grace is become a Publick Concern, and as Your going away will be attended with a general Sorrow, ſo Your Return ſhall give as general a Joy; and to none of thoſe many, more than to,</p>

               <l>LONG has the Fate of Kings and Empires been</l>
               <l>The common Busineſs of the Tragick Scene,</l>
               <l>As if Misfortune made the Throne her Seat,</l>
               <l>And none cou d be unhappy but the Great.</l>
               <l>Dearly 'tis true each buys the Crown he wears,</l>
               <l>And many are the mighty Monarch's Cares:</l>
               <l>By foreign Foes and home-bred Factions preſt,</l>
               <l>Few are the Joys he knows and ſhort his Hours of Reſt.</l>

               <l>See how ſucceeding Paſſions rage by turns,</l>
               <l>How fierce the Youth with Joy and Rapture burns,</l>
               <l>And how to Death for Beauty loſt, he mourns.</l>

               <l>YOU ſee the tripping Dame could find no Favour,</l>
               <l>Dearly ſhe paid for Breach of good Behaviour,</l>
               <l>Nor could her loving Husband's Fondneſs ſave her.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Italian</hi> Ladies lead but ſcurvy Lives,</l>
               <l>There's dreadful dealing with Eloping Wives;</l>
               <l>Thus 'tis, becauſe theſe Husbands are obey'd</l>
               <l>By force of Laws, which for themſelves they made,</l>
               <l>With Tales of old Preſcriptions they confiae,</l>
               <l>The Right of Marriage-rule to their Male Line,</l>
               <l>And Huſt, and Domineer by Right Divine,</l>
               <l>Had we the Pow'r we'd make the Tyrants know,</l>
               <l>What 'tis to fail in Duties which they owe;</l>
               <l>We'd teach the ſaunt'ring Squire, who loves to roam,</l>
               <l>Forgetful of his own dear Spouſe and Home;</l>
               <l>Who Snores at Night ſupinely by her ſide,</l>
               <l>'Twas not for this the Nuptial Knot was ty'd.</l>
               <l>The plodding Petty-fogger, and the Cit,</l>
               <l>Have learn'd at leaſt this Modern way of Wit:</l>

               <l>Has th' Impudence to think his Wife a Fool;</l>
               <l>He ſpends the Night, where merry Wags reſort,</l>
               <l>With joking Clubs, and Eighteen-penny Port,</l>
               <l>While ſhe poor Soul's contented to regale,</l>
               <l>By a ſad Sea-cole Fire, with Wigs and Ale.</l>

Well may the Cuckold-making Tribe find Grace,</l>

               <l>No Foreign Charms ſhall cauſe Domeſtick Strife,</l>
