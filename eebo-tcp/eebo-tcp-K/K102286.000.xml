            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE HIGHWAYMAN.</head>
               <p>THIS was in the merry month of May, when the whole animal creation, from the minuteſt inſect the microſcope diſcovers upon the leaf, to the largeſt beaſt which grazes in the field, or preys in the foreſt; when the fowls of the air, from the diminutive hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bird to the eagle of the ſun; when the fiſhes of the ſea, from the little ſprat to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy leviathan, pay implicit obedience to that divine ordinance of heaven, <hi>increaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi> I ſay, it was in the month of May, ſo juſtly ſtiled "the mother of love," when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wears an univerſal ſmile, when every plant and tree ſprouts forth in bud and bloſſom, and the whole earth is cloathed in variegated green: being faſt aſleep in a ſtage-coach on the road to Windſor, and my imagination having taken an excurſion in a dream to viſit,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0063901300:7"/>
to converſe with, and to embrace, ſome dear friends in Ireland, I was diſturbed from my ſweet viſion about five miles from London, by a tremendous voice, from the ſide of the road, which with reiterated vociferation, roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, Stop! ſtop!</p>
               <p>My hands inſtinctively ſlipped into my breeches pocket, and with a motion equally involuntary, drew forth a ſmall purſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſmall ſum of one guinea and a few ſhillings, to give the highwayman. The coachman at the ſame inſtant drew up his horſes.</p>
               <p>If any hero wiſhes to be informed why I did not rather apply to my piſtols—I had none with me, or if I had, I ſhould not have applied to them.</p>
               <p>Indeed, inſtead of charging my piſtols, which I left hanging up in my chambers, where may they long hang for ornaments, I had prepared the ſmall ſum I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and put it into the little purſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, in caſe of being ſtopped; for it has long been my opinion, that if a man conſiders his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0063901300:8"/>
own intereſt, in which undoubtedly his <hi>peace of mind</hi> has an intimate and large ſhare—to part with what he can ſpare from his abſolute neceſſities, will appear preferable to riſquing riſe for a trifle. It requires no great portion of humanity to conclude, that to deprive a fellow-creature of life, and diſpatch his ſoul in the very act of ſin, to
<q>that country from whoſe bourne no traveller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns,</q>
though compatible with earthly <hi>juſtice,</hi> muſt be offenſive to eternal <hi>mercy.</hi> If this aſſertion be erroneous, how comes it that the act of ſacrificing a wretch's life in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a paltry ſum, always impreſſes upon the mind of the avenger, a horror which amounts to puniſhment?</p>
               <p>As the coach-door opened I put out my hand—here, my honeſt friend, ſaid I, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing myſelf to the highwayman, here, take my money.</p>
               <p>I received a ſhot in return for my cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy—</p>
               <p>I ſay a ſhot—but not a ſhot from a piſtol, nor a ſhot from a blunderbuſs—it was a chain-ſhot,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0063901300:9"/>
or a double-headed ſhot, which you pleaſe, diſcharged from a pair of as bright eyes as ever wounded the heart of an unwary traveller.</p>
               <p>The lady miſtaking the offer of my hand, which intended to convey my purſe to the ſuppoſed highwayman, for an offer to aſſiſt her into the carriage, ſeized it with the moſt good humoured familiarity, and fixing her right foot firm upon the coach-ſtep, raiſed her body up with a ſpring of agility, which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, elaſticity was not the leaſt property in her compoſition.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhe ſtood in equilibrium, nodding and ſmiling a farewel over her left ſhoulder, to a male friend, the perſon who had ordered the coach to ſtop: and taking her ſeat exactly oppoſite to me, ſhe waved her hand out of the coach window, to her parting companion —the coachman, with a <hi>hoi, hoi,</hi> and a crack of his whip, informed his horſes of their duty, the horſes obeyed, and we drove on.</p>

This courtly condeſcenſion to the Virgin Queen, has nothing particular in it.— When Queen Anne had a lame leg, the women of faſhion carried crutch-ſticks; and not many years paſt, the late French King being forced to cut off the fore-top of his hair, on account of a <hi>ſcald-head,</hi> not only the nobility and gentry of France, but the nobility and gentry of Great-Britain and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, cropped their upper locks cloſe to the ſcull.

               <p>I ſuppoſe, Sir, ſaid my fellow-traveller, we ſhall breakfaſt here, as the coach ſtopped at the <hi>Star and Garter</hi> at Kew-bridge.—I leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and gave the lady my hand:—ſhe ſprung forward, but the treacherous hoop croſſing the door of the coach, gave ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a jerk to the lady, that as ſhe ſprung ſhe fell, and as ſhe fell, of courſe the hoop became inverſed, as you may have ſeen an umbrella, or <hi>paraſol,</hi> on a windy day—ſhe ſlipped from under her garments.—Heaven preſerve us!</p>

               <p>The lady, having adjuſted her drapery, came out ſideways—</p>

               <head>A MEDITATION.</head>
               <p>THE ſcene at the inn-door, when I inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently gazed up on the <hi>Star and Garter,</hi> was freſh in my memory. Not an aſtronomer of them all, from Ptolemy the Egyptian, down to Copernicus the German, and from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus the German, down to Newton the Engliſhman, had ever ſo ſtrong a conception of the <hi>hirſute</hi> conſtellation, called by <hi>ſtar-gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Berenice</hi>'s <hi>locks,</hi> as I had of the <hi>ſign</hi> at Kew-bridge.—Every object was painted upon my imagination in the moſt lively colours.</p>
               <p>I recollected the lady's confuſion on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate event of her <hi>pocket-hoop</hi>—and this recollection produced in my mind an inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>modeſty.</hi>—When an Indian was aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how he could go naked, and expoſe his body to the cold air, he anſwered,
<q>becauſe I am all <hi>face.</hi>
                  </q>
Now the ſame anſwer would
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0063901300:20"/>
have been as pertinent had it related to <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,</hi> inſtead of <hi>feeling</hi>; for in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where the inhabitants go perfectly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they look upon each other as undiſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with as chaſte an eye, and unfluſhed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as if they were <hi>all face.</hi> With them every part is equally indifferent as to ſight: the leſs <hi>modeſty</hi> the leſs <hi>feeling</hi>;—the leſs <hi>feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the leſs <hi>incontinence,</hi> in thought, in word, and in deed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were remarkable for <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> yet poſſeſſed very little <hi>modeſty</hi>; and when we compare their cuſtoms with the cuſtoms of the chearful, happy inhabitants of the <hi>ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern iſles,</hi> diſcovered by Captain Cooke, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the Lacedaemonians were perfect <hi>maſters,</hi> and <hi>miſtreſſes</hi> too, of the celebrated <hi>Timiradi dance,</hi> practiſed by the people of both ſexes in <hi>Otaheite</hi> 
                  <note n="(1)" place="bottom">
                     <p>Plato, after the example of ſeveral well inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted republicks, ordained, that the men and women of all ages ſhould diveſt themſelves of their cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and appear perfectly naked; you will ſee the reaſon of it in his <hi>Gymnaſtick.</hi> The women of <hi>Pegu</hi> wear no covering below the waiſt, but a cloath ſlit up before.—The Lacedaemonian women ſaw daily the Spartan youth perform their exerciſes naked, and wore ſuch ſlight garments themſelves, that as they walked diſcovered their thighs, they being, as Plato ſays, ſufficiently covered with their virtue.— MONTAIGNE.</p>
                     <p>This might perhaps cool the ſenſe of <hi>ſeeing</hi>—but how did it affect <hi>feeling.—Seeing's</hi> believing, but <hi>feeling</hi> has no <hi>fellow.</hi>—<bibl>RAY'S PROVERB.</bibl>

of the ladies, whether the daughter of <hi>Cato</hi> was right in her opinion, that women ſhould <hi>take off</hi> and <hi>reaſſume</hi> their <hi>modeſty</hi> with their <hi>garments.</hi> It is certain the Roman matron was a <hi>patriot,</hi> not however of that claſs of <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots</hi> who ornament the <hi>preſent times</hi>; ſhe was not influenced by <hi>ſelf</hi>—but from a regard to <hi>poſterity.</hi>—And where is the woman who has not a regard to <hi>poſterity?</hi> I anſwer—the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who is not ſolely attached to <hi>one</hi> man, has neither regard for <hi>poſterity</hi> nor for <hi>herſelf,</hi> and cannot be a patriot.</p>
               <p>Thus did I mentally philoſophize, till after long meditation, I concluded with a modern voyager <note n="(1)" place="bottom">Forſter, who attended Captain Cooke on his ſecond voyage.</note>, who from the contemplation of unpoliſhed people, has drawn this opinion,

               <p>Oh chaſtity! thou art a great and ſhining virtue in civilized ſtates!

               </p>
               <p>And what is to be deduced from this?

               <p>THE lady ſlept on—ſmiled as ſhe ſlept, and as ſhe ſmiled <hi>ſhe</hi> ſighed—</p>
               <p>Health ſported upon her cheek, while love, with a moſt inticing grace, diffuſed a non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, if not inviting complacency over every feature, and wantoned on her neck.—Her lips ſmooth, and red as coral, pouted with ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with a glowing ripeneſs equal to the bluſh of the wild ſtrawberry, ſmooth as the ſattin'd ſoftneſs of the nectarine's coat, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to give emiſſion to her breath, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſet of teeth vying with orient pearl.—</p>
               <p>Her breath!—</p>
               <p>I ſat oppoſite to her—Her breath fanned me with a fragrance, infinitely more inſpiring, not leſs odoriferous, than the evening zephyr of June, agitating a roſe-thicket, ſtealing its

ſweets <note n="(1)" place="margin">If Mrs. DAWSON looks in her glaſs ſhe will ſee an original reſembling this picture.—</note>.—The effect, however, was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; the fanning zephyr would have cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the ſouthern blaſt that gathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming heat from the burning deſert of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, could not ſcorch with more violence than the breath of my fellow-traveller.—</p>
               <p>All appeared quiet within the peaceful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of her boſom, which, gently heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preſerved uninterrupted calmneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when a half-ſuppreſſed ſigh, or ſhort breathing, broke in upon the regular ſerenity of its motion.</p>
               <p>She ſighed!—but her ſighs were not the ſighs of ſorrow—neither were they the ſighs of pain—they were the ſighs of ſenſibility—and I diſcovered the nature of her ſighs, by the gentle agitations of pleaſure, which ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded their riſings, as tender harbingers, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them as affectionate attendants.—</p>
               <p>It is probable the lady was in a dream, if ſhe was, it was a dream of ſuch ſenſibility,

               <p>Still the lady ſlept—and ſmiled—and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and ſlipped, unconſcious of her danger; but the coach-wheel ſlipping into a <hi>waggon-rut,</hi> I ſlipt forward, the lady ſlipt downward, and my <hi>Lord Coke,</hi> who had lain unnoticed upon the ſeat, ever ſince I came into the coach in the morning, ſlipt down at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with the lady; but luckily reaching the bottom of the carriage firſt, his lordſhip broke her fall.</p>
               <p>I did all in my power to ſupport her, but in vain—though the lady did every thing ſhe could to ſupport herſelf, and my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> lent his aſſiſtance.—</p>
               <p>The accident appeared beyond remedy,— So being on my knees, I offered up a haſty, yet warm, ſincere ejaculation to the great God of Love, who lending an ear auſpicious to my prayer, in about two minutes I was extricated from—no—not extricated from my confuſion,

               <p>HAVING got out of the <hi>rut,</hi> and having paſſed the <hi>rough road,</hi> which cauſed the foregoing accident, the coach rolled on ſmoothly again.—</p>
               <p>Now there are many travellers who would rail for an hour without intermiſſion againſt theſe <hi>rough ſpots,</hi> which every man muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet upon his journey, let him travel what road he will.—Some men meet them on <hi>high roads,</hi> ſome men meet them on <hi>bye roads.</hi>—Some men meet them on mountains. —Some men meet them in <hi>vallies.</hi>—They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the rich man in his chariot, and the poor man on the humble foot-path way. —Philoſophers have met theſe <hi>rough ſpots</hi> upon the ſummit of the Alps, the <hi>virtuoſi</hi> have met them in the ſtreets of Rome.—Nay, it has been ſaid, that very wiſe and grave philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have met them on the very carpets of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0063901300:35"/>
their libraries. For my part, I meet them here and there, and every where, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I meet them, whether on high road, or on bye road, on mountain, on valley, or on plain, I make the moſt of them. Wherever I travel, or in whatever manner I travel, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I travel in a carriage, on horſe-back, or on foot, I never abuſe them.—</p>
               <p>Thank Heaven! there is a complacency in my diſpoſition, which bids defiance to trifling caſualties; and whether the road be <hi>rough,</hi> or whether the road be <hi>ſmooth,</hi> my temper is ſtill the ſame, and I never quarrel with the road, nor with myſelf, nor with any thing I meet, but go whiſtling on—I only wiſh I may never meet theſe rough ſpots on Mount Aetna, on Mount Veſuvius, or on any other <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> mount.—I care not how <hi>warm</hi> the climate is—but Heaven preſerve me from <hi>volcanos!</hi> —I have an implacable averſion to <hi>fire!</hi>—</p>
               <p>A road may be conſidered as an emblem of life, and much inſtruction may be picked up in very few miles travelling; yet ſome there are, and men of great name, who have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0063901300:36"/>
to Egypt, and have attained nothing but the height of the Pyramids, or a ſketch of the Sphynx, though they have written whole volumes upon what they <hi>have ſeen,</hi> and have not <hi>ſeen</hi>;—while others have been able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a thouſand objects, in a ſpace not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than from London to Highgate, upon which they have exerciſed all the benignity of philanthrophy.—</p>
               <p>A road, I ſay, may be conſidered as an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of life.—How various the proſpect on the right and on the left!—Sometimes a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, ſometimes a cloudy ſky.—How diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent are the paſſengers in their ſize, in their complexion, and in the manner of purſuing their journey?—What innumerable ſtops from turnpikes!—What a number of croſs roads! —How many arreſts from accidents!—And how few make for the ſame reſting-place, or purſue one certain conſtant gait.</p>
               <p>This now is philoſophizing—that is, if to philoſophize, be, as has been defined by ſome philoſophers, according to Montaigne, to write at random, and play the fool, as the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayiſt

               <head>THE CONFUSION.</head>
               <p>THE ſun had now riſen conſiderably above the horizon—the kine had returned to their paſtures, having paid their milky tribute to the dairy—and the honeſt hind, whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour enables the luxuriant and the lazy, to indulge in pleaſures, in ſenſuality and ſloth, while he experienced the effects of the firſt judgment, announced by the divine wiſdom againſt our primitive parents, by earning his bread with the ſweat of his brow, ſoftened its rigour with a chearful ſong, expreſſive of content.</p>
               <p>Every object looked ſprightly—every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject appeared gay—every object wore the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile dreſs of ſummer—every object, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and inanimate, contributed a ſhare of chearfulneſs to the ſcene.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0063901300:39"/>The ſituation in which the lady had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered herſelf on waking, had overwhelmed her with confuſion. A bluſh of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dye, far beyond the boaſted Tyrian, diffuſed its colour through her veins, ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, it ſpread over her fair boſom, and then, as if exhaled by the fire of her bright eyes, roſe to her face, and revelled in a rubid glow.</p>
               <p>The deep colour did not continue long— it faded by degrees to a roſy tint, but not to a fixed complexion—it ſported during the courſe of our journey, in delicate ſhades. It was not difficult to diſcover what the lady felt —it was evident, from the revulſion of her blood, that the ſoul laboured, and the body languiſhed.</p>
               <p>If my confuſion was not equal to the lady's, nor laſting as the confuſion which diſtreſſed her, I felt an equal ſhare of irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was my ardent wiſh to relieve her, if poſſible, though I ſtood in need of relief myſelf. I would have rouſed my ſpirits, but they had been ſo lately diſperſed, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0063901300:40"/>
to recruit them ſuddenly—I did all I could to rally them, but in vain. I looked to the lady for aſſiſtance—the lady looked from me, as demanding aſſiſtance for herſelf —our nerves thrilled in uniſon—the vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſympathetic—the tremor was reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal—ſo had been the cauſe.</p>
               <p>I looked again towards the lady, taking her at the ſame inſtant by the hand—the vital ſpirits began to revive from the lethargy they had lately ſunk into—the lady's hand lay in mine, a gentle mutual compreſſure gave my ſpirits the firſt alarm.</p>
               <p>As I looked towards the lady, ſhe turned her head round towards me, juſt ſo much as to give the profile of her face. A gentle ſigh, with a ſoliciting caſt of the eye informed me, ſhe expected relief at my hands. My heart felt the full force and propriety of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation—it almoſt amounted to reproach. But how ſhould I relieve her? My ideas were aſtray, my tongue was tied, and could as well have anſwered calmly from the rack, to the interrogatories of a perſecuting Spaniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor,

               <p>Neither of us could articulate a word— yet though ſilent, we converſed—for the lady by degrees looking full in my face, our eyes ſpoke, and we perfectly underſtood each other —it was the language of <hi>nature,</hi> whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations were ſincere, <hi>her</hi> thoughts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſguiſed, and ſcorn the deformities of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</p>

               <p>THE proſpect on my ſide being beautiful, naturally drew the lady's eyes that way to view it. We were admiring the landſcape, when a country lad and laſs, who appeared fatigued with the labour of the morning, for the laſs walked leaning upon the lad's arm, having arrived at the ſhady ſide of a hillock, ſat down—</p>
               <p>I reckoned four to my game.—</p>
               <p>The lad gave the laſs a <hi>kiſs</hi>—by the rule of the game I was entitled to reckon two more.—</p>
               <p>He kiſſed her again—again—and again— I foreſaw the game would be my own—<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core,</hi> ſaid I—</p>

               <p>And ***** that, Madam, continued I, pointing with my fore-finger thus ☞—is a <hi>quint</hi>—The lady looked up—looked forward, then looked up again, as if to look for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>ſky,</hi> and overlook every thing on the <hi>ground</hi>—ſhe then looked down and played with her <hi>apron ſtring.</hi>—</p>
               <p>The laſs on the hillock ſide, was alſo look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the <hi>ſky.</hi>—</p>
               <p>You will certainly loſe. Madam—I believe I ſhall loſe, ſaid the lady, tying and untying her apron ſtring.—</p>

               </p>
               <p>The lady took a ſerious look at the lad and laſs to be convinced of her loſs, and being convinced, turning her head aſide, tacitly acknowledged I had won.—</p>
               <p>The young country woman, who ſtopped the coach, had by this time agreed with the coachman—had aſcended the box, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted herſelf in her ſeat—</p>

                     <p>As the Reviewers, from the quantity of literary drudgery they are forced to go through every month, cannot poſſibly have time to read <hi>the whole</hi> of every book they give an opinion on; it is probable our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor introduced his <hi>introduction</hi> in this place, in hopes the reviewers would not read ſo far.—Next month will ſhew whether the reviewers have reached his <hi>introduction</hi>; indeed the probability is, that they will not peep farther than into the title page.—</p>

               <p>IN which introduction, if there ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any malice, envy, detraction, revenge, indecency, &amp;c. the courteous reader will recollect, that this ſame introduction was written at the <hi>inſtigation of the Devil,</hi> at a time when I had not the fear of heaven before my eyes.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid I have imitated STERNE. I have heard of an author who wrote a play in imitation of Shakeſpear, the play was a good play enough, and had one line ſtrongly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0063901300:63"/>
imitative of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s manner, which line was "good morrow, good maſter lieutenant." —It will be ſaid I imitate STERNE—It is true like STERNE, my pen guides me, I don't guide my pen. I write my thoughts liberally, unſtudied, and unarranged, as they ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ariſe to my imagination, without culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or pruning,—of conſequence they will be deficient in <hi>ornament,</hi> in <hi>profit,</hi> and in <hi>ſtrength</hi>—but if they are <hi>natural</hi> I am ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>I have always read STERNE with delight, and never read him but I felt him in my heart more than in my head; yet I hope his precepts have improved my underſtanding in the ſame proportion they have expanded my humanity. His precepts affect me like <hi>wine,</hi> they make my heart glad,—they affect me like <hi>love,</hi> or rather they affect me like a <hi>conjunction</hi> of <hi>love and wine,</hi> for they make me generous and gay. Imbibing his opinions has ſweetened whatever portion of acidity, Nature, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and Diſappointment have mixed in my compoſition; and having grafted them upon my heart, it is probable their emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

But I find it impoſſible to <hi>conceive</hi> (though I have called in my huſband's aid to my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance) the following aſſertion.—"<hi>Locke, Hume,</hi> and <hi>many other</hi> celebrated authors have favoured us with eſſays on education, but <hi>in</hi> ARABELLA <hi>they</hi> live;" now as <hi>Locke</hi> and <hi>Hume</hi> are indubitably <hi>dead,</hi> and we have not heard of their <hi>reſurrection,</hi> how comes it that <hi>they</hi> live in <hi>Arabella</hi>; indeed were they <hi>alive,</hi> it is out of nature to ſuppoſe they ſhould <hi>live</hi> ſo long <hi>in Arabella</hi>; for though <hi>Jonas</hi> lived a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time in the <hi>whale's belly,</hi> his life was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by miracle, and he was but <hi>one</hi> perſon; whereas it appears, that <hi>Arabella</hi> is <hi>enſient,</hi> that is, big with <hi>Locke, Hume,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>other</hi> authors. It is true, a certain dutcheſs of <hi>Heidleberg</hi> had three hundred and ſixty-five <hi>children</hi> at a birth; and the font in which they were chriſtened, is ſtill ſhewn in the great church of the town; but then theſe were children, not men. But perhaps the critique upon Mr. M'Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mott's work does not mean that the <hi>philoſophers</hi> and authors are <hi>in</hi> poor <hi>Arabella</hi> in a ſtate of <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> but only in <hi>Spirit,</hi> which the author of the <hi>Female Monitor</hi> might believe, if he admits the doctrine of <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> or tranſmigration of <hi>ſouls</hi>; for though a woman could not rightly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo many <hi>men</hi> in <hi>ventra ſemere,</hi> corporally, yet ſhe might entertain them <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> as may be proved from the number of <hi>devils,</hi> ſometimes a whole <hi>legion</hi> together, which have <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> perſons in former times.—CATHARINE MAC.

                                 <p>The FEMALE MONITOR certainly demands the <hi>tear</hi> of <hi>admiration,</hi> whenever admiration <hi>weeps</hi>; but I cannot think there was much ſentiment in the author's plucking the <hi>laurel</hi> from the <hi>Monk of Calais,</hi> by which I ſuppoſe he muſt mean "<hi>the few ſcattered white hairs upon his temples.</hi>"—</p>

—This comedy wants <hi>novelty,</hi> it being acted every hour, in every great houſe, in every great ſquare, and every great ſtreet in this great metropolis; and therefore as human nature is invariable, the merit of the author of the MAN OF THE WORLD, conſiſts in nothing more, than exhibiting in dramatic form and dialogue, the cuſtoms and habits, which have unavoidably taken place, and characterize the hiſtory of the day.</p>
               <p>Having touched a little upon <hi>imitation</hi> and literary thieving, I will now ſtate a few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arranged thoughts on <hi>ſimilarity</hi> of thinking.—</p>
               <p>The <hi>variety</hi> we ſee in the perſons, in the faces, and in the modes of thinking, which diſtinguiſh the individuals who compoſe the human animal, are aſtoniſhing! But <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>contraſt</hi> in the appearance and manners of man, are neceſſary to the purpoſes of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhew the infinite wiſdom and infinite power of his Creator.</p>
               <p>From variety and contraſt of perſon we judge of proportion, and the elegance of ſymmetry.</p>

               <p>So that it may be ſaid, that the knowledge of all arts, and the knowledge of all ſciences, which include the knowledge of all things, is the conſequence of variety in our modes of thinking, and contraſt in our opinions; which variety and contraſt, ſtimulate us to controverſy and experiment. And as <hi>virtue</hi> would not have been known but for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt of <hi>vice,</hi> nor <hi>colours</hi> but for the <hi>variety</hi> of their <hi>ſhades,</hi> neither would arts nor ſciences have been known, had the organs of mankind been ſo formed that <hi>every</hi> individual ſhould think alike.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding the verſatile ſportings of nature in forming her creatures, we often find a ſtrong ſimilitude of perſon, a ſtrong ſimilitude of face, and a ſtrong ſimilitude in

               <p>HAVING arrived at WINDSOR, and handed the lady out of the coach into the inn, we were ſhewed into a parlour by the landlord, in his proper perſon. Here a very ſerious difficulty ſtarted, which never occurred, at leaſt to me, during the whole courſe of the journey.—How am I to part with my fellow-traveller, thought I—Ay, "there is the rub," and a ſevere rub it was —I was totally ignorant of the lady's name —the lady was totally ignorant of my name. —It is true, I knew <hi>ſomething</hi> about her, but a motive, in which curioſity had the ſmalleſt ſhare, made me wiſh moſt ardently to know <hi>every thing</hi> about her.—No ſooner had I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

               <p>WE ſtood in a parlour of the inn, our hands locked within each other.—It would be hard, Madam, ſaid I, ſighing, after the pleaſant journey we have experienced, to part as ignorant of each other as we met.— It ſhall not be my fault, ſaid the lady, if we are not longer acquainted; I am come to ſpend a few weeks at Windſor, and if you wiſh to continue an intimacy, which <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> produced, and, added I, interrupting her, which <hi>love</hi> aſſiſted.—Love! alas, ſaid the lady, ſhaking her head, there was no <hi>love</hi> in the caſe, our meeting, and every thing that has happened ſince we met, were the effects of <hi>accident</hi>—aſſiſted by <hi>nature</hi>; then, Madam, ſaid I, bowing, and laying my hand upon my heart—and what is <hi>love,</hi> but <hi>nature?</hi>

But I muſt ſincerely regret, that mere <hi>accident</hi> has convinced me of this truth. —How happy ſhould I have been, if a long acquaintance, matured into friendſhip and a ſeries of reciprocal obligations, had been the means of my conviction—how happy ſhould I have been, if it had been my fortune to have <hi>loved</hi> from the reſult of <hi>judgment,</hi> not from the effect of <hi>contingency,</hi> and ſhe wept.—</p>

               <p>I acknowledge, continued the lady, wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eyes, I acknowledge we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excuſeable for yielding to the ſimple authority of <hi>nature:</hi> but what have I done?

               <p>Falling upon one knee, with faultering ſpeech, I ſwore never to part from her. —Her countenance brightened, on hearing my vow—ſhe appeared happy—her looks touched my very ſoul, our happineſs was mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual—and ſurely the pleaſure which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent mind feels in the happineſs of others, is one of the moſt delightful ſenſations with which the human ſoul is bleſt.</p>

               <p>My ſervant had ſpirit, and I had always indulged him in a free exerciſe of it—he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliated my reproof, by telling me he had no orders to enquire after the name of the lady;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0063901300:99"/>
but, ſaid he, with an arch ſignificant ſmile, I know the name of the country girl, who rode with me upon the outſide of the coach. —I felt the ſarcaſm, I ſaw the fellow triumph, and could have knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Raging with vexation and diſappointment, I had the coachman called—the coachman knew nothing about her—I had the waiters called, —the waiters knew nothing about her—I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtormed, and ſnatching up my hat, was proceeding to ſally out upon an expedition of reconoitering and enquiry, when my ſervant gave a half ſmack with his mouth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me I had not ordered any thing for dinner.—</p>
               <p>I left him to indulge his own palate in the orders, but meeting the landlord in the entry, he preſented a long bill of fare—you may have, Sir, ſaid the landlord, and he run thro' his bill of fare, throwing his eyes up for my command as he repeated each article—you may have veniſon, fowls, ducks, roaſt leg of lamb, pigeon-pie, mackarel, &amp;c. &amp;c.—Do you take me, ſaid I, for an overſeer of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0063901300:100"/>
poor, or the bencher of an inn of court? Let me have a beef-ſteak—and I paſſed by the landlord.—</p>
               <p>Getting into the ſtreet, I was as much at a loſs as ever, to find out the lady, ſo enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my way to the caſtle, I ſoon found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the terrace.—</p>

               <p>LOOKING round me, as I ſtood upon the terrace, I was aſtoniſhed at the beauty of the proſpect. The air was ſerene, the landſcape inchanting, the ſky clear, except a few clouds towards the horizon, which ſet off the brilliancy of its azure, as moles do the fairneſs of the human ſkin.—Some villas lay open to the view, others were in part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and the ſun darted his mid-day beams to gild the various turrets and ſpires, which gliſtened through the ſcene.</p>
               <p>The Thames rolled his ſilvered flood in ſilent majeſty towards the ſea, enriching his bordering banks with verdure and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tints, and woods and foreſts, ſome planted by nature, time immemorial, others raiſed by the aſſiſting hand of induſtry, waved their graceful pliant branches, and ſhook their leafy

honours—obedient to every gale. Between theſe woods, meadows, paſtures, and gardens, at different diſtances, opening interminable, gave a luxuriant diverſity to the whole.</p>
               <p>Here gurgling brooks, gently meandering along their pebbly channels, pour their tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary urns into the ſovereign river—and there a rich profuſion of hillocks, tufted with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious trees, among which groups of animals grazed, ſlept or play'd in peace and happineſs, though different in their kinds.</p>
               <p>The whole cloſed with an extended ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and charmed the ſoul with delightful grandeur—</p>
               <p>Alas, ſaid I, looking round, my ſoul elevated to enthuſiaſm—it was here our greateſt Engliſh bards invoked and received the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their muſe.—</p>

               <head>THE MEETING.</head>
               <p>TURNING my head aſide accidentally, as I knocked at the door, I ſaw <hi>Maria</hi> peep over the window-blind; but when ſhewed into, the parlour, I found her ſitting with her back turned towards the door, a book in her hand, ſupporting herſelf by her elbow, which reſted on the arm of the chair. She was ſeemingly ſo loſt in meditation, that had I not ſeen her peep over the parlour-blind, I ſhould have thought ſhe had neither heard me coming in, nor had ſeen me when I was in.—I gave a loud hem—the boy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced my entrance—"the Gentleman, Madam," and he withdrew.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maria</hi> ſtarted from her ſeat as rouſed from a reverie.—I ſhould have ſuſpected her of duplicity, but the crimſon glow that fluſhed in her cheek, convinced me that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0063901300:161"/>
reverie was not a manoeuvre of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience or practiſed art, but an immediate conſequence of amiable confuſion.—</p>
               <p>The moment our eyes met, I perceived and felt for <hi>Maria</hi>'s ſituation.—Suſpicion fled, and the ardour of paſſion which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, was inſtantly checked by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſentiment.—My eyes bent down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards —the confuſion which revelled in her cheek had raiſed a tumult within her boſom. —Our feelings were mutual—our hands, guided by inſtinctive attraction, joined im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly, till a reciprocal gentle preſſure convinced us of their junction.—Paſſion ſtepped in again, but ſentiment ſtill kept her poſt—we ſighed at one inſtant, as with one breath—at one inſtant we received relief—yet to ſpeak was impoſſible—though <hi>Maria</hi>'s eyes expreſſed unutterable things—mine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps were not without expreſſion—at leaſt <hi>Maria</hi> has ſince told me ſo.—</p>
               <p>I had always an averſion to <hi>punctilio</hi>—no man in the world underſtands leſs, or pays leſs attention to thoſe who practiſe <hi>ettiquette</hi>

               <p>I led her to her chair, "Grace was in all her ſteps."

                  </note>, I changed the ſubject, by taking up <hi>Triſtram Shandy,</hi> which I had laid upon the parlour-window, and accidentally open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the page where the author promiſes a chapter upon <hi>button-holes</hi>; it is a pity, ſaid I, turning to <hi>Maria,</hi> and affecting a ſprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to relieve her ſpirits—it is a pity, ſaid I, that <hi>Triſtram</hi> never filled this chapter—do you mean the <hi>black</hi> leaf, ſaid <hi>Maria?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwered, no—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0063901300:168"/>I could never penetrate into the moral of that dark page, ſaid <hi>Maria</hi>—</p>
               <p>I do believe, ſaid I, it is an emblem of the black ingratitude of the world.</p>
               <p>Then continued Maria, ſince you do not mean the black, you muſt mean the marble page; and that page is to me as inexplicable as the other—</p>
               <p>I do not think, anſwered I, that there is any great difficulty to unravel the truths which lie myſtically hid under the veil of the marble page—I conſider it as a true picture of the <hi>hard</hi> marble <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> marble <hi>hearts</hi> of thoſe envious dull ones, who perſecuted him while living; and pray add, ſaid <hi>Maria,</hi> of thoſe unfeeling dull ones who could not underſtand or benefit by reading the dictates of his philanthropy—</p>
               <p>I reſumed the ſubject of the <hi>button-hole</hi>—</p>
               <p>Had he filled his chapter upon button-holes, ſaid I, it would have been delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table!—</p>
               <p>He would have <hi>filled</hi> it in all probability, obſerved <hi>Maria,</hi> but poor fellow, you ſhould
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0063901300:169"/>
recollect his miſfortune—you ſhould recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect he was grievouſly afflicted with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming <hi>aſthma,</hi> the whole time he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his works—</p>
               <p>I ſee the force of your obſervation, ſaid I, a man debilitated as he muſt have been, with death purſuing him at every ſtep, and ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his dart at him upon every turn, had ſomething more material to employ his <hi>mind,</hi> and of courſe employ his <hi>pen,</hi> than ſuch trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſubjects as <hi>button-holes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True, ſaid <hi>Maria,</hi> but come, you appear in perfect health and ſpirits, ſo let me ſee what you can ſay upon the ſubject—here— is a blank page, continued <hi>Maria,</hi> taking Triſtram Shandy out of my hand—here is a white blank page, turning over to chapter XXXVIII. in the IVth VOLUME; come, I will have an immediate proof of your literary abilities—</p>
               <p>So ſaying, ſhe brought pen and ink, and placing the blank chapter in Shandy before me on a table—write, write, ſaid <hi>Maria,</hi> while I go order tea—</p>

               <p>And why not a <hi>needle</hi> and <hi>thread,</hi> Sir?

               <p>The floor, which was of old oak, gliſtered with a burniſhed luſtre, and every article of the furniture had, from frequent friction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a ſhining poliſh. In one corner ſtood a tambour-frame, in another corner an apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus for painting—a grey parrot occupied a window on the right, a breeding-cage of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary-birds occupied a window on the left, and on a large marble ſlab-table, which ſtood under a long old-faſhioned pier-glaſs, two turtles billed and cooed in amorous dalliance—</p>

                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0063901300:176"/>There were alſo two tabby-cats, their fur unſullied as ermine, purring by the ſire-ſide; and a little French lap-dog, with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, big with pup, ſlumbered upon a cuſhion.</p>
               <p>The lady of the manſion exhibited as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks of female induſtry as her furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

her <hi>blind ſide,</hi> and was miſtreſs of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual motion, which gave it all the qualities of the hundred eyes of <hi>Argus</hi>; for it took within its pupil, (which was ornamented with a ſmall pearl, contraſting a <hi>coral</hi> circle that embraced the ball) not only every object in front, but every object on each ſide.</p>
               <p>Having ſketched out this virgin's perſon, (for ſhe was unmarried, had preſerved an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted fame, and was not one of thoſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites who have no pretence to chaſtity them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but by their ſeverity to the impure)— I muſt ſay ſomething of her mind, with which I ſoon became intimately acquainted. She was a wit, a ſatyriſt, a critic, and a writer,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0063901300:178"/>
with a tongue ever pretending ſervice to her neighbours, but in its qualities contrary to that of the fox, which heals; whereas the tongue of Miſs <hi>Verjuce</hi> operated upon a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as the medicine of a pretending quack, operates upon the body; and never parted it, till, as the devil left Job, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured character became a ſore all over—</p>
               <p>With this damſel ſat a military gentleman, not leſs than ſixty, whoſe regimentals of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, faced with green velvet, exhibited the faſhionable cut of twenty years paſt—His ſtature was tall, his ſhoulders broad, his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance dignified, his eye penetrating, and his face, though furrowed by time, wore a ſmile of pleaſantry, that ſhewed he had grown old with good humour, and could ſupport age with a good grace. A verna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular broad pronunciation declared him an Iriſhman, and his attentive politeneſs ſoon convinced me he had held a commiſſion of rank in a foreign ſervice. He bore a deep ſcar upon his forehead, in teſtimony of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and the <hi>croix de St. Louis</hi> pending
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0063901300:179"/>
from his button-hole by a ribband, evinced his having received, at leaſt, an honorary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the prince under whoſe ſtandard he had fought—</p>
               <p>On this object the eye of Miſs <hi>Verjuce</hi> kept continual play, which was returned by an aſſiduous attention to pleaſe on the part of the man of war.—She was his admirer, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be her's, and ſhe believed him, from the favourable opinion ſhe entertained of her merits—O <hi>Vanity!</hi> thou art a fault of the firſt magnitude in woman!—the cauſe of her greateſt misfortunes—even <hi>Poverty</hi> is not a greater enemy to her honour—and never had woman a greater ſhare of vanity than the woman I have deſcribed—ſhe was vain of her underſtanding, but that was excuſable, her glaſs could not ſhew its deformity—ſhe was vain of her perſon, that was aſtoniſhing, for the ſight of it muſt have reproved and humbled her, every time ſhe ſat at her toilet</p>

               <p>I fought for <hi>bread</hi> and for <hi>reputation,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered the Captain—the laws of my country deprived me of my inheritance, but they could not humble my ſpirit—born a gentleman, I ſcorned to degenerate into any other character.—A paſſion for ſame, ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> is the inſtinct of all great ſouls—I bowed to <hi>Maria,</hi> ſhe conſtrued my bow into an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of her ſentiment, but it was in fact, a bow of gratitude for the compliment ſhe paid my countryman—</p>
               <p>The Captain went on—I ſought for <hi>bread,</hi> I fought for <hi>reputation,</hi> and the inſtant I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0063901300:182"/>
could acquire <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>reputation</hi> under the government of my own country, I returned to her boſom; returned with as ardent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, heaven knows! as ever lover returned with to the boſom of his miſtreſs!—Miſs <hi>Verjuice</hi> for an inſtant <hi>relaxed</hi> her muſcles— But while government precluded me from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven by the road which the ſouls of my anceſtors had travelled, I could not fight for that government with zeal, even if ſhe had accepted my ſervice.—Miſs <hi>Verjuice</hi> again <hi>braced</hi> up her muſcles—and you thought purgatory, ſaid Miſs <hi>Verjuice,</hi> the high road to heaven, and gave up your <hi>eſtate</hi> in <hi>this</hi> world, ſooner than you would ſubſcribe to the <hi>geography</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> world, as laid down by the law.—Do you not think it ſtrange, Sir, continued this amiable virgin, turning her <hi>eye</hi> upon me, that a man bred to the <hi>ſword,</hi> and who has been ſpreading <hi>deſolation</hi> over the face of the earth, ſhould have ſo <hi>tender</hi> a <hi>conſcience?</hi>—</p>
               <p>I would have anſwered the lady—but there was no ſtopping the tide of the Captain's
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0063901300:183"/>
volubility; his face glowed ſcarlet—his eyes darted lightning—he roſe from his chair, and throwing himſelf into the attitude of a <hi>Cicero,</hi> addreſſed Miſs <hi>Verjuice</hi>—You are a woman, Madam—and do not underſtand the duty of a ſoldier, nor the honourable purpoſes of war. —The duty of a ſoldier, Madam, is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port juſtice, and do injury to no man—to maintain truth, and aid virtue—and let me tell you, Madam, that to repreſs the wild fury of lawleſs invaders, and by force to extirpate wickedneſs and oppreſſion from the face of the earth, has never been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed violence or ſpreading deſolation in any country or language—Robbers may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by force or death, if other means fail. Thoſe who invade private property, may be compelled to reſtitution at the bar of juſtice. But if independant ſtates have injured us, to what bar ſhall we cite them? who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to appear at our ſummons? or if they ſhould appear, who ſhall oblige them to abide by our ſentence—open force then muſt be the dernier reſort; and who will be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0063901300:184"/>
baſe, or mean enough to ſay, that under ſuch circumſtances war is not juſt.</p>
               <p>You are ſo eloquent and energetic in your eloquence, Captain, ſaid Miſs <hi>Verjuice,</hi> that it is really a pity you are not in the houſe, to aid the phalanx of <hi>ſpeaking</hi> admirals and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals—</p>

               <p>Half the people in France will be ruined by the expence of rejoicings—every houſe was

               <p>MERCIFUL heaven! exclaimed the Captain—when we reflect upon the plunder of the human ſpecies, carried on by nations calling themſelves chriſtian, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the divine maxim "do as you would be done by," boaſting the benign principles of humanity, and enlightened by the ſublime rays of holy revelation, it ſinks us, in my opinion, infinitely below the moſt ferocious beaſts of prey, for none of theſe live by the ſlaughter and calamities of their own kind.—</p>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0063901300:223"/>
debaſe human nature, or render life miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—</p>
               <p>There is but one way of accounting for this cruelty, ſaid Maria, and <hi>Sterne</hi> has hit upon it, "the poor <hi>Negroes</hi> have no one to ſtand up for them."—</p>
               <p>They are ſacrifices to COMMERCE, ſaid I—</p>
               <p>You mean to AVARICE, ſaid the Captain— COMMERCE is a mild deity, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires human victims to bleed upon her altar.</p>
               <p>—The fruits of induſtry and the fruits of the earth are her offerings. Commerce is a cure for the moſt deſtructive prejudices; where we find agreeable manners, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce flouriſhes; and wherever there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, there we meet agreeable manners.— So ſays Monteſquieu.—</p>
               <p>Commercical laws, ſaid I, arguing from the ſame author, improve manners, but they improve manners from the ſame reaſon they deſtroy them—they corrupt the pureſt morals, poliſh and refine the moſt barbarous. The ſpirit of trade produces in the mind of man a certain ſenſe of exact juſtice, but does it

not produce ſanguinary laws and rage of avarice, that overleaps all bound of juſtice, and tramples upon humanity. The total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of trade produces robbery—but is not hoſpitality moſt rare in trading countries, and is it not found in perfection among nations of vagabonds? Among the ancient Germans, to ſhut a door againſt a ſtranger, would be conſidered as ſacrilege.—</p>
               <p>I ſhall not take upon me, ſaid Maria, to determine how far ſuch nations may merit the opprobrious term you have given them, but I ſhould rather live and die among ſuch a people, than among the moſt refined; and I think this hoſpitality, which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily include in it an aſſiduity to pleaſe, is a convincing proof of the excellency of the human heart in a ſimple ſtate.—What have we got by our boaſted improvements and frivilous politeneſs, but the loſs of manly firmneſs and independence <note n="(1)" place="bottom">I could write a very long note upon this.—<bibl>ED.

               <p>The complexion of the Queen of Portugal was a bright olive—Count <hi>O'Dunn</hi> never conſidered colours—he admired the whole ſex —every colour had its attraction for him— he loved <hi>woman,</hi> becauſe ſhe was <hi>woman</hi>; and to this generous affection he bore to <hi>woman</hi> kind, may be imputed a paſſion, the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and diſintereſted, which from his youth he had entertained for an individual.</p>
               <p>The Count made his obeiſance—the Queen opened her eyes—the Count dropped the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of his eyes—a dead ſilence enſued—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0063901300:247"/>The Dutcheſs of B—broke ſilence— ſhe introduced the Count in form, as pleni-potentiary from the court of France, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting his declaration, in refuſing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his buſineſs to any perſon but the Queen in <hi>private,</hi> ſhe retired, as a woman of diſcretion ſhould—ſhut the door—fell upon her knees—and applied her eye, cloſe to the <hi>key-hole</hi>—</p>
               <p>Had Count <hi>O'Dunn</hi> been before all the male crowned heads in Europe, he would not have evinced diffidence—had Count <hi>O'Dunn</hi> been marching up againſt a battery, he would not have betrayed fear—yet the Count was ſilent, and trembled before the Queen of Portugal.</p>
               <p>Pray, Captain, ſaid Maria, perceiving I reſted at the concluſion of the laſt ſentence, what made Count <hi>O'Dunn</hi> tremble?</p>
               <p>If you do not know, Madam, you muſt aſk the naturaliſts—anſwered the Captain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maria</hi> had a quick conception—ſhe found it dangerous to require a more minute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation —ſo requeſted I would proceed—</p>

               <head>O'DUNN'S NEGOTIATION.</head>
               <p>HER majeſty of Portugal began the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, whereas it was the duty of the Count to have began—but in truth he had forgot the intereſt of the <hi>neutral</hi> powers —there was nothing neutral about him—</p>
               <p>Your prudence, Sir, ſaid the Queen, in not communicating your buſineſs to any of my miniſters, proves you worthy of your em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment —the buſineſs of politicks ſhould never be carried on through a <hi>medium</hi>—</p>
               <p>It is quite contrary in affairs of love, pleaſe your Majeſty, anſwered the Count—</p>
               <p>You are certainly right, replied the Queen, giving up all thoughts of <hi>politicks,</hi> a <hi>medium</hi> in love is to be preferred—and the man who would reach a woman's heart, muſt firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the proper <hi>medium.</hi>—The cool lover is deſpicable—an over-warm paſſion is ſeldom
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0063901300:249"/>
laſting—but I ſhould wiſh to hear your opinion upon the <hi>ſubject</hi>—</p>
               <p>It is too difficult a ſubject for me, ſaid the Count, I have attempted to diſcuſs it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and a thouſand times, but could never reach the <hi>end</hi>—love is a ſubject which defies the power of logick, of philoſophy, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks. —I have tried love <hi>every way,</hi> ſaid Count <hi>O'Dunn,</hi> and I have been told, that thoſe who have tried it ſcientifically and ſyſtematically, have found themſelves little better than <hi>fools</hi> upon the <hi>ſubject</hi>—</p>
               <p>I knew a <hi>fool,</hi> ſaid the old Dutcheſs of B— taking her eye from the key-hole— who could handle the ſubject better than the wiſeſt of them all—</p>
               <p>Bleſs me, exclaimed the Queen, throwing her eye upon the Count's <hi>forefinger,</hi> how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs have I been in keeping you <hi>ſtanding</hi> ſo long—</p>
               <p>It is my duty, anſwered the Count, to <hi>ſtand</hi> in your Majeſty's preſence—</p>
               <p>But as you are the repreſentative of a King, replied the Queen, I inſiſt upon your ſitting—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0063901300:250"/>The Count being ſeated upon a ſopha with the Queen, proceeded upon the buſineſs of the neutral powers—he preſented his <hi>creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> —the Queen of Portugal <hi>examined</hi> them —ſhe ſpoke of her obligations to England— the Count withdrew his <hi>credentials</hi> from her hand—the Queen drew them back—examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them again—the Count <hi>puſhed</hi> the point <hi>cloſer</hi>—ſtill the Queen objected, but <hi>faintly.</hi> The Count maintained his <hi>point</hi>—</p>
               <p>Your Majeſty may perceive, ſaid the Count, turning up his <hi>credentials</hi> towards the Queen, ſo as to ſhew the two <hi>brilliants</hi> the Dutcheſs of B—had mentioned, your Majeſty may perceive, ſaid he, it is a plain propoſition—</p>
               <p>The Queen of Portugal <hi>anſwered</hi>—</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>O'Dunn replied</hi>—</p>
               <p>The Queen of Portugal <hi>rebutted</hi>—</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>O'Dunn ſurrebutted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>ſubmit,</hi> ſaid the Queen—you have <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed</hi> —I give England—I give up every thing —I give up the world to your argument, Count <hi>O!</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0063901300:251"/>Before the Queen could fully pronounce the Count's name, <hi>O'Dunn</hi> had put the pen in her hand, and her Majeſty ſubſcribed to the neutral confederacy—</p>
               <p>Oh! ejaculated the Queen of Portugal—</p>
               <p>Ah! ejaculated the old Dutcheſs of B— and ſhe fell upon the floor—ſuch is the power of ſympathy, it flew through the key-hole, and hit the old Dutcheſs full on the brain—</p>
               <p>France has carried the day, ſaid the old Dutcheſs of B—opening the door, and entering the room—</p>
               <p>Upon my ſoul, but you are out now, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Count <hi>O'Dunn,</hi> as he put up his <hi>credentials</hi>—it was Ireland that carried the day—ſo making a bow, he retired, to diſpatch a courier to Paris—</p>
               <p>Now the Dutcheſs of B—having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an account of <hi>O'Dunn</hi>'s negotiation with the Queen of Portugal, to Madam <hi>D'C</hi>— Lady of the French Queen's Bed-chamber, the French Queen inſiſted, that the French King ſhould recall Count <hi>O'Dunn,</hi> from an apprehenſion, that he might be aſſaſſinated—</p>

               <head>UN PETIT SOUPER.</head>
               <p>THE evening-dew beginning to fall heavy, <hi>Maria</hi> propoſed returning home. When we arrived at the town the Captain took his leave, having previouſly inſiſted, that I ſhould accompany him the next morning at ſix, to ſee a royal chace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maria,</hi> as we walked towards her lodgings, corroborated my ſuſpicion, that the Captain was a dying ſwain to virgin <hi>Verjuice</hi>; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me of much entertainment from the hiſtory of his amours, the Captain having, for a ſeries of years, been a conſtant dangler af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rich old maids, and endowed widows of various deſcriptions—</p>
               <p>We found the cloth laid, and ſupper was ſerved in, almoſt immediately after we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the parlour—two plates upon the table in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that my company was expected,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0063901300:253"/>
and having no inclination to retreat ſuddenly, I ſat down to table with as eaſy familiarity, as if I had been one of the family—I ſaw <hi>Maria</hi> was pleaſed at the frankneſs of my conduct—and what can be more pleaſing than an unceremonious chearful acquieſcence in partaking of the hoſpitable preparations of a friend.—The ſupper would have loſt half its reliſh by a formal invitation—</p>
               <p>You muſt help yourſelf, ſaid <hi>Maria,</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wing of a duck upon her plate, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her example—</p>
               <p>Here is wine, ſaid <hi>Maria</hi>—</p>
               <p>A dumb-waiter, which ſtood at my right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, anſwered all the purpoſes of oſtentatious attendance—we ſat in the full enjoyment of liberty and ſocial feſtivity—eat, talked, and laughed, without reſtraint—</p>
               <p>I muſt fill to the brim, ſaid I, taking up a decanter of Madeira—<hi>Maria</hi> ſmiled conſent —it is to the continuance of our love, my dear <hi>Maria—Maria</hi> bluſhed—ſhe hung her head, but as ſhe hung her head, ſhe turned up her eye—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0063901300:254"/>Let it overflow, ſaid <hi>Maria,</hi> and ſhe ſighed —let it overflow—I will pledge you with all my ſoul—</p>
               <p>And I am all impatience, added I—my heart is thirſty for the toaſt—</p>
               <p>We ſipped from our brimmers—touched glaſſes, and changed glaſſes—I taſted the nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of <hi>Maria</hi>'s lip upon her glaſs—the touch had raiſed the ſparkle of the wine, and the wine had given her eyes additional luſtre— their power was irreſiſtible—I muſt quench this flame, thought I, as I ſwallowed my wine —but wine is oil to the lamp of love—the flame from my heart increaſed—</p>
               <p>I got cloſe to <hi>Maria</hi>'s ſide, and preſſed her hand—we drank again, touched glaſſes, and touched cheeks—I had thrown my arm neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently acroſs the back of her chair—my head reclined upon her boſom—<hi>Maria</hi> rung a bell that lay upon the table, the ſervant appeared, ſhe ordered him to remove the ſupper-table—</p>

               <p>DO you know, ſaid <hi>Maria,</hi> ſighing, as the ſervant left the room, that I have been thinking continually upon the cruelties, which the Captain told us were inflicted upon the poor <hi>negroes,</hi> by their mercileſs taſk-maſters— he ſays there are noble ſouls among theſe people—</p>
               <p>Shakeſpeare was of the ſame opinion, ſaid I, when he drew the character of <hi>Othello</hi>—</p>
               <p>Your ſpeaking of <hi>Othello,</hi> ſaid <hi>Maria,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds me of a paſſage in the play, which I could never underſtand—I mean that line where <hi>Othello</hi> ſays—
