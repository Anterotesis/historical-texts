            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE PUBLICK PEACE
is juſtly the concern of every
true lover of his Country, the
Warmth and Fire that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
on every ſide in its turn, and
Prompts us to fall in upon one another,
with Reſentment for Miſcarriages, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Caution againſt them, may be
juſtly ſuſpected to proceed more from
private and narrow Views, than from
that generous and broad hearted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Love to a Country which every
Man would be diſtinguiſh'd by, but
which ſo few Underſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1150300500:3"/>
No Man can be ſaid to purſue the
true intereſt of his Country, but he that
makes it the utmoſt End of all his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
to reſtore and eſtabliſh the PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICK
PEACE; This alone makes a
Nation Great, Rich, Powerful, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
Without Peace the World is a rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Bedlam,</hi> where every (<hi>Lunatick</hi>) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
is ſeparated from the reſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them Devouring and Deſtroying one
another; A great Forreſt where the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
are all Beaſts of Prey, watching
to tear one another to Pieces, the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Hunting after the Weaker, the
Greater falling upon the Leſs.</p>
            <p>Peace is the End of Society, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Government, the Conſequence of
Laws, and the Felicity of Life.</p>
            <p>By PEACE here I am to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
to be ſpeaking of the Civil Peace;
Peace at home, (<hi>viz.</hi>) with our Rulers,
and with our ſelves; and I make the
Diſtinction here, becauſe I ſhall induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
avoid entring into that Part which
has occaſioned ſo much the Breach of our
Peace <hi>at home</hi> for ſome time paſt, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
<hi>Peace</hi> as it relates to War, Alliances, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> with our Neighbours abroad.</p>
            <p>We have been miſerably divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our ſelves for ſome time. The Feud
which began in the Court has ſpread it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1150300500:4"/>
ſelf thro' the whole Nation, and has ſo
Univerſally prevail'd, that it has been
next to impoſſible for any Man, private
or publick, but much leſs the latter, to
live and call himſelf a NEUTER:
The Breach at Court in the diſplacing
the Miniſtry, tho' it was not the firſt of
the Fire, yet it was the firſt of the
Flame. The HOUSE, (<hi>Nation</hi>) was
on Fire before, in the ſecret Diſcontents
and Uneaſineſſes that poſſeſs'd the
Parties one againſt another, and which
ſhew'd it ſelf upon every Occaſion; but
it was not broken out till the diſplacing
the Miniſtry, and diſſolving the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in 1710. Then it was a perfect
Flame, which burnt out to the terror of
all good Men who wiſh'd well to their
Country; burning up all our National
Peace, embarking the whole Kingdom in
the Diſorder, and threatning to leave us a
prey to the firſt Enemy that had Hands
to lay hold on us.</p>
            <p>The Parties who bandied the Nation
againſt it ſelf, and by whoſe Rage our
Ruin was ſo near, may without making
uſe of the invidious Names given to one
another, be thus diſtinguiſhed. (1.) <hi>The
People diſplaced,</hi> who to make themſelves
popular, decry'd the Perſons and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of thoſe who had diſplac'd them,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1150300500:5"/>
ſuggeſting the Ruin of the Conſtitution,
Invaſion of Liberty, and overthrow of
the Proteſtant Succeſſion, in favour of
the Pretender. (2.) The People in Place,
who to confirm themſelves, vindicated
their diſplacing the other, by ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Male-Adminiſtration, ſelfiſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and corrupt Practices to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
of the Nation, ruining the People
by the length of the War, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them neceſſary Peace, on pretence of
obtaining it at laſt with more Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
by the Continuance of the War.</p>
            <p>I hope it will not be expected I ſhould
enter here into the Merits of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Pretenſions, and ſo make this
Tract which is deſigned for the cloſing
theſe Breaches, be a Declaration of the
carrying them farther on, taking on me
a Power of judging and cenſuring either
one ſide or other; this is no part of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler,
which is my Province at this
time; I ſhall therefore only draw two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
from the brief Account given
above of our late Diviſions, which I leave
to the Reflection of thoſe who have
been concerned.</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Old Party</hi> would never
have ſtood out ſo long, had they believed
the <hi>New,</hi> would have been able to have
maintained themſelves ſo firmly againſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1150300500:6"/>
the Vigorous and Powerful Attacks they
were to meet with.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>New Party</hi> would not have
done many things which they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to do, nor have made uſe of many
of thoſe Hands which at laſt they were
obliged to make uſe of, if the <hi>Old</hi> had
not ſtood out ſo obſtinately, and ſo long.</p>
            <p>By theſe two unhappy Incidents, the
Party War among us was both Spun out
to a greater Length, and blown up to a
greater Flame than either ſide at firſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,
or as I believe intended; till it
came to that highth that it began to be
the Opinion of ſerious and judicious Men
on both Sides, that it could never be
made up, that the Parties could never
part without Blows, and that it muſt in
a ſhort time involve us in Confuſion and
Blood.</p>
            <p>But the Iſſue as well in what is ſeen,
as in what was but juſt appearing, has
ſhewn us that things were not quite ſo bad
as we feared; and that there were yet a
Body of Men, even in the new Miniſtry,
<hi>and at the Head of it too,</hi> who tho' they made
uſe of Inſtruments for their Convenience,
yet ſaw with other Eyes than thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
ſaw with, and purſued other
Ends than they purſued.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted but there was a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1150300500:7"/>
Party of Men who were ſecretly inclin'd
to propagate the Intereſt of the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
tho' they put on a different Face in
all their Tranſactions; theſe fooliſhly,
and very weakly, flattering themſelves
that they ſhould find an Opportunity to
turn up their own Card Trump, joined
themſelves with the Party who were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt,
and as they thought for that
Reaſon ſtrongeſt.</p>
            <p>Two things were to be obſerved of
theſe Mens Conduct all the while they
were playing this Game (<hi>viz.</hi>) that (1.)
They were willing to precipitate the
publick Affairs into all the warm and
extravagant Hights they could leſt the
diſplac'd Party, finding room to hope well
of moderate Meaſures, ſhould think of
reconciling themſelves to the Miniſtry,
and coming in. (2.) They ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
the ſaid diſplac'd Party againſt the
Miniſtry, and propagated every ſecret ſtep
that might alarm them, that as they might
be more averſe to a Reconciliation on
one Hand, ſo the Miniſtry might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
on the other, not to hearken any
more to Accommodations.</p>
            <p>Thus the ſecret Party had acted till
they thought their Game ſo ſure, and
their Intereſt ſo ſtrong, that they could
overmatch any Man who they had the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1150300500:8"/>
leaſt Reaſon to ſuſpect would oppoſe
them, and aiming at no leſs than the
Prime Miniſtry, they reſolved either to
bring it into their own Hands, or if not,
then to bring it into their own Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The
End which theſe men aim'd at, as
before they ſound Impracticable as things
ſtood; the Perſon who poſſeſs'd the Power
of Prime Miniſter, having views quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from theirs, and which they were
indeed penetrating enough to ſee would
at laſt overthrow them.</p>
            <p>Their next ſtep then was to make him
uneaſy, and to render him ſuſpected; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
him with being a Presbyterian
in his Heart, inclin'd to the Whigs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken ſecret Meaſures to betray
them all to a new Scheme of Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to erect a third Party between the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
of the other two, and ſo to lay
them wholly aſide.</p>
            <p>This part they carry'd on with more
Succeſs than they at firſt expected; for
the Prime Miniſter, tho' he form'd no
middle Party as they alleag'd, yet
ſeeing evidently that they drove on at
a rate that would certainly plunge
the Queen, not only into Breaches with
her Neighbours, but with her own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
Alſo that they had views fatal to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1150300500:9"/>
the publick Peace, and founded alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
impracticable Schemes which muſt
neceſſarily ruin themſelves; I ſay, ſeeing
this was the Caſe, after in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to keep them within the bounds
of Reaſon, and Duty to their Country
and themſelves; and after having long
born the ſcandal of their Meaſures, and
been reproach'd in Publick, as if he had
been the Actor of what he ſo often, and ſo
conſtantly oppoſed, he gradually declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, yielded to the Importunities of
the Times, left them to try their own
Wiſdom, and at laſt drew entirely out
of the Management.</p>
            <p>It was not three Days that theſe Men
ſtood by themſelves, but they appeared
to be unequal to the weight they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon them, and that they were no
more capable to guide the State without
that able Head they had parted from,
than he was able by his Wiſdom and
Authority to Guide them, and keep them
within thoſe moderate Meaſures of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which alone could preſerve
them. The weakneſs diſcovered it ſelf
ſo far that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of their new Model
immediately fell aſunder, and every one
ſetting up for themſelves, they began to
fall into that Confuſion that was foretold
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1150300500:10"/>
This ſtep of the Prime Miniſter was
infinitely to his Advantage, in that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
him to the Opinion of ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Men who had been prepoſſeſs'd
againſt him for thoſe Steps which it was
now apparent were the Produce of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Faction who topt upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;
and who as it now evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
were in an Intereſt that no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Man could longer join with. It was
alſo advantageous to the Publick, that
this ſecret Hiſtory might come to light,
and that the Miſchiefs theſe hot Men
were likely to bring upon us, might be
prevented.</p>
            <p>In this Poſture Affairs ſtood when
Heaven took the Work into its own
Hand, and the Queen who was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
touch'd with the Folly and Heat of
theſe Men, had taken her firſt ſtep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Meaſures, and given the
Treaſury from them, was ſtruck with
Death to the unſpeakable Grief of all her
faithful Subjects, who albeit our Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had leſſened the common Charity of
the People one towards another, had yet
a profound Veneration, and an unfeign'd
Duty and Affection to her Perſon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been brought to it by the moſt
engaging, inoffenſive, tender and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
Treatment of all her Subjects,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1150300500:11"/>
without Diſtinction, the moſt exemplary
Life, ſteady Piety, and Beneficent mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Reign of any Soveraign that ever ſat
upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne.</p>
            <p>When the Queen was Dead, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
thing that preſented was the
LAW. By this the Succeſſor to the
Crown, and the Duty of the Miniſters of
State were ſo expereſly laid down, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who were to aſſume the Regency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and the ſevere Penalty to be
inflicted on the leaſt Neglect ſo ſet forth;
that no ſecret Deſigns of any Men, or
Party of Men could poſſibly prevent the
Proteſtant Succeſſion taking Place.</p>
            <p>This it muſt be confeſſed has confirm'd
the Opinion of thoſe who before theſe
Things happened, profeſſed themſelves
ſatisfy'd in the Security of the Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Proviſion for the Succeſſion, and
were therefore not ſo apprehenſive of the
Danger of the Pretender as others were,
who yet were ſincerely in the Intereſt
of the Proteſtant Succeſſion; I am no
more making this Tract a Defence of one
Party, than an Accuſation of the other:
It has not been equally the Opinion of all
thoſe who were really out of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Miniſtry, that they were Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of the Pretender; and much
might be ſaid to prove they muſt have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1150300500:12"/>
been Maſters of very indifferent Politicks,
if they had any ſuch Thoughts. It is
now out of the Queſtion; the Event
proves it otherwiſe; and thoſe Jacobites
who entertained Hopes of ſuch a Thing,
diſcover that they little weigh'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Settlement it ſelf, which was
ſuch, that the greateſt Friend to the Houſe
of <hi>Hanover</hi> ſcarce knew what to Deviſe
for their farther Security, except the
placing ſome of the Family here, which
they found was not practicable on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Accounts.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed theſe things only to
make Room for what Follows, I begin
upon this reconciling Foundation. The
Proteſtant Succeſſion, and the Doubts
and Fears concerning it, or concerning
who was for or againſt it, being then at
an End by the Succeſſor's being volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and freely put into actual Poſſeſſion,
(for the King tho' not yet preſent in his
proper Perſon, is yet in an actual and
legal Poſſeſſion of the Crown.) This I
ſay being done, and being done even by
thoſe very Perſons whom we have ſo often
charged with being for the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what then remains but that we ceaſe
that fooliſh ſtrife, forget the Wrongs
done to one another, and bury the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of paſt Follies in the Joy of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1150300500:13"/>
preſent Eſtabliſhment, joining together
upon a diſintreſſed Principle, to cultivate
our own Advantages.</p>
            <p>This is our only preſent Security; if we
may be perſwaded to this, we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Poſſeſſion of the Crown to the
Proteſtant Race of <hi>Hanover,</hi> againſt all
the World; if not, if we will divide
into Factions and Parties, and be ſtill tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another to Pieces, the moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
of all Pretenders may give us
trouble, the conſtant Fears of it uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the leaſt Attempt from abroad
overcome and confound us.</p>
            <p>It is hard to ſay what is now left for us
to Quarrel at: <hi>Mark ſuch as ſow Diviſions.</hi>
If any Man now would open Wounds,
and revive Party Diſſentions, what can
it be for, but to carry on a narrow Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
a private Intereſt, and make a
Gain of the Ruin of his Country?</p>
            <p>The Succeſſion is ſecured, and in that
our whole Demands are ſecured: In a
Proteſtant King, a Rightful, Lawful, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
<hi>Hanover</hi> King all we can
wiſh for is contained; the Proteſtant
Religion ſecured; the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> Reciprocally
eſtabliſhed; the Toleration of Diſſenters
is contained in a temper of Moderation;
the Laws are protected; Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1150300500:14"/>
engag'd for; Parliamentary Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
recogniz'd; every thing that was in
Danger is made ſafe, that was in doubt
aſcertain'd, that was diſputed, ſettled,
and nothing remains for us but for every
Man to <hi>Study to be quiet, and to do their
own Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any hot Man ſhall object that this
is an Exhortation Politically made to
skreen Criminals from Juſtice, and that
the late Management ſhould be enquir'd
into and examined; I ſay, ſuch a Man
ſhows what manner of Spirit he is of.
But let him be the Man to accuſe, let
him name the Crime and the Criminal,
and let him be ſure to anſwer for a falſe
Accuſation, and begin if he thinks it is
neceſſary; but then let Offenders of all
Parties have equal Juſtice, and if they
can think of beginning the new Reign
in this Manner, let them go to Work
when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But is this a time for that Work, or
rather ſince Faults on every Side are to
be found, is it now our Buſineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
our ſelves to one another, and
forget for one another the Cauſes of our
former Feuds, that we may not fall into
the like again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1150300500:15"/>
What a Stage of Parties, of Strife, of
Rage and Fury, ſhall we make the Reign
of the King to be, if we go this way to
Work? How ſhall we deprive His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of the Bleſſing and Comfort of his
Subjects, and our ſelves of the Bleſſing
and Happineſs of his Protection and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour?
And make our ſelves miſerable
under that very Influence which we
thought to make us Happy.</p>
            <p>Can we expect the King deſires to be
King, of but part of his People? do we
think he comes in loaden with Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that he will permit one half
of his People to fall upon the other, upon
the ſingle Queſtion of, who is, or is not
beſt affected to him, and moſt in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt?
That he ſhould ſet up an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
upon the Conduct of Parties before
he was King, and a Retroſpect upon the
general Behaviour of the People when he
had nothing to do with them? Will he
begin to puniſh what his benign Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
would not, and ſhed that Blood
which ſhe would have ſaved? OR on
the contrary, will his Majeſty rather be
pleaſed that all Animoſities and Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhould be bury'd in a general Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and all Party Offences laid aſleep in
an act of Oblivion, that his Subjects may
be eaſy, that none may tremble at his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1150300500:16"/>
Coming, but that he may have the
Hearts and Hands of every Subject with
him, and may be the King of all his
Peoples Wiſhes.</p>
            <p>This leads me to the firſt Important Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
mentioned in my Title, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>What
we are to expect from</hi> his Preſent Majeſty.
Let me enquire of it Negatively.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have not Reaſon to expect in
his Preſent Majeſty a raw Youth, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in the art of Government, that
knows not how or when to relax, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
the Humours of Parties, or to lead
the People he is to Govern; that muſt give
up himſelf to be impos'd upon by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
and knows not how, or where to
beſtow his Favours, or ſhew his Diſlike: I
am not complimenting his Majeſty when I
tell you the King was not born Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
nor is his Knowledge in the publick
Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> to learn: He will indeed
be a Stranger in ſome of the Cuſtoms
and Uſages of our Court, and Country,
to which he will ſoon accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
but he is not a Stranger in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a King; he has been a Soveraign
Prince many Years, and cannot be at a
Loſs to know either his Office, or Duty;
and as he will know how to avoid failing
in his part, ſo he will not be Ignorant
when we fail in Ours.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1150300500:17"/>
2. Tho' his Majeſty is a Prince of
known Benignity, and goodneſs of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and Infinitely beloved by his
own Subjects, for his Lenity and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
even where his Power is abſolute,
and where the Obedience of his People riſes
up to a Degree that we would call Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
yet I ſay we are not to expect his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will ſuffer, as has been too much the
Caſe in our two laſt Reigns, himſelf to
be trampled on, his Goodneſs and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
play'd upon and abuſed, his
wiſeſt Meaſures of Government ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu'd,
his Councils ſlighted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
I believe his Majeſty will give
us no Reaſon to do thus, and we ought
not to expect he will Patiently bear
it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ought not to expect that upon
every Malecontent Party that may think
themſelves not kindly enough treated, or
that may be turned out of Place and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as muſt often be the Caſe; we
may be permitted to Libel and Inſult
him? It is certainly the Neglect of this
part, even to a Fault, that has brought
our Pamphlets up to ſuch a Degree of
Buffoonry, and ſuch unſufferable Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that no time in the Memory of
Man, or of Hiſtory, can ſhew the like;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1150300500:18"/>
and which the even Criminal Mercy of
her Majeſty's Reign, in every Miniſtry,
gave too much Encouragement to.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange Caſe, and owing to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the looſeneſs of the Rein, with
which our Princes have always go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd;
that no ſooner has the Soveraign
here diſmiſs'd a Miniſter of State or a ſet
of Miniſters of State, but thoſe Miniſters
turn Malecontents againſt that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
they are diſmiſs'd from, lay wait
for the Miniſters that ſucceed, Watch for
their halting, throw Dirt at them on all
Occaſions, load their beſt Actions with
Scandal and Calumny, aggravate every
miſtake to a Degree of Crime, blacken
their Meaſures with the Reproach of
both Folly and Knavery, and charge
them with Treaſonable Deſigns againſt
the Liberties of their Country; in a
Word, ſtrive to render them odious and
burthemſome to the People, that a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
cry being raiſed againſt them, the
Soveraign may firſt be laſt be obliged to
part with them; nor is this all, for altho'
this Reſentment be immediately levelled
at the Miniſters of State, yet it always
Points at the Soveraign, nay, and
touches him too, ſlily inſinuating either
his Incapacity to Govern, or his Indolence
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1150300500:19"/>
in Management, his being engroſs'd in a
Favourite, led blindly by the Noſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
beſieged, impoſed upon, and the
like, all which tend to leſſen the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
in the Eyes of the Subject, and bring
Government it ſelf into Contempt.</p>
            <p>Many ways this has been our Caſe, in
the two former Reigns eſpecially, and
innumerable Miſchiefs attend the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this Nation from this one
beginning, and as all theſe have had the
greater Influence from the too great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Forbearance of the Soveraign,
giving way to the erecting Parties and
Factions in the Houſhold and Court, ſo
it is hoped we may ſay that we ought
not to expect his preſent Majeſty ſhould
ſubject himſelf, and his Adminiſtration,
to the ſame Uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen ſomething of the Engliſh
Courts in former Reigns, and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that when Miniſters of State have
been diſmiſſed, it has not been as it is
now. If the Prince for Reaſons of State
thought fit to diſmiſs his Servants, or to
change Hands in the Adminiſtration of
his Affairs, the great Man diſmiſs'd, or
the ſet of Men diſmiſt, ſubmitted; they
took it for a Misfortune to loſe their
Princes Favour, and by a Modeſt and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1150300500:20"/>
Dutiful Behaviour always ſtood ready,
and expreſs'd their willingneſs to deſerve
the return of it: Far was it from ſuch in
thoſe Days to demand Reaſons why they
were diſmiſs'd, or to raiſe Parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that came in; to undermine
them in their Stations, and bring the
Soveraign to the Neceſſity of taking them
in again.</p>
            <p>Neither did the new Servants ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in, fortify themſelves againſt thoſe
who were turned out, by endeavouring to
miſrepreſent their former Conduct to the
Soveraign, or to leſſen them in the Eyes
of the People, and thereby to block up
the Way againſt their returning into
Buſineſs. But on the contrary, they were
always ready to do Buſineſs together in
whatſoever Station of the Government
the Soveraign might be pleaſed to employ
them.</p>
            <p>Nor was ever the changing Hands in
the Adminiſtration till now, accounted
the changing a Party. Miniſters of
State fell and riſe ſingle, and alone, and
it was not found needful at the Change
of a Secretary, or of a Treaſurer, to
change Councils and Meaſures, turn out
all the Inferior Officers in the Houſhold
and Revenue, and even to all Officers,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1150300500:21"/>
Civil and Military in the Kingdom,
changing Lieutenancies, removing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of the Peace, and even in the very
Church, obſerving the Party Intereſts of
the Miniſters of State, in placing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
making or tranſlating Biſhops, and
the like.</p>
            <p>This I muſt confeſs Appears to me to
be a Foundation in the Government, of
ſomething that ſhould not be named,
and which in time if not redreſs'd, will
certainly bring all our Kings under Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
and be fatal even to Monarchy it
ſelf: How this ſhall be redreſs'd, I am
not to dictate. All that I ſay to it here, is,
that I hope we will not expect ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
under the Reign of his Preſent
Majeſty, who as we believe of him, that
he Underſtands the Nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too well to confine himſelf to the
narrow Meaſures of a Party, ſo much leſs
can we reaſonably believe he will ſuffer
himſelf to be <hi>governed by</hi> a PARTY;
which indeed would be fatal to himſelf,
and to us all.</p>
            <p>4. No more are we to expect from his
Preſent Majeſty, that he will come into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Party Reſentment, and gratify that
helliſh Paſſion of Revenge which ſome
People wiſh for, and which they think they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1150300500:22"/>
owe to their late Mortifications: This
would be to make his Majeſty a Party
Man againſt the Intereſt of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and againſt the Peace and Felicity
of his own Reign. His Majeſty will
not appear Ignorant what to diſlike, and
what to approve, what to reſent, and
what to paſs over. No doubt but many
People have taken Liberties in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Reign, which they would not
have taken had his Majeſty been upon
the Throne, it was ever ſo in every
Reign: If the Reſentment of the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
were to be puſh'd at theſe Things, as
the Reſentment of Parties would puſh
them, many People might be made unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
who for the future may perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Loyal and Faithful; and many
People may be undone, whoſe Ruin ſhall
not add one Grain to the Safety or Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of his Majeſty's Reign. I am
perſwaded every Jacobite that behaves
quietly and inoffenſively under his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
may yet hope for the ſame Security
and Protection which he enjoy'd under
King <hi>William,</hi> and Queen <hi>Anne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no Queſtion but many a Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobite
will by ſuch a merciful Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
be in time reduced to his Duty,
who by the Violence of Reſentment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1150300500:23"/>
would be continued in Enmity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be made deſperate. Here let it be
obſerved that by Jacobite I am to be
underſtood a quiet paſſive Jack, not an
intreaguing, ploting, buſy turbulent Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite;
let ſuch receive the due deſert of
their Folly, and whoever breaks the
Peace of his Majeſty's Reign, let him
neither claim or receive any Mercy.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty is a King, and not a private
Man, and when he is ſuppoſed to Practiſe
the great Vertue of Moderation it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
he will Practiſe it as a King; that
is to ſay, that it ſhall be extenſive, <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
to every Penitent, giving room to
Men to forget the Rancour of their
Spirits, and forbearing to take Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of the Folly and Blindneſs of his
Subjects. If we pretend to expect Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Extremity of the Law upon
every weak Man who has been drawn in
to offend againſt the Proteſtant Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you will make the King's Reign,
which we hope to ſee Mild and Merciful,
turn'd into a general Judicature, and all
his Enemies that would not, that he
ſhould Reign over them, ſlain before
him: A ſight which I dare ſay his Majeſty's
generous Heart would abhor, and which
might make him terrible, but would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1150300500:24"/>
never make him dear to the Britiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If
the Jacobites, who ſhall behave
Quietly and Dutifully to the King, have
thus nothing to expect that is terrible,
much leſs will any other of his Majeſty's
Subjects whoſe Crimes are not ſuch as
call for Juſtice from the Nation as a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Society. But all his Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are as it were put upon their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
and have room given to teſtify
their Loyalty and Fidelity, whether ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
or no by their future Conduct.</p>
            <p>And this Brings me to the other part
of my Subject, (<hi>viz.</hi>) how we ought to
behave to the <hi>King upon his Coming among
us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A general Anſwer might ſuffice for this
(<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>like good Subjects,</hi> Faithfully, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with Obedience and Affection; and
like good Chriſtians living under him
quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Honeſty: But this is not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extenſively to the preſent Caſe, nor
giving ſufficient Directions to the People
how to regulate their Conduct ſo as may
diſcharge their Duty as Subjects, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the Soveraign, whom God and the
Laws have ſet over them, to Rule them
not as a King only with Authority and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1150300500:25"/>
Juſtice, but as a Father of his Country,
and of his People, with Tenderneſs and
Affection.</p>
            <p>I pay no Compliment to his Majeſty
when I preſume to ſay he comes over eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way qualified both by natural Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and premeditated Reſolution to treat
us with all that Clemency, Lenity, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
and Moderation that we can
deſire: It is our immediate Duty, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to apply our ſelves to merit that
Benign Carriage, to engage him to us,
and to give him no cauſe to think his
Affection to all his Subjects ill placed.</p>
            <p>And that this Exhortation may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
in general to us all, I take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to begin with the Jacobites: Theſe,
I divide into Originals, and New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
I have that Charity for theſe laſt,
as to believe they have been drawn into
Jacobitiſm, rather from their being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to believe its Succeſs was certain,
and infallible, and that they ſhould ſo
recommend themſelves to the next turn,
than from any particular Conviction of
the Invalidity of Parliamentary Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or of the ſuperior Right of the
Pretender. Their ſlip is pardonable no
doubt on two Conditions. 1. That they
have committed no overt Act which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1150300500:26"/>
amounting to Treaſon, renders it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to reduce them not to
Obedience, but to Example: and 2.)
That they immediately reſolve to return
to their firſt Principles, and teſtify their
ſincere Repentance by a Conſtant ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Loyalty to the preſent King, till by
the length of time they may be natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
in their Obedience, and it may be
as juſt to forget their Offence as it would
be now to puniſh it.</p>
            <p>Certainly no Man that entertains the
leaſt Zeal for his Country can now wiſh,
had he no other Motive to ſee all theſe
Calamities brought upon it which an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
for the Pretender muſt now In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
it in: If the Jacobite Cauſe was
deſperate before, as to thinking Men was
apparent, it muſt be nothing but Lunacy
and Euthuſiaſm to entertain any Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of its Succeſs now. From whence
it ſeems juſt to conclude now, that he
who Joyns in an Attempt for the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at this time cannot be thought to do
it ſo much with an Eye to the Succeſs, as
to the immediate Plunder of a War, that
he may Fiſh in the troubled Water, and
catch up ſome trifle out of the Ruins of
his Country. This is one of the worſt
ſort of Incendiaries, who ſets a Houſe on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1150300500:27"/>
Fire purely and on purpoſe to rob the
diſordered Inhabitants when they are in
a Hurry and Conſternation.</p>
            <p>Now I can not think any of theſe new
Converts or ſecond-hand Jacobites, for
ſuch they are, can yet be ſo far advanced
as to ſeek the Confuſion of their Country
upon ſo vile a Conſideration as that of
ſharing the Ruins I have therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay to ſuch, but to let them ſee
their Caſe is deſperate and irretrievable, and
they will ſoon ſee what is the next ſtep
they have to take.</p>
            <p>As to original Jacobites Nonjurant, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
and openly ſo, who were ſo from the
beginning of Jacobitiſm it ſelf, I can only
ſay to ſuch, <hi>be it with you according as you
behave,</hi> I have here no room for farther
Diſcourſe with you.</p>
            <p>That the Caſe of Jacobitiſm is now
deſparate, we need but little Argument
to perſwade them to, if Poſſeſſion be 11
Points of the Law, 'tis yet more ſo of
the Throne; and I need go no farther to
Convince you of it than this. It was not
long ago when a great Man in the <hi>French</hi>
Armies laid it down as a Fundamental in
this very Caſe, that King <hi>James</hi> could
never be reſtored in <hi>England</hi> by the
Sword, but that it muſt be done by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1150300500:28"/>
dividing the People of <hi>Britain,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
way for them to bring him in
themſelves. This was publiſh'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in a Paper called the <hi>Doway Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am willing to take it for granted either
way, as the Jacobites pleaſe: If the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of Jacobitiſm be reſtored by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
at home, they need no more
than to conſult their own Reaſon; and
ſee if they can tell themſelves where their
proſpect lies: They had the Folly and
Simplicity to flatter themſelves that they
were in a Way for it lately, imagining
tho' againſt all common Sence, that the
Miniſtry were in their Intereſt. Their
Zeal for the Pretender made them blind,
and though there were a Thouſand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,
that they were only dup'd
and made Tools of, to ſerve the preſent
occaſion of the Miniſtry without the leaſt
thought of doing any thing for them as
they called it, yet ſo willing were they to
believe what they ſo weakly, though
earneſtly, hoped for, that they ſhut, out all
juſt Suſpitions from their Underſtandings
and acted with the Miniſtry as if the
Miniſtry had acted with them.</p>
            <p>But when the thing came to the Teſt,
when Heaven took the Work into his
own Hands, by removing her late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1150300500:29"/>
then it appeared how they were
miſtaken, that they had been only made
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ools of, to ſerve a turn with, and that
for the Intereſt of the Pretender, was
no part of the Project.</p>
            <p>If then there was no real Deſign in their
Favour before, no Body will be ſo weak
to ſuppoſe they are in a better State
now, and therefore I may be allowed to
ſay the Caſe of Jacobitiſm is now grown
deſparate as to the Art and Management
of Parties at home; and as to its being
propogated by Force from abroad, that
I believe the Jacobites themſelves have
deſpair'd of long ago</p>
            <p>This being the Caſe, and Jacobitiſm
being effectually ſuppreſs'd, what have
we to do with any other Diviſions? What
Bone of Contention is left among us?</p>
            <p>We have nothing to do then, but to
Unite in a general Behaviour of Duty
and Affection, and laying aſide the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of former Breache,s let the King
have their Services and Aſſiſtance of the
whole Nation, give him leave to be King
of ALL his People, give him room to
make uſe of ALL their help, to poſſeſs
all their Hearts, and have the Strength
of all their Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1150300500:30"/>
There are two principal Articles which
have been the Cauſes, or at leaſt have
been given as the Reaſons, of all our
Parties, and of all the Diviſions that have
ever happened in this Nation; and
which as they would be effectually taken
away by this Unity and Agreement of
the Nation in their Behaviour to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Majeſty: So if any Contention or
Strife happened among us after it, the
World would plainly ſee it was a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Deſign to undermine the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and diſturb the publick Peace, and
with any juſt Foundation, theſe two
Articles are; 1. The Danger of the
Pretender. 2. The Danger of the Church:
both theſe I ſay would be taken away in
a Firm and reſolved Loyalty, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the King, his powerful Hand
ſtrengthened by the Affections of his
People to him, and they made invincible
by their Union, with one another, would
ſecure us againſt the firſt, and his Zeal
for the Preſervation of their Right, in all
its Parts would prevent the Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the laſt.</p>
            <p>In his Majeſty's Zeal for the publick
Good, and watchful concern for its Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
all Danger from Enemies abroad, or
from Parties at home will be taken away,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1150300500:31"/>
all State Jealouſies bury'd, and all Party
Animoſities bury'd. The Danger of the
Pretender will be loſt, the very Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of it will dye, a brave and a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naimous
Prince at the Head of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Nation can leave us no room for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
nor the Friends of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
any room for Hope: Popery, and
Jacobitiſm muſt no more ſhew their
Faces, or have the leaſt Pretences for their
Cauſe; let them make what Efforts they
can, they will be Laught at by the World:
Not the Power of the <hi>French,</hi> or of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchies, whether united or
not United, can give us any Uneaſineſs
in that part; we ſhall be always ready,
and always able to Encounter them.</p>
            <p>No more can that other Amuſement,
<hi>the Danger of the Church,</hi> have any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
among us, unleſs it be founded in
Parties and Diviſions; which Parties and
Diviſions will bring in all the Miſchiefs of
the former Reign, and make his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Days as unhappy and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as thoſe of his Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>But this general Union of Affections
would remove all Jealouſies, prevent that
State Plague of governing by Parties, it
would diſſolve Teſts and occaſional Bills
upon the Arms of the Government, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1150300500:32"/>
Embrace all its Subjects with an equal
Affection; and open the Heart of the
governed to ſuch a Faithful and Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Behaviour, that every ſort of Men
being true Lovers of the eſtabliſh'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
could not be capable of any
Deſigns to its Prejudice.</p>
            <p>This is the Moderation I am recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending,
and this alone. I am not plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to cover any Man whom Juſtice ought
to puniſh, let the Law have its Courſe
upon all; let none miſtake me. But if
we would make the Nation and the King
Happy, enable his Majeſty to Rule
Happily and Gloriouſly, we muſt reſolve
to bury this Party temper, this Spirit of
Animoſity and Envy that is among us; to
be one eaſy People under the Reign of
one Glorious King.</p>
            <p>I can moſt plainly perceive that there
are a ſet of People who begin to move
among us already with the ſame Spirit
which has ruined us, as to our Peace, once
or twice before, who not knowing <hi>what
Spirit they are of,</hi> begin already to be <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for Fire from Heaven;</hi> and will think
they are highly injur'd, and reſent it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
againſt a new Adminiſtration, if their
Party Reſentments are out aveng'd on
thoſe who they ſingle out for Objects of
Juſtice, as they call it; and if the King
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1150300500:33"/>
does not immediately fall upon all thoſe
that they ſhall take upon them to call
Enemies of the Succeſſion whether it
were really ſo, or no.</p>
            <p>In their ſeveral Pamphlets which they
continue to publiſh upon that Head, they
are already whetting the Edge of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Temper, and ſuggeſting that thoſe
People who contrary to former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
appear to be heartily in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Preſent King only feign to
be ſo.</p>
            <p>As to the general Conſent of all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as well in the Miniſtry as out of it,
to proclaim the Proteſtant Succeſſor, they
ſay it was not in the Power of any to
withſtand it; that the Acts of Parliament
had made ſuch effectual Proviſion to ſettle
an immediate Adminiſtration, and that
in ſuch Hands as were certain to put that
Settlement in Execution; and had added
ſuch ſevere Penalties for the leaſt delay,
or neglect of Duty in that Caſe, that no
Man could ſtir in Favour of a contrary
Intereſt; and therefore they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under a Neceſſity of falling in with
the Proteſtant Succeſſion, leaſt they ſhould
be fallen upon by the whole Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
who found themſelves veſted with
all the Military and Civil Authority, the
Executive Power ſuffering no Interval of
its Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1150300500:34"/>
How much this Juſtifies thoſe People
who could not ſay with the general Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that the Danger of the Succeſſion
was ſo great before, as was ſuggeſted,
tho' it might be very material to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Honeſty of the Perſons, yet
as I know it is a String which thoſe I am
now ſpeaking of do not care to have
touch'd, I therefore purpoſely omit.</p>
            <p>But I muſt take leave to ſay, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who did not go along with the late
Gentlemen in all their Warmth againſt
the Miniſtry, were yet as Sincere Friends to
the <hi>Hanover</hi> Succeſſion, as they, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
as heartily the Intereſt of his Preſent
Majeſty as they; and it will never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with his Majeſty to condemn
all thoſe as his Enemies, that did not
ſee the ſame Reaſon to Quarrel with the
Adminiſtration of his Predeceſſor as other
Men did.</p>
            <p>While I am ſaying this, and to avoid
the Reproach which theſe Men are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
raiſing, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that this is to prevent
Puniſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I give up at once every
Man to them who the Law without Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
without Party-Juſtice, without
ſtraining Facts by Innuendoes will fairly
and clearly condemn. Let them proceed
and take what Meaſures Legally can be
taken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1150300500:35"/>
But the Moderation I inſiſt upon is,
that no Man be condemn'd by Clamour
cenſur'd firſt by Party, and then ſentenc'd
by Tumult; that Prejudices be laid aſide,
and the general FEUD of Parties laid
aſleep, that ſeeing the main End is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the debate about who was for, or
againſt, unleſs they acted Criminally
againſt it, may dye, that Men may no
more be made Offenders for a Word, and
be judg'd by Negatives, that they were
NOT ſo, and ſo, and did NOT do ſo,
and ſo.</p>
            <p>If any Men are Criminal, bring them
forth, we are not ſpeaking, I ſay, of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Criminals to Eſcape, but of not
making Innocent Men Criminal, whether
they will or no, and keeping a Breach
open in our Charity, becauſe Men will
not be of our Opinion in Matters of State;
if theſe Men think they can hurt thoſe
Men by Law, who they Condemn by
the Tongue, let it be done; if nothing
elſe will ſatisfy them, let them try their
Hands with Impeachments and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for Male Adminiſtration, and let
them go back what length they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>This I ſay again is far from the Deſign
of this Diſcourſe, I ask no Forbearance,
no Indempnity for Men who are abnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1150300500:36"/>
to Puniſhment from the Law, they
that would take ſuch an Advantage of a
perſwaſive to Peace and Moderation ſhall
be defeated in it by this Challenge. We
know that too much Mercy was never
the Sin of that Party of Men we ſpeak
of. Let them do what they think they
can do by Juſtice, if they think they have
ſo great an Advantage in their Hands.</p>
            <p>But where the Law is not concern'd,
where no Breaches of Conſtitution, no
Oppreſſions, no Guilt is concerned, there
let them tell us a Reaſon why Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Charity, and a Chriſtian Friendly
Reconciliation of Parties, and an Oblivion
of that wicked Spirit of Rancour and
Malice, may not take Place among us.
WHY having the main Article of our
Proteſtant Succeſſion ſecured, our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Liberties, and Properties eſtabliſhed,
and all under the Protection of God, and
a Proteſtant King, we may not join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make that Proteſtant King Great
and Glorious, his Days Happy, and his
Reign Comfortable; none of which can
be, if we will not with a full Conſent of
all Parties Unite in his Intereſt, and in
our own. If we will not be at Peace with
one another, what Peace can be expected
for the King? How ſhall his Majeſty be
the Common Father of a Nation, tearing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1150300500:37"/>
one another to Pieces, and endeavouring to
Supplant one another in Intereſt, expoſe one
another in Character, and accuſe one another
of Crimes never committed.</p>
            <p>If we will not do this, if we will not drop
the Party Quarrel, forget the Animoſities and
Heats we have fooliſhly run into, we ſhall
all fall into Parties and Diſtractions again as
much as ever, which a true Lover of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
would tremble to think on. I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that I have often heard Men, whoſe tone
yet I have obſerved to be a little alter'd ſince,
I ſay I have often heard Men talk thus to one
another.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"I care not what they do ſo the Proteſtant
Succeſſion be but ſecur'd: I have nothing to
do with <hi>who is in,</hi> or <hi>who is out,</hi> what Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
the Queen Employs, or what ſhe
turns out, let but our Liberties and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
be ſafe, and let them but keep out the
Pretender, and we have no more to ſay."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but throw theſe Diſcourſes in the
Way of ſome People at this time, thus; <hi>SIR,
We</hi> hope all you deſired is now obtained, all
your demands anſwered. The Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
has taken Place, the Proteſtant Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
is in full Poſſeſſion, the whole Kingdom
ſeems to join with one Heart, and one Voice,
to Congratulate him, and to join together in
their Allegiance to him, what is the matter
with you that you are Not ſatisfi'd now? What
more would you have? Would you have us all
Quarrel again about who is <hi>Sincere,</hi> and who
Feigns? Whoever Feigns dare not own his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
and perhaps in time will give it over.
Shall we Quarrel, becauſe we do not think
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1150300500:38"/>
every Body as earneſt as we are our ſelves!
This would be to fall out for the ſake of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out. This would be really, and in good
Earneſt to <hi>ſow Diviſions;</hi> and depend upon it, if
you <hi>ſow Iniquity, you will reap Vanity;</hi> if you ſow
Diviſions, Diviſions will grow, you will have
a large Crop of Strife and Contention, Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Perplexity, and we ſhall ſtill be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
divided Nation, we ſhlal have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Succeſſor will have little Comfort in us.</p>
            <p>The Sum of this Diſcourſe, and the true
Deſign of the Author of it, is to recommend
to the People of <hi>Britain,</hi> to conſider their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Circumſtances, to reaſſume that Temper,
Moderation and Spirit of Union among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which has always been a Token to them
of approaching Deliverance. This is now the
only Courſe left them, and in the purſuit of
this, they can not fail of a generous Aſſiſtance
from all Men that wiſh well to the Publick.</p>
            <p>I know the hot Men of every ſide will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this, and ſome will make this uſe of it;
that as there is now a Breach made, their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
is to make the Aſſault; as the <hi>Turks</hi> at
the Siege of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> when, by Accident or
Treachery, or what other means is not known,
they found the Walls and Works of the City
all blown up on a ſuddain, they immediately
advanced to the Storm.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe who are of that Opinion in the
preſent Caſe conſider, that they make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
at the hazard of their Country, and
that as a Miſcarriage will endanger not the
Publick only, but themſelves alſo, ſo let them
remember that whoever Puſhes his private
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1150300500:39"/>
Deſign at the Hazard of the publick Peace,
ſhews that he Values his Country leſs than his
ſingle Intereſt.</p>
            <p>But what is it theſe Men call breaking in?
Breaking in upon Moderation, and upon Peace,
is making War upon your ſelves. The Support
and Preſervation of our Country's Intereſt
Depends upon a Steady, Wiſe, and Calm Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
not ſtraightned by the narrow
Meaſures of Parties; for Government is above
Parties, and ought to be preſerv'd in its juſt
Superiority to all private Deſigns; the only
Limits of Government are the Laws, and the
only end of Government is the publick Good.</p>
            <p>The time is now come for us, all to act
with a new Spirit, the War is over, <hi>let the
Spears be turned into pruning Hooks,</hi> let the
Rage abate, for the Conteſt is at an End, let
us <hi>Study to be Quiet, and do our own Buſineſs;</hi> if
any Man would ſow Diviſion, let us <hi>Mark that
Man,</hi> and have no Communication with him.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe who have offended, <hi>who</hi> as above
<hi>I freely give up,</hi> if the Law can take hold of
any, <hi>it is open,</hi> any one may have Recourſe
to it. I doubt not his Majeſty comes in
with a temper of Clemency, and as <hi>SA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi>
when he was proclaimed King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when
the Party-men would have had him reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Conduct of thoſe who would not have
had him <hi>to have reigned over him;</hi> if even any
offending Jacobite is found, that Text and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
recommends them, <hi>if Penite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

Majeſty's Royal Mercy. 1. Sam. 11. 13. <hi>And</hi>
