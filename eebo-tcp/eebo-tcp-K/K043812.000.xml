            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THERE are many undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and irrefragable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to ſupport my nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
but, as <hi>Vellum</hi> ſays, Out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral,
I ſhall only mention a few.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0793600300:5"/>
I need not, in this caſe, beg a
queſtion, which will readily be granted,
and therefore I ſhall take it for granted,
that all perſons, who go to the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
go there for Entertainment, in
order to hear and ſee every thing and
every body. If I read Mr. <hi>Palmer's</hi>
name in the bill of the <hi>way of the
world</hi> for <hi>Mirabel,</hi> I go with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
that I ſhall ſee and hear him
with entire ſatisfaction, and ſo of Mr.
<hi>King,</hi> in the part of <hi>Atall,</hi> in the <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gallant</hi>; now in neither of theſe
plays, nor in many others does Mr.
<hi>Garrick</hi> intrude upon my entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor obſtruct my ſatisfaction,
becauſe he does not play in them:
But when I go to ſee the <hi>Suſpicious
Husband,</hi> there I ſee Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> in
the part of <hi>Ranger</hi>; and ſure no man
will deny, but that he plays that part,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0793600300:6"/>
better than any other man in the world;
But will any perſon be ſo hardy as
to tell me, I ſhall part with my money,
to ſee <hi>honeſt Ranger</hi> only; I want to
ſee <hi>Frankly</hi> and <hi>Bellamy</hi> and ratling
<hi>Jack Meggot</hi>; I would willingly ſee
Mr. <hi>Strictland</hi>; the character, who gives
title to the Comedy, yet am I herein
debarred, by Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>'s inſtruſion,
for when he appears on the ſtage, I
am ſo blinded, either by prejudice or
admiration, that I can ſee no body
elſe; I can hear no body elſe; I can
bear no body elſe; for inſtance, the
other day, I wanted to hear <hi>Jacky
Meggot</hi> invite <hi>Ranger</hi> and his friend
in the <hi>Italian</hi> taſte, to his houſe, but
I never heard a ſyllable of it.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ranger</hi> is with his two friends,
<hi>Bellamy</hi> and <hi>Frankly,</hi> I hear him indeed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0793600300:7"/>
ſpeak of them, and I am as much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pized
to find him ſpeaking <hi>to</hi> them,
but I can never ſet my eyes on them,
while he is by: Before he came in,
I could ſee and hear them, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly,
and as clearly, as viſibly and
audibly as ever I ſaw or heard any thing
in all my life, but when he comes in,
whether it is, that he clouds my eyes,
or fills my ſight, I cannot for my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
but I ſee no more of <hi>Bellamy</hi>
and <hi>Frankly.</hi> If they <hi>are</hi> there, I
do not hear them, and though I uſe
my glaſs I cannot ſee them, till he goes
out again.</p>
            <p>I hear him ſay (plain enough)
<hi>Now it is, dear boy, and honeſt Ranger,</hi>
and <hi>juſt now you would have cut my
throat</hi>; but I never heard that they ſaid
any ſuch words, but from his report,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0793600300:8"/>
I ſuſpected my own hearing, nor I
would not believe my own eyes, till
I aſked a gentleman who ſat by me,
whether <hi>Frankly</hi> or <hi>Bellamy</hi> were on
the Stage, and he ſaid that he could
not ſee any ſuch perſons.—Then,
ſaid I, who the devil is he ſpeaking to?—By my ſoul, replied the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
I can't tell, for I ſee neither
of them, nor do I believe either of
them to be on the ſtage: if they are, it
is more than I can ſay, and I am as
uneaſy as you can be to ſee one man
play the whole comedy by himſelf;
it is really too hard upon him, and I
can't find the reaſon why he keeps ſo
many people in ſallary to ſo little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and almoſt for doing nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0793600300:9"/>
I came here the other night, when
Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> did not play, and I ſaw
every body, and heard every thing to
my entire ſatisfaction; but when this
confounded <hi>Garrick</hi> comes on the
ſtage, he confounds my eyes and ears
in ſuch a manner, that I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of both organs, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
engroſſed by his appearance and
voice.</p>
            <p>When my ſide's-man had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I aſked a lady, who ſat by me,
Who Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> was ſpeaking to? She
ſaid, She could not tell.—When he
ſays, <hi>any letters,</hi> or <hi>meſſage?</hi> does he
ſpeak to the ſcene? for by the lord, I
ſee no ſervant! She ſaid, She thought
her eyes pretty good, and that ſhe was
as blind as myſelf in that reſpect—and indeed ſhe had the higheſt pair of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0793600300:10"/>
eyes that ever my eyes beheld; yet clear
as her viſion was, ſhe could ſee no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
nor any thing elſe, but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual,
<hi>Garrick</hi>—He is not of ſo
gigantic a ſtature, nor do I think he
ever will exceed ſix feet in height; he
is not ſo fat as Sir <hi>John Falſtaff,</hi> and
how the devil, does this manager ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
to cover every body and every
thing from our ſight.—He muſt
deal in magic, thus to interpoſe between
the ſpectators and every body elſe, in ſuch
a <hi>black art</hi> manner, as render them invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>He is the reverſe of a dark-lanthorn
which hides the bearer, and throws light
upon every body elſe; he is like the
focus of a glaſs, which attracts all the
rays of light; he is like a ſun-dial, which
interprets time by light and ſhade—him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0793600300:11"/>
all <hi>light,</hi> every body elſe all
<hi>ſhade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a repreſentation may be called a
picture, but no good picture was ever
all light, and all ſhade, but both ſhould
be happily compounded and mixed to
make a picture agreeable and ſtriking.</p>
            <p>I, like a fool, the other night, went
to ſee the <hi>Alchymiſt:</hi> I ſaw <hi>Burton</hi> and
<hi>Palmer</hi> plain enough, till <hi>Abel Drugger</hi>
came on, fiddling with his ſhop-keeper's
apron. He no ſooner came on than
away went <hi>Subtle,</hi> and captain <hi>Face</hi>:
ſays I, to one near me, is not this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous,
that <hi>Subtle</hi> and <hi>Face</hi> ſhould go off
the ſtage, at the time when <hi>Nab</hi> wants
them He anſwered, that he thought
it unaccountable, and that he was ſerved
ſo once before the laſt ſeaſon; and that
if he had recollected himſelf in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0793600300:12"/>
he would not have come to ſee
<hi>Abel Drugger</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>You know the plot, ſays he, is mixt,
and has a variety of perſons in the drama,
but the devil a one perſon here, but
<hi>Abel Drugger.</hi>—You ſhall ſee him fight
a parcel of <hi>Shadows,</hi> and beat them off
preſently: He is excellent at <hi>Skiomachy.</hi>
He did ſo, in a very ſhort time, beating
the air, with as much dexterity, as if
there had been a dozen people on the
ſtage: Well, ſaid I, to the gentleman
near me, I don't like this egotiſm, for as
<hi>Young</hi> the ſatyriſt expreſſes it,<q>
                  <hi>and I's</hi> the little hero of each tale.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another cogent reaſon, I ſhall offer to
the public, and you, ſir, why Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
ſhould <hi>not</hi> appear on the ſtage is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0793600300:13"/>
that beſides blind-folding people, by his
faſcination, he impoſes upon our hearing,
rendering us deaf to every other perſon,
but himſelf.—This is an intolerable <hi>mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,</hi>
thus to ſeize upon, and captivate our
two ſenſes.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken to that of ſight already,
and now I ſhall enter upon that of
hearing.</p>
            <p>We have had occular proofs ſufficient
to convince all reaſonable people, that is,
all people that will believe their eyes,
that Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> ſhould not appear upon
the ſtage. Had he happened to be an
actor in <hi>Paris,</hi> he would long ſince, have
been put into the Baſtile, but as he lives
under ſo mild a government as that of
<hi>Great-Britain</hi>; the beſt we can do, is to
put him under the puniſhment of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0793600300:14"/>
or in other words to baniſh
him the ſtage, the ſcene of his delinquency,
nor is it indeed reaſonable in the nature
of things to permit him to reign any
longer in ſo unlimited a tyranny, a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
for which ſome men, would long
ſince have been brought to the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
            <p>I moſt wonder, why his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
have not entered into a formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
againſt him, and brought their
<hi>habeas corpus,</hi> for rendering them invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
and inaudible: they permit their
names to be printed, which is a kind
of bond, or promiſſary note, payable to
the public, that they will enact ſuch,
and ſuch characters; now if Mr. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
or Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> or any of the players,
engages thus in print to perform this or
that part, and does not appear, when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0793600300:15"/>
               <hi>Garrick</hi> comes on, have not I my writ
of inſolvency againſt him; what can they
plead why I ſhould not oblige them to
appear, when Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> comes on.—Why do they go off that inſtant.—There's no body in the galleries, find
any fault with them; they, and every
other actor or actreſs in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> have
their peculiar merits in their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
caſt. Each has his proper walk, and
ſhines in his own department; and the
next time I ſee them diſappear on <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick's</hi>
entering, I ſhall ſay with the witches
in <hi>Macbeth, appear, appear.</hi> So I give
them this fair warning.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> ſays in <hi>Hamlet</hi>—<hi>I am too much in the Sun</hi>; he ſpeaks an
evident truth, and if I may be allowed
the Expreſſion, a <hi>palpable</hi> one. It is
downright demonſtration.—He is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0793600300:16"/>
               <hi>too much in the ſun</hi>; what he ſays needs
no illuſtration, for he is <hi>ſo much in the
ſun,</hi> that he takes all the light to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and like a ray of glory, or an <hi>infula</hi>
of beams, eclipſes all others.</p>
            <p>The moon herſelf, and moſt of the
ſtars, who borrow their light from the
ſun, have not ſo much reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain:
If they have not light of their
own, they ſhine in borrowed robes, but
they would take it very ill of <hi>Dan Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
               <hi>that wandering knight ſo fair,</hi> if he
ſhould, like <hi>Garrick,</hi> get up of a froſty
night, put on his damaſk night-gown,
and then put them all out.—It would
be as cruel in the <hi>ſun</hi> to do ſo, as it is
in <hi>Othello,</hi> when he <hi>puts out the light,
and then puts out the light.</hi> And I
think, with deference to the judgment
of the public, that it is as inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> to extinguiſh all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0793600300:17"/>
other lights but his own: and I hope
they will take proper cognizance, and
jointly agree to put him out by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
votes of oſtraciſm.</p>
            <p>I will only aſk the company of <hi>Drury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi>-houſe,
has the manager, (as <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
did of old to his diſciples) enjoin
them ſilence for any term of years. If
he has done this in his wiſdom, 'tis but
reaſonable, he ſhould ſet them an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.—He ſhould, like a good father,
enforce by his <hi>precedent,</hi> what he preaches
in doctrine, and not like an incendiary, <hi>ſet
us all by the ears</hi>; and like the ſentence
of perjury, impoſe the <hi>pillory</hi> upon his
audience. I muſt own, that I am ſo
great a lover of muſic, that I could ſit
a whole hour to hear a good <hi>ſolo</hi>
performed by a good hand, but by the
blood of the <hi>Mirables,</hi> I do not ſee
why Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> ſhould every night for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0793600300:18"/>
theſe many ſeaſons, play nothing but <hi>ſolos.</hi>
This is rehearſal upon rehearſal, and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the back of repetition. Are we
never to have a concert, becauſe truly
Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> loves nothing but <hi>ſolos.</hi> I
think Mr. <hi>Holland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Bransby,</hi> and indeed every Mr. and
Mrs. in the houſe have a juſt title to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their particular parts in the theatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
concert.</p>
            <p>They are paid for doing ſo; we
the public pay them, and we inſiſt
on their playing for the future, or we
will pay them, and repay them.—Had
we found fault with their perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
at any one time, had we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
their theatrical merit, whether
natural or acquired, if we had refuſed
to give them, what is their undoubted
right, our juſt applauſe, they might offer
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0793600300:19"/>
ſome plea, for not diſcharging their duty,
but as matters ſtand, we think this time
as ſeaſonable as well as unſeaſonable;
ſilence is inſenſible, and we hope to
ſee a reformation in due time, which yet
we think cannot well be made, except
Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> begins it by a ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from the ſtage, ſince we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<hi>Horace</hi>'s ſaying to him,<q>
                  <l>Luſiſti Satis—</l>
                  <l>Tempus abire tibi.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall now ſtate ſome matters
of fact, in order to ſupport our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>One matter of fact is, that when he
played <hi>Hamlet,</hi> no body elſe appeared,
when he was on. Our attention was
ſo much engroſſed by <hi>Hamlet,</hi> that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0793600300:20"/>
we took no notice of any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
I neither ſaw <hi>Bernardo</hi> nor <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi>
nor heard one ſyllable of either
<hi>Roſenerans</hi> or <hi>Guilderſtern,</hi> while <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
was on.—When <hi>Hamlet</hi> ſays,
<q>—The play's the thing.</q>
With which I'll catch the conſcience of
the thing we expected; there would
have been a play, but if there was any
ſuch thing, I did not ſee it or hear
it; it might have been play'd for any
thing I know, but certain it is, it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
me. Poſſibly, I was gazing too
attentively on <hi>Hamlet</hi> ſitting at the feet
of <hi>Ophelia,</hi> and looking at ſomething
through her fan.—I knew that the
object of his intuition was to have been
the <hi>King,</hi> but the devil a king was there,
or if there was it, was a king of Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let's
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0793600300:21"/>
own making; like that, when
he ſays,
<q>
                  <hi>A</hi> King of ſhreds and patches.</q>As in like manner, in the <hi>Alchymiſt,</hi> is
it fitting, that <hi>Abel Dugger,</hi> ſhould play
the whole play himſelf, and let no one
elſe be ſeen or heard, while he's on?
If monopoly in trade be an injury to
the public, then it muſt be confeſſed,
with reſpect to our entertainments, a
theatrical monopoly, is an unfair mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly,
an embargo on our taſte, a kind
of an inquiſition, a very ſtar-chamber on
our underſtanding; and if trade in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ſuffers by ſuch monopolies, ſo is
taſte in general utterly depraved by ſuch
unjuſt engroſſment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0793600300:22"/>
Why ſhould not the witches be ſeen
or heard, when <hi>Macbeth</hi> comes in, when
he ſays,
<q>
                  <l>Ye black confederate midnight hags,</l>
                  <l>What are ye doing?</l>
               </q>
Inſtead of anſwering him, <hi>a deed, &amp;c.</hi> as
they ſhould do, they inſtantly diſappear,
they vaniſh, and are no more ſeen; he
bewitches the very witches, rendering
them, and all their diabolical proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
inviſible.—The cauldron is no
more, he extinguiſhes their infernal flames,
and plays hell with hell itſelf, ſending
the very devil, as the ſentence does the
condemned criminal, to the place from
whence he came.—And is this ſufferable?
Will any man be ſo hardy as to ſay, this
is to be borne,—it is not to be borne,—
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0793600300:23"/>
I think the witches have as great a right
to anſwer, as <hi>Macbeth</hi> to aſk a queſtion;
at leaſt, I think it is ſo in your houſe,
ſir; and what is ſauce for the gooſe,
ſhould be ſauſe for the gander, as the
ſaying is; now at your houſe, there are
no ſuch proceedings, no ſuch indecorum.
He does not ſwallow up the witches,
and devour them at a mouthful. He
does not like the famous <hi>fire-eater,</hi> feed
upon brimſtone and other combuſtibles,
which reminds me of a ſtory I have
ſomewhere read, applicable to Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s
thus eating up the <hi>devil</hi> without
a grain of ſalt: I ſay, applicable to him
for one very good reaſon, and that is, if
I do not inſert it here, I ſhall forget to
inſert it any where elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0793600300:24"/>
A certain nobleman to divert himſelf,
carried a young Blackamoor juſt imported
to one of the Papiſh chapels in the
city, and when the prieſt was eating the
wafer, the blackamoor asked his maſter,
What that man was eating? Who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that he was eating his God.—I wiſh we had him in our country,
ſays the blackamoor, for he would eat
the devil purely.</p>
            <p>This ſtory needs no comment, and
therefore we ſhall make none; we hope
therefore from what we have advanced
that theſe irrefragable arguments will
have ſome weight with Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi>
and you are at liberty to ſhew this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to him: if he is able to anſwer all,
or any one of them, to our ſatisfaction,
we ſhall ſubſcribe a ſubmiſſive acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0793600300:25"/>
of our fault in the daily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſer,
with the hopes of forgiveneſs
and promiſe that we ſhall never be
again guilty in this particular, if not, we
ſhall ſay as the King in the Mourning
bride expreſſes it,
<q>Take away his face</q>For we muſt acknowledge that it daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles
our ſight, in ſuch a manner, that
we can ſee nothing elſe. Nor indeed is
any thing herein written, ſir, in the leaſt
to inſinuate any thing to the prejudice of
your houſe, which we honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
as we ſhould do, and we ſhould
want taſte did we ſay any other. Your
performers have merit enough to extort
praiſe from the beſt judges or the niceſt
criticks, and perhaps one of the beſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0793600300:26"/>
low comedians in the world is in <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is any thing herein written
intended to depreciate or run down the
Actors of <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> but the reverſe is
the intention of this letter; for if we
were hardy enough to ſay, that all and
every of them has not theatrical merit in
an eminent degree, it were to give our
own judgments the lie, and the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
like duſt thrown in the wind,
would fly in our faces—it were a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
artifice, becauſe we run down this
moſt <hi>unreaſonable man,</hi> thereby to traduce
or leſſen that good eſteem, which they
have learned by their good quallities,
or becauſe they are not ſeen, or heard
when Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> appears, that therefore
they are not <hi>fit to be ſeen, or that they
ſhould not be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0793600300:27"/>
The reverſe of all this is meant and
intended by the whole tenour, of
which however tortured to confeſs, will
never be made to confeſs what it never
intended; I ſay, it is fitting they ſhould be
ſeen or heard, and that in order thereto, we
have given this our ſafe advice to <hi>David
Garrick</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> manager of <hi>Drury-Lane</hi>
play-houſe, that he will appear no
more on the ſtage, which advice we
ſhould not have given in ſo peremptory
a manner if he did not eclipſe thoſe
who play with him. Our advice is
candid, free, and diſintereſted, ſince
it will be allowed, that as there cannot
be two ſuns, neither can there be two
<hi>Garricks,</hi> ſince he like his own <hi>Richard,</hi>
               <hi>has no brother,</hi> is <hi>like no brother.</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0793600300:28"/>He is himſelf alone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If then no ſimilarity appears, no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding
features are ſeen, upon a
compariſon, that ſuperiority of light
which, we allow him, (and which if
we did not allow him, the world would
do it for us) has raiſed him to an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
above all in the theatrical walk;
and, as a witty orange-woman ſaid to
a gentleman, who asked, Where was
his Fellow (meaning his ſervant) By
G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>, ſir, not in Chriſtendom; ſo we
may ſay of <hi>Garrick</hi>—not in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe;
and for this one material, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ſubſtantial reaſon, we exclude
him from the ſtage, that other people
may have their turn to ſhine; for if we
did with him, as <hi>Juliet</hi> ſays of <hi>Romeo,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0793600300:29"/>
Take him, and cut him out in little
ſtars, and he will make the face of
heaven ſo fine, that all the world would
be in love with night, and pay no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to the garniſh ſun.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> would poſſibly glitter
every atom and particle of him; and
like a looking - glaſs, broke into ten
thouſand ſhatters, each brittle ſhatter
would glitter, and ſparkle ſtill.</p>
            <p>So that if the other actors, eminent
as they are, each in his own walk,
will condeſcend to allow this ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
in Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> we think they
will join with us in expelling him the
houſe, as an unruly member, who takes
up ſo much box, that he elbows off
every body elſe; one whoſe voice is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0793600300:30"/>
ſo loud, that like that of <hi>Sentor</hi> the
herald, it draws ten thouſand voices,
whoſe tongues ſo voluble, that he will
not even allow the very women to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
their favourite faculty of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And ſure, when one man can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſilence upon ſo many women, a
taſk above the power of all the husbands
in England, or in the world, to perform,
what muſt we think of ſuch a ſway?
ſuch a diſpotic ſovereign, arbitrary rule,
ſhould not be veſted in any ſubject;
and it is more than the Grand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narque,
Lewis himſelf would dare to
do in France, where his motto is,
Sic <hi>volo, ſic Jubeo,</hi> nay, his favourites
Pompadour would not obey ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
a command; and if he had
the confidence to proclaim ſilence in a
printed edict, or declaration of his will,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0793600300:31"/>
he would in all human, all moral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
raiſe an army of female inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
to rebel againſt his throne, and
like Sampſon, pull an old houſe over
his ears; we are delighted with the
ſweetneſs of the female voice, as they
are the moſt harmonious; and ſhall
Mrs. <hi>Cibber,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Pritchard,</hi> Mrs.
<hi>Clive,</hi> Miſs <hi>Macklin,</hi> and the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes,
give up a privilege they have a
right to enjoy, a perogative they have
maintained ſince the days of old mother
Eve, who, no doubt, enjoyed it in its
full extent; nor ſhall we join with
Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> or any other man, or ſet
of man in the kingdom, to impoſe
this unreaſonable injunction on women,
who have given us ſuch uncommon plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
either in the tender or the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
tones of their voices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0793600300:32"/>
It would be an act more cruel than
caſtration to men, by which the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
equip their children for the opera,
and I will ſpeak for any of the above
actreſſes, and promiſe this in their name,
that they would think ſuch <hi>dilapidation</hi>
for procuring men, a voice would be
leſs cruel, than to take the voice of
women by any means; nay, I will
vouch for them all, that they would
rather be martyrs, and ſuffer themſelves
to be <hi>ſtoned to death,</hi> as the Italians are
<hi>ſtoned for life,</hi> than to ſuffer the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of ſo rich a treaſure, or to cede,
by what treaty ſoever, upon any terms
or conditions, clauſe or clauſes, that
high and mighty female right, the uſe
of their tongues; and therefore we ſtill
continue to affirm, as we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proved our aſſertion, by many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0793600300:33"/>
reaſons, that this unreaſonable man,
<hi>David Garrick,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſhould Not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
on the ſtage; and we hope you
will ſhew him this letter; nay, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
it of you, and his abdicating
the throne of his anceſtors, and reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his theatrical authority (we don't

            <p>SOMETHING I intended to
ſay when I firſt ſat down to write
this epiſtle, but it ſlipt my memory, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the zeal I entertain for exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
Garrick, and has again this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
occured to me.</p>
            <p>In the name of common-ſenſe are
we to have nothing new at your houſe,
is variety never to pleaſe our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0793600300:35"/>
ſhall we neither have a new
play, nor a new performer, but will
you perſiſt, and again lead us through
that beaten path we have all theſe ten
years walked in?</p>
            <p>If we have not ſomething new form
you within this mouth, I ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to give my vote, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Garrick at Drury-lane.</p>
            <p>Now Sir after having requeſted of
you ſomething new, I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to your memory ſome account of
Mademoiſelle de Clairon, a celebrated
actreſs at Paris, of whom you doubtleſs
have heard; I mean by giving you this
account of her, that you may inſtruct
the novices that may offer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0793600300:36"/>
Her firſt appearance is exceſſively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging;
ſhe never comes in ſtaring round
upon the company, as if ſhe intended to
count of benefits of the houſe, or at
leaſt to ſee, as well as be ſeen. Her
eyes are always, at firſt, intently fixed
upon the perſons of the drama, and
ſhe lifts them by degrees, with enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diffidence, upon the ſpectators. Her
firſt ſpeech, or at leaſt the firſt part of
it, is delivered with ſcarce any motion
of the arm; her hands and her tongue
never ſet out together; but the one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
us for the other. She ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
begins with a mute, eloquent
attitude; but never goes forward all at
once with hands, eyes, head, and voice.
This obſervation, though it may appear
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0793600300:37"/>
of no importance ſhould certainly be
adverted to.</p>
            <p>By this ſimple beginning ſhe gives
herſelf a power of riſing in the ſcene.
As ſhe proceeds, every geſture, every
look acquires new violence, till at laſt
tranſported, ſhe fills the whole vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
of the part, and all the idea of
the poet.</p>
            <p>Her hands are not alternately ſtretched
out, and then drawn in again, as with
the ſinging women at Sadler's-wells; they
are employed with graceful variety, and
every moment pleaſe with new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
eloquence.</p>
