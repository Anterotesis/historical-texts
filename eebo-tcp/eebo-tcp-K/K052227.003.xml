            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>WE have here a new Scene of Action opened; the Poet has hitherto given us an Account of what happened by Day only: the two following Books relate the Adventures of the Night.</p>
                  <p>It may be thought that <hi>Homer</hi> has crowded a great many Actions into a very ſhort Time. In the ninth Book a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is conven'd, an Embaſſy ſent, a conſiderable Time paſſes in the Speeches and Replies of the Embaſſadors and <hi>Achilles:</hi> In the tenth Book a ſecond Council is call'd, after this a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is held, <hi>Dolon</hi> is intercepted, <hi>Diomed</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> enter into the Enemy's Camp, kill <hi>Rheſus,</hi> and bring away his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: And all this done in the narrow Compaſs of one Night.</p>
                  <p>It muſt therefore be remember'd that the ninth Book takes up the firſt Part of the Night only; that after the firſt Council was diſſolv'd, there paſs'd ſome time before the ſecond was ſummon'd, as appears by the Leaders being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by <hi>Menelaus.</hi> So that it was almoſt Morning before <hi>Diomed</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> ſet out upon their Deſign, which is very evident from the Words of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> Book. 10. ℣. 251.<q>

                     <hi>Homer</hi> has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> and others, to have been guilty of an Error, in ſaying that <hi>Zephyrus</hi> or the Weſt Wind blows from <hi>Thrace,</hi> whereas in Truth it blows toward it. But the Poet ſpeaks ſo either becauſe it is fabled to be the Rendezvous of all the Winds; or with reſpect to the particular Situation of <hi>Troy</hi> and the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea. Either of theſe Replies are ſufficient to ſolve that Objection.</p>
                  <p>The particular Parts of this Compariſon agree admirably with the Deſign of <hi>Homer,</hi> to expreſs the Diſtraction of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> the two Winds repreſenting the different Opinions of the Armies, one Part of which were inclin'd to return, the other to ſtay. <hi>Euſtathius.</hi>

Opinion; as is alſo Monſieur <hi>de la Motte,</hi> who argues as if he had read him. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Agamemnon</hi> (ſays he) in the ſecond Iliad thought himſelf aſſured of Victory from the Dream which <hi>Jupiter</hi> had ſent to him, and in that Confidence was deſirous to bring the <hi>Greeks</hi> to a Battel: But in the ninth Book his Circumſtances are changed, he is in the utmoſt Diſtreſs and Deſpair upon his Defeat, and therefore his Propoſal to raiſe the Siege is in all Probability ſincere. If <hi>Homer</hi> had intended we ſhould think otherwiſe, he would have told us ſo, as he did on the former Occaſion; and ſome of the Officers would have ſuſpected a Feint the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe they had been impos'd upon by the ſame Speech before. But none of them ſuſpect him at all. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> thinks him ſo much in earneſt as to reproach his Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, <hi>Neſtor</hi> applauds <hi>Diomed</hi>'s Liberty, and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> makes not the leaſt Defence for himſelf.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Dacier</hi> anſwers, that <hi>Homer</hi> had no Occaſion to tell us this was counterfeit, becauſe the Officers could not but remember it to have been ſo before; and as for the Anſwers of <hi>Diomed</hi> and <hi>Neſtor,</hi> they only carry on the ſame Feint, as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> has prov'd, whoſe Reaſons may be ſeen in the following Note.</p>
                  <p>I do not pretend to decide upon this Point; but which way ſoever it be, I think <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Deſign was equally anſwer'd by repeating the ſame Speech: So that the Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at leaſt is not to be blamed in <hi>Homer.</hi> What obliged <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to that Feint in the ſecond Book was the Hatred he had incurred in the Army by being the Cauſe of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Departure; this made it but a neceſſary Precaution in him to try, before he came to a Battel, whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> were diſpos'd to it? And it was equally neceſſary, in caſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſhould prove unſucceſsful, to free himſelf from the Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of being the occaſion of it. Therefore when they were now actually defeated, to repeat the ſame Words, was the readieſt way to put them in mind that he had propos'd the ſame Advice to them before the Battel; and to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unjuſt that their ill Fortune ſhould be charged upon him. See the 5<hi>th</hi> and 8<hi>th</hi> Notes on the ſecond Iliad.</p>

He asks, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What can be the Drift of <hi>Diomed,</hi> when he inſults <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in his Griefs and Diſtreſſes?

                        </q>This is the Introduction of a Man in Temper, who is willing to ſoften and Excuſe the Liberty of what is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and what Neceſſity only obliges him to utter. But he ſubjoins a Reſentment of the Reproach the King had formerly thrown upon him, and tells him that <hi>Jupiter</hi> had given him Power and Dominion without Courage and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Theſe are things which agree but ill together, that <hi>Diomed</hi> ſhould upbraid <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in his Adverſity with paſt Injuries, after he had endur'd his Reproaches with ſo much Moderation, and had reproved <hi>Sthenelus</hi> ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the contrary Practice in the fourth Book. If any one anſwer, that <hi>Diomed</hi> was warranted in this Freedom by the Bravery of his warlike Behaviour ſince that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, he ſuppoſes this Hero very ignorant how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean himſelf in Proſperity. The Truth is, this whole Accuſation of <hi>Diomed</hi>'s is only a Feint to ſerve the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> For being deſirous to perſuade the <hi>Greeks</hi> againſt their Departure, he effects that Deſign by this counterfeited Anger, and Licenſe of Speech: And ſeeming to reſent, that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſhould be capable of imagining the Army would return to <hi>Greece,</hi> he artificially makes uſe of theſe Reproaches to cover his Argument. This is farther confirm'd by what follows, when he bids <hi>Agamemnon</hi> return, if he pleaſes, and affirms that the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> will ſtay without him. Nay he carries the Matter ſo

Then after a long Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when he has turn'd himſelf ſeveral ways, as if he was ſporting in a new and uncommon Vein of Oratory, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes by ordering the Watch to their Stations, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to invite the Elders of the Army to a Supper, there, out of many Counſels, to chuſe the beſt.

is every where of a Piece: He begins to yield, and not to have done ſo, would not have ſpoke him a Man; to have made him perfectly inexorable had ſhewn him a Monſter. Thus the Poet draws the Heat of his Paſſion cooling by ſlow Degrees, which is very natural: To have done otherwiſe, had not been agreeable to <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Temper, nor the Reader's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, to whom it would have been ſhocking to have ſeen him paſſing from the greateſt Storm of Anger to a quiet Calmneſs. <hi>Euſtathius.</hi>

                     </q> It is very obſervable how this Hero riſes in the Eye and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the Reader as the Poem advances: It opens with many Circumſtances very much to the Diſadvantage of his Character; he inſults the Prieſt of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and outrages <hi>Achilles:</hi> but in the ſecond Book he grows ſenſible of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Raſhneſs, and takes the Fault entirely upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: In the fourth he ſhews himſelf a skilful Commander, by exhorting, reproving and performing all the Offices of a good General: In the eighth he is deeply touch'd by the Sufferings of his Army, and makes all the Peoples Calamities his own: In the ninth he endeavours to reconcile himſelf to <hi>Achilles,</hi> and condeſcends to be the Petitioner, becauſe it is for the publick Good: In the tenth, finding thoſe Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ineffectual, his Concern keeps him the whole Night awake, in contriving all poſſible Methods to aſſiſt them: And now in the eleventh as it were reſolving himſelf to ſupply the want of <hi>Achilles,</hi> he grows prodigiouſly in his Valour, and performs Wonders in his ſingle Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee <hi>Agamemnon</hi> continually winning upon our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, as we grow acquainted with him; ſo that he ſeems to be like that Goddeſs the Poet deſcribes, who was low at the firſt, but riſing by degrees, at laſt reaches the very Heavens.</p>

It is not improbable but that the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> many Ages after the Flood, were the firſt who divided the Day into Hours; they being the firſt who applied themſelves with any Succeſs to Aſtrology.

                  <p>It is reaſonable to think from the Frequency of their Wars, that the Profeſſion in thoſe Days was chiefly Chirurgical: <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays expreſſly that the <hi>Diaetetic</hi> was long after invented; but that <hi>Botany</hi> was in great Eſteem and Practice, appears from the Stories of <hi>Medea, Circe,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>This whole Paſſage is inimitably juſt and beautiful, we ſee <hi>Ajax</hi> drawn in the moſt bold and ſtrong Colours, and in a manner alive in the Deſcription.

                  <p>But Monſieur <hi>Dacier</hi> has done it very well in his Remarks upon <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In the time of <hi>Homer</hi> (ſays that Author) an Aſs was not in ſuch Circumſtances of Contempt as in ours: The Name of that Animal was not then converted into a Term of Reproach, but it was a Beaſt upon which Kings and Princes might be ſeen with Dignity. And it will not be very diſcreet to ridicule this Compariſon, which the holy Scripture has put into the Mouth of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who ſays in the Benediction of his Children, Iſſachar <hi>ſhall be as a ſtrong Aſs.</hi>
                     </q> Monſieur <hi>de la Motte</hi> gives up this Point, and excuſes <hi>Homer</hi> for his Choice of this Animal, but is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily diſguſted at the Circumſtance of the Boys, and the obſtinate Gluttony of the Aſs, which he ſays are Images too mean to repreſent the determin'd Valour of <hi>Ajax,</hi> and the Fury of his Enemies.

To judge rightly of Compariſons, we are not to examine if the Subject from whence they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd be great or little, noble or familiar; but we are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to conſider if the Image produc'd be clear and lively, if the Poet has the Skill to dignify it by poetical Words, and if it perfectly paints the thing it is intended to repreſent.

However, upon the whole, a Tranſlator owes ſo much to the Taſte of the Age in which he lives, as not to make too great a Complement to a former; and this induced me to omit the mention of the word <hi>Aſs</hi> in the Tranſlation.

The Reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that all the World are not capable to judge of the Juſtneſs and Force of a Thought; but there's ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man who cannot, eſpecially in a living Language, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the leaſt Meanneſs of Words.

He ſays indeed in his Book of ancient Medicine, that the Ancients were ignorant both of the good and bad Qualities of Wine: and yet the Potion here preſcrib'd will not be allow'd by Phyſicians to be an Inſtance that they were ſo; for Wine might be proper for <hi>Machaon</hi> not only as a Cordial, but as an <hi>Opiate. Aſclepiades,</hi> a Phyſician who flouriſh'd at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Time of <hi>Pompey,</hi> preſcribed Wine in Feavers, and even in Phrenzies to cauſe Sleep. <hi>Caelius Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relianus, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</p>

                     <q rend="inline">VERSE 801. <hi>Can then the Sons of</hi> Greece, &amp;c.]</q> It is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary with thoſe who tranſlate or comment on an Author, to uſe him as they do their Miſtreſs; they can ſee no Faults, or rather convert his very Faults into Beauties; but I cannot be ſo partial to <hi>Homer,</hi> as to imagine that this Speech of <hi>Neſtor</hi>'s is not greatly blameable for being too long: He crouds Incident upon Incident, and when he ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he expatiates upon his own great Actions, very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally indeed to old Age, but unſeaſonably in the preſent Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. When he comes to ſpeak of his killing the Son of <hi>Augeas,</hi> he is ſo pleas'd with himſelf, that he forgets the Diſtreſs of the Army, and cannot leave his favourite Subject till he has given us the Pedigree of his Relations, his Wife's Name, her Excellence, the Command he bore, and the Fury with which he aſſaulted him. Theſe and many other Circumſtances, as they have no viſible Alluſion to the Deſign of the Speech, ſeem to be unfortunately introduc'd. In ſhort, I think they are not ſo valuable upon any other Account, as becauſe they preſerve a Piece of ancient Hiſtory, which had otherwiſe been loſt.</p>
                  <p>What tends yet farther to make this Story ſeem abſurd, is what <hi>Patroclus</hi> ſaid at the beginning of the Speech, that he <hi>had not leiſure even to ſit down;</hi> ſo that <hi>Neſtor</hi> detains him in the Tent ſtanding, during the whole Narration.</p>
                  <p>They that are of the contrary Opinion obſerve, that there is a great deal of Art in ſome Branches of the Diſcourſe; that when <hi>Neſtor</hi> tells <hi>Patroclus</hi> how he had himſelf diſobey'd his Father's Commands for the ſake of his Country, he ſays it to make <hi>Achilles</hi> reflect that he diſobeys his Father by the contrary Behaviour: That what he did himſelf was to retaliate a ſmall Injury, but <hi>Achilles</hi> by fighting may ſave the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army. He mentions the Wound of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> at the very beginning, with an Intent to give <hi>Achilles</hi> a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and that he may know how much his greateſt Enemy has ſuffer'd by his Abſence. There are many other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought in the Defence of particular Parts; and it
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0356100103:214"/>
may not be from the Purpoſe to obſerve, that <hi>Neſtor</hi> might deſignedly protract the Speech, that <hi>Patroclus</hi> might himſelf behold the Diſtreſs of the Army: Thus every Moment he detain'd him, enforced his Arguments, by the growing Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Whether this was the Intention or not, it muſt be allowed that the Stay of <hi>Patroclus</hi> was very happy for the <hi>Greeks;</hi> for by this means he met <hi>Eurypylus</hi> wounded, who confirm'd him into a Certainty that their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were deſperate, without <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Aid.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Neſtor</hi>'s ſecond Story, it is much eaſier to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; it tends directly to the Matter in hand, and is told in ſuch a manner as to affect both <hi>Patroclus</hi> and <hi>Achilles;</hi> the Circumſtances are well adapted to the Perſon to whom they are ſpoken, and by repeating their Father's Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he as it were brings them in, ſeconding his Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions.</p>

This Conduct has an admirable Effect, not only as it gives an Air of Probability to the Relation, by allowing Leiſure to the Wrath of <hi>Achilles</hi> to cool and die away by degrees, (who is every where deſcrib'd as a Perſon of a ſtubborn Reſentment, and conſequently ought not to be eaſily reconcil'd) but alſo as it highly contributes to the Honour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which was to be fully ſatisfy'd, before he could relent.</p>

It has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd from hence that our Author flouriſh'd not long after the <hi>Trojan</hi> War; for had he lived at a greater Diſtance, there had been no occaſion to have Recourſe to ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means to deſtroy a Wall, which would have been loſt and worn away by Time alone. <hi>Homer</hi> (ſays <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the Queſtion might be ask'd, how it came to paſs that no Ruins remain'd of ſo great a Work? and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to give his Fiction the neareſt Reſemblance to Truth. Inundations and Earthquakes are ſufficient to aboliſh the ſtrongeſt Works of Man, ſo as not to leave the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains where they ſtood. But we are told this in a manner wonderfully noble and poetical: We ſee <hi>Apollo</hi> turning the Courſe of the Rivers againſt the Wall, <hi>Jupiter</hi> opening the Cataracts of Heaven, and <hi>Neptune</hi> rending the Foundations with his Trident: That is, the Sun exhales the Vapours, which deſcend in Rain from the Air or <hi>Aether,</hi> this Rain cauſes an Inundation, and that Inundation overturns the Wall. Thus the Poetry of <hi>Homer,</hi> like Magick, firſt raiſes a ſtupendous Object, and then immediately cauſes it to vaniſh.</p>
                  <p>What farther ſtrengthens the Opinion, that <hi>Homer</hi> was particularly careful to avoid the Objection which thoſe of his own Age might raiſe againſt the Probability of this Fiction, is, that the Verſes which contain this Account of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Wall ſeem to be added and interpolated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt writing of the Iliad, by <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf. I believe the Reader will incline to my Opinion, if he conſiders the manner in which they are introduced, both here, and in the ſeventh Book, where firſt this Wall is mention'd.
