            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DURING my reſidence on
the Continent, I was ſo
fortunate as to contract an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the preſent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0238500401:5"/>
Biſhop of M—o, who was for
many years ſuperior of the
Scots College at Seville. To
that amiable man I am indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the following letters;
which were diſcovered by him,
during his reſidence in Seville,
at the bottom of an old cheſt,
which ſtood in a deſerted
and traditionally haunted room
in the attic ſtory of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</p>
            <p>THE letters were tranſcribed
into a book that was bound in
vellum, and in good condition.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0238500401:6"/>
From the date of the Preface
which is prefixed to them, they
appear to have been <hi>collected</hi> at
the cloſe of the laſt century.
At what time they were <hi>written,</hi>
it is impoſ ſible now to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
though probably about
the year 1671, as about that
time the dukedom of Arandina
became extinct by the death
of Don John twentieth and laſt
Duke.</p>
            <p>THE author of the Preface
which is prefixed to theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſeems to have been well
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0238500401:7"/>
acquainted; with the hiſtory of
the houſe of Arandina; and it
is by no means improbable,
that Father Alberto, who makes
ſo important a figure through
the whole of the hiſtory, was
the perſon who thus preſerved
it.</p>
            <p>HAD theſe pages been the
production of a later period; I
ſhould have been led to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that the character of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto
had been copied from
that of the Biſhop of M—,
whoſe many amiable qualities,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0238500401:8"/>
and diſtinguiſhed talents, have
inſured to him the reſpect and
eſteem of all who are ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as to rank in the number
of his acquaintance. Nor can
I lay down my pen without
expreſſing the ſatisfaction with
which I embrace this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of teſtifying my reſpect
for that truly amiable man;
whoſe virtues would reflect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

PREFIXED TO THE
LETTERS,
BY THE
PERSON WHO COLLECTED THEM.</head>
            <p>DONNA Iſabella della Villarea
was the only fruit of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
marriage. Her father was
the younger brother of Don John,
twentieth and laſt Duke of Arandina,
and grandee of the firſt order. Don
Frederick, the father of Iſabella, at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0238500401:11"/>
an early period of his life, became
ſtrongly attached to Donna Eliza,
daughter of Don Carlos de Ulloa, a
grandee of the ſecond claſs.</p>
            <p>THE narrowneſs of Don Frederick's
fortune retarded for a long time his
union with Donna Eliza. At length,
wearied with the frequent diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he experienced, and not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any appearances in his favour,
he determined no longer to defer the
completion of his happineſs. He
had, indeed, repeatedly applied to
his brother for aſſiſtance; but the
only anſwer which he obtained from
the Duke was, that younger brothers
had better not marry. Don Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
now ſtated his caſe to Donna
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0238500401:12"/>
Eliza; who heroically preferred a
<hi>cottage</hi> with Don Frederick, to a
palace with the Duke of Caſtillo
Neuovo, who at that time paid his
addreſſes to her.</p>
            <p>DON FREDERICK was ſoon bleſſed
with the hand of Donna Eliza;
whilſt the family of Ulloa, incenſed
to the laſt degree at the ſtep ſhe had
taken, determined never more to ſee
her.</p>
            <p>MEANTIME, Frederick and Eliza
retired to a ſmall farm he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
in the province of Andaluſia;
where, for ſome months, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
a ſtate of uninterrupted
felicity; to which, however, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0238500401:13"/>
was at length put by the villany
of the Duke of Caſtillo Neuovo; for
one night, as Don Frederick was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home totally unattended,
the Duke, aided by a party of <hi>bravos,</hi>
attacked him. Don Frederick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himſelf with the utmoſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
and, after diſpatching the
Duke and two of the villains, ſunk,
covered with wounds, and expired.
The remainder of the party inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retired with the body of the
Duke, whilſt that of Don Frederick,
was ſoon after found by ſome pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
and carried home. The firſt
perſon who encountered the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
proceſſion was Donna Eliza.
The ſcene that enſued is too horrible
for deſcription. Suffice it to ſay,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0238500401:14"/>
that in a few hours Iſabella was
born, and her mother recovered
by ſlow degrees from that phrenſy
into which the death of Don Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
had driven her. Donna Eliza
continued in her retirement in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluſia,
where ſhe indulged her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
by ſpending great part of
each day at the monument which
ſhe had reared over the duſt of her
beloved Lord. In this manner had
five years elapſed, when Donna
Eliza found herſelf ſeized with a
fever, which ſhe was aſſured would
prove mortal. No ſooner did ſhe
receive the awful intelligence, than
ſhe addreſſed the following letter
to the Duke of Arandina, to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0238500401:15"/>
delivered by Iſabella after her
death.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

<hi>that</hi> whilſt you read this
letter; which will not be delivered
to you till the trembling hand that
writes, and the bleeding heart that
dictates, are no more.</p>
                  <p>I ACKNOWLEDGE, that by marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your too-amiable brother I inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him irreparably. I reduced
him to unmerited poverty; I depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him of your friendſhip and your
protection; and yet could only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
all theſe loſſes by beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0238500401:16"/>
on him my unworthy ſelf: A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
highly inadequate to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts;
but the unfortunate Eliza had
no other to conſer, and the too-generous
Don Frederick was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>GREAT as is the pleaſure with
which I behold my approaching diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
when I conſider that a few
hours will certainly reunite me to
my much-beloved. Frederick; yet
my pleaſure is far from unalloyed,
when I reflect that the only fruit
of our fatal ſhort-lived union, the
hapleſs Iſabella, whoſe misfortunes
were coeval with her birth, will (if
you withhold your protection) be
expoſed to innumerable dangers.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0238500401:17"/>
Have pity, then, on the helpleſs
orphan, who will deliver this to
your hands; and who, if you deſert
her, will be left to the wide world,
without one friendly hand to guide
her infant ſteps. Reflect, Don John,
on the ills to which the continuation
of your reſentment muſt expoſe her.
Do not puniſh Iſabella for the errors
of her unhappy parents. They have
drunk deep of the bitter cup of afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
do not oblige her to ſwallow
the dregs. By kindneſs to my Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,
you will atone for all the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
you have cauſed me. I,
with my dying breath, forgive you;
and righteous Heaven will alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
you, if you are a protector to
my dear inſant. A tremor, that now
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0238500401:18"/>
pervades my whole frame, obliges
me to conclude with once more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
you of the pardon, nay, of the
eſteem, of</p>

            <p>SCARCELY had Eliza finiſhed this
letter, when, claſping Iſabella in her
arms, ſhe ceaſed to ſigh, and ſought
her Frederick in the realms of bliſs.
No ſooner was Eliza entombed with
her Frederick, than Iſabella was ſent
to the Caſtle of Villarea, where Don
John then reſided. On her arrival,
ſhe delivered to him her mother's
letter, which he read with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
attention; and, after pauſing
upon it for ſome time, he ordered his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0238500401:19"/>
niece to be placed in the convent of
Ventina, where ſhe remained till the
age of ſixteen. The Duke then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to place her in his own
Caſtle: a determination with which
ſhe was by no means pleaſed; as,
from the ſpecimens which ſhe had
ſeen of her uncle's behaviour during
two or three ſhort viſits at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
ſhe had no great proſpect of
happineſs under his roof or in his
ſociety; Added to this, ſhe could
not bid an eternal adieu to thoſe
walls where ſhe had paſſed ſo many
happy hours, without feeling ſome
pangs, eſpecially as ſhe was then to
be for ever ſeparated from the friends
of her youth, of whom the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
was Donna Laura de
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0238500401:20"/>
Caſſildina. The parting of theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
was highly affecting to <hi>both,</hi>
but eſpecially to Donna Iſabella,
who looked with horror on a world,
which ſhe had been ever taught to
conſider as worſe than it really is.</p>
            <p>OF her reception at Villarea, a
full account is to be ſeen in her firſt
letter to Donna Laura, with whom
ſhe conſtantly correſponded, and to
whom ſhe communicated every event
that befel her during their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THUS, then, I have collected all
the facts relating to the life of Donna
Iſabella della Villarea; a woman di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
by every amiable quality;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0238500401:21"/>
in whom even the prying eye
of envy could not diſcover a flaw,
whilſt malice Itself paid her virtue
the tribute of ſilence.</p>

            <p>IN obedience to the ſacred injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

fail to inform her of every event, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0238500401:23"/>
dreary ſolitude: A ſolitude which
alone can be baniſhed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of her to whom I now write.
For her preſence, however, I have no
reaſon to hope; I am almoſt tempted

My uncle's behaviour could not fail
to render this place truly diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

as the happineſs of her ſociety muſt
always be to the wretched Iſabella,
it would ſuffer an alloy which in the

            <p>MY Laura will not be a little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
to hear what was the reception
I met with from the Duke on my
arrival. He received me at the gate,
ſurrounded by a numerous train of
domeſtics in rich dreſſes, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to me the fineſt people I had
ever ſeen; and though I have been
here ſome days, I cannot yet recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
myſelf to giving them my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>MY uncle's reception of me was
formal and polite. He told the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that they muſt henceforth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
me as their miſtreſs, and muſt.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0238500401:25"/>
pay an implicit obedience to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
He then introduced me to
his father-confeſſor, who reſides in
the houſe with him, and who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be about fifty, has a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
countenance, an air ſtrongly
tinctured with melancholy, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
highly poliſhed. From what I
have ſeen of him, I have reaſon to
hope he will prove an agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
A ſummons to attend the
Duke leaves me only time to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

            <p>TEN thouſand thanks for my
Laura's letter: it has ſcarce
ever been out of my hands ſince
its arrival. The affectionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
which you ſo kindly expreſs
for me, ſerves only to increaſe my
reget, when I reflect that I am for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0238500401:27"/>
ever baniſhed from ſo amiable a
friend. But, as you have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
it is our duty to ſubmit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repining, to the diſpenſations of
Providence, whoſe conduct to ſhort-ſighted
mortals ſeems ſometimes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
when it is directed to their
good, and when a different conduct
would involve them in misery. But
my buſineſs at preſent is not to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize,
but to deſcribe the Caſtle and,
its environs. The houſe is ancient,
and the building has an air of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
grandeur, well ſuited to my
diſpoſition. The orange groves that
ſurround it, and which are now in
full bloſſom, add greatly to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the place; and, would Heaven
grant me the preſence of my Laura,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0238500401:28"/>
I ſhould eſteem it a perfect paradiſe.
A poor compliment this to Villarea;
as earth contains not the ſpot, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
barren or however horrid, that
would not appear to me a paradiſe,
if that ſpot contained my Laura.</p>
            <p>THE peaſantry are poor and lazy;
but as my uncle's, allowance to me is
liberal, I can remedy the former,
though not the latter evil. Indeed
I greatly fear all attempts on that
head will prove ineffectual; as every
writer, who has mentioned the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry
of Spain, ſpeaks of them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent
in the extreme. The moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
peaſantry of whom I have
ever read any account, are thoſe of
England; though, having only ſeen
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0238500401:29"/>
them repreſented by writers of their
own country, I know not what cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
is to be given to the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>IN your letter, you expreſs a wiſh
to become more acquainted with my
uncle. Of him, however, I know
nothing more than at my firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
as he lives chieſty alone; and,
wherever he appears, preſerves ſo
much ſtate, as renders unſucceſsful
all attempts to become acquainted
with him.</p>
            <p>FATHER ALBERTO is a widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
character. His pleaſing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

you in every thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0238500401:30"/>
him. He is ſo good as to join
me in my walks, and exerts himſelf
on all occaſions to render my resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
here pleaſant. You would
like him much. If all men reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him, what a world would this
be! My Laura perhaps would then
quit the peaceful cloiſter, and adorn
ſome high ſtation in active life.—
But I muſt bid you adieu, as, the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

always leave room enough to admit
of my ſubſcribbing myself,</p>

He leaves me here to guard the Caſtle

            <p>YOU are, no doubt, my dear

I ſhall therefore proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

(ſaid he) having often led you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0238500401:40"/>
a wiſh that you were acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with my hiſtory, I will, without
reſerve, communicate to you all the
particulars of it with, which I myſelf
am acquainted.</p>
               <p>FORTY years ago, the maſter of
a Spaniſh merchantman being on a
voyage to England, whither he was
bound to diſpoſe of his cargo, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that one night there aroſe a
violent ſtorm. Juſt as it began, he
deſcried an Engliſh ſhip making ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of diſtreſs; but the violence of
the hurricane prevented him from
rendering her any aſſiſtance, and ſhe
periſhed in the ſtorm. The next
morning, the winds being now calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he diſcovered me, then not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0238500401:41"/>
above, a year old, floating
on a piece of the wreck. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
took me on board; and, ſome
ſigns of life appearing, all attempts
were made for my recovery; and
theſe at laſt proving ſucceſsful, my
preſerver, when all inquiries after
my original proved ineffectual, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me as his ſon. No fewer than
three Engliſh ſhips had periſhed in
that ſtorm; nor could he find any one
who knew that any of them had a
child on board. Thus was I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
for ever from diſcovering to
whom I owed my birth,—and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or not both my parents periſhed
in that fatal night;—fatal to <hi>me,</hi>
becauſe it deprived me of my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
protectors, and yet did not rob
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0238500401:42"/>
me of a life that has been perpetually
overcaſt with the gloomy clouds of
misfortune. But the ways of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
are unſearchable; and it is our
duty to ſubmit to its will without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining.
Nor have I any doubt but
that for wiſe and good reaſons my
life was preſerved from the mercileſs
waves. Under the roof of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
father (whoſe name I bear), the
firſt ſixteen years of my life were
paſſed in eaſe and tranquillity, when
the good man propoſed that I ſhould
accompany him on a voyage to Italy.
As was natural at my age, I embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with pleaſure an offer of ſeeing
foreign countries, and a few days
brought us in ſight of the Italian
coast. On our arrival at port, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0238500401:43"/>
on ſhore, that I might gratify
my curioſity, and make obſervations
on the inhabitants of a country which
had ſo often given lords to the world.
It happened, that one night as I was
walking alone on a retired part of
the beach, I heard the ſhrieks of ſome
perſon in diſtreſs, and they appeared
to be thoſe of a female. I followed
the ſound; and ſoon diſcovered two
ruffians dragging a moſt beautiful
woman towards a boat that waited
for them. I flew with the utmoſt
ſpeed to reſcue the diſtreſſed fair
one, and was happy enough to prove
ſucceſsful in the enterpriſe; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſpatched one of the villains,
the other made a precipitate retreat,
leaving me maſter of the field.</p>

            <p>"AFTER (continued he) the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains

for the ſervice which I had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0238500401:47"/>
on the moſt perfect form that I had
ever beheld, I requeſted permiſſion
to attend her home. To this ſhe
conſented; and we proceeded to a
very high wall, through which, by
an iron gate, we entered a moſt
beautiful garden. As we proceeded
toward the houſe, which terminated
the view, ſhe informed me that her
name was Eſtafania; that ſhe was
the only daughter of a conſiderable
merchant of the name of Altino, and
heireſs to all his fortunes. <q>To that
indeed (ſaid ſhe) I attribute the
calamity from which your valour
has reſcued me. The <hi>fame of my
wealth,</hi> rather than the <hi>luſtre of my

Amongſt them was Alcanzar, for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0238500401:48"/>
whom I conceived an inſuperable
averſion, which his ſubſequent
conduct has fully juſtified. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
much exaſperated at my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
and determined to carry
me off by force; in which attempt
he would have ſucceeded, had not
your ſword rid me for ever of
ſuch a dangerous enemy. The

me is ſuch as I never can repay.
I will, however, now introduce

"IN the ſaloon I was introduced to
the father and mother of Eſtafania;
who, on hearing the ſtory of her
eſcape, returned their moſt grateful
thanks to her deliverer. After re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
ſome time, I propoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the ſhip; and, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
permiſſion to make perſonal

was with difficulty permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
They aſſured me how happy I

received with every poſſible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0238500401:52"/>
them with the utmoſt frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

a ſhort ſketch of my memoirs. When
I concluded, they expreſſed their
hopes that fortune would now prove
propitious, and would ceaſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
me (here, however, they
were, alas! miſtaken.): They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
me with a ring of conſiderable
value; and deſired me, during my
reſidence there, to conſider their
houſe as my home: A requeſt with
which: I moſt readily complied, as
the charms; of Eſtafania had made
me her ſlave. For several weeks I
enjoyed the moſt exquiſite happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but it was too great to laſt. Our
buſineſs being concluded, we prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Eſtafania ſitting alone in the ſaloon.
As it was the laſt opportunity I

            <p>FROM this morning's walk I have
learned the reſt of Alberto's
tale.—"After (continued he) I
had taken leave of her father and
mother, I embarked for Spain, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0238500401:56"/>
a ſhort voyage landed us at Cadiz.
But, ah! how altered was I ſince I
ſailed thence! I had ſuſtained a loſs
we never can ſuffer but once. The
change it had effected was ſo ſtriking
as to be obſerved by every one who
ſaw me. I now played none but
plaintive airs, and ſeldom touched
my guitar without bedewing it with
my tears. I was become the victim
of melancholy; and the image of
Eſtafania was never abſent from my
mind. At night, when fancy was
permitted to rove unfettered by the
chains of reaſon, I was perpetually
wafted to thoſe ſcenes of former joys,
the ſhores of Italy, where indeed I
enjoyed a bliſs ſupreme, the ſociety of
my Eſtafania. But, alas! the bliſsful
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0238500401:57"/>
phantoms vaniſhed at the approach
of day, and each new ſun beheld my
griefs increaſe. In this manner near
a year had elapſed, when my kind
friend the ſhipmaſter informed me
that he was ſoon to reviſit Italy. You
will eaſily conceive with what readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
I embraced the propoſal, and
with what anxiety I embarked; but
when the ſhores of Italy appeared,
my anxiety became unutterable.
Sometimes my fancy repreſented
Eſtafania welcoming me with joy;

I reached the ſhore, before
my attention was arreſted by the
ſight of a marble monument, erected
beneath the ſhade of a large willow,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0238500401:60"/>
which ſeemed to weep over the urn
it ſhadowed. I approached with
prophetic horror, as if I had known
that it contained the aſhes of the too
amiable woman, in whoſe cauſe I
was once ſo happy as to draw a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
ſword. What did I not feel,
when, on a nearer approach, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
that it was inſcribed with
the name of ESTAFANIA! Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with horror at the ſight, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
motionleſs, till recalled to
myſelf by the approach of a man who
had long ſerved the family of her
whom I adored. From him I learned,
that ſome months had elapſed ſince
Heaven had claimed its own. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
which attacked my amiable
miſtreſs ſoon terminated her ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0238500401:61"/>
exiſtence, and ſnatched her
from the arms of two worthy and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
parents; who, unable to
behold without agony the ſcenes of
former bliſs, had removed to a diſtant
territory, leaving their manſion to
the care of ſervants; having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
never to reviſit ſcenes that
muſt neceſſarily call to remembrance
the virtues and the fate of an only
child, with whom periſhed all their
hopes of earthly happineſs.</p>
            <p>HAVING indulged my grief for
ſome time, I returned to the veſſel;
and, after paſſing a ſortnight in a

an aching heart bid a laſt adieu to

            <p>YESTERDAY, my Iſabella, I
pronounced the ſolemn vow,
by which I am bound to conſecrate
ſolely to religion the remainder of my
days. Many have conſidered this
ſeclusion from the world as an act
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0238500401:68"/>
highly meritorious, though to me it
appears in a light widely different.
By retiring from the world at the
early dawn of life, we in a manner
quit the ſtation aſſigned us by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
and, however we may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
ourſelves, can at best be deemed
but deſerters. Some there are, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
whoſe weak virtue is ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
to reſiſt the powerful attacks
it muſt daily experience from vice
and folly: theſe do wiſely to fly, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than, by a feeble and unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
reſiſtance, to increaſe the triumph
of a wicked world. Conſcious that
the small portion of virtue which I
poſſeſs would ſcarcely be ſufficient
to ſupport me in the hour of trial, I
have determined to ſhun a foe I am
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0238500401:69"/>
not able to encounter. I am, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
well aware with what appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
Heaven beholds the conduct
of thoſe who, though ſurrounded by
the ſtrongeſt temptations, and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by all the incitements of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
continue with unſhaken perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
to tread the paths of virtue,
and by their bright example reflect
honour on their nature and their
God. For an undertaking ſo ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Heaven has fully qualified my
Iſabella. Each noble, each heavenly
virtue, finds an aſylum in her breaſt,
where they all unite to direct her
thoughts and her actions. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of a life ſo employed will, no
doubt, be proportionally ſplendid.
That it may be long before you claim
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0238500401:70"/>

            <p>OH, my Laura! how can I paint
my preſent feelings? The
Duke being ſuddenly called from
home for a few days, I determined
to gratify an inclination I had long
felt, and to indulge my feelings by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0238500401:72"/>
viſiting the hallowed ſpot where the
honoured aſhes of my parents moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Accompanied by Alberto, I
ſet out for the village where my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
years were ſpent. At the cloſe
of day we reached the hamlet; and
having ſecured a lodging at the houſe
of the Curè, I repaired, with a throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
heart, to the tomb of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
A grove of cypreſs appeared.
I entered with cautious ſteps, as if I
feared to waken thoſe who ſlept. It
is a covered monument in the form
of an altar, compoſed of black and
white marble. I would have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but the ſcene was too much for
my weak spirits. I fainted in the
arms of Alberto and Marianne.
When their attention reſtored me, I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0238500401:73"/>
approached the tomb; and, by the
pale moon's uncertain light, read
the inſcription, which mentioned
their names, and the dates of their
reſpective deaths. O Heaven, Laura,
what were my feelings! I fell on my
knees,—I bedewed the hallowed
marble with my tears,—called on
each, dear departed ſhade;—then
turned to heaven my ſtreaming eyes,
and begged a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>IN vain Alberto tried to remove
me from the monument: for me it
bad reſiſtleſs attractions; and whilſt
memory is mine, ſhall be for ever
dear. At length I was perſuaded to
retire; but it was with the greateſt
difficulty I could ever prevail on my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0238500401:74"/>
to quit the awful ſcene. The
ſtream, that flowed with melancholy
murmurs through the grove, ſeemed
to reproach me for quitting the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
ſpot; but half the night was
ſpent, and Alberto feared a longer
ſtay might injure my health. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with his wiſh. On my arrival
at the Curè's, I inſtantly retired to
my apartment; and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the dejection of my ſpirits, I fell
aſleep. Fancy, fleeting fancy, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
me back to the tomb of Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric
and Eliza. It appeared to me,
after I had remained ſome time kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at their ſhrine, that the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
opened, and that I inſtantly
entered; the maſſive portals then
cloſed, and I waked to lament an
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0238500401:75"/>
exiſtence that is indeed painful. At
the firſt dawn of the day I reviſited
the grove; and, after ſhedding ſome

that my uncle condeſcended to

            <p>I CANNOT ſay I was very grateful

as, though it was not then
probable that we ſhould ever meet
till time ſhould have deſtroyed even

derogated from his dignity. The

He offered to inform you

            <p>OH, Laura, what a ſcene have
I juſt witneſſed! We went
to walk that we might enjoy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
evening. Scarcely had we
entered the grove that terminates
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0238500401:81"/>
the lawn, when we were alarmed by
the clashing of ſwords; and in a
moment my terror was increaſed to
the higheſt, at ſeeing a man with a
ſword in his hand, and covered with
blood, ſpring over the ſence. No
ſooner did I behold this horrid ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle,
than I ſunk into the arms of
the faithful Marianne. Meanwhile
the stranger who had thus alarmed
us requeſted our protection, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us that he had juſt eſcaped from
aſſaſſins, with whom he had long
maintained an unequal combat. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Alberto having aſſured him of
protection, directed all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
towards effecting my recovery,
in which he at length ſucceeded;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0238500401:82"/>
and the firſt object that I beheld was
the bleeding stranger kneeling at my
feet. A ſight ſo horrible, occaſioned
an inſtantaneous relapſe 3 and it was
with difficulty my wavering ſpirit
was ever recalled. How happy if it
then had ſought another world, and
united me to my dear, dear parents,
of whom I am for ever talking with
my good old nurſe. On my recovery,
I learned what I have juſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated

            <p>I AM juſt returned from a viſit to

We had an interview with
the unfortunate ſtranger, who is now
ſo much recovered from his wounds
as to ſit in the garden on a bench for
ſome hours every day. At our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0238500401:85"/>
he attempted to riſe; but
from loſs of blood was too feeble.
After recovering himſelf a little, and
returning his thanks in the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

 <q>I am the only ſon of Albino de
Caſtina a merchant in Cadiz, who
has a ſmall houſe in this neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
whither I was going when
attacked by the ruffians, from
whom you ſo kindly protected me.
They were hired to aſſaſſinate me
by a woman of conſiderable wealth,
who has done me the honour to
entertain ſentiments in my favour.
To theſe I made not a ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
which has ſo exaſperated her,
that ſhe determined on having a
bloody revenge. On that revenge
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0238500401:86"/>
I ſhall ever reflect with pleaſure,

refuſe him one five minutes interview,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0238500401:103"/>
he is ſo much hurt by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal.
However, he is gone; ſo I

granted the requeſt. I wiſh you had

            <p>OH, Laura, I am undone! I have
ſeen Alonzo. I went alone to walk
in the grove. I had not been long
there when Alonzo, ruſhing from

—liſtened to the moſt eloquent

            <p>OH, Laura! that fatal interview

he has written to me requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſuch reaſons as will, I hope, be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſufficient even by Alonzo. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heaven! to know Iſabella, is to
be unfortunate. I have not the
power of conferring happineſs on
any one. All I wiſh is to render no
one miſerable.</p>
            <p>INCLOSED you will receive his letter
and my reply. From that reply you
will learn, that he has made ſome
impreſſion on a heart, that was, that
muſt, be ever yours. O! that when
Providence determined to prolong
Alonzo's days, it had not choſen the
wretched Iſabella as its inſtrument.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0238500401:112"/>
I ſhould not then have known that he
exiſted. My years would, probably,
have elapſed, undiſturbed by thoſe
feelings which now diſtract my ſoul.
Grant, Heaven, I be not numbered

have fallen before its ſhrine! If ever

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0238500401:115"/>

Iſabella for whom you profeſs ſo

convince you, that by continuing to

you will only inflict miſery on her

in any degree, advancing your own

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0238500401:116"/>
your rank in life leaves you no room

uncle, one of the proudeſt grandees

            <p>YOu are not ignorant of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0238500401:119"/>
purſuit, as by that conduct, and
by that <hi>alone,</hi> ſhe ſays, I can ever
convince you that my gratitude is
laſting. Gratitude,—what a word is
that! If I am permitted to be only
grateful, the preſervation of my life
I muſt conſider as a misfortune; for
I love you, I adore you, and feel,
that without a return of love, I muſt
for ever be wretched. That I am
not worthy of ſuch a return, I am
more ſenſible than your friend can
be: but if you be determined to liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to no addreſſes but thoſe which
are worthy of you, to the exquiſite
happineſs reſulting from a mutual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
you muſt for ever remain
a ſtranger; for the man has not yet
been born, whoſe accompliſhments
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0238500401:120"/>
entitle him to the heart and hand of
Iſabella. That in me it is preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to pretend to either, I needed
not the information of Donna Laura
to convince me; but from her alone
have I learned, that my birth is the
great obſtacle in my way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Of the inferiority of my rank
in life to that of the Duke of Aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina
I am not ignorant; but can
Iſabella,—can the daughter of Donna
Eliza, put wealth, or titles, or a long
line of anceſtry, in the balance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the pureſt and moſt refined
attachment, that ever inhabited a
human breaſt? Your friend ſays
that you can,—that you deem my
addreſſes diſgraceful, and that they
inflict miſery upon you. If this be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0238500401:121"/>
indeed the caſe, I will ceaſe to urge
them. That I ſhould ever ceaſe to
love you, till I ceaſe to exiſt, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible;
but my love ſhall not be
your torment: may you be happy,
though I muſt be wretched. But,
ſurely, a mind angelic as yours can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
delight in the wretchedneſs of
others! And ſince your correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

much relief to my aching heart,
<hi>that,</hi> I hope, you will not refuſe, to

            <p>SOME time ago, as a young man
of the name of Caſtina was
travelling near the Caſtle of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,
being attacked by robbers, he
eſcaped (though not unhurt) into
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0238500401:134"/>
the groves of Villarea. There he
found your niece, who conducted
him to the gardener's lodge, where
he remained till healed of his wounds.
During his confinement, he was
conſtantly viſited by your niece
Donna Iſabella; who, the day of his
departure, favoured him with a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
interview—when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
the moſt ſolemn vows of
perpetual attachment. Theſe facts
I had from your gardener, who was
himſelf working in the grove at the
time. Now Don Alonzo is under
an engagement to marry me; and I
am ſure you would not wiſh your
niece ſhould wrong any woman, ſo
as to rob her of a contracted huſband.
I therefore hope you will forbid him
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0238500401:135"/>

            <p>AT the requeſt of your Iſabella,
I have taken up my pen, to
communicate to you every circumſtance
relating to her preſent misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Laſt night the Duke return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and retired to his apartment
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0238500401:144"/>
without any thing remarkable in his
conduct. But this morning he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
all the ſervants to attend him
in the great hall; when, producing
a letter from a woman of the name
of Gonzara (the woman who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
to procure the aſſaſſination of
Alonzo), he obliged the gardener to
read it aloud. It contained a full
account of Alonzo's rencounter with
Iſabella in the grove, as well as of
the parting ſcene which took place
in my abſence. This account, ſhe
ſaid, was communicated to her by
the gardener; who now threw himſelf
on his knees, and implored the
Duke's pardon for having concealed
the affair from his knowledge. No
ſooner was the Duke convinced that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0238500401:145"/>
his information was well founded,
than his appearance ceaſed to be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
The man was inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
for having concealed from the
Duke what, for a few dollars, he had
communicated to Gonzara. Poor
Iſabella, during this ſcene, had
ſwooned. Happily every attempt to
recover, her proved ineffectual; ſo
that ſhe was inſenſible of the abuſe
with which ſhe was loaded by the
Duke. I intreated the Duke to be
leſs violent; aſſuring him that I had
been the adviſer of Iſabella through
the whole of the affair, at leaſt as
far as related to receiving Alonzo
when wounded, and to procuring
a proper attendance to be paid to
him during his illneſs. Adding, at
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0238500401:146"/>
the ſame time, that illuſtrious as was
the houſe of Arandina, it muſt ever
receive additional luſtre from acts of
mercy and benevolence; and that no
ſtation, however exalted, could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
us from the duties which we
owe to our fellow-pilgrims in the
vale of tears. To this the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that I was the firſt perſon who
had ever propoſed to convert his
gardener's lodge into an infirmary
for all rogues who happened to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
on his eſtate; and that both his
niece and I were very much to blame
for the part we had acted. I ſaid,
Whatever might be the errors of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,
I was ſure they would, on
inquiry, prove to be thoſe of the
head, and not of the heart; and that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0238500401:147"/>
the former were very excuſable in
people of her age, and who, like her,
were totally unacquainted with the
cuſtoms of the world. He at length
became a little pacified, permitted
Iſabella to be removed, and poſtpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
any farther inquiry till to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;

love for you is, indeed, very great;
and ſhe is well worthy of that affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which we both entertain for her;
ſhe is certainly an angel in fleſh and
blood. Much as ſhe now ſuffers
from his treachery, ſhe has inſiſted
on my carrying the gardener thirty
dollars, that he and his family may
not ſuffer want an their diſmiſſion
from the Duke's ſervice: For, ſaid
ſhe, though he has greatly injured
me, and betrayed the truſt I repoſed

Thus does ſhe practice that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

duty ſo inculcated by the great

The original letters of Alonzo are,
ſhe ſays, in your posseſſion, as well as
her anſwers. Had Iſabella been
more verſed in the ways of the
world, ſhe would certainly not have
permitted Alonzo to Correſpond with
her. But how few are there whoſe
lives are marked with a ſingle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,
and that of no very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
nature!</p>
            <p>AT her requeſt, I communicated
her letters and thoſe of Alonzo to
the Duke, who raved like a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
He recounted all his anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
for thirty generations; called on
them to pour down vengeance on
the head of their diſgraceful deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
the amiable Iſabella; vowed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0238500401:153"/>
eternal vengeance to Alonzo, for
whom he ſent a meſſenger requiring
his immediate attendance. In vain
did I endeavour to place the conduct
of Iſabella in the moſt favourable
point of view; in vain did I obſerve
that ſhe diſcouraged all hopes in the
breaſt of Alonzo. He ſtill continued
to rave at Iſabella, till on the arrival
of Alonzo his fury took another
courſe. No ſooner did this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
youth appear, than he loaded
him with every poſſible inſult, and
at laſt ſtruck him. On this, Alonzo
drew his ſword, but happily was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
by the attendants. The Duke
now ordered his hands to be tied;
and producing his patent of creation,
read it aloud to Alonzo. In it were
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0238500401:154"/>
enumerated thirty titles of honour;
and amongſt others, the Earldom of
Joppa, Viſcount Mount Sinai, and
Baron Capernaum, granted to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor
by Godfrey de Boulogne King
of Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>He now aſked Alonzo, how the

than that of a lackey? Told
him, that, if ever he was found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

him an appointment in the mines;
and then diſmiſſed him. Alonzo
retired vowing vengeance; whilſt I
uſed all my art to diſſuade the Duke

let the tears of Iſabella avert the

            <p>MY preſent bliſs is too great to

Vengeance! no, by Heaven, he ſhall
experience none from me; he ſhall
live: but to you he is indebted for
the prolongation of his days—deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>ALL my apprehenſions for the
ſafety of the Duke being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
by the promiſe Alonzo has
given me not to take vengeance on
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0238500401:170"/>
him for his conduct at the Caſtle, I
ſhall now expreſs to my Laura the
fears I entertain concerning my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
happineſs. Oh, my Laura, how
little do we ſhort-ſighted mortals
know what will be conducive to our
happineſs! The time was when I
thought that no event (however
gloomy in its appearance) could be
deemed unfortunate, if it was the
occaſion of my returning to Ventina
and to you. But, ah! how chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
are all my ſentiments! How
often have I wearied Heaven with
prayers that I might return to Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina!
<hi>now</hi> the mention of thoſe walls
fills my mind with horror. Why
this wonderful change? Is Laura
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0238500401:171"/>
leſs beloved than before? No, <hi>that</hi>
is impoſſible.—Is Iſabella leſs ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
of virtue than ſhe once was?
She hopes not.—Is her heart a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to love? Ah, no! <hi>that</hi> is the ſad
truth—Alonzo is beloved. Within
Ventina's walls he never muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
yet Villarea is not more <hi>propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
to his wiſhes than Ventina. But
the ſolemn vow I ſo ſoon muſt make,
chills my blood with horror. Have
mercy on me, Heaven. Oh! How
my heart throbs! Adieu, dear Laura.
