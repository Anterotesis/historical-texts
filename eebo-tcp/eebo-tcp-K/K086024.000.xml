            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O inſiſt on the Value of Works of this Nature, when they come from Men of real Knowledge and Underſtanding, were only to repeat what the wiſeſt Men have often ſaid for us. The Reader, we believe, will be convinced that Sir <hi>John</hi> was a Perſon very equal to the Task he undertook; and having ſuch Opportunities of prying, as it were, into the Hearts of the greateſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Princes of his Time, it had been unpardonable in him to have refrained from communicating the many important Matters he ſo aſſuredly knew. The Reader, will,
<pb facs="tcp:0170800300:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we hope, find in him an Impartiality rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met with in Writers, who have been, like him, of a Party; for being a Man of the ſtricteſt Honour, and niceſt Conſcience, he it ſeems thought it as unjuſt not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud an Enemy for any good he had done, as weak not to accuſe a Friend when, through human Frailty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hapned to deſerve it. This, and what goes before, might be ſufficient to beſpeak the Reader in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, even tho' he had related no Fact but ſuch as had been an hundred Times repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before this Appearance of his Book; but as he abounds with Things new, or what is the ſame, with Matters known to very few living, and which will much aſſiſt us in forming a right Idea of the Times he lived in, he muſt claim a greater Share of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. But we will now leave Sir <hi>John</hi> to plead his own Cauſe, and ſhall only add, that we flatter our ſelves with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Public for our thus retrieving him from the Receſſes of Privacy.</p>

His Actions I leave to the Hiſtorian; and having been very near his Perſon but once, at an Audience of an Ambaſſador at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> I can only ſay that his Figure did not come up to his Character; he was indeed a likely Perſon, but not handſom, nor had he a very bold look with him. He
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0170800300:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 was plain in his Apparel, and rather negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent than not. Tears he had at will, and was doubtleſs, the deepeſt Diſſembler on Earth.</p>

This Duke was the fineſt Gentleman, both for Perſon and Wit, I think I ever ſaw; but he knew not how to be long ſerious, or mindful of Buſineſs; and had behaved with ſome Inſolence to the King, which was the Cauſe of their Separation. It was now that I firſt became acquainted with him, and he from the very firſt Moment expreſſed a Kindneſs for me.</p>
            <p>It was now eaſy to perceive that a way was paved to facilitate the King's Return; but ſtill the Rump kept up ſome Face of State; and I remember to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at a Dinner, given by the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to <hi>Lambert</hi> and other Officers of the Army, by far more coſtly and ſplendid, than any I ever ſaw given afterwards to his

            </p>
            <p>Continuing but in an indifferent State of Health, I, partly for that Reaſon, and partly for others, returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I had no ſooner put my ſelf into ſome Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, but I endeavoured to be known at our Queen Mother's Court, which ſhe then kept at the Palais Royal. Her Majeſty had none of her Children with her, but the Princeſs <hi>Henrietta Maria;</hi> and few of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> making their Court there, I was the better received. As I ſpoke the Language of the Country and danced pretty well, the young Princeſs, then about fifteen Years of Age, behaved towards me with all the civil Freedom that might be; ſhe made me dance with her, played on the Harpſicord to me in her Highneſs's Chamber; ſuffered me to wait on her as ſhe walked in the Garden, and ſometimes to toſs her in a Swing between two Trees, and, in fine, to be preſent at all her innocent Diverſions.</p>
            <p>The Queen commanded me to attend as often as I conveniently could; ſhe had a great affection for <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding the Severity of Uſage ſhe and hers had met with there. With the great Men and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0170800300:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 of <hi>France,</hi> ſhe diſcourſed much in Praiſe of the People and Country, of their Courage, their Generoſity, their good Nature, and would excuſe all the late Misfortunes, as brought about by ſome deſperate Enthuſiaſts, rather than proceeding from the Genius and Temper of the Nation. To give a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Inſtance of her Inclination for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> I hapned to carry an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with me one Day to Court, and he, to be very fine, had got him a Garniture of rich Ribbon to his Suit, in which was a Mixture of Red and Yellow; which the Queen obſerving, called to me, and bad me adviſe my Friend to mend his Fancy a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as to his Ribbons, the two Colours he had joined, being ridiculous in <hi>France,</hi> and might give the <hi>French</hi> Occaſion to laugh at him.</p>
            <p>I had three Couſins then in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Convent at <hi>Paris,</hi> one of them an antient Lady, and ſince Abbeſs of the Houſe: Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Queen was wont often to retire for ſome Days; and the Lady would tell me that Lord <hi>Jermyn,</hi> ſince St. <hi>Albans,</hi> had the Queen greatly in awe of him, and indeed it was obvious that he had great Intereſt with her Concerns; but that he was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, or had Children by her, as ſome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0170800300:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have reported, I did not then believe, tho <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1660</label> the Thing was certainly ſo.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>France</hi> was very ſplendid this Winter; a grand Mask was danced at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where the King and Princeſs <hi>Henriette</hi> of <hi>England</hi> danced to Admiration: But there was now a greater Reſort to the Palace than the <hi>French</hi> Court; the good Humour and Wit of our Queen Mother, and the Beauty of the Princeſs her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being more inviting than any thing that appeared in the <hi>French</hi> Queen, who was a <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen Mother received the News of his Majeſty's happy Reſtoration, with all imaginable Demonſtrations of Joy, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Things, gave a noble Ball at her Court, to which every Body of the greateſt Quality was invited. and to which all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, then at <hi>Paris,</hi> had Admittance. Having been ill ſome Time before, I would have been excuſed from Dancing, but the Queen commanded me to take out the Cardinal's Niece, I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>
            <p>I ſtayed at <hi>Paris</hi> till <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and received more Honours from the Queen and the Princeſs her Daughter than I deſerved, or could acknowledge, but by the moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0170800300:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 conſtant Duty and Attendance in my Power.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Aug. 2.</label> On the 2d Inſtant I ſat out for <hi>England;</hi> but before my Departure, I waited on the Queen for her Commands; ſhe told me ſhe would write by me, and ordered me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend next Morning for her Letter. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received it and taken my Leave, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know if it required Haſte? Her Majeſty ſaid, No, for that it contained but little beſides a particular Recommendation of me to her Son the King.</p>
            <p>At <hi>London</hi> I met my Mother and moſt of my Relations, who were come up, as from all Parts of <hi>England</hi> they did, to ſee the King, and was preſented by the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> then but Marquiſs, to his Majeſty in the privy Chamber at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering him the Queen's Letter, he asked me ſeveral Queſtions, both concerning her and my Voyage.</p>
            <p>The Court at <hi>Whitehall</hi> ſoon became very magnificent, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> having his Court apart, and the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> his: The Kingdom was now very rich, and Men were generally ſatisfied with the King's Return, tho' ſome Malecontents of ſeveral Sorts there were; and how ſhould it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? But the King did not much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0170800300:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Buſineſs: All was calm and eaſy,  he had a Parliament ready to yield to any Thing that was reaſonable, as the Acts they made ſufficiently declare, and the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> then Chancellor, was at the Helm. The King, who was at an Age and Vigor for it, purſued his Pleaſures; and if Love prevailed with him more than any other Paſſion, he had this for Excuſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that his Complection was of an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sort, the Women ſeemed to be the Aggreſſors; and I have ſince heard the King ſay That they would ſometimes offer themſelves to his Embraces: Nor were the two Dukes, his Brothers, more averſe to the Sex than his Majeſty.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Nov.</label> About this Time the King's Aunt (the Queen of <hi>Bohemia)</hi> came over from the <hi>Hague,</hi> as did alſo his Siſter, the Princeſs of <hi>Orange;</hi> but they both dyed ſoon after their Arrival: as did alſo the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen Mother often asked me if the King had done any thing for me, and what it was I had fixed my Mind on, that ſhe might ſpeak a Word for me; but in truth I did not at that Time purſue my own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as I might have done; and went to Court rather to converſe and look about me,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0170800300:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 than to ſollicit any Favour: I chiefly relied on the Queen's Kindneſs to me, and the Influence ſhe had over the King; but all the pleaſing Superſtructure fell to the Ground; the Queen left <hi>England</hi> ſoon after the Death of her Children, taking the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Henrietta</hi> away with her to <hi>Paris,</hi> and I was diſappointed.</p>

Having ſearch'd the Wood till Midnight, we came to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Houſe, where the People told us they had been deſiring ſome Victuals but a little while before, and that they could not be far off. Accordingly, about an Hour after this, we found ſome of them in the thickeſt Part of the Wood. They diſcharged their Pieces at us, but the Moon ſetting they got from us, and hurried back again to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0170800300:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where they met with the Fate every <label type="milestone">

Their Captain and about twenty more were hanged, drawn and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: About twenty of them were killed in their ſeveral Skirmiſhes, and about as many of the King's Men, one of which was ſhot not far from me in <hi>Cane-Wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was this Summer that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> firſt took any particular Notice of me. I hapned to be in Diſcourſe with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, and ſome other Gentlemen of his Nation, in the Preſence at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and the Duke joined us, he being a great Lover of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, and kind to thoſe who ſpoke it.

That a Bagpiper being exceſſively overcome  with Liquor, fell down in the Street and there lay aſleep.

            <p>The Parliament of theſe Days, had from the Beginning, which was ſoon after the Reſtoration, been perfectly well inclined to the King: They had given him a very great Revenue upon Tonnage and Poundage, as alſo by an Exciſe upon ſeveral Sorts of Liquors, Hearth-Money, not to mention Temporary Taxes, the whole amounting to above three times more than had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by any King of <hi>England</hi> before.

Exerciſe of his regal Office, without having  too great a Dependance on the People, a Cauſe which had been of ſuch pernicious Effects to his Royal Father.

His Grace in vain made Uſe of the Mediation of the Lord Treaſurer: And to ſay the Truth, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was not altogether ſo zealous for his Grace as he ought to have been, eſpecially if we conſider that it was to him he owed the White Staff he bore.

The King was at this time particularly <label type="milestone">

His Grace was alſo called to the Bar of the Houſe of Peers, for ſcandalouſly living with the Lady <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> as Man and Wife, he being a married Man, and for having killed my Lord <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> after he had debauch'd his Wife.</p>

            <p>The Time of the Meeting of Parliament now drawing on, I repaired to <hi>London,</hi> and petitioned the Committee of Privileges and Elections; and after all endeavours to the contrary, I was voted the Sitting Member, and conducted into the Houſe by Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> and Lord <hi>Cavendiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus received into the Houſe, I found the two Parties in great Extremes
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0170800300:29"/>
 againſt each other. The Court-ſide was very preſſing and urgent for Money for the King's preſent Occaſions; the Country Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thought of nothing leſs, except ſome Laws were enacted for the better Security of the Proteſtant Religion, and the grand Point of Property. But the two were ſo equal that nothing more than Words paſſed between them; meer Words without any Effect, for neither dared ſtand the Chance <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>May 15.</label> of a Queſtion put. In the midſt of this, Doctor <hi>Shirley</hi> prefers a Petition to the Houſe of Lords againſt Sir <hi>John Fag,</hi> a Member of the Lower Houſe, to appear and anſwer in a Cauſe he had brought before the Lords, and a Summons was ſent to Sir <hi>John,</hi> accordingly; which the Commons conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a Breach of Privilege, great Heats aroſe among them, and high Expreſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon this Occaſion, mutually vented againſt each other by both Houſes, the King thought fit to adjourn their Time of Sitting for the preſent.</p>

They would have had a ſhort Day, but it was my Buſineſs to get as long a one as I could, and I accordingly did ſo. In ſhort, the Buſineſs of the Houſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0170800300:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was of ſuch Conſequence, that the Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation  came on before our Cauſe could be heard. I took a particular Account of what was tranſacted this Seſſion, the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Particulars of which were ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily theſe.</p>
            <p>The King had in his Speech acquainted us, That he was four Millions in Debt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of what he owed to the Godſmiths or Bankers, a vaſt Sum more, for which he paid neither Principal nor Intereſt, to the Ruin of many Families. It being upon this put to the Vote whether Money ſhould be given or not, It was carried in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by four Voices, and that, when near four hundred Members were in the Houſe. But it appearing that both the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> exceeded us in the Proportion and Number of their Shipping, a Sum of Three Hundred Thouſand Pounds was voted to the King for the Building of twenty Ships, namely, One of the Firſt Rate, Five of the Second, and Fourteen of the Third.</p>
            <p>Several Ways were debated for the Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this Sum, as upon Land, upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> by Way of Poll, or upon <hi>French</hi> Commodities, and laſtly upon our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and upon Merchandiſe. At length it was to be levied upon Land, and paid in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0170800300:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 eighteen Months; to be lodged apart in the Exchequer, and appropriated to that particular Uſe, with very ſevere Penalties upon the Officers that ſhould apply it to any other: But the Sum itſelf, the time it was to be raiſed in, and other Circumſtances, were by no means grateful to the Court. It was farther voted That the Cuſtoms having been formerly given to the King for the Maintenance of the Fleet, a Clauſe to that effect and purpoſe ſhould be inſerted in this Bill, or a new one prepared to confirm it.</p>
            <p>The State of the Fleet was now given in, whereby it appeared that we had no more than eight Firſt Rates, nine Second Rates, and forty Three Third Rates; while the <hi>French</hi> exceeded us in the Number of theſe Rates by ſix and twenty, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> by fourteen.</p>
            <p>It was moreover voted that the Atheiſm, Debauchery, and Impiety of the preſent Age be inſerted, as Grievances to be redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: And it being violently ſuſpected that ſome Members of the Houſe did receive Gratuities from the Court to Vote on that ſide; it was put that a Committee ſhould be appointed to form a Kind of Oath or Teſt, to diſcover what Sums of Money and Offices had been given to Parliament Men to gain their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0170800300:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The <hi>French</hi> Trade alſo was complained of,  as being Thirteen Hundred Thouſand Pounds an overbalance for ours; and upon the Matter it appeared, that every Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds a Year had ſince the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paid a Hundred Pounds in Taxes to the Crown.</p>
            <p>It was alſo voted a Grievance, that Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the Peace ſhould be ſummoned to appear before the Council, to account for what they did in their judicial Capacity.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Novemb.</label> The Buſineſs alſo of <hi>Luzance</hi> took up ſome time in the Houſe. This <hi>Luzance</hi> was a <hi>French</hi> Jeſuit, but becoming a Convert to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> inveighed againſt the Fallacies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon he preached in the <hi>French</hi> Church in the <hi>Savoy.</hi> This alarmed the Papiſts, and particularly one Doctor <hi>Burnet,</hi> a Jeſuit, and Confeſſor to the Ducheſs of <hi>York,</hi> who finding him alone in his Chamber, and poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Three Men at the Door, threatned to murder him if he did not make Satisfaction for the Injury, eat his Words, and ſpeedily return to <hi>France.</hi> The Man in this deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Dilemma promiſed faithfully what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was required of him, 'till he got his Liberty, when preſently going to Doctor <hi>Breval,</hi> a converted Jeſuit as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0170800300:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 he told him the whole Story; <hi>Breval</hi> the next Day acquainted me with it, and I communicated it to the Houſe. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons took Fire at this, and ſtrait appointed a Committee to examine into the Matter, and ordered me to produce <hi>Luzance</hi> the next Day. He appeared accordingly, and averred the Thing for a Truth. This was the firſt time I preſumed to ſpeak in that great Aſſembly, or in any Committee; but the next Day I was obliged to do it ſeveral times in what concerned this violent Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Upon the Report made from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to the Houſe, my Lord <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me up to give an Account of ſome other things I had had from <hi>Luzance.</hi> One was that Two <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, being Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of great Subſtance and Credit, had been threatned by certain Papiſts, that if they were not leſs ſevere upon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, they ſhould ere long ſee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Blood flow in <hi>London</hi> Streets. A Committee was appointed to enquire into the Truth of this Matter; and <hi>Luzance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſummoned, gave Evidence to the very ſelf ſame Effect, and gave it under his own Hand. The Parties he had his Information from being ſent for, appeared alſo, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0170800300:34"/>
ſuch Threats to have been uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards  them by ſome <hi>French</hi> Papiſts; but, to what Cauſe it was owing is uncertain, they gave in only ſuch Names as were of Perſons either abſent, or of no Eſtimation; ſo that little came of this Buſineſs. But theſe and other ſuch Informations, concerning the Height and Inſolence of the Papiſts, did ſo exaſperate the Houſe, that many Motions were made to humble them. Some were for a ſpeedy Confinement of them to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, others for Baniſhment, and ſome again for diſarming them, and the like.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time after, the Matter of Doctor <hi>Shirley</hi>'s Petition to the Lords againſt Sir <hi>John Fag,</hi> was again renewed, tho' it had broke up the Parliament the laſt time. There were thoſe who thought the King had conſented to it, diſliking the warm Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of both Houſes: While others were of Opinion that the Lords of the Country Intereſt had perſuaded the Doctor thereto, with a View thereby to kindle ſuch a Flame between the two Houſes, that the King ſhould be obliged either to prorogue, adjourn, or diſſolve them: The ſaid Lords apprehending that if this Parliament ſhould ſit much longer, the Majority might be gained over by Money and Places, ſo as to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0170800300:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 become quite obſequious to the Court; and this My Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> (then in the Intereſt of Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> his Uncle, who was upon ill Terms with the Court, being no longer Lord Chancellor) told me was his Opinion.</p>
            <p>But whatever the Cauſe was, the Effect was ſuch That the Commons refuſing to let their Member plead at the Bar of the Lords during a Time of Privilege, it was reſolved That the Lords by receiving an Appeal from any Court, either of Law or Equity, againſt a Member of the Lower Houſe, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Seſſion of Parliament, were thereby Infringers of the Privileges of the Commons of <hi>England;</hi> and that ſuch Lawyers as ſhould attend as Counſel to plead in any ſuch Cauſe at the Lords Bar, ſhould be deemed as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the Rights of the Commons of <hi>England;</hi> and that the ſaid Vote be affixed to the Door of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and the Inns of Court; which was accordingly done: And the ſame Day it was voted by the Lords, that the ſame was Illegal and Unparliamentary, and tended to the Diſſolution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: And upon the whole, that they would not recede from their Right of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature by Appeals from the Courts of Equity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0170800300:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It was then put to the Queſtion, If the  King ſhould not be petitioned to diſſolve this Parliament, and it was carried in the Negative by no more than Two Votes.</p>
            <p>This Miſunderſtanding between the Houſes was very diſſatisfactory to the King. The Lords who had voted for the Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Parliament, entered their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the Journal of their Houſe, together with their Reaſons ſor ſo doing; ſo that Things being at this Paſs, the only Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient left, was to diſmiſs the Parliament, which the King did, by Prorogation to the 10th of <hi>February</hi> next.</p>
            <p>Before I left <hi>London,</hi> I, at the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of my Lord <hi>Ogle,</hi> went with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to ſee the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> being well aſſured that I ſhould be kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>I had a fine Black of about Sixteen Years <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1676</label> of Age, preſented to me by a Gentleman who brought him over from <hi>Barbadoes:</hi> This Black lived with me ſome Years, and died about this time of an Impoſthume in his Head. Six Weeks after he was buried, I <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Octob. 20.</label> received an Account That at <hi>London</hi> it was credibly reported I had cauſed him to be Gelt, and that the Operation had killed him. I laughed at it at firſt, conſcious it was a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0170800300:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Falſehood, and a ridiculous Story, 'till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further informed that it came from the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and his Family, with whom I had had ſome Differences at Law, and that he had waited upon the King to beg my Eſtate, if it became a Forfeiture by this Felony; I thought it convenient to ſend for the Coroner to view the Body with a Jury, before it was too far decayed, that a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs of the Part might not be imputed to Inciſion. The Coroner accordingly ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons a Jury, and does his Office; but when they came to uncover the Breaſt, it was ſo putrified they would go no further; ſo that upon the Examination of Eleven Witneſſes, ſome that laid him out, and ſome that ſaw him naked, ſeveral, becauſe of his Colour, having a Curioſity to ſee him after he was dead, they gave their Verdict, that he died <hi>Ex Viſitatione Dei,</hi> by the Hand of God.</p>
            <p>This however, was not thought ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for within a few Days after, there came one <hi>Bright,</hi> a Lawyer, one <hi>Chappel,</hi> an Attorney, (both concerned in the Duke's Affairs,) and one <hi>Buck,</hi> a Surgeon of <hi>Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> whom I had cauſed to be proſecuted not long before for having two Wives, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome others, with my Lord Chief Juſtice's Warrant, directed to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0170800300:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Coroner to take up the Body; which the  Coroner refuſed to obey, ſaying He had done his Office already. Theſe Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, however, took up the Body, and <hi>Buck,</hi> under Pretence of viewing the Part the better, would have taken it up with a Penkniſe, but it was not ſuffered, leſt by that Inſtrument he ſhould give the Wound he ſought for: But what was not only a Mercy, but a Miracle alſo, the Part proved to be perfectly ſound and entire, tho' the Body had been ſo long under Ground, and the reſt of it was much putrified and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that Shame of Face and Confuſion came pretty plentifully upon the Actors in this extraordinary Scene.</p>
            <p>A black and moſt ridiculous Piece of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice this; for had their Suggeſtion been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Fact, all their Art could never have ſo fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, as to have indangered either my Perſon or Eſtate. My Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Rainsford</hi> acted irregularly and illegally in this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Information not being given in to him upon Oath. And indeed he afterwards confeſſed he was miſled into it, and that the Duke's Solicitor was moſt preſſing and urgent with him, to grant the Warrant. The Duke of <hi>York</hi> told my Brother, He wondered ſuch a ſtir was made about a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0170800300:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 which muſt certainly be a flat Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: And Lord <hi>Ogle</hi> acquainted me, as did alſo my Lord Treaſurer himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, That he, meaning the Treaſurer, had taken great Pains to prevent the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of my Eſtate; and I believed it to be true, but ſhrewdly doubt it was with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, had it proved a Forfeiture, to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it for himſelf; I was told as much afterwards. I endeavoured however to reach the Bottom of his Plot, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure myſelf ſome Reparation, as may be obſerved hereafter.</p>

I waited on him therefore, and found him very open in his Diſcourſe upon ſeveral Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but for the moſt Part lamenting That his Countrymen would not allow him an Opportunity to be of Service to them with the King, and making many Proteſtations That the Jealouſies of thoſe who called themſelves of the Country Party, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely groundleſs and without Foundation: That to his certain knowledge, the King meant no other than to preſerve the Religion and Government by Law eſtabliſhed; and, upon the whole, wiſhed that neither himſelf
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0170800300:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or his Poſterity might proſper, if he did not  ſpeak what he really believed: That if the Government was in any Danger, it was moſt from thoſe who pretended ſuch a mighty Zeal for it; but who under that Pretence were endeavouring to create ſuch Diſcontents between the King and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as might produce Confuſion in the End; And intreated me to be careful how I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked myſelf with that Sort of People. My reply was, That I hoped I was not one to be wilfully miſled; that I ſhould have no Rule to go by in that Houſe but my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience, and that ſo I could be of no particular Faction or Party: That as much as I yet underſtood of the Duty of a Member of the Houſe of Commons at this Time, ſuggeſted to me a Moderation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Extremes, and to have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Regard for the Prerogative of the King and the Liberty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>True it is, till now that the Treaſurer uſed ſuch ſolemn Aſſeverations, with regard to the King's good Intention, and pretty clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced me that ſome of the Chiefs of the Country Party had moſt at Heart their own private Intereſt, whatever they aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Favour and Defence of the Public, I

            <p>The Condeſcenſion of the King, in giving this Satisfaction to ſo mean a Perſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me very much of the Truth of what he ſaid; as did alſo his natural Temper and Conſtitution; for he was not an active, buſy, or ambitious Prince, but perfectly a Friend to Eaſe, and fond of Pleaſure; he ſeemed to be chiefly deſirous of Peace and Quiet for his own Time.</p>

            <p>My Anſwer to this Meſſage was, That I was ſurpriſed at the Compliment from a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to whom I intended none, what I had ſaid having been with a due Regard to Truth: That however I was not ſorry I had happened to oblige his Lordſhip by it; and that ſince he had denied all concern in the iniquitous Affair of my dead Servant, I would prevent his Lordſhip, and wait on him my ſelf; as I did two or three Days afterwards. He received me with all the Civility and Kindneſs imaginable, and wiſhed that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf or Proſperity might proſper, if he was any way aiding or aſſiſting in the Plot laid againſt me. I told his Lordſhip, that I could not but add Faith to his Words; but that if he was not, I was well aſſured his Servants were; and therefore deſired he would give me leave to uſe my beſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to find it out: With all his Heart he ſaid, he did not only conſent to it, but would moreover aſſiſt me in the Inquiry; and ſo, with all poſſible Demonſtrations of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip we parted.</p>

 fair of my Election. which being to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſoon, his Majefty gave Orders to his Servants that were of the Houſe, to attend the Committee, and aſſiſt me with their beſt Services when it came on. The ſame Day the Duke of <hi>Albemark</hi> came down to engage his Friends to be for me, nor did the Duke of <hi>York</hi> forget to concern himſelf very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in my Behalf.</p>
            <p>The ſame Day being alone with the Lord Treaſurer, in his Coach as he was going to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> I told him that ſome of the Diſcontented had reſolved to haſten the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Bill as faſt as might be, that ſo the Houſe might riſe before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Bills, that were preparing, be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed; hoping thereby to incenſe the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bring about Cauſe of Complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, <hi>as if he called the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together for nothing but to get Money from them.</hi> His Lordſhip anſwered, That the King, well aware of the Deſign, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it by a Meſſage, that Day to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Houſe by Mr. Secretary <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> to this Effect, That if ought remained undone, which the Houſe judged neceſſary to be done for the good of the Nation, the King would allow them a ſufficient Time after <hi>Eafter,</hi> and that when they were ready,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0170800300:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
His Majeſty would paſs their Bills; a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage  that was accordingly delivered.</p>
            <p>My Lord Treaſurer ſent for me among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, deſiring us to aſſiſt what we could, towards the Reconciliation of a Difference likely to take place between the two Houſes, about framing the Bill for the ſix hundred thouſand Pounds, to be given to the King, which might endanger the Loſs of the ſame: For the Commons had made a Clauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, injoining the Officers of the Exchequer to give them an Account of the Disburſment and Diſtribution of the ſaid Sum; while the Lords had aſſerted they ſhould be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to both Houſes. This the Commons would not ſuffer, alledging the Lords could neither add to nor take away from a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Bill; for that as it was peculiar to them only to give Money, it was to them only that Account was to be given how it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. The Lords to this replied, That to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them the Power of calling the Officers of the Exchequer to a Reckoning, was to abridge them of the Privilege of Judicature they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly had as the ſupreme Court; and by way of Precedent obſerved, That when the Convention gave Money for the Disbanding of the Army, an Account of the ſame was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be laid before their Houſe as well
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0170800300:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 as the other. They both adhered tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to their Point, till the King at length prevailed with the Lords to eraſe their Clauſe; and ſo the Commons got the better of the Day.</p>
            <p>It was not long before this, That the King of <hi>France,</hi> having obtained a Victory over the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> did in his Return by <hi>Calais</hi> ſend over the Duke of <hi>Crequy,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> to pay a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to our King, who returned it by my Lord <hi>Sunderland.</hi> This gave juſt Cauſe to think there would be no War between the two Kings, contrary to what the Parliament had ſo earneſtly adviſed. I ſaw a Copy of the Letter theſe Ambaſſadors brought with them; beginning with this Stile or Title, <hi>Tres haut, tres Excellent &amp; tres Puiſſent Prince, tres cher tres aimé bon Frére Couſin &amp; Allié:</hi> And in truth our King's Neutrality deſerved all this from <hi>France,</hi> and much more.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>May 12.</label> Not long after, having the Opportunity of a private Converſation with the Treaſurer, I complained to him of the Injuſtice done me in the fooliſh Story of my Black's Caſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as alſo of the King's readineſs to grant away my Eſtate. He ſaid he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the King had given it, for that he had begged of him not to be too haſty in that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0170800300:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
particular, believing the Report to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious  Lye: But that he was of Opinion with me, that now was a fit Time to ask his Majeſty for ſomething by way of Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that he would aſſiſt me therein. His Lordſhip was upon this Occaſion ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen with me as to tell me, That tho' the King denied ſcarce any thing to the Duke, his Brother, he certainly did not love him at his Heart.</p>
            <p>He told me alſo That the King had no mind to fall out with <hi>France;</hi> and that if the Parliament would effectually engage him in that War, their Way would be to furniſh him with Sums of Money to prepare for it, and that no leſs than ſix hundred thouſand Pounds would be abſolutely neceſſary for that Purpoſe. That if the King accepted of this, he would be obliged to carry on the War; but that if the Parliament would not truſt him, he was in the right not to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark himſelf, and might juſtly argue, <hi>How can I depend on my Parliament to furniſh me with regular and equal Supplies to carry on a War, which they will not ſo much as enable me to prepare for?</hi> But I eaſily ſaw through this; I plainly perceived it was all Artifice to get the fingering of Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0170800300:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 He moreover ſaid, That the King could not in Honour join the Confederates againſt <hi>France:</hi> That in all the Treaties the King of <hi>England</hi> had been mentioned as Principal in the War: That in the Beginning he did actually join with <hi>France,</hi> and that for him now to turn his Arms againſt that Crown, would look neither juſt nor honourable in the Eye of the World. This his Lordſhip told me was the King's own Way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whenever War hapned to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Diſcourſe together; but that his Anſwer to his Majeſty was, That he needed not be ſo regardful of that Tranſaction, the <hi>French</hi> King having plaid him the very ſame Trick when Chancellor <hi>Hyde</hi> was chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. To this he replied, That the <hi>French</hi> King had a Pique againſt the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor: To which the Treaſurer ſubjoined, That whatever was the Cauſe, the thing was as he had ſaid.</p>
            <p>He was ſo free alſo as to tell me ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That the Duke was the Grand Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and that he now made his Court to the Sectaries and Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, only to give Strength and Vigour to the Popiſh Intereſt: That his Highneſs was ſo very a Bigot, that tho' the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims</hi> made no Scruple to go into our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0170800300:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Churches, and even kneel down during the  Time of divine Service, the Duke at the ſame time could not be prevailed on ſo much as to ſtep within the Doors. He obſerved that the Duke was particularly unhappy in his Servants, a ſenſeleſs Pack; but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Confeſſor was a notable Man, and one that had a great Influence over him; being as well as his Maſter averſe to a War with <hi>France.</hi> His Lordſhip however declared himſelf for it.</p>
            <p>The next Day I went to viſit the Duke and Dutcheſs of <hi>Lautherdale,</hi> at their fine Houſe at <hi>Ham.</hi> After Dinner, her Grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained me in her Chamber with much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon Affairs of State. She had been a beautiful Woman, the ſuppoſed Miſtreſs of <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and at that time a Lady of great Parts. Both her Grace and the Duke her Husband, were entirely in the Treaſurer's Intereſt. Her chief Complaint was, That the Duke ſo adhered to Papiſts and Fanaticks, and ſo put the King upon changing the Deputies of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all purely for the Subſervience of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Intereſt; and in ſhort, let me into the Secret of many Things I had never ſo much as heard of before; and particularly acquainted me with the State and Bent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0170800300:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 as her Husband was Lord Commiſſioner, ſhe was well able to do.</p>
            <p>The Day after I went to ask Mr. Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Williamſon,</hi> if any Entry had been made in his Office concerning my Eſtate? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered He durſt only own it to me in private, but that upon ſome Rumour of a Forfeiture, by ſome Act of mine, it was true that Mr. <hi>Felton,</hi> of the Bedchamber, had begged it of the King, and entered a <hi>Caveat</hi> thereof at his Office.</p>
            <p>Upon this I prevailed with my Lord Treaſurer to go with me to the King, of whom I begged two Things, namely, That he would be pleaſed to order Mr. Secretary <hi>Williamſon</hi> to eraze a <hi>Caveat</hi> that had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with him, upon his Majeſty's granting away my Eſtate to Mr. <hi>Felton,</hi> reputed to be forfeited by my pretended felonious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices with the Blackamoor that died in my Service: And that alſo he would be pleaſed to lay his Commands upon my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Rainsford,</hi> to diſcover to me at whoſe Sollicitation, or upon what Suggeſtion it was his Lordſhip iſſued out his Warrant to the Coroner to take up the Body after it had been ſo long interred.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Firſt</hi> the King anſwered, he did not remember any Grant he had made of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0170800300:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my Eſtate to any Perſon whatſoever, but  that if any ſuch <hi>Caveat</hi> was entered, he would ſee that it was expunged. As for the <hi>Second,</hi> He directed my Lord Treaſurer to ſend one with me to my Lord Chief Juſtice, as from him, to do as I had deſired; which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did the next Day by his Secretary. When we came to him, he told us the whole Matter, and begged I would excuſe him for having been ſo very forward in that Affair; and indeed he had good Reaſon ſo to do, having done more than he could juſtify; for he had granted his Warrant upon a bare Suggeſtion, that the Moor had dyed by ſuch an Act, without taking any Information ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Writing or upon Oath.</p>

The Commons did not approve of this, and voted that no Money ſhould be raiſed, till the King had firſt entered into a League Offenſive and Defenſive with <hi>Holland,</hi> and the reſt of the United Provinces, for the Safety of theſe Kingdoms, and the Recovery of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to abate the Power of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>

 In anſwer to this, the King ſaid, They <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>May 28.</label> had exceeded the Bounds and Methods of Parliament, That they entrenched on his Prerogative, by not only directing him to make Alliances, but by pointing out to him what thoſe Alliances ſhould be, and with whom to be made. That the Power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace or War reſided wholly in himſelf, and that if they took that from him, he ſhould have nothing left but the empty Name of King, and no more, and that in ſuch caſe, no Prince or State would enter into Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with him. Upon the whole, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Addreſs, but would uſe ſuch Means as became him for the Preſervation of his Kingdoms; adjourning them to the 16th Day of <hi>July</hi> following.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, having heard that my Lord <hi>Yarmouth</hi> was one that had begged my Eſtate, upon the Occaſion oſ the Death of my Black, and underſtanding that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was come to Town, I preſently waited on him at his Houſe, and being with ſome Difficulty admitted (for I had never ſeen him) asked him if the Thing was true? Whereupon he bitterly ſwore he never asked it from the King, and that he never knew any thing of it, farther than that one <hi>Wright,</hi> Sollicitor to the Lord <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> did
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0170800300:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
come and acquaint him That there was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly  to be ſuch a Forfeiture, and adviſed him to uſe his Intereſt with the King for it; but that he abſolutely gave no Ear to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſaying, <hi>He would never be the richer for the Misfortunes of others:</hi> That he believed it was pure Malice againſt me, and that he would ſerve me all he could to find out the Authors of it. In ſhort, I got it from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand, That he was neither directly or indirectly concerned in begging my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
            <p>The very ſame Day I found out Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> and threatned to bring my Action of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal againſt him, upon the Information I had received from my Lord <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> if he did not let me into the whole Intrigue. He then ingenuouſly confeſſed, That both <hi>Bright</hi> and <hi>Chappel</hi> beforementioned, had given him an Account of the Moor's Death, with all the Circumſtances of his pretended Caſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with all Aſſurance of the Truth of what they ſaid; and that he telling the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Lord <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> his Lordſhip ſent him to Lord <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> adviſing him to beg my Eſtate of the King, and that he begged it accordingly. I was now much ſurpriſed that two Noblemen ſhould make their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſo cheap, and deny a real Fact with

 ſuch Oaths and Aſſeverations; but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my ſelf that to make more Stir in the Thing, would be only to make a great deal of Noiſe about a very fooliſh Story, I contented my ſelf with this Satisfaction, that as a Sign of their Shame and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they had both given themſelves the Lye.</p>

            <p>It was, at this Time, generally believed that Peace was concluded between us, the Confederates, and the King of <hi>France.</hi> We blamed the States for their ready Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the States blamed the <hi>Spaniard</hi> who was full of his Offers, while he had neither Men, Arms, or Money in <hi>Flanders</hi> to defend it; and they both fell upon the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> who when they ſhould have given Money; and made other Preparations for the War, were waſting their Time in quarrelling at home with the Government, and with each other.</p>
            <p>The Parliament met, purſuant to adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the King ſpoke to them a little <label type="milestone">

This Peace with <hi>France,</hi> when there was like to be ſo ſtrong a Union combined to reduce that proud and potent King to a better Senſe of himſelf, was very ungrateful News to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and therefore the King, to throw the Blame of it upon the Commons, told us, in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0170800300:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 his Speech, it was owing to their Refuſal of Money, till ſomething was done for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their Religion; their Negligence to direct or adviſe him concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended War, or to aſſiſt him till he had changed Councellors, and conſequently the little Hopes the Confederates could have of Help from him; that this, together with the low Condition of <hi>Spain,</hi> had prompted them to lend an Ear to the Offers of Peace; not to ſpeak of the ſluggiſh Motion of the <hi>Germans,</hi> the Difficulty of getting them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, their Princes being influenced by ſuch diſcordant Views and Intereſts, and the preſent Poverty of the States General, all which had contributed towards the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the War.</p>
            <p>But ſtill our King was chiefly condemned in this great Affair, as he ſo long deferred to engage in this Alliance; which, had he ſooner done, the <hi>French</hi> King had never dared to perſiſt in the War; at leaſt he could not have made ſo great a Progreſs in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or have been able to make ſo good a Market for himſelf, as he did by this Peace.</p>

It was now ſaid the Duke had been perſuaded (but unjuſtly) that his Lordſhip endeavoured to inſinuate into the King, that there was ſomething of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in the Accuſation againſt the Queen, purely that he might hearken to a Divorce, and marry another more likely to bring Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the Crown.</p>
            <p>The Commons were now intent upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the Army, raiſing of Money for that Purpoſe, and the Conviction of Popiſh Recuſants; during which the Right of the Lords to interfere in a Money-Bill was

 warmly conteſted; but not to dwell on ſo <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Decem. 6.</label> nice a Subject, the King cauſed Mr. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi>'s Papers to be ſeized, and acquainted the Houſe of Commons, That having been his Ambaſſador at the <hi>French</hi> Court, he had taken on him to treat with the Pope's Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, without any Commiſſion from him for ſo doing; and that he had ſeized his Papers to come at the Purport of the ſaid Treaty. But <hi>Montague</hi> aſſured the Houſe, that this was a mere Artifice, a Contrivance of the Treaſurer's to ſave himſelf; but that his Lordſhip had therein failed, for that altho' moſt of his Letters were ſeized, he had by good Look ſaved the moſt material. One of them, dated the 25th of <hi>March</hi> 1678, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him to acquaint that Court with the great Difficulties he met withal here in the Affair of Peace between us and them, and the Fear there was the Parliament ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it: That however he had Orders from the King to bid him treat with them for a Peace, as well between them and the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, as our ſelves; upon Condition, the <hi>French</hi> King would give ours ſix hundred thouſand Livers <hi>per Annum,</hi> for three Years together, after the Concluſion of the Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that as our King would thereby diſguſ the Parliament, he could expect no Money
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0170800300:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from them of ſo long a time: And finally,  That when he wrote back to the Secretary, concerning this Tranſaction, he ſhould be ſilent as to the Money, and ſo on. Signed,</p>

               <hi>Danby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This put the Houſe into a Flame, and a Motion was inſtantly made, that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer ſhould be impeach'd of High Treaſon; for that he had endeavoured to eſtrange the King from his Parliament, and make it of no Uſe to him; and one Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That this was uſurping a Power to the Excluſion of other Councellors, who had a Right to adviſe the King as well as himſelf; the very Treaſon that was laid to the Charge of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>But it was anſwered, That it was no ſuch great Offence to write this by the King's own Order, as was expreſſed in the Letter it ſelf, and would be owned, as ſuppoſed, by the King at this Time. That the King had certainly a Power to adviſe with which of his Councellors he pleaſed; and that if his Majeſty foreſaw the Confederates would ſtrike up a Peace, which we muſt comply with, where was the Harm of making what Advantage we could of it to our ſelves, and at the ſame Time of ſparing the Purſes of the Subject?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0170800300:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 A ſecond Letter was produced, which gave Aſſurance of Inclinations for a very fair Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding between us and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; together with Advice to haſten the Peace; becauſe the Duke ſeemed every Day more and more averſe to it; and mentioned ſome Towns to be given up, by the <hi>French,</hi> as cautionary, to the Confederates, upon the Concluſion of this Peace. Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> then declared in the Houſe, That the <hi>French</hi> King was willing to deliver up two Towns more than he did by the former Treaty; but that my Lord Treaſurer was ſo earneſt and preſſing for Money, that he thereby made the Terms much worſe for the Confederates; but at the ſame Time acknowledged he could not ſay he knew of any Money paid either to him or to his Majeſty. Other Things were now laid to the Treaſurer's Charge, as the Male-adminiſtration of his Office, and the Lowneſs of the Exchequer: But to this it was anſwered, by his Lordſhip's Friends, That a Debt of ſix hundred thouſand Pounds had been paid off ſince he had been in Office, tho' no Money had in all that Time been given to the King, but what had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Uſes deſigned.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> was, in this Caſe, juſtly cenſured, for diſcloſing what had paſſed through his Hands, when a public Miniſter, without the King's Leave. Mean while, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Dec. 7.</label> the Treaſurer endeavoured to deſtroy the Credit of his Accuſer, and produced ſome Letter, from him, when in <hi>France,</hi> which were read in the Houſe, and made it appear that <hi>Montague</hi> had been very guilty of the Offences he threw upon his Lordſhip: But his Enemies were ſo many and ſo powerful, that the whole Edge was bent againſt him; in a Word, the Tide was not to be ſtemmed, and ſix Articles of Impeachment were drawn up againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0170800300:81"/>
 But a Debate aroſe, whether, ſuppoſing any of theſe Articles to be true, they amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to High Treaſon, none of them being within the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> III. At length the Queſtion being put, Whether or no an Impeachment of High Treaſon, founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaid Articles againſt his Lordſhip, ſhould be carried up to the Houſe of Lords, <label type="milestone">

being for one, and the King recommending  another; wherefore they refuſed to enter upon Buſineſs, but adjourned to the 7th In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>March 7.</label> then to the 8th, and ſo to the 10th. The next Day I met the King in his Royal Robes, and with his Crown upon his Head, as he came out of the Houſe of Lords: He ſtopped to ask me If I was elected? To which replying Yes, he ſaid, He was glad of it. Upon my Return to Town, I, to the ſurpriſe of all Men, found that the King had commanded the Duke to go into <hi>Flanders:</hi> Some ſaid the Treaſurer had brought this to paſs, that he might engroſs the King to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; others ſaid it was to divert the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of both Houſes againſt his Highneſs, from the Suſpicion of ſome that he was of the Plot. But I preſume it was chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to extirpate all Jealouſies in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, That he was influenced by Popiſh Councils, tho' even from his own Brother.</p>
            <p>The Commons began to be angry with the Treaſurer, for that the Speaker they had propoſed had been rejected by the King; ſaying he was the cauſe of it, becauſe, truly, the Gentleman was not his Lordſhip's Friend. This Diſpute ſubſiſting between the King and the Commons, they at length Addreſs him, Beſeeching him not to invade their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0170800300:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Privilege of chuſing their Speaker; but His Majeſty ſtill inſiſts on it, That without his Approbation, their Choice is of none Effect. Now all the Moderate Men in the Houſe were concerned That ſuch Punctilio's ſhould ſtand in the Way of Buſineſs, eſpecially when Buſineſs of ſuch High Importance lay before them; but the Angry Party was deaf to all Remonſtrance; and the King, by way of Expedient, prorogued the Parliament to the 11th Inſtant, and from thence to the 15th, when Serjeant <hi>Gregory</hi> being elected, both ſides were ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>The Storm now begins to fall heavy upon the Lord Treaſurer, inſomuch that he has Thoughts of delivering up his Staff, and with it his Office, in hopes by ſuch Reſignation to allay the Heats againſt him. I was averſe to this Step, I confeſs, and would have had him ſtood his ground, as long as the King would ſtand by him, ſaying, his Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would but expoſe him the more to the Power of his Enemies; in ſhort, that the Lords would fear him the leſs, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons not love him a bit the better. Several Perſons had got poſſeſſed of good Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not ſo much by my Lord's Favour and Kindneſs, as by giving Money to his Lady, who had for ſome time driven on a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0170800300:86"/>
private Trade of this ſort, tho' not without  his Lordſhip's participation and concurrence. This I knew, but had neither the Face nor the Inclination to come in at that Door; ſo that I was poſtponed to many, who, as I thought, deſerved as little as my ſelf; but they had but a bad Bargain, they were now all ſwept away with the ſame Torrent that began to overwhelm his Lordſhip; againſt whom freſh Matter now appeared, upon the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>March 17.</label> Evidence of <hi>Bedloe,</hi> before the Committee appointed to examine into the Plot, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the Treaſurer of having tampered with him to fly during this Interval of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And now every thing went harder and harder with his Lordſhip's Friends; ſo that my Election being controverted, the Committee of Privileges and Elections, in a few Days afterward, gave my Cauſe againſt me by a ſmall Majority of two only; which conſidering the Stream of the Times, I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to be as good as half a Victory at leaſt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time a Meſſage was ſent to <label type="milestone">

 Day the King coming to the Houſe of Lords, in the uſual State and Formality, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed both Houſes, That it was by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Order the Lord Treaſurer had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Two Letters, produced by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague:</hi> That it was not the Lord Treaſurer who had concealed the Plot, but that it was himſelf who told it his Lordſhip from time to time, as he thought fit. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty then declared he had granted the ſaid Nobleman a full Pardon, and that, if Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion required, he would give it him again Ten times over: That, however, he intended to lay him aſide from his Employments, and to forbid him the Court.</p>
            <p>Some would have peſuaded his Lordſhip to take Refuge abroad, as what would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe both Houſes: And indeed the Lords had a Conference with the Commons about preparing a Bill to baniſh him, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons deſired ſome Days to conſider of it, in hopes he would have withdrawn in that <label type="milestone">

In the midſt of this Perplexity I ſaw his Lordſhip at Midnight, as he came out of his Cloſet, from adviſing with his Friends what to do.

            <p>A moſt unhappy thing it is to ſerve a fickle Prince, which, it muſt be owned, was Part of our Maſter's Character. Had the Treaſurer conſidered no Body but himſelf, he might certainly have fared better; but he reſolved rather to ſuffer; than to do any thing that might derive any Diſhonour on the King, or others about him, as he has ſince ſaid himſelf. This great Change, I muſt own, made me ſeriouſly ponder the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certitude of human Grandeur: It was but a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0170800300:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 few Months before that few things were tranſacted at Court, but with the Privity or Conſent of this great Man; the King's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and favourite Miſtreſs, were glad to be fair with him, and the general Addreſs of all Men of Buſineſs was to him, who was not only Treaſurer, but prime Miniſter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; who not only kept the Purſe, but was the firſt and greateſt Confident in all Affairs of State. But now he is neglected of all, forced to hide his Head as a Criminal, and in danger of loſing all he has got, and his Life therewith: His Family raiſed from Privacy to the Degree of Marquiſs, (a Patent was then actually paſſing, to inveſt him with that Dignity) is now on the Brink of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing below the humble ſtand of a Yeoman; nor would almoſt the meaneſt Subject change Conditions with him now, who ſo very lately the greateſt beheld with Envy. This confirmed me in a Belief, that a Middle State is always the beſt; not ſo lowly as to be trodden on, nor ſo lofty as to fear the Blaſts of Envy. A Man ſhould not be ſo wanting in point of Induſtry, as not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſtinguiſh himſelf in ſome ſort from the Bulk of thoſe of his Rank; nor yet ſo ambitious as to ſacrifice the Eaſe of this Life, and of that to come, by mounting
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0170800300:90"/>
over the Heads of others, to a Greatneſs of  uncertain Duration. But to digreſs no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p>I wrote to his Royal Highneſs, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the Poſture of Affairs here at preſent. The Two Houſes of Parliament continued in Diviſion, as to what ſhould be inflicted on the fallen Treaſurer; the Lords adhering to their Bill to baniſh him, and the Commons to their Bill of Attainder, till at laſt it came to a free Conference between them.

            </p>
            <p>The King ſeemed not at all concerned at thus parting with his Brother, and his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer; nor in any Degree ſollicitous about the Uſe the Parliament would make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; tho' it was ſuſpected they would get their own Friends into Power, and obtain a ſnip of the Prerogative, in Conſideration of the Money they gave to his Majeſty.</p>

My Lord Viſcount <hi>Hallifax</hi> being now of  the Council, and entering into Buſineſs, he, tho' a great Enemy to the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> profeſſed a Kindneſs for me; but here I muſt obſerve, that moſt of the other Lords and Gentlemen of the Privy Council, tho' great Patriots before, in the Eſteem of both Houſes, began, in ſome Meaſure, to loſe their Credit with both, ſo true it is, That there is no wearing the Court and Country Livery together.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0170800300:93"/>
 Joy, that the old Gentleman could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from Tears; and that the third was to excuſe the conſent he gave to have his Daughter married to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and to acquaint him, that the run of the Times had obliged him to ſuch involuntary Compliance. Upon this and ſome further intimation of the ſame Nature, a Debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, whether a Bill ſhould be drawn up in the way his Majeſty had ſuggeſted, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould immediately proceed to a total Excluſion. The Friends for the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation argued, that we might be as ſafely ſecured the one way as the other; that a ſmall Revenue might be ſettled upon a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt Succeſſor while he contined in that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion; that the Militia might be taken out of his Hands; and that a Parliament might be impowered to aſſemble, whenever the preſent King ſhould die, and to ſit for ſix Weeks, in order to ſettle the Affairs of the Kingdom, to appoint Proteſtant Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Military and Civil, and to make Choice of Biſhops, which the Succeſſor, if a Papiſt, ſhould have no Power to nominate.</p>
            <p>To this it was objected, that ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Procedure were altering the very Frame and Conſtitution of our Government and Monarchy, and directly to reduce it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0170800300:94"/>
to a Republic; that it would be quite inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual;  that the King, by the fundamental Laws of the Land, was Head and Supreme of the three Eſtates; that a Parliament ſo convened as above, could enact nothing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid without him; that while he enjoyed the Title of King, he would exerciſe a Power adequate to his Office; and that therefore the means propoſed were deluſory and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, in compariſon of an utter Excluſion. It was replied, that this Expedient was by far more to be avoided than the former; that it was depriving the Duke of his Birthright; that if his Highneſs ſurvived, he had as clear a Claim to ſucceed the King, if he died Childleſs, as any Man whatever had to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to his Father's Poſſeſſions; that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a Prince of his Spirit would not eaſily ſubmit to be ſo diſinherited; that ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the Succeſſion had never, in this Kingdom, been of any laſting Effect; that Right had always prevailed at laſt; that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, upon the like Occaſions had been diſaſtrous to <hi>England;</hi> that Succeſs would reverſe all Attainder; and that ſhould his Highneſs force his way to the Crown, the overthrow of Religion and Government were more, much more, to be feared, than by his peaceful Acceſſion.</p>

            <p>Mean while the Kingdom in general had a very melancholy Aſpect; the King was poor; the Officers of the Crown and of the Houſhold were clamorous for their Salaries and Dues, which had not of a long time been paid, and no wonder, when Sir <hi>Robert Howard,</hi> one of the chief Officers of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, declared in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that there was not Money ſufficient for Bread for the King's Family; there were no Stores any where, either for the Sea Service or the Land; the Garriſons were all out of Repair, the Platforms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and the Cannon diſmounted; the Army divided, for the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, the Officers of State the ſame; the Parliament for the moſt part in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and glad of theſe public Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, as favoring their Deſire of clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was certainly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in the King's Affections, was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in Councils againſt his Uncle of <hi>York;</hi> for all his Creatures in the Houſe voted againſt his Highneſs, nor were any Men higher in his Eſtimation, than the Earls of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and other Chiefs of the Cabal.

And indeed, tho' at the Inſtances of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the King had openly in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil declared, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was but his Natural Son, and that he never

               <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who thought he had the King to himſelf, knew nothing of it, till his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs actually arrived at <hi>Windſor;</hi> nor were there above four Perſons who knew any thing at all of the Matter, ſo cloſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved could the King be, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it to be neceſſary. This Revocation of the Duke was principally owing to the Intervention of Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards told me the whole Story. And now it was thought that the Parliament, being chiefly made up of Excluſioniſts, would be but very ſhort-lived. The Duke however went back again, but it was only to fetch his Ducheſs, whom he had left behind him, returning preſently, with his whole Court from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and deſiring of the King, That if he muſt needs be abſent, he might rather remain in ſome Part of his Majeſty's Dominions, and ſo he was ſent into <hi>Scotland.</hi> His Highneſs then proceeded Northward; but Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> being ſoon after remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Excluſioniſts began to diſpair of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; nor was that all; for the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> having been ſent into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and returning without the King's Leave, drew ſuch Diſpleaſure on him, that he was diveſted of all his Employments.

            <p>The King was ſo highly pleaſed with the Tranſactions of this Day, that he, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, took this great Lord into Buſineſs; but, on the other Hand, the Commons were ſo angry with him, that though they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly take no Notice of what any Man ſaid in the other Houſe, they voted an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the King to lay him aſide, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from his Councils and Preſence. To this he anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That if Lord <hi>Halli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi>

One would have thought that ſo ſignal a Piece of Service, Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> did to his Highneſs, had been of a Degree and Nature never to be forgot: But when the Duke afterwards came to be King, he, from the Privy Seal, where he found him. removed him to the Preſidency of the Council, purely to make Room for another, and in the End quite laid him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>

I waited on him, and the next Day he took me in his Coach to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and invited me to dine with him in private; in our Converſation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he told me it was to be feared ſome unhappy Differences might diſtract the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from theſe Uneaſineſſes about the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: And that in caſe Things ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ripen to a War, it might be proper to form ſomething of a Party in ones own Thoughts.

But to turn our Eyes upon what juſtly  claimed the Attention of all Men, now came on the Tryal of Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> by his Peers. <label type="milestone">

               <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> was the Place, and I think it was the deepeſt Solemnity I ever ſaw. Great were the Expectations of the Iſſue of this Event, it being doubtful whether there were more who believed there was any Plot by the Papiſts in reality againſt the King's Life, than not. He was impeached by the Commons, and being deemed to be weaker than the other Lords in the Tower, for the ſame Crime, and leſs able to labour his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, was purpoſely marked out to be the firſt brought on; but he deceived them ſo far as to plead his Cauſe to a Miracle. The three chief Evidences againſt him, were Dr. <hi>Oates, Dugdale,</hi> and <hi>Turberville:</hi> The firſt ſwore that his Lordſhip had brought him a Commiſſion ſigned by the Pope, to be Paymaſter of the Army to be raiſed againſt the King; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, That he had offered him five hundred Pounds to kill the King; and the third, That he had offered him a Reward for the dreadful Deed, but at a different Time. And ſo poſitive ſeemingly were they in this and other dangerous Evidence, that I, who ſat and heard moſt of the Tryal, had not known what to think, had the Witneſſes
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0170800300:111"/>
 been but Men of any the leaſt Credit; but indeed ſuch were the Incoherences, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Contradictions which ſeemed to me to ariſe towards the latter End, that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and the very evil Name of the People that ſwore againſt this Lord, I was fully ſatisfied that all was untruth they laid to his Charge: But the poor Gentleman was condemned by a Majority of 22. He heard his Accuſers, and defended himſelf with great Steadineſs and Reſolution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Sentence with great Courage and Compoſure; nor did he ſtoop beneath the Weight of his Doom, till he ſubmitted his Head to the Block, with his laſt Breath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting his Innocence, and the cruel Wrong he ſuffered. My Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> was one that gave his Voice for him; and the King who heard all his Tryal, was extremely concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Rigour and Abruptneſs of his Fate.</p>

This ſame Day the Commons were asked, What they would do for the King after ſo long a Sitting to no Effect, as to the Matters his Majeſty required
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0170800300:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of them?

There were many who believed the King would be tempted to comply; but, the very next Day, ſeeing my Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> he aſſured me there was not the leaſt probability that he would, for <hi>That it was like offering a Man Money to cut off his Noſe.</hi>

 I was at the King's Couchée, when there <label type="milestone">

However, there were of the Men, ſo pointed out, ſome whom the King had no Reaſon to love upon a political Account, which may be pleaded in Abatement of the Acrimony of his Cenſure. He was that Night two full Hours in putting off his Cloaths, and it was half an Hour paſt One before he went to bed. He ſeemed to be quite free from Care and Trouble, tho' one would have thought, at this Time, he ſhould have been overwhelmed therewith; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body now imagined he muſt either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs the Parliament in a few Days, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf up to their preſſing Deſires; but

In this Strain did he hurry on, while no Soul dared to oppoſe him, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a Party of the Plot; till, no longer able to bear with the Inſolence of the Man, I took him to task to ſuch Purpoſe, that he flung out of the Room with ſome Heat. The Biſhop told me that ſuch was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Drift of his Diſcourſe, that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times checked him for the indecency of his Talk, but that finding he had done it to no manner of Purpoſe, he had deſiſted from any further Effort to ſet bounds to his Viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

The ſame Day I dined with my Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> who ſaid to me, <hi>Well, if it comes to a War, you and I muſt go together.</hi> I told his Lordſhip, I ſhould be ready to follow him, happen what would; but that if the King expected his Friends to be hearty in his Cauſe, and ſteady to his Perſon, he ſhould conſider with himſelf, and encourage them a little; and thereupon acquainted him with ſome of my Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Court, notwithſtanding the moſt ſolemn reiterated Promiſes; and added, that I ſhould be glad his Majeſty would ſend me his Envoy to ſome Part of the World or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Waiting this Day on Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> he complained much of the Severity of the Commons in their Vote, <hi>That he was a Promoter of Popery, and a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer of the People,</hi> which, ſaid he, were a Man ever ſo innocent, yet coming from the repreſentative Body of the People, is too heavy for the Shoulders of any one ſingle Perſon; that he had therefore ſome Thoughts of retiring from Court; but that, however, he would go his own Pace, and not be kicked out at their Pleaſure. That if for the future the King ſhould have Occaſion for him, in any thing that was juſt, he ſhould be ready to ſerve him: That if I would repoſe a Confidence in him, he would let me know when it was Time to appear for the King's Service, and that I ſhould ſhare Fortunes with him, and ſo on. But, at the ſame time, he complained of the Fickleneſs and Incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the King's Temper; and obſerved, that while he ſeemed perfectly to approve of the Council you gave him, he hearkned to others from a back Door, which made him wavering of Mind, and ſlow to reſolve.

And yet the firſt Point debated was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, notwithſtanding the King's Speech, a Bill of Excluſion ſhould not be framed and brought in? But for the preſent it was only voted, That the Security of his Majeſty's Perſon, and of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould be taken into Conſideration the 26th inſtant.</p>
            <p>Not to inſiſt on the Impeachment of <hi>Fitz-harris,</hi> which was done not to deſtroy, but to ſerve him in oppoſition to the Court; the grand Argument for the Bill of Excluſion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0170800300:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was, That nothing could preſerve us from  Popery but that alone. Now the whole Houſe was of Opinion, that Popery was to be kept out, the Diſpute was only as to the Means of effecting it. The King had, in his Speech, offered to agree to any thing that might ſerve to quiet the Minds of the People as to that particular, the utter Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Brother only excepted. It was therefore moved by Sir <hi>Thomas Littleton,</hi> That a Bill, to ſecure the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould be brought in, and conſiſt of the following Heads; That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſhould enjoy the Title, and the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> exerciſe the Power. That if a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould be in Being, when it ſhould pleaſe God to take away the preſent King, they ſhould have Power to ſit: That the Judges, and all other Officers of the Crown, ſhould be continued, till Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty were ſecured: That if there was no Parliament ſubſiſting, one ſhould aſſemble of Courſe: And that to prevent the Duke's interfering to prevent this, he ſhould, by the ſame Act, be baniſhed to the Diſtance of 500 Miles from <hi>England,</hi> not to return as long as the King lived. To this it was objected, That the Name and Power of King were inſeparable by the Laws

But Excluſion was the Word: Some ſeven or eight diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lawyers, and able Speakers, joined by ſome others, who had been ſo active in this Matter, that they thought, ſhould the Duke ever come to the Crown, he could never forgive them, wrought ſo prevalently upon the Members in general, that it was voted a Bill ſhould be brought in, To incapacitate <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> from ſucceeding to the Imperial Crown of this Realm; nor during this Debate did ſome forbear to reflect on his Highneſs's Courage and Honour.</p>

            <p>His Majeſty was ſo kind as to afford me ſeveral Opportunities of ſpeaking to him, while I was at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> taking leave of him, and, in a particular manner, recommending me to his Thoughts, his Majeſty laid both his Hands upon me, and thanked me for my Conſtancy to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and bad me be aſſured of his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

By this abrupt Diſſolution, and what I  had heard from Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> and others, I concluded the King was determined ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to relinquiſh his Brother; as alſo to call no other Parliament for a long time yet to come. The Truth is, the Queſtion now was not ſo much, Whether the Duke ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed or not, as whether the Government ſhould be Monarchial, or Republican? Some of the adverſe ſide, had, in the Houſe, bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled out, That the Bill of Excluſion was not the only material Bill they intended to get paſſed this Seſſion, in order to ſecure the People of <hi>England</hi> from falling a Prey to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and arbitrary Power: That it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the Military and Civil Power too ſhould be lodged in other Hands, and that the preſent Officers of both ſhould be called to an Account and changed: Whence the King being told, That if he quitted his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it would be but an immediate Step taken to ruin all his Friends and Servants, and to become himſelf expoſed to the Will and Wiſhes of thoſe, whom he had no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think were over and above affected to him, the King dreaded the Conſequences, and reſolved accordingly.</p>
            <p>I was at the King's Couchée, as I was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0170800300:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 three Times in one Week; his Diſcourſe ran <label type="milestone">

And now we begin to have a Proſpect of Halcyon Days again; for his Majeſty having, ſince the laſt Parliament was diſſolved, iſſued out a Declaration fraught with the faireſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to his People, and aſſuring them of his firm Intentions to govern inviolably accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law, and the like; it had ſo happy an Effect, that he received the Thanks of the City of <hi>London,</hi> by the Lord Mayor, and of ſeveral Counties and Corporations in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

That he had as good be enlarged upon Terms, as by a Jury which would moſt aſſuredly acquit him were he brought to a Tryal, tho' ever ſo deep in Guilt; and that were he out, he could not do the King ſo much harm, as ſuch an Act of Mercy and Popularity would do him good. The ſame Day, one of the under Secretaries told me, the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to proſecute him to the utmoſt, and that there was no want of very ſufficient Matter againſt him.</p>
            <p>But before we come to the Iſſue of ſuch his Majeſty's Reſolution, it may not be amiſs

Times, for it was ſhrewdly ſuſpected he  was not in earneſt, ſent for the Juſtices of <hi>Middleſex</hi> to appear before him in Council, where he gave them a ſevere Reprimand, for that they were ſo remiſs in their Inquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Number of Papiſts, and ſo backward to proſecute them. He ſpoke not himſelf, but did it by the Lord Chancellor, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to be more vigilant, mindful, and active for the time to come.</p>
            <p>The ſame Day, having been to viſit the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> took me home with him from <hi>Whitehall.</hi> On the Way, I acquainted him that the general Report was, That his Lordſhip oppoſed the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Intereſt with the King, and his Return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> which his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs moſt urgently preſſed. His Reply was, That it was well if the Duke's overhaſtineſs did not turn to his Diſadvantage; that his Highneſs had a ſort of hungry Servants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, who were eternally preſſing for his Return, nor would ever let him be at reſt, till, with a View to their own Intereſt, they put their Maſter upon what might prove much to his Prejudice. And true it is that whilſt his Highneſs was near the King's Perſon, every Body believed his Majeſty to be principally ſwayed and actuated by his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0170800300:133"/>
 Advice; and conſequently That Popiſh Councils were then uppermoſt; whereas he did a great deal of good in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by keeping a watchful Eye over that mutinous Kingdom. But the Papiſts, and others, his Highneſſes Creatures, pretended he was kept in <hi>Scotland</hi> That his Enemies might the more eaſily work him out of his Brother's good Opinion; and that the Miniſters might have the King all to themſelves, and guide him according to their own Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Upon this Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> obſerved There was great Partiality in the Judgment of Men; for that in common Juſtice they ought to take as much Notice of Things that were managed for the Duke's Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as of what ſeemed to be otherwiſe: That, for Inſtance, no Body had commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Miniſters for getting the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> to be Maſter of the Horſe in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> tho' it muſt prove a great Obſtacle to his Return to the King's Perſon, and tho' moſt evident it was That no greater Service could be done to his Highneſs, than to keep the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> from Court.</p>
            <p>About this Time I had a View of going <label type="milestone">

At the ſame time I conducted a Gentleman to my Lord, to ask his Pardon for ſome Things he had been reported to have ſaid againſt his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. In good Policy, we ought to ſuffer no Man to be our Enemy, if we can poſſibly avoid it; but ſuch was his Lordſhip's natural Diſpoſition, that, in the whole Courſe of my Life, I never knew a Man more ready, at all Times, to forgive, and ſhall never forget his Expreſſion upon this Occaſion, <hi>Sir, if you did not ſay the Words I am very glad of it, and even if you did, I am glad you find Cauſe to be of another Mind.</hi> In a private Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation I, at the ſame time, had with his Lordſhip, he told me, That the People about the Duke of <hi>York</hi> made him mad; that there was ſcarce one of them that had a Grain of Senſe; and intimated that a Parliament could not be far off.</p>

I on the Spot granted ſeveral Warrants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Perſons ſuſpected to have had a Hand therein, and that Night got ſome Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence concerning the Actors themſelves. At length, by the Information of a Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had carried one of the Ruſſians from his Lodging at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to the Black Bull, there to take Horſe, and by Means of a looſe Woman, who uſed to viſit the ſame Perſon, the Conſtables found out the Place of his abode, and there took his Man, by Nation a <hi>Swede,</hi> who being brought before me, confeſſed himſelf a Servant to a <hi>German</hi> Captain, who had told him he had a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with Mr. <hi>Thynn,</hi> and had often ordered him to watch his Coach; and that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that Day the Captain no ſooner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Coach to be gone by, than he booted himſelf, and with two others, a <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> Lieutenant and a <hi>Pole,</hi> went on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, as he ſuppoſed in queſt of Mr. <hi>Thynn.</hi>

I wondered he ſhould make ſo tame a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for he was certainly a Man of great Courage, and appeared quite unconcerned from the very Beginning, tho' he was very certain he ſhould be found the chief Actor in the Tragedy. This Gentleman had, not long before, commanded the forlorn Hope, at the Siege at <hi>Mons,</hi> when but two, beſides himſelf, of fifty under his Command, eſcaped with Life; and, in conſideration of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> made him a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of his Guards, and, in Reward for the ſame, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> gave him a Troop of Horſe: But to inſiſt no farther on this, his two Accomplices alſo were taken, and brought to my Houſe, where before I could finiſh the ſeveral Examinations I had to go through, the King ſent for me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

His Majeſty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to give him an Account of the Proceedings hitherto, as well with regard to the apprehending of the Priſoners, as their Examination, and then examined them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and when the Council roſe, ordered me to put every thing into Writing, and in Form, againſt the Trial; which took me up a great part of the Day, tho' I had got one of the Clerks of the Council, and another Juſtice of the Peace to aſſiſt me, both for the Sake of Diſpatch and my own Security, the nicety of the Affair requiring it, as will, in the Sequel, appear.</p>

Upon this Occaſion, the King ſent for me, to attend in Council, where the ſaid Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor confeſſing, That the eldeſt Count <hi>Coningſmark,</hi> who had been in <hi>England</hi> ſome Months before, and made his Addreſſes to the Lady who ſo unfortunately married Mr. <hi>Thynn,</hi> arrived <hi>incognito</hi> ten Days before the ſaid Murther, and lay diſguiſed till it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0170800300:142"/>
That the Count was at the Bottom of this  bloody Affair; and his Majeſty ordered me thereupon to go and ſearch his Lodgings, which I did with two Conſtables, but the Bird was flown; he went away betimes in the Morning of the Day after the Deed was perpetrated; of which I immediately gave the King an Account.</p>
            <p>I ſeveral Times afterwards attended on the King, both in private and in Council, from time to time to give him Information, as freſh matter occurred, or appeared; and upon the whole it was diſcovered, partly by the Confeſſion of the Parties concerned, and partly by the Information of others, That the <hi>German</hi> Captain had been for eight Years an Intimate with Count <hi>Coningſmark,</hi> one of the greateſt Men in the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> his Uncle being at that time Governor of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and near upon marrying the King's Aunt; and moreover that during the Time he was in <hi>England</hi> before, he had made his Addreſſes to Lady <hi>Ogle,</hi> the only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heireſs of the Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who had been marryed to the deceas'd Mr. <hi>Thynn,</hi> and that the ſaid Count had reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething as an Affront from Mr. <hi>Thynn:</hi> That the Captain, moved thereto out of pure Friendſhip to the Count, tho' not at all with

 his Privity, as pretended, had determined within himſelf to revenge his Cauſe, and that in Conſequence of ſuch his Reſolution the Murther hapned: It appeared alſo that ſuch his cruel Deſign was furthered by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Lieutenant, and the <hi>Pole</hi> who had been by him obliged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Blunderbuſs into the Coach. I was extremely glad that in this whole Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there was no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Perſon directly or indirectly concerned; for the Fanatics had buzzed it about That the Deſign was chiefly againſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> ſo that I had the King's Thanks more than once, the Thanks of my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for my Diligence in tracing out the true Springs and Motives of this horrid Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as the Actors themſelves. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had been out of the Coach above an Hour, and, by the Confeſſion of the Criminals, I found they were not to have made the Attempt if his Grace had been with Mr. <hi>Thynn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mean while it was ſuſpected that Count <hi>Coningſmark</hi> was ſtill in the Kingdom; and ſearch being made after him, he was met with alone in Diſguiſe at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> by a Servant of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s, juſt as he was ſtepping out of a Sculler, intending

the very next Day to embark on Board of  a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ship. Being brought up to Town, the King immediately called an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Council to examine him. I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon this Occaſion, and obſerved that he appeared before the King with all the Aſſurance imaginable. He was a fine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Man, and I think his Hair was the longeſt I ever ſaw. He was very quick of Parts, but his Examination was very ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, for which Reaſon he was by the King and Council ordered to be, the ſame Day, examined by the Lord Chief Juſtice, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General, and my ſelf, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed nothing of the Murder, pretending the Reaſon why he lay at this time conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be that he was then under Cure for a ſmall Venereal Diſaſter, and did not care to appear in public, till the Courſe of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription was over; and that his going away in Diſguiſe after the Fact was committed, was by the Advice of Friends, who told him it would reflect on him ſhould it be known he was in <hi>England,</hi> when an Intimate of his laboured under ſo violent a Suſpicion of having committed ſo black a Deed; and that he endeavoured to make his Eſcape, not knowing how far the Laws of this Land might for that very Reaſon involve him in

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>26</label> A few Days afterwards, Monſ. <hi>Foubert</hi> who kept the Academy in <hi>London,</hi> came and deſired me to put him in a way how to ſave Count <hi>Coningſmark</hi>'s Life, inſinuating to me, That as he was a Man of vaſt Fortune, he could not make a better Uſe of it than to ſupport his own Innocence, and ſhield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Edge of the Law, in a ſtrange Country. I told him, That if the Count was really innocent, the Law would natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquit him, as much tho' a Foreigner as if he was a Native; but that he ought to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious how he made any Offers to pervert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; for that it were to make all Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Enemies, inſtead of gaining them to be his Friends. This was one of the firſt Bribes of Value ever offered to me, which I might have accepted without any Danger of Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and without doing much for it: But my Opinion has always been that what is ſo acquired is no Addition to our Store, but rather the Cauſe of its Waſte, according to the Saying, <hi>Male parta male delabuntur;</hi> I therefore rejected this now as I had done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before, and as I hope I ſhall always do for the time to come.</p>

I was the firſt that carried the News of this to the King, who ſeemed to be not at all diſpleaſed at it; but the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Party, who all appeared to add Weight to the Proſecution, were extremely diſſatisfied that the Count had ſo eſcaped.</p>

            <p>Having thus concluded the Hiſtory of this remarkable Tranſaction, I ſhall only, by the way, obſerve that I was ſoon after appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed  Governor of <hi>York,</hi> in Oppoſition to a ſtrong <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>May 9.</label> and potent Intereſt againſt me. About this Time I had a very long Converſation with my good Friend the Earl of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſteady for a Parliament; and expreſſed himſelf of Opinion, That the Duke had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no great Aſcendant over the King, by his late Journey into <hi>England,</hi> from whence he was now upon his return to <hi>Scotland;</hi> a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney quite diſagreeable even to the King's own Friends; and indeed he was chiefly perſuaded to it by his Servants, who gained by his being here.</p>
            <p>The next Day came News, That his Highneſs had been in great Danger of being caſt away in his Voyage back to the North, the Ship he was in having ſtruck upon <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Sands, and that a great Number of the Paſſengers had been loſt, a Piece of News that was at firſt contradicted, but in <label type="milestone">

That the <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> a third Rate, in  which the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had embarked for <hi>Scotland,</hi> had actually ſuffered Shipwreck upon one of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Sands, called the <hi>Lemon</hi> and <hi>Oar;</hi> and that the Duke, with about an 160 Perſons were ſaved: among thoſe that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were the Lords <hi>O Brian,</hi> and <hi>Roxborough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hyde,</hi> Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Brother.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>May 22.</label> Waiting this Day on my Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> he told me that the Day before, being <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> came to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prayers, and asked him if it was true That his Lordſhip, as was reported, had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the King in Council, to iſſue out a Proclamation to forbid every Body from keeping him company: And that he had anſwered, That he was not obliged to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him, whether he had ſo adviſed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty or not; and that the Duke replyed there would be no need of a Proclamation to prevent him from keeping his Lordſhip Company, and that in another Place he would have ſaid more to him, and ſo went away.</p>
            <p>It muſt be by all confeſſed that his Grace in this acted a very imprudent Part, for he muſt needs have known that his thus que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning a Privy Councellor concerning Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given by him at the Board, would ſound
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0170800300:149"/>
 very harſh to the King: And on the other Hand, if his Intentions were really for a Quarrel, he might have choſen a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place, and have ſaid more, or nothing at all. I offered to ſerve his Lordſhip with my Life upon this Occaſion; but he was ſo very good as to ſay, That if it came to a Neceſſity of that ſort, he would make uſe of ſomebody he did not eſteem ſo much as he did me; but that, however, he did not think himſelf obliged to fight upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; tho' he ſhould ever be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf while he wore a Sword by his Side.</p>
            <p>The next Day a Council was held at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where, as ſoon as it was up, his Lordſhip told me an Order had been paſſed to this Effect, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that Whereas the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had been guilty of ſome threatning Speeches to a Member of that Board, in relation to ſomething of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his Majeſty in Council; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty conſidered the ſame as an unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inſolence towards himſelf; and did therefore charge all his Servants, and all ſuch as had Dependance on him, not to keep Company with, or frequent the ſaid Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> for the time to come."</q>

I had ſoon after a Conference with Lord  <hi>Hallifax,</hi> wherein I obſerved to him, That <label type="milestone">

He told me he was very ſenſible of the Truth and Importance of what I ſaid, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he could not avoid the Freedom I condemned in the Courſe of Buſineſs, and hoped his Integrity would ſupport him. At this Time he gave me Directions how to behave in the North, but they were ſuch as in common political Prudence muſt be here ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>And now I retired to my Government of <hi>York,</hi> where, tho' many Tranſactions were pretty remarkable they are of too private and particular a Nature to be here enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; I ſhall therefore only obſerve, That the City of <hi>York</hi> had been more noted than moſt Places in <hi>England,</hi> for the height and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulence of Faction, but that after I had been there ſome time, finding ſome of the Leaders willing to abate of their Warmth, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged myſelf in ſome private Diſcourſe with Mr. Alderman <hi>Ramſden,</hi> one of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary of the whole Fraternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0170800300:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ſo well explained to him the Danger they were in, if they did not ſhew ſome ſpeedy Signs of Remorſe and Repentance for their former Behaviour, That he confeſſed himſelf ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Errors committed upon ſeveral Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in that they had ſo often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their Choice of ſuch Members as they knew to be quite ungrateful to the King; in that they had ſo handſomely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Duke of <hi>York</hi> when he paſſed through their City, in his way to <hi>Scotland;</hi> and in that they had petitioned for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but never addreſſed or abhorred: But that after all he was afraid their Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were too enormous to be pardoned, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Conſideration leſs than the ſurrender of their Charter, which they did not know how to think of. I then asked him what he thought the City might be perſuaded to do by way of ſome Atonement: To which he anſwered, they might be brought to do three Things if they might be accepted. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To lay aſide Alderman <hi>Thompſon,</hi> a peeviſh Antimonarchial Fellow, to whom it fell of Courſe to be Lord Mayor the next Year, provided his Majeſty would, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, command them ſo to do. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To chuſe a new High Steward, and to offer the Honour to his Royal Highneſs, in lieu of

the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whom they would  put out, or in caſe his Highneſs ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, to his Lordſhip of <hi>Hallifax;</hi> and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to elect better Members for that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when Occaſion ſhould offer.

That as for their chuſing his Highneſs to be their High Steward, he judged it improper and unfit upon many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; and as for-himſelf, he was willing to put himſelf upon the Iſſue of what they

that Lord, who had laboured all he could  againſt him in the late Parliaments, than to himſelf, who had done all he could to ſerve him, and who had particularly made the moſt conſiderable Head againſt the Bill of Excluſion; and touched upon ſome hard Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns and Diſappointments of the ſame kind, from the ſame Quarter. But ſtill his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was well with the King, it was in no Degree in their Power to remove him, tho' they combined their whole Strength to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it: And indeed I had Reaſon to know how large an Influence he had over his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; for to him it was wholly owing that I ſat ſtill in my Government of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A few Days afterwards, his Lordſhip told me of ſome hard Uſage he had met with from Lord <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> contrary to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Engagements, in favor of each other, upon his firſt entring into Buſineſs; and that having obtained a Promiſe to be Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, or Lord Privy Seal, as a Vacancy of either ſhould firſt fall out, which hapned to be of the Seal, Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> had behind the Curtain done all in his Power for Mr. <hi>Seymour;</hi> that upon this Occaſion he had been raiſed to the Dignity of Marquiſs, which he had never deſired, with a View to make him amends for the Seal; but that not declining

 the one or the other he had obtained both; and that thereupon <hi>Seymour</hi> had left the Court. That however, the King command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he was willing to be upon good Terms with his Lordſhip, but that he muſt give him ſome ſufficient Aſſurance that he was more a Friend to him than to <hi>Sunderland,</hi> ere he could repoſe any Degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him. That in the mean Time he would keep in his Corner, and be attentive to whatever might be for the King's Service, and not be afraid to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Majeſty with what might be for his Majeſty's Diſadvantage, whoever were the Actors or Tranſactors; and in fine, that when he had Power, he ſhould be careful to diſtinguiſh thoſe who were his Friends, from thoſe who were not ſo.</p>
            <p>Now the Affair of the forty thouſand Pounds, ſaid to have been loſt to the King, upon his Hearth-Money, and charged upon Lord <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the other Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Treaſury, came to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by Counſel on both Sides, before the King; and it plainly appeared that the King was actually ſo much a Loſer; but ſuch was the Intereſt that Lord <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> ſupported as he was by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> had with
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0170800300:156"/>
his Majeſty, that little or no Notice of the  Fraud was taken at that Time: Except of ſome of that Lord's Friends having taken the Liberty to cenſure Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> as too buſy in making the Diſcovery, the King ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified him ſo far as to ſay openly that Day, in Court, upon the Trial, That his Lordſhip had done nothing in the whole Affair, but by his Order and Approbation. My Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> told me this was not the only Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that would appear, as to the ill Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Royal Revenue, and obſerved That the anticourt Party courted him at ſuch a Rate, that he feared it might create a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy elſewhere.</p>
            <p>A few Days afterwards his Lordſhip told me the Duke made it his Buſineſs to clear himſelf from having had any concern on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Side, for the Fraud on the one Hand, and the Diſcovery on the other, were the general Talk of the Town, but that his Highneſs ſhould apply to him, before he would apply to his Highneſs. He told me alſo that he had, the Day before, been with the King, and that he was two Hours in private with him; and that he had obſerved to his Majeſty, That a Report was ſpread as if Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was to have the Lord High Treaſurer's Staff delivered to him; but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0170800300:157"/>
 that he was in Hopes there was no ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, for that it would be a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon himſelf, and look as if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty thought he had done wrong to the Man whom he immediately ſo favour'd; and that his Majeſty ſhould ſay, <hi>The Man ſhould not be Lord Treaſurer the ſooner for what he had lately done as Lord</hi> Rocheſter; and that his Majeſty was angry with him for giving Ear to ſo groundleſs a Rumour.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Feb. 28.</label> Two Days afterwards, Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> told me The Duke had aſſured him, he was not in the leaſt concerned in the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Lord <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> and that he had replyed, he was ſure his Highneſs could wiſh him no ill, and that if he did, he ſhould never do any thing to oppoſe him, but that in ſuch a Caſe he ſhould not be able to ſerve him with that Zeal he could with, and that his Highneſs might poſſibly repent he had loſt his Service to the Degree he deſired to uſe it for him: That he had done no more than he had been by the King commanded to do, and that there was no Man in the Kingdom ſo great that he could be decently diſpleaſed with what was done at the King's Command: That he perceived they, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> had a mind to rid their Hands of him, and that it was likely they might
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0170800300:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
endeavour to make him uneaſy in his Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,  but that he would take care they ſhould not remove him, <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe he would ſtay with the King to be ready to ſerve him, and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe he had a Mind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint thoſe who ſo earneſtly longed for his Abſence: That his whole View had been to ſave the King Money, and that he knew no greater Service that could be done to his Highneſs, if he would but be pleaſed to look a little before him into Futurity: That the King indeed had made him a greater Man than he deſerved to be, but that he had this to ſay for himſelf, He was a Gentleman, and that his Highneſs ought in Juſtice to have ſome Conſideration for thoſe that bore Eſcutcheons, as well as for thoſe that had none; ſome of the Duke's Creatures were ſcarce Gentlemen; and that for his Part he ſhould never ſay any thing to his Highneſs but Truth, which tho', at firſt Sight, it might look a little plain and homely, nothing at the Bottom carryed with it a greater Fund of Reſpect and much more to the ſame Effect. That to this his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made Anſwer, That what his Lordſhip had ſaid ſeemed to be very rational, that he was ſenſible of great Obligations he had to him, and that he never would forget them,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0170800300:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 but ſerve him in all he was able, and that ſo his Lordſhip ſhould find.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip alſo told me, the ſame Day, That he had been with my Lady Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and that, among other Diſcourſe, he told her, He found that in caſe he ſhould ſtand in need of his Majeſty's Favor, he was not to expect many Friends on that Side of <hi>Whitehall;</hi> and that ſhe made Anſwer, That ſome who had been very much his Friends, meaning <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> came thither ſometimes, and that ſhe hoped they would be as much his Friends again: That to this he replyed, He was in much Doubt as to her Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and good offices, in ſuch a ſtrait, but hoped he ſhould avoid the Danger of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Uſe thereof; and took Notice that ſhe thereupon bluſhed, and ſeemed to be in ſome Confuſion. His Lordſhip further ſaid, That were he quite as young as he had been, he might be as well with her as others; but upon this I obſerved, That his Lordſhip ought to have been furniſhed with a good Purſe as well as ſomething elſe that began with the ſame Letter; for ſo, Report ſaid, Lord <hi>Danby</hi> kept Intelligence ſo long and ſo great with her.</p>
            <p>The Court and the whole Town were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely divided as to the Diſpute between

            <p>Going with my Lord Privy Seal, to take the Air, in <hi>Hyde Park,</hi> he told me he hoped I was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſorry he preſſed me to come up to <hi>London,</hi> ſeeing I could not ſo well have been made acquainted with the State of Affairs at ſuch a Diſtance as <hi>York:</hi> That it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain how long he ſhould be able to keep his Station, driven at ſo fiercely as he was by ſome, but that he imagined he had the King to his Friend, and could not conceive he would part with him for no other Fault than the having obeyed his Commands; but ſays he if we fall again under the Influence of <hi>French</hi> Councils, I ſhall fairly quit, there being greater Endeavours againſt me on the other Side of the Water, than on this; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me when I got into the Country again, to turn the Report of his Diſgrace into Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, till he ſhould give me Notice of his Retreat, which he would early do, if he found it unavoidable.</p>
            <p>Two Days afterwards, I went to ſee Lord <hi>Danby</hi> in the Tower, and found him to expreſs himſelf much more obligingly towards Lord Privy Seal, than he had been uſed to do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; among other Things, he ſaid his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0170800300:162"/>
had taken a prudent and becoming  Courſe in declaring himſelf for a Parliament, and that he was very glad of it upon a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Account; for that he deſpaired of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enlarged till there was a Sitting. He ſaid, Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and his Party might ſupport themſelves for a while, but that the Intereſt they built upon was no better than a ſandy Foundation.</p>
            <p>The next Day I communicated this to Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> who on his Part ſeemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be more favourably inclined towards Lord <hi>Danby,</hi> than he had for ſome time been: He ſaid he had already Enemies enough, and that what he had to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Lord was now out of his Mind; but that however he would not now make himſelf Enemies by being his Friend, as he had formerly done by being otherwiſe; ſo that I found Lord Privy Seal was making up his Intereſt on the one hand, as Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was on the other, for the latter had ſent for <hi>Seymour</hi> to Court, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be his Friend. Lord Privy Seal told me that <hi>Seymour</hi> had made ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to cloſe with him, and that a general Reconciliation was endeavouring on the part of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s Friends. I told his Lordſhip, That, in my poor Opinion, he had much
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0170800300:163"/>
 better ſtand by himſelf, now that he had poſſeſſed himſelf of the Intereſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the Means of what he had done in Oppoſition to Lord <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> that if he cloſed in with that Side again, he might run the Hazard of loſing the good Opinion of his Country, which he now ſo deſervedly enjoyed, whereas if he kept himſelf ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he might be Maſter of both the one and the other; and that ſet the Caſe he ſhould fall, the King would ſoon be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch a want of him, that he could not long be ſpared from Court. To this his Lordſhip replyed, It would be matter of great Difficulty for him to ſtay there with Men, whoſe Intereſt it was to remove him. That they would be apt to play him Tricks, knowing that while he was in any Play, their Carriage and Conduct would be no Secrets to his Majeſty; but that if they did engroſs the King all to themſelves they would not long keep their Hold; for that the King had one Quality which would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſerve him from being long in ill Hands, meaning his facility to hear all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to admit of all Informations from a Back-door, while the Favourites did not in the leaſt dream of ſuch his Atttention. His Lordſhip then lamented the prodigious
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0170800300:164"/>
Influence the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver  the King, complaining that ſhe betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not in his Councils only, but his Bed alſo, and that ſhe certainly lay with the Grand Prior of <hi>France,</hi> who often came over, under the Mask of Love, the better and more effectually to tranſmit Intelligence and Information to his Maſter the <hi>French</hi> King. He urged it That the King was too paſſive with regard to theſe Things, and obſerved it as his greateſt Fault, That no Argument could prevail on him to reſent what he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaw he ought to reſent, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended too low ſrom the ſublime Elevation of his Dignity. His Lordſhip then took Notice, that I alſo, in my Station was the Subject of much Envy, and adviſed me, when I returned again into the Country, to demean my ſelf ſo as to gain as great a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Favor and Benevolence as I decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I perceived that the Lord Privy Seal had the better and more approved Cauſe, and that the Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> had the more potent and overuling Intereſt; that the Lord Privy Seal deſervedly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Body of the Nation, and that the Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> weighed, tho' undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly enough, only with the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0170800300:165"/>
 the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and others at Court, who depended upon his Majeſty's Purſe, which laboured the Diſtribution of Lord <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> In ſhort the Fear was, That the Diligence of thoſe ſo near the King might prevail on him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the Lord Privy Seal, who depended upon himſelf only, upon no Intereſt but his own, and upon the Merit, which was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly great, of the important Services he had already done, and was beſt able for the future to do for the Crown; and here we put a Period to this Year.</p>

The Ducheſs took this very kindly, and upon receiving the Patent for that Office, which the City preſented to the young Duke in a Gold Box, her Grace ſent my Lord Mayor a Letter of Thanks, wherein ſhe ſaid the King was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well pleaſed that the ſecond City in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had had that Regard for her Son, and aſſured him and the Corporation of her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>June 26.</label> In <hi>June</hi> following, we were alarmed with a Report of a dangerous Conſpiracy againſt the King, of ſuch as had been diſappointed of Preferments at Court, and of Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters. The ſame Conſpiracy was alſo againſt the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Deſign was to have ſhot both his Majeſty and his Highneſs as they came from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> the Day of their Return being fixed. This was to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by forty Men, who, the Blow given, were to have ſcoured to <hi>London,</hi> and to have reported it to have been done by the Papiſts. In <hi>London</hi> it was ſaid there were a Body of Men ready to riſe, and to take immediate poſſeſſion of the City and Tower, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the whole Nation, and that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was ready to head the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
            <p>This was miraculouſly defeated by a fire which burned down a great Part of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0170800300:167"/>
 Town of <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and cauſed the King's Departure from thence ten Days ſooner than was at firſt intended. The Deſign thus fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, it was afterward renewed to kill the two Royal Brothers as they came from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> but the King being alone they poſtponed it, their View being to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both or neither. Theſe and the like Diſappointments put it into the Head of one of the melancholy Conſpirators, That God to uſe his own Phraſe, was againſt them, which wrought on him to diſcloſe the whole Affair, and he accordingly did. Upon this, many of the Conſpirators, and Abettors withdrew; the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> fled, Lord <hi>Grey</hi> made his Eſcape after he had been taken, but Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> was apprehended and committed to the Tower, together with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eskrick,</hi> Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and many others; and Orders were ſent down, to us in the North, to keep a watchful Eye, and a ready Hand over all ſuſpicious Perſons, and particularly to look out for one Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Nelthorp,</hi> who were ſuppoſed to have made their way towards us. By ſome Scotchmen we intercepted and examined, we underſtood this Conſpiracy to have been general with the Fanatics and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0170800300:168"/>
Diſcontented in both Kingdoms, and that  the Correſpondence was carried on, between them, by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Pedlars, and other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries in diſguiſe, which cauſed great Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny and Search to be made and obſerved with Regard to all ſuch People from the North: But to dwell on the Particulars of this Plot, and the Proofs made, out againſt thoſe who ſuffered for it, were needleſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what has been ſaid and recorded by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both privately and publickly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; ſo I ſhall only ſay, that in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion it proved fatal to Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> the eldeſt Son and Heir to the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and others of more inferior Note.</p>

But at length it was relieved by the fortunate Valour of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> aſſiſted principally by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0170800300:169"/>
 the Emperor's General, and partly by the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Bavaria:</hi> But the bare mention of this being as much as can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at my Hands, I ſhall return to the Poſture and Current of our own Affairs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October,</hi> I had a Letter from my Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> to acquaint me that I had the King's Leave to come to Town, which I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, as thinking it to be neceſſary I ſhould be near the King's Perſon, at a Time when I thought he would be taking of new Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and making of new Regulations, with Regard to Affairs in general, and Officersin particular, for his own and the Nation's greater Security after the late horrid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations: accordingly I ſat out the latter End of this Month for <hi>London,</hi> where I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I went to viſit my Lord Privy Seal, and found him ſtill rooted in the King's good Eſteem; but that the Duke was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo grateful to him as he ought to have been. I found alſo that the Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Lordſhip and Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> not only ſubſiſted ſtill, but with more Acrimony and Warmth than before; and underſtood that the Lord Mayor of <hi>York</hi> was ſent for up, by an Order of Council, on account of ſome Words he had ſpoken. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0170800300:170"/>
me very graciouſly, and the Duke  ſeemed kind to me, nor did my Lord <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> whom I viſited, ſcruple to favour me with a decent Reception.</p>
            <p>But I found the Hopes of a Parliament to be ſtill at a very great Diſtance, tho' <hi>Flanders</hi> was in Danger of falling next Spring under the Yoke of <hi>France,</hi> and tho' the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was much diſſatisfied at the tedious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, that Part of the Nation, I mean, that was in Oppoſition to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt. And juſt now it hapned that the Grand Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of <hi>France</hi> being in <hi>England,</hi> and obſerved to be very fond of the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and ſhe of him, the King conceived ſo great a Jealouſy thereat he ſent him away; and it was ſhrewdly ſuſpected the Ducheſs would not be long behind him, which few People ſeemed to be very ſorry for.</p>
            <p>I had heard, from a great Man, that ſomething would ſhortly happen very much to the Mortification of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and his Party, a Myſtery which ſeemed in a few Days afterwards to be explained. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> being ſuſpected to have taken Refuge ſomewhere abroad, on account of the Conſpiracy, ſurrenders himſelf to Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Jenkins,</hi> at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where the Thing being before concerted, the King and Duke
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0170800300:171"/>
 went to him, and, after an Hour's Diſcourſe, ſuffered him to go to his Lodgings at the Cockpit, attended by his own Servants, and under no other Reſtraint than that of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Arms; but what was ſaid or done at this Interview, may be conjectured ſooner than known.</p>
            <p>This was matter of Surpriſe to all People, and waiting on Lord Privy Seal, he told me, He doubted not but the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s Affair, his Grace having that Day kiſſed the King's Hand, the Duke's and the Queen's, would be the Subject of great Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and that various Gueſſes would be made as to the Interceſſion that brought it to paſs. I told him the World ſaid the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> had done it, and that it was publickly known That the King had the Day before in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſaid, It was at the Requeſt of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to whom his Grace had made Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and diſclaimed all Competition with for the Crown. His Lordſhip anſwered, that the Thing was far from ſo, for that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and thoſe in his Intereſt, had oppoſed it to the very laſt; and thereupon owned himſelf to have been chiefly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental therein; and gave me ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons both public and private, tho' not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0170800300:172"/>
to be here enumerated, why he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed  to that End. By this it plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, That notwithſtanding the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Strength of the Intereſt combined againſt him, this noble Lord had great Power with his Majeſty. His Lordſhip moreover gave me to underſtand that his Grace had made Confeſſion of the late Plot, but would not give any public Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Conſpirators. But to diſmiſs this, certain it is that whoever wrought ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly, with the King, in favour of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> his Majeſty himſelf may be ſaid to have had a large Share therein.

 who were before his Friends. That, not many Hours before, the Duke had told him, That if the Lord Privy Seal had had no Friendſhip for him in any other Capacity, yet as being the King's Brother, he might have let him into the Secret, and not have brought in <hi>Monmouth</hi> quite without his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: That indeed he never could forget what the Lord Privy Seal had formerly done to ſerve him; but that he took a Way, if poſſible, to make him forget it; and that to his Knowledge, his Lordſhip was ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting his Labours to reunite the King and <hi>Monmouth.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That his Highneſs knew his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord Privy Seal, but that the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Reſpect he bore to his Highneſs was more conſidered by him than all that, and that he hoped his Lordſhip deſigned him no Diſſervice in this Affair, with much more to the ſame Purpoſe; in ſhort, his Grace ſeemed much to lament what his Lordſhip had done in Favor of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> His Grace added, That if the Privy Seal would but truſt him, he would tell him how to be too hard for <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> without recurring to ſuch unpopular Methods.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Jan. 2.</label> I communicated the Particulars of this Converſation to his Lordſhip, who anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0170800300:178"/>
That he thereby perceived the Duke had  a Mind to be upon better Meaſures with him; but that, abſolutely, he had not ſeen the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſince he laſt left the Court; that as to what he had done for his Grace, it was purely in Obedience to the King's Commands; and that as the King would not allow him, it was impoſſible for him to have diſcloſed the Matter to his Highneſs; and concluded, that he was to dine with the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> following, and ſhould the better know what to ſay to his Grace, if he touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Affair, ſince I had taken Care to apprize him of his Thoughts.</p>
            <p>I learnt from a great Man, that we were in no Way of having a Parliament, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome near the King, who adviſed him to another Way of ruling the Kingdom. The ſame Gentleman, at the ſame time, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, That now the Fanatics had nothing elſe to ſay againſt the Government, they muſt have ſufficient Cauſe of Complaint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account, as well as on Account of ſeveral other Points now in Agitation. Some Days afterwards, my Lord Privy Seal told me, He had been very earneſt with the King to call a Parliament, and had repreſented to him, That tho' he had ſlipped the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0170800300:179"/>
 of calling one immediately after the late Plot, when he could not poſſibly have failed of one according to his Mind, and might fear he ſhould meet with no good one now, he would do well to conſider, that the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he deferred the Thing, the worſe it would be, and indeed ſo very bad, That it might be uſed as an Argument never to call one more. That nothing ought to have that Weight with him, as his Word given to the People; that the Law required a Parliament to be called every three Year; and that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the laſt Diſſolution, his Majeſty had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a religious Obſervance of the Laws, by a Proclamation ſetting forth his Reaſons for diſmiſſing that Parliament: That the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſtruction put upon this was, that he intended to call another within the three Years, and that he feared an ill Uſe might be made of his not doing what it was ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppoſed he certainly would: That tho' the Antimonarchiſts were now at a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low Ebb, and under great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch his Majeſty's procedure might raiſe a Spirit of Diſcontent where it was leaſt expected, meaning among thoſe, who tho' they were Friends to the Crown, were, at the ſame time, deſirous he ſhould govern according to Law, and not only deſired, but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0170800300:180"/>
expected it, ſince he had given his Royal  Word, that he would do ſo: That if, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his Majeſty thought not well of this, he would be nevertheleſs ſo far from relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing his Service, that he would make it his Study to find out Excuſes to make him eaſy with the People. So then there was no poſſibility of ſeeing a Parliament aſſembled, but by ſome Compulſion from a foreign Cauſe, and no Body could tell, but that if the War went on, the Confederates might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to declare againſt us.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Affairs were now chiefly under the Management of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who carried every Thing with a very lofty hand; but, what is very ſtrange, the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> was on the Point of ſtepping out of the Tower, tho' againſt his Highneſs's Conſent. My Lord Privy Seal aſſured me his Enlargement was at hand; that he himſelf had been his Lordſhip's chief Friend, and that the King had made both the Duke and Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet their Hands to it. The Duke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, appeared to be hearty in it, and that the King was ſo, there could be no doubt; but <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Sunderland</hi> did underhand oppoſe it with might and main, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived that the Judges delayed to bail out his Lordſhip 'till the very laſt Day of the Term; thoſe two Lords dreading, That
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0170800300:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Danby</hi> might join with <hi>Hallifax</hi> to weaken <label type="milestone">

            <p>And now it was reſolved to bring a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> if with any Colour of Juſtice it could be done, againſt the Charter of <hi>York;</hi> and two Days afterwards, Lord <hi>Danby</hi> was bailed out of his long Confinement of five Years, as were all the Popiſh Lords that had been under Durance ever ſince the Time of the firſt Plot. Lord <hi>Danby</hi> came the ſame Day to kiſs his Majeſty's Hand in the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, where I hapned to be preſent. The King received him very kindly, and when the Earl complained of his long Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, his Majeſty told him, he knew it was againſt his Conſent, which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thankfully acknowledged; but they had no Manner of private Diſcourſe together. My Lord Privy Seal came into the Preſence preſently after, and the two Lords ſaluted each other; but it was very ſlightly done on both Sides, The next Day, however, I went from the Lord Privy Seal, to wait upon the Earl, when his Lordſhip deſired me to preſent his Service to him, and to tell him, That he ſhould have taken a more particular Sort of Notice of him, but that he thought it would not prove ſo much for his Service: And the Earl ſaid, It was for the very ſelf ſame Reaſon he had behaved
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0170800300:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo indifferently towards his Lordſhip; for  there was at that Time great Jealouſy of a Friendſhip between them. Lord <hi>Danby</hi> told me, he would retire to his Houſe out of Town, nor concern himſelf with Buſineſs, tho' he doubted not but he might if he would, but not upon the national Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he deſired, and therefore would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with it, declaring his Averſion to a <hi>French</hi> or a Popiſh Intereſt. He told me alſo, the Subſtance of what had paſſed between the Duke and him, at the Viſit he made to his Highneſs, after he had been with the King, and I thereby underſtood his Lordſhip was upon no very affectionate Terms with that Prince. He ſaid his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs told him, he had heard he had ſpoken ſlightingly of him, and that he anſwered, It was true he had often been ſo unfortunate as to differ with him in Opinion, and could not help ſaying, That he had never yet found any Cauſe to repent him of it; but that for expreſſing himſelf any how againſt his Perſon, if he heard ſo, they were Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Lies; and deſired to know who were his Informers; but the Duke evaded that. In ſhort, I found by my Lord Privy Seal, That he and the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> had a good Underſtanding together.</p>

The Manner of the King's dividing his Time at this Place was thus: He walked in the Morning 'till ten of the Clock; then he went to the Cockpit 'till Dinner-time; about three he went to the Horſe-races; at ſix he returned to the Cockpit, for an Hour only; then he went to the Play, tho' the Actors were but of a terrible Sort; from thence to Supper; then to the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi>'s 'till Bed-time; and ſo to his own Apartment to take his Reſt.</p>

            <p>I returned to the North, and the <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, we had the grateful News that <hi>Buda</hi> had been taken for the Emperor, by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> as alſo, that a Truce was made between the Emperor and the King of <hi>France,</hi> which looked as if a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Peace was at Hand, that the Chriſtian Powers might the better exert themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſumptuous Arms of the Infidel.

Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> had been removed from the  Head of the Treaſury Board, to that of the Council; in which, tho' he was advanced in Honour, he was put backward in Profit and Power: It was therefore moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he never ſought for, and as plain, that Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> had brought it to paſs: Thus it was that Lord <hi>Danby,</hi> now in the Country, conjectured; and it was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me, by a Letter from my Lord <hi>Marquiſs</hi> himſelf, wherein he made Uſe of theſe Words; <hi>You may believe I am not at all diſpleaſed to ſee ſuch an Adverſary removed from the only Place that could give him Power and Advantage; and he bears it with ſo little Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, that, if I had ill Nature enough, he gives me ſufficient Occaſion to triumph.

But in contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this, I, towards the latter End of this ſame Month, received a very kind Letter from my Lord Marquiſs, and others from very great Perſons, which gave me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, There would probably be ſome farther Change at Court, that his Lordſhip ſtood very firm with the King, and that it was believed the Power of the <hi>French</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt was ſomewhat abated.</p>

At this we doubled our Diligence to ſecure Peace and Quietneſs, and to prevent any Obſtacle that might ſtart up in Prejudice to the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> Two Days afterwards came News <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Feb. 7.</label> that my great and good Maſter was depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Life.

A ſtrange Effect of Power it was from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven  it ſelf, That ſo ſtrong a Party as had reared its Head in Parliament, and ſo pertinaciouſly called out for the excluſion of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> ſhould now upon his Acceſſion acquieſce to him, with ſuch Deference and quiet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. But it may be preſumed, they were aware of the Difference there was between the Spirit of the late and the preſent King: The former they thought might, for Peace ſake, be ſooner brought to abandon his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the latter tamely to renounce his Right and Title to three Kingdoms, for fear of a War. But what ſerved in very great Meaſure to quiet the Minds and allay the Paſſions of Men, was King <hi>James</hi>'s Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Privy Council immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Breath was out of his Brother's Body, Whereby he promiſed to defend the Government of <hi>England,</hi> both in Church and State, and carefully to tread in the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of his late Majeſty, with regard to his Kindneſs and Lenity towards his People; and that as on the one Hand, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the juſt Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, ſo on the other, he would invade no Man's Property.</p>
            <p>I ſtayed at <hi>York</hi> a few Days to keep the Peace, and, in the mean time, had Notice
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0170800300:193"/>
 from the proper Hands, that I was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Command, and that I had leave to ſet out for <hi>London,</hi> as I, indeed had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Feb. 16.</label> But now there began to be great Changes at Court; Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was made Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England;</hi> Lord Privy Seal was made Lord Preſident of the Council; which tho' it was a Step higher as to Place, it was much doubted that it was not at his Lordſhip's Deſire; the Truſt and Profit of the Privy Seal being judged to be an overbalance for the Honour of the other. And now we had the agreeable Proſpect of of a Parliament, which it was ſaid his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty intended ſhould meet in <hi>May</hi> next.</p>
            <p>It was now beyond all Doubt that the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>April 13.</label> King was a Papiſt; for he went publickly to Maſs, tho' he ordered the Chappel of <hi>Whitehall</hi> to be kept in <hi>Statu quo;</hi> whither the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark</hi> repaired daily, while the King did the ſame to the Queen's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chappel. In the Interim, I was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a Member to ſit in the enſuing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the City of <hi>York;</hi> and with this new Charge, I this Day ſat forward for <hi>London;</hi> where being arrived, my Lord Marquiſs of <hi>Hallifax</hi> told me he and Lord <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> the Treaſurer, were now very well together; that he had uſed his conſtant
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0170800300:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Endeavours to ſerve the King, and that he  would continue to do the ſame; but that he hoped his Majeſty would not think of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his Religion on him; which he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſorrowfully to apprehend, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Poſts in the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> being now put into the Hands of Papiſts. His Lordſhip then recalled to me ſeveral Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the late King's Kindneſs to him, and certainly no Man was deeper in his Favour, when his Majeſty was unfortunately ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, than my Lord Marquiſs. A few <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>April 22.</label> Days afterwards, I waited on his Majeſty, kiſſed his Hand, and at the ſame time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with an Addreſs from the young Men of the City of <hi>York,</hi> who had petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for leave to exerciſe themſelves at Arms on certain Days of the Year, which the King received very kindly.</p>
            <p>The next Day my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> told me he had had two private Audiences of the King, and that he had in ſuch plain Terms told him his Mind, upon the grand Point of Government, that he much wondered the King, conſidering his natural Temper, took it with that Calmneſs and Compoſure he did. His Lordſhip then obſerved, It poſſibly might be inſiſted on, that ſome Acts ſhould, in the enſuing Parliament, be repealed, which
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0170800300:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 would require a weighty and mature Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration; and touched on ſome Things not altogether ſo fit to be inſerted in this Place.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>April 23.</label> The King was crowned and the Queen in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> with all imaginable Pomp and magnificence, except that there was no Cavalcade thorough the City, as the Cuſtom had formerly been.</p>
            <p>Their Majeſties went privately to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where they, the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and all the Officers of the Crown put on their Robes, Formalities, and Enſigns, and thence proceeded thorough <hi>Palace-yard,</hi> rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and prepared for that Purpoſe, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> whence the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony being compleated, they all returned to the Hall, to a moſt ſumptuous Dinner. And now the Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons began to conſider what the Court might demand of them, as well as what might be granted at the approaching Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Parliament conſiſting of a great Number of Loyal Gentlemen, who were nevertheleſs, good Patriots, and true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. The Report went, that there would be more required in Behalf of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than the Laws now in Force would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of; and that the King expected the Settlement of a conſtant Revenue upon him,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0170800300:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuitable to that of the late King, beſides a  Sum of ready Money to ſubvene his preſeut Occaſions. That in favour of Popery it would be propoſed to repeal the <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> Act, which I found was much oppoſed by ſome great ones, in their private Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as well as by ſome of us; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a general Toleration or Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which ſome ſeemed willing enough to ſubſcribe to; tho' at the ſame time, the Reſolution was to admit of no Alteration to capacitate Papiſts to enjoy any Place or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in or under the Government. As for the Affair of Money, Men in general ſeemed willing to ſettle an handſome Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue upon the King, and to give him Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but whether their Grant ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent or only temporary, and to be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from time to time by Parliament, that the Nation might be the oftner conſulted, was the Queſtion: In all this, I reſolved punctually to do my Duty to the Crown, but not to be unmindful of a due Regard for my Country, and my Religion.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

 Papiſts ſhould be allowed the private exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, and that they, at leaſt ſuch as had ſerved the Royal Family in the Wars or otherwiſe ſhould be capable of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment under him: That the King would, in Parliament, give full Satisfaction to the Nation, with regard to their Religion and Properties; but that if Reaſon would not ſerve his Purpoſe, he knew what he had to do. That the King would never divide the regal Power by admitting of that of the Pope; that his Majeſty was too fond of Power to be guilty of that Overſight; and that his adhering to the Defence of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> would on the other Hand, deter the Pope from preſſing him to admit of his Supremacy; in ſhort, That it was but reaſonable the King ſhould inſiſt on the Repeal of the ſeverer penal Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts; for that if he ſhould die, he would leave them in as ill a plight as he found them: But what Wiſdom or Senſe there was in thoſe who, at this time, could offer at ſuch Arguments, need not be ſaid.</p>
            <p>I waited on the King in his Barge from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> where he went to viſit the Queen Dowager: It was upon this Day, that the noted Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> was convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of Perjury, it being proved, that he was at

St. <hi>Omers</hi> the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> 1678, when he  ſwore he was at the <hi>White-horſe</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where <hi>Pickering, Groves, Ireland,</hi> and other Jeſuits ſigned the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: This was a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearing to the King, who thereupon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That, indeed, there had been a Meeting of the Jeſuits that Day, and that all the Scholars of St. <hi>Omers</hi> knew of it, but that it was well Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> knew no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where it was to be; for, ſays his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, they met in St. <hi>James</hi>'s where I then lived, which if <hi>Oates</hi> had but known, he would have cut out a fine Spot of Work for me. The King then ſubjoined, That <hi>Oates</hi> being thus convicted, the Popiſh Plot was now dead; to which I anſwering, That it had been long ſince dead, and that now it would be buried; his Majeſty ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Turn, that going with him afterwards to the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s, I heard him repeat it to her.</p>
            <p>Three or four Days afterwards, we had Advice, That a Store of Arms had been bought up in <hi>Holland,</hi> and conveyed into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and ſome ſaid the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> were actually gone with them, or after them.</p>

On the twenty ſecond, the King made a Speech to both Houſes, and therein aſſured them, he would ſupport and defend the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers had ever been moſt Loyal in the worſt of Times, in the Cauſe of his Father, and the Support of his Brother; as alſo to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Government both in Church and State, as by Law eſtabliſhed; and that as he never would depart from the juſt Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, ſo neither would he attempt to invade any Man's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. He deſired of us ſuitable Returns in ſettling the Revenue on him for Life, as in the Days of the late King; and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an Account he had received from <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> was landed with Men and Arms, on the Weſtern Iſlands of that Kingdom; and that the ſaid Lord had publiſhed two Declarations, in both of which he charged him with Tyranny and Uſurpation.</p>

The Commons returning to their Houſe,  immediately voted, That the King's Speech ſhould be taken into ſpeedy Conſideration, and were ſo well pleaſed with the ſolemn Security the King had given them as to their Religion and Property, That they voted him the very ſame Revenue for his Life, as had been enjoyed by the late King for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And now all Things ſeemed to ſmile with a very auſpicious Countenance, the King forbearing the leaſt Advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Change of Religion, and ſeeming to be bent quite the contrary Way.</p>

This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration charged <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> for ſo it ſtiled the King, with the Burning of the City, the Death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> the Murder of <hi>Sidney,</hi> and Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> with the Poiſoning of the late King, and tearing his Crown from his Head: It charged him alſo with being a Slave to Popiſh Councils, and with packing the preſent Parliament; and that therefore he was come to revenge all theſe Things on the pretended King; that he would never hearken to any Terms, or Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 'till his Work was compleated, and that as he was reſolved to give no Quarter to thoſe that oppoſed him, he exhorted all good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to come in and aſſiſt him. To this he ſubjoined, that he had a juſt Title to the Crown, but that he would lay no Claim to it 'till he had called a free Parliament, to whom he was ready to give full Satisfaction as to that Matter; that Parliaments ſhould
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0170800300:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſit every Year, nor he diſmiſſed 'till all  Grievances were redreſſed, and that he would grant Liberty of Conſcience to all Manner of People, not excluding even the Papiſts, and much more in the ſame Strain.</p>
            <p>Mean while, came News that <hi>Monmouth</hi> having marched out of the Town of <hi>Lyme</hi> with 200 Foot, and 100 Horſe, had met with ſome of the <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> Militia, fallen on them, killed ſeveral Perſons of Note, and taken ſome Priſoners. And now an additional Supply is voted, for defraying the Expence of the War, againſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> The Houſe upon this Occaſion reſolved it ſelf into a Committee of the whole, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the Ways and Means for raiſing this new Supply, voted That it ſhonld be levied upon ſuch new Foundations, as had been built upon within the Compaſs of the Bills of Mortality, ſince the Year 1660, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late general Fires in the City of <hi>London</hi> and Borough of <hi>Southwark. Secondly,</hi> That it ſhould be levyed only upon the Rents of the ſame Houſes for the Term of one Year, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Upon ſuch Foundations as were now laid. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That there ſhould be a Clauſe to prevent any more Buildings within the ſaid Limits. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the Houſe ſhould be moved that a Bill
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0170800300:207"/>
 might be brought in for that Intent; in all which the Houſe concurred with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>June 18.</label> The next Day the King ſent to us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire we would give him Credit upon ſome Fund, for ſuch a Sum as we ſhould think fit to grant him, towards the Suppreſſion of the Rebellion in the Weſt; and that we would prepare our Buſineſs ſo as to be in a Condition to adjourn for ſome time, within a few Days. Upon this we reſolved again into a Committee of the whole Houſe, and voted him the Sum of 400,000 <hi>l.</hi> the Sum agreed on the Day before; and at the ſame Time appointed a Committee to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and bring in an Eſtimate of the yearly Value of the Rents of the new Buildings upon new Foundations.</p>

            <p>But I cannot help obſerving, that my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> took it ill of me, That I had been ſo earneſt for the taxing of the new Buildings, he having a deep Concern there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but I told him it was my Judgment, and that if my Father's Intereſt had been ever ſo much therein, I ſhould have done the ſame Thing; that however, I was very ſorry He, above all Men in the World, ſhould diſapprove of any Thing I did; but we prefently underſtood each other, and he ſaid he was very ſorry he had ſaid any Thing to diſturb me: This, tho' a Tranſaction of quite a private Nature, I could not forbear the mention of, as it was the only Time we ever ſo much as ſeemed to differ; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Matters of more general Importance.</p>

               <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of his Forces in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, having Notice, that the Rebels had paſſed the River above <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> had marched from <hi>Glaſgow</hi> to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them near the Cloſe of the Day, but that in the Night the Rebels ſtole away from him into <hi>Renfrew;</hi> that the ſaid Earl then purſued them with his Horſe and Dragoons, and underſtood that they were making away from him in very great Confuſion; that the ſame Day three Servants belonging to a Gentleman of <hi>Renfrew,</hi> fell upon the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> as he was getting away in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of a Countryman, with a blue Bonnet on his Head; and that they had wounded him in ſeveral Places of the Head; till at laſt, fearing they would kill him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf to be the Earl of <hi>Argyle;</hi> and that thereupon they had taken him Priſoner, and conducted him to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> where he was committed. The King ſent an Account of all this to the Commons, who returned their Thanks for the ſame, by ſuch of their Members as were of the Privy Council, who came back with this Anſwer, That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was every Day more and more ſatisfied with them for their Zeal and Loyalty to

            <p>The next Day I hapned to dine with Sir <label type="milestone">

               <hi>James Smith,</hi> the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> whom I had formerly known intimately well, and who was of a very Loyal Club in the City, where I uſed to go, while the Fanatic Plot was in agitation. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman complained to me, That he enjoyed no more than the bare Title of Lord Mayor, the Lord chief Juſtice <hi>Jefferies</hi> uſurping the Power; that the City had no Sort of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the King, but by the Intervention of that Lord; that whatever was well done in the City, was attributed to his Influence and Management; and that himſelf and the Aldermen were by the Court looked upon no better than his Tools: That upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0170800300:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 his Lordſhip was ſo forgetful of the high Dignity of the City as to uſe him and his Brethren with Contempt; in fine, that the Lord Chief Juſtice was to be pitied; that his Haughtineſs would be the ruin of him; and that he actually intended to let the King into the Myſtery of theſe Things; but that he thought the preſent Time was not altogether ſo proper, ſeeing a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of this Tendency might be conſtrued into Mutiny and Diſaffection. I anſwered, That the King was too well acquainted with the Lord Mayor's Services and Integrity to ſuſpect him of that, and that, in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, now was the fitteſt Time for expoſing a Man in that Credit at Court; for that now the greateſt Notice would be taken of all ſuch Grievances. Indeed I was ſorry at my Heart to ſee ſuch good Men diſſatisfied in any Degree; but I was as glad to find this proud Man ſeen through; for he had to my Knowledge uſed the City of <hi>York</hi> as ſcurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it was poſſible for him to uſe the City of <hi>London.</hi> For at <hi>York</hi> he put out five Aldermen tho' he had ſolemnly engaged to keep them in, and that, without ſo much as allowing them to be heard as to the Crimes they ſtood accuſed of.

In ſhort, I was at the very ſame Time told by one of the Lieutenancy of the City, That ſhould the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> give a Blow to the King's Forces, it was much to be feared there would be an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in <hi>London.</hi>

And now the Fears of thoſe who were Friends to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, added to the Hopes of thoſe who were averſe to it. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Army was ſwelled to a Body of 12000 Foot, and 1500 Horſe, which moved from Place to Place, in the hilly and incloſed Country of the Weſt, where tho' the King's Army kept pretty cloſe in with them; they could not offer to give Battle. The King's Army, that was neareſt to <hi>Monmouth,</hi> was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and did not conſiſt of above 3000 Foot, and five hundred Horſe, but then they were moſtly of the Guards. In a Day or two the King had Advice, that <hi>Monmouth</hi> had got into <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> that he

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>July 6.</label> The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> being then inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> lay incamped at not above three Miles from <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> that his Army was as yet but ſmall, that he was in Expectation of being reinforced by three <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and three <hi>Scotch</hi> Regiments from <hi>Holland,</hi> and that a Body of Horſe was on its March from <hi>London</hi> to the ſame Purpoſe; he ſteals out about one in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with his whole Army, and moves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Royal Camp, and that with ſuch Silence and good Order, That the King's People knew nothing of the Approach 'till alarmed by the Fire of one of their out Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> marched at the Head of the Foot, and Lord <hi>Grey</hi> led up the Horſe, and they brought their Cannon to play within Piſtol-ſhot. On the other Hand, our People got into Order as faſt, and received them as well as could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but were ſo overpowered by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that 'till Lord <hi>Grey</hi> went off with the Horſe, which were frightned at the Cannon, we were in very imminent Danger of loſing the Day: But for the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> he ſtood 'till a great Part of his Foot was cut
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0170800300:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Pieces, and then made off; but ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly  that his Coat, his Papers, and his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary were taken. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presbyterian Prieſt and Rebel, and Lord <hi>Grey</hi> was taken in Diſguiſe, three Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had, from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beginning of this deſperate Attempt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with the Conduct of a great Captain, as was allowed even by the King, who, in my Hearing, ſaid he had not made one falſe Step. And thus was this great Storm, which gathered from a ſmall Cloud, the Number that landed with the Duke not exceeding 150, thus I ſay, was this great Storm for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately not to ſay ſurpriſingly allayed. Had <hi>Monmouth</hi> obtained a Victory, it was much to be feared, that the Diſaffected would have riſen in ſuch Numbers, in the ſeveral Parts of <hi>England,</hi> as to have made the Crown <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>July 9.</label> precarious. But to complete the King's good Fortune, came News, that the Duke himſelf had been taken in Diſguiſe in a Wood, by a Parcel of Country Fellows who were in queſt of him, together with one Count <hi>Horn,</hi> who being firſt diſcovered in a Buſh, told them the Duke himſelf was not far off; and the ſame Day the Ducheſs of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and her two Sons were ſent to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0170800300:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 the Tower. The Duke, when he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, was almoſt ſpent, not having been in a Bed for three Weeks; he was quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided with Arms, nor made any Defence, being deſtitute of every thing but a Watch he had in his Pocket, and about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds in Gold, which was all the Money he had left. His Majeſty, and no wonder, was extremely well pleaſed at this News; but he was of a Temper ſo very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, that he never appeared tranſported upon any Occaſion; and ſurely he never could have a greater Reaſon for it than now, that he ſaw the Rebellion plucked up by the very Roots, and himſelf firmer ſeated on the Throne, by the Endeavours that had been uſed to ſhake him out of it.</p>
            <p>When his Grace came to Town, the King, at his own Requeſt, ſaw him at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where he expreſſed ſome Deteſtation of his Attempt; threw the Blame on the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> who had ſtirred him up to it; diſclaiming all Title to the Crown, and ſaid he was put upon aſſuming the Stile of King, with a View that the Quality would the ſooner come in to him; all this I heard the King ſay, but what he farther confeſſed, was not then known. He concluded with a Deſire of Pardon, and, on his Knees,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0170800300:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
begged his Life of the King; and for the  ſame, he, by Letters, ſollicited the two Queens, 'till his Head was at five Blows ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his Body, on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi> When he came to ſuffer, he ſubmitted with great Unconcern, renounced all Pretence to the Crown, and unkindly, to ſay no worſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned his Ducheſs, who to him, who had nothing of his own, had brought a Fortune of ten thouſand Pounds a Year; ſaying ſhe was given to him as his Wife in the Days of his Minority, but that the Wife of his own Choice, was the Lady <hi>Henrietta Wentworth,</hi> the only Daughter and Heireſs of the Earl of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> whom he had debauched; with whom he confeſſed he had lived according to the Rules of his own Convenience, tho' not according to the Laws of the Land, for two Years paſt. He then ſaid he was ſorry for the Effuſion of Blood he had cauſed, but, throughout his whole Diſcourſe, made no mention of a Rebellion; and out of his Pocket were taken Books, in his own hand Writing, containing Charms or Spells to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Doors of a Priſon, to obviate the Danger of being wounded in Battle, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Songs and Prayers; ſuch was the latter End of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>

            <p>Towards the Cloſe of this Month, I

but the Commons being moved to the ſame,  made Head againſt it, as we have hinted. The King in this Speech told the Houſes He was glad to meet them in better Times than when he parted with them; that the Rebellion was now perfectly quaſhed; but that, however, the Government might be in like Manner attempted for the future, it being experienced, that the Militia of the Kingdom was of no Uſe; that therefore as the ſtanding Force was but ſmall, he had raiſed it to a conſiderable Number, which would be an additional Charge upon him, for the Time to come; that, in conſideration thereof, he deſired a proportionable Aid: That it was true There were ſome popiſh Officers in this Army, but that he hoped it would make no Difference between him and his Parliament; for that tho' they were not qualified by Law, they were ſuch as had ſhewn their Principles by their Loyalty; and that having had Experience of this, he would not expoſe them to Shame by parting with them, or to that Effect; and that, in fine, he would venture his Life for the true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Nation.</p>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0170800300:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 the <hi>Quantum,</hi> nor the particular Uſe it was deſigned for. Upon this a long Debate aroſe, and the Queſtion being put, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, the No's being 250, and the Ay's 125. They afterwards, the ſame Day, came to a Diviſion upon the Queſtion, Whether that Houſe ſhould firſt proceed upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the King, or upon the ſecond Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of his Majeſty's Speech, concerning the popiſh Officers in the Army; and it was carryed for poſtponing the Supply, by one Voice only; in which Diviſion, the King was told That ſeveral of his Servants, and Officers of the Army, that were of the Houſe, were againſt him. The next Day I waited on the King to kiſs his Hand, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Nov. 14.</label> he asked me when I came to Town? I told him, the night before: He ſaid, He was ſorry I had not been here ſooner, for that if I had, he ſhould not have loſt the Day before, for one ſingle Vote, which he ſaid was hard, and the more ſo becauſe it was owing to his own Officers; which I took to be an oblique Piece of Admonition to me. This ſame Day, The ſecond Part of the King's Speech was taken into Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Reſult was, That an Addreſs ſhould be drawn up and preſented to his Majeſty, to repreſent to him, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0170800300:220"/>
of Popiſh Recuſants into the Army  was quite contrary to Law, and to deſire that they might be removed from their Poſts. A Committee was appointed for this Purpoſe, and likewiſe to frame a Bill for the indemnifying the ſaid Officers, in Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they had entered into the Service at a Time of ſuch imminent Danger. Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Day on Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> he told me the Particulars of his Diſmiſſion: He ſaid he might have continued with greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanges than ever, if he could but in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have concurred in ſome Things which he ſaw in Embryo; that the King parted with him with ſeeming Kindneſs, but would aſſign no Cauſe for it, and that he would name no Body into his Place. This Lord being generally eſteemed a wiſe Man, and an excellent Subject, the Removal of him, eſpecially in almoſt the Infancy of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was Matter of Aſtoniſhment to great Numbers, and injected a Fear, That a Change of Councils was in conſequence to enſue a Change of Councellors.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Nov. 19.</label> Now the Debate, concerning the Aid to be granted to his Majeſty came on. The Motion was at firſt for two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, and then four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds on the Part of the Country;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0170800300:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 while thoſe of the Court inſiſted on twelve hundred thouſand Pounds, for the Payment of the new raiſed Forces, for a Term of five Years to come. But the Houſe would give no Ear to ſuch an Application of the Money they might give, leſt it ſhould prove a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the Support of a ſtanding Army; they rather choſe to give it to the King to do with it as he would; and at length ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred thouſand Pounds was propoſed, and granted. In the Courſe of this Debate, the Uſefulneſs of a ſtanding Army, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally 'till the Ferment of the Rebellion was quite ſettled, was much inſiſted on by the one Side, while the other expoſed the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it, the Infolency of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Addreſs againſt popiſh Officers being prepared, was this Day read, and agreed to; but a Debate aroſe, Whether the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Lords ſhould be deſired or not: The Courtiers were againſt it, that the King

            <p>I, for my Part, had ſeen ſo many Changes backwards and forwards, ſo many of both great and ſmall removed and ſhifted about, that I muſt confeſs the Thoughts thereof began to damp the Flight of my Ambition; and made me conclude, There was a Time
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0170800300:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 when every ſober Man would chuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and be content with what he had, rather than venture his Subſtance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience upon the uncertain Hazard of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his Wealth; not that I found the King any way altered with regard to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or that I deſpaired of keeping my Ground, tho' my great and good Friend was out; on the contrary, could I but have ſtrained to the Pitch ſome did, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded I had a fairer Opportunity of raiſing my ſelf than ever I had; but I preferred a certain Safety to an uncertain Grandeur.</p>
            <p>But Things now, with regard to thoſe who enjoyed any Poſts under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeemed to be carried to a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Length; for <hi>Fox,</hi> the Paymaſter of the Army, whoſe Employ was valued at ten thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and Colonel <hi>John Darcy,</hi> Grandchild and Heir to the Earl of <hi>Holderneſs,</hi> having offended the King by their Votes in the lower Houſe, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been thereupon forbidden the King's Preſence, were now wholly laid aſide; and it was now ſaid that in Council it had been agreed, That all Perſons, who for the future, offended in the ſame Way, would be ſerved in the ſame Manner, which ſtartled a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People. And now it was obſerved,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0170800300:228"/>
that the Lord Treaſurer was more lowly and  obliging than uſual, whence it was conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured that the Odds were againſt him, and as much was confeſſed by ſome even of his his Friends; his Lordſhip now ſetting up for the Proteſtant Intereſt, and the Queen and her Friends for the Popiſh.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Gentlemen I have already nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there were ſeveral other Members diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from their Imployments, for not vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the King expected they ſhould, and particularly ſuch as were Officers in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who being not only ſo, but alſo great and very eminent for their Families and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the Crown, it was Matter of great wonder to every Body. But what ſurpriſed me as much as any Thing was to hear, from the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> That Lord Marquiſs of <hi>Hallifax</hi> was coming again into play; an agreeable Surpriſe this, eſpecially as the Times ſeemed to turn; but the very next Day, I had the Mortification to underſtand, from the Marquiſs's own Mouth, that there was no manner of Foundation for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> now told me ſeveral Things concerning the State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which aſtoniſhed me very much, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were now in a moſt unprecedented Manner aſſaulted in the very Streets; one
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0170800300:229"/>
 had a Powder thrown into his Eyes, which deprived him of Sight; another had his Throat cut by two Men, tho' neither of theſe Gentlemen had given the leaſt viſible Provocation or Offence to the Aggreſſors; and the Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> was met by a Gentleman who threatned him as his Grace was going along in his Chair. And now it was whiſpered, That the King would ſtill farther prorogue the Parliament 'till <hi>May;</hi> which certainly was the wiſeſt Courſe he had, at this Time, to take, if he could not reſolve to give ſome proper Satisfaction to the Houſes, with regard to the popiſh Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; but that this was far from his Thoughts, and quite contrary to his Intention, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a late Admiſſion of ſeveral others of that Superſtition into Military Poſts. In ſhort the King unhappily perſiſting in his own Way, diſcharged his Anger againſt the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> a moſt worthy Prelate, Brother to the late Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> putting him away from the Council Board, on account of a Speech he had, the laſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, made in the Houſe of Lords, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the popiſt Officers; tho' as I was told, by the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> it was ſpoken with all the Deference and Reſpect imaginable.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0170800300:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 What the other Witneſſes had to alledge, was all Circumſtance and Hearſay: Some ſaid the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had told them, He depended upon Help from Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> and Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> and that they would be ready to riſe in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> as ſoon as he landed: Others ſwore that the Duke had written and ſent Meſſages to his Friends in <hi>London,</hi> to give Notice to the Lords to be ready, and that he was preparing for <hi>England.</hi> In the Courſe of this Tryal, a Point of Law never before heard of, was ſtarted, by the Lord High Steward, and the Solicitor General, namely, That tho' there were but one poſitive Evidence, in a Caſe of High Treaſon, if the reſt, tho' but circumſtantial, concurred therewith, it was ſufficient to find a Priſoner guilty; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſuppoſing one Man ſhould hear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, he intended to kill the King, upon ſuch a Day, and that another ſwears he ſaw the Party lie in wait to proſecute his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Evidence is ſufficient. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there might be in this Law, it was by no Means applicable to the Priſoner; for he moſt convincingly diſproved the main Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Saxton,</hi> and, by the cleareſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, made it appear, That neither the two Gentlemen nor himſelf were upon the

Spot upon the 4th of <hi>June;</hi> that two of them  were then actually in <hi>London,</hi> and the other ſixteen Miles off: He urged alſo, That if the Man had ſworn nothing but Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he could be no legal Witneſs, being himſelf a Priſoner, and taken in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, when <hi>Monmouth</hi> was routed, and conſequently under a Temptation to ſwear againſt him, to ſave his own Life; upon the whole he was acquitted, every one of the Peers declaring him not guilty. There were thoſe who condemned the Lawyers who had adviſed the King to bring a Peer to Tryal upon ſo ſlender a Foundation; while others obſerved, That as the King had committed him to Priſon, it was but fit he ſhould be brought to a public Tryal, leſt it ſhould be ſaid he had been detained when nothing appeared againſt him. But when all was over, I plainly ſaw the King was in great Rage with <hi>Saxton,</hi> and the next Day he declared, He ſhould be firſt convicted for Perjury, and then hanged for High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0170800300:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 one <hi>Mountfort,</hi> a Gentleman of his, who had been a Comedian, an excellent Mimic; and to divert the Company, as he was pleaſed to term it, he made him plead before him in a feigned Cauſe, during which he aped all the great Lawyers of the Age, in their Tone of Voice, and in their Action and Geſture of Body, to the very great Ridicule not only of the Lawyers, but of the Law it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which, to me, did not ſeem altogether ſo prudent in a Man of his loſty Station in the Law; diverting it certainly was, but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Lord High Chancellor, I ſhall never think it; but let us ſtep to the King.</p>
            <p>It was now know, That Mrs. <hi>Sidley,</hi> who had been the King's Miſtreſs, and had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Children by him, when Duke of <hi>York,</hi> but whom he had deſerted for a while when he came to the Crown, was as much in his Favour as ever; for he created her Counteſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and viſited her frequently, which gave the Queen a great deal of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs; but there was no Help for it; 'till at length her Majeſty's Party and Prieſts did ſo importune the King, and ſo preſſingly remonſtrate to him the Sin of this Amour, and what was worſe, the Diſparagement it would throw on their Religion, that it was reported he would abandon his Miſtreſs,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0170800300:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that he had ſent her Word, either to  retire into <hi>France,</hi> or to expect to have her Penſion of four thouſand Pounds a Year withdrawn.</p>
            <p>To reſume the Lord Chancellor once again, he had now like to have died of a Fit of the Stone, which he virtuouſly brought upon himſelf by a furious Debauch of Wine, at Mr. Alderman <hi>Duncomb</hi>'s; where he, the Lord Treaſurer, and others drank themſelves into that Height of Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, that, among Friends, it was whiſpered They had ſtripped into their Shirts, and that, had not an Accident prevented them, they had got up on a Sign-poſt, to drink the King's Health; which was the Subject of much Deriſion, to ſay no worſe.</p>
            <p>The Term, the Parliament was prorogued to, being expired, the Members of the Houſe of Commons, and the Lords, met in their reſpective Places. The Commons that appeared were to the Number of about 150; and being ſummoned, by the Black Rod, to appear in the Houſe of Lords, a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion directed to the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treaſurer, and others, impowering them, or any of them, to prorogue the Parliament 'till the 10th of <hi>May</hi> next, was read, and the Parliament was prorogued accordingly.</p>

 Though it could not be as yet ſaid, That the King had made any notable Invaſion on the Rights of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to all the Methods he could contrive and practice for the Increaſe of his own; by putting more Papiſts into Office in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but eſpecially in <hi>Ireland;</hi> by cauſing or at leaſt allowing of Popiſh Books to be printed, and ſold, and cried about publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; by publiſhing ſome Popiſh Papers found in the late King's Cloſet; by a Declaration that his late Majeſty died a Papiſt, and in what Manner; by an Account of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the late Ducheſs of <hi>York,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her Reaſons for the ſame, as written by her ſelf; by a Lettter or Order to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to direct the Clergy of his Province to preach a good Life, but never to meddle with Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in their Sermons; by ſending the Lord <hi>Caſtleman</hi> upon a ſolemn Embaſſy to the Pope, and by much more of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Tendency; which made it expected that more would infallibly follow.</p>

Thoſe who were more credulous in Points of this Nature than my ſelf, conceived the Evidence to be very ſtrong againſt her. The Boy ſhe was ſaid to have bewitched, fell down on a ſudden, before all the Court, when he ſaw her, and would then as ſuddenly return to himſelf again, and very diſtinctly relate the ſeveral Injuries ſhe had done him; But in all this it was obſerved, the Boy was free from any Diſtortion; that he did not foam at the Mouth, and that his Fits did not leave him gradually but all at once; ſo that, upon the whole, the Judge thought it proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0170800300:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 her; in which he ſeemed to act the Part of a wiſe Man. But tho' ſuch is my own private Opinion, I cannot help conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing my Story: One of my Soldiers being upon Guard about eleven in the Night, at the Gate of <hi>Clifford Tower,</hi> the very Night after the Witch was arraigned, he heard a great Noiſe at the Caſtle, and going to the Porch, he there ſaw a Scroll of Paper creep from under the Door, which as he imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by Moonſhine, turned firſt into the Shape of a Monkey, and thence aſſumed the Form of a Turky Cock, which paſſed to and fro by him. Surpriſed at this, he went to the Priſon, and called the Under-keeper, who came and ſaw the Scroll dance up and down and creep under the Door, where there was ſcarce an Opening of the Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of half a Crown. This extraordinary Story I had from the Mouth of both the one and the other: And now leave it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or disbelieved as the Reader may be inclined this Way or that.</p>
            <p>It is fit we obſerve, That the Way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Men, who propoſed any Buſineſs to themſelves in the Government, and eſpecially the Members of both Houſes of Parliament, that were in Poſſeſſion of Places, and near the King, was thus: His Majeſty took them
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0170800300:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aſide, and told them The Teſt Act was made  in the Height of Faction, not ſo much in Prejudice to the Roman Catholics in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as to himſelf in particular, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate his rightful Acceſſion; that while that, and the penal Laws remained in Force, no Soul of that Perſuaſion could be ſafe; that it was againſt all municipal Law, for Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Subjects to be excluded the Service of their Prince, or for a Prince to be reſtrained from employing ſuch Subjects as he thought for his Service; and that therefore he hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they would be ſo loyal as not to refuſe him their Voices for annulling ſuch unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Laws. Every Man that perſiſted in a Refuſal to comply with this Suggeſtion was ſure to be outed.</p>
            <p>The Time for the Meeting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now drawing near, and ſeveral of the Members neglecting to repair to <hi>London;</hi> the King ordered the Judges, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Circuits, to feel the Pulſes of the Men; in conſequence of which I was, to my great ſurpriſe, accoſted at <hi>York</hi> by the Judge, who told me, he had Orders to talk with me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject. I asked him if his Majeſty had made particular Mention of my Name; to which replying, That he had only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a general Order from the King, to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0170800300:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ſound the Inclinations of the ſeveral Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who ſat in Parliament, and that he had had a particular Inſtruction from the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor only, as to my ſelf by Name; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Time to conſider of it, and the next Morning returned for Anſwer, That I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Denial would be conſtrued into Diſloyalty; That I had ſo lately waited on the King, and given ſuch Aſſurance of my Integrity, that I could not apprehend his Majeſty could harbour any Doubt as to me, and the rather as he had not been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make Uſe of my Name; That I could not conceive my ſelf obliged to declare my ſelf to any Body elſe: But that if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſhould think fit to ſay any thing to me farther than he had already, when I had the Honour of waiting on him next, which I intended ſhould be ſpeedily, I would ſo conſult my Loyalty and my Conſcience, as to give him all the Satisfaction in my Power: The Judge told me he would make Report of what I had ſaid; and did not ſeem to be very forward in preſſing a Complyance; he had his Orders, and he obeyed them. I deemed this to be the moſt prudent Reply I could at this Time make; for had I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Affirmative, I might have incurred the Diſpleaſure and Cenſure of the greateſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0170800300:244"/>
Part of the Nation; if in the Negative, I  ſhould have utterly diſobliged the King; a Caution the more neceſſary to be taken, as there was no likelihood there would be any Meeting of Parliament, to control him in his Conduct. However I believe that in all Caſes of this Nature it is ſafeſt to unboſom ones ſelf to the Prince in Perſon, and as much as poſſible avoid the Danger that may ariſe from the Treachery, the Prejudice, or the Ignorance of a Reporter.</p>

 upon the ſame Occaſion declared, That it having been found impracticable to effect an Uniformity in Religion, tho' it had been the great Endeavour of four of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ſucceſſively, aſſiſted as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by their Parliament; and that ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts having been experienced to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prejudicial to the Kingdom, witneſs the Fatality of the Rebellion in his Father's Time; he was now determined to iſſue out a Declaration in Favour of all Sorts of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, that they might enjoy the free Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their own Religion: Hoping it might contribute to the general Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom, the Increaſe of the People, and the Advancement of Trade. But whatever the Reaſons alledged were, It appeared to moſt men, that a deep Deſign was laid to ſap the Foundations of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor could her Sons but dread ſome extraordinary Shocks; tho' ſome there were who apprehending no very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Conſequence of theſe Machinations, believed ſuch a Toleration might be of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Emolument, if conſidered in a political View; which was, by much the moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Side of the Building, which ſhall cloſe up this Year.</p>

At length the Declaration for Liberty of <label type="milestone">

But all this was too well underſtood to divide the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, <hi>Divide &amp; Impera,</hi> that ſo the Papiſts might with the more Eaſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves of the higheſt Place; which the Presbyterians or Calviniſts, who had, moſt of them began to conform, ſeemed to be well aware of; and therefore continued to reſort to our Churches, tho' the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Quakers, and Independants thought it worth their while to return their Addreſſes of Thanks and Acknowledgment. Elated, ſeemingly, with this, the King goes on in his old Courſe of diſplacing Gentlemen that had Poſts, but particularly ſuch as were of the Parliament, and obſtinate enough to withſtand his Wiſhes; and now the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0170800300:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 being prorogued it was not thought worth the Trouble to inquire which way any Body ſtood inclined, ſo that the late Queſtion concerning the Teſt and penal Laws was dropped, or at leaſt ſuſpended. All this Inequality of Uſage wrought but upon few Proteſtants either of Eſtate or Quality to change their Faith, little or not at all allured by the Baits thrown in their Way, or terrified by the King's Frowns and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Diſpleaſure: Honour therefore now was the grand Bulwark of our Religion, Gentlemen diſdaining to have thought they could ſacrifice the Sweets of Conſcience to the mercenary Views of a Reward: In the Midſt of this, dies the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> a Man once of vaſt Eſtate, and oftentimes in high Favour with the late King, tho' never with the preſent; a Man of the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Wit of his Time, the handſomeſt, and beſt bred; but unfortunately given up to Pleaſures, unſteady in his Ways, and, in all Reſpects, an Enemy to himſelf.</p>
            <p>While Addreſſes of Thanks were every Day preſented to the King, on the Part of the various Denominarions of Diſſenters, and from ſome even of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> I had frequent Alarms that the Papiſts were in a Way of perſuading the King to

grant them the Mannor of <hi>York,</hi> as a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary  for the Inſtruction of Youth in the Principles of their Faith; and I this Day heard it was granted accordingly to one <label type="milestone">

               <hi>Lawſon,</hi> a Prieſt, for a Term of thirty Years. Surpriſed at this, I wrote to the Lord <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſis,</hi> the principal Commiſſioner of the Treaſury, remonſtrating, That I had had it by my Commiſſion of Governor, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to myſelf by the late King, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this; that it was worth ſixty Pounds a Year to me, and that it had coſt me above two hundred Pounds in Repairs, ſince I had enjoyed it; and that as I had been allowed nothing for this Expence, I deſired it might be either continued to me, or that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed to grant me ſuch a Compenſation in lieu thereof, and conſider me in my Disburſment, in ſuch Manner and Proportion, as in his great Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Wiſdom he ſhould think fit. A few Days afterwards, a Proclamation came to hand, bearing Date the 2d of <hi>July,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the King diſſolved the Parliament, and at once ſtunned the main Body of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The next Day, the Pope's Nuncio be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make his public Entry at <hi>Windſor,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> one of the Lords of the Bedchamber in waiting, refuſed Attendance

 at that Solemnity; for which he was forbid the Court, and deprived of all his Places; the ſame Fate befel five of the ſix Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Privy Chamber, for the very ſelf ſame Cauſe; ſo that every Hour Things looked worſe and worſe. A while after I had a Letter from Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> to acquaint me that, according to my Deſire, he had ſpoke to the King concerning the Mannor of <hi>York;</hi> but that he had found he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it to Father <hi>Lawſon,</hi> for the Uſes above ſpecified; that his Majeſty told him, He did not know I lived in it, and that if I had been at any Charge in Repairs I ſhould be conſidered for the ſame; but added, for my preſent Comfort, That was I not ſo good a Man as he took me to be, he would not have kept a Governor at <hi>York</hi> ſo long as he had done: But I ſhortly after had another Letter from the ſame Lord, to tell me that the Lords Commiſſioners of the Treaſury had ſo repreſented the Buſineſs to the King, at <hi>Windſor,</hi> that no poſſitive Reſolution was as yet taken.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the impending Dangers which ſeemed to threaten us, there was a Nobleman, the Marquiſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who had by his Conduct perſuaded ſome People to think him mad, tho' he certainly acted
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0170800300:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon Principles of great human Prudence.  This Gentleman paſſing thro' <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> in his Way to <hi>London,</hi> I went to pay him a Viſit. He had four Coaches and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſes in his Retinue, and ſtaid ten Days at a Houſe he borrowed in our Parts. His Cuſtom was to dine at ſix or ſeven in the Evening, and his Meal always laſted 'till ſix or ſeven the next Morning; during which he ſometimes drank; ſometimes he liſtned to Muſic; ſometimes he fell into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; ſometimes he took Tobacco, and ſometimes he ate his Victuals; while the Company had free Choice to ſit or riſe, to go or come, to ſleep or not. The Diſhes and Bottles were all the Time before them on the Table; and when it was Morning he would hunt or Hawk, if the Weather was fair; if not, he would dance, go to Bed at eleven, and repoſe himſelf 'till the Evening. Notwithſtanding this Irregularity, he was a Man of great Senſe, and though, as I juſt now ſaid, ſome took him to be mad, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Meaning was to keep himſelf out of the Way of more ſerious Cenſure in theſe tickliſh Days, and preſerve his Eſtate, which he took great Care of.</p>

They went, but returned this Anſwer, That they were ſorry they ſhould be ſo unfortunate as to fall under his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Diſpleaſure; but that they could not proceed to a new Choice without actual Commiſſion of wilful Perjury, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hoped he would excuſe them. Now, in this Progreſs, it was an Obſervation gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made, that the King courted the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and diſcountenanced the Church of <hi>England:</hi> For the Papiſts being by no Means a Body of themſelves numerous enough to cope with the national Church, he thought to ſtrengthen them by a Junction with the Diſſenters, whom he blinded with his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, and with telling them

that he deſired a Repeal of the Teſt and  penal Laws, for their Eaſe and Security, as much as in Behalf of the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>A ſtrange Look it had, That the very People, who had lately been ſo indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly buſy to diveſt him of his Right, and even to deprive him of Life, it having been, in one Parliament, attempted to impeach him of High Treaſon, upon the Statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Reconciliation with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſay it looked ſtrange, that theſe very Men ſhould be preferred to thoſe who had preſerved him out of their Hands, not in Parliament only, but in the Field alſo; but it ſeems all Conſiderations are of no Worth or Validity with a hearty Zeal for the Prieſthood of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that Oblivion is ſo far from being Ingratitude, that it is highly to be commended, a moſt ſalutary Expedient, when for the Advantage of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church.</p>

I received a Letter from Father <hi>Lawſon,</hi> the Prieſt I formerly mentioned, to give me Notice, That the King having made him a Grant of his Houſe, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s in <hi>York,</hi> for the Honour of God and the good of his People, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from my uſual Civility, that I would give him free and eaſy Poſſeſſion. To which I anſwered, that I held it by Virtue of a Commiſſion that conſtituted me Governor of <hi>York;</hi> that he could not think I would diveſt my ſelf of it by my own Act and Deed; that I had too great a Veneration for the King's Bounty, and was too proud of his Service to do that; but that if his Majeſty poſitively commanded it, I ſhould have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to obey; with this Reſerve

however, That if his Majeſty gave it away,  I hoped, and in Juſtice it was a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on him to endeavour it, I was to have ſome Equivalent for the Loſs.

The clear Profits of this Place to me, beſides the Uſe of the Houſe for my ſelf and Friends, and Graſs and Hay for my Horſes while I ſtaid in Town, amounted to about forty Pounds a Year. After this, I expected the reſt would ſoon follow; for the King had cauſed or ordered the Lord Lieutenants of moſt, if not all, of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>England,</hi> to call together their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the Juſtices of the Peace, and ask them theſe three Queſtions, (1.) If in Caſe the King ſhould call a Parliament, and they ſhould be choſen Members of it, Whether
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0170800300:255"/>
 or no they would Vote to take away the Teſt and penal Laws? (2.) Whether or no they would give their Vote for ſuch Members as they believed would be for the Repeal for the ſame? (3.) Whether or no they would live peaceably, and as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to live, with ſuch as differed from them in Religion. Some Lord Lieutenants who refuſed to comply with this Order, were turned out to give Place to Papiſts, and the Deputy Lieutenants and Juſtices of the Peace who did not return a ſatisfactory Anſwer, were for the moſt Part diveſted of Office.</p>
            <p>This certainly was puſhing the Point by much too far, nor could Men forbear won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to what Purpoſe it could be meant; for what Anſwer could any Gentleman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give 'till he had heard the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Debates of the Houſe? And who could pretend to anſwer for the Man he voted to be a Member; or pretend to be ſure of what Sort of a Mind he would be when he got to his Seat in the Houſe? If the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Inclination had been to deceive the King, how eaſy was it for Men to expreſs themſelves one way and reſolve another? Beſides it was ſtriking at the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parliaments, thus to pre-engage the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0170800300:256"/>
Members, who according as Things, upon  their Meeting, appeared to them, are by the Laws of the Land allowed Freedom of Speech, and Freedom of Judgment. But the moſt general Anſwer that was returned by the Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was, That they, if of the Houſe, would ſo Vote as the Reaſons of the Debate ſhould prevail with them; that they would vote for ſuch as they thought would do the ſame; and that they would live quietly with all Men as good Chriſtians and loyal Subjects. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Time there were great Removes of Officers, Civil and Military, and moſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations were purged of their Church of <hi>England</hi> Aldermen, and Papiſts or Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appointed to ſucceed them. The King, however, ſoon after ſeemingly abated of the rigor of this Scrutiny, tho' the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants continued the Inquiry in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but with very little Succeſs.</p>
            <p>While this was tranſacting in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King was engaged in a high Diſpute with his Holineſs of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning the Immunities and Franchiſes of Ambaſſadors in that City, which tho' all the Princes of the Catholic Religion ſubmitted to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of, the King of <hi>France</hi> would not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Ambaſſador, who would have demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

 the antient Rights, was denied Audience, and perſiſting in the Thing, was declared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated; the Cardinals were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to viſit him as an Ambaſſador; and the Church of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> reputed the parochial Church of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, whither the Ambaſſador and his Retinue repaired to the midnight Maſs of <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> was interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for admitting him to partake of the Devotions of the Seaſon. Upon Notice of this, the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> was aſſembled, and the Attorney General drew up an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from <hi>Rome</hi> to the next general Council, ſetting forth that the Pope had no juſt Claim to Infallibility; that he had no Power to excommunicate Princes; that his prieſtly Authority was of no Weight in Temporals; and that the Power of the Keys was abuſed when ſubſervient to evil Ends. That his Holineſs had not only in this acted contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorily to his Character as Vicar, but alſo in refuſing Bulls to ſuch as his Majeſty had nominated and recommended to the vacant Biſhoprics in his own Kingdom, for no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but becauſe they would not acknowlege him to be infallible, or as the <hi>Italian</hi> Doctors call him <hi>Univerſal Monarch;</hi> that by this Means there were no fewer than thirty Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies unſupplied at this Day; and that the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0170800300:258"/>
Pope's Obſtinacy ought to be controled, as  as the Cuſtom had formerly been with the Church, by OEcumenic, or National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, After this, and much more, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney withdrew, and was by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment admitted as an Appellant in the Caſe; the Pope's Bull was at the ſame Time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared void; it was forbidden to diſperſe it within any Part of the Kingdom, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the King ſhould be humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to exert his Authority as to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Franchiſes of his Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome;</hi> and to call ſuch Councils, or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of great Men, as might apply a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to the Diſorders that had ariſen from the long Vacancies of Archbiſhoprics and Biſhoprics, and laſtly, that he would prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit all Commerce with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor ſuffer any Money to be ſent thither.</p>
            <p>This was a ſtrange Sort of a Scene to us in <hi>England.</hi> It was thought we were moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably linked together with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Kingdom; but while the one is abject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavouring to crouch to the Laſh, the other is ſeemingly reſolved to ſlip her Neck out of the Collar. But now a Proclamation <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Jan. 29.</label> is heard requiring public Thankſgiving to be made, for that our Queen found herſelf quick with Child. The Joy on Account of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0170800300:259"/>
 this News, if it created any to ſpeak of, was continually interrupted by ſome violent or unequal Act or other, on the Part of the King; among the reſt the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the firſt of his Dignity in the Realm, tho' low in Fortune, being commanded to uſe Intereſt in his Lieutenancy for the Repeal of the penal Laws and Teſt; and making Anſwer, in plain Terms, that he could not perſuade others to that, which in his own Conſcience he was averſe to, the King took his Regiment of Horſe from him, and gave it to the Duke of <hi>Berwick.</hi> Some Time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, the Earl of <hi>Burlington</hi> reſigned his Commiſſion for the Lord Lieutenancy of the Weſt-Riding of <hi>York,</hi> into the Hands of the King, who immediately gave it to Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> only Brother to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> a warm and Zealous Papiſt, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the Method his Majeſty had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tenaciouſly obſerved with regard to moſt of the Lieutenancies that became vacant in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Weſt-Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> had not been examined as to the Repeal of the Teſt <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>April 24.</label> and Penal-Laws; and now at the General Quarter Seſſions at <hi>Pomfret,</hi> the Popiſh Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, in Number ſix, and Sir <hi>John Bointon,</hi> the King's Serjeant, who, as I preſume,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0170800300:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aſpired to be a Judge, moved that an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs  of Thanks might be ſigned and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his Majeſty for his late Indulgence as to Matters of Conſcience, and that not only by all the Juſtices, but by the two Grand Juries: But none of the Juſtices ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſix above and one Mr. <hi>Bull,</hi> nor ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Grand Juries would ſet their Hands to this Addreſs; ſo that the Roman Catholics ſent it up, ſigned by themſelves, as the Act of the whole Seſſions. By ſuch Tricks and Artifices as theſe the King was deceived in the Opinion his Subjects had of his late Indulgence; three or four Men, in ſeveral Places as well as this, pretending to ſpeak and anſwer for the whole Corporation, or County.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>May 7.</label> A few Days afterwards, a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Juſtice told me the King was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that he had been ill adviſed in puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Queſtion concerning the Repeal of the Teſt; that he intended to put out ſome Juſtices and admit others, tho' not by that Method, but by informing himſelf, from ſuch as he knew to be true to his Service, how they ſtood affected as to Liberty of Conſcience; and that he had particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> who had the ſame from the King, to adviſe firſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0170800300:261"/>
 with me upon that Subject. I told him that the Method lately taken had moſt aſſuredly been of no Advantage to his Majeſty, moſt of the principal and powerful Gentlemen, in every County, having been thereby thruſt out of Employment: But that this new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod would be attended with as great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and be ſubject to the fame Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it being impoſſible for one Man to pry into the Receſſes of another Man's Heart; nay, that it was even a hard Matter for a Man to promiſe for himſelf. For according to the Suppoſition, he was to be either in Parliament, or out of it; if he himſelf ſhould be elected, he could not honeſtly promiſe which Way he ſhould vote 'till he came to his Seat, and heard the Debates; and that if he was not elected, it would be quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in any Degree to anſwer for the Man he ſhould chuſe for his Repreſentative; that I believed moſt Men thought a Liberty of Conſcience might be of Uſe and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Nation, if ſettled upon a proper Foundation, and with true Regard to the Rights and Privileges of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> To this he replied, that the King had openly declared the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have any reaſonable Equivalent ſhe could deſire for her Security, provided an
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0170800300:262"/>
Act might paſs for the Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;  and told me we ſhould meet and talk farther upon this Head, which for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I evaded as much as poſſible; I cared not to explain myſelf quite, having no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to expoſe myſelf any farther than was barely needful, or to give Characters of other Men. <label type="milestone">

            <p>Having at two ſeveral Times obtained Leave to repair to <hi>London,</hi> I there found Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to ſtand much in the Poſture I expected. The popiſh Party was very urgent with the King to preſs the Repeal of the Laws againſt them, and the other as obſtinate and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong againſt it; and what brought the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute to a ſtill greater Degree of Warmth, was owing to what follows: His Majeſty had lately renewed his Proclamation for Liberty of Conſcience, and given Order to the Biſhops, to cauſe it be read in the Churches of their reſpective Dioceſes. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the reſt of the Order, remonſtrated againſt this; ſetting forth, in a Petition they preſented to the King, That they could not pay his Majeſty Obedience in what he was pleaſed to require of them; that no Biſhop, or Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England</hi> could aſſent to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, which muſt of courſe be implyed
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0170800300:263"/>
 by their reading it or cauſing it to be read; that a Declaration of the ſame Nature, on the Part of the King, had been in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment condemned twice in the late Reign; that therefore they might be liable to be called to an Account hereafter, for doing what had been adjudged contrary to Law; that tho' the King of himſelf could do no wrong, his Miniſters or Agents were reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for whatever was done infractory of the Law; and tho' his Majeſty had been pleaſed to declare a Liberty of Conſcience, it was, nevertheleſs, the Duty of the Clergy, as much as in them lay, to perſuade Men into an adherence to their Communion; that for them to publiſh the King's Pleaſure, in the Manner required, would be the ſame as if they told the People They needed not to come to Church except they pleaſed; and that by the ſame Rule he might command them to read Maſs in their Churches, and be found to obey: Theſe and many other Arguments were, upon this Occaſion, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Biſhops; at which the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo violent a Diſpleaſure, that they were commanded to appear in Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, on the 8th of <hi>June.</hi>

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0170800300:264"/>
I was honoured with a Viſit from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs  of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> who expreſſed himſelf pretty well inclined for Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but averſe to the Teſt and penal Laws all at once, tho' he was ſeemingly not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing it ſhould be done gradually, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wiſe and weighty Conſiderations.</p>

This they refuſed to do, ſaying they were not to engage themſelves under any Security of the Kind, 'till the Information or Indictment was found, and that by ſo doing they ſhould not only run counter to the Law, but betray the Liberty of the Peerage; upon which the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and his ſix Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, were committed Priſoners to the Tower, a Severity moſt deeply reſented by the whole Church. Being then at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> I ſaw the Biſhops going to take Water for the Tower: They all looked very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, called to me, and asked me how I did. The next Day the Lord <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> one of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0170800300:265"/>
 the Privy Council, told me, That had the King known how far the Thing would have gone, he had never laid the Injunction he did, to have the Declaration read in Churches.</p>

But as important as this Event might ſeem to be, little Notice may be ſaid to have been taken of it. The Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Biſhops was now uppermoſt in the Minds of moſt of the People, who flocked to them in ſuch Numbers, for their Bleſſing, and to condole their hard Uſage, that great and very extraordinary Remarks were made both of Perſons and Behaviour. Among the reſt, ten Nonconformiſt Miniſters went to pay them a Viſit, which the King took ſo heinouſly, that he ſent for four of them to reprimand them; but their Anſwer was, That they could not but adhere to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, as Men conſtant and firm to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Faith, or to that Purpoſe. Nay, what is more extraordinary, the very Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that kept Guard in the Tower, would frequently drink good Health to the Biſhops; which being underſtood by Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> Conſtable of the Tower, he ſent Orders to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0170800300:266"/>
the Captain of the Guard, to ſee it was done  no more; but the Anſwer he received was, That they were doing it at the very Inſtant, and would drink that, and no other Health, while the Biſhops were there.</p>

Upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Palace-yards</hi> were crouded with thouſands of People, who begging their Bleſſing as they paſſed, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop freely gave it, and as freely, at the ſame time, exhorted them to be conſtant to their Religion. A fortnight afterwards, an <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>29</label> Information was exhibited againſt their Lordſhips, in the King's Bench, for that they had framed and publiſhed a ſeditious Libel; of which the Jury would not find them guilty, The Council for the Biſhops, the ableſt of their Profeſſion in all <hi>England,</hi> produced ſuch Arguments in their Behalf, that the Judges were divided, two of them declaring that the Proofs did not extend to the making their Petition or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs a Libel, and two of them that they did, which coſt Sir <hi>Richard Holloway</hi> and Sir <hi>John Powell</hi> their Seats on the Bench,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0170800300:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 as ſoon as the Term was over. In the Courſe of this Tryal, the Power of the King to diſpenſe with the Laws, that grand Point, was moſt exquiſitely diſcuſſed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Council, who were ſo much an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match for the King's, that at Court it was moſt heartily wiſhed this Buſineſs had never been puſhed to ſuch a Criſis. <hi>Weſtminſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> the <hi>Palace-yards,</hi> and all the Streets about, were thronged with an infinite Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe loud Shouts and joyful Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations upon hearing the Biſhops were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, were a very Rebellion in Noiſe, tho' very far from ſo either in Fact or Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Bonfires were made, not only in the City of <hi>London,</hi> but in moſt Towns in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as ſoon as the News reached them; tho' there were ſtrict and general Orders given out to prevent all ſuch doings; and the Clergy preached more loudly, and more freely than ever againſt the Errors of the Latin Church. The next Day I waited on the King to the Camp on <hi>Hounſlow-heath,</hi> where every Body obſerved him to labour under a very great Diſturbance of Mind; but he ſpoke very kindly to me as I rode by him, upon ſeveral Occaſions.</p>

and ſome Days afterwards, at the ſame held  for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> at <hi>Hicks</hi>'s <hi>Hall,</hi> where I found ſuch a ſtrange Revolution among the Juſtices of the Peace, ſo many Papiſts and Fanatics put into the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I neither ſought Buſineſs, nor choſe to mix with them. At this laſt Place there were ſeveral indicted as Rioters, for that they had been concerned in making of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, or contributed thereto; but the Grand Jury would find no Bill, tho' they were ſent out no leſs than three Times; ſo generally did the Love of the Biſhops and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Cauſe prevail. And now my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> adviſed me to conſider with myſelf, Whether as Affairs ſtood, it were prudent to continue in my Imployments: I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I had great Obligations to the King, and would ſerve him as well as I could, whilſt he would allow me that Honour, without concerning himſelf with my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0170800300:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 but the real Cauſe was to appeaſe the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were ready to mutiny, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome of their Captains, who had publickly celebrated Maſs in their Ships. The King flattered them all he could; went from Ship to Ship; called them his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſaid he had nothing to do with their Religion, and that he granted Liberty of Conſcience to all; but that he expected they would behave like Men of Honour and Courage when there ſhould be Occaſion for their Service; tho' they were ſo far grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that all the Prieſts were ordered on Shore. Admiral <hi>Herbert,</hi> an able Seaman, who n the King had diſcarded from ſeveral great Poſts, becauſe he would not promiſe to vote for the Repeal, went privately away to <hi>Holland,</hi> where he was made Rear-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral; which raiſed Anger in the King, and the rather, as a great many Seamen went after him.</p>

Some Days afterwards, carrying my Wife and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0170800300:270"/>
Daughter to <hi>Windſor,</hi> to wait on the Queen;  I perceived the Court to be under ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and the King in an ill Humour, tho' he was of an Equanimity which made it difficult to diſcover, at the News that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had fitted out a large Fleet as deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt us; and that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> were on the Brink of a Rupture, and would each of them preſs us ſoon to know which Side we would take. This, conſidering the Jealouſies we were under on Account of Religion, the violent Diſcontents about the Army, and the ill Time of the Day it was to call a Parliament for freſh Supplies of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, did very juſtly and reaſonably diſquiet the Court. And now the firſt Thing the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Aug. 24.</label> King did, was to declare he would call a Parliament, to meet the 27th of <hi>November</hi> following, proteſting in Council, that he was moved thereto more for the Good and Satisfaction of the Nation, than for any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion he was under of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. However, he commanded all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in general to their Poſts, and drew the Forces out of other Garriſons and Places to man the Sea Ports.</p>
            <p>Deſigning for <hi>York,</hi> I took Leave of his <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>28</label> Majeſty, but with terrible Apprehenſions that he would put the ſame Queſtion to me
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0170800300:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 he had to others, concerning the Repeal; but he ſaid nothing at all of it, only enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to ſtand a Candidate, for the next Parliament at <hi>York,</hi> which I would gladly have been excuſed, but it could not be; and ſo he wiſhed me a good Journey. Juſt at this Time I had News, that the Queſtion had been put, the Week before, to all our Juſtices of the Weſt-Riding, and that they had all anſwered in the Negative; ſo that I could not but think I had a lucky eſcape.</p>
            <p>I ſent Notice to the Mayor and others of <hi>York,</hi> that I intended to ſtand for one of their Repreſentatives, at the enſuing Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and found the Magiſtracy would be for the moſt Part againſt me, tho' I had good Encouragement from the other Citizens. The Truth is, I was at ſome Loſs to know how to act in this Matter; I was not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be of this Parliament, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was grown infirm and almoſt unfit to attend the Duty of the Houſe, but alſo becauſe I was afraid the King would expect more from me than my Conſcience would extend to; for as I was determined not to violate this on the one Side, ſo I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolve to offend ſo good a Maſter on the other. In theſe Straits, I went to the King at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and ſhewed him the Letters I
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0170800300:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had ſent to <hi>York,</hi> and the Anſwers I had  received thereto; deſiring his Majeſty to indulge me with Replies to three Queries I had to make, (1.) Whether, ſeeing the Conteſt was like to be both chargeable and difficult, and the Succeſs extremely doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it was his Pleaſure I ſhould ſtand? He replied poſitively, I ſhould. (2.) Whether, as the Oppoſition was very ſtrong againſt me, he would impute it to my Remiſsneſs if I miſcarried? He promiſed he would not. (3.) Whether he would aſſiſt me all he could to prevent my being baffled, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſuch Means as I ſhould propoſe to him? His Anſwer was, Yes; and he gave immediate Orders to the Lords for purging of Corporations, to make whatever Change or Alteration I deſired in the City of <hi>York,</hi> and to put in or out, which the King it ſeems had reſerved to himſelf by the laſt Charter, juſt as I pleaſed. But I was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of what I did in this Regard: I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that if I put out none, it would look as if I had no Power, and debaſe me into Contempt; and that if I diſplaced too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it might exaſperate the City againſt me, make them believe I was too deep in the Court Intereſt, and prevent my Succeſs on the other Hand; I therefore only deſired
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0170800300:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 that the Lord Mayor might be diſmiſſed his Office, and Sir—<hi>Thompſon</hi> appointed in his ſtead, which would prevent his being a Member of Parliament; and that too, Mr. <hi>Edward Tomſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ramſden,</hi> who were my principal Friends in the former Election of me for <hi>York,</hi> and were afterwards turned out partly on my Account, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored as Aldermen. Then taking leave of the King, and preſented him with ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Medals, which he took very kindly, he again charged me to do what I could to be choſen.</p>
            <p>I afterwards deſired Mr. <hi>Brent,</hi> the Agent for Corporation Matters, that if he had the Power, I might with ſome others I ſhould name, be added to the Bench of Juſtices in that City, by a Writ of Aſſiſtance, which he promiſed me ſhould be done. To leave this Affair for the preſent, there had at this Time been fifty <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> and Papiſts ſent for from <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> in order to be incorporated into his Regiment. Every Captain was to have ſome; but Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and five Captains more, who were all that were then on the Spot, in Quarters at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> refuſed to take a Man of them, ſaying their Companies were complete, and that they were not to

part with good Soldiers and <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> to  make Room for ſuch as were inferior to them and Foreigners; deſiring they might chuſe their own Men, or throw up their Commiſſions. The Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> took great Offence at this, and ſending an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it to the King, he diſpatched twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Horſe to bring them up in Cuſtody to <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, where they were to be tryed by a Council of War; and they were brought up accordingly. I ſpoke to them juſt as they arrived, and found they were all reſolved to ſtand it out; but they told me the Duke had not offered a Man of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to any Company, then in his Grace's Regiment, which was very kind of him on his Part, and a miraculous Eſcape on mine.</p>
            <p>Mean while, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador had lately given the King Aſſurances that their Preparations were not againſt us; but his Majeſty, as if he made a Doubt of it, ordered great Things towards a Fleet for the Spring; and I was poſitively told, by one, that he had actually twenty five hundred thouſand Pounds in his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0170800300:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 greateſt Enemy to my Election, not having Patience to ſtay till I came, diſmiſs'd it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon as aſſembled, fearing I ſhould make ſome Proſelytes to my Intereſt. Juſt on the Back of this comes down a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſetting forth a certain Intention the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had to invade this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the Aſſiſtance and with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the States General, both with a ſtrong Fleet and a numerous Army; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all Lord Lieutenants, Deputy Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, and all other his Majeſty's Officers, to hold themſelves in Readineſs to defend the King and Kingdom. At this Time Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> was Lieutenant of the Weſt Riding, a rigid Papiſt, and now gone Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome.</hi> He had left but three Deputies behind him, two of which alſo were Papiſts, and but two of the three were now in the Country; while moſt of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> were come to the City, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to meet with Writs for the Choice of Members.

The next Day I prevailed with the Lord Mayor to call a Hall; upon which Occaſion I ſpoke to them a full half Hour, and ſo convinced them of the evil Arts which had been put in Practice againſt me, and the great Injuſtice done me, that they all ſeemed to be Converts in my Favour; and to add to what I had ſaid, I gave them up the Keys, but made them own it as a Courteſy, and promiſe to reſtore them to me again, whenever I deſired it, for his Majeſty's Service. And now Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic and Lord Lieutenant of

 the North Riding, being at <hi>York,</hi> obſerved to me it could be for no good End that the Lords <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Danby</hi> were come down to the Country; tho the former pretended he was only come to view his Eſtate, and the latter to drink the Waters at <hi>Knaisbourgh.</hi> They were both of them frequently enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Converſation at Sir <hi>Henry Gooderick</hi>'s, and the firſt of them came to <hi>York,</hi> where I paid all imaginable Civilities to him, and received the ſame from him; the other I waited on at Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s, not once ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Men of their high Quality and great Eſtate could intend any thing prejudicial to the Government or dangerous to themſelves; and indeed their outward Behaviour was very decent and innocent.</p>
            <p>Two Days afterwards I had an Expreſs from Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> the new Secretary of State, <hi>Sunderland,</hi> who was turned Papiſt, and had been the Author of great Miſchief ſince he had been near the King, being laid aſide, to acquaint me that his Majeſty had given a very kind Reception to our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation on the Part of the County, and that in Compliance therewith he had named the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to be Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of all <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> and his Grace coming to town ſoon after, appointed his Deputies and

The fate Lord Mayor being now ſuperſeded, tho' it was impoſſible to ſwear the new one in, becauſe of ſome Miſtakes with Regard to the new Charter, it may be ſaid that <hi>York</hi> was now a very remarkable Place; for it was an Archbiſhopric without a Biſhop, a City without a Mayor, and a Garriſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Soldier. But theſe Defects were ſoon ſupplyed; the old Charter was reſtored and the old Lord Mayor therewith; the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who fled from that City upon the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Landing, was made Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop

of <hi>York;</hi> and I had one Company of Foot ſent to continue with me.</p>
            <p>Strange it was, and a certain Preſage of the Miſchiefs which attended this Invaſion, that neither the Gentry nor the Commona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were under any Concern about it: Said they, the Prince comes only to maintain the Proteſtant Religion.—He will do no Harm to <hi>England:</hi> While on the other Hand it was from Court ſuggeſted that his Aim was at the Crown, and that the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who aſſiſted him, graſped at the Trade of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> In truth, his Highneſſes Declaration, when it made its Appearance, which was a little while before he landed, ſeemed to be dark and ambiguous enough, ſetting forth all the Grievances of the Nation with great Aggravation, and aſſerting that the King's Intention was to ſubvert the Government both in Church and State; that he deſigned to make himſelf abſolute, and to extirpate the Proteſtant Religion; that to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had inſiſted on a diſpenſing Power; that he had moulded and faſhioned all the Charters to his Mind, to the End he might have ſuch Members of Parliament as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; that he had examined and pre-enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſuch as he intended ſhould be of the Houſe of Commons; and that what was

to the Purpoſe. Three Days afterwards the  Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration, conveyed by an unknown Hand to a Citizen of ours, was brought to me, and I immediately tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the Secretary of State. Orders were at the ſame Time ſent down to us to ſecure the Lord <hi>Lumley,</hi> then in the North Riding; but the Gentleman, Colonel <hi>John Darcy,</hi> who was charged with this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, pretended he could not find him, tho' it afterwards appeared his Lordſhip was not far off, and might have been ſeized at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

In three Days more I received by another Expreſs that the Prince was actually landed at <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay,</hi> in the Weſt, (on the 5th of this Month, <hi>November)</hi> and that he had marched ſtrait to <hi>Exeter,</hi> attended by Marſhall <hi>Schomberg,</hi> an old and experienced Officer, together with a Number of our own Nobility and Gentry of conſiderable Name, and a great Land Army.</p>
            <p>I immediately ſent the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Word of this Invaſion, tho' he had Notice
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0170800300:285" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 of it from above; but he wrote back that the Prince being landed at ſuch a Diſtance: his Preſence would be no way neceſſary at <hi>York.</hi> I thought this a very weak Anſwer, and ſent him Word that the Danger was not only from the Invaders, but alſo from their Confederates at home, and that it was impoſſible the Prince ſhould dare to attack <hi>England</hi> with an Army of under 20000 Men, if he was not very ſure of Aſſiſtance from our ſelves. The Deputy Lieutenants, being ten in Number, were now all at <hi>York,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſollicitous to preſerve Peace, Quiet, and good Order, propoſed a Meeting of the Gentry and Freeholders of the County, to be held on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 19th inſtant, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to draw up ſome Declaration of unſhaken Loyalty to the King in this Time of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as alſo to conſult on ſuch Matters as might be for the Honour of God, and our own Welfare and Safety.

The Duke took this ſo much amiſs, that he declared he would not ſtay to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted or overuled by his Deputies, and that he would be gone the next Day.

beſides a mere Declaration of Loyalty were  thought neceſſary, it might be ſo penned, and with that Modeſty as both to ſatisfy here, and not diſpleaſe above; in ſhort, that his Grace ought, at all Events, to be on the Spot in a Time of ſuch great Trouble and Difficulty. But he went away according to his Word, ſaying no Body had been of his Side but my ſelf.</p>

I would not go to them at the Common Hall, which was the Place appointed; nor indeed was I very well able, by reaſon of ſome Bruiſes I had received by my Horſe's falling upon me: But I heard that in the Midſt of about a hundred Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who met, Sir <hi>Henry Gooderick</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf to this Effect; That there having been great Endeavours made by the Government of late Years to bring Popery into the Kingdom, and by many Devices to ſet at nought the Laws of the Land, there could be no proper Redreſs of the many Grievances we laboured under, but by a free Parliament; that now was the only Time to prefer a Petition of the Sort; and that they could not imitate a better Pattern than had been ſet before them by ſeveral Lords Spiritual and Temporal. There were thoſe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0170800300:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 who differed with him in Opinion, and would have had ſome Expreſſions in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per moderated and amended; and obſerved that at the ſame time they petitioned as they deſigned, it would be but their Duty to aſſure his Majeſty, They would ſtand firm by him in the midſt of the Dangers which threatned both him and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, at the Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes; but this was overuled. When therefore the Draught was completed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind of Sir <hi>Henry Gooderick</hi> and his Friends, tho' ſeveral diſliked it and went away, they proceeded to ſign; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a third Man could ſubſcribe it, in comes one Mr. <hi>Tankard</hi> with a rueful Story That the Papiſts were riſen; and that they had actually fired upon the Militia Troops. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at this, the Gentlemen ran out; and thoſe that were privy to the Deſign betook them to their Horſes, which were conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently at hand for their Purpoſe.

Theſe rode up to

the four Militia Troops, drawn out on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther  Account, and cryed out <hi>A free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Proteſtant Religion, and no Popery.</hi> The Captains of theſe Troops were Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Gower,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and Captain <hi>Tankard,</hi> who being admitted of the Secret the Night before, tho' prompt and ready enough in their Nature for any Action of the Kind, immediately cryed out the ſame, and led their Troops over to them. In the firſt Place they went to the main Guard of the ſtanding Company, which, the Number not exceeding twenty, they ſurpriſed, before I had the leaſt Notice or even Jealouſy of what was in Agitation; not thinking it poſſible that Men of ſuch Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſuch Eſtates, could give Way to their Diſcontent, however great and juſt it might be, to the Degree of engaging themſelves in an Attempt ſo deſperate, and ſo contrary to the Laws they boaſted, and the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they profeſſed. But I had no ſooner No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what had been tranſacted, than I ſent for the Officers and the Guard, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood they were Priſoners. I then ſent to each Captain of the four Troops, injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to bring his Troop to me as the King's Governor, as alſo to the Main Guard of the Militia Foot; but they would not
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0170800300:291" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ſtir a Step; they would hearken to no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. I then ſent for my own Horſes, and was juſt ready to go to the Troops, in hopes, by my Preſence, to regain them to the King's Service, when Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſſis,</hi> who had commanded a Regiment in <hi>Holland,</hi> under the Prince, and had lurked about a long while in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> for his Highneſs's Service, drew up a Party of thirty Horſe before my Door, and prevented my ſtirring abroad till Lord <hi>Danby,</hi> and his principal Companions, came up to me.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip told me that to reſiſt were to no manner of End or Purpoſe; that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Gentlemen with him, were in Arms for a free Parliament, and the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Proteſtant Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as by Law eſtabliſhed, which the King had almoſt brought to nothing, and which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore; and that he hoped I would join them in ſo laudable an Effort. I made Anſwer that I was for a free Parliament and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion as well as they, but that I was alſo for the King: His Lordſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that he was ſo too, and that he hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as we agreed in Principles, we ſhould concur in Action: I told him tho' we exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed in the Matter, we differed widely
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0170800300:292" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as to the Manner; and I could not conceive  it lawful to extort any Thing from the Crown by any manner of Force; and that as I had the Honour of being his Majeſty's Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for <hi>York,</hi> it was impoſſible, whatever the Conſequences might be, for me to join in Concert with thoſe who openly and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly acted in repugnance to and contempt of his Authority and Commiſſion. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip then ſaid, he muſt impriſon me; to which I made Anſwer, that I was naked and deſtitute of Friends and Aſſiſtance, and that I acknowledged my ſelf in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Power to do with me as he would: But after ſome ſhort Conſultation, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip told me, he knew me to be a Man of Honour, and that he ſhould think my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement not to ſtir, to be as ſure and as cloſe a Reſtraint upon me, as a Guard or a Priſon; ſo that upon the Pledge of my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I was to confine my ſelf to my Room; his Lordſhip, however, recommended what he had offered to my farther Conſideration. They then ſeized on all the Gates, poſted ſtrong Guards every where, and ſuffered none to go in or out; they ſecured ſuch Perſons as betrayed a Diſlike to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and eſpecially the Officers of the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0170800300:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Company; but the Company it ſelf revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them the next Day.</p>
            <p>Gathered to this Head, the next Day they viſited the Magazine and Stores, which, God knows, were next to nothing, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all my moſt preſſing Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances to the King, both formerly and of late. The Militia Troops then, and ſome of the Gentlemen who came in to ſerve as Voluntiers, and who were not above ſixty, ranſacked the Houſes of ſeveral Papiſts, for Prieſts, Arms, and Horſes, which they took wherever they found them. They ſeized alſo on a Company of Foot new raiſed, but not yet armed, in their Quarters at <hi>Tadcaſter,</hi> and a Company of Grenadiers as they were on their March for <hi>London,</hi> by the Way of <hi>York;</hi> but as yet they touched the Property of no Man but the Kings, the Papiſts and my ſelf excepted, for they made very free with my Coals, and other Proviſion I had ſaid in for the Uſe of the Garriſon.</p>

This Declaration
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0170800300:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being the next Day printed, there appeared  of Hands of Lords to it, ſix; of Lords Sons, three; of Baronets, five; of Knights, ſix; of Eſquires and Gentlemen, ſixty ſix; and of Citizens of <hi>York,</hi> fifty ſix. We had now News from <hi>Nottingham,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> and many more Noblemen and Gentlemen were riſen alſo in thoſe Parts, and that great Numbers flocked in to them.</p>
            <p>Mean while the King was on his March to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which he had appointed to be the general Rendezvous of his whole Army, having ſent the young Prince, his Son, to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> as the Report was by ſome, but to <hi>France</hi> according to others. In a Day or two, I made it my Requeſt to the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> that he would give me leave to be a Priſoner at my own Houſe in the Country, where I promiſed to act nothing to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, but to aquieſce, and abide by my Word as a true Priſoner. Hereupon he ſent for me to come and dine with him; and at my coming into the Room told me, That to give me the better Stomach to my Meal, I might, upon the Terms I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, depart whenever I pleaſed. At Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner his Lordſhip told me the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi>'s Abſence had been what principally
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0170800300:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 favoured their Deſign; and that he doubted not but I had ſome Fear or Suſpicion of what was going forward: I anſwered, that I did indeed believe they would go very high in their Petition, but never imagined ſo many Gentlemen of their Rank and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would have ventured upon ſo perilous an Expedient; and that if I had been aware of it, I ſhould certainly have made a Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, tho' to ever ſo little Purpoſe, or at leaſt have made my Eſcape out of the Town. I had Diſcourſe with ſeveral of theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and perceived that they began to reflect on what they had done, as of more Danger than they at firſt thought of, and found they were troubled, that Men come in ſo ſlowly to them. Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> ſaid it was the firſt Time that any <hi>Bertie</hi> had been concerned againſt the Crown; that it was a Grief to him, but that the Neceſſity of the Times was fatally ſuch, that there had been no avoiding it. To this I obſerved, that the flagrant Invaſion on our Rights might have been reſtrained without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſſing Force, and that a thorough and plain repreſentation of our Injuries, properly urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Part of the whole Kingdom, could not have failed to reduce the King to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and juſter Senſe of what he was about;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0170800300:296" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the great want of Money, the violent  Diſtraction of the Nation, and a plain Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery that Popery could never again be impoſed upon us, would have obliged his Majeſty, for his own Sake, for his own Safety and Intereſt, to have altered the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his Conduct. Sir <hi>Henry Gooderick</hi> would then have perſuaded me to ſign their Declaration, but I told them I could not poſſibly do it; for that tho' I ſhould be of a Mind with them, as to the Matter it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, yet being now in Arms I could not, in my Judgment, conceive but a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with them, as to the Contents of their Paper, might be juſtly conſtrued into a join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them in the Force. Mr. <hi>Tankard</hi> alſo moſt earneſtly preſſed me to be with them, but I held out. In the midſt of this comes the Clerk of the Peace to give me No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a new Commiſſion that was brought down, which reſtored all the Gentlemen of the Weſt Riding I have formerly obſerved to have been turned out; but that myſelf and two more were omitted. Lord <hi>Danby</hi> immediately took up this, and told me it was plain There was a Reſentment againſt me, and that it was very evident I ſhould meet with worſe Quarter on the other Side, than from them; but all this had no manner
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0170800300:297" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 of Effect upon me. The next Day the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> ſent Orders to his Captains of Horſe to diſmiſs the Militia Troops; but they inſtead of obeying his Orders, laughed at him for his ill-timed Meſſage.</p>
            <p>This Day I obtained a Paſs of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralſhips to go to my own Home, upon my Parole that I would confine my ſelf there, nor exceed the Bounds of five Miles about, and live peaceably and quietly, and abſtain from all Manner of hoſtile Action. We had now News as if the Army had voted for a free Parliament, tho' at the ſame Time they declared they would defend his Majeſty's Perſon from all Men without Exception; the very Matter I deſired to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of our <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Petition. But on the Heels of this laudable Reſolution, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as we were told, that a Number of great Men, Officers of the Army, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Confidents of the King, had revolted and gone over to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that on the 19th of <hi>November,</hi> the King having then reached <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where his Army was rendezvouſed, the Lord <hi>Churchill,</hi> one of his Major Generals, under Pretence of ſhewing him his Outguards, miſled his Majeſty into a Train which muſt have betrayd him to the Hands of a Party
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0170800300:298" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Army, had not an  immoderate Bleeding at the Noſe prevented the King from proceeding; and that the ſaid Lord perceiving his Deſign to be thus fruſtrated, immediately went over to the Prince, accompanied by the Duke of <hi>Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Berkley,</hi> and others; tho', it muſt be obſerved, that this Lord <hi>Churchill</hi> was raifed from a Page to the King, to the Degree of a Viſcount of <hi>England,</hi> and in Poſſeſſion of a great Eſtate therewith, which was entirely owing to his Majeſty's Bounty. The King aſtoniſhed, and not knowing who to truſt, returned to <hi>Andover,</hi> on the 24th, where he ſat at Supper with Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> his Son-in-law, and the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> bnt to the Surprize of all Men, they both deſerted him that very Night, and withdrew to the Prince, together with others of good Note and Account. The very next Day, the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted privately from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with Lady <hi>Churchill,</hi> and took Refuge at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> Now the Number of all that thus forſook the King did not as yet amount to one thouſand, but ſuch a mutual Jealouſy now took Birth, that there was no relying on any one, no knowing who would be true and honeſt to the Cauſe; wherefore
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0170800300:299"/>
 the Army and Artillery were ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire back towards <hi>London,</hi> where his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty arrived on the 26th, his Out-quarters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Windſor, Reading,</hi> and Places round about.</p>
            <p>The next Day he called together all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal then in Town, being about fifty in Number, and purſuant to their Advice, Writs were immediately iſſued out for calling a free Parliament, and for removing all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Imployments; for iſſuing out a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon to all who were with the Prince, and for ſending Commiſſioners to treat with him. The Proclamation accordingly came out, the Parliament was to meet upon the 15th of <hi>January</hi> next enſuing, and the Lords <label type="milestone">

               <hi>Hallifax, Nottingham,</hi> and <hi>Godolphin,</hi> were appointed Commiſſioners to the Prince. But to return back a little to our northern Parts, <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> or <hi>Hull,</hi> that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Garriſon was at this Time ſurpriſed by Mr. <hi>Copley,</hi> the Lieutenant Governor, who gathering a Party to him, ſeiſed the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor himſelf, Lord <hi>Langdale,</hi> in the Night, as alſo a Number of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics who fled for Refuge to that Place; and the Soldiers joining in the Treachery, they declared for the King, and the Proteſtant Religion, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0170800300:300"/>
ſent immediate Notice to <hi>York</hi> of what they  had done. About the ſame Time a Party was diſpatched from <hi>York</hi> to ſeiſe the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s Horſes and Arms, which they did, but no Manner of Attempt or Injury was offered to his Grace's Perſon. In ſhort, there were but few Gentlemen in our Parts of the County that adhered to the King; nor indeed in any Part of the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

In the Midſt, as it were of this, the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> is brought from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> when every Soul concluded he was in <hi>France:</hi> But he made no Continuance; the Queen the very next Night, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> carrying him, about twelve of the Clock, down to a Veſſel privately prepared, which by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Gale was wafted over to <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> The next Day a Regiment of <hi>Scotch</hi> Horſe deſerted to the Prince, nor was there an Hour ſcarce but his Majeſty received, like <hi>Job,</hi> ill News of one Sort or other; ſo that, prompted thereto, by moſt fatal Advice, he the next Day, being the 11th, withdrew himſelf privately, attended only by two or three Perſons, to follow the Queen, as was
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0170800300:301"/>
 then moſt commonly believed. This was very extraordinary and quite wonderful; for his Commiſſioners having juſt before ſent him Word, That Affairs might be managed with the Prince to his Majeſty's Satisfaction, he had ſummoned his Cabinet Council to meet the next Day, at nine in the Morning; tho' he ſeems he intended nothing leſs than to be with them; for he went away that very Night, without ſo much as leaving any Order or Direction behind him. The Lord Chancellor withdrew at the ſame Time, and took the Broad Seal along with him; ſo that all was now in the utmoſt Confuſion, nor is the Conſternation to be expreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon this the Lords, as well Spiritual as Temporal, wrote to his Highneſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> to let him know the King was gone from them and to acquaint him, They would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep Things in Order, till they could receive his Directions, and to invite him to Town.</p>
            <p>The Rabble had been before ſufficiently incenſed againſt the Papiſts, but now appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, and reaſonably enough, That the King had withdrawn himſelf by their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or rather at their Inſtigation, they grew to that Height of Outrage, that riſing in prodigious Multitudes, and dividing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0170800300:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into great Parties, they pulled down  the Chappels of that Worſhip, as well as the Houſes of many of its Profeſſors, taking and ſpoiling their Goods, and impriſoning ſuch as they ſuſpected to be Prieſts: Nor did they ſpare even the Chappels and Houſes of Ambaſſadors, and other foreign Miniſters; and particularly the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, who, as was generally computed, of his own and others, who ſought his Protection, had Goods and Plate to the Value of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Pounds taken from him; what was of leſs Worth, and belonging to that Superſtition, was burnt publickly in the Street. The ſame Day, the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, who had waited too long for the Tide, tho' in the Diſguiſe of a Seaman and deſtitute of his Eye-brows, which he had purpoſely cut off, was ſtopt at <hi>Wapping,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and committed to the Tower by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Lords. He was firſt brought to the Lord Mayor upon Suſpicion only; but being ſoon known, they were obliged to give him a ſtrong Guard, or he had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been torn to Pieces. <hi>Pen,</hi> the great Quaker, a Man of reputed Wit, and much conſulted by the King, with regard to the diſpenſing Power he would unfortunately have uſurped, and the Scheme of Liberty of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0170800300:303"/>
 Conſcience, was taken alſo; as was Father <hi>Peters,</hi> that Incendiary, that Scandal to the Privy Council, where he was the firſt of his pernicious Order that had ſat for many a Year before.</p>
            <p>The King, however, upon his Departure wrote to the general Officers of his Army, ſignifying, That Things being brought to Extremities, and being obliged to ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Queen and the Prince, he was forced to follow himſelf; but hoped it might, at ſome Time or other, pleaſe God to touch the Hearts of this Nation with true Loyalty and Honour. That could he but have truſted to his Troops, he would at leaſt have had one Blow for it; but that tho' there were ſome loyal and brave Men among them, both Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Soldiers, it was their Advice to him not to venture himſelf at their Head, or to fight the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with them. He thanked thoſe for their Fidelity who had been true to him; and added, That tho' he did not expect they ſhould expoſe themſelves, by reſiſting a foreign Army, and a poiſoned Nation, he hoped they would preſerve themſelves diſengaged from Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations and all ſuch evil Doings. In the Poſtcript he told them, That as he had ever found them Loyal, ſo they ever had and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0170800300:304"/>
ſhould find in him a kind Maſter. Lord  <hi>Feverſham,</hi> then commanding as General, diſpatched this Letter to the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range;</hi> and ſent him Word, That having thereby Directions to make no Oppoſition, he had, to prevent the Effuſion of Chriſtian Blood, given Notice of the ſame to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which had thereupon in great Meaſure disbanded.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, in the mean Time, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to forſake the Kingdom, in a Hoy with few of his Attendance, among whom was Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> and ſtretching over from an Iſland in <hi>Kent,</hi> was boarded by a Boat, with thirty ſix armed Men, who were bound, as they called it, a Prieſt-codding, or catching. They uſed the King, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that were with him, with great Rudeneſs and Incivility, and took from his Majeſty three hundred Guinea's, all he was at that Time worth, and his Sword: But when they came to underſtand who he was, they offered to reſtore him both, but he would take back nothing but his Sword. Being brought to Shore, he went to Lord <hi>Winchelſea</hi>'s, where he was taken with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fit of Bleeding at the Noſe, which made him very weak and very ſick. Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this being ſent up to the Lords at
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0170800300:305"/>
               <hi>Whitehall,</hi> they ordered four Noblemen, <hi>Aylsbury, Middleton, Yarmouth</hi> and another, with ſome of his Servants to attend him, and carry him Neceſſaries; ſome of the Guards alſo, and Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> waited upon him; but their Orders were to leave it to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's own Choice, either to go or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, it being deemed unfit to put any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon him. Much about the ſame Time, the Lords <hi>Peterborough</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who had been lately converted by Father <hi>Walker,</hi> Maſter of Univerſity College in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> were alſo taken: But the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> being invited to <hi>London,</hi> had reached <hi>Windſor</hi> before he knew the King had been intercepted.</p>
            <p>Before his Highneſs came to Town, he ſent his own People to poſſeſs themſelves of the Tower: He quartered them in and near the Town, and poſted them at <hi>Whitehall;</hi> and at two in the Morning ſent his Majeſty Notice That he muſt remove from thence that Day to ſome Place ten or twelve Miles diſtant, and be attended by his Highneſs's Guards. His Majeſty therefore went to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> attended by Lord <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> Lord <hi>Aylsbury,</hi> and Lord <hi>Arran;</hi> and then the Prince came to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where he was complimented by many of the Nobility;
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0170800300:306" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Bells rang, Bonfires were lighted up,  nor was any public Profeſſion of Joy want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Rabble; while ſerious Men in the City ſeemed to think it hard The King ſhould be ſo forced to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſecond Time.</p>
            <p>The Prince, upon his Arrival, ſeemed more inclined to the Presbyterians than to the Members of the Church, which ſtartled the Clergy; he ordered as many of the King's Forces to be gathered together as poſſible, and confined Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> to <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle for having disbanded them, and for other Matters laid to his Charge; nor muſt we forget, That his Highneſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſo much to himſelf, as to make the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> wait full four Hours before he would give him Admittance. The King, alarmed at this Proceeding, began to think himſelf in Danger, and ſent to the Lords, ſignifying, It was his Deſire to go out of the Kingdom. Their Lordſhips took ſome Time to conſider on the Anſwer they were to make; but while they were in the midſt of their Deliberation, he gratifyed himſelf in his own Deſire, and went private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away. And now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards and other Troops were, by the Prince, ſent to the Diſtance of twenty Miles from <hi>London,</hi>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0170800300:307" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 to make Room for the foreign Soldiery he had brought with him.</p>
            <p>The Lords having for ſome Time ſat in their Houſe, and finding that his Majeſty would not appoint another Chancellor or Keeper, or produce the great Seal, the Lords I ſay, being about ſixty in Number, as well Spiritual as Temporal, Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> being in the Chair, made an Order to baniſh all Papiſts that had not kept Houſe for four Years laſt paſt, to the Diſtance of ten Miles from the City. Their Lordſhips ceaſed not to ſit, tho' it was <hi>Chriſtmaſs-Day;</hi> and among other Things, framed an Addreſs to the Prince, That he would take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on himſelf, till Affairs could be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled; and the next Day a certain Number of Lords were appointed to wait on him therewith; but his Highneſs ſaid, He could give no Anſwer to it, till he had the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Commons; for it was but two Days before that he had ordered the Lord Mayor and fifty of the Aldermen and Common Council, together with all ſuch Gentlemen as had been Members of Parliament in the late Reign, and were in Town, to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Houſe of Commons, to ſit there as a Committee, in Imitation of the Lords. They met accordingly, to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0170800300:308" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of about 300, and voted a Concurrence  with the Lords in moſt Things, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in their Addreſs to the Prince to take the Government upon him till the 22d of <hi>January,</hi> when a Convention was to be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned; the Writs, it ſhould ſeem, that had been iſſued out for the calling of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Elections that had thereupon been made, becoming void and of none Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. All this was tranſacted in the midſt of almoſt a dead Calm, no Miſchief was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, no Diſorders raiſed or fomented, but all was Peace, Acquieſcence, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>

Tho' the Convention met on the 22d,  there was nothing conſiderable done till the 28th, when the Settlement of the Nation being taken into Conſideration, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they voted That King <hi>James</hi> II. hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endeavoured to ſubvert the Government of this Kingdom, by breaking the original Contract between the King and the People; and by the Advice of Jeſuits, and other wicked Perſons, having ſubverted the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, and having laſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf from the Kingdom, had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the Government, and the Throne was thereby vacant.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Feb. 1.</label> In the midſt of this I ſaw Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> in Company with Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> the <hi>quondam</hi> Speaker of the Commons, a Man of great Parts, and much for continuing the Power in the King's Name, and even in his Perſon, could we but be ſecured from the Danger of Popery. Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> alſo was preſent, who with great Violence argued That the Prince
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0170800300:313"/>
 was to be crowned; and urged, That <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> could never be happily ſettled till his Highneſs was at the Helm, and this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſtrict Conjunction with <hi>Holland. Seymour</hi> ſaid his Propoſals were impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for that if the Prince was King, he muſt maintain himſelf as ſuch, by the Means of an Army, which was not to be relyed on againſt their natural Sovereign. He obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That as the late <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army would not fight for Popery, they would be as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in fighting againſt their King; and that it was impoſſible for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to join heartily in one and the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, being Suitors, as they were, to one and the ſame Miſtreſs, namely, <hi>Trade.</hi> That ſame Night my Lord <hi>Halliſax</hi> told me, He was not at firſt in the Secret of the Prince's Expedition; but that as his Highneſs was now with us, and upon ſo good an Occaſion, he thought we were obliged to ſtand by and defend him. I told him, I had heard Lord <hi>Danby</hi> expected to be beforehand with him in the Prince's good Graces; but he gave me ſome Reaſons to make me believe otherwiſe, took Notice that his Lordſhip began to lag in his Zeal; and concluded that the ſaid Lord could have no Hopes of being Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, his Highneſs having declared he would
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0170800300:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have Commiſſioners for the Execution of  that Office. His Lordſhip then proceeded to tell me he himſelf ſhould be employed, and offered to me ſome Arguments to prove the Legality of ſerving under the future Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; particularly that tho' the King had relinquiſhed his Function, the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not for that Reaſon to be ſuffered to fall; that fall it muſt, if Men would not act under thoſe to whom it was delegated; in fine, that in our preſent Circumſtances the <hi>Salus Populi</hi> was to be the <hi>Lex Suprema.</hi> His Lordſhip then continued, That there were ſo many who declined to ſerve, and ſo few who were fit for it, that if I had a Mind to engage myſelf, there would be, doubtleſs, Room ſufficient for me; and that after Things were upon a ſtable Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I might entertain ſome Thoughts of being ſent Ambaſſador to ſome Prince or State, whereby I might be out of the way, till the Clouds which hung over us, were diſperſed and blown away. His Lordſhip then offered to carry me the next Morning to the Prince, whom I had not yet ſeen, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to be cautious of the Company I kept, and to be very circumſpect in all my Actions and Behaviour.</p>

               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0170800300:315" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 The next Day I went to meet the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs, who was with the Prince in his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber; but coming out to me, he told me his Highneſs could not be publickly ſeen of two Hours yet to come; and adviſed me to defer the waiting on him till the next Day. At the ſame Time the Lords, who were for conferring the Crown immediately on the Prince, began to apprehend the adverſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might prevail againſt them; wherefore they found Means to ſtir up the People, who in a tumultuous Manner offered a Petition to the two Houſes of Parliament, That they would crown both the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> and take ſpeedy Care of Liberty and Property, as well as for the Defence of <hi>Ireland:</hi> But the Lords rejected it, becauſe it was not ſigned; and the Commons did the ſame, ſaying, They would not be awed in their Votes, nor be directed; for that they ought to be free. The very ſame Day the King ſent two Letters, the one to the Lords, the other to the Commons; but the Meſſenger not being preſent to teſtify they were brought from the King, they were laid by, and the Perſon who brought them was ordered to attend on the Lords the <hi>Monday</hi> Morning next. At this very Juncture I was told, by a Court Lady, That it was much
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0170800300:316" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wondered my Friend, the Marquiſs of <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax,</hi>  had been ſo eager for the King's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abdicated the Government, when he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely knew his Majeſty had never gone, if he had not been frightned into it. She aſſured me his Lordſhip had treated with the King to come again into Buſineſs, a few Weeks before the Prince's Intention was certainly known: That ſhe was the very Perſon his Lordſhip ſent to the King; that the King actually gave him a Meeting at her Houſe: That they had agreed upon Terms; nay, what is more, that his Lordſhip had treated with ſome Prieſts for his Return to Court. That upon this Account his Majeſty particularly depended upon him, when he named him one of the Commiſſioners to go to the Prince; that after having conferred with his Highneſs, he ſent the King a private Letter, intimating an ill Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Perſon, and that this was the real Cauſe of his Majeſty's Flight, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Queen. That after the King was brought back, Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> was one of the Peers that came and admoniſhed him, on Behalf of the Prince, to leave <hi>Whitehall,</hi> for <hi>Rocheſter</hi> or <hi>Ham,</hi> within the ſhort Space of two Hours; and that his Lordſhip's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for conveying this ungrateful Meſſage to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0170800300:317"/>
 his Majeſty, was, That he was aſſured the Prince's Party had in Council reſolved to ſeize on his Perſon, and impriſon him: That upon the whole it muſt be notoriouſly known to his Lordſhip that the King had no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Inclination to withdraw either the firſt or the ſecond Time; and that he was compelled thereto out of a Principle of mere Self-preſervation. She farther imparted to me That the the King was ſo terribly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of his Danger, and ſo deeply afflicted when the Princeſs <hi>Anne</hi> went away, that it diſordered him in his Underſtanding, but that he recovered pretty well upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. She continued, That the ſecond Time he went away he ſo little deſigned any ſuch Thing, that he knew not which way to ſet forward; one while he reſolved to go north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and throw himſelf into the Hands of the Lord <hi>Danby;</hi> another, he had Thoughts of going to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> that ſhe herſelf was ſent to theſe laſt, to know if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and ſecure him, and that they neither accepted the Motion, nor rejected it. She told me moreover, That the Lords intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make Uſe of the Marquiſs for the Prince's Service, but were far from intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him any Advantage thereby: That his
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0170800300:318"/>
Lordſhip having been the firſt that adviſed  the taking away of the Charters, he would be in ſome Danger of being called to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, as ſoon as the Government was well ſettled; as well as for other Articles, he having great Enemies among the Party to which he adhered; at laſt ſhe deſired me if poſſible ſo to contrive that ſhe might ſpeak to his Lordſhip, and endeavour to moderate him ſo far as to make him think well of a Regency, and not hurry on ſo faſt for a Forfeiture or Abdication. I told her I would do what I could in it; but was ſenſible his Lordſhip was too far engaged to recede. The ſame Lady again told me a great Lord of <hi>Scotland</hi> had, but a few Days before, aſſured her, That in Caſe the two Houſes agreed to make the Government vacant, that Kingdom would chuſe for herſelf, be no more a Province to <hi>England,</hi> nor give no longer Attendance at the Door of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>The Lords this Day did nothing more than order the 8th of <hi>February,</hi> which uſed to be kept as the Anniverſary of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Acceſſion, to be no longer obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Feſtival; and ſent down their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to the Commons concerning the Abdication and other Matters thereto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating: Which the Commons, the Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

During which, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards told me ſhe was ſo free with him as to ſay, She wondered he, of all Men living, ſhould contend that the King had abdicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he knew himſelf to have been ſo directly inſtrumental in forcing him away, by ſending him Word, That if he ſtaid his Life would be in Danger; that for this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Advice the King owned himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him for his Life now, as before that he was not excluded: That to this his Lordſhip replyed, The King had done ill by him, in ſending him a Meſſenger to the Prince, and going away before he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: That to this ſhe returned, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was not to ſay that to her, who actually knew he firſt ſent him away, and was then angry becauſe he went: That then my Lord complained to her of the King's never ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him till the Prince was landed: That this alſo ſhe contradicted by obſerving that his Lordſhip knew her to be privy to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Invitations he had from the King, and that he might have had his own Terms long before, if he had not ſtood ſo aloof:
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0170800300:322"/>
That ſhe then remonſtrated to him that  though he was ſo deeply at preſent imbark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in another Intereſt, he could not be well too cautious; for that the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> would moſt certainly get the Start of him, and play him the ſame Game in this Court, Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> had in the other; that all they were now doing tottered upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Foundation; that <hi>Scotland</hi> would moſt aſſuredly chuſe her own King; that <hi>Ireland</hi> was probably loſt and gone, the Lord Deputy <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> being there at the Head of an Army of 40000 Men; and that <hi>England</hi> herſelf was much divided, and in great Diſtraction, with much more to the ſame Effect; That his Lordſhip himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed there were but ſmall Hopes of a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace from this Settlement, tho' by far the beſt that could be formed at this Time of the Day; and that as he was well aware of the great Intereſt ſhe had with the King, he hoped ſhe would upon Occaſion be his Friend, as he would be hers whenever ſhe might ſtand in Need of him. The Truth is, ſhe dealt more roundly with him than any Body elſe could have ventured to do with ſo great a Man; but his Lordſhip knew her well, and was prepared for all ſhe had to ſay;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0170800300:323" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 telling me himſelf, it was but Prudence to lend an Ear to every Body.</p>
            <p>There were moſt certainly great and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diſcontents at this Time, and the Cauſes thereof were theſe; The Prince had declared he had no Deſign upon the Crown, and now ſought it all he could; he came to ſettle the Proteſtant Religion, and yet brought over 4000 Papiſts with him in his Army, a Number not far ſhort of what the King had in his, but then the former were Foreigners, the latter, for the moſt Part, <hi>Engliſh;</hi> public Declaration had been made that the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was falſe or ſuppoſitious; that there was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Treaty made with <hi>France</hi> to inſlave <hi>England,</hi> that the Murder of the late King and of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> would be amply made out; and yet nothing of all this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, excepting ſome ſmall Circumſtances relating to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> Then the Prince kept his <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces in Town, while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were marched off to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Quarters; his Highneſs declared he intended to keep his own Men here, and to ſend ours to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> was poſt-poned in the Succeſſion; ſeveral Noblemen were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

            <p>The Days following, the Houſes being adjourned for ſome Time, were taken up in Congratulations to the new King, whoſe Numbers, on this Occaſion, were unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; in naming and ſwearing a new privy Council; by whoſe Advice his Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt with appointing the great Officers of the Court and the Kingdom; while the grand Expectation was, who would have the Preference <hi>Hallifax</hi> or <hi>Danby.</hi> The latter certainly hoped to be Lord Treaſurer; but the former aſſured me he was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and obliged to take up with the Preſidency of the Council, a Place of great Honour and Credit, but very ſmall Profit; while <hi>Hallifax</hi> himſelf was made Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Seal, of his own Choice, an Office of great Truſt, and worth full three thouſand Pounds a Year. Before this was publickly known, his Lordſhip told me <hi>Danby</hi> was down in the Mouth, and would not ſuffer his Neighbours to be a little quiet about him, and that for his own Part, as they yet
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0170800300:327" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ſtood ſeemingly fair together, he would give him no juſt Occaſion of Offence.</p>
            <p>The King being thus ſeated in the Throne, the great Buſineſs was to procure ſuch a Parliament as would confirm what the Convention had done; and becauſe a new Election might carry ſome Hazard with it, or, as was pretended, might be the Loſs of Time, when the Exigencies of the State required ſuch immediate Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, it was, after great Diſputes between the Lawyers as to the Legality of the Thing, and warm Debates in both Houſes agreed That the Convention ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>Feb. 23.</label> into a Parliament; which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done by a Bill framed for that Purpoſe, which having firſt paſſed the Houſe of Lords, was tranſmitted down to the Commons, who having paſſed the ſame, it was at length offered to the Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which was granted of Courſe.</p>
            <p>And thus was a Parliament obtained, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an extraordinary Manner it muſt be confeſſed, but being thus conſtituted they proceeded to prepare ſeveral Bills, and particularly one for a Comprehenſion, and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>28</label> another for the Toleration of Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, which being moved by Lord <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> in the Houſe of Peers, was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0170800300:328" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by ſome Biſhops, tho' more out of  Fear than Inclination; and a third for the raiſing of 400,000 Pounds by a Tax upon Land.</p>
            <p>And now Lord <hi>Arran,</hi> who had been a little before aſſaulted in <hi>Leiceſter-Fields</hi> by eight Ruffians, and had, at a Meeting of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility in <hi>London,</hi> propoſed to recall King <hi>James,</hi> was committed Priſoner to the Tower, and many of the ſame No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility being on the Point of ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the Convention in their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, were ſtopped. The ſame Day, I dined with the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> who treated me with more Intimacy and Freedom than I expected; his Lordſhip ſaid He had made a fair Report of me to the King, when he gave him an Account of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal of <hi>York;</hi> but I found him extremely cooled with regard to Affairs, as now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged. He ſaid that being embarked with his All, he was ſorry to ſee Things no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conducted; that <hi>Ireland</hi> was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner become invincible by our Neglect of ſending Forces thither before now; that with regard to this, and other material Points, equally unheeded, he had been preſſing with the King to a Degree even of Incivility; that he had told his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0170800300:329" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 He plainly ſaw he did all he could to encourage the Presbyterians and to diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Church, which could not but be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely prejudicial both to himſelf and the Government; tho' he at the ſame Time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that his Majeſty interfered but little in Councils, being prevented therefrom partly by Inclination, and partly by want of Health. Indeed the King looked but ill, and the Difficulty he laboured under in ſwallowing, ſeemed to foretel him a Man of ſhort Continuance in this World. His Lordſhip farther told me He had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Preſident of the Council quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will, after the King had declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he could not give him the Staff of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, determined, as he was, that the Treaſury ſhould be in the Hands of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; that he had been offered to be Secretary of State and Preſident both at the ſame Time, and that he had declined the firſt; that all he had asked of the King for himſelf, was a Patent to which he had a Right by a former Grant, and that he would alſo be pleaſed to gratify ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who had, upon this Revolution, joined him in the North; in fine, that the King had told him It would be by no Means for his Intereſt to be out of all Buſineſs; and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0170800300:330" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he had, in a Manner, forced the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentſhip  upon him, His Lordſhip expreſſed himſelf doubtful of the Continuance of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as they now ſtood, and informed me That King <hi>James</hi> had ſent down to him in the North, offering to throw himſelf into his Hands before he went away. To this, he ſaid, his Anſwer was, by <hi>Charles Bertie</hi> who brought the Meſſage, That his own Force, which he depended upon in the North, was not ſufficient to truſt to; but that if his Majeſty would bring a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Party with him, and come without his Papiſts, he would ſooner loſe his Life than he ſhould ſuffer the leaſt Injury; but that the King having no Mind to part with his Romans, would not come. His Lordſhip then ſaid That if the King would but quit his Papiſts, it might poſſibly not be too late yet for him. He then obſerved That the Duke of <hi>Gordon,</hi> a Papiſt, and Governor of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Caſtle, the only Magazine in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was lately ready and willing to ſurrender it to any Body, now held it out obſtinately for King <hi>James;</hi> and that the Diſcontents in <hi>England</hi> grew greater daily and greater. He then reflected on Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> the King, and all about him, as moſt ſtrangely infatuated with Notions
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0170800300:331" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 of their own Security; and particularly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted on the laſt mentioned Lord for inſiſting with ſuch Violence, in a Speech of his, That the Prince ſhould be entitled Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Rightful King of this Realm, (which I ſuppoſe the Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> did with a View of continuing the old Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Supremacy, and to obviate all Scruple about taking the new) ſaying it was mere Nonſenſe; for that had the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> been made King, he could never have been deemed our lawful Sovereign, while his Father lived. But his Lordſhip nevertheleſs appeared very ſerious and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent about the Legality of taking the new Oaths, and condemned the Biſhops for their Squeamiſhneſs in that Reſpect, tho' they themſelves had had ſo large a Hand in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about this great and extraordinary Change; and thereupon quoted Lord <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi>'s Speech, who, in the Houſe of Lords, had obſerved That tho' he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the leaſt conſented to this Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but had with all his Might oppoſed the Prince's Acceſſion, as contrary to Law; yet ſince his Highneſs was here, and we muſt owe our Protection to him as King <hi>de facto,</hi> he thought it but juſt and legal to ſwear Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him. I have been the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0170800300:332" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the particulars of this Converſation,  to give the better Inſight into the Thoughts of the greateſt Men upon this Occaſion; tho' I wondered his Lordſhip would venture to be ſo very undiſguiſed with me; but he was ſure I would not betray him, tho' even to Lord <hi>Hallifax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very ſame Day, after ſeveral At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Sort, the Marquiſs of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> now again Lord Privy Seal, preſented me to the King, having before requeſted him that a young Son of mine might have my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and that he might be excuſed from Duty a Year or two, on Account of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation; but his Majeſty thought it an ill Precedent, and would give no Ear to it. Having kiſſed his Hand, I told him I had had the Honour of a Truſt upon me from the late King to the very laſt, having been a Stranger to his Deſigns till I ſaw them in Execution, and that I could not then, in Honour or Juſtice, comply with them; but that I was a firm Proteſtant, and had upon that Account been a Sufferer in my Eſtate, concluding that I ſhould be ſtrictly faithful to my Duty whereſoever I ſerved. My Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> then deſired I might keep my Company without paying any Attendance, to which I ſubjoined, <hi>Sir, If you have reſolved</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0170800300:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>to take away my two Governments of</hi> York <hi>and</hi> Burlington, <hi>I hope you will not expect I ſhould wait on a ſingle Company:</hi> His Majeſty ſaid, <hi>No, He did not expect Attendance from me;</hi> which was all that paſſed.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>March 1.</label> I was told by a Lady whom King <hi>James</hi> had truſted with ſome Seals and Jewels, that his Majeſty had written her Word to put them into the Hands of a certain Perſon he ſent for them. She ſhewed me the Letter, which was dated the 17th of <hi>February New-Stile;</hi> whereby I underſtood that he was to ſet out for <hi>Ireland</hi> as the very next Day, and that he depended upon his old Friends to aſſiſt him in his Cauſe. This Lady told me the <hi>French</hi> King had ſupplyed him with a great Treaſure of Money, and 6000 <hi>Swiſs Proteſtants:</hi> That he intended to go through <hi>Ireland</hi> for <hi>Scotland,</hi> there to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſtead of the propos'd Convention; and that from thence he would march into <hi>England,</hi> and put himſelf entirely into the Hands of the Proteſtant Intereſt: She add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That as ſhe had a Friendſhip for the Lord Privy Seal, ſhe had a Mind to diſcloſe herſelf to him, if with any Safety ſhe ſo might do. I told her I would ſpeak to his Lordſhip that very Night, and let her know farther.</p>

               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0170800300:334" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Having an Opportunity of ſpeaking to  him accordingly, I failed not to be as good as my Word; tho' I muſt own, the Topic being of ſo nice and tender a Sort, I did it with great Caution. However, I gave him plainly to underſtand That the chief Motive which induced the Lady to deſire a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, was to impart to him what might be for his own Good, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Public. Hereupon he began to be more free and open with me than he had hitherto been, on this Chapter; and I told him, in general, that great Deſigns were on Foot; he ſaid He believed it, and that tho' Men ſeemed to be for the preſent Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, as moſt prevalent, it was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcreet to venture too far; that if Matters really were as I had ſaid, it was but ſafe to carry it fair with thoſe in the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and to let ſome People know He ſpoke always with great Reſpect of King <hi>James;</hi> that if we came to Blows, it was uncertain who would ſtrike hardeſt; and that he ſhould be glad to meet the Lady at my Houſe, whenever ſhe pleaſed. But his Lordſhip, however, ſaid all imaginable Care would be taken to ward off any Danger that might threaten us; that an Army of 20000 Men would be preſently raiſed; that all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0170800300:335" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Perſons would be ſecured, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament intending to inveſt the King with a Power to impriſon whom he pleaſed, and to keep them in ſafe Cuſtody till they came to a Tryal; and in fine, that the Parliament would moſt plentifully furniſh the King for the Proſecution of the War. At this Time ſeveral Lords and Gentlemen of both Houſes withdrew to their ſeveral Countries; and I was told That ſome who were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly great Friends to the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, were treating for Terms on the other Side; which I communicated to his Lordſhip, and particularly made mention of ſome he little ſuſpected. Whereupon his Lordſhip ſaid That if King <hi>James</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually driving on at the Rate reported, the Papiſts would certainly contrive ſome how or other to aſſaſſinate or kill King <hi>William,</hi> well knowing what a Task it would be to defend the Crown on the Head of a Woman, with much more to the ſame Effect.</p>
            <p>I waited on Lord <hi>Bellaſſis,</hi> firſt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner of the Treaſury under the late King, who told me that tho' he was himſelf a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, he had been quite averſe to the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which had been taken to promote the Catholic Religion; but that his Council ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had Weight, the Warm-ones having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0170800300:336" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the King That it came from a  Man old and timerous, who having a great Eſtate did not care to run any Hazard of it. He then obſerved That as there was ſuch a Number of great Men combined in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, it was almoſt impoſſible to think the King, being a Papiſt as he was, ſhould ever again be reſtored; but that if he would but be a Proteſtant it would certainly happen in a very ſhort Time. This Lord was very deſervedly eſteemed one of the wiſeſt Men of his Party.</p>

The Commons made ſcarce any Scruple to ſwear; but ſome of the Lords refuſed ſo to do, and a greater Number of Biſhops, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they could not lawfully comply, ſeeing they had before engaged themſelves under Oaths to King <hi>James;</hi> and even thoſe who did comply, did it as a local and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Duty naturally reſulting from the Protection they owed to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> This Day Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> met the Lady I juſt now mentioned to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Letter from King <hi>James:</hi> She dealt very frankly with him, but durſt not tell him all ſhe knew. However he deſired her
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0170800300:337"/>
 to be his Friend if any Alteration of Affairs ſhould by any Means be brought to paſs.</p>
            <p>Now the two Houſes had, ſome Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, voted to ſtand by King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> with their Lives and Fortunes, the Commons had completed the Bill for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tax upon Land, and deliberated on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ways for levying of Money for the Crown, as well to raiſe Men, as to ſupply the Loſs of that Branch of the Revenue called Hearth-Money, which they were, by an Act for that Purpoſe, taking quite away, as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to collect and oppreſſive in its Nature; while the Fears greatly and greatly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed That King <hi>James</hi> was actually in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that <hi>Scotland</hi> would not fail to take his Part; wherefore Commiſſions were given out for the raiſing of 10000 Foot, and twenty Shillings Advance allowed to every Man; but notwithſtanding this Encouragement, and tho' the Colonels were moſt of them Men of Quality and great Intereſt, it was much apprehended the intended Troops would not be eaſily collected together. The <hi>French</hi> King had, for his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, furniſhed King <hi>James</hi> with a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of 14 Men of War, 6 leſſer Frigates, and 3 Fireſhips, all well manned and fitted;

They were angry with this Nobleman for adviſing King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to take away the Charter of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and for oppoſing the Bill of Excluſion: But I told him it was quite fooliſh for Men who had raiſed a new

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0170800300:340" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather to march off in a Body with their  Arms and four Pieces of Cannon, towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> than obey Orders, which were to embark and ſail for <hi>Holland.</hi> Lord Privy Seal doing me the Honour of a Viſit this Day, told me The King had ſent two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe, and one of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, after them; that if the <hi>Scotch</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had done this without Confederacy they were all loſt; but that if any other of our Forces were in the Secret, and under Engagement to join and ſupport them, there might be Danger in the Thing. I now perceived his Lordſhip to be very uneaſy That <hi>Danby,</hi> under Pretence of Illneſs, ſo much abſented himſelf from Buſineſs; and very much diſpleaſed that ſome, very little qualifyed, had ſo wonderfully, by his Means, got into Poſts of Conſequence, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly That <hi>Lord Willoughby,</hi> a very young Man, and quite a Stranger to Buſineſs, ſhould be the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I told his Lordſhip, I wondered much more that Lord <hi>Mordaunt,</hi> who never ſaw a hundred Pounds together of his own, ſhould pretend to be the firſt Commiſſioner of the Treaſury; I then dealt very freely with him as to the apparent Uncertainty of the Times; deſired him to be cautious and Circumſpect,

 and aſſured him I wiſhed his Safety and his Family's, as much as my own. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip then obſerved, among other Things, That the King uſed no Arts; to which I replied, That, in my Opinion, ſome Arts were neceſſary in our Government; I think ſo too, ſaid he, we act a little too plainly.

The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was now furiouſly driven at by ſome in both Houſes, King <hi>William</hi> being ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly a greater Friend to Calviniſm. In the Houſe of Lords it was ſtrongly debated, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>23</label> and particularly by the Lord Privy Seal, which loſt him ſome Credit, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Sacrament ſhould be no longer a Part of the Teſt, as required by the Statute of <hi>Charles</hi> II.; and in the Houſe of Commons it was ſtifly contended That the King in his Coronation Oath ſhould not
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0170800300:343"/>
 particularly bind himſelf to the Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed; but both theſe Points being carried in Favor of the Church, evinced her Intereſt to be ſtronger than any other in Parliament, and would, as it was thought, induce the King to court her a little more than he had done.</p>
            <p>The Affairs of all <hi>Europe</hi> were now ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at a Stand, tho' Preparations were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where making for War; the Empire was muſtering up all her Quota's againſt <hi>France</hi> on the one Hand, and the Turk on the other; <hi>Spain</hi> betrayed a Willingneſs to ſide with the Emperor; <hi>Sweden, Holland,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were ready to do the ſame; while <hi>Denmark</hi> ſeemed to be fixed to a Neutrality. The Pope was ſtill in anger with <hi>France</hi> tho' ſhe did all ſhe could to mollify him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to blow up the Flames of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous War; but this was not to ſerve the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at preſent, his Holineſs thinking the King of <hi>France</hi> was grown too big for his Neighbours, and that therefore Regard was to be had chiefly now for his Temporals; the Church was out of the Queſtion, the World was now uppermoſt, and Conſcience was Puſilanimity and Indolence, according to the known and avowed Maxims of the Roman Creed.</p>

It hapned this Day that I met with the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1689</label> Biſhop of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, who asked if I thought <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>March 28.</label> he might ſafely take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, he being one of the Prelates that had hitherto ſtood out, and were now cited to appear before the Houſe of Lords. I told him it were fitteſt for me to be adviſed by him in ſuch a Caſe, and that certainly his own Conſcience could not but dictate to him right: But I found he was already reſolved, and accordingly he went the next Day and complyed. Mean while the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop was obſtinate in his Refuſal, and would not ſo much as repair to the Houſe of Lords, diſowning the Authority either of the King or the Parliament. The Lords ſent his Grace a Letter admoniſhing him to come to the Houſe; but he wrote to excuſe himſelf, by an Anſwer directed, not to the Lord Privy Seal, or the Speaker of the Houſe of Lords, but to the Lord Marquiſs of <hi>Hallifax.</hi> The Houſe voted this Anſwer to be not ſatisfactory, but thought it unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to purſue the Point too far, ſenſible of the ill Blood that had been ſet on Float, by the late Severity of Uſage toward the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Order. A Day or two afterwards, the Church of <hi>England</hi> carryed a ſecond Vote in the Houſe of Commons, and indeed
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0170800300:345" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 it was high Time for her Sons to exert themſelves, the Diſſenters having not only prevailed that the Oaths meant for her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, ſome Prayers in the Liturgy, and certain Ceremonies ſhould be altered or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with, but a Motion had likewiſe been made that there might be ſome Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the very Creed. In a few Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a very extraordinary Debate aroſe in both Houſes, between the Diſſenters and the Members of the Church; the former puſhing their Act of Comprehenſion and Toleration farther than the latter were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſhould go. They were almoſt equally matched, and ſometimes one carryed a Vote in both Houſes, and ſometimes the other.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>April 1.</label> A Number of Regiments, tho' many of them were unarmed, uncloathed, and in want of Pay to clear off their Quarters, were now ordered to march Northward; it being paſt all Doubt that King <hi>James</hi> was now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and intended for <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' the Kirk Party in the Convention of that Kingdom were for oppoſing him. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was at this Time very ſcarce at Court, and yet great Preparations were daily mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Coronation of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> But tho' Neceſſaries were certainly wanting for the Army, the Court,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0170800300:346" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the due Support of the Government, it  was not that the Parliament was backward in giving, but the Money could not be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoon enough, the City refuſing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any Money upon the Acts that were paſſed; for great Diſcontents were viſible to every Eye, which ſeemed rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe daily than to diminiſh.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>April 7.</label> A few Days afterwards, I ſaw Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Seal, who told me That if the Church of <hi>England</hi> was a Sufferer, ſhe might thank her ſelf for it, her Pretences being too large; that the Commons were ſo ſlow in their Proceedings that it looked as if they thought the whole World was confined to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi> that the King alſo was very dilatory, to the great Hindrance of Buſineſs, tho' Diſpatch could at no Time be ever more required; his Lordſhip continued, That there was a Neceſſity for acting with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fools, that they alone were wiſe who had nothing to do; and moreover, That he had heard there were ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> landed in <hi>Scotland;</hi> that <hi>Scotland,</hi> however, would give them but a cool Reception; that King <hi>James</hi> had nothing to depend on here but the Army, which would be ſo diſpoſed of as to be unable to do any thing for him; and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0170800300:347" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 that if he came not very ſoon, he would be diſappointed of this his only Hope: He concurred with me That the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> had procured the Government of <hi>Hull</hi> as a Place of Retreat where he might make his own Terms in Caſe of a Change of the Times; and aſſured me He was more afraid of the Conſequences of King <hi>William</hi>'s Cough, which increaſed upon him with great Violence, than of any Thing elſe. I muſt confeſs I, upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, temporiſed a little, it being neither ſafe nor prudent to be too open with a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councellor, and ſo great a Miniſter, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as I had been guilty of Freedoms with his Lordſhip to little or no Purpoſe; tho' whenever he asked me my Opinion, I never failed to deal uprightly with him.</p>
            <p>But now let us take a View of the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>April 11.</label> of our new King and Queen, a ſplendid Sight, as uſual. The Proceſſion to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was quite regular, tho' not ſo complete in the Number of Nobility, as at the two laſt Solemnities of the ſame Kind. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Care was had of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who had a Part prepared for them to ſit in, both in the Church and in the Hall. They had Tables ſpread for them at the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0170800300:348" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Banquet, to which I, among other Friends,  had the Honour of being admitted, as well as to be with them throughout the whole of the Shew; ſo that I had a very fair Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeeing all that paſt. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>London</hi> crowned them both, aſſiſted by the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the late Doctor <hi>Burnet,</hi> who preached the Sermon, and two others. A few Days afterwards, being with Lord Privy Seal, the Biſhop of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> came in, and complained heavily of the ſlow Proceedings of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſaying the <hi>Dutch</hi> would clap up a Peace with <hi>France</hi> if they did not mend their Pace; obſerved that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was in the Fault, and expreſſed himſelf as if he thought they meant a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to King <hi>James</hi> by their Method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure. Lord Privy Seal agreed with him in his Sentiments, and added that the Church People hated the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and had rather turn Papiſts than receive the Presbyterians among them; but that on the other Hand theſe were to the full as rank and inveterate againſt thoſe, and would marr all their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by their Inadvertance with Regard to their Bill of Comprehenſion, and their Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timing of other Bills; in ſhort that they would diſguſt thoſe from whom they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0170800300:349" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 for Indulgence. They were both angry with the Commons Addreſs to the King the Day before, deſiring him to ſupport and defend the Church of <hi>England</hi> according to his former Declaration, and to call a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Clergy, which the Biſhop ſaid would be the utter Ruin of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion Scheme. In fine, the Marquiſs took Notice, that, at the Rate we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Government could not but be very ſhort lived.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> was all this while in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Convention of <hi>Scotland</hi> oppoſing him with Might and Main, and declaring the Throne of their Kingdom to be vacant: Preſently after we had Advice that they had voted <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> to be King and Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> converted their Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a Parliament, and invited the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Forces on their Borders to come into their Kingdom, to be ready to aſſiſt them againſt King <hi>James</hi> and his Friends, but at the ſame Time that they had prepared cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conditions, and drawn up a Liſt of certain Grievances, for the King to redreſs and aſſent to; and particularly that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy ſhould no longer have Being in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that the King ſhould, with regard to them, embrace the Presbyterian Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0170800300:350" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Duke of <hi>Gordon,</hi> however, ſtill  kept the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At home the Parliament was taken up with raiſing of Money; and the Commons addreſs the King to declare War with <hi>France,</hi> and promiſe him all the needful Supplies. But great Heats broke out between the two Houſes about the Oath Bill, the Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to excuſe the Biſhops, convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſeveral of them would forfeit their Sees rather than comply; while the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons urged that no Soul ſhould be excuſed. But as widely as they for the preſent differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about this, they concurred in the Bill for the Toleration of all Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The next Day the King gave a favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>April 20.</label> Anſwer to the Addreſs which remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his Promiſes to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and moved him for a Convocation. A Day or two after he returned Anſwer to the Commons Addreſs That he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare War with <hi>France,</hi> telling them he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with their Requeſt, and the rather as the <hi>French</hi> King had in a Manner begun, and aſſured them that whatever Money they gave ſhould be faithfully applied to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired End.</p>
            <p>About this Time a very ſad Accident hapned, which for a while was the Diſcourſe
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0170800300:351" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 of the whole Town; Mr. <hi>Temple,</hi> Son to Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> who had marryed a <hi>French</hi> Lady with 20,000 Piſtoles, a ſedate and accompliſhed young Gentleman, who had lately, by King <hi>William,</hi> been made Secretary of War, took a Pair of Oars, and drawing near the Bridge, leapt into the <hi>Thames</hi> and drowned himſelf, leaving a Note behind him in the Boat, to this Effect, My Folly in Undertaking what I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, whereby ſome Misfortunes have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen the King's Service, is the Cauſe of my putting my ſelf to this ſudden End; I wiſh him Succeſs in all his Undertakings, and a better Servant. A dangerous Thing it is for ſome Conſtitutions to give Way to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and imaginary Notion, but not to digreſs on this melancholy Subject;</p>
            <p>The Parliament proceeded to raiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but upon Terms and Perſons, that gave great Diſſatisfaction. The Poll was quite ſtrict, ſcarce a Soul being exempted therefrom, but ſuch as received Alms, the Houſe conſenting to a Grant of no leſs than four Millions for one Year only. And now Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> told me That the Marquiſs of <hi>Caermarthen</hi>'s Retirement into the Country, his Pretences to be ſick, and his ſo ſeldom appearing at Court inſtilled freſh Jealouſies
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0170800300:352" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of him; That he had heard he ſhould ſay  Things could not long continue thus; That his Relations and Friends were very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in in their Diſcourſe, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was very open; That he found this new Marquiſs had no Mind to be inward or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with him; That he ſuppoſed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might imagine he had kept him at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Treaſurer's Staff; but that imagine what he would, he did not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſerve it; that, of all Men, in the World, the King never would have inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with that Office, nor, indeed, with any other that was very conſiderable, as he would find, if Affairs but held out till <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi> Hereupon I acquainted his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with ſome Grounds that made it ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Preſident was diſcontented. His Lordſhip then continued That for his own Part he found the King very well affected towards himſelf, that his Majeſty did not only carry it fair to him, perſonally, but that from third Hands he had it That the King uſed very kind Expreſſions of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his Back; for that he gave him but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Trouble either on account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or of other People, while the Lord Preſident knew no End of his Importunities. This urged me to ſay, That I did not know
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0170800300:353" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 what his Lordſhip might thereby be a Loſer with the King, but that he gained much with others I was certain; for that it was a common Saying No Lord uſed his good Offices for his Countrymen but the Lord Preſident; and this I obſerved, becauſe the Lord Privy Seal, tho' otherwiſe very kind and free with me, did not eſpouſe my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt as I expected he would. But his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip farther told me That the King being ſo very inacceſſible as he was, and confining himſelf ſo to <hi>Hampton,</hi> when there was ſuch abſolute Need of the moſt ſtirring Action, was the Deſtruction of all Buſineſs. That he had deſired his Majeſty but to lye ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Town, and that his Anſwer was, It was not to be done except his Lordſhip deſired to ſee him dead, which, ſaid my Lord, was a very ſhort Anſwer. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he proceeded to ſay That if the King ſurvived this Summer, which he thought he fairly might, notwithſtanding his conſumptive Diforder, or eſcaped the murderous Hands of the Papiſts, he doubted not but the Government would ſtand firm tho' it devolved to the Queen ſingly; but that however the Concern he had for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily would naturally tempt him to act with all the Moderation that might be; that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0170800300:354" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Conſideration it was he had taken no  great or additional Places, no new Honours, no blue Ribbon, as others had done.</p>
            <p>The next Day I was to go to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, where his Lordſhip was to meet me and preſent me to the King before I went into the Country. His Lordſhip repeated his Promiſes to do for me what he could, but ſaid It would be but Diſcretion to let two or three Months paſs over-head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I preſſed Matters too much, to the End we might the better ſee what was likely to become of Things.</p>
