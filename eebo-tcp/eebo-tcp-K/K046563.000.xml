            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>PERHAPS it may be neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Public, that not long ſince an
Examination of the Fifteenth and Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapters of the Hiſtory of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire was publiſhed
by Mr. Davis. He ſtyles himſelf a Bachelor
of Arts, and a Member of Baliol College in the
Univerſity of Oxford. His title-page is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of war, and in the proſecution of his
religious cruſade, he aſſumes a privilege of
diſregarding the ordinary laws which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
in the moſt hoſtile tranſactions between
civilized men or civilized nations. Some of
the harſheſt epithets in the Engliſh language
are repeatedly applied to the hiſtorian, a part
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0162400600:4"/>
of whoſe work Mr. Davis has choſen for the
object of his criticiſm. To this author Mr.
Davis imputes the crime of betraying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and ſeducing the faith of thoſe readers,
who may heedleſsly ſtray in the flowery paths
of his diction, without perceiving the poiſonous
ſnake that lurks concealed in the graſs. <hi>Latet
anguis in herbâ.</hi> The Examiner has aſſumed the
province of reminding them of <q rend="inline">the unfair
proceedings of ſuch an inſidious friend, who
offers the deadly draught in a golden cup,
that they may be leſs ſenſible of the danger<note n="1" place="bottom">Davis, Preface, p. ii.</note>.
In order to which, Mr. Davis has ſelected
ſeveral of the more notorious inſtances of his
miſrepreſentations and errors; reducing them
to their reſpective heads, and ſubjoining a
long liſt of almoſt incredible inaccuracies:
and ſuch ſtriking proofs of ſervile plagiariſm,
as the world will be ſurpriſed to meet with
in an author who puts in ſo bold a claim to
originality and extenſive reading<note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid. Preface, p. iii.</note>?</q> Mr.
Davis proſecutes this attack through an octavo
volume of not leſs than two hundred and eighty-four
pages with the ſame implacable ſpirit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
charges his adverſary with perverting
the ancients, and tranſcribing the moderns;
and inconſiſtently enough imputes to him the
oppoſite crimes of art and careleſſneſs, of groſs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0162400600:5"/>
ignorance and of wilful falſehood. The Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner
cloſes his work<note n="3" place="bottom">Davis, p. 282, 283.</note> with a ſevere reproof of
thoſe feeble critics who have allowed any ſhare
of knowledge to an odious antagoniſt. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
to pity and to condemn the firſt hiſtorian
of the preſent age, for the generous approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he had beſtowed on a writer who is
content that Mr. Davis ſhould be his enemy,
whilſt he has a right to name Dr. Robertſon
for his friend.</p>
            <p>When I delivered to the world the Firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
of an important Hiſtory, in which I had
been obliged to connect the progreſs of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity
with the civil ſtate and revolutions of
the Roman Empire, I could not be ignorant
that the reſult of my inquiries might offend the
intereſt of ſome and the opinions of others. If
the whole work was favourably received by the
Public, I had the more reaſon to expect that
this obnoxious part would provoke the zeal
of thoſe who conſider themſelves as the
Watchmen of the Holy City. Theſe expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were not diſappointed; and a fruitful
crop of Anſwers, Apologies, Remarks, Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
&amp;c. ſprung up with all convenient
ſpeed. As ſoon as I ſaw the advertiſement, I
generally ſent for them; for I have never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
indeed I have never underſtood, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0162400600:6"/>
ſtoical apathy, the proud contempt of criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm,
which ſome authors have publicly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.
Fame is the motive, it is the reward,
of our labours; nor can I eaſily comprehend
how it is poſſible that we ſhould remain cold
and indifferent with regard to the attempts
which are made to deprive us of the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
object of our poſſeſſions, or at leaſt of
our hopes. Beſides this ſtrong and natural
impulſe of curioſity, I was prompted by the
more laudable deſire of applying to my own,
and the public, benefit, the well-grounded cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of a learned adverſary; and of correcting
thoſe faults which the indulgence of vanity and
friendſhip had ſuffered to eſcape without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
I read with attention ſeveral criticiſms
which were publiſhed againſt the Two laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of my Hiſtory, and unleſs I much deceive
myſelf, I weighed them in my own mind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice and without reſentment. After
I had clearly ſatisfied myſelf that their principal
objections were founded on miſrepreſentation or
miſtake, I declined with ſincere and diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
reluctance the odious taſk of controverſy,
and almoſt formed a tacit reſolution of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
my intentions, my writings, and my
adverſaries to the judgment of the Public, of
whoſe favourable diſpoſition I had received the
moſt flattering proofs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0162400600:7"/>
The reaſons which juſtified my ſilence were
obvious and forcible: the reſpectable nature of
the ſubject itſelf, which ought not to be lightly
violated by the rude hand of controverſy; the
inevitable tendency of diſpute, which ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates
into minute and perſonal altercation;
the indifference of the Public for the diſcuſſion
of ſuch queſtions as neither relate to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
nor the amuſement of the preſent age. I
calculated the poſſible loſs of temper and the
certain loſs of time, and conſidered, that while
I was laboriouſly engaged in a humiliating taſk,
which could add nothing to my own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or to the entertainment of my readers, I
muſt interrupt the proſecution of a work which
claimed my whole attention, and which the
Public, or at leaſt my friends, ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
with ſome impatience at my hands. The
judicious lines of Dr. Young ſometimes offered
themſelves to my memory, and I felt the truth
of his obſervation, That every author lives or
dies by his own pen, and that the unerring
ſentence of Time aſſigns its proper rank to every
compoſition and to every criticiſm, which it
preſerves from oblivion.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have conſulted my own eaſe, and
perhaps I ſhould have acted in ſtricter confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the rules of prudence, if I had ſtill
perſevered in patient ſilence. But Mr. Davis
may, if he pleaſes, aſſume the merit of extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0162400600:8"/>
from me the notice which I had refuſed to
more honourable foes. I had declined the
conſideration of their <hi>literary Objections</hi>; but he
has compelled me to give an anſwer to his <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Accuſations.</hi> Had he confined himſelf to the
ordinary, and indeed obſolete charges of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
principles, and criminal intentions, I ſhould
have acknowledged with readineſs and pleaſure
that the religion of Mr. Davis appeared to be
very different from mine. Had he contented
himſelf with the uſe of that ſtyle which decency
and politeneſs have baniſhed from the more
liberal part of mankind, I ſhould have ſmiled,
perhaps with ſome contempt, but without the
leaſt mixture of anger or reſentment. Every
animal employs the note, or cry, or howl,
which is peculiar to its ſpecies; every man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
himſelf in the dialect the moſt congenial
to his temper and inclination, the moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to the company in which he has lived, and
to the authors with whom he is converſant;
and while I was diſpoſed to allow that Mr.
Davis had made ſome proficiency in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Studies, I ſhould have conſidered the
difference of our language and manners as an
unſurmountable bar of ſeparation between us.
Mr. Davis has overleaped that bar, and forces
me to contend with him on the very dirty
ground which he has choſen for the ſcene of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0162400600:9"/>
our combat. He has judged, I know not with
how much propriety, that the ſupport of a cauſe,
which would diſclaim ſuch unworthy aſſiſtance,
depended on the ruin of my moral and literary
character. The different miſrepreſentations,
of which he has drawn out the ignominious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,
would materially affect my credit as
an hiſtorian, my reputation as a ſcholar, and
even my honour and veracity as a gentleman.
If I am indeed incapable of underſtanding
what I read, I can no longer claim a place
among thoſe writers who merit the eſteem and
confidence of the Public. If I am capable of
wilfully perverting what I underſtand, I no
longer deſerve to live in the ſociety of thoſe
men, who conſider a ſtrict and inviolable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
to truth, as the foundation of every
thing that is virtuous or honourable in human
nature. At the ſame time, I am not inſenſible
that his mode of attack has given a tranſient
pleaſure to my enemies, and a tranſient uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to my friends. The ſize of his volume,
the boldneſs of his aſſertions, the acrimony of
his ſtyle, are contrived with tolerable ſkill to
confound the ignorance and candour of his
readers. There are few who will examine the
truth or juſtice of his accuſations; and of thoſe
perſons who have been directed by their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to the ſtudy of eccleſiaſtical antiquity,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0162400600:10"/>
many will believe, or will affect to believe;
that the ſucceſs of their champion has been
equal to his zeal, and that the <hi>ſerpent</hi> pierced
with an hundred wounds lies expiring at his
feet. Mr. Davis's book <hi>will</hi> ceaſe to be read
(perhaps the grammarians may already reproach
me for the uſe of an improper tenſe); but the
oblivion towards which it ſeems to be haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
will afford the more ample ſcope for the
artful practices of thoſe, who may not ſcruple
to affirm, or rather to inſinuate, that Mr.
Gibbon was publickly convicted of falſehood
and miſrepreſentation; that the evidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
againſt him was unanſwerable; and that
his ſilence was the effect and the proof of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
guilt. Under the hands of a malicious
ſurgeon, the ſting of a waſp may continue to
feſter and inflame, long after the vexatious
little inſect has left its venom and its life in the
wound.</p>
            <p>The defence of my own honour is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
the firſt and prevailing motive which urges
me to repel with vigour an unjuſt and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
attack; and to undertake a tedious
vindication, which, after the perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of the vaineſt and moſt diſguſting
of the pronouns, will only prove that <hi>I</hi>
am innocent; and that Mr. Davis, in his
charge, has very frequently ſubſcribed his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0162400600:11"/>
own condemnation. And yet I may preſume
to affirm, that the Public have ſome intereſt in
this controverſy. They have ſome intereſt to
know whether the writer whom they have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with their favour is deſerving of their
confidence, whether they muſt content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with reading the Hiſtory of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire as a <hi>tale amuſing
enough,</hi> or whether they may venture to receive
it as a fair and authentic hiſtory. The general
perſuaſion of mankind, that where <hi>much</hi> has
been poſitively aſſerted, <hi>ſomething</hi> muſt be true,
may contribute to encourage a ſecret ſuſpicion,
which would naturally diffuſe itſelf over the
whole body of the work. Some of thoſe friends
who may now tax me with imprudence for
taking this public notice of Mr. Davis's book,
have perhaps already condemned me for ſilently
acquieſcing under the weight of ſuch ſerious,
ſuch direct, and ſuch circumſtantial imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Davis, who in the laſt page of his<note n="4" place="bottom">Davis, p. 284.</note> Work
appears to have recollected that modeſty is an
amiable and uſeful qualification, affirms, that
his plan required only that he ſhould conſult
the authors to whom he was directed by my
references; and that the judgment of riper
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0162400600:12"/>
years was not ſo neceſſary to enable him to
execute with ſucceſs the pious labour to which
he had devoted his pen. Perhaps before we
ſeparate, a moment to which I moſt ſervently
aſpire, Mr. Davis may find that a mature judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is indiſpenſably requiſite for the ſucceſsful
execution of <hi>any</hi> work of literature, and more
eſpecially of criticiſm. Perhaps he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
that a young ſtudent who haſtily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
an unknown author, on a ſubject with
which he is unacquainted, cannot always be
guided by the moſt accurate reference to the
knowledge of the ſenſe, as well as to the ſight
of the paſſage which has been quoted by his
adverſary. Abundant proofs of theſe maxims
will hereafter be ſuggeſted. For the preſent,
I ſhall only remark, that it is my intention to
purſue in my defence the order, or rather
the courſe, which Mr. Davis has marked out
in his Examination; and that I have num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
the ſeveral articles of my impeachment
according to the moſt natural diviſion of the
ſubject. And now let me proceed on this
hoſtile march over a dreary and barren deſert,
where thirſt, hunger, and intolerable weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
are much more to be dreaded, than the
arrows of the enemy.</p>

               <q rend="inline">The remarkable mode of quotation which
Mr. Gibbon adopts muſt immediately ſtrike
every one who turns to his notes. He ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
only mentions the author, perhaps the
book; and often leaves the reader the toil

The policy, however, is not without
its deſign and uſe. By endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive

by any quotation, is amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated
by a much greater number, which
contain two, three, or perhaps four diſtinct
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0162400600:14"/>
references; ſo that upon the whole my ſtock
of quotations which ſupport and juſtify my
facts cannot amount to leſs than eight hundred
or a thouſand. As I had often felt the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of the looſe and general method of
quoting which is ſo falſely imputed to me, I
have carefully diſtinguiſhed the <hi>books,</hi> the <hi>chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
the <hi>ſections,</hi> the <hi>pages</hi> of the authors to
whom I referred, with a degree of accuracy and
attention, which might claim ſome gratitude,
as it has ſeldom been ſo regularly practiſed by
any hiſtorical writers. And here I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
ſome obligation to Mr. Davis, who, by
ſtaking my credit and his own on a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſo obvious and palpable, has given me
ſo early an opportunity of ſubmitting the merits
of our cauſe, or at leaſt of our characters, to
he judgment of the Public. Hereafter,
when I am ſummoned to defend myſelf
againſt the imputation of miſquoting the text,
or miſrepreſenting the ſenſe of a Greek or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
author, it will not be in my power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the knowledge of the languages, or
the poſſeſſion of the books, to thoſe readers
who may be deſtitute either of one or of the
other, and the part which <hi>they</hi> are obliged to
take between aſſertions equally ſtrong and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory,
may ſometimes be attended with
doubt and heſitation. But in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0162400600:15"/>
every reader who will give himſelf the
trouble of conſulting the Firſt Volume of my
Hiſtory, is a competent judge of the queſtion.
I exhort, I ſolicit him to run his eye down
the coloumns of Notes, and to count <hi>how many</hi>
of the quotations are minute and particular,
<hi>how few</hi> are vague and general. When he has
ſatisfied himſelf by this eaſy computation,
there <hi>is</hi> a word which may naturally ſuggeſt it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
an epithet, which I ſhould be ſorry either
to deſerve or uſe; the boldneſs of Mr. Davis's
aſſertion, and the confidence of my appeal will
tempt, nay, perhaps, will force him to apply
that epithet either to one or to the other of the
adverſe parties.</p>
            <p>I have confeſſed that a critical eye may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<hi>ſome</hi> looſe and general references; but as
they bear a very <hi>inconſiderable</hi> proportion to the
whole maſs, they cannot ſupport, or even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
a falſe and ungenerous accuſation, which
muſt reflect diſhonour either on the object or
on the author of it. If the examples in which
I have occaſionally deviated from my ordinary
practice were ſpecified and examined, I am
perſuaded that they might always be fairly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to ſome one of the following reaſons.
1. In ſome <hi>rare</hi> inſtances, which I have never
attempted to conceal, I have been obliged to
adopt quotations which were expreſſed with
leſs accuracy than I could have wiſhed. 2. I
may have accidentally recollected the ſenſe of a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0162400600:16"/>
paſſage which I had formerly read, without
being able to find the place, or even to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
from memory the preciſe words. 3. The
whole tract (as in a remarkable inſtance of the
ſecond Apology of Juſtin Martyr) was ſo ſhort,
that a more particular deſcription was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
4. The form of the compoſition ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the want of a local reference; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
mention of the <hi>year</hi> fixed the paſſage of
of the annaliſt, and the reader was guided to
the proper ſpot in the commentaries of Grotius,
Valeſius or Godefroy, by the more accurate cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their original author. 5. The idea which
I was deſirous of communicating to the reader,
was ſometimes the general reſult of the author
or treatiſe that I had quoted; nor was it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to confine, within the narrow limits of a
particular reference, the ſenſe or ſpirit which
was mingled with the whole maſs. Theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
are either laudable or at leaſt innocent.
In two of theſe exceptions my ordinary mode
of citation was ſuperfluous; in the other three
it was impracticable.</p>
            <p>In quoting a compariſon which Tertullian
had uſed to expreſs the rapid increaſe of the
Marcionites, I expreſsly declared that I was
obliged to quote it from memory<note n="7" place="bottom">Gibbon's Hiſtory, p. 551. I ſhall uſually refer to the third edition, unleſs there are any various readings.</note> If I have
been guilty of comparing them to <hi>bees</hi> inſtead
of <hi>waſps,</hi> I can however moſt ſincerely diſclaim
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0162400600:17"/>
the ſagacious ſuſpicion of Mr. Davis<note n="8" place="bottom">Davis, p. 144.</note>, who
imagines that I was tempted to amend the
ſimile of Tertullian from an improper partiality
for thoſe odious Heretics.</p>
            <p>A reſcript of Diocletian, which declared <hi>the</hi>
old law (not <hi>an</hi> old law<note n="9" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 593.</note>), had been alleged by
me on the reſpectable authority of Fra-Paolo.
The Examiner, who thinks that he has turned

that this reſcript could not be <hi>found</hi> in a code
where it does not exiſt, but that it may diſtinctly
be read in the ſame number, the ſame title, and
the ſame book of the CODE OF JUSTINIAN. He
who is ſevere ſhould at leaſt be juſt: yet I
ſhould probably have diſdained this minute ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion,
unleſs it had ſerved to diſplay the
general ignorance of the critic in the Hiſtory
of the Roman Juriſprudence. If Mr. Davis
had not been an abſolute ſtranger, the moſt
treacherous guide could not have perſuaded
that a reſcript of Diocletian was to be found in
the Theodoſian Code, which was deſigned only
to preſerve the laws of Conſtantine and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.

            <p>Few objects are below the notice of Mr.
Davis, and his criticiſm is never ſo formidable
as when it is directed againſt the guilty cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
of the preſs, who on ſome occaſions has
ſhewn himſelf negligent of my fame and of his
own. Some errors have ariſen from the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of letters; from the confuſion of cyphers,
which perhaps were not very diſtinctly marked
in the original manuſcript. The <hi>two</hi> of the
Roman, and the <hi>eleven</hi> of the Arabic, numerals
have been unfortunately miſtaken for each
other; the ſimilar forms of a 2 and a 3, a 5
and a 6, a 3 and a 8, have improperly been
tranſpoſed; Antolycus for Autolycus, Idolatria
for Idololatria, Holſterius for Holſtenius, had
eſcaped my own obſervation, as well as
the diligence of the perſon who was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to reviſe the ſheets of my Hiſtory.
Theſe important errors, from the indulgence
of a deluded Public, have been multiplied in
the numerous impreſſions of three different
editions; and for the preſent I can only lament
my own defects, whilſt I deprecate the wrath of
Mr. Davis, who ſeems ready to infer that I

            <p>The nature of my ſubject had led me to
mention, not the real origin of the Jews, but
their firſt <hi>appearance</hi> to the eyes of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and I cannot avoid tranſcribing the ſhort
paſſage in which I had introduced them.
<q rend="inline">The Jews, who under the Aſſyrian and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
monarchies had languiſhed for many
ages the moſt deſpiſed portion of their
ſlaves, emerged from their obſcurity under
the ſucceſſors of Alexander. And as they
multiplied to a ſurpriſing degree in the Eaſt,
and afterwards in the Weſt, they ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the curioſity and wonder of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note n="5" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 537.</note>.</q> This ſimple abridgment ſeems in its
turn to have excited the wonder of Mr. Davis,
whoſe ſurpriſe almoſt renders him eloquent.
<q rend="inline">
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0162400600:21"/>What a ſtrange aſſemblage,</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline">is
here. It is like Milton's Chaos, without
bound, without dimenſion, where time and
place are loſt. In ſhort, what does this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
afford us, but a deal of boyiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring
to the prejudice of much good hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory<note n="6" place="bottom">Davis, p. 5.</note>.</q> If I rightly underſtand Mr. Davis's
language, he cenſures, as a piece of confuſed
declamation, the paſſage which he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from my hiſtory; and if I collect the
angry criticiſms which he has ſcattered over
twenty pages of controverſy<note n="7" place="bottom">Id. p. 2—22.</note>, I think I can
diſcover that there is hardly a period, or even
a word, in this unfortunate paſſage, which has
obtained the approbation of the Examiner.</p>
            <p>As nothing can eſcape his vigilance, he cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
me for including the twelve tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
under the common appellation of JEWS<note n="8" place="bottom">Id. p. 3.</note>,
and for extending the name of ASSYRIANS to
the ſubjects of the Kings of Babylon<note n="9" place="bottom">Id. p. 2.</note>; and
again cenſures me, becauſe ſome facts which
are affirmed or inſinuated in my text, do not
agree with the ſtrict and proper limits which he has
aſſigned to thoſe national denominations. The
name of <hi>Jews</hi> has indeed been eſtabliſhed by the
ſcepter of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and, in the times
which precede the captivity, it is uſed in the more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0162400600:22"/>
general ſenſe with ſome ſort of impropriety;
but ſurely I am not peculiarly charged with a
fault which has been conſecrated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of twenty centuries, the practice of the
beſt writers, ancient as well as modern (ſee
Joſephus and Prideaux, even in the titles of
their reſpective works), and by the uſage of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
languages, of the Latin, the Greek, and,
if I may credit Reland, of the Hebrew itſelf
(ſee Paleſtin, l. i. c. 6.). With regard to
the other word, that of Aſſyrians, moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
I will not loſe myſelf in the labyrinth
of the Aſiatic monarchies before the age of
Cyrus; nor indeed is any more required for
my juſtification, than to prove that Babylon
was conſidered as the capital and royal ſeat of
Aſſyria. If Mr. Davis were a man of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I might be moroſe enough to cenſure his
ignorance of ancient geography, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
him under a load of quotations, which
might be collected and tranſcribed with very
little trouble: But as I <hi>muſt</hi> ſuppoſe that he
has received a claſſical education, I might have
expected him to have read the firſt book of
Herodotus, where that hiſtorian deſcribes, in
the cleareſt and moſt elegant terms, the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and greatneſs of Babylon: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

(Clio, c. 178.) I may be ſurpriſed
that he ſhould be ſo little converſant with the
Cyropoedia of Xenophon, in the whole courſe
of which the King of Babylon, the adverſary
of the Medes and Perſians, is repeatedly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

               </gap>
(l. ii. p. 102, 103, Edit. Hutchinſon.) But
there remains ſomething more: and Mr. Davis
muſt apply the ſame reproaches of <hi>inaccuracy,</hi>
               <hi>if not ignorance,</hi> to the Prophet Iſaiah, who,
in the name of Jehovah, announcing the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
of Babylon and the deliverance of Iſrael,
declares with an oath; <q rend="inline">And as I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the thing ſhall ſtand: to cruſh the
ASSYRIAN in my land, and to trample him
on my mountains. Then ſhall his yoke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from off them; and his burthen ſhall
be removed from off their ſhoulders.</q> (Iſaiah,
xiv. 24, 25. Lowth's new tranſlation. See
likewiſe the Biſhop's note, p. 98.)</p>
            <p>The jealouſy which Mr. Davis affects for the
honour of the Jewiſh people will not ſuffer him
to allow that they were <hi>ſlaves</hi> to the conquerors
of the Eaſt; and while he acknowledges that
they were tributary and dependent, he ſeems
deſirous of introducing, or even inventing,
ſome milder expreſſion of the ſtate of vaſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0162400600:24"/>
and <hi>ſubſervience</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Davis. p. 6.</note>; from whence Tacitus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the words of <hi>deſpectiſſima pars ſervientium.</hi>
Has Mr. Davis never heard of the diſtinction
of civil and political ſlavery? Is he ignorant
that even the natural and victorious ſubjects of
an Aſiatic deſpot have been deſervedly marked
with the opprobrious epithet of ſlaves by every
writer acquainted with the name and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of freedom? Does he not know that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch a government, the yoke is impoſed
with double weight on the necks of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
as the rigour of tyranny is aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by the abuſe of conqueſt. From the
firſt invaſion of Judaea by the arms of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians,
to the ſubverſion of the Perſian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
by Alexander, there elapſed a period
of above four hundred years, which included
about twelve ages or generations of the human
race. As long as the Jews aſſerted their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence,
they repeatedly ſuffered every ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
which the rage and inſolence of a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
enemy could inflict; the throne of David
was overturned, the temple and city were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to aſhes, and the whole land, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
perhaps unparalleled in hiſtory, remained
three-ſcore and ten years without inhabitants,
and without cultivation. (2 Chronicles, xxxvi.
21.) According to an inſtitution which has
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0162400600:25"/>
long prevailed in Aſia, and particularly in the
Turkiſh government, the moſt beautiful and
ingenious youths were carefully educated in
the palace, where ſuperior merit ſometimes
introduced theſe fortunate <hi>ſlaves</hi> to the favour
of the conqueror, and to the honours of the
ſtate. (See the book and example of Daniel.)
The reſt of the unhappy Jews experienced the
hardſhips of captivity and exile in diſtant lands,
and while individuals were oppreſſed, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſeemed to be diſſolved or annihilated. The
gracious edict of Cyrus was offered to all thoſe
who worſhipped the God of Iſrael in the temple
of Jeruſalem; but it was accepted by no more
than forty-two thouſand perſons of either ſex
and of every age, and of theſe about thirty
thouſand derived their origin from the Tribes
of Judah, of Benjamin, and of Levi. (See Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
i. Nehemiah, vii. and Prideaux's Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
vol. i. p. 107. fol. Edit. London, 1718.)
The inconſiderable band of exiles, who returned
to inhabit the land of their fathers, cannot be
computed as the hundred and fiftieth part of
the mighty people, that had been numbered by
the impious raſhneſs of David. After a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,
which did not comprehend the Tribes of
Levi and Benjamin, the Monarch was aſſured
that he reigned over <hi>one million five hundred and
ſeventy thouſand men</hi> that drew ſword (2 Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0162400600:26"/>
xxi. 1—6), and the country of Judaea
muſt have contained near ſeven millions of free
inhabitants. The progreſs of reſtoration is
always leſs rapid than that of deſtruction; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
which had been ruined in a few
months, was rebuilt by the ſlow and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
labours of a whole century; and the
Jews, who gradually multiplied in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſeats, enjoyed a ſervile and precarious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
which depended on the capricious will
of their maſter. The books of Ezra and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah
do not afford a very pleaſing view of
their ſituation under the Perſian Empire; and
the book of Eſther exhibits a moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
inſtance of the degree of eſtimation in
which they were held at the Court of Suſa. A
Miniſter addreſſed his King in the following
words, which may be conſidered as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
on the <hi>deſpectiſſima pars ſervientium</hi> of
the Roman hiſtorian; <q rend="inline">And Haman ſaid to
King Ahaſuerus, there is a certain people
ſcattered abroad, and diſperſed among the
people in all the provinces of thy kingdom;
and their laws are diverſe from all people,
neither keep they the King's laws; therefore
it is not for the King's profit to ſuffer them.
If it pleaſe the King let it be written that
they may be deſtroyed; and I will pay ten
thouſand talents of ſilver to the hands of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0162400600:27"/>
thoſe that have the charge of the buſineſs to
bring it to the King's treaſuries. And the
King took his ring from his hand, and gave
it to Haman, the ſon of Hammedatha the
Agagite, the Jews enemy. And the King
ſaid unto Haman, The ſilver is given unto
thee: the people alſo, to do with them as
it ſeemeth good to thee.</q>  (Eſther, iii. 8—11.)
This trifling favour was aſked by the Miniſter,
and granted by the Monarch, with an eaſy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
which expreſſed their contempt for
the lives and fortunes of the Jews; the buſineſs
paſſed without difficulty through the forms of
office; and had Eſther been leſs lovely, or leſs
beloved, a ſingle day would have conſummated
the univerſal ſlaughter of a ſubmiſſive people,
to whom no legal defence was allowed, and
from whom no reſiſtance ſeems to have been
dreaded. I am a ſtanger to Mr. Davis's poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
principles; but I ſhould think that the
epithet of <hi>ſlaves,</hi> and of <hi>deſpiſed</hi> ſlaves, may,
without injuſtice, be applied to a captive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
over whoſe heads the ſword of tyranny
was ſuſpended by ſo ſlender a thread.</p>
            <p>The policy of the Macedonians was very
different from that of the Perſians; and yet
Mr. Davis, who reluctantly confeſſes that the
Jews were oppreſſed by the former, does not
underſtand how long they were favoured and

revolutions which divided the empire of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,
Judaea, like the other provinces, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
the tranſient ravages of an advancing
or retreating enemy, who led away a multitude
of captives. But in the age of Joſephus, the
Jews ſtill enjoyed the privileges granted by the
Kings of Aſia and Egypt, who had fixed nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
colonies of that nation in the new cities
of Alexandria, Antioch, &amp;c. and placed them
in the ſame honourable condition (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

as the Greeks and Macedonians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
(Joſeph. Antiquat. l. xii. c. 1. 3.
p. 585. 596. Vol. i. edit. Havercamp.) Had
they been treated with leſs indulgence, their
ſettlement in thoſe celebrated cities, the ſeats of
commerce and learning, was enough to introduce
them to the knowledge of the world, and to juſtify
my <hi>abſurd</hi> propoſition, that they emerged from
obſcurity under the ſucceſſors of Alexander.</p>
            <p>Under the reign of thoſe princes who oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
the interval between Alexander and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,
the Jews aſſerted their civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
rights againſt Antiochus Epiphanes, who
had adopted new maxims of tyranny, and the age
of the Machabees is perhaps the moſt glorious
period of the Hebrew annals. Mr. Davis,
who on this occaſion is bewildered by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety
of Tacitus, does not comprehend why
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0162400600:29"/>
the hiſtorian ſhould aſcribe the independence
of the Jews to three <hi>negative</hi> cauſes, <q rend="inline">Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donibus

et Romani procul aberant.</q> To the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the critic, Tacitus might as well
have obſerved that the Jews were not deſtroyed
by a plague, a famine, or an earthquake; and
Mr. Davis cannot ſee, for his own part, any
reaſon why they might not have elected Kings
of their own two or three hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note n="3" place="bottom">Davis, p. 8.</note>. Such indeed was not the reaſon of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus;
he probably conſidered that every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
depreſſed by the weight of a foreign
power, naturally riſes towards the ſurface, as
ſoon as the preſſure is removed; and he
might think that, in a ſhort and rapid hiſtory
of the independence of the Jews, it was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for him to ſhew that the obſtacles did not
exiſt, which, in an earlier or in a later period,
would have checked their efforts. The curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reader, who has leiſure to ſtudy the Jewiſh
and Syrian hiſtory, will diſcover that the
throne of the Aſmonaean Princes was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the two great victories of the Parthians
over Demetrius Nicator, and Antiochus Sidetes
(See Joſeph. Antiquitat. Jud. l. xiii. c. 5, 6.
8, 9. Juſtin, xxxvi. 1. xxxviii. 10. with Uſher
and Prideaux, before Chriſt 141 and 130); and
the expreſſion of Tacitus, the more cloſely it is

criticiſm<note n="5" place="bottom">Davis, p. 10, 11. 20.</note>, as well as the Text of this ſhort,
but obnoxious paſſage. He corrects the error
of my memory, which had ſuggeſted <hi>ſervitutis</hi>
inſtead of <hi>ſervientium</hi>; and ſo natural is the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
between truth and moderation, that on
this occaſion he forgets his character, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
acquits me of any malicious deſign to
miſrepreſent the words of Tacitus. The other
references, which are contained in the firſt and
ſecond Notes of my Fifteenth Chapter, are
connected with each other, and can only be
miſtaken after they have been forcibly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
The ſilence of Herodotus is a fair evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the obſcurity of the Jews, who had
eſcaped the eyes of ſo curious a traveller. The
Jews are firſt mentioned by Juſtin, when he
relates the ſiege of Jeruſalem by Antiochus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detes;
and the conqueſt of Judaea, by the
arms of Pompey, engaged Diodorus and Dion
to introduce that ſingular nation to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
of their readers. Theſe epochs,
which are within ſeventy years of each other,
mark the age in which the Jewiſh people,
emerging from their obſcurity, began to act a
part in the ſociety of nations, and to excite
the curioſity of the Greek and Roman hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.
For that purpoſe only, I had appealed
to the authority of Diodorus Siculus, of Juſtin,
or rather of Trogus Pompeius, and of Dion

muſt have directed my inquiries to the Sacred
Books, which, even as human productions,
would deſerve to be ſtudied as one of the moſt
curious and original monuments of the Eaſt.</p>

            <p>In ſpeaking of the danger of idolatry, I had
quoted the pictoreſque expreſſion of Tertullian,
<q rend="inline">Recogita ſylvam et quantae latitant ſpinae,</q>

haſtily, though naturally, added <hi>de Idololatria,</hi>

And now let me aſk in my turn, whether Mr.
Davis had any real knowledge of the paſſage
which I had miſplaced, or whether he made an
ungenerous uſe of his advantage, to inſinuate
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0162400600:32"/>
that I had invented or perverted the words of
Tertullian? Ignorance is leſs criminal than
malice, and I ſhall be ſatisfied if he will plead
guilty to the milder charge.</p>
            <p>The ſame obſervation may be extended to a
paſſage of Le Clerc, which aſſerts, in the
cleareſt terms, the ignorance of the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

Clerc lay open before me, but while my eye
moved from the book to the paper, I tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed

            <p>The <hi>infernal</hi> picture, which I had produced<note n="1" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 566.</note>
from that vehement writer, which excited the

furniſhed him with a few critical cavils<note n="2" place="bottom">Davis, p. 29—33.</note>.
Happy ſhould I think myſelf, if the materials
of my Hiſtory could be always expoſed to the
Examination of the Public; and I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0162400600:33"/>
myſelf with appealing to the impartial
Reader, whether my Verſion of this Paſſage is
not as fair and as faithful as the more literal
tranſlation which Mr. Davis has exhibited in
an oppoſite column. I ſhall only juſtify two
expreſſions which have provoked his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
1. I had obſerved that the zealous Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
purſues the infernal deſcription in a long
variety of affected and unfeeling witticiſms;
the inſtances of Gods, of Kings, of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
of Philoſophers, of Poets, of Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
introduced into my Tranſlation. Thoſe
which I had omitted relate to the Dancers, the
Charioteers, and the Wreſtlers; and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible to expreſs thoſe conceits which
are connected with the language and manners
of the Romans. But the reader will be <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently</hi>
ſhocked, when he is informed that Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian
alludes to the improvement which the
agility of the Dancers, the <hi>red</hi> livery of the
Charioteers, and the attitudes of the Wreſtlers,
would derive from the effects of fire. <q rend="inline">Tunc

rota totus ruber. Tunc Xyſtici contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandi,
non in Gymnaſiis, ſed in igne jacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati.</q>
2. I cannot refuſe to anſwer Mr.
Davis's very particular queſtion, Why I appeal
to Tertullian for the condemnation of the
wiſeſt and moſt virtuous of the Pagans? <hi>Becauſe</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0162400600:34"/>
I am inclined to beſtow that epithet on Trajan
and the Antonines, Homer and Euripides,
Plato and Ariſtotle, who are all manifeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
within the fiery deſcription which I had
produced.</p>
            <p>I am accuſed of miſquoting Tertullian ad
Scapulam<note n="3" place="bottom">Davis, p. 35, 36.</note>, as an evidence that Martyrdoms
were lately introduced into Africa<note n="4" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 609, Note 172.</note>. Beſides
Tertullian, I had quoted from Ruinart (Acta
Sincera, p. 84.) the Acts of the Scyllitan Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;
and a very moderate knowledge of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Hiſtory would have informed Mr.
Davis, that the two authorities thus connected
eſtabliſh the propoſition aſſerted in my Text.
Tertullian, in the above-mentioned Chapter,
ſpeaks of one of the Proconſuls of Africa, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellius
Saturninus, <q rend="inline">qui <hi>primus hic</hi> gladium in
nos egit;</q> the Acta Sincera repreſent the
ſame Magiſtrate as the Judge of the Scyllitan
Martyrs, and Ruinart, with the conſent of the
beſt Critics, aſcribes their ſufferings to the
perſecution of Severus. Was it my fault if
Mr. Davis was incapable of ſupplying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate
ideas?</p>
            <p>Is it likewiſe neceſſary that I ſhould juſtify
the frequent uſe which I have made of Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian?
His copious writings diſplay a lively and
intereſting picture of the primitive Church,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0162400600:35"/>
and the ſcantineſs of original materials ſcarcely
left me the liberty of choice. Yet as I was
ſenſible, that the Montaniſm of Tertullian is
the convenient ſcreen, which our orthodox
Divines have placed before his errors, I have,
with peculiar caution, confined myſelf to thoſe
works which were compoſed in the more early
and ſounder part of his life.</p>
            <p>As a collateral juſtification of my frequent
appeals to this African Preſbyter, I had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
in the third edition of my Hiſtory, two
paſſages of Jerom and Prudentius, which prove
that Tertullian was the maſter of Cyprian, and
that Cyprian was the maſter of the Latin
Church<note n="5" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 566. N. 72.</note>. Mr. Davis aſſures me, however,
that I ſhould have done better not to have
<q rend="inline">added this note<note n="6" place="bottom">Davis, p. 145.</note>, as I have only accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
my inaccuracies.</q> One inaccuracy he
had indeed detected, an error of the preſs, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronym.
de Viris illuſtribus, c. 53 for 63; but
this advantage is dearly purchaſed by Mr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis.
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which he produces as
the original words of Cyprian, has a braver and
more learned ſound, than <hi>Da magiſtrum</hi>; but
the quoting in Greek a ſentence which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
and is recorded in Latin, ſeems to
bear the mark of the moſt ridiculous pedantry;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0162400600:36"/>
unleſs Mr. Davis, conſulting for the firſt time
the Works of Jerom, miſtook the Verſion of
Sophronius, which is printed in the oppoſite
column, for the Text of his original Author.
My reference to Prudentius, Hymn. xiii. 100.
cannot ſo eaſily be juſtified, as I preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

to read till they came to a full ſtop. I ſhall

Theſe imputations I ſhall eaſily wipe away, by
ſhewing that, in the firſt inſtance, I am proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in the right, and that in the ſecond, he is
certainly in the wrong.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The conciſe and elegant Sulpicius, who
has been juſtly ſtyled the Chriſtian Salluſt, after
mentioning the exile and Revelations of St.
John in the Iſle of Patmos, obſerves (and
ſurely the obſervation is in the language of
complaint), <q rend="inline">Librum ſacrae Apocalypſis, qui

guilty of ſuppoſing <hi>plerique</hi> to ſignify <hi>the greater
number</hi>; whereas Mr. Davis, with Stephens's
Dictionary in his hand, is able to prove that
<hi>plerique</hi> has not <hi>always</hi> that extenſive meaning,
and that a claſſic of good authority has uſed the
word in a much more limited and qualified
ſenſe. Let the Examiner therefore try to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his exception to this particular caſe. For
my part, <hi>I</hi> ſtand under the protection of the
general uſage of the Latin language, and with
a ſtrong preſumption in favour of the juſtice of
my cauſe, or at leaſt of the innocence and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my intentions; ſince I have tranſlated a
familiar word according to its acknowledged
and ordinary acceptation.</p>
            <p>But, <q rend="inline">if I had looked into the paſſage, and
found that Sulpicius Severus there expreſsly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0162400600:38"/>
tells us, that the Apocalypſe was the work
of St. John, I could not have committed ſo
unfortunate a <hi>blunder,</hi> as to cite this Father
as ſaying That the greater number of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
denied its Canonical authority<note n="9" place="bottom">Davis, p. 270.</note>.</q>
Unfortunate indeed would have been my
blunder, had I aſſerted that the ſame Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
who denied its Canonical authority, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to be the work of an Apoſtle. Such
indeed was the opinion of Severus himſelf,
and his opinion has obtained the ſanction of
the Church; but the Chriſtians whom he taxes
with folly or impiety for rejecting this ſacred
book, muſt have ſupported their error by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
the Apocalypſe to ſome uninſpired
writer; to John the Preſbyter, or to Cerinthus
the Heretic.</p>
            <p>If the rules of grammar and of logic autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
or at leaſt allow me to tranſlate <hi>plerique</hi> by
the <hi>greater number,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of
the fourth century illuſtrates and juſtifies this
obvious interpretation. From a fair compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the populouſneſs and learning of the
Greek and Latin Churches, may I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the former contained the <hi>greater
number</hi> of Chriſtians qualified to paſs ſentence
on a myſterious propheſy compoſed in the
Greek language? May I not affirm, on the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0162400600:39"/>

was generally rejected by the Greek Churches?

but I am called upon<note n="1" place="bottom">By Mr. Davis, p. 41. and by Dr. Chelſum, Remarks, p. 57.</note> to defend my Remark
that the Apocalypſe was tacitly excluded from the
ſacred canon by the council of Laodicea (Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non

only ſtate the fact in a ſimple, but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
manner. The aſſembled Biſhops of Aſia,
after enumerating all the books of the Old and
New Teſtament which ſhould be read in
churches, omit the Apocalypſe, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe
alone; at a time when it was rejected
or queſtioned by many pious and learned Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
who might deduce a very plauſible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from the ſilence of the Synod.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the Council of Trent reſolved to
pronounce ſentence on the Canon of Scripture,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0162400600:40"/>
the opinion which prevailed, after ſome debate,
was to declare the Latin Vulgate authentic and
<hi>almoſt</hi> infallible; and this ſentence, which was
guarded by formidable Anathemas, ſecured all
the books of the Old and New Teſtament
which compoſed that ancient verſion, <q rend="inline">che ſi

reaſon as the moſt powerful argument which
influenced the debates of the Council: But
Mr. Davis, jealous of the honour of a Synod

affirms that Fra-Paolo has given another
more ſubſtantial reaſon on which theſe Popiſh
Biſhops built their determination, That after
dividing the books under their conſideration

had formerly been doubted, but which by
uſe and cuſtom had acquired canonical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and of thoſe which had never been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

            <p>The Italian paſſage which, for that purpoſe,

            <p>I had cautiouſly obſerved (for I was appriſed
of the obſcurity of the ſubject) that the Epiſtle
of Clemens does not lead us to diſcover any
traces of Epiſcopacy either at Corinth or Rome<note n="3" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 592. N. 110.</note>.
In this obſervation I particularly alluded to the
republican form of ſalutation, <q rend="inline">The Church
of God inhabiting Rome, to the Church of
God inhabiting Corinth;</q> without the leaſt
mention of a Biſhop or Preſident in either of
thoſe eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>Yet the piercing eye of Mr. Davis<note n="4" place="bottom">Davis, p. 44, 45.</note> can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
not only traces, but evident proofs of
Epiſcopacy, in this Epiſtle of Clemens; and
he actually quotes two paſſages, in which he
diſtinguiſhes by capital letters the word BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOPS,
whoſe inſtitution Clemens refers to the
Apoſtles themſelves. But can Mr. Davis hope
to gain credit by ſuch engregious triffing?
While we are ſearching for the origin of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0162400600:43"/>
not merely as an eccleſiaſtical title, but
as the peculiar name of an order diſtinct from
that of Preſbyters, he idly produces a paſſage,
which, by declaring that the Apoſtles eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in every place <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
confounds the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> with one or
other of thoſe two ranks. I have neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
nor intereſt to engage in a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
which I had conſidered only in an hiſtorical
light; but I have already ſaid enough to ſhew,
that there are more traces of a diſingenuous
mind in Mr. Davis, than of an Epiſcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the Epiſtle of Clemens.</p>

            <p>Perhaps, on ſome future occaſion, I may
examine the hiſtorical character of Euſebius;
perhaps I may enquire, how far it appears
from his words and actions that the learned
Biſhop of Caeſarea was averſe to the uſe of

of miſrepreſenting the ſenſe of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical

ſo vehemently urged, that he ſeems to have
ſtaked, on the event of the trial, the merits of
our reſpective characters. If his aſſertions are

A ſimple narrative of this fact, in the
relation of which Mr. Davis has <hi>really</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
ſeveral material circumſtances, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
the cleareſt juſtification.</p>
            <p>Euſebius had preſerved an original letter
from Dionyſius Biſhop of Alexandria to Fabius
Biſhop of Antioch, in which the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the circumſtances of the perſecution which
had lately afflicted the capital of Egypt. He
allows a rank among the martyrs to one Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſion,
an Egyptian, who was falſely or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly
accuſed as a companion of robbers.
Before the Centurion he juſtified himſelf from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0162400600:45"/>
this calumny, which did not relate to him:
but being charged as a Chriſtian, he was
brought in chains before the Governor. That
unjuſt magiſtrate, after inflicting on Nemeſion
<hi>a double meaſure of ſtripes and tortures,</hi> gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that he ſhould be <hi>burnt with the robbers.</hi>
(Dionyſ. apud Euſeb. l. vi. c. 41.)</p>
            <p>It is evident that Dionyſius repreſents the
religious ſufferer as innocent of the criminal
accuſation which had been falſely brought
againſt him. It is not leſs evident, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
might be the opinion of the Centurion,
the ſupreme magiſtrate conſidered Nemeſion
as guilty, and that he affected to ſhew, by the
meaſure of his tortures, and by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of his execution, that he puniſhed him,
not only as a Chriſtian, but as a robber.
The evidence againſt Nemeſion, and that
which might be produced in his favour, are
equally loſt; and the queſtion (which fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
is of little moment) of his guilt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
reſts ſolely on the oppoſite judgments
of his eccleſiaſtical and civil ſuperiors. I could
eaſily perceive that both the Biſhop and the
Governor were actuated by different paſſions
and prejudices towards the unhappy ſufferer;
but it was impoſſible for me to decide which of
the two was the moſt likely to indulge his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
and paſſions at the expence of truth.
In this doubtful ſituation, I conceived that
I had acted with the moſt unexceptionable
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0162400600:46"/>
caution, when I contented myſelf with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
that Nemeſion was <hi>accuſed</hi>; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of a public and authentic nature, in
which both parties were agreed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Davis will no longer aſk, <q rend="inline">what poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
evaſion then can Mr. Gibbon have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to, to convince the world that I have
<hi>falſely</hi> accuſed <hi>him</hi> of a groſs miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Euſebius?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. Davis<note n="7" place="bottom">Davis, p. 64, 65.</note> charges me with falſifying
(<hi>falſifying</hi> is a very ſerious word) the teſtimony
of Euſebius; becauſe it ſuited my purpoſe to
magnify the humanity and even kindneſs of
Maxentius towards the afflicted Chriſtians<note n="8" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 693, N. 168.</note>.
To ſupport this charge, he produces ſome part
of a chapter of Euſebius, the Engliſh in his
text, the Greek in his notes, and makes the
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian expreſs himſelf in the
following terms: <q rend="inline">Although Maxentius at
firſt favoured the Chriſtians with a view of
popularity, yet afterwards, being addicted
to magic, and every other impiety, HE ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
himſelf in perſecuting the Chriſtians, in
a more ſevere and deſtructive manner than
his predeceſſors had done before him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If it were in my power to place the volume
and chapter of Euſebius (Hiſt. Eccleſ. l. viii.
c. 14.) before the eyes of every reader, I ſhould
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0162400600:47"/>
be ſatisfied and ſilent. I ſhould not be under
the neceſſity of proteſting, that in the paſſage
quoted, or rather abridged, by my adverſary,
the ſecond member of the period, which alone
contradicts my account of Maxentius, has not
the moſt diſtant reference to that odious tyrant.
After diſtinguiſhing the mild conduct which
<hi>he</hi> affected towards the Chriſtians, Euſebius
proceeds to animadvert with becoming ſerverity
on the general vices of his reign; the rapes,
the murders, the oppreſſion, the promiſcuous
maſſacres, which I had faithfully related in
their proper place, and which the Chriſtians,
not in their religious, but in their civil capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
muſt occaſionally have ſhared with the
reſt of his unhappy ſubjects. The Eccleſiaſtical
Hiſtorian then makes a tranſition to <hi>another
tyrant,</hi> the cruel Maximin, who carried away
from his friend and ally Maxentius the prize of
ſuperior wickedneſs; for HE was addicted to
magic arts, and was a cruel perſecutor of the
Chriſtians. The evidence of words and facts,
the plain meaning of Euſebius, the concurring
teſtimony of Caecilius or Lactantius, and the
ſuperfluous authority of Verſions and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,
eſtabliſh beyond the reach of doubt or
cavil, that Maximin, and not Maxentius, is
ſtigmatized as a perſecutor, and that Mr. Davis
alone has deſerved the reproach of <hi>falſifying</hi> the
teſtimony of Euſebius.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0162400600:48"/>
Let him examine the chapter on which he
founds his accuſation. If in that moment his
feelings are not of the moſt painful and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating
kind, he muſt indeed be an object of
pity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A groſs blunder</hi> is imputed to me by this
polite antagoniſt<note n="9" place="bottom">Davis, p. 66.</note>, for quoting under the name
of Jerom, the Chronicle which I ought to have
deſcribed as the work and property of Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius<note n="1" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 673, N. 125.</note>; and Mr. Davis kindly points out the
occaſion of my blunder, That it was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of my looking no farther than Dodwell
for this remark, and of not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his reference. Perhaps the Hiſtorian
of the Roman Empire may be credited, when
he affirms that he frequently conſulted a Latin
Chronicle of the affairs of that Empire; and
he may the ſooner be credited, if he ſhews that
he knows ſomething more of this Chronicle
beſides the name and the title-page.</p>
            <p>Mr. Davis, who talks ſo familiarly of the
Chronicle of Euſebius, will be ſurpriſed to
hear that the Greek original no longer exiſts.
Some chronological fragments, which had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
paſſed through the hands of Africanus
and Euſebius, are ſtill extant, though in a very
corrupt and mutilated ſtate, in the compila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Syncellus and Cedrenus. They have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0162400600:49"/>
been collected, and diſpoſed by the labour and
ingenuity of Joſeph Scaliger; but that proud
Critic, always ready to applaud his own ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
did not flatter himſelf, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
the hundredth part of the genuine Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
of Euſebius. <q rend="inline">Ex eo <hi>(Syncello)</hi> omnia
Euſebiana excerpſimus quae quidem depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendere

Animadverſiones in Graeca Euſebii in Theſauro
Temporum, p. 401. Amſtelod. 1658. While
the Chronicle of Euſebius was perfect and
entire, the ſecond book was tranſlated into
Latin by Jerom, with the freedom, or rather
licence, which that voluminous Author, as well
as his friend or enemy Rufinus, always aſſumed.
<q rend="inline">Plurima in vertendo mutat, infulcit, praeterit,</q>
ſays Scaliger himſelf, in the Prolegomena, p. 22.
In the perſecution of Aurelian, which has ſo
much offended Mr. Davis, we are able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
the work of Euſebius from that of
Jerom, by comparing the expreſſions of the
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory with thoſe of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle.
The former affirms, that, towards
the end of his reign, Aurelian was moved
by ſome councils to excite a perſecution
gainſt the Chriſtians; that his deſign occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0162400600:50"/>
a great and general rumour; but
that when the letters were prepared, and as
it were ſigned, Divine Juſtice diſmiſſed him
from the world. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>From this manifeſt difference I aſſume a right
to aſſert; firſt, the expreſſion of the Chronicle of
<hi>Jerom,</hi> which is always proper, became in this
inſtance neceſſary; and ſecondly, that the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Fathers is ſo ambiguous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct,
that we are at a loſs how to determine
how far Aurelian had carried his intention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

with what view we may ſhrewdly ſuſpect,
when I tell him, that after an accurate peruſal
of the whole ſecond Apology, I can boldly
affirm, that the following inſtance is the only
one that bears the moſt diſtant ſimilitude to
what Mr. Gibbon relates as above on the
authority of Juſtin. What I find in Juſtin
is as follows: "A woman being converted
to Chriſtianity, is afraid to aſſociate with her

leſt ſhe ſhould partake of his ſins. Her
huſband, not being able to accuſe <hi>her,</hi> vents

               </q> Mr. Davis then proceeds
to relate the ſeverities inflicted on Ptolemaeus,
who made a frank and inſtant profeſſion of his
faith: and he ſternly exclaims, that if I take

humanity of Roman magiſtrates, it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on me to produce better evidence than
this.</p>
            <p>His demand may be eaſily ſatisfied, and I need

            <p>In ſtating the toleration of Chriſtianity du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

I had obſerved<note n="3" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 676. N. 133, 134.</note>, that the principal eunuchs
of the palace, whoſe names and offices were
particularly ſpecified, enjoyed, with their wives

moſt deliberate manner, that this pretended
fact, which is aſſerted on the ſole authority,
is contradicted by the poſitive evidence, of Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius.
In both theſe <hi>effirmations</hi> Mr. Davis
is inexcuſably miſtaken.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the ſtorms of perſecution aroſe, the
Prieſts, who were offended by the ſign of the
Croſs, obtained leave of the Emperor, that the
profane, the Chriſtians, who accompanied him
to the Temple, ſhould be compelled to offer
ſacrifice; and this incident is mentioned by
the Rhetorician, to whom I ſhall not at preſent
refuſe the name of Lactantius. The act of
idolatry, which at the expiration of eighteen
years was required of the officers of Dioletian,
is a manifeſt proof that their religious freedom
had hitherto been inviolate, except in the ſingle
inſtance of waiting on their maſter to the

expreſsly pointed out this exception to
their freedom. But the proof of the toleration
which they enjoyed, was built on a different
teſtimony, which my diſingenuous adverſary has
concealed; an ancient and curious inſtruction,
compoſed by Biſhop Theonas, for the uſe of
Lucian and the other Chriſtian eunuchs of the

2. The paſſage of Dion, which I am accuſed
of endeavouring to conceal, might perhaps
have remained inviſible, even to the piercing
eye of Mr. Davis, if <hi>I</hi> had not carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
it in its proper place: and it was in
my power to report it, without being guilty of
any <hi>inconſiderate contradiction.</hi> I had obſerved,
that, in the large hiſtory of Dion Caſſius, Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philin
had not been able to diſcover the name
of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> yet I afterwards quote a paſſage
in which Marcia, the favourite Concubine of
Commodus, is celebrated as the Patroneſs of
the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Mr. Davis has tranſcribed my
quotation, but <hi>he</hi> has concealed the important
words which I now diſtinguiſh by Italics (ch.
xvi. note 106. Dion Caſſius, <hi>or rather his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviator
Xiphilin,</hi> l. lxxii. p. 1206.) The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is fairly made and cautiouſly qualified;
I am already ſecure from the imputations of
fraud or inconſiſtency; and the opinion which
attributes the laſt-mentioned paſſage to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviator,
rather than to the original Hiſtorian,
may be ſupported by the moſt unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
authorities. I ſhall protect myſelf by theſe
of Reimar (in his Edition of Dion Caſſius,
tom. ii. p. 1207. note 34.), and of Dr. Lard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and ſhall only tranſcribe the words of the<note n="7" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 667, n. 107.</note>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0162400600:58"/>
latter, in his Collection of Jewiſh and Heathen
teſtimonies, vol. iii. p. 57.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">This paragraph I rather think to be Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philin's
than Dion's. The ſtyle at leaſt is
Xiphilin's. In the other paſſages before
quoted, Dion ſpeaks of <hi>Impiety,</hi> or <hi>Atheiſm,</hi>
or <hi>Judaiſm</hi>; but never uſeth the word <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
Another thing that may make us
doubt whether this obſervation be entirely
Dion's, is the phraſe, "it is related (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)."
For at the beginning of the reign
of Commodus, he ſays, "Theſe things,
and what follows, I write not from the report
of others, but from my own knowledge and
obſervation." However, the ſenſe may be
Dion; but I wiſh we had alſo his ſtyle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any adulteration.</q> For my own part,
I muſt, in my private opinion, aſcribe even
the ſenſe of this paſſage to Xiphilin. The
<hi>Monk</hi> might eagerly collect and inſert an anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
which related to the domeſtic hiſtory of the
church; but the religion of a courtezan muſt
have appeared an object of very little moment
in the eyes of a <hi>Roman Counſul,</hi> who, at leaſt
in every other part of his hiſtory, diſdained or
neglected to mention the name of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">What ſhall we ſay now? Do we not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the name of Chriſtians in the Hiſtory
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0162400600:59"/>
of Dion? With what <hi>aſſurance</hi> then can
Mr. Gibbon, after aſſerting a fact manifeſtly
<hi>untrue,</hi> lay claim to the merits of diligence
and accuracy, the indiſpenſable duty of an
Hiſtorian. Or can he expect us to credit
his aſſertion, that he has carefully examined
all the original materials<note n="8" place="bottom">Davis, p. 83.</note>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Gibbon may ſtill maintain the character
of an Hiſtorian; but it is difficult to conceive
how Mr. Davis will ſupport his pretenſions, if
he aſpires to that of a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>I almoſt heſitate whether I ſhould take any
notice of another ridiculous charge which Mr.
Davis includes in the article of Dion Caſſius.
My adverſary owns, that I have occaſionally
produced the ſeveral paſſages of the Auguſtan
Hiſtory which relate to the Chriſtians, but he
fiercely contends that they amount to more
than <hi>ſix lines</hi>
               <note n="9" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 634. n. 24.</note>. I really have not meaſured
them: nor did I mean that looſe expreſſion as
a preciſe and definite number. If, on a nicer

that my critical Antagoniſt ſhould ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

            </p>
            <p>A criticiſm of this ſort can only tend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Mr. Davis's total ignorance of hiſtorical
compoſition. The Writer who aſpires to the
name of Hiſtorian, is obliged to conſult a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of original teſtimonies, each of which,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0162400600:61"/>
taken ſeparately, is perhaps imperfect and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.
By a judicious re-union and arrangement
of theſe diſperſed materials, he endeavours to
form a conſiſtent and intereſting narrative.
Nothing ought to be inſerted which is not
proved by ſome one of the witneſſes; but their
evidence muſt be ſo intimately blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that as it is unreaſonable to expect that
each of them ſhould vouch for the whole, ſo it
would be impoſſible to define the boundaries
of their reſpective property. Neither Pliny,
nor Dionyſius, nor Cyprian, mention <hi>all</hi> the
circumſtances and <hi>diſtinctions</hi> of the conduct of
the Chriſtian Apoſtates; but if any of them
was withdrawn, the account which I have
given would, in ſome inſtance, be defective.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought neceſſary to ſay, as
ſeveral of the ſubſequent <hi>miſrepreſentations</hi> of

and this obſervation was juſtified by a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

the Apoſtolical Fathers, publiſhed at Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,

I had already marked the <hi>ſituation</hi>; nor is it

The faith of the Apoſtles confuted the
impious error of the Gnoſtics, which attributed
only the <hi>appearances</hi> of a human body to the
Son of God: and it was the great object of
Ignatius, in the laſt moments of his life, to
ſecure the Chriſtians of Aſia from the ſnares of
thoſe dangerous Heretics. According to the
tradition of the modern Greeks, Ignatius was
the child whom Jeſus received into his arms
(See Tillemont Mem. Eccleſ. tom. ii. part ii.
p. 43.); yet as he could hardly be old enough
to remember the reſurrection of the Son of
God, he muſt have derived his knowledge
<hi>either</hi> from our preſent Evangeliſts, <hi>or</hi> from

               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0162400600:64"/>
1. The Goſpels of St. Luke and St. John
would undoubtedly have ſupplied Ignatius with
the moſt invincible proofs of the reality of the
body of Chriſt, when he appeared to the
Apoſtles after his reſurrection: but neither of
thoſe Goſpels contain the characteriſtic words
of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the important cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
that either Peter, or <hi>thoſe</hi> who were
with Peter, touched the body of Chriſt and
believed. Had the Saint deſigned to quote
the Evangeliſt on a very nice ſubject of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,
he would not ſurely have expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by an inaccurate, or rather by a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
to the juſt reproaches of the Gnoſtics.
On this occaſion, therefore, Ignatius did not
employ, as he might have done, againſt the
Heretics, the certain teſtimony of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Jerom, who cites this remarkable paſſage
from the Epiſtle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans
(See Catalog. Script. Eccleſ. in Ignatio, tom. i.

that it was taken from the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

to have been the Hebrew Goſpel, which
was uſed by the Nazarenes of Beraea, as the

Jerom mentions another Copy of this Hebrew
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0162400600:65"/>
Goſpel (ſo different from the Greek Text),
which was extant in the library formed at Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea,
by the care of Pamphilus: whilſt the
learned Euſebius, the friend of Pamphilus and
the Biſhop of Caeſarea, very frankly declares
(Hiſt. Eccleſ. l. iii. c. 36.), that <hi>he</hi> is ignorant
from whence Ignatius borrowed thoſe words,
which are the ſubject of the preſent Enquiry.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The doubt which remains, is only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he took them from an Apocryphal Book,
or from <hi>unwritten tradition:</hi> and I thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

in proper expreſſions of gratitude. My vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Adverſary is always ready to ſtart from
his ambuſcade, and to haraſs my march by a
mode of attack, which cannot eaſily be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
with the laws of honourable war. The

which Mr. Davis has imputed to me<note n="5" place="bottom">Davis, p. 95—97. 104—107. 114—132.</note>,
are of ſuch a nature, that I muſt indeed be
humble, if I could perſuade myſelf to beſtow a
moment of ſerious attention on them. <hi>Whether</hi>
Moſheim could prove that an abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of goods was not eſtabliſhed among the
firſt Chriſtians of Jeruſalem; <hi>whether</hi> he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

<hi>whether</hi> he cenſured Dr. Middleton with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

<hi>whether</hi> he corroborates the <hi>whole</hi> of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the prophetic office; <hi>whether</hi> he
ſpeaks with approbation of the humanity
of Pliny, and <hi>whether</hi> he attributed the
ſame ſenſe to the <hi>malefica</hi> of Suetonius, and
the <hi>exitiabilis</hi> of Tacitus. Theſe queſtions,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0162400600:67"/>
even as Mr. Davis has ſtated them, lie open
to the judgment of every reader, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
obſervations which I could make, would
be an abuſe of their time and of my own. As
little ſhall I think of conſuming their patience,
by examining whether Le Clerc and Moſheim
<hi>labour</hi> in the interpretation of ſome texts of the
Fathers, and particularly of a paſſage of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,
which ſeem to favour the pretenſions of
the Roman Biſhop. The material part of the
paſſage of Irenaeus conſiſts of about <hi>four lines</hi>;
and in order to ſhew that the interpretations of
Le Clerc and Moſheim are not <hi>laboured,</hi> Mr.
Davis abridges them as much as poſſible in the
ſpace of <hi>twelve pages.</hi> I know not whether the
peruſal of my Hiſtory will juſtify the ſuſpicion
of Mr. Davis, that I am ſecretly inclined to
the intereſt of the Pope: but I cannot diſcover
how the Proteſtant cauſe can be affected, if Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus
in the ſecond, or Palavicini in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
century, were tempted, by any private
views, to countenance in their writings the
ſyſtem of eccleſiaſtical dominion, which has been
purſued in every age by the aſpiring Biſhops of
the Imperial city. Their conduct followed the
revolutions of the Chriſtian Republic, but the
ſame ſpirit animated the haughty breaſts of
Victor the Firſt, and of Paul the Fifth.</p>
            <p>There ſtill remain one or two of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Miſrepreſentations, which appear, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0162400600:68"/>
indeed only appear, to merit a little more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
In ſtating the opinion of Moſheim
with regard to the progreſs of the Goſpel, Mr.
Davis boldly declares, <q rend="inline">that I have <hi>altered the
truth</hi> of Moſheim's hiſtory, that I might
have an opportunity of contradicting the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and wiſhes of the Fathers<note n="6" place="bottom">Davis, p. 127.</note>.</q> In other
words, I have been guilty of uttering a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
falſehood.</p>
            <p>I had endeavoured to mitigate the ſanguine
expreſſion of the Fathers of the ſecond century,
who had too haſtily diffuſed the light of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
over every part of the globe, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
as an undoubted fact, <q rend="inline">that the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians
of Scythia and Germany, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the Roman Monarchy, were involved
in the errors of Paganiſm; and that even
the conqueſt of Iberia, of Armenia, or of
Aethiopia, was not attempted with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſucceſs, till the ſcepter was in the
hands of an orthodox Emperor<note n="7" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 611, 612.</note>.</q> I had
referred the curious reader to the fourth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
of Moſheim's General Hiſtory of the
Church: Now Mr. Davis has diſcovered, and
can prove, from that excellent work, <q rend="inline">that
Chriſtianity, not long after its firſt riſe, had
been introduced into the leſs as well as
greater Armenia; that part of the Goths,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0162400600:69"/>
who inhabited Thracia, Maeſia, and Dacia,
had received the Chriſtian religion long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this century; and that Theophilus, their
Biſhop, was preſent at the Council of
Nice<note n="8" place="bottom">Davis, p. 126, 127.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On this occaſion, the reference was made to
a popular work of Moſheim, for the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the reader, that he might obtain the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
view of the progreſs of Chriſtianity in the
fourth century, which I had gradually acquired
by ſtudying with ſome care the Eccleſiaſtic
Antiquities of the Nations beyond the limits of
the Roman Empire. If I had reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that the reſult of our common inquiries
muſt be the ſame, ſhould I have deſerved a
very harſh cenſure for my unſuſpecting confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?
Or if I had declined the invidious taſk
of ſeparating a few immaterial errors, from a
juſt and judicious repreſentation, might not
my reſpect for the name and merit of Moſheim,
have claimed ſome indulgence? But I diſdain
thoſe excuſes, which only a candid adverſary
would allow. I can meet Mr. Davis on the
hard ground of controverſy, and retort on his
own head the charge of concealing a part of the
truth. He himſelf has dared to ſuppreſs the
words of my text, which immediately followed
his quotation. <q rend="inline">Before that time the various
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0162400600:70"/>
accidents of war and commerce might indeed
diffuſe an imperfect knowledge of the Goſpel
among the tribes of Caledonia, and among
the borderers of the Rhine, the Danube,
and the Euphrates;</q> and Mr. Davis has
likewiſe ſuppreſed one of the juſtificatory Notes
on this paſſage, which expreſsly points out the
time and circumſtances of the firſt Gothic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions.
Theſe exceptions, which I had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
inſerted, and Mr. Davis has cautiouſly
concealed, are ſuperfluous for the provinces of
Thrace, Maeſia, and the Leſſer Armenia, which
were contained within the precincts of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire. They allow an ample ſcope for
the more early converſion of ſome independent
diſtricts of Dacia and the Greater Armenia,
which bordered on the Danube and Euphrates;
and the entire ſenſe of this paſſage, which Mr.
Davis firſt mutilates and then attacks, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
conſiſtent with the original text of the
learned Moſheim.</p>
            <p>And yet I will fairly confeſs, that after a
nicer inquiry into the epoch of the Armenian
Church, I am not ſatisfied with the accuracy of
my own expreſſion. The aſſurance that the
firſt Chriſtian King, and the firſt Archbiſhop,
Tiridates, and St. Gregory the Illuminator,
were ſtill alive ſeveral years after the death of
Conſtantine, inclined me to believe, that the
converſion of Armenia was poſterior to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0162400600:71"/>
Revolution, which had given the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Rome to the hands of an orthodox Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.
But I had not enough conſidered the
two following circumſtances. 1. I might have
recollected the dates aſſigned by Moſes of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,
who, on this occaſion, may be regarded
as a competent witneſs. Tiridates aſcended
the throne of Armenia in the third year of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian
(Hiſt. Armeniae, l. ii. c. 79. p. 207.),
and St. Gregory, who was inveſted with the
Epiſcopal character in the ſeventeenth year of
Tiridates, governed almoſt thirty years the
Church of Armenia, and diſappeared from the
world in the forty-ſixth year of the reign of the
ſame Prince. (Hiſt. Armeniae, l. ii. c. 88.
p. 224, 225.) The conſecration of St. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory

2. The unjuſt and inglorious war which Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
undertook againſt the Armenians, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
faithful allies of the Republic, was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
derived from a motive of ſuperſtitious
zeal. The hiſtorian Euſebius (Hiſt. Eccleſ.
l. ix. c. 8. p. 448. edit. Cantab.) conſiders the
pious Armenians as a nation of Chriſtians, who
bravely defended themſelves from the hoſtile
oppreſſion of an idolatrous tyrant. Inſtead of
maintaining <q rend="inline">that the converſion of Armenia
was not attempted with any degree of ſucceſs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0162400600:72"/>
till the ſcepter was in the hands of an ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Emperor,</q> I ought to have obſerved,
that the ſeeds of the faith were deeply ſown
during the ſeaſon of the laſt and greateſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
that many Roman exiles might aſſiſt
the labours of Gregory, and that the renowned
Tiridates, the hero of the Eaſt, may diſpute
with Conſtantine the honour of being the firſt
Sovereign who embraced the Chriſtian religion.</p>
            <p>In a future edition, I ſhall rectify an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which, in ſtrictneſs, can only be applied to
the kingdoms of Iberia and Aethiopia. Had
the error been expoſed by Mr. Davis himſelf, I
ſhould not have been aſhamed to correct it;
but <hi>I am</hi> aſhamed at being reduced to contend
with an adverſary who is unable to diſcover, or
to improve his own advantages.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of proſecuting any inquiry from
whence the public might have gained inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and himſelf credit, Mr. Davis chuſes to
perplex his readers with ſome angry cavils
about the progreſs of the Goſpel in the ſecond
century. What does he mean to eſtabliſh or to
refute? Have I denied, that before the end of
that period Chriſtianity was very widely diffuſed
both in the Eaſt and in the Weſt? Has not
Juſtin Martyr affirmed, without exception or
limitation, that it was already preached to
<hi>every</hi> nation on the face of the earth? Is that
propoſition true at preſent? Could it be true in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0162400600:73"/>
the time of Juſtin? Does not Moſheim acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the exaggeration? <q rend="inline">Demus, nec enim

with becoming ſcorn and indignation, the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

            </p>
            <p>The high eſteem which Mr. Davis expreſſes
for the writings of Moſheim, would alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
how little he has read them, ſince he
muſt have been perpetually offended and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted

               <note n="9" place="bottom">Davis, p. 131.</note>. I might obſerve,
that my ſtyle, which on this occaſion was more

undeſignedly, an illiberal caſt from the rough

I may be leſs ſolicitous about my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0162400600:74"/>
and though I have repeatedly declined
the faireſt opportunities of correcting the

truth on my ſide, I am not eaſily daunted by
the names of the moſt eminent men.</p>
            <p>The aſſertion of Moſheim, which did not
ſeem to be juſtified<note n="1" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 676, Note 132.</note> by the authority of Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius,
was, that the wiſe and daughter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocletian,
Priſca and <hi>Valeria,</hi> had been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
<hi>baptized.</hi> Mr. Davis is ſure that the
words of Moſheim, <q rend="inline">Chriſtianis ſacris clam
initiata,</q> need not be confined to the rite
of baptiſm; and he is equally ſure, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Moſheim does not lead us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
even the name of Valeria. In both
theſe aſſurances he is groſsly miſtaken; but it
is the misfortune of controverſy, that an error
may be committed in three or four words,
which cannot be rectified in leſs than thirty or
forty lines.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The true and the ſole meaning of the
Chriſtian initiation, one of the familiar and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
alluſions of the Fathers of the fourth
century, is clearly explained by the exact and
laborious Bingham. <q rend="inline">The baptized were
alſo ſtyled <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, which the Latins

Hence came that form of ſpeaking ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

any doctrines or myſteries which the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens

Moſheim was capable of employing a technical
expreſſion in a looſe and equivocal ſenſe, I
ſhould indeed have violated the reſpect which
I have always entertained for his learning and
abilities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But Mr. Davis cannot diſcover in the
text of Moſheim the name of Valeria. In that
caſe Moſheim would have ſuffered another
ſlight inaccuracy to drop from his pen, as the
paſſage of Lactantius, <q rend="inline">ſacrificio pollui coë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,</q>
on which he founds his aſſertion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the names both of Priſca and Valeria.
But I am not reduced to the neceſſity of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
another in my own defence. Moſheim has
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0162400600:76"/>
properly and expreſsly declared that Valeria
imitated the pious example of her mother Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
<q rend="inline">Gener Diocletiani uxorem habebat <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi>
matris exemplum pietate erga Deum
imitantem et a cultu fictorum Numinum
alienam.</q> (Moſheim, p. 913.) Mr. Davis
has a bad habit of greedily ſnapping at the firſt
words of a reference, without giving himſelf
the trouble of going to the end of the page or
paragraph.</p>
            <p>Theſe trifling and peeviſh cavils would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
have been confounded with ſome criticiſms
of the ſame ſtamp, on which I had beſtowed a
ſlight, though ſufficient notice, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this article of Moſheim; had not my
attention been awakened by a peroration worthy
of Tertullian himſelf, if Tertullian had been
devoid of eloquence as well as of moderation—
<q rend="inline">Much leſs does the Chriſtian Moſheim give
our <hi>infidel Hiſtorian</hi> any pretext for inſerting
that <hi>illiberal malignant inſinuation,</hi> "That
Chriſtianity has, in every age, acknowledged

the remark is truly <hi>contemptible</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="bottom">Davis, p. 132.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is not my deſign to fill whole pages with

remind them how much the charms, the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the devotion of Clotilda, and of her

the converſion of France and England. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
may accept, without a bluſh, the ſervices
of the pureſt and moſt gentle portion of the

who would diſgrace Chriſtianity, if Chriſtianity

(Mem. Eccleſ. Tom. iv. p. 677. 691. Edit.

to whom I explicitly acknowledged
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0162400600:78"/>
my obligation, appeared ſynonymous to the

the paſtoral care of the Wonder-worker, and
I added the epithet of <hi>extenſive</hi>; becauſe I was
appriſed that Neo-Caeſarea was the capital of
the Polemoniac Pontus, and that the whole
kingdom of Pontus, which ſtretched above
five hundred miles along the coaſt of the Eux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
was divided between ſixteen or ſeventeen
Biſhops. (See the Georgraphia Eccleſiaſtica of
Charles de St. Paul, and Lucas Hoſtenius,
p. 249, 250, 251.) Thus far I may not be
thought to have deſerved any cenſure; but the

            <p>Let me therefore firſt obſerve, as ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of an impartial diſpoſition, that I <hi>eaſily</hi>
admitted, as the cool obſervation of the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic
Lucian, the angry and intereſted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the falſe prophet Alexander, that
Pontus was filled with Chriſtians. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
was made under the reigns of Marcus or
of Commodus, with whom the impoſtor ſo
admirably expoſed by Lucian was contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary:
and I had contented myſelf with remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the numbers of Chriſtians muſt have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0162400600:79"/>
been very unequally diſtributed in the ſeveral
parts of Pontus, ſince the dioceſe of Neo-Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea
contained, above ſixty years afterwards,
only ſeventeen Chriſtians. Such was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
flock which Gregory began to feed
about the year two hundred and forty, and the
real or fabulous converſions aſcribed by that
Wonder-working Biſhop during a reign of
thirty years, are totally foreign to the ſtate
of Chriſtianity in the preceding century.
This obvious reflection may ſerve to anſwer
the objection of Mr. Davis<note n="4" place="bottom">Davis, p. 136, 137.</note>, and of another

            </p>
            <p>I cannot help obſerving, that either Mr.
Davis's Dictionary is extremely confined, or
that in his Philoſophy all ſins are of equal
magnitude. Every error of fact or language,
every inſtance where he does not know to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the original and the reference, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
by the gentle word of miſrepreſentation.
An inaccurate appeal to the ſentiment of Pagi,
on a ſubject where I muſt have been perfectly
diſintereſted, might have been ſtyled a lapſe of
memory, inſtead of being cenſured as the effect of
vanity and ignorance. Pagi is neither a difficult
nor an uncommon writer, nor could I hope to
derive much additional fame from a <hi>pompous</hi>
quotation of his writings which I had never ſeen.</p>
            <p>The words employed by Mr. Davis, of <hi>fact,</hi>
of <hi>record,</hi> of <hi>anachroniſm,</hi> are unſkilfully cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
and ſo unhappily applied, as to betray a
very ſhameful ignorance, either of the Engliſh
language, or of the nature of this Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Queſtion. The date of Pliny's govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Bithynia is not a fact recorded by any
ancient writer, but an opinion which modern
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0162400600:81"/>
critics have variouſly formed, from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of preſumptive and collateral evidence.
Cardinal Baronius placed the conſulſhip of
Pliny one year too late; and, as he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
the old practice of th republic ſtill
ſubſiſted, he naturally ſuppoſed that Pliny
obtained his province immediately after the
expiration of his conſulſhip. He therefore
ſends him into Bithynia in the year which,
according to his erroneous computation, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incided
with the year one hundred and four,
(Baron. Annal. Eccleſ. A. D. 103. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1.
104. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1), or, according to the true chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
with the year one hundred and
two, of the Chriſtian Aera. This miſtake of
Baronius, Pagi, with the aſſiſtance of his
friend Cardinal Noris, undertakes to correct.
From an accurate parallel of the Annals of
Trajan and the Epiſtles of Pliny, he deduces
his proofs that Pliny remained at Rome ſeveral
years after his Conſulſhip: by his own inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
though ſometimes fanciful theory, of
the imperial Quinquennalia, &amp;c. Pagi at laſt
diſcovers that Pliny made his entrance into
Bithynia in the year one hundred and ten.
<q rend="inline">Plinius igitur anno Chriſti CENTESIMO DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIMO
Bithyniam intravit.</q> Pagi, tom. i.

            <p>I will be more indulgent to my adverſary
than he has been to me. I will admit, that he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0162400600:82"/>
has <hi>looked into Pagi</hi>; but I muſt add, that he
has only looked into that accurate Chronologer.
To rectify the errors, which, in the courſe of a
laborious and original work, had eſcaped the
diligence of the Cardinal, was the arduous taſk
which Pagi propoſed to execute: and for the
ſake of perſpicuity, he diſtributes his criticiſms
according to the particular dates, whether juſt
or faulty, of the Chronology of Baronius him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Under the year 102, Mr. Davis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
ſaw a long argument about Pliny and
Bithynia, and without condeſcending to read

            <p n="1">I. Mr. Davis has diſpoſed, in two columns,

paſſages from Middleton, Barbeyrac,

Inſtead of being angry with Mr. Davis for the
parallel which he has extended to ſo great a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0162400600:84"/>
length, I am under ſome obligation to his
induſtry for the copious proofs which he has
furniſhed the reader, that my repreſentation of
ſome of the moſt important facts of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

They may think that if the materials which

they may perhaps conſider me not

with a laudable degree of ſkill and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. About two hundred years ago, the Court
of Rome diſcovered that the ſyſtem which had
been erected by ignorance muſt be defended
and countenanced by the aid, or at leaſt by the
abuſe, of ſcience. The groſſer legends of the
middle ages were abandoned to contempt, but
the ſupremacy and infallibility of two hundred
Popes, the virtues of many thouſand Saints,
and the miracles which they either performed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0162400600:85"/>
or related, have been laboriouſly conſecrated
in the Eccleſiaſtical Annals of Cardinal Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.
A Theological Barometer might be
formed, of which the Cardinal and our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman
Dr. Middleton ſhould conſtitute the
oppoſite and remote extremities, as the former
ſunk to the loweſt degree of credulity, which
was compatible with learning, and the latter
roſe to the higheſt pitch of ſcepticiſm, in any
wiſe conſiſtent with Religion. The interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
gradations would be filled by a line of
eccleſiaſtical critics, whoſe rank has been fixed
by the circumſtances of their temper and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as well as by the ſpirit of the church or
ſociety to which they were attached. It would
be amuſing enough to calculate the weight of
prejudice in the air of Rome, of Oxford, of
Paris, and of Holland; and ſometimes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the irregular tendency of Papiſts towards
freedom, ſometimes to remark the unnatural
gravitation of Proteſtants towards ſlavery. But
it is uſeful to borrow the aſſiſtance of ſo many
learned and ingenious men, who have viewed
the firſt ages of the Church in every light, and
from every ſituation. If we ſkilfully combine
the paſſions and prejudices, the hoſtile motives

truth from the moſt diſingenuous controverſy.
It is the right, it is the duty of a critical hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
to collect, to weigh, to ſelect the opinions
of his predeceſſors; and the more diligence he

he may hope to add ſome improvement to the

common to all.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Beſides the ideas which may be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
by the ſtudy of the moſt learned and
ingenious of the moderns, the hiſtorian may
be indebted to them for the occaſional com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of ſome paſſages of the ancients,
which might otherwiſe have eſcaped his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or his memory. In the conſideration of
any extenſive ſubject, none will pretend to have
read all that has been written, or to recollect
all that they have read: nor is there any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
in recurring to the writers who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly
treated any queſtions, which in the
courſe of a long narrative we are called upon
to mention in a ſlight and incidental manner.
If I touch upon the obſcure and fanciful theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of the Gnoſtics, I can accept without a
bluſh the aſſiſtance of the candid Beauſobre;
and when, amidſt the fury of contending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
I trace the progreſs of eccleſiaſtical domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I am not aſhamed to confeſs myſelf the
grateful diſciple of the impartial Moſheim.

In the next Volume of my Hiſtory, the Reader
and the Critic muſt prepare themſelves to ſee
me make a ſtill more liberal uſe of the labours
of thoſe indefatigable workmen who have dug
deep into the mine of antiquity. The Fathers
of the fourth and fifth centuries are far more
voluminous than their predeceſſors; the writings
of Jerom, of Auguſtin, of Chryſoſtom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
cover the walls of our libraries. The ſmalleſt
part is of the hiſtorical kind: yet the treatiſes
which ſeem the leaſt to invite the curioſity of the
reader, frequently conceal very uſeful hints, or
very valuable facts. The polemic who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
himſelf and his antagoniſts in a cloud of
argumentation, ſometimes relates the origin
and progreſs of the hereſy which he confutes;
and the preacher who declaims againſt the
luxury, deſcribes the manners, of the age;
and ſeaſonably introduces the mention of ſome
public calamity, that he may aſcribe it to the
juſtice of offended Heaven. It would ſurely
be unreaſonable to expect that the hiſtorian
ſhould peruſe enormous volumes, with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
hope of extracting a few intereſting lines,
or that he ſhould ſacrifice whole days to the
momentary amuſement of his Reader. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
for us both, the diligence of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
critics has facilitated our inquiries: the
compilations of Tillemont might alone be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0162400600:88"/>
as an immenſe repertory of truth and
fable, of almoſt all that the Fathers have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
or invented, or believed; and if we
equally avail ourſelves of the labours of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
ſectaries, we ſhall often diſcover, that
the ſame paſſages which the prudence of one of
the diſputants would have ſuppreſſed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed,
are placed in the moſt conſpicuous
light by the active and intereſted zeal of his
adverſary. On theſe occaſions, what is the
duty of a faithful hiſtorian, who derives from
ſome modern writer the knowledge of ſome
ancient teſtimony, which he is deſirous of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
into his own narrative? It is his
duty, and it has been my invariable practice,
to conſult the original; to ſtudy with attention
the words, the deſign, the ſpirit, the context,
the ſituation of the paſſage to which I had
been referred; and before I appropriated it to
my own uſe, to juſtify my own declaration,
<q rend="inline">that I had carefully examined all the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
materials that could illuſtrate the ſubject
which I had undertaken to treat.</q> If this
important obligation has ſometimes been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly
fulfilled, I have only omitted what it
would have been impracticable for me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
The greateſt city in the world is ſtill
deſtitute of that uſeful inſtitution, a public li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary;
and the writer who has undertaken to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0162400600:89"/>
treat any large hiſtorical ſubject, is reduced to
the neceſſity of purchaſing, for his private uſe,
a numerous and valuable collection of the books
which muſt form the baſis of his work. The
diligence of his bookſellers will not always prove
ſucceſsful; and the candour of his readers will
not <hi>always</hi> expect, that, for the ſake of verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an accidental quotation of ten lines, he
ſhould load himſelf with a uſeleſs and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
ſeries of ten volumes. In a very few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
where I had not the opportunity of
conſulting the originals, I have adopted their
teſtimony on the faith of modern guides, of
whoſe fidelity I was ſatisfied; but on theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions<note n="9" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 605, N. 156; p. 606, N. 161; p. 690, N. 164; p. 699, N. 178.</note>, inſtead of decking myſelf with the
borrowed plumes of Tillemont or Lardner, I
have been moſt ſcrupulouſly exact in marking
the extent of my reading, and the ſource of
my information. This diſtinction, which a
ſenſe of truth an modeſty had engaged me to
expreſs, is ungenerouſly abuſed by Mr. Davis,
who ſeems happy to inform his Readers, that
<q rend="inline">in ONE inſtance (Chap. xvi. 164. or, in the
firſt edition, 163.) I have, by an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
overſight, unfortunately for myſelf, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to drop the modern, and that I modeſtly
diſclaim all knowledge of Athanaſius, but what
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0162400600:90"/>
I had picked up from Tillemont<note n="1" place="bottom">Davis, p. 273.</note>.</q> Without
animadverting on the decency of theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which are now grown familiar to me, I
ſhall content myſelf with obſerving, that as I
had frequently quoted Euſebius, or Cyprian,
or Tertullian, <hi>becauſe</hi> I had read them; ſo, in
this inſtance, I only made my reference to Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemont,
<hi>becauſe</hi> I had not read, and did not
poſſeſs, the works of Athanaſius. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of my undertaking has ſince directed me
to peruſe the Hiſtorical Apologies of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of Alexandria, whoſe life is a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting
part of the age in which he lived;
and if Mr. Davis ſhould have the curioſity to
look into my Second Volume, he will find that
I make a free and frequent appeal to the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Athanaſius. Whatever may be the
opinion or practice of my adverſary, this I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
to be the dealing of a fair and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The hiſtorical monuments of the three
firſt centuries of eccleſiaſtical antiquity are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
very numerous, nor very prolix. From
the end of the Act of the Apoſtles, to the time
when the firſt Apology of Juſtin Martyr was
preſented, there intervened a dark and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
period of fourſcore years; and, even if the
Epiſtles of Ignatius ſhould be approved by the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0162400600:91"/>
critic, they could not be very ſerviceable to
the hiſtorian. From the middle of the ſecond
to the beginning of the fourth century, we
gain our knowledge of the ſtate and progreſs
of Chriſtianity from the ſucceſſive Apologies
which were occaſionally compoſed by Juſtin,
Athenagoras, Tertullian, Origen, <hi>&amp;c</hi>; from
the Epiſtles of Cyprian; from a few <hi>ſincere</hi> acts
of the Martyrs; from ſome moral or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial
tracts, which indirectly explain the events
and manners of the times; from the rare and
accidental notice which profane writers have
taken of the Chriſtian ſect; from the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory
Narrative which celebrates the deaths
of the perſecutors; and from the Eccleſiaſtical
Hiſtory of Euſebius, who has preſerved ſome
valuable fragments of more early writers.
Since the revival of letters, theſe original ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
have been the common fund of critics
and hiſtorians: nor has it ever been imagined,
that the abſolute and excluſive property of a
paſſage in Euſebius or Tertullian was acquired
by the firſt who had an opportunity of quoting
it. The learned work of Moſheim, <hi>de Rebus
Chriſtianis ante Conſtantinum,</hi> was printed in the
year 1753; and if I were poſſeſſed of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and diſingenuity of Mr. Davis, I would
engage to find all the ancient teſtimonies that
he has alleged, in the writings of Dodwell or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0162400600:92"/>
Tillemont, which were publiſhed before the
end of the laſt century. But if I were animated
by any malevolent intentions againſt Dodwell
or Tillemont, I could as eaſily, and as unfairly,
fix on <hi>them</hi> the guilt of Plagiariſm, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the ſame paſſages tranſcribed or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
at full length in the Annals of Cardinal
Baronius. Let not criticiſm be any longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
by the practice of ſuch unworthy arts.
Inſtead of admitting ſuſpicions as falſe as they
are ungenerous, condour will acknowledge,
that Moſheim or Dodwell, Tillemont or Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
enjoyed the ſame right, and often were
under the ſame obligation, of quoting the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
which they had read, and which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably
requiſite to confirm the truth and
ſubſtance of their ſimilar narratives. Mr. Davis
is ſo far from allowing me the benefit of this
common indulgence, or rather of this common
right, that he ſtigmatizes with the name of
<hi>Plagiariſm</hi> a cloſe and literal agreement with
Dodwell in the account of ſome parts of the
perſecution of Diocletian, where a few chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Euſebius and Lactantius, perhaps of
Lactantius alone, are the ſole materials from
whence our knowledge could be derived, and
where, if I had not tranſcribed, I muſt have
invented. He is even bold enough (<hi>bold</hi> is not
the <hi>proper</hi> word) to conceive ſome hopes of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0162400600:93"/>
perſuading his readers, that in Hiſtorian who
has employed ſeveral years of his life, and
ſeveral hundred pages, on the Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire, had never read Oroſius,
or the Auguſtan Hiſtory; and that he was
forced to borrow, at ſecond-hand, his quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the Theodoſian Code. I cannot
profeſs myſelf very deſirous of Mr. Davis's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
but if he will take the trouble of
calling at my houſe any afternoon when I am
<hi>not</hi> at home, my ſervant ſhall ſhew him my
library, which he will find tolerably well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with the uſeful authors, ancient as well
as modern, eccleſiaſtical as well as profane,
who have <hi>directly</hi> ſupplied me with the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of my Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The peculiar reaſons, and they are not of the
moſt flattering kind, which urged me to repel
the furious and feeble attack of Mr. Davis,
have been already mentioned. But ſince I am
drawn thus reluctantly into the liſts of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,
I ſhall not retire till I have ſaluted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ſtern defiance or gentle courteſy,
the theological champions who have ſignalized
their ardour to break a lance againſt the ſhield
of a <hi>Pagan</hi> adverſary. The fifteenth and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapters have been honoured with the
notice of ſeveral writers, whoſe names and
characters ſeemed to promiſe more maturity of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0162400600:94"/>
judgment and learning than could reaſonably
be expected from the unfiniſhed ſtudies of a
Batchelor of Arts. The Reverend Mr. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe,
Dr. Watſon, the Regius Profeſſor of
Divinity in the Univerſity of Cambridge, Dr.
Chelſum of Chriſt Church, and his aſſociate
Dr. Randolph, Preſident of Chriſt Church
College, and the Lady Margaret's Profeſſor of
Divinity in the Univerſity of Oxford, have
given me a fair right, which, however, I ſhall
not abuſe, of freely declaring my opinion on
the ſubject of their reſpective criticiſms.</p>

            <p>If I am not miſtaken, Mr. Apthorpe was
the firſt who announced to the Public his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of examining the intereſting ſubject
which I had treated in the Two laſt Chapters of
my Hiſtory. The multitude of collateral and
acceſſary ideas which preſented themſelves to
the Author inſenſibly ſwelled the bulk of his
papers to the ſize of a large volume in octavo;
the publication was delayed many months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the time of the firſt advertiſement; and
when Mr. Apthorpe's Letters appeared, I
was ſurpriſed to find, that I had <hi>ſcarcely</hi> any
intereſt or concern in their contents. They are
filled with general obſervations on the Study
of Hiſtory, with a large and uſeful catalogue
of Hiſtorians, and with a variety of reflections,
moral and religious, all preparatory to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0162400600:95"/>
and formal conſideration of my Two laſt
Chapters, which Mr. Apthorpe ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
for the ſubject of a ſecond Volume. I
ſincerely reſpect the learning, the piety, and
the candour of this Gentleman, and muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it as a mark of his eſteem, that he has
thought proper to begin his approaches at ſo
great a diſtance from the fortifications which
he deſigned to attack.</p>

            <note place="margin">DR. WAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON.</note>
            <p>When Dr. Watſon gave to the Public his
Apology for Chriſtianity, in a Series of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he addreſſed them to the Author of the
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, with
a juſt confidence that he had conſidered this
important object in a manner not unworthy of
his antagoniſt or of himſelf. Dr. Watſon's
mode of thinking bears a liberal and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic
caſt; his thoughts are expreſſed with
ſpirit, and that ſpirit is always tempered by
politeneſs and moderation. Such is the man
whom I ſhould be happy to call my friend,
and whom I ſhould not bluſh to call my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt.
But the ſame motives which might
tempt me to accept, or even to ſolicit, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and amicable conference, diſſuaded me
from entering into a public controverſy with a
Writer of ſo reſpectable a character; and I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the earlieſt opportunity of expreſſing to
Dr. Watſon himſelf, how ſincerely I agreed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0162400600:96"/>
with him in thinking, <q rend="inline">That as the world is
now poſſeſſed of the opinion of us both upon
the ſubject in queſtion, it may be perhaps
as proper for us both to leave it in this
ſtate<note n="2" place="bottom">Watſon's Apology for Chriſtianity, p. 200.</note>.</q> The nature of the ingenious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor's
Apology contributed to ſtrengthen the
inſuperable reluctance to engage in hoſtile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation
which was common to us both, by
convincing me, that ſuch an altercation was
unneceſſary as well as unpleaſant. He very
juſtly and politely declares, that a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
part, near ſeventy pages, of his ſmall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
are not directed to me<note n="3" place="bottom">Id. p. 202—268.</note>, but to a ſet of
men whom he places in an odious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
light. He leaves to other hands the
defence of the leading Eccleſiaſtics, even of
the primitive church; and without being <hi>very</hi>
anxious, either to ſoften their vices and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
or to aggravate the cruelty of the
Heathen Perſecutors, he paſſes over in ſilence
the greateſt part of my Sixteenth Chapter. It
is not ſo much the purpoſe of the Apologiſt to
examine the facts which have been advanced
by the Hiſtorian, as to remove the impreſſions
which may have been formed by many of his
Readers; and the remarks of Dr. Watſon conſiſt
more properly of general argumentation than of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0162400600:97"/>
particular criticiſm. He fairly owns, that I
have expreſsly allowed the full and irreſiſtible
weight of the <hi>firſt</hi> great cauſe of the ſucceſs of
Chriſtianity<note n="4" place="bottom">Watſon's Apology for Chriſtianity, p. 5.</note>, and he is too candid to deny
that the five <hi>ſecondary</hi> cauſes, which I had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to explain, operated with <hi>ſome</hi> degree
of active energy towards the accompliſhment
of that great event. The only queſtion which
remains between us, relates to the <hi>degree</hi> of
the weight and effect of thoſe ſecondary cauſes;
and as I am perſuaded that our philoſophy is
not of the dogmatic kind, we ſhould ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that this preciſe degree cannot be
aſcertained by reaſoning, nor perhaps be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by words. In the courſe of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
ſome incidental difficulties have ariſen,
which I had ſtated with impartiality, and which
Dr. Watſon reſolves with ingenuity and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
If in ſome inſtances he ſeems to have
miſapprehended my ſentiments, I may heſitate
whether I ſhould impute the fault to my own
want of clearneſs or to his want of attention,
but I can never entertain a ſuſpicion that Dr.
Watſon would deſcend to employ the diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
arts of vulgar controverſy.</p>
            <p>There is, however, one paſſage, and one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
only, which muſt not paſs without ſome
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0162400600:98"/>
explanation; and I ſhall the more eagerly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
this occaſion to illuſtrate what I had ſaid,
as the miſconſtruction of my true meaning
ſeems to have made an involuntary, but unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable,
impreſſion on the liberal mind of Dr.
Watſon. As I endeavour <hi>not</hi> to palliate the
ſeverity, but to diſcover the motives, of the
Roman Magiſtrates. I had remarked, <q rend="inline">it
was in vain that the oppreſſed Believer
aſſerted the unalienable rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and private judgment. Though his
ſituation might excite the pity, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
could never reach the underſtanding,
either of the philoſophic or of the believing
part of the Pagan world<note n="5" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 625.</note>.</q> The humanity
of Dr. Watſon takes fire on the ſuppoſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
and he aſks me with unuſual quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<q rend="inline">How, Sir, are the arguments for liberty
of conſcience ſo exceedingly inconcluſive,
that you think them incapable of reaching
the underſtanding even of philoſophers<note n="6" place="bottom">Watſon, p. 185.</note>?</q>
He continues to obſerve, that a captious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
would embrace with avidity the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
this paſſage <hi>affords</hi> of blotting my
character with the odious ſtain of being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor;
a ſtain which no learning can wipe
out, which no genius or ability can render
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0162400600:99"/>
amiable; and though he himſelf does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
ſuch an opinion of my principles, his
ingenuity tries in vain to provide me with the
means of eſcape.</p>
            <p>I muſt lament that I have not been ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the explanation of a very ſimple notion
of the ſpirit both of philoſophy and of poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,
which I have repeatedly inculcated.
The arguments which aſſert the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
are not inconcluſive in themſelves, but
the underſtanding of the Greeks and Romans
was fortified againſt their evidence by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
prejudice. When we liſten to the voice
of Bayle, of Locke, and of genuine reaſon, in
favour of religious toleration, we ſhall eaſily
perceive that our moſt forcible appeal is made
to our mutual feelings. If the Jew was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to argue with the Inquiſitor, he would
requeſt that for a moment they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
their different ſituations, and might
ſafely aſk his Catholic Tyrant, whether the fear
of death would compel <hi>him</hi> to enter the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
gogue, to receive the mark of circumciſion,
and to partake of the paſchal lamb. As ſoon
as the caſe of perſecution was brought home to
the breaſt of the Inquiſitor, he muſt have ſound
ſome difficulty in ſuppreſſing the dictates of
natural equity, which would inſinuate to his
conſcience, that he could have no right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0162400600:100"/>
thoſe puniſhments which, under ſimilar
circumſtances, he would eſteem it as his duty
to encounter. But this argument could not
reach the underſtanding of a Polytheiſt, or of
an ancient Philoſopher. The former was ready,
whenever he was ſummoned, or indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being ſummoned, to fall proſtrate before
the altars of any Gods who were adored in any
part of the world, and to admit a vague per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
of the <hi>truth</hi> and divinity of the moſt
different modes of religion. The Philoſopher,
who conſidered them, at leaſt in their literal
ſenſe, as equally <hi>falſe</hi> and abſurd, was not
aſhamed to diſguiſe his ſentiments, and to
frame his actions according to the laws of his
country, which impoſed the ſame obligation
on the philoſophers and the people. When
Pliny declared, that whatever was the opinion
of the Chriſtians, their obſtinacy deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
the abſurd cruelty of Pliny was
excuſed in his own eye, by the conſciouſneſs
that, in the ſituation of the Chriſtians, he would
not have refuſed the religious compliance which
he exacted. I ſhall not repeat, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
worſhip was a matter, not of <hi>opinion,</hi>
but of <hi>cuſtom</hi>; that the toleration of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
was confined to nations or families who
followed the practice of their anceſtors; and
that in the firſt ages of Chriſtianity their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0162400600:101"/>
of the individuals who departed from
the eſtabliſhed religion was neither moderated
by pure reaſon, nor inflamed by excluſive zeal.
But I only deſire to appeal from the haſty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
to the more deliberate judgment of
Dr. Watſon himſelf. Should there ſtill remain
any difference of opinion between us, I ſhall be
ſatisfied, if he will conſider me as a ſincere,
though perhaps unſucceſsful, lover of truth,
and as a firm friend to civil and eccleſiaſtical
freedom.</p>

bulk; and the author, who ſeems to fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the protection of two epiſcopal banners,
has prefixed, in the front of his volume, his
name and titles, which in the former edition he
had leſs honourably ſuppreſſed. His confidence
is fortified by the alliance and communications
of a <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> Writer, Dr. Randolph, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
who, on a proper occaſion, would, no doubt,
be ready to bear as honourable teſtimony to
the merit and reputation of Dr. Chelſum. The
two friends are indeed ſo happily united by art
and nature, that if the author of the Remarks
had not pointed out the valuable communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the Margaret Profeſſor, it would
have been impoſſible to ſeparate their reſpective
property. Writers who poſſeſs any freedom of
mind, may be known from each other by the
peculiar character of their ſtyle and ſentiments;
but the champions who are inliſted in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Authority, commonly wear the uniform
of the regiment. Oppreſſed with the ſame
yoke, covered with the ſame trappings, they
heavily move along, perhaps not with an equal
pace, in the ſame beaten track of prejudice and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0162400600:103"/>
preferment. Yet I ſhould expoſe my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
were I abſolutely to confound with
Mr. Davis the two Doctors in Divinity, who
are joined in one volume. The three Critics
appear to be animated by the ſame implacable
reſentment againſt the Hiſtorian of the Roman
Empire; they are alike diſpoſed to ſupport
the ſame opinions by the ſame arts; and if in
the language of the two latter the diſregard of
politeneſs is ſomewhat leſs groſs and indecent,
the difference is not of ſuch a magnitude as to
excite in my breaſt any lively ſenſations of
gratitude. It was the misfortune of Mr. Davis
that he undertook to <hi>write</hi> before he had <hi>read.</hi>
He ſet out with the ſtock of authorities which
he found in my quotations, and boldly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to play his reputation againſt mine. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he may now repent of a loſs which is not
eaſily recovered; but if I had not ſurmounted
my almoſt inſuperable reluctance to a public
diſpute, many a reader might ſtill be dazzled
by the vehemence of his aſſertions, and might
ſtill believe that Mr. Davis had detected ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
wilful and important miſrepreſentations
in my Two laſt Chapters. But the confederate
Doctors appear to be ſcholars of a higher form
and longer experience; they enjoy a certain
rank in their academical world; and as their
zeal is enlightened by ſome rays of knowledge,
ſo their deſire to ruin the credit of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0162400600:104"/>
is occaſionally checked by the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of injuring their own. Theſe reſtraints,
to which Mr. Davis was a ſtranger, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
them to a very narrow and humble path
of hiſtorical criticiſm; and if I were to correct,
according to their wiſhes, all the particular
facts againſt which they have advanced any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
theſe corrections, admitted in their
fulleſt extent, would hardly furniſh materials
for a decent liſt of <hi>errata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>dogmatical</hi> part of their work, which in
every ſenſe of the word deſerves that appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is ill adapted to engage my attention.
I had declined the conſideration of theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
arguments, when they were managed by a
candid and liberal adverſary; and it would be
inconſiſtent enough, if I ſhould have refuſed to
draw my ſword in honourable combat againſt
the keen and well-tempered weapon of Dr.
Watſon, for the ſole purpoſe of encountering
the ruſtic cudgel of two ſtaunch and ſturdy Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemics.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enter any farther into the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and conduct of Cyprian, as I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that if the opinion of Le Clerc, Moſheim,

his ally, the difference muſt ſubſiſt, till we

and Eccleſiaſtical power<note n="7" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 558, 559. Chelſum, p. 132—139.</note>. If Dr. Randolph

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0162400600:106"/>
of Joſephus, I may deem myſelf ſecure behind
the ſhield of learned and pious critics (See in
particular Le Clerc, in his Ars Critica, part
iii. ſect. i. c. 15. and Lardner's Teſtimonies,
Vol. i. p. 150, &amp;c.), who have condemned
this paſſage: and I think it very natural that
Dr. Chelſum ſhould embrace the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which is not deſtitute of able advocates.
The paſſages of Irenaeus and Theophilus were
thoroughly ſifted in the controverſy about the
duration of Miracles; and as the Works of Dr.
Middleton may be found in every library, ſo
it is not impoſſible that a diligent ſearch may
ſtill diſcover ſome remains of the writings of
his adverſaries. In mentioning the confeſſion
of the Syrians of Paleſtine, that they had received
from Egypt the rite of circumciſion, I had ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
alleged the teſtimony of Herodotus, without
expreſsly adopting the ſentiment of Marſham.
But I had always imagined, that in theſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and indifferent queſtions, which have been ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
argued before the tribunal of the Public,
every ſcholar was at liberty to chuſe his ſide,
without aſſigning his reaſons; nor can I yet
perſuade myſelf, that either Dr. Chelſum, or
myſelf, are likely to enforce, by any new argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the opinions which we have reſpectively
followed. The only novelty for which I can
perceive myſelf indebted to Dr. Chelſum, is
the very extraordinary Scepticiſm which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates
concerning the time of Herodotus,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0162400600:107"/>
who, according to the chronology of ſome, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
during the time of the Jewiſh captivity<note n="3" place="bottom">Chelſum, p. 15.</note>.
Can it be neceſſary to inform a Divine, that
the captivity which laſted ſeventy years, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the prophecy of Jeremiah, was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in the year 536 before Chriſt, by the
edict which Cyrus publiſhed in the firſt year of
his reign (Jeremiah, xxv. 11, 12. xxix. 10.
Ezra, i. 1. &amp;c. Uſher and Prideaux, under the
years 606 and 536.)? Can it be neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
a man of letters, that Herodotus was
fifty-three years old at the commencement of
the Peloponneſian war (Aulus Gellius, Noct.
Attic. xv. 23. from the Commentaries of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phila),
and conſequently that he was born in
the year before Chriſt 484, fifty-two years
after the end of the Jewiſh captivity? As this
well atteſted fact is not expoſed to the ſlighteſt
doubt or difficulty, I am ſomewhat curious to
learn the names of thoſe unknown authors,
whoſe chronology Dr. Chelſum has allowed as
the ſpecious foundation of a probable hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.
The Author of the Remarks, does not
ſeem indeed to have cultivated, with much care
or ſucceſs, the province of literary hiſtory; as
a very moderate acquaintance with that uſeful
branch of knowledge would have ſaved him
from a poſitive miſtake, much leſs excuſable
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0162400600:108"/>
than the doubt which he entertains about the
time of Herodotus. He ſtyles Suidas <q rend="inline">a
<hi>Heathen</hi> writer, who lived about the end of
the <hi>tenth</hi> century<note n="4" place="bottom">Chelſum. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>.</q> I admit the period
which he aſſigns to Suidas; and which is well
aſcertained by Dr. Bentley (See his Reply to
Boyle, p. 22, 23.) We are led to fix this
epoch by the chronology which this <hi>Heathen</hi>
writer has deduced from Adam, to the death of
the emperor John Zimiſces, A. D. 975: and a
crowd of paſſages might be produced, as the
unaſwerable evidence of his Chriſtianity. But
the moſt unanſwerable of all is the very date,
which is not diſputed between us. The philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
who flouriſhed under Juſtinian (See
Agathias, l. ii. p. 65, 66.), appear to have
been the laſt of the Heathen writers: and the
ancient religion of the Greeks was annihilated
almoſt four hundred years before the birth of
Suidas.</p>
            <p>After this animadverſion, which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
either to inſult the failings of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
or to provide a convenient excuſe for
my own errors, I ſhall proceed to ſelect <hi>two</hi>
important parts of Dr. Chelſum's Remarks,
from which the candid reader may form ſome
opinion of the whole. They relate to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
ſervice of the firſt Chriſtians, and to the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0162400600:109"/>
hiſtorical character of Euſebius; and I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
them with the leſs reluctance, as it may
not be impoſſible to pick up ſomething curious
and uſeful even in the barren waſte of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy.</p>

               <p>In repreſenting the errors of the primitive
Chriſtians, which flowed from an exceſs of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
I had obſerved, <hi>that</hi> they expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the reproaches of the Pagans, by their
obſtinate refuſal to take an active part in the

and <hi>that</hi> the Apologiſts, to whom the

               <p>On this occaſion Dr. Chelſum is extremely

ſtory of Marcellus, not from Ruinart, but
from Voltaire. My learned Adverſary thinks
it highly improbable that Origen ſhould dare to
<hi>mutilate</hi> the objections of Celſus, <q rend="inline">whoſe work
was, in all probability, extant at the time he
made this reply. In ſuch caſe, had he even
been inclined to treat his adverſary unfairly,
he muſt yet ſurely have been with-held from
the attempt, through the fear of detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="7" place="bottom">Chelſum, p. 118, 119.</note>.</q>
The experience both of ancient
and modern controverſy, has indeed convinced
me that this reaſoning, juſt and natural as it
may ſeem, is totally inconcluſive, and that the
generality of diſputants, eſpecially in religious
conteſts, are of a much more daring and intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
ſpirit. For the truth of this remark, I ſhall
content myſelf with producing a recent and very
ſingular example, in which Dr. Chelſum him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is perſonally intereſted. He charges<note n="8" place="bottom">Id. p. 188.</note> me
with paſſing over in <q rend="inline">ſilence the important
and unſuſpected teſtimony of a Heathen hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian
(Dion Caſſius) to the perſecution of
Domitian; and he affirms, that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
that teſtimony ſo far only as it relates
to Clemens and Domitilla; yet in the very
ſame paſſage, follows immediately, that on
a like accuſation MANY OTHERS were alſo
condemned. Some of them were put to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0162400600:115"/>
death, others ſuffered the confiſcation of
their goods<note n="9" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 645.</note>.</q> Although I ſhould not be
aſhamed to undertake the apology of Nero or
Domitian, if I thought them innocent of any
particular crime with which zeal or malice had
unjuſtly branded their memory; yet I ſhould
indeed bluſh, if, in favour of tyranny, or even
in favour of virtue, I had ſuppreſſed the truth
and evidence of hiſtorical facts. But the
Reader will feel ſome ſurprize, when he has
convinced himſelf that, in the three editions of
my Firſt Volume, after relating the death of
Clemens, and the exile of Domitilla, I continue
to allege the ENTIRE TESTIMONY of Dion, in
the following words: <q rend="inline">and ſentences either
of death, or of confiſcation, were pronounced
againſt a GREAT NUMBER OF PERSONS who
were involved in the SAME accuſation. The
guilt imputed to their charge, was that of
Atheiſm and Jewiſh manners; a ſingular
aſſociation of ideas which cannot with any
propriety be applied except to the Chriſtians,
as they were obſcurely and imperfectly
viewed by the magiſtrates and writers of
that period.</q> Dr. Chelſum has not been
deterred, by the fear of detection, from this
ſcandalous mutilation of the popular work of a
living adverſary. But Celſus had been dead
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0162400600:116"/>
above fifty years before Origen publiſhed his
Apology; and the copies of an ancient work,
inſtead of being inſtantaneouſly multiplied by
the operation of the preſs, were ſeparately and
ſlowly tranſcribed by the labour of the hand.</p>
               <p>If any modern Divine ſhould ſtill maintain
that the fidelity of Origen was ſecured by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
more honourable than the fear of detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he may learn from Jerom the difference
of the <hi>gymnaſtic</hi> and <hi>dogmatic</hi> ſtyles. Truth is
the object of the one, Victory of the other;
and the ſame arts which would diſgrace the
ſincerity of the teacher, ſerve only to diſplay
the ſkill of the diſputant. After juſtifying his
own practice by that of the orators and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
Jerom defends himſelf by the more
reſpectable authority of Chriſtian Apologiſts.

               <p>Yet Dr. Chelſum may ſtill aſk, and he has
a right to aſk, why in this particular inſtance I
ſuſpect the pious Origen of mutilating the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of his adverſary. From a very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and, in my opinion, a very deciſive cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.
Celſus was a Greek philoſopher,
the friend of Lucian; and I thought that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he might ſupport error by ſophiſtry, he
would not write nonſenſe in his own language.
I renounce my ſuſpicion, if the moſt attentive
reader is able to underſtand the deſign and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of a paſſage which is given as a formal
quotation from Celſus, and which begins with
the following words: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
&amp;c. (Origen contr. Celſum, l. viii.
p. 425. edit. Spencer, Cantab. 1677.) I have
carefully inſpected the original, I have availed
myſelf of the learning of Spencer, and even
Bouhereau (for I ſhall always diſclaim the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and affected pedantry of uſing without
ſcruple a Latin verſion, but of deſpiſing the
aid of a French tranſlation), and the ill ſucceſs
of my efforts has countenanced the ſuſpicion to
which I ſtill adhere, with a juſt mixture of
doubt and heſitation. Origen very boldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0162400600:118"/>
that any of the Chriſtians have affirmed
what is imputed to them by Celſus, in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
quotation; and it may eaſily be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited,
that none had maintained what none
can comprehend. Dr. Chelſum has produced
the words of Origen; but on this occaſion
there is a ſtrange ambiguity in the language of
the modern Divine<note n="1" place="bottom">Chelſum, p. 118.</note>, as if he wiſhed to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
what he dared not affirm; and every reader
muſt conclude, from his ſtate of the queſtion,
that Origen expreſsly denied the truth of the
<hi>accuſation</hi> of Celſus, who had <hi>accuſed</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
of declining to aſſiſt their fellow-ſubjects
in the military defence of the empire, aſſailed
on every ſide by the arms of the Barbarians.</p>
               <p>Will Dr. Chelſum juſtify to the world, can
he juſtify to his own feelings, the abuſe which
he has made even of the privileges of the Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtic
ſtyle? Careleſs and haſty indeed muſt
have been his peruſal of Origen, if he did not
perceive that the ancient Apologiſt, who makes
a ſtand on ſome incidental queſtion, admits
the accuſation of his adverſary, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<hi>refuſed</hi> to bear arms even at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of their Sovereign. "<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>" (Origen, l. viii. p. 427.)
He endeavours to palliate this undutiful refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
by repreſenting that the Chriſtians had
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0162400600:119"/>
their peculiar camps, in which they inceſſantly
combated for the ſafety of the emperor and
the empire by lifting up their right hands—in
prayer. The Apologiſt ſeems to hope that his
country will be ſatisfied with this ſpiritual aid,
and dexterouſly confounding the colleges of
Roman prieſts with the multitudes which ſwelled
the Catholic Church, he claims for his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
in all the provinces, the exemption
from military ſervice, which was enjoyed by
the ſacerdotal order. But as this excuſe might
not readily be allowed, Origen looks forwards
with a lively faith to that auſpicious Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which Celſus had rejected as impoſſible,
when all the nations of the habitable earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
their paſſions and their arms, ſhould
embrace the pure doctrines of the Goſpel, and
lead a life of peace and innocence under the
immediate protection of Heaven. The faith
of Origen ſeems to be principally founded on
the predictions of the Prophet Zephaniah (See
iii. 9, 10.); and he prudently obſerves, that
the Prophets often ſpeak ſecret things (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

by thoſe who can underſtand them; and
that if this ſtupendous change cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
while we retain our bodies, it may be
accompliſhed as ſoon as we ſhall be releaſed
from them. Such is the reaſoning of Origen:
though I have not followed the order, I have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0162400600:120"/>
faithfully preſerved the ſubſtance of it; which
fully juſtifies the truth and propriety of my
obſervations.</p>
               <p>The execution of Marcellus, the Centurion,
is naturally connected with the Apology of
Origen, as the former declared by his actions,
what the latter had affirmed in his writings,
that the conſcience of a devout Chriſtian would
not allow him to bear arms, even at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his Sovereign. I had repreſented this
religious ſcruple as <hi>one</hi> of the motives which
provoked Marcellus, on the day of a public
feſtival, to throw away the enſigns of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and I preſumed to obſerve, that ſuch
an act of deſertion would have been puniſhed
in any government according to martial or
even civil law. Dr. Chelſum<note n="2" place="bottom">Chelſum, p. 114—117.</note> very <hi>bluntly</hi>
accuſes me of miſrepreſenting the ſtory, and of
ſuppreſſing thoſe circumſtances which would
have defended the Centurion from the unjuſt
imputation thrown by me upon his conduct.
The diſpute between the Advocate for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus
and myſelf, lies in a very narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs;
as the whole evidence is comprized in a
ſhort, ſimple, and, I believe, authentic nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In another place I obſerved, and even
preſſed the obſervation, <q rend="inline">that the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Deities and rites of Polytheiſm were
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0162400600:121"/>
cloſely interwoven with every circumſtance
of buſineſs or pleaſure, of public or of private
life;</q> and I had particularly ſpecified how
much the Roman diſcipline was connected with
the national ſuperſtition. A ſolemn oath of
fidelity was repeated every year in the name of
the Gods and of the genius of the Emperor,
public and daily ſacrifices were performed at the
head of the camp, the legionary was continually
tempted, or rather compelled to join in the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
worſhip of his fellow-ſoldiers, and had
not any ſcruples been entertained of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of war, it is not eaſy to underſtand how
any ſerious Chriſtian could inliſt under a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
which has been juſtly termed the <hi>rival of
the Croſs.</hi> "Vexilla aemula Chriſti." (Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian
de Corona Militis, c. xi.) With regard
to the ſoldiers, who before their converſion
were already engaged in the military life, fear,
habit, ignorance, neceſſity might bend them to
ſome acts of occaſional conformity; and as
long as they abſtained from abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional
idolatry, their behaviour was excuſed
by the indulgent, and cenſured by the more
rigid caſuiſts. (See the whole Treatiſe <hi>De Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronâ
Militis.</hi>) We are ignorant of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and character of the Centurion Marcellus,
how long he had conciliated the profeſſion of
arms and of the Goſpel, whether he was only a
Catechumen, or whether he was initiated by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0162400600:122"/>
the Sacrament of Baptiſm. We are likewiſe at
a loſs to aſcertain the particular act of idolatry
which ſo ſuddenly and ſo forcibly provoked his
pious indignation. As he declared his faith in
the midſt of a public entertainment given on
the birth-day of Galerius, he muſt have been
ſtartled by ſome of the ſacred and convivial
rites (Convivia iſta profana reputans) of
prayers, or vows, or libations, or, perhaps, by
the offenſive circumſtance of eating the meats
which had been offered to the idols. But the
ſcruples of Marcellus were not confined to
theſe accidental impurities; they evidently
reached the eſſential duties of his profeſſion;
and when before the tribunal of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
he avowed his faith at the hazard of
his life, the Centurion declared, as his cool
and determined perſuaſion, that it does not
become a Chriſtian man, who is the ſoldier of
the Lord Chriſt, to bear arms for any object
of earthly concern. <q rend="inline">Non enim decebat
Chriſtianum hominem moleſtiis ſecularibus
militare, qui Chriſto Domino militat.</q> A
formal declaration, which clearly diſengages
from each other the different queſtions of war
and idolatry. With regard to both theſe
queſtions, as they were underſtood by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Chriſtians, I wiſh to refer the Reader
to the ſentiments and authorities of Mr. Moyle,
a bold and ingenious critic, who read the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0162400600:123"/>
as their judge, and not as their ſlave,
and who has refuted, with the moſt patient
candour, all that learned prejudice could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
in favour of the ſilly ſtory of the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
legion. (See Moyle's Works, Vol. ii.
p. 84—88. 111—116. 163—212. 298—302.
327—341.) And here let me add, that the
paſſage of Origen, who in the name of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
diſclaims the duty of military ſervice, is
underſtood by Mr. Moyle in its true and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
ſignification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I know not where Dr. Chelſum has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
the principles of logic or morality which
teach him to approve the conduct of Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
who threw down his rod, his belt, and
his arms, at the head of the legion, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly
renounced the military ſervice, <hi>at the very
time</hi> when he found himſelf obliged to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
Yet ſurely this is a very falſe notion
of the condition and duties of a Roman Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion.
Marcellus was bound, by a ſolemn
oath, to ſerve with fidelity till he ſhould be
regularly diſcharged; and according to the
ſentiments which Dr. Chelſum aſcribes to him,
he was not releaſed from this oath by any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
opinion of the unlawfulneſs of war. I
would propoſe it as a caſe of conſcience to any
philoſopher, or even to any caſuiſt in Europe,
Whether a particular order, which cannot
be reconciled with virtue or piety, diſſolves the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0162400600:124"/>
ties of a general and lawful obligation? And
whether, if they had been conſulted by the
Chriſtian Centurion, they would not have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
him to increaſe his diligence in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his military functions, to refuſe to yield to
any act of idolatry, and patiently to expect the
conſequences of ſuch a refuſal? But inſtead of
obeying the mild and moderate dictates of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
inſtead of diſtinguiſhing between the
duties of the ſoldier and of the Chriſtian, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,
with imprudent zeal, ruſhed forwards
to ſeize the crown of martyrdom. He might
have privately confeſſed himſelf guilty to the
tribune or praefect under whom he ſerved: he
choſe on the day of a public feſtival to diſturb
the order of the camp. He inſulted without
neceſſity the religion of his Sovereign and of
his country, by the epithets of contempt which
he beſtowed on the Roman Gods. <q rend="inline">Deos
veſtros ligneos et lapideos, adorare contemno,
quae ſunt idola ſurda et muta.</q> Nay more:
at the head of the legion, and in the face of
the ſtandards, the Centurion Marcellus openly
renounced his allegiance to the Emperors. <q rend="inline">Exhoc
militare IMPERATORIBUS VESTRIS de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſto;</q>
From this moment I no longer ſerve
YOUR EMPERORS, are the important words of
Marcellus, which his advocate has not thought
proper to tranſlate. I again make my appeal
to any lawyer, to any military man, Whether,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0162400600:125"/>
under ſuch circumſtances, the pronoun <hi>your</hi>
has not a ſeditious and even treaſonable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?
And whether the officer who ſhould
make this declaration, and at the ſame time
throw away his ſword at the head of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
would not be condemned for mutiny
and deſertion by any court-martial in Europe?
I am the rather diſpoſed to judge favourably of
the conduct of the Roman government, as I
cannot diſcover any deſire to take advantage
of the indiſcretion of Marcellus. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the Legion ſeemed to lament that
it was not in his power to diſſemble this raſh
action. After a delay of more than three
months, the Centurion was examined before
the Vice-praefect, his ſuperior Judge, who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him the faireſt opportunities of explaining
or qualifying his ſeditious expreſſions, and at
laſt condemned him to loſe his head; not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
becauſe he was a Chriſtian, but becauſe he
had violated his military oath, thrown away
his belt, and publicly blaſphemed the Gods
and the Emperors. Perhaps the impartial
reader will confirm the ſentence of the Vice-Praefect
Agricolanus, <q rend="inline">Ita ſe habent facta
Marcelli, ut haec <hi>diſciplinâ</hi> debeant vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the plaineſt evidence, Dr.
Chelſum will not believe that either Origen in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0162400600:126"/>
Theory, or Marcellus in Practice, could ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
object to the uſe of arms; <q rend="inline">becauſe it is
well known, that far from declining the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of war altogether, whole legions of
Chriſtians ſerved in the Imperial armies<note n="8" place="bottom">Chelſum, p. 113.</note>.</q>
I have not yet diſcovered, in the Author or
Authors of the Remarks, many traces of a
clear and enlightened underſtanding, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſuppoſe them ſo deſtitute of every reaſoning
principle, as to imagine that they here allude
to the conduct of the Chriſtians who embraced
the profeſſion of arms after their religion had
obtained a public eſtabliſhment. Whole legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Chriſtians ſerved under the banners of
Conſtantine and Juſtinian, as whole regiments
of Chriſtians are now inliſted in the ſervice of
France or England. The repreſentation which
I had given, was confined to the principles and
practice of the Church of which Origen and
Marcellus were members, before the ſenſe of
public and private intereſt had reduced the
lofty ſtandard of Evangelical perfection to the
ordinary level of human nature. In thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times, where are the Chriſtian legions
that ſerved in the Imperial armies? Our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Pompeys may ſtamp with their foot,
but no armed men will ariſe out of the earth,
except the ghoſts of the Thundering and the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0162400600:127"/>
Thebaean legions, the former renowned for a
Miracle, and the latter for a Martyrdom.
Either the two Proteſtant Doctors muſt acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce
under ſome imputations which are better
underſtood than expreſſed, or they muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare,
in the full light and freedom of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
century, to undertake the defence of
two obſolete legends, the leaſt abſurd of which
ſtaggered the well-diſciplined credulity of a
Franciſcan Friar. (See Pagi Critic. ad Annal.
Baronii, A. D. 174. tom. i. p. 168.) Very
different was the ſpirit and taſte of the learned
and ingenuous Dr. Jortin, who after treating
the ſilly ſtory of the Thundering Legion with
the contempt it deſerved, continues in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words: <q rend="inline">Moyle wiſhes no greater

               <p>A grave and pathetic complaint is introduced
by Dr. Chelſum, into his preface<note n="9" place="bottom">P. ii, iii.</note>, that Mr.
Gibbon, who has often referred to the Fathers
of the Church, ſeems to have entertained a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
diſtruſt of thoſe reſpectable witneſſes.
The Critic is ſcandalized at the epithets of
ſcanty and <hi>ſuſpicious,</hi> which are applied to the
materials of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory; and if he
cannot impeach the truth of the former, he
cenſures in the moſt angry terms the injuſtice
of the latter. He aſſumes, with peculiar
zeal, the defence of Euſebius, the venerable
parent of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, and labours to
reſcue his character from the <hi>groſs miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
on which Mr. Gibbon has openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted<note n="1" place="bottom">Chelſum and Randolph, p. 220—238.</note>. He obſerves, as if he ſagaciouſly
foreſaw the objection, <q rend="inline">That it will not be
ſufficient here to alledge a few inſtances of
apparent credulity in ſome of the Fathers,
in order to fix a general charge of <hi>ſuſpicion</hi>
on all.</q> But it <hi>may</hi> be ſufficient to allege
a clear and fundamental principle of hiſtorical
as well as legal Criticiſm, that whenever we
are deſtitute of the means of comparing the
teſtimonies of the oppoſite parties, the evidence
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0162400600:129"/>
of <hi>any</hi> witneſs, however illuſtrious by his rank
and titles, is juſtly to be <hi>ſuſpected</hi> in his own
cauſe. It is unfortunate enough, that I ſhould
be engaged with adverſaries, whom their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
of ſtudy and converſation appear to have
left in total ignorance of the principles which
univerſally regulate the opinions and practice
of mankind.</p>
               <p>As the ancient world was not diſtracted by
the fierce conflicts of hoſtile ſects, the free and
eloquent writers of Greece and Rome had
few opportunities of indulging their paſſions,
or of exerciſing their impartiality in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of religious events. Since the origin of
Theological Factions, ſome Hiſtorians, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus
Marcellinus, Fra-Paolo, Thuanus,
Hume, and perhaps a few others, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the ſingular praiſe of holding the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
with a ſteady and equal hand. Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
and unconnected, they contemplated
with the ſame indifference, the opinions and
intereſts of the contending parties; or, if they
were ſeriouſly attached to a particular ſyſtem,
they were armed with a firm and moderate
temper, which enabled them to ſuppreſs their
affections, and to ſacrifice their reſentments.
In this ſmall, but <hi>venerable</hi> Synod of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Euſebius cannot claim a ſeat. I had
acknowledged, and I ſtill think, that his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0162400600:130"/>
was leſs tinctured with credulity than
that of moſt of his contemporaries; but as his
enemies muſt admit that he was ſincere and
earneſt in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ſo the
warmeſt of his admirers, or at leaſt of his
readers, muſt diſcern, and will probably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud,
the religious zeal which diſgraces or
adorns every page of his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.
This laborious and uſeful work was publiſhed
at a time, between the defeat of Licinius and
the Council of Nice, when the reſentment of
the Chriſtians was ſtill warm, and when the
Pagans were aſtoniſhed and diſmayed by the
recent victory and converſion of the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.
The materials, I ſhall dare to repeat
the invidious epithets of ſcanty and ſuſpicious,
were extracted from the accounts which the
Chriſtians themſelves had given of their <hi>own</hi>
ſufferings, and of the cruelty of their enemies.
The Pagans had ſo long and ſo contemptuouſly
neglected the riſing greatneſs of the Church,
that the Biſhop of Caeſarea had little either to
hope or to fear from the writers of the oppoſite
party; almoſt all of that <hi>little</hi> which did exiſt,
has been accidentally loſt, or purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
and the candid enquirer may vainly
wiſh to compare with the Hiſtory of Euſebius,
ſome Heathen narrative of the perſecutions of
Decius and Diocletian. Under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
it is the duty of an impartial judge to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0162400600:131"/>
be counſel for the priſoner, who is incapabale of
making any defence for himſelf; and it is the
firſt office of a counſel to examine with diſtruſt
and <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> the intereſted evidence of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer.
Reaſon juſtifies the ſuſpicion, and it is
confirmed by the conſtant experience of modern
Hiſtory, in almoſt every inſtance where we
have an opportunity of comparing the mutual
complaints and apologies of the religious fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who have diſturbed each other's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in this world, for the ſake of ſecuring it
in the next.</p>
               <p>As we are deprived of the means of contraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the adverſe relations of the Chriſtians and
Pagans; it is the more incumbent on us to
improve the opportunities of trying the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of Euſebius, by the original, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
occaſional teſtimonies of the more ancient
writers of his own party. Dr. Chelſum<note n="2" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 653. Chelſum, p. 204—207.</note> has
obſerved, that the celebrated paſſage of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,
which has ſo much thinned the ranks of
the army of Martyrs, muſt be confined to the
perſecutions that had already happened. I
cannot diſpute this ſagacious remark, but I
ſhall venture to add, that this paſſage more
immediately relates to the religious tempeſts
which had been excited in the time and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Origen; and ſtill more particularly to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0162400600:132"/>
the city of Alexandria, and to the perſecution
of Severus, in which young Origen ſucceſsfully
exhorted his father, to ſacrifice his life and
fortune for the cauſe of Chriſt. From ſuch
unqueſtionable evidence, I am authoriſed to
conclude, that the number of holy victims who
ſealed their faith with their blood was not, on
this occaſion, very conſiderable: but I cannot
reconcile this fair concluſion with the poſitive
declaration of Euſebius, (l. vi. c. 2. p. 258)
that at Alexandria, in the perſecution of Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
an innumerable, at leaſt an indefinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

the Crown of Martyrdom. The advocates for

againſt the credibility of the Eccleſiaſtical

paſſages of the Biſhop of Caeſarea. He

that we ſhould hear Euſebius, before we utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the importance of the diſcovery. But was
it poſſible? Could it be my deſign to quote the
words of Euſebius, when I reduced into one
ſentence the ſpirit and ſubſtance of two diffuſe
and diſtinct paſſages? If I have given the
true ſenſe and meaning of the Eccleſiaſtical
Hiſtorian, I have diſcharged the duties of a
fair Interpreter; nor ſhall I refuſe to reſt the
proof of my fidelity on the tranſlation of thoſe
two paſſages of Euſebius, which Dr. Chelſum
produces in his favour<note n="5" place="bottom">P. 228. 231.</note>. <q rend="inline">But it is not our
part to deſcribe the ſad calamities which at

on which account we have determined
to relate nothing more concerning them than
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0162400600:139"/>
may ſerve to juſtify the Divine Judgment.
We therefore have not been induced to
make mention either of thoſe who were
tempted in the perſecution, or of thoſe who
made utter ſhipwreck of their ſalvation, and
who were ſunk of their own accord in the
depths of the ſtorm; but ſhall only add
thoſe things to our General Hiſtory, which
may in the firſt place be profitable to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and afterwards to poſterity.</q> In the
other paſſage, Euſebius, after mentioning the
diſſentions of the Confeſſors among themſelves,
again declares that it is his intention to paſs
over all theſe things. <q rend="inline">Whatſoever things,

the Apoſtle, who was recommending the
practice of virtue) whatſoever things are

               <p n="2">2. I had contented myſelf with obſerving,
that Euſebius had violated one of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
laws of hiſtory, <hi>Ne quid veri dicere non
audeat</hi>; nor could I imagine, if the <hi>fact</hi> was
allowed, that any queſtion could poſſibly ariſe
upon the matter of <hi>right.</hi> I was indeed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken;
and I now begin to underſtand why I
have given ſo little ſatisfaction to Dr. Chelſum,
and to other critics of the ſame complexion, as
our ideas of the duties and the privileges of an
hiſtorian appear to be ſo widely different. It
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0162400600:141"/>
is alleged, that <q rend="inline">every writer has a right to
chuſe his ſubject, for the particular benefit
of his reader; that he has explained his own
plan conſiſtently; that he conſiders himſelf,
according to it, not as a complete hiſtorian
of the times, but rather as a <hi>didactic</hi> writer,
whoſe main object is to make his work like
the Scriptures themſelves, PROFITABLE FOR
DOCTRINE; that as he treats only of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Church, the plan is at leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable,
perhaps peculiarly proper; and that
he has conformed himſelf to the principal
duty of an hiſtorian, while, according to his
immediate deſign, he has not particularly
related any of the tranſactions which could
tend to the diſgrace of religion<note n="6" place="bottom">Chelſum, p. 229, 230, 231.</note>.</q> The
hiſtorian muſt indeed be generous, who will
conceal, by his own diſgrace, that of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or of his religion. Whatever ſubject he
has choſen, whatever perſons he introduces, he
owes to himſelf, to the preſent age, and to
poſterity, a juſt and perfect delineation of all
that may be praiſed, of all that may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
and of all that muſt be cenſured. If he
fails in the diſcharge of his important office, he
partially violates the ſacred obligations of truth,
and diſappoints his readers of the inſtruction
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0162400600:142"/>
which they might have derived from a fair
parallel of the vices and virtues of the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
characters. Herodotus might range
without controul in the ſpacious walks of the
Greek and Barbaric domain, and Thucydides
might confine his ſteps to the narrow path of
the Peloponneſian war; but thoſe hiſtorians
would never have deſerved the eſteem of poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
if they had deſignedly ſuppreſſed or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiently
mentioned thoſe facts which could tend
to the diſgrace of Greece or of Athens. Theſe
unalterable dictates of conſcience and reaſon
have been <hi>ſeldom</hi> queſtioned, though they have
been ſeldom obſerved; and we muſt ſincerely
join in the honeſt complaint of Melchior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
<q rend="inline">that the lives of the philoſophers have
been compoſed by Laertius, and thoſe of
the Caeſars by Suetonius, with a much
ſtricter and more ſevere regard for hiſtoric
truth, than can be found in the lives of
ſaints and martyrs, as they are deſcribed by
Catholic writers.</q> (See Loci Communes,
l. xi. p. 650, apud Clericum, Epiſtol. Critic. v.
p. 136.) And yet the partial repreſentation of
truth is of far more pernicious conſequence in
eccleſiaſtical than in civil hiſtory. If Laertius
had concealed the defects of Plato, or if Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius
had diſguiſed the vices of Auguſtus, we
ſhould have been deprived of the knowledge
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0162400600:143"/>
of ſome curious, and perhaps inſtructive facts,
and our idea of thoſe celebrated men might
have been more favourable than they deſerved;
but I cannot diſcover any practical inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
which could have been the reſult of
our ignorance. But if Euſebius had fairly and
circumſtantially related the ſcandalous diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Confeſſors; if he had ſhewn that
their virtues were tinctured with pride and
obſtinacy, and that their lively faith was not
exempt from ſome mixture of enthuſiaſm; he
would have armed his readers againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
veneration for thoſe holy men, which
imperceptibly degenerated into religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
The ſucceſs of theſe <hi>didactic</hi> hiſtories,
by concealing or palliating every circumſtance
of human infirmity, was one of the moſt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
means of conſecrating the memory, the
bones, and the writings of the ſaints of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
party; and a great part of the errors
and corruptions of the Church of Rome may
fairly be aſcribed to this criminal diſſimulation
of the eccleſiaſtical hiſtorians. As a Proteſtant
Divine, Dr. Chelſum muſt abhor theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but as a Chriſtian, he ſhould be careful
leſt his apology for the prudent choice of Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
ſhould ſix an indirect cenſure on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved
ſincerity of the four Evangeliſts. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of confining their narrative to thoſe things
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0162400600:144"/>
which are virtuous and of good report, inſtead of
following the plan which is here recommended
as <hi>peculiarly proper</hi> for the affairs of the Church,
the inſpired writers have thought it their duty
to relate the moſt minute circumſtances of the
fall of St. Peter, without conſidering whether
the behaviour of an Apoſtle, who thrice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
his Divine Maſter, might redound to the
honour or to the diſgrace of Chriſtianity. If
Dr. Chelſum ſhould be frightened by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
conſequence, if he ſhould be deſirous
of ſaving his faith from <hi>utter ſhipwreck,</hi> by
throwing over-board the uſeleſs lumber of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
and reflection, I am not enough his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to impede the ſucceſs of his honeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
               <p>The didactic method of writing hiſtory is ſtill
more profitably exerciſed by Euſebius in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
work, which he has intitled, The Life of
Conſtantine, his gracious patron and benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Prieſts and poets have enjoyed in every
age a privilege of flattery; but if the actions
of Conſtantine are compared with the perfect
idea of a royal ſaint, which, under his name,
has been delineated by the zeal and gratitude
of Euſebius, the moſt indulgent reader will
confeſs, that when I ſtyled him a <hi>courtly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0162400600:145"/>
for the epiſcopal character from the uſe of a
much harſher epithet. The other appellation
of a <hi>paſſionate declaimer,</hi> which ſeems to have
ſounded ſtill more offenſive in the tender ears
of Dr. Chelſum<note n="8" place="bottom">Chelſum, p. 234.</note>, was not applied by me to
Euſebius, but to Lactantius, or rather to the
author of the hiſtorical declamation, <hi>De mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
perſecutorum</hi>; and indeed it is much more
properly adapted to the Rhetorician, than to
the Biſhop. Each of thoſe authors was alike
ſtudious of the glory of Conſtantine; but each
of them directed the torrent of his invectives
againſt the tyrant, whether Maxentius or Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
whoſe recent defeat was the actual theme
of popular and Chriſtian applauſe. This ſimple
obſervation may ſerve to extinguiſh a very
trifling objection of my critic, That Euſebius
has not repreſented the tyrant Maxentius under
the character of a Perſecutor.</p>
               <p>Without ſcrutinizing the conſiderations of
intereſt which might ſupport the integrity of
Baronius and Tillemont, I may fairly obſerve,
that both thoſe learned Catholics have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and condemned the diſſimulation
of Euſebius, which is partly denied, and partly
juſtified, by my adverſary. The honourable
reflection of Baronius well deſerves to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.

offenſive, which is alike incapable of
wounding or of correcting, as it ſeems to have
no fixed object or certain aim. Juvenal might
have read his ſatire againſt women in a circle
of Roman ladies, and each of them might have
liſtened with pleaſure to the amuſing deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the various vices and follies, from
which ſhe herſelf was ſo perfectly free. The

enjoy a ſtill more ample latitude of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective;
and as long as they abſtain from any

and even exaggerate, the ſins of the multitude.
The precepts of Chriſtianity ſeem to inculcate
a ſtyle of mortification, of abaſement, of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contempt;
and the hypocrite who aſpires to
the reputation of a ſaint, often finds it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to affect the language of a penitent. I
ſhould doubt whether Dr. Chelſum is much
acquainted with the comedies of Moliere. If
he has ever read that inimitable maſter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

was very much inclined to confeſs his real guilt,

               <p>It is not my intention to compare the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Tartuffe with that of Euſebius; the
former pointed his invectives againſt himſelf,
the latter directed them againſt the times in
which he had lived: but as the prudent Biſhop
of Caeſarea did not ſpecify any place or perſon
for the object of his cenſure, he cannot juſtly
be accuſed, even by his friends, of violating
the <hi>profitable</hi> plan of his <hi>didactic</hi> hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The extreme caution of Euſebius, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
any mention of thoſe who were tempted
and who fell during the perſecution, has coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
a ſuſpicion that he himſelf was one of
thoſe unhappy victims, and that his tenderneſs
for the wounded fame of his brethren aroſe
from a juſt apprehenſion of his own diſgrace.
In one of my notes<note n="1" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 699, N. 178.</note>, I had obſerved, that he
was charged with the guilt of ſome criminal
compliances, in his own preſence, and in the
Council of Tyre. I am therefore accountable
for the reality only, and not for the truth, of
the accuſation: but as the two Doctors, who
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0162400600:149"/>
on this occaſion unite their forces, are angry
and clamorous in aſſerting the innocence of the
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian<note n="2" place="bottom">Chelſum and Randolph, p. 236, 237, 238.</note>, I ſhall advance one
ſtep farther, and ſhall maintain, that the charge
againſt Euſebius, though not legally proved,
is ſupported by a reaſonable ſhare of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive
evidence.</p>
               <p>I have often wondered why our orthodox
Divines ſhould be ſo earneſt and zealous in the
defence of Euſebius; whoſe moral character
cannot be preſerved, unleſs by the ſacrifice of
a more illuſtrious, and, as I really believe, of
a more innocent victim. Either the Biſhop of
Caeſarea, on a very important occaſion, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the laws of Chriſtian charity and civil
juſtice, or we muſt fix a charge of calumny,
almoſt of forgery, on the head of the great
Athanaſius, the ſtandard-bearer of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouſian
cauſe, and the firmeſt pillar of the
orthodox doctrine. In the Council of Tyre,
he was accuſed of murdering, or at leaſt of
mutilating, a Biſhop, whom he produced at
Tyre alive and unhurt (Athanaſ. tom. i.
p. 783. 786.); and of ſacrilegiouſly breaking
a conſecrated chalice, in a village where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
church, nor altar, nor chalice, could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
have exiſted. (Athanaſ. tom. i. p. 731,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0162400600:150"/>
732. 802.) Notwithſtanding the cleareſt proofs
of his innocence, Athanaſius was oppreſſed by
the Arian faction; and Euſebius of Caeſarea,
the venerable father of eccleſiaſtical hiſtory,
conducted this iniquitous proſecution from a
motive of perſonal enmity. (Athanaſ. tom. i.
p. 728. 795. 797.) Four years afterwards, a
national council of the Biſhops of Egypt, forty-nine
of whom had been preſent at the Synod of
Tyre, addreſſed an epiſtle or manifeſto in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Athanaſius to all the Biſhops of the
Chriſtian world. In this epiſtle they aſſert,
that ſome of the Confeſſors, who accompanied
them to Tyre, had accuſed Euſebius of Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea
of an act relative to idolatrous ſacrifice.

a conſonant but more circumſtantial nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of the accuſation of Euſebius may be
found in the writings of Epiphanius (Haereſ.
lxviii. p. 723, 724.), the learned Biſhop of
Salamis, who was born about the time of the
Synod of Tyre. He relates, that, in one of the
ſeſſions of the Council, Potamon, Biſhop of
Heracica in Egypt, addreſſed Euſebius in the
following words: <q rend="inline">How now, Euſebius, can
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0162400600:151"/>
this be borne, that you ſhould be ſeated as
a judge, while the innocent Athanaſius
is left ſtanding as a criminal? Tell me,
continued Potamon, were we not in priſon
together during the perſecution? For my
own part, I loſt an eye for the ſake of the
truth; but I cannot diſcern that <hi>you</hi> have
loſt any one of your members. You bear
not any marks of your ſufferings for Jeſus
Chriſt; but here you are, full of life, and
with all the parts of your body ſound and
entire. How could you contrive to eſcape
from priſon, unleſs you ſtained your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
either by actual guilt or by a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
promiſe to our perſecutors.</q> Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
immediately broke up the meeting, and
diſcovered by his anger, that he was confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or provoked by the reproaches of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
Potamon.</p>
               <p>I ſhould deſpiſe myſelf, if I were capable of
magnifying, for a preſent occaſion, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the witneſs whom I have produced. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamon
was moſt aſſuredly actuated by a ſtrong
prejudice againſt the perſonal enemy of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;
and if the tranſaction to which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
had been of a private and doubtful kind,
I would not take any ungenerous advantage
of the reſpect which my Reverend Adverſaries
muſt entertain for the character of a Confeſſor.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0162400600:152"/>
But I cannot diſtruſt the veracity of Potamon,
when he confined himſelf to the aſſertion of a
fact, which lay within the compaſs of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
knowledge: and collateral teſtimony (ſee
Photius, p. 296, 297.) atteſts, that Euſebius
was long enough in priſon to aſſiſt his friend,
the Martyr Pamphilus, in compoſing the firſt
five books of his Apology for Origen. If we
admit that Euſebius was impriſoned, he muſt
have been diſcharged, and his diſcharge muſt
have been either honourable, or criminal, or
innocent. If his patience vanquiſhed the cruelty
of the Tyrant's Miniſters, a ſhort relation of his
own confeſſion and ſufferings would have formed
an uſeful and edifying Chapter in his Didactic
Hiſtory of the Perſecution of Paleſtine; and
the Reader would have been ſatisfied of the
veracity of an Hiſtorian who valued truth above
his life. If it had been in his power to juſtify,
or even to excuſe, the manner of his diſcharge
from priſon, it was his intereſt, it was his duty,
to prevent the doubts and ſuſpicions which
muſt ariſe from his ſilence under theſe delicate
circumſtances. Notwithſtanding theſe urgent
reaſons, Euſebius has obſerved a profound, and
perhaps a prudent, ſilence: though he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
celebrates the merit and martyrdom
of his friend Pamphilus (p. 371. 394. 419. 427.
Edit. Cantab.), he never inſinuates that he was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0162400600:153"/>
his companion in priſon; and while he copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
deſcribes the eight years perſecution in
Paleſtine, he never repreſents himſelf in any
other light than of a ſpectator. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
in a Writer, who relates with a viſible ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
the honourable events of his own life,
if it be not abſolutely conſidered as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of conſcious guilt, muſt excite, and may
juſtify, the ſuſpicions of the moſt candid Critic.</p>
               <p>Yet the firmneſs of Dr. Randolph is not
ſhaken by theſe rational ſuſpicions; and he
condeſcends, in a magiſterial tone, to inform
me, <q rend="inline">That it is highly improbable, from the
general well-known deciſion of the Church
in ſuch caſes, that had his apoſtacy been
known, he would have riſen to thoſe high
honours which he attained, or been admitted
at all indeed to any other than lay-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</q>
This weighty objection did not
ſurprize me, as I had already ſeen the ſubſtance
of it in the Prolegomena of Valeſius; but I
ſafely diſregarded a difficulty which had not
appeared of any moment to the national coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Egypt; and I ſtill think that an hundred
Biſhops, with Athanaſius at their head, were
as competent judges of the diſcipline of the
fourth Century, as even the Lady Margaret's
Profeſſor of Divinity in the Univerſity of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.
As a work of ſupererogation, I have
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0162400600:154"/>
conſulted, however, the Antiquities of Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
(ſee l. iv. c. 3. ſ. 6, 7. vol. i. p. 144, &amp;c.
fol. Edit.), and found, as I expected, that
much real learning had made him cautious and
modeſt. After a careful examination of the
facts and authorities already known to me, and
of thoſe with which I was ſupplied by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Antiquarian, I am perſuaded that the
theory and the practice of diſcipline were not
invariably the ſame, that particular examples
cannot always be reconciled with general
rules, and that the ſtern laws of juſtice often
yielded to motives of policy and convenience.
The temper of Jerom towards thoſe whom he
conſidered as Heretics was fierce and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;
yet the Dialogue of Jerom againſt the
Luciferians, which I have read with infinite
pleaſure (tom. ii. p. 135—147. Edit. Baſil.
1536.), is the ſeaſonable and dextrous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of a Stateſman, who felt the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency
of ſoothing and reconciling a numerous
party of offenders. The moſt rigid diſcipline,
with regard to the Eccleſiaſtics who had fallen
in time of perſecution, is expreſſed in the 10th
Canon of the Council of Nice; the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
indulgence was ſhewn by the Fathers
of the ſame Council to the <hi>lapſed,</hi> the degraded,
the ſchiſmatic Biſhops of Lycopolis. Of the
penitent ſinners, ſome might eſcape the ſhame
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0162400600:155"/>
of a public conviction or confeſſion, and others
might be exempted from the rigour of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
puniſhment. If Euſebius incurred the
guilt of a ſacrilegious promiſe (for we are free
to accept the milder alternative of Potamon),
the proofs of this criminal tranſaction might
be ſuppreſſed by the influence of money or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
a ſeaſonable journey into Egypt might
allow time for the popular rumours to ſubſide.
The crime of Euſebius might be protected by
the impunity of many Epiſcopal Apoſtates
(ſee Philoſtorg. l. ii. c. 15. p. 21. Edit. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thofred.);
and the Governors of the Church
very reaſonably deſired to retain in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
the moſt learned Chriſtian of the Age.</p>

            <p>WHILE the ſheets of this Vindication
were in the preſs, I was informed that
an anonymous pamphlet, under the title of <hi>A
Few Remarks,</hi> &amp;c. had been publiſhed againſt
my Hiſtory in the courſe of the laſt ſummer.
The unknown writer has thought proper to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
himſelf by the emphatic, yet vague,
appellation of A GENTLEMAN: but I muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that he has not conſidered, with becoming
attention, the duties of that reſpectable charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I am ignorant of the motives which can
urge a man of a liberal mind, and liberal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to attack without provocation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tenderneſs, any work which may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the information, or even to the
amuſement of the public. But I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that the author of ſuch a work, who
boldly gives his name and his labours to the
world, impoſes on his adverſaries the fair and
honourable obligation of encountering him in
open day-light, and of ſupporting the weight
of their aſſertions by the credit of their names.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0162400600:158"/>
The effuſions of wit, or the productions of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
may be accepted from a ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
hand. The critic who attempts to
injure the reputation of another, by ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
which may poſſibly be falſe, ſhould
renounce the ungenerous hope of concealing
behind a maſk the vexation of diſappointment,
and the guilty bluſh of detection.</p>
            <p>After this remark, which I cannot make
without ſome degree of concern, I ſhall frankly
declare, that it is not my wiſh or my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to proſecute with this <hi>Gentleman</hi> a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
altercation. There lies between us a
broad and unfathomable gulph; and the heavy
miſt of prejudice and ſuperſtition, which has in
a great meaſure been diſpelled by the free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
of the preſent age, ſtill continues to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
the mind of my Adverſary. He fondly
embraces thoſe phantoms (for inſtance, an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Pilate<note n="1" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 100.</note>), which can ſcarcely find a
ſhelter in the gloom of an Italian convent; and
the reſentment which he points againſt me,
might frequently be extended to the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
of the PROTESTANT, or, in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
of the HERETICAL critics. His obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are divided into a number of unconnected
paragraphs, each of which contains ſome quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
from my Hiſtory, and the angry, yet
commonly trifling expreſſion of his diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0162400600:159"/>
and diſpleaſure. Thoſe ſentiments I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hope to remove; and as the religious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of this <hi>Gentleman</hi> are principally founded
on the infallibility of the Church<note n="2" place="bottom">Remarks p. 15.</note>, they are
not calculated to make a very deep impreſſion
on the mind of an Engliſh reader. The view of
<hi>facts</hi> will be materially affected by the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
influence of <hi>doctrines.</hi> The man who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
to judge of the conduct of Lewis XIV.
and Charles V. towards their Proteſtant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects<note n="3" place="bottom">Id. p. 111.</note>, declares himſelf incapable of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
the limits of perſecution and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The devout Papiſt, who has implored
on his knees the interceſſion of St. Cyprian,
will ſeldom preſume to examine the actions of
the Saint by the rules of hiſtorical evidence and
of moral propriety. Inſtead of the homely
likeneſs which I had exhibited of the Biſhop of
Carthage, my Adverſary has ſubſtituted a life
of Cyprian<note n="4" place="bottom">Id. p. 72—88.</note>, full of what the French call
<hi>onction,</hi> and the Engliſh, <hi>canting</hi> (See Jortin's
Remarks, Vol. ii. p. 239.): to which I can
only reply, that thoſe who are diſſatisfied with
the principles of Moſheim and Le Clerc, <hi>muſt</hi>
view with eyes very different from mine, the
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the third century.</p>
            <p>It would be an <hi>endleſs</hi> diſcuſſion (<hi>endleſs</hi> in
every ſenſe of the word), were I to examine the
cavils which ſtart up and expire in every page
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0162400600:160"/>
of this criticiſm, on the inexhauſtible topic of
opinions, characters, and intentions. Moſt of
the inſtances which are here produced, are of
ſo brittle a ſubſtance that they fall in pieces as
ſoon as they are touched: and I ſearched for
ſome time before I was able to diſcover an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of ſome moment where the <hi>Gentleman</hi>
had fairly ſtaked his veracity againſt ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
fact aſſerted in the two laſt Chapters of
my Hiſtory. At laſt I perceived that he has
abſolutely denied<note n="5" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 90, 91.</note> that any thing can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from the Epiſtles of St. Cyprian, or from
his treatiſe <hi>De Unitate Eccleſiae,</hi> to which I had
referred, to juſtify my account of the ſpiritual
pride and licentious manners of ſome of the
Confeſſors<note n="6" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 661, Note 91.</note>. As the <hi>numbers</hi> of the Epiſtles
are not the ſame in the edition of Pamelius and
in that of Fell, the Critic may be excuſed for
miſtaking my quotations, if he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that he was ignorant of eccleſiaſtical
hiſtory, and that he never heard of the troubles
excited by the ſpiritual pride of the Confeſſors,
who uſurped the privilege of giving letters of
communion to penitent ſinners. But my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the treatiſe <hi>De Unitate Eccleſiae</hi> was
clear and direct; the treatiſe itſelf contains
only ten pages, and the following words might
be diſtinctly read by any perſon who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Latin language. "Nec quiſquam
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0162400600:161"/>
miretur, dilectiſſimi fratres, etiam de confeſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus
quoſdam ad iſta procedere, inde quoque
aliquos tam nefanda tam gravia peccare. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
enim confeſſio immunem facit ab inſidiis
diaboli; aut contra tentationes, et pericula, et
incurſus atque impetus ſeculares adhuc in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo
poſitum perpetuâ ſecuritate defendit: ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum
nunquam in confeſſoribus, <hi>fraudes,</hi> et
<hi>ſtupra,</hi> et <hi>adulteria</hi> poſtmodum videremus, quae
nunc in quibuſdam videntes ingemiſcimus et
dolemus." This formal declaration of Cyprian,
which is followed by ſeveral long periods of
admonition and cenſure, is alone ſufficient to
expoſe the ſcandalous vices of ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
and the diſingenuous behaviour of my
concealed adverſary.</p>
            <p>After this example, which I have fairly
choſen as one of the moſt ſpecious and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
of his objections, the candid Reader would
excuſe me, if from this moment I declined <hi>the
Gentleman</hi>'s acquaintance. But as two topics
have occurred, which are intimately connected
with the ſubject of the preceding ſheets, I ſhall
inſert them in this place, and deſire that they
may be read as the concluſion of the fourth
article of my anſwers to Mr. Davis, and of the
firſt article of my reply to the confederate Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Chelſum and Randolph.</p>
            <div type="article">

               <p>I ſtand accuſed, though not indeed by Mr.
Davis, for profanely depreciating the <hi>promiſed</hi>
Land, as well as the <hi>choſen</hi> People. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
without a name has placed this charge
in the front of his battle<note n="1" place="bottom">Remarks, p. 1.</note>, and if my memory
does not deceive me, it is one of the few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
in Mr. Apthorpe's book, which have
any immediate relation to my Hiſtory. They
ſeem to conſider as a reproach, and as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
reproach, the idea which I had given of
Paleſtine, as of a territory ſcarcely ſuperior to
Wales in extent and fertility<note n="2" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 30.</note>; and they
ſtrangely convert a geographical obſervation
into a theological error. When I recollect
that the imputation of a ſimilar error was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by the implacable Calvin, to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and to juſtify the execution of Servetus,
I muſt applaud the felicity of this country, and
of this age, which has diſarmed, if it could
not mollify, the fierceneſs of eccleſiaſtical cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm
(ſee Dictionnaire Critique de Chauffepié,
tom. iv. p. 223).</p>
               <p>As I had compared the narrow extent of
Phoenicia and Paleſtine with the important bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings
which thoſe celebrated countries had dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
over the reſt of the earth, their minute ſize
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0162400600:163"/>
became an object not of cenſure but of praiſe.
<q>Ingentes animos anguſto in pectore verſant.</q>
The preciſe meaſure of Paleſtine was taken
from Templeman's Survey of the Globe: he
allows to Wales 7011 ſquare Engliſh miles, to
the Morea, or Peloponneſus, 7220, to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
United Provinces 7546, and to Judaea or
Paleſtine 7600. The difference is not very
conſiderable, and if any of theſe countries has
been magnified beyond its real ſize, Aſia is
more liable than Europe to have been affected
by the inaccuracy of Mr. Templeman's maps.
To the authority of this modern ſurvey, I ſhall
only add the ancient and weighty teſtimony of
Jerom, who paſſed in Paleſtine above thirty
years of his life. From Dan to Berſhebah, the
two fixed and proverbial boundaries of the Holy
Land, he reckons no more than one hundred
and ſixty miles (Hieronym. ad Dardanum,
tom. iii. p. 66), and the breadth of Paleſtine
cannot by any expedient be ſtretched to one
half of its length (ſee Reland, Paleſtin. l. ii.
c. 5. p. 421).</p>
               <p>The degrees and limits of fertility cannot
be aſcertained with the ſtrict ſimplicity of geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical
meaſures. Whenever we ſpeak of
the productions of the earth in different cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
our ideas muſt be relative, our expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
vague and doubtful; nor can we always
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0162400600:164"/>
diſtinguiſh between the gifts of Nature and
the rewards of Induſtry. The Emperor Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick
II. the enemy and the victim of the
Clergy, is accuſed of ſaying, after his return
from his Cruſade, that the God of the Jews
would have deſpiſed his promiſed land, if he
had once ſeen the fruitful realms of Sicily
and Naples (ſee Giannone Iſtoria Civile del
Regno di Napoli, tom. ii. p. 245). This raillery,
which malice has perhaps falſely imputed to
Frederick, is inconſiſtent with truth and piety;
yet it muſt be confeſſed, that the ſoil of Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
does not contain that inexhauſtible, and
as it were ſpontaneous principle of ſecundity
which under the moſt unfavourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
has covered with rich harveſts the banks
of the Nile, the fields of Sicily, or the plains
of Poland. The Jordan is the only navigable
river of Paleſtine: a conſiderable part of the
narrow ſpace is occupied, or rather loſt, in the
<hi>Dead Sea,</hi> whoſe horrid aſpect inſpires every
ſenſation of diſguſt, and countenances every
tale of horror. The diſtricts which border on
Arabia partake of the ſandy quality of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
deſert. The face of the country, except
the ſea-coaſt and the valley of the Jordan, is
covered with mountains, which appear for the
moſt part as naked and barren rocks; and in
the neighbourhood of Jeruſalem there is a real
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0162400600:165"/>
ſcarcity of the two elements of earth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(ſee Maundrel's Travels, p. 65, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Paleſtin. tom. i. p. 238—395). Theſe
diſadvantages, which now operate in their
fulleſt extent, were formerly corrected by the
labours of a numerous people, and the active
protection of a wiſe government. The hills
were cloathed with rich beds of artificial mould,
the rain was collected in vaſt ciſterns, a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of freſh water was conveyed by pipes and
aqueducts to the dry lands, the breed of cattle
was encouraged in thoſe parts which were not
adapted for tillage, and almoſt every ſpot was
compelled to yield ſome production for the uſe
of the inhabitants. (See the ſame teſtimonies
and obſervations of Maundrel and Reland).<q>

                  </q> Such are the uſeful victories which have been
atchieved by MAN on the lofty mountains of
Switzerland, along the rocky coaſt of Genoa,
and upon the barren hills of Paleſtine; and
ſince Wales has flouriſhed under the influence
of Engliſh freedom, that rugged country has
ſurely acquired ſome ſhare of the ſame induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
merit and the ſame artificial fertility.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0162400600:166"/>
Thoſe Critics who interpret the compariſon of
Paleſtine and Wales as a tacit libel on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
are themſelves guilty of an unjuſt ſatire
againſt the latter of thoſe countries. Such is
the injuſtice of Mr. Apthorpe and of the ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous
<hi>Gentleman:</hi> but if Mr. Davis (as we
may ſuſpect from his name) is himſelf of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian

has protected me from his zeal.</p>

               <p>Yet I ſhall not attempt to conceal a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
army of Chriſtians and even of Martyrs,
which is ready to inliſt under the banners of the
confederate Doctors, if they will accept their
ſervice. As a ſpecimen of the extravagant
legends of the middle age, I had produced the
inſtance of ten thouſand Chriſtian ſoldiers ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to have been crucified on Mount Ararat,
by the order either of Trajan or Hadrian<note n="1" place="bottom">Gibbon, p. 654. note 74.</note>.
For the mention and for the confutation of this
ſtory, I had appealed to a Papiſt and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
to the learned Tillemont (Mem. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſt.
tom. ii. part ii. p. 438), and to the
diligent Geddes (Miſcellanies, vol. ii. p. 203),
and when Tillemont was not afraid to ſay that
there are few hiſtories which appear more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0162400600:167"/>
I was not aſhamed of diſmiſſing the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
with ſilent contempt. We may trace the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of fiction as well as thoſe of credibility, and
the impartial Critic will not place on the ſame
level the baptiſm of Philip and the donation of
Conſtantine. But in conſidering the crucifix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
of the ten thouſand Chriſtian ſoldiers, we
are not reduced to the neceſſity of weighing
any internal probabilities, or of diſproving any
external teſtimonies. This legend, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
of which muſt ſtrike every <hi>rational</hi> mind,
ſtands naked and unſupported by the authority
of any writer who lived within a thouſand years
of the age of Trajan, and has not been able to
obtain the poor ſanction of the uncorrupted
Martyrologies which were framed in the moſt
credulous period of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.
The two Proteſtant Doctors will probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
