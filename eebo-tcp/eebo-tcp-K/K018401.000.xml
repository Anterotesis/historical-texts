            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE GOOD NATUR'D MAN: A COMEDY. As Performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.</p>
            <p>BY MR. GOLDSMITH.</p>
            <p>LONDON: Printed for W. GRIFFIN, in Catharine-Street, Strand. MDCCLXVIII.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN I undertook to write a comedy, I confeſs I was ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in favour of the poets of the laſt age, and ſtrove to imitate them. The term, <hi>genteel comedy,</hi> was then unknown amongſt us, and little more was deſired by an audience, than nature and humour, in whatever walks of life they were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. The author of the following ſcenes never imagined that more would be expected of him, and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim. Thoſe who know any thing of compoſition, are ſenſible, that in purſuing humour, it will ſometimes lead us into the receſſes of the mean; I was even tempted to look for it in the maſter of a ſpunging-houſe: but in deference to the public taſte, grown of late, perhaps, too delicate; the ſcene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the repreſentation. In deference alſo to the judgment of a few friends, who think in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way, the ſcene is here reſtored. The author ſubmits it to the reader in his cloſet; and hopes that too much refinement will not baniſh humour and character from our's, as it has already done from the French theatre. Indeed the French comedy is now become ſo very elevated and ſentimental, that it has not only baniſhed humour and <hi>Moliere</hi> from the ſtage, but it has baniſhed all ſpectators too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1241002300:3"/>
Upon the whole, the author returns his thanks to the public for the favourable reception which the Good Natur'd Man has met with; and to Mr. Colman in particular, for his kindneſs to it. It may not alſo be improper to aſſure any, who ſhall hereafter write for the theatre, that merit, or ſuppoſed merit, will ever be a ſufficient paſſport to his protection.</p>

            <l>Uncheck'd on both, loud rabbles vent their rage,</l>

            <stage>Enter SIR WILLIAM HONEYWOOD, JARVIS.</stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>GOOD Jarvis, make no apologies for this honeſt bluntneſs. Fidelity, like yours, is the beſt excuſe for every freedom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jarvis.</speaker>
               <p>I can't help being blunt, and being very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry too, when I hear you talk of diſinheriting ſo good, ſo worthy a young gentleman as your nephew, my maſter. All the world loves him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Say rather, that he loves all the world; that is his fault.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jarvis.</speaker>
               <p>I'm ſure there is no part of it more dear to him than you are, tho' he has not ſeen you ſince he was a child.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>What ſignifies his affection to me, or how can I be proud of a place in a heart where every ſharper and coxcomb find an eaſy entrance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jarvis.</speaker>
               <p>I grant you that he's rather too good natur'd; that he's too much every man's man; that he laughs this minute with one, and cries the next with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but whoſe inſtructions may he thank for all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Not mine, ſure? My letters to him during my employment in Italy, taught him only that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy which might prevent, not defend his errors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1241002300:7"/>
               <speaker>Jarvis.</speaker>
               <p>Faith, begging your honour's pardon, I'm ſorry they taught him any philoſophy at all; it has only ſerv'd to ſpoil him. This ſame philoſophy is a good horſe in the ſtable, but an errant jade on a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. For my own part, whenever I hear him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the name on't, I'm always ſure he's going to play the fool.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Don't let us aſcribe his faults to his philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, I entreat you. No, Jarvis, his good nature ariſes rather from his fears of offending the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, than his deſire of making the deſerving happy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jarvis.</speaker>
               <p>What it riſes from, I don't know. But, to be ſure, every body has it, that aſks it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, or that does not aſk it. I have been now for ſome time a concealed ſpectator of his follies, and find them as boundleſs as his diſſipation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jarvis.</speaker>
               <p>And yet, faith, he has ſome fine name or other for them all. He calls his extravagance, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity; and his truſting every body, univerſal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. It was but laſt week he went ſecurity for a fellow whoſe face he ſcarce knew, and that he call'd an act of exalted mu—mu—munificence; ay, that was the name he gave it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>And upon that I proceed, as my laſt effort, tho' with very little hopes to reclaim him. That very fellow has juſt abſconded, and I have taken up the ſecurity. Now, my intention is to involve him in fictitious diſtreſs, before he has plunged himſelf into real calamity. To arreſt him for that very debt, to clap an officer upon him, and then let him ſee which of his friends will come to his relief.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jarvis.</speaker>
               <p>Well, if I could but any way ſee him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly vexed, every groan of his would be muſic to me; yet faith, I believe it impoſſible. I have tried to fret him myſelf every morning theſe three years; but, inſtead of being angry, he ſits as calmly to hear me ſcold, as he does to his hair-dreſſer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>We muſt try him once more, however, and I'll go this inſtant to put my ſcheme into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I don't deſpair of ſucceeding, as, by your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1241002300:8"/>
means, I can have frequent opportunities of being about him, without being known. What a pity it is, Jarvis, that any man's good will to others ſhould produce ſo much neglect of himſelf, as to require correction. Yet, we muſt touch his weakneſſes with a delicate hand. There are ſome faults ſo nearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to excellence, that we can ſcarce weed out the vice without eradicating the virtue.</p>

               <p>Olivia not his ſiſter? Olivia not Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's ſiſter? You amaze me!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Garnet.</speaker>
               <p>No more his ſiſter than I am, I had it all from his own ſervant; I can get any thing from that quarter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>But how? Tell me again, Garnet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Garnet.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Madam, as I told you before, inſtead of going to Lyons to bring home his ſiſter, who has been there with her aunt theſe ten years he never went further than Paris; there he ſaw and fell in love with this young lady; by the bye, of a prodigious family.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>And brought her home to my guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, as his daughter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Garnet.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and daughter ſhe will be; if he don't conſent to their marriage, they talk of trying what a Scotch parſon can do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I own they have deceived me—And ſo demurely as Olivia carried it too!—Would you believe it, Garnet, I told her all my ſecrets; and yet the ſly cheat concealed all this from me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Garnet.</speaker>
               <p>And, upon my word, Madam, I don't much blame her; ſhe was loath to truſt one with her ſecrets, that was ſo very bad at keeping her own.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>But, to add to their deceit, the young gentleman, it ſeems, pretends to make me ſerious propoſals. My guardian and he are to be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, to open the affair in form. You know I am to loſe half my fortune if I refuſe him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Garnet.</speaker>
               <p>Yet, what can you do? For being, as you are, in love with Mr. Honeywood, Madam—</p>

               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>How! ideot; what do you mean? In love with Mr. Honeywood! Is this to provoke me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gar.</speaker>
               <p>That is, Madam, in friendſhip with him; I meant nothing more than friendſhip, as I hope to be married; nothing more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>Well, no more of this! As to my guardian, and his ſon, they ſhall find me prepared to receive them; I'm reſolved to accept their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal with ſeeming pleaſure, to mortify them by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, and ſo throw the refuſal at laſt upon them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gar.</speaker>
               <p>Delicious! and that will ſecure your whole fortune to yourſelf. Well, who could have thought ſo innocent a face could cover ſo much cuteneſs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>Why, girl, I only oppoſe my prudence to their cunning, and practiſe a leſſon they have taught me againſt themſelves.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gar.</speaker>
               <p>Then you're likely not long to want employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for here they come, and in cloſe conference.</p>

               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>Lord! good Sir, moderate your fears; you're ſo plaguy ſhy, that one would think you had changed ſexes. I tell you we muſt have the half or the whole. Come, let me ſee with what ſpirit you begin? Well, why don't you? Eh! What? Well then—I muſt, it ſeems—Miſs Richland, my dear, I believe you gueſs at our buſineſs; an affair which my ſon here comes to open, that nearly concerns your happineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I ſhould be ungrateful not to be pleaſed with any thing that comes recommended by you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>How, boy, could you deſire a finer open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Why don't you begin, I ſay?</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Leont.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, Madam, my father, Madam, has ſome intentions—hem—of explaining an affair—which—himſelf—can beſt explain, Madam.</p>

               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my dear; it comes intirely from my ſon; it's all a requeſt of his own, Madam. And I will permit him to make the beſt of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Leont.</speaker>
               <p>The whole affair is only this, Madam; my father has a propoſal to make, which he inſiſts none but himſelf ſhall deliver.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>My mind miſgives me, the fellow will never be brought on. <stage>(Aſide.)</stage> In ſhort, Madam, you ſee before you one that loves you; one whoſe whole hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is all in you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>I never had any doubts of your regard, Sir; and I hope you can have none of my duty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>That's not the thing, my little ſweeting; my love! No, no, another gueſs lover than I; there he ſtands, Madam; his very looks declare the force of his paſſion—Call up a look, you dog. But then, had you ſeen him, as I have, weeping, ſpeaking ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquies and blank verſe, ſometimes melancholy, and ſometimes abſent—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>I fear, Sir, he's abſent now; or ſuch a declaration would have come moſt properly from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>Himſelf, Madam; he would die before he could make ſuch a confeſſion; and if he had not a channel for his paſſion thro' me, it would ere now have drowned his underſtanding.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt grant, Sir, there are attractions in modeſt diffidence, above the force of words. A ſilent addreſs is the genuine eloquence of ſincerity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>Madam, he has forgot to ſpeak any other language; ſilence is become his mother tongue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>And it muſt be confeſſed, Sir, it ſpeaks very powerfully in his favour. And yet, I ſhall be thought too forward in making ſuch a confeſſion; ſhan't I Mr. Leontine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Leont.</speaker>
               <p>Confuſion! my reſerve will undo me. But, if modeſty attracts her, impudence may diſguſt her. I'll try. <stage>(Aſide.)</stage> Don't imagine from my ſilence, Madam, that I want a due ſenſe of the honour and happineſs intended me. My father, Madam, tells
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1241002300:26"/>
me, your humble ſervant is not totally indifferent to you. He admires you; I adore you; and when we come together, upon my ſoul I believe we ſhall be the happieſt couple in all St. James's.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Leont.</speaker>
               <p>Doubt my ſincerity, Madam? By your dear ſelf I ſwear. Aſk the brave if they deſire glory; aſk cowards if they covet ſafety—</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>Aſk a fool if he can talk nonſenſe! What's come over the boy. What ſignifies aſking, when there's not a ſoul to give you an anſwer? If you would aſk to the purpoſe, aſk this lady's conſent to make you happy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>Why indeed, Sir, his uncommon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour almoſt compels me, forces me, to comply. And yet I'm afraid he'll deſpiſe a conqueſt gain'd with too much eaſe; wont you Mr. Leontine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Leont.</speaker>
               <p>Confuſion! <stage>(Aſide.)</stage> O by no means, Madam, by no means. And yet, Madam, you talk'd of force. There is nothing I would avoid ſo much as compulſion in a thing of this kind. No, Madam, I will ſtill be generous, and leave you at liberty to refuſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>But I tell you, Sir, the lady is not at liberty. Its a match. You ſee ſhe ſays nothing. Silence gives conſent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Leont.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, ſhe talk'd of force. Conſider, Sir, the cruelty of conſtraining her inclinations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Croaker.</speaker>
               <p>But I ſay there's no cruelty. Don't you know, blockhead, that girls have always a roundabout way of ſaying yes before company? So get you both gone together into the next room, and hang him that interrupts the tender explanation. Get you gone, I ſay; I'll not hear a word.</p>

               <p>DEAR NICK, <hi>An Engliſh gentleman, of large fortune, has for ſome time made private, tho' honourable propoſals to your daughter Olivia. They love each other tenderly, and I find ſhe has conſented, without letting any of the family know, to crown his addreſſes. As ſuch good offers don't come every day, your own good ſenſe, his large fortune, and family conſiderations, will induce you to forgive her—Yours ever—</hi>RACHEL CROAKER.</p>
               <p>My daughter, Olivia, privately contracted to a man of large fortune! This is good news indeed. Oh! My heart never foretold me of this. And yet, how ſlily the little baggage has carried it ſince ſhe came home. Not a word on't to the old ones for the world. Yet, I thought, I ſaw ſomething ſhe wanted to conceal.</p>

ſcruple <stage>(pulling out his purſe).</stage> The thing is only this: I believe I ſhall be able to diſcharge this trifle in two or three days at fartheſt; but, as I would not have the affair known for the world, I have thought of keeping you, and your good friend here, about me till the debt is diſcharged; for which, I ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly grateful.</p>

               <p>Yet, Mr. Honeywood, this does not convince me but that ſeverity in criticiſm is neceſſary. It was our firſt adopting the ſeverity of French taſte, that has brought them in turn to taſte us.</p>

               <p>Ah; the vulgar rogues, all will be out. Right, gentlemen, very right upon my word, and quite to the purpoſe. They draw a parallel, Madam, between the mental taſte, and that of our ſenſes. We are injur'd as much by French ſeverity in the one, as by French rapacity in the other. That's their meaning.</p>

               <p>It muſt come, Sir, with a very ill grace from you. To cenſure it, after what you have done, would look like malice; and to ſpeak favourably of a character you have oppreſſed, would be impeaching your own.

               <p> We have indeed been long acquainted, Sir; very long. If I remember, our firſt meeting was at the French ambaſſador's.—Do you recollect how you were pleas'd to rally me upon my complexion there?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Honeyw.</speaker>
               <p>Perfectly, madam; I preſum'd to reprove you for painting: but your warmer bluſhes ſoon convinc'd the company, that the colouring was all from nature.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>And yet you only meant it, in your good natur'd way, to make me pay a compliment to myſelf. In the ſame manner you danc'd that night with the moſt aukward woman in company, becauſe you ſaw nobody elſe would take her out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Honeyw.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; and was rewarded the next night, by dancing with the fineſt woman in company, that every body wiſh'd to take out.</p>

               <p>Well, Sir, if you thought ſo then, I fear your judgment has ſince corrected the errors of a firſt impreſſion. We generally ſhew to moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at firſt. Our ſex are like poor tradeſmen, that put all their beſt goods to be ſeen at the windows.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Honeyw.</speaker>
               <p>The firſt impreſſion, Madam, did indeed deceive me. I expected to find a woman with all the faults of conſcious flattered beauty. I expected to find her vain and inſolent. But every day has ſince taught me that it is poſſible to poſſeſs ſenſe without pride, and beauty without affectation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>This, Sir, is a ſtyle very unuſual with Mr. Honeywood; and I ſhould be glad to know why he thus attempts to encreaſe that vanity, which his own leſſons taught me to deſpiſe.</p>

               <speaker>Honeyw.</speaker>
               <p>I aſk pardon, Madam. Yet, from our long friendſhip, I preſumed I might have ſome right to offer, without offence, what you may refuſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I own my raſhneſs; but, as I plead the cauſe of friendſhip, of one who loves.—Don't be alarmed, Madam.—Who loves you with the moſt ardent paſſion; whoſe whole happineſs is placed in you—</p>

               <speaker>Honeyw.</speaker>
               <p>Ah, Madam, it but too plainly points him out. Tho' he ſhould be too humble himſelf to urge his pretenſions, or you too modeſt to underſtand them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miſs Rich.</speaker>
               <p>Well; it would be affectation any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to pretend ignorance; and, I will own, Sir, I have long been prejudiced in his favour. It was but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to wiſh to make his heart mine, as he ſeem'd himſelf ignorant of its value.</p>

               <p>Mr. Honeywood, let me tell you, that you wrong my ſentiments and yourſelf. When I firſt applied to your friendſhip, I expected advice and aſſiſtance; but now, Sir, I ſee that it is vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect happineſs from him, who has been ſo bad an oeconomiſt of his own; and that I muſt diſclaim his friendſhip, who ceaſes to be a friend to himſelf.</p>

as well acquainted with perſons of faſhion, as with modeſty; with Lords of the Treaſury, as with truth; and with all, as you are with Sir William Honeywood. I am Sir William Honeywood.</p>

               <p>I wiſh we could both ſay ſo: however, this gentleman, Sir William Honeywood, has been beforehand with you, in obtaining their pardon. So, if the two poor fools have a mind to marry, I think, we can tack them together without croſſing the Tweed for it.</p>

               <p>Excuſe me, Sir, if I interrupt your thanks, as I have here an intereſt that calls me. <stage>(Turning to Honeywood.)</stage> Yes, Sir, you are ſurpriſed to ſee me; and I own that a deſire of correcting your follies led me hither. I ſaw, with indignation, the errors of a mind that only ſought applauſe from others; that eaſineſs of diſpoſition, which, tho' inclin'd to the right, had not courage to condemn the wrong. I ſaw with regret thoſe ſplendid errors, that ſtill took name from ſome neighbouring duty. Your charity, that was but injuſtice; your benevolence, that was but weakneſs; and your friendſhip but credulity. I ſaw, with regret, great talents and extenſive learning, only employed to add ſprightlineſs to error, and encreaſe your perplexities. I ſaw your mind with a thouſand natural charms: but the greatneſs of its beauty ſerved only to heighten my pity for its proſtitution.</p>

               <p>Ceaſe to upbraid me, Sir; I have for ſome time but too ſtrongly felt the juſtice of your repoaches. But there is one way ſtill left me. Yes, Sir, I have determined, this very hour, to quit for ever a place where I have made myſelf the voluntary ſlave of all; and to ſeek among ſtrangers that fortitude which may give ſtrength to the mind, and marſhal all its diffipated virtues. Yet, ere I depart, permit me to ſolicit fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for this gentleman; who, notwithſtanding what has happened, has laid me under the moſt ſignal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.

               <p>Mr. Honeywood, I'm reſolv'd upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as well as you. I now begin to find, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1241002300:80"/>
the man who firſt invented the art of ſpeaking truth was a much cunninger fellow than I thought him. And to prove that I deſign to ſpeak truth for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I muſt now aſſure you, that you owe your late enlargement to another; as, upon my ſoul, I had no hand in the matter. So now, if any of the company has a mind for preferment, he may take my place. I'm determined to reſign.</p>

            <l>AS puffing quacks ſome caitiff wretch procure</l>
            <l>To ſwear the pill, or drop, has wrought a cure;</l>
            <l>Thus on the ſtage, our play-wrights ſtill depend</l>

            <l>Who knows each art of coaxing up the town,</l>
            <l>And make full many a bitter pill go down.</l>
            <l>Conſcious of this, our bard has gone about,</l>
            <l>And teaz'd each rhyming friend to help him out.</l>

            <l>Gives him good words indeed, but no aſſiſtance.</l>
            <l>As ſome unhappy wight, at ſome new play,</l>
            <l>At the Pit door ſtands elbowing away,</l>
            <l>While oft, with many a ſmile, and many a ſhrug,</l>
            <l>He eyes the centre, where his friends ſit ſnug,</l>
            <l>His ſimpering friends, with pleaſure in their eyes,</l>
            <l>Sink as he ſinks, and as he riſes riſe:</l>
            <l>He nods, they nod; he cringes, they grimace;</l>
            <l>But not a ſoul will budge to give him place.</l>
            <l>Since then, unhelp'd, our bard muſt now conform</l>

            <l>Blame where you muſt, be candid where you can,</l>
