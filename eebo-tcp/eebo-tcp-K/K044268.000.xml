            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS.</head>
            <p>I OFFER the following Comedy to the public, under a circumſtance which has given my mind the moſt exquiſite uneaſineſs. On the morning after the firſt repreſentation, it was obſerved by the papers that there had been perſons preſent at the Theatre the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evening, who went there <hi>determined</hi> to diſapprove at all events. From ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination it is hard indeed to eſcape! And the oppoſition intended, was juſtified it ſeems, by the indecency of ſome of the expreſſions. —From ſuch a charge I feel it impoſſible to defend myſelf; for againſt an imputation like this, even <hi>vindication</hi> becomes diſgraceful!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0439701000:3"/>As I was not at the Theatre, I ſhould have had ſome difficulty in underſtanding at what paſſages the objections were levelled, had not one of the papers recorded them, with many cruel remarks. The particulars which were thus pointed out, will, I truſt, be a ſufficient apology for themſelves. In the following pages they are <hi>all</hi> reſtored; that the public AT LARGE may have the power to adjudge me, as well as that ſmall part of it, confined within the walls of a Theatre.</p>
            <p>Theſe paſſages have not been reſtored from any pertinacious opinion of their beauty— for other expreſſions might have conveyed my intention as well; but had I allowed one line to ſtand as altered for the ſtage, what might not that reprobated line have been ſuppoſed to expreſs? I ſhrink from the idea! And therefore moſt ſolemnly aver, that the Comedy, as now printed, contains EVERY WORD which was oppoſed the firſt night, from the ſuſpicion of indelicacy; hoping their <hi>obvious</hi> meaning only will be attended to, without the coarſe ingenuity of ſtrained explanations; which
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0439701000:4"/>
have been made, by perſons who ſeem deſirous to ſurround my taſk of dramatic writing, with as many difficulties as poſſible.</p>
            <p>A celebrated Critic, more attended to for the diſcrimination and learning which appear in his ſtrictures, than for their <hi>lenity</hi>; in his obſervations on the Greybeards, has the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When Mrs. Cowley gets poſſeſſion of the ſpirit and turn of a character, ſhe ſpeaks the language of <hi>that</hi> character better than <hi>any</hi> of her dramatic cotemporaries.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, I confeſs, I hold to be very high praiſe; and it is to this very praiſe, which my cotemporaries reſolve I ſhall have no claim. They will allow me, indeed, to draw ſtrong character, but it muſt be without ſpeaking its language. I may give vulgar o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> low bred perſons, but they muſt converſe in a ſtile of elegance. I may deſign the coarieſt manners, or the moſt diſguſting folly, but its expreſſions muſt not deviate from the line of
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0439701000:5"/>
politeneſs. Surely it would be as juſt to exact from the Artiſts who are painting the Gallery of Shakeſpeare, that they ſhould compleat their deſigns without the uſe of light and ſhade.</p>
            <p>It cannot be the <hi>Poet</hi>'s mind, which the public deſire to trace, in dramatic repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the mind of the <hi>characters,</hi> and the truth of their colouring. Yet in my caſe it ſeems reſolved that the point to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is not whether that <hi>dotard,</hi> or that <hi>pretender,</hi> or that <hi>coquet,</hi> would ſo have given their feelings, but whether Mrs. <hi>Cowley</hi> ought ſo to have expreſſed herſelf.</p>
            <p>This is a criterion which happily no author is ſubjected to, but thoſe of the drama. The Noveliſt may uſe the boldeſt tints;— ſeizing Nature for her guide, ſhe may dart through every rank of ſociety, drag forth not only the accompliſhed, but the ignorant, the coarſe, and the vulgar-rich; diſplay them in their ſtrongeſt colours, and ſnatch immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality both for them, and for herſelf! I, on
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0439701000:6"/>
the contrary, feel encompaſſed with chains when I write, which check me in my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt flights, and force me continually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, not, whether <hi>this is juſt?</hi> but, whether <hi>this is ſafe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are vain regrets, which I hope my readers will pardon me, for having a moment indulged. I now haſten to that part of the Comedy which will be found in the following ſheets, as <hi>altered</hi> for the ſecond repreſentation.</p>
            <p>The idea of the buſineſs which concerns Antonia, Henry, and Gaſper was preſented to me in an obſolete Comedy; the work of a poet of the drama, once highly celebrated. I ſay the <hi>idea,</hi> for when it is known that in the original the ſcene lay amongſt traders in the city of London—and thoſe traders of the loweſt and moſt deteſtable manners, it will be conceived at once, that in removing it to Portugal, and fixing the characters amongſt the nobility, it was hardly poſſible to carry with me <hi>more</hi> than the idea. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which moſt particularly intereſted me,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0439701000:7"/>
and fixed itſelf in my mind, was that of ſnatching a young woman from a hateful marriage, the moment before that marrige became valid—that is to ſay, after the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. This very circumſtance to which the Comedy owes its exiſtence, was that, which ſome of the audience found diſcordant to their feelings. An event which had in the laſt century been ſtampt with the higheſt applauſe, (tho' ſurrounded by many repulſive circumſtances) was found in this, to be ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived. I did not, however, diſpute the deciſion of my Critics,—and the marriage has been in courſe diſſolved.</p>
            <p>The manner in which the Comedy has ſince been received, gives room to ſuppoſe that the alteration is approved. It has ſtruggled with many oppreſſive circumſtances: the chaſm in the performance, occaſioned by the repeated illneſs of Mr. Parſons, was ſufficient to have ſunk it;—but neither that, nor the ſterile month of December, always <hi>againſt</hi> the Theatres, has prevented its being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by many brilliant and crouded
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0439701000:8"/>
nights. I now reſign it to the cloſet, where without the aid of fine acting, or the faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of beauty, and deriving all its little force from the pen which compoſed it, it hopes ſtill to amuſe;—the innocent flame of Seraphina's coquetry may ſtill ſhed rays of delight on her readers, and the affecting ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Antonia intereſt them.</p>

                  <p>You muſt give me reaſons for this requeſt; for I am not certain that I ought not inſtantly to betray you.

                  <p>Think me not a ſeducer! I have lov'd Antonia for her purity and virtue; and to deſtroy <hi>her</hi> honour, would be to trample on my own. Oh Clara! few have lov'd as I do. My paſſion is mingled with the tender protecting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a brother; and violation is impoſſible!</p>

                  <speaker>Don Henry.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſhall know all;—and ſhould Antonia's marriage be voluntary, I will take no revenge but to leave her;—but if, as her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly allows me to hope, ſhe has been deceiv'd into it, there's not a power on earth that can divide us.</p>

                  <p>If your deſign is not contrary to rectitude, be aſſured I ſhall not oppoſe it. Follow me to a more diſtant room—a new ſecret is almoſt as delightful as a new lover.

I proteſt, a man thirty years younger could hardly have found ſuch a variety of things to have ſaid on ſo trivial a ſubject. One might miſtake you for an Engliſh ſenator, inſtead of a Portugueze privy counſellor, you can ſay ſo much upon nothing.</p>

                  <hi>My</hi> honour! Rely on that, and I ſwear to you by every thing ſacred, that no veſtal's life ſhall be more blameleſs. It is due to my own feelings to be chaſte—I don't condeſcend to think of yours in the affair. The reſpect I bear myſelf, makes me neceſſarily preſerve my purity—but if I am ſuſpected, watch'd, and haunted, I know not but ſuch torment may weary me out of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which I have hitherto cheriſh'd as my life.</p>

               <p>Mercy! who can it be, but old, ſhrivell'd, grey-pated Time? To <hi>his</hi> negative I ſhall yield— but with a very ill will, I aſſure you. If the paſſion we have for admiration is wrong, let nature look to it—'twas ſhe impreſs'd it on our hearts;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0439701000:31"/>
and it is <hi>her</hi> law, that to tyrannize over the peace of man, is to woman conſummation of happineſs!</p>

Welcome, Don Octavio! for I am inform'd that here you <hi>muſt</hi> have wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The man I ſaw at church, I proteſt.</p>

               <p>That cruel <hi>muſt,</hi> checks the tranſport your welcome gave me! May I not hope that <hi>without</hi> a muſt, you would have given me wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Seraph.</speaker>
               <p>Oh yes! pray hope it; for as I think the ſeaſon of <hi>hoping,</hi> the moſt delightful in our lives, I ſhould be ſorry to ſhorten yours.</p>

               <p>If you mean to ſhorten my hope by diſappointment, 'tis kind to protract it; but there is a way of ending hope, enchanting Viola! with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving deſpair.</p>

               <speaker>Seraph.</speaker>

               <p>So pretty an oath deſerves a civil reply, and I therefore proteſt to you, the moment Don Alexis conſents to my being yours, I'll yield you my hand without reluctance. But after this frank engagement, Don Octavio, I expect you to leave me for the preſent—I have a peculiar reaſon to requeſt this favour. Some one will come in a moment, and ſpoil my roguery.

Now minx, I feel that I have the truth; and I feel a violent deſire to make you feel this cane. And ſo that curious ſtranger muſt have been Don Sebaſtian, whom I have order'd her never to think of— never—never!—</p>

                  <p>Pho, I'll manage that. It would be hard, indeed, to marry an old man, and not make him do as one likes. Young huſbands we are content to ſubmit to, but when we marry GREY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEARDS, it is with the pious deſign to have our way in every thing.

Yes;—I am on this ſpot an old offender; and have ſo often gratefully experienced the candour of my judges, that I truſt now to meet their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don — and invoke the gracious ſign!</p>

            <l>A Mourning Bride!—that wou'd be ſomething new—</l>
            <l>(That I'm a Mourning Huſband is too true,</l>
            <l>Cries old Sir Teſty in his gouty chair,)</l>
            <l>"Ah could I wedlock's fatal ſlip repair!</l>
            <l>"But young wives are a ſort of flying gout,</l>
            <l>"Torments for which no cure was e'er found out;</l>
            <l>"Both old men's plagues, to puniſh youthful tricks,</l>
            <l>"Equally difficult, I fear, to fix.</l>
            <l>"Of wife and gout alike I ſtand in dread,</l>
            <l>"For both, alas! ſometimes affect the head."</l>
            <l>Thus rail old cynics, ſtriving to diſparage</l>
            <l>The charming ſilken ties of modern marriage.</l>
            <l>In former times, when folks agreed to wed,</l>
            <l>The ſilent bride by ſilent bridegroom led,</l>
            <l>Up to the altar march'd in ſolemn ſtate,</l>
            <l>All was demure, and ſtupidly ſedate.</l>
            <l>Impreſs'd with awe, while neither dar'd to ſpeak,</l>
            <l>A wedding was a mere Ballet Tragique.</l>
            <l>Thank Heav'n we're paſt the ages of romance;</l>
            <l>Wedlock is now a kind of country dance,</l>
            <l>Where man and wife with ſmiles each other greet,</l>
            <l>Take hands, change ſides, and part as ſoon as meet;</l>
            <l>Pleaſure's ſoft accents ev'ry care diſpel,</l>
            <l>While Hymen fiddles Vive la Bagatelle.</l>
            <l>Bleſt age! when ceremony's chains are worn,</l>
            <l>Like bracelets, not to ſetter, but adorn.</l>
            <l>When we aſſume deep mourning's fable ſhew,</l>
            <l>'Tis etiquette preſcribes the form of woe:</l>
            <l>Whate'er our loſs, we muſt have faſhion's leave,</l>
            <l>Ere we can venture decently to grieve.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:0439701000:87"/>Blameleſs the heir o'er the dear parchment chuckles,</l>
            <l>If he's unpowder'd, and puts on black buckles,</l>
            <l>Till the grey frock ſpeaks his firſt anguiſh o'er,</l>
            <l>And he's but half as wretched as before.</l>
            <l>Ere the gay widow firſt abroad is ſeen,</l>
            <l>Deck'd in exhilarating bombazeen,</l>
            <l>While the dear Col'nel viſits unſuſpected,</l>
            <l>And ſhe's as well as could have been expected;</l>
            <l>Cuſtom's indulgence wiſely does ſhe borrow,</l>
            <l>In cards of compliments exhauſts her ſorrow;</l>
            <l>Of tears her black-edg'd paper fills the place,</l>
            <l>Mourns as her proxy, and preſerves her face.</l>
            <l>Our Mourning Bride, who with no ſorrow labours,</l>
            <l>And mourns but in <hi>appearance,</hi> like her neighbours,</l>
            <l>Tho' forc'd by etiquette, good humour loves, as well as any here,</l>
            <l>Bleſt in the fate which theſe kind ſmiles decree her,</l>
            <l>She hopes her friends will often come to ſee her.</l>
