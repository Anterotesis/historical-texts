            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>I beg your Pardon, Doctor, there is no beſt in the Caſe; the beſt of the bad, is not worth chooſing; but if you have no more Skill in Medicines, than I have in Filles de Joye, I would not give a Fig for your Practice. Talking of the Fair, puts me in Mind of poor Miſs <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>; never was ſo good a Heart ſo much depreſs'd: With blooming Beauty, and a Soul angelic, ſhe drags a Life of Woe, and keeps the Shield of Virtue on her Arm; while her Hand rejects with Scorn, the tempting Bribes of gay Debauchery.</p>

                     <p>Let me tell you, Doctor, that's a damn'd ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Surmiſe, and did I not think you ſpoke it more out of Raillery, than Sincerity, I ſhould for ever hold the moſt contemptible Opinion of you as a Man.</p>

Oh, the Jade! had it not been for the great Regard I had for the Father, ſhe ſhould have ſhifted for herſelf long ago.</p>

                     <p>What the World ſays in thoſe Caſes, ought never to be regarded; for ſuch Reports generally ariſe from the inventive Goffips of a Tea table; and there is a Species of Barbarity that reigns predominant in the Breaſts of the low-minded Vulgar.

                     <speaker>Bland.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, truly, for it is well known that Miſs <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was (ſcarce three Years ago) the Admiration and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of the Country for ten Miles round, and now, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt Drab that was wont to think herſelf honoured with a Court'ſy from her, will, with a provoking Sneer, tell her to ſhorten her Furbelows; and ſince they have found her whole Dependence is on you, they have injured her, by impoſing on you ſome malicious Falſehood, on the mere Suppoſition of which, I find you are determined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat her Miſery.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>Nay, Mr. <hi>Blandford,</hi> it is not for that entirely, but from the very great Expence ſhe has been to me of late, and as I find that hurts my Circumſtances conſiderably, it is a Duty I owe myſelf not to let her ruin me entirely. I have made her many good Offers; nay I made Intereſt for her to a Gentleman and Lady who were going to <hi>South Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina,</hi> where they told her ſhe would have the greateſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in the World of making her Fortune; all which ſhe ungratefully rejected; and as I am under no Manner of Obligation to her, or hers, I think I have done for her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready what hundreds would not have done; in Truth therefore ſhe muſt now ſhift for herſelf as well as ſhe can.</p>

                     <speaker>Bland.</speaker>
                     <p>Poor Girl! I can't blame her; 'tis ſtrange ſo great a Tenderneſs Mr. <hi>Danbury</hi> had for her when living, that he did not make ſome Proviſion for her at his Death.</p>

                     <speaker>Pitt.</speaker>
                     <p>That's the Aſtoniſhment of every one, but what could a Man do that had it not in his Power?</p>

                     <p>Ah, <hi>Ned,</hi> you ſee with what Art ſome People can ſupport a falſe Reputatian, and when their Affairs come once to be laid open to Inſpection, many a worthy Family that has truſted their All in their Hands, from too good an Opinion of their Circumſtances, find too often a broken Back in the Conſequence.</p>

                  <p>True, Sir, very true; I've been obliged to lend him Money, at different Times, to the Amount of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, though it went very much againſt me to do it, had he not been a pretty near Relation, I wou'd not have done it on any Account. But he has certainly a deal of good Nature; and I know too that he'll pay when he has it, for I lent him a hundred and twenty Pounds before, and I muſt ſay he pay'd me very honeſtly again, with good Intereſt into the Bargain. But if I could get him to pay the good two hundred Pounds he owes me now, I ſhould hardly riſk any more with him, I think.</p>

               <l>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0072600300:89"/>And ſtruck the reſt with great Surprize,</l>
               <l>To ſee him claim her for his Prize,</l>
               <l>He firſt bereav'd her of her Crown,</l>
               <l>And claim'd the Maiden all his own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now ev'ry Youngſter on the Plain</l>
               <l>Look'd with Envy on the Swain,</l>
               <l>But all in Juſtice did declare</l>
               <l>He won the Maid;—the Trick was fair.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The 'Squire pauz'd, and ſhook his Head,</l>
               <l>His hearty ſmile of Humour fled</l>
               <l>To ſee his Child another's Claim,</l>
               <l>And now he 'gan himſelf to blame.</l>
               <l>The Swain beheld the good Man's Eyes,</l>
               <l>With Tears he offer'd back his Prize.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The 'Squire charm'd at ſuch a Deed</l>
               <l>Cry'd you deſerve her now indeed!</l>
               <l>It glads me much, young Swain to find,</l>
               <l>Thou bear'ſt ſo great, ſo good a Mind;</l>
               <l>Here take her Lad,—I murmur not</l>
               <l>If ſhe's contented with her Lot,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She ſmil'd Conſent, and chear'd the drooping Swain,</l>
               <l>She gave her Hand, her Meaning to explain.</l>
               <l>The 'Squire ſaw, and bleſs'd the blooming Pair,</l>
               <l>And three loud Vollies broke the peaceful Air.</l>

            <head>CHRISTMAS EVE IN THE COUNTRY.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>THE Mountain tops were tipt with driven Snow,</l>
               <l>And Silver white were all the Vales below,</l>
               <l>When, ceaſing thro' the frozen Field to roam,</l>
               <l>Each Country Bumpkin ambles to his Home;</l>
               <l>Enjoys what oft his betters do admire</l>
               <l>In Winter Time,—a comfortable Fire,</l>
               <l>There with his Spouſe and roſy Brats regale</l>
               <l>In ſimple Mirth all round a Mug of Ale.</l>
               <l>And now when ſome ſage venerable 'Squire</l>
               <l>Does from the Noiſe of this great Town retire,</l>
               <l>To end his Days, forgetting King and Court,</l>
               <l>And turns once more unto his youthful Sport;</l>
               <l>But feels the Want of Strength, the Want of Sight,</l>
               <l>And feels the Winter more ſeverely bite,</l>
               <l>Than when his Blood, ſome forty Years ago</l>
               <l>Wou'd reek with Ardour in <hi>December</hi>'s Snow;</l>
               <l>Climb the ſteep Hill, the flowing Riv'let fly,</l>
               <l>And join with Speed the chearful Huntſman's Cry</l>
               <l>'Till the deep Vally eccho'd to the Sky.</l>
               <l>Leſs Exerciſe poor Man will now content,</l>
               <l>Infirmity will teach him to repent;</l>

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0072600300:91"/>And make Attonement for a Life of Sin,—</l>
               <l>At threeſcore Years 'tis Time ſure to begin.</l>
               <l>The Night approach'd, each Friend receives his Gueſt,</l>
               <l>To drink an Health, or crack ſome merry Jeſt</l>
               <l>To eat and drink in hearty free Good will,</l>
               <l>And all the Troubles of the Day to kill.</l>
               <l>Tho' Ven'ſon fumes ne'er taint their homely Board,</l>
               <l>The feaſt on what they better can afford;</l>
               <l>A good Sir Loin, a Pudding full of Plumbs,</l>
               <l>Smoaking and hot upon the Table comes.</l>
               <l>No Prince on Earth cou'd here refuſe to eat</l>
               <l>So nice the Pudding and ſo ſweet the Meat.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Once on a Time the Fire Side was grac'd</l>
               <l>With ſix true pair of Lovers round it plac'd,</l>
               <l>When biting Froſt, and Snow beſpread the Green,</l>
               <l>The Lads here ſerv'd their Laſſes for a Skreen,</l>
               <l>By holding them as we do often ſee</l>
               <l>The Lads in Town—their Laſſes on their Knee;</l>
               <l>Now each in Turn wou'd Sing a merry Song,</l>
               <l>And ſome wou'd tell a Story very long,</l>
               <l>While all attentive wou'd with Wonder hear,</l>
               <l>And ſhew'd with Eyes of Love an Heart of Fear;</l>
               <l>One who refuſed in his Turn to ſing,</l>
               <l>Told a ſad Story of a murder'd King.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Another cry'd, he heard his Granny ſay</l>
               <l>As ſhe was paſſing thro' a lonely way,</l>
               <l>The Night was dark and Glow-worms did appear,</l>
               <l>When ev'ry Tree then added to her Fear.</l>
               <l>And paſſing by a lonely Church Yard Wall</l>
               <l>The Grave Stones mov'd, the Steeple ſhook and all.</l>

               <l>Another now began a woeful Tale</l>
               <l>The very Thought of which oft turn'd him pale.—</l>
               <l>Once, ſaid he, a Lady fair and tall</l>
               <l>Did walk a Nights upon our Garden Wall;</l>
               <l>She ſometimes like a Sow and Pigs appear'd</l>
               <l>And ſometimes like a Jew, with a long Beard,</l>
               <l>And ſometimes like a greyhound, ſleek and trim,</l>
               <l>Sometimes like a Lion very Grim.</l>
               <l>And once my Father ſaid he ſaw it ſtand</l>
               <l>With a bleeding Heart graſp't within its Hand</l>
               <l>And once he heard it like a Raven croak,</l>
               <l>And thrice, they ſay, it to our Parſon ſpoke.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At this ſad Tale, not one in all the Houſe,</l>
               <l>But even fear'd the moving of a Mouſe.</l>
               <l>O lack a-Day, cry'd one fair trembling Maid,</l>
               <l>I fear to move, I am ſo much afraid.</l>
               <l>Another, liſt'ning, thought ſhe heard a Voice,</l>
               <l>Another cry'd, I'm ſure I heard a Noiſe.</l>
               <l>Huſh was the Word, while each with liſt'ning Fear,</l>
               <l>Did, as it were, all ſtatue-ſtruck appear.</l>
               <l>Nor Eye, nor Finger now was ſeen to move,</l>
               <l>But each pale Maid cling'd faſt about her Love;</l>
               <l>And all, the more from Fear, than from Deſire,</l>
               <l>Mov'd by Degrees almoſt into the Fire.</l>
               <l>A dreadful Clatter all at once was heard,</l>
               <l>And in a Trice the Fire Side was clear'd;</l>
               <l>Out at the Door they helter-ſkelter ran,</l>
               <l>Nor 'till the Morning did there one return;</l>
               <l>The Parſon and the Clerk at Noon were brought,</l>
               <l>With Faces full of Fear and Heads of Thought;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0072600300:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>Gravely they enter'd, with a ſolemn Look,</l>
               <l>The Parſon held his Breech, the Clerk his Book,</l>
               <l>And ſtep by ſtep with Caution ſtar'd around,</l>
               <l>Thinking moſt ſure 'twas all inchanted Ground.</l>
               <l>But firſt they both into the Oven peept,</l>
               <l>Thinking, perhaps, it might in there have crept,</l>
               <l>But turning to the Cup-board, there did lie,</l>
               <l>A nice Plumb-pudding, and a Chriſtmas Pie,</l>
               <l>That Puſs had in her thieving Tricks thrown down,</l>
               <l>And ſtruck with Wonder all the ſimple Town.</l>
               <l>The Parſon, with a knaviſh Leer and Grin,</l>
               <l>Stroak'd with great Sanctity his double Chin.</l>
               <l>Cry'd 'twas a Shame ſuch Pudding ſhould be loſt,</l>
               <l>And in an Inſtant down his Throat he toſt</l>
               <l>A Piece that wou'd almoſt have choak'd a Hog,</l>
               <l>And gave old Sly the Clerk a frienldy Jog.</l>
               <l>Who likewiſe cry'd, indeed it was a Shame,</l>
               <l>And by the Prieſt's Example did the ſame.</l>
               <l>Then both turn'd home with Safety and Content,</l>
               <l>And left the Loſers only to repent;</l>
               <l>Telling 'em of the worſt to make the moſt,</l>
               <l>To reſt content, by giving up the Ghoſt.</l>
