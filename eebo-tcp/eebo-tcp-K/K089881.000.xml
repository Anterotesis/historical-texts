            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OF THE NOTTINGTON WATER.</head>
            <p>NOTTINGTON is a ſmall Hamlet, between five and ſix miles from Dorcheſter; about the diſtance of two miles from Weymouth; nearly a furlong weſtward of the turnpike road, between theſe two towns.</p>
            <p>The mineral ſpring of this place has long been in great repute, for the cure of various diſeaſes, both by its external, and internal uſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing which generally attracts the notice of thoſe who examine this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0006700700:5"/>is the briſk ſmell of ſulphur it copiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly emits, plainly evincing a ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation of that mineral.</p>
            <p>In attempting to deſcribe the flavour of any particular mineral water, words are never ſufficiently expreſſive of it, ſo as to come up to its genuine taſte.</p>
            <p>This Spring in the opinion of many, reſembles very much to the palate, a weak ſolution of ſal polychreſt; it has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a boiled egg by ſome, ſomewhat ſtale, and by others to rotten eggs.</p>
            <p>It is but juſtice however to ſay of the Nottington Water, that it is by no means ſo diſguſting as ſulphureous waters in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral prove, and appears to be much leſs ſo to many people, than thoſe of Harrogate, and Cheltenham.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0006700700:6"/>
            <p>With reſpect to its ſpecific gravity, when compared with that of diſtilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by means of the hydroſtatical balance, the difference between them is ſo trifling, as not to be an object of any conſideration on that account, the latter is rather the lighter of the two.</p>
            <p>In colour it has a milky, ſlight blue tinge, which appears to be conſiderably heightened by viewing the Water in a tin veſſel.</p>
            <p>That there is an acidity in this water is not to be doubted in the leaſt, from its property of turning white on being mixed with alkalis, and from its curdling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with ſoap.</p>
            <p>This acid is moſt undoubtedly inherent in its ſulphur, and affords a perfect conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0006700700:7"/>of the opinion, which that learned Phyſician Dr. Stahll, moſt erroneouſly maintained, viz. <hi>"That Acids do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſt in Sulphur, but are merely Creatures of the Fire."</hi> An aſſertion eaſily diſproved in later times, by all who are become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the component parts of this mineral, by the progreſſive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements made in chemiſtry.</p>
            <p>That the Nottington Water abounds with an alkali, manifeſtly appears, from an analyſis of its component parts, by the uſual proceſs of evaporation—The ſalt which is afterwards extracted from the inſoluble reſiduum, on being well rubbed into raw meat, occaſions it to turn very red, in conformity to the well known property of alkaline nitre.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0006700700:8"/>
            <p>That it has no chalybeate or ſerrugin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impregnation is moſt readily inferred, from a tincture of galls or ſuch other aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent having no further effect in changing the appearance of the Water than giving a ſlight tinge of an amber caſt, ſcarcely deeper than ſtraw colour.—And it does not appear that it borrows any impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the pyrites which uſually gives the ſprings in the neighbourhood where it abounds their ferruginous and chalybeate qualities.—The ſtones in the vicinity of the well apparently reſemble common ſtones, and the neighbouring ſprings do not differ at all from common ſimple water.</p>
            <p>That it contains no oker is preſumed on the firſt inſpection of the water, ſuch
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0006700700:9"/>mineral ſprings as evidently contain oker have a yellow matter reſembling a ſort of thin cream floating on their ſurface, and the ſtones at the bottom and ſides of ſuch ſprings, are moſt commonly tinged very much with the ſame—nothing of which is diſcoverable here, or in any ſpring in the neighbourhood of the well.</p>
            <p>That the ſalt contained in the Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Water is not of ſufficient ſtrength to reſtrain the volatility of the ſulphur, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the effluvia before mentioned, which it ſo readily and plentifully gives off.</p>
            <p>In evaporating the water, this ſulphur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous ſmell is entirely removed by the time half the water is exhaled in the operation,</p>
            <p>The proceſs of evaporating four quarts of the water to dryneſs in the common
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0006700700:10"/>way, leaves about two ſcruples or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more of a brown reddiſh maſs.</p>
            <p>If however a glaſs retort is made uſe of, and the water is drawn off by a very gentle ſand heat with great circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, almoſt a third more, may be gained from the ſame quantity of the water.</p>
            <p>The ſalt which is afterwards extracted from the inſoluble reſiduum, is in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ten grains to two, of the latter.</p>
            <p>This ſalt when mixed with ſpirit of vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol, cauſes a very conſiderable ebullition; affording thereby eſſential evidence of its alkaline quality, in addition to what has already been obſerved.</p>
            <p>When this ſalt is rubbed with ſal am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, it has an urinous pungent ſmell, and when it is mixed with ſalt of tartar,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0006700700:11"/>it gives off rather an offenſive foetid odour.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerved that a very pretty experiment may be made with this water, after being kept a proper time, and this without the trouble of a regular chemical proceſs.</p>
            <p>By keeping the Nottington Water in bottles, for the ſpace of a twelvemonth, or more; it affords a ſpontaneous partial analyſis of itſelf, light bodies of different colours are obſerved floating on its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, theſe are the ſulphureous particles now all collected together, which were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally diffuſed throughout the ſubſtance of the whole.—Theſe ſlender corpuſcles if carefully taken up, and dried, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſtrewed on a red hot poker, or bar
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0006700700:12"/>of iron, flame and ſparkle beautifully, into an infinite variety of colours, reſembling a peacock's tail, very elegantly illuſtrating the formation of the variegated ſcum ſo frequently obſerved on the ſurface of many mineral waters, ſulphureous as well as chalybeate.</p>
            <p>A multiplicity of experiments have been made long ſince, on the Nottington Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with moſt of the various ſubſtances commonly made uſe of in inveſtigating the properties of mineral waters, thoſe which have been principally employed in this, were ſolutions of ſilver, lead, copperas, and alum, lime water, ſea water, ſoap, volatile alkalis mild and cauſtic, tincture and powder of galls, and ſuch other aſtringents, ſyrup of violets, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0006700700:13"/>
            <p>Theſe experiments have been made by different perſons at diſtinct periods of time, thoſe made by Godfry, were in the year 1719, thoſe by the late Dr. William Cuming, of Dorcheſter, in 1740, and thoſe by Dr. Rutty, nine years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>Repeated trials of a more recent date by others, as well as ſeveral very lately made by the writer of theſe ſheets, all tend indiſputably to confirm the opinion uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received, and proved by all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding experiments, than this water is principally impregnated with ſulphur and the native alkaline ſalt or natron with which almoſt all the mineral waters in France ſo plentifully abound; and which many affirm to be the true nitre of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0006700700:14"/>antients.—This natron ſome are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bears a nearer affinity to ſal ammoniac than to ſaltpetre — Dr. Leigh, calls it a ſea, and urinous ſalt — The natron (or anatron) which is taken out of a lake of ſtagnant water in the deſart of Nitria in Aegypt, is deſcribed by Pliny, as an alkaline ſalt of a lixiviate taſte and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated like a ſponge.</p>
            <p>In deſcribing any mineral water it may be perhaps expected by ſome, that a very minute and ſatisfactory enquiry, into its contents and natural appearances ſhou'd not only be made; but its inherent virtues alſo be fully explained, by any writer who engages in a taſk of this kind.</p>
            <p>But ſuch readers wou'd do well to bear in mind that this intricate ſubject
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0006700700:15"/>when every thing is duly conſidered, muſt ever neceſſarily remain involved in much doubt, and obſcurity; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that the learning of Short, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy of Shaw, the ſagacity of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Boyle, the ingenuity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Hoffman, and the ſubſequent labours of other ingenious men of later days, have altogether contributed much leſs than cou'd be wiſhed to remove the veil thrown over theſe arcana of nature.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, but that the greater part of mineral waters moſt aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly contain certain inherent principles, from which their virtues derive their ſource reſpectively, which are not to be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by any experiments whatever; they are placed infinitely too far beyond our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0006700700:16"/>reach, the imperfection of human nature utterly precluding us from the power of conſidering them as the objects of ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Thus for inſtance, with reſpect to the inherent ſpecific properties of the Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington Water now under conſideration.</p>
            <p>Who is able to aſcertain poſitively to which particular quality of it, its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged healing virtue is indebted— Is it owing to its ſulphureous acid? to its alkaline ſalt? to a due combination of both, co-exiſting in this ſalutary ſpring? or perhaps after all, to ſome active princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the elementary water itſelf, not cognizable by the organs of our ſenſes, rather than to any of its diſtinct proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which can be rendered the immediate object of them by any chemical analyſis.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0006700700:17"/>
            <p>Almoſt every body very readily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and that with all due applauſe, that very great diſcoveries and uſeful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are continually making in analyſing mineral waters, that the means of doing it to greater advantage are much facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the labour, an ingenuity, of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern chymiſts, as well as of many curious naturaliſts—That enquiries of this nature, afford an almoſt inexhauſtible fund of rational entertainment to ſpeculative men fond of ſuch reſearches, who ſhou'd by no means be diſcouraged in following their favourite recreations at once ſo amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and inſtructing—But with regard to medical practitioners the caſe is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, to whom ſome bounds ought to be ſet to the time employed in ſuch lucubrations.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0006700700:18"/>
            <p>
               <hi>"Eſt modus in rebus ſunt certi denique Fines"</hi> it is their more immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to attend to the good effects of mineral waters, making ſuch uſe of their known properties, as may beſt tend to promote the art of healing diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The ſatisfaction ariſing from thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying their time, and talents, will prove the beſt conſolation for their ſelf-denial in foregoing reſearches, more curious, than uſeful, when carried too far by thoſe on whom the public have a powerful and juſt claim, for a larger portion of their time, than they otherwiſe leave it in their power to afford, to ſuch as ſtand in need of their conſtant daily attendance.</p>
            <p>It may therefore perhaps be deemed ſufficient for the purpoſe of this ſmall tract,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0006700700:19"/>which is written principally to recommend the known qualities of this Water, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat once for all, that the predominant minerals which impregnate the Nottington ſpring are ſulphur, and a native alkaline ſalt—That alkalis, and acids, co-exiſt in it in ſuch a manner as to form the peculiar combination: which contributes altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give this celebrated ſpring healing qualities, which (under due management) may be rendered of great benefit to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in various diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Dr. Rutty in his ſynopſis of mineral waters places this ſpring in the firſt claſs of nitro-ſulphureous waters, and as the virtue and ſingular utility of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations in medicine are acknowledged on all hands, it is earneſtly recommended
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0006700700:20"/>to phyſicians, by this learned writer, to ſearch their reſpective neighbourhoods in order to increaſe the catalogue of ſuch medicinal ſprings, as an object of much importance to the community.</p>
            <p>If at the ſame time it was generally better underſtood, that they were ready to take the pains of regiſtering the cures performed by the waters in their vicinity, ſuch communications would probably be made to them from time to time, by many who derive material benefit from their uſe, as would furniſh uſeful hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by which the virtues of mineral waters would be better aſcertained, their reputation conſequently advanced, and a more general uſe made of them for the good of all thoſe afflicted with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0006700700:21"/>the complaints, which experience has proved them an effectual remedy for.</p>
            <p>That this may in ſome meaſure be brought about with reſpect to the Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington Water, is the principal induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the writer has for intruding a ſecond time into the cloſet of the reader.</p>

            <head>OF THE VIRTUES OF THE NOTTINGTON WATER,</head>
            <p>THIS Water has long been deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly famous for its great efficacy in curing various diſeaſes, more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of the ſkin, which it radically effects, removing all eruptions and foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of it both by the internal and external uſe of the ſpring duely perſiſted in.</p>
            <p>It moſt admirably tempers ebullitions of the blood; it is cleanſing, cooling, and yet penetrating, few mineral waters perhaps equal it in attenuating groſs humours of the habit, by means of its
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0006700700:23"/>ſubtle, penetrating, ſulphureous, ſpirit it pervades the minuteſt veſſels.</p>
            <p>In impaired digeſtion with loſs of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite (whether from too free living or otherwiſe) attended with great debility, experience has proved it of ſingular uſe, in ſtrengthning the digeſtive powers of the ſtomach, and reſtoring the tone of its fibres.</p>
            <p>It helps to remove effectually obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of the liver, ſpleen, and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcera: it relieves grievous head achs, and has been remarkably uſeful in curing the excruciating pains of the cramp.</p>
            <p>Aſſiſted with ſuitable remedies adapted to the occaſion, it has been known to cure a moſt obſtinate jaundice of long ſtanding; and in ſlighter attacks of that complaint, its ſucceſs has been very frequent.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0006700700:24"/>
            <p>It entirely deſtroys the different ſpecies of worms which infeſt the human body, and with leſs trouble and inconvenience, than the uſe of many other anthelmintics occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the gravel this water is drank to very great advantage to the ſufferer. as it ſcarcely ever fails in promoting the diſcharge of ſand in conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, when it is perſevered in for ſome time; it clears the urinary paſſages, and has been ſerviceable in ſome caſes, which were looked upon as ulcerations of the kidnies from the attendant ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>In weakneſſes of the nervous ſyſtem, where the patient is low and quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited, this Water has the happieſt effects, eſpecially in ſome particular
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0006700700:25"/>habits of a ſcorbutic tendency, with dejection, loſs of ſtrength and appetite, not unfrequently accompanied with blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſpots, and other eruptive appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the ſkin.</p>
            <p>Uſed externally, and internally by perſons of corpulent habits, who become unweildy ſuddenly, the Nottington Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſerviceable in reducing them to a more ſalutary ſtandard, removing ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous laſſitude, and checking this inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tendency to a too rapid corpulency.</p>
            <p>In an incontinence of urine this Water will alleviate the complaint, and will probably be found to effect much more, when trials are made of it more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by thoſe who have the misfortune to be afflicted with this troubleſome, and hitherto incurable diſeaſe.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0006700700:26"/>
            <p>But in nothing, has the peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of this Water in correcting the vitiated juices of the body, been more manifeſtly ſeen; than in the healing of old wounds, which a ſcorbutic taint, or depraved humours of the habit, had occaſioned to break out afreſh, and in ulcers which from ſimilar cauſes, either were never fairly healed up, or if they were ſo pronounced, were exceedingly apt to break out again from time to time, on any great change of the conſtitution of the air; or in the diet of the perſon diſeaſed, from any violent fatigue under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, or from any exceſs unguardedly committed.</p>
            <p>A remarkable recent caſe of the kind under conſideration lately occurred, in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0006700700:27"/>which the ſuperior efficacy of the Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington Water, over many other mineral waters in the kingdom, was fairly proved by a reſpectable gentleman; in healing up a wound of long ſtanding, which had baffled every attempt made to effect a cure by the waters at ſeveral of the moſt eminent places of reſort; and which he had diſpaired of ever finding that relief for, which he has now happily obtained, by perſevering ſome time in the external and internal uſe of this healing ſpring, which has given him (as it were) a new conſtitution, and repaired the injuries his habit had ſuſtained by reſiding in hot climates.</p>
            <p>In ſome kinds of eryſipelas, drinking this Water has been recommended with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0006700700:28"/>ſucceſs, but the efficacy of the external application of it ſeems rather equivocal; and indeed in this diſeaſe ſew outward applications are admiſſible with ſafety—dry meal applied to the parts affected is perhaps one of the beſt, as well as the ſafeſt topies.</p>
            <p>In ſtrumous inflammations of the eyes, the uſe of this Water may be perſevered in both externally and internally, till a cure is effected, which it eventually brings about, in a ſhorter ſpace of time, than almoſt any other remedy, and with greater ſecurity againſt relapſes.</p>
            <p>It has been the cuſtom with the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this neighbourhood (for time immemorial) to drink this Water chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the month of march, before the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0006700700:29"/>ſpring rains fall, when they look upon the Water as poſſeſſing its greateſt degree of ſtrength. — But the company who frequent Weymouth in the ſeaſon for ſea bathing, from july to october incluſive, drink this Water in dry ſeaſons to great advantage,—For want of proper conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence this ſpring has not been made uſe of externally for a conſiderable time paſt ſo much as it is to be hoped it will be in future, when ſome propoſed improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that purpoſe have taken place.</p>
            <p>By bathing, the Water is taken into the habit by the abſorbent veſſels, and carried through the lymphatic ſyſtem, this would be ſtill more effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by making uſe of it warm.</p>
            <p>A warm bath of the Nottington Water,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0006700700:30"/>analogy leaves us little or no room to doubt, will be found at leaſt equal to that of Harrowgate in curing hard tumors, paralytic pains, ulcers, ſcrophulous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, bruiſes, ſtrains, lameneſs, and weakneſs. — In moſt colical complaints in general, in nephritic colics, and even in nervous hyſteric colics, (with proper management in other reſpects) it will be found a moſt uſeful remedy.</p>
            <p>It muſt not however be denied that there are certain particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, under which the indiſcriminate uſe of this Water would be prejudicial. — It is deemed improper for perſons under an hectic ſever, and is equally ſo for thoſe who have tubercles of their lungs, and ſome contingent circumſtances may
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0006700700:31"/>ariſe during a courſe of it, which may for a time render it neceſſary to deſiſt both from its external, and internal uſe, till ſuch obſtacles are removed; it is therefore proper in the uſe of this, as well as in other mineral waters, that it ſhould be <hi>"Arte data."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are however fewer exceptions to the general uſe of this ſpring, than to moſt other mineral waters, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently leſs danger to be incurred, from an indiſcriminate uſe of it by thoſe who are obliged to have recourſe to it without the benefit of advice.</p>
            <p>Some people to whom the uſe of the Nottington Water has been enjoined, have been recommended to take an eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and ſome mild purgative before they entered on a courſe of the Water.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0006700700:32"/>
            <p>Theſe ſteps may perhaps be neceſſary ſometimes, where there is a nauſea at the ſtomach, or where the particular ſtate of the bowels, may require their being previouſly cleanſed—and to ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous patients more particularly, ſuch evacuations are exceedingly uſeful pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to drinking and bathing.</p>
            <p>Otherwiſe in general, as this Water paſſes very readily off for the moſt part by the urinary paſſages, and keep the body moderately open; it is ſeldom very neceſſary, to make uſe of any previous evacuations,</p>
            <p>When indeed the natural diſcharges do not properly occur, as they ought; both purgatives and diuretic medicines ſhould be exhibited; by the uſe of which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0006700700:33"/>properly managed, the Water has ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after its uſual good effects.</p>
            <p>When the Water is detained at any time rather too long in the habit, nothing facilitates the operation of diuretics and contributes to keep off feveriſh heat from the ſyſtem, more than an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional uſe of the lancet.</p>
            <p>Moderate exerciſe is adviſeable dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a courſe of this Water, and riding ſeems the moſt eligible way of taking it.</p>
            <p>No very ſtrict diet is enjoined in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſes, ſalted meat however, fiſh and eggs, ſhould not be eaten.</p>
            <p>It is a circumſtance which never can be ſufficiently regretted, that hiſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of cures effected by the Nottington Water from time to time, have never
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0006700700:34"/>been authenticated, in a manner to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the attention of the public in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, or that of the afflicted in particular, labouring under complaints which it is ſo effectual a remedy for; no regiſter of cures performed, having been preſerved.</p>
            <p>Although the writer of theſe ſheets has had ample information, and ſome perſonal experience of the undoubted efficacy of this ſpring in various diſeaſes, ſo as to warrant his recommending the uſe of it in private practice, he is aware that to reſt the reputation of it on his bare aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be a moſt unbecoming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in him; it is with a view to procure a ſeries of well atteſted hiſtories of cures in future, that he undertakes an office, (he would be better pleaſed to ſee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0006700700:35"/>placed in abler hands) of digeſting the communications he may receive through a channel (judged to be as little excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable as poſſible) of cures effected from time to time, with ſuch obſervations on thoſe which fall under his own immediate inſpection, as may tend to promote this undertaking, which has for its object, the rendering of this mineral Water of more general uſe.</p>
            <p>Had a plan of this kind been adopted many years ago, the public would have been in poſſeſſion of ſuch a liſt of cures as would have removed every doubt of the wonderful efficacy of this healing ſpring, and it would not have been neceſſary at this time to have recalled the attention of the public to this medical ſpring by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0006700700:36"/>celebrating its due praiſes de novo.</p>
            <p>The Well has been of late in a very bad condition from neglect, and will continue leſs uſeful to the public, till proper ſteps are taken to put it in order.</p>
            <p>The moſt obvious method to put an effectual ſtop to the uncleanly abuſes ſo long and juſtly complained of, will be to have it properly covered in, and a pump erected; that thoſe who drink the Water, may have it in the utmoſt purity.</p>
            <p>A ſtone ciſtern ſunk at a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to receive the waſte water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by a trough, will ſerve as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſervoir, for the purpoſe of waſhing diſeaſed animals.—The abhorred idea of their being dipped in the Well, has deterred many people from uſing the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0006700700:37"/>Water, and common decency requires, that ſuch loathſome objects ſhould be kept from the ſight of thoſe, who repair to the Well, to drink the Water.</p>
            <p>The expedient at preſent made uſe of, to purify the ſpring after theſe pollutions, by an opening made in the ſide of the well, level with the ſurface of the ground; to clear it of the foul water, is attended with a particular inconvenience.—The adjoining rivulet, not unfrequently flows freely through the opening into the well, which neceſſarily lowers the ſtrength of the mineral water, and conſequently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes its medicinal virtues, more or leſs, in proportion as the flood prevails.</p>
            <p>The approach to the ſpring is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent extremely inconvenient, it affords
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0006700700:38"/>no ſhelter in bad weather to thoſe who frequent it, and many other awkward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attend its preſent ſtate, which all who have occaſion to viſit it complain of, and wiſh to ſee remedied.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the writer of this tract, had it in contemplation to ſubmit to the public a plan to render the ſpring of more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe, by propoſing the moſt obvious means to remove the obſtacles to this deſireable end.—He did himſelf the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to communicate his deſign to ſome gentlemen of fortune, whoſe property near the ſpring gave them a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand this attention from him.—Two of theſe gentlemen were mutually diſpoſed to remedy the defects complained of, at their own private expence; which rendered
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0006700700:39"/>any application to the public from the writer on the plan he had propoſed, not only unneceſſary, but under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances improper.</p>
            <p>The lord of the hundred alſo did him the honour to ſignify by letter, his aſſent to any improvements to be made at the Well by which the public were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited; it not only was a mark of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to theſe gentlemen, to lay before them the intended repairs neceſſary to be made to preſerve the Water, but there were local circumſtances with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the right of its property, which rendered it incumbent on him to act with becoming attention to each of the gentlemen, without preſuming to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the validity of either of their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0006700700:40"/>claims, the diſcuſſion of which by no means belonged to him to enter into.</p>
            <p>If the writer's plan of fitting up the Well by public contribution had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable, it was recommended to have a pump room erected of a circular form; the pump to have been in the center, with a circular ſtone ſeat round the inſide wall, to have had a proper ciſtern with a trough or channel to convey the waſte water to a reſervoir at a convenient diſtance for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal uſe—It was intended to ſupply the pump room with glaſſes, for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe who drink the Water, and a key, or keys, were to be lodged at one of the adjacent houſes, to be delivered from time to time, to all who called for them for acceſs to the pump, and ſome other
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0006700700:41"/>conveniencies were intended for the better accommodation of the public.</p>
            <p>All perſons who derive any material benefit by the uſe of the Nottington Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are requeſted earneſtly to leave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their reſpective caſes in the hands of Mr. Delamotte, at his Library in St. Thomas's Street, Weymouth; who is to collect the hiſtories of cures perſormed by it—By theſe communications, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity will be afforded of aſcertaining the virtues of the water more fully than has been done hitherto; of extending its reputation, and bringing it into more general uſe; which it is preſumed will eventually be found equal to the waters of Harrowgate or Cheltenham, in the cure of various maladies, more particularly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0006700700:42"/>ſcorbutic, ſcrophulous, and cutancous diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Since theſe ſheets went to the preſs, the Well has been properly cleanſed, a ſtone wall has been built round it, and by the ſame benevolent hand, if the writer is not miſinformed, it is further intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to convey the water by a trough to a ciſtern for external uſe.—Though the plan on which this has been conducted, falls rather ſhort, of what it is hoped will be hereafter effected; it ſtill redounds much to the credit of this diſintereſted benefactor to the public, who does not aim at eſtabliſhing any claim whatever to the property of the well, by what he has already done, or means further to do; his ſole motive being to render this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0006700700:43"/>mineral Water of more general uſe, by removing the nuiſances complained of; that all who drink it, may partake of it in its pureſt ſtate.</p>
            <p>By theſe means this Well fallen in ſome meaſure of late into diſuſe, but never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the leaſt diſcredit as to its medicinal virtues, will flouriſh with renewed and augmented ſplendor, and prove hereafter uſeful to thouſands yet unborn; by the divine help, without which the virtues of mineral ſprings are of no avail.</p>
