            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>I HAVE ventured to criticize the Works of a very celebrated Writer, who took it into his Head to oppoſe the ſolid Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>falſe Philoſophy.</hi> As His, at beſt, is but the Cauſe of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Eloquence,</hi> all the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port he could give it was only to tell us <hi>how</hi> PLATO <hi>wrote:</hi> Mine being that of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>realizing</hi> all I ſay, in bidding the World take Notice <hi>how</hi> YOU <hi>live.</hi>

               <p>IT hath been the Fate of Lord SHAFTES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BURY's <hi>Characteriſtics,</hi> beyond that of moſt other Books, to be idolized by one Party, and deteſted by another. While the firſt regard it as a Work of <hi>perfect Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,</hi> as containing every Thing that can render Mankind wiſe and happy; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are diſpoſed to rank it among the moſt pernicious of Writings, and brand it as one
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1167800100:12"/>
continued Heap of <hi>Fuſtian, Scurrility,</hi> and <hi>Falſehood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Circumſtance hath always appeared to me a Demonſtration, that Paſſion and Prejudice have had a greater Share than Reaſon, in deciding upon the Merits of this Work; which many read with Diſpleaſure, more with Admiration, but few with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judgment. 'Tis probable, the Truth lies between the two Extremes of theſe diſcordant Opinions: and that the noble Writer hath mingled Beauties and Blots, Faults and Excellencies, with a liberal and unſparing Hand.</p>
               <p>THESE, ſo far as they relate to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morals,</hi> it is my preſent Intention to point out, without Regard to the bigoted Cenſures of his Friends or Enemies: While I foreſee, that ſome will <hi>frown</hi> upon me for allowing him any Thing, and others treat me with a <hi>contemptuous Smile</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to differ with him at all.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Thing that occurs to an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Mind, in the Peruſal of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics,</hi> is that generous Spirit of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> which ſhines throughout the whole. The noble Author every where aſſerts that natural Privilege of Man, which hath been
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1167800100:13"/>
ſo often denied him, of ſeeing with his own Eyes, and judging by his own Reaſon. It may poſſibly appear ſtrange to ſome, why he ſhould ſo extremely labour a Point ſo plain. But in Juſtice to his Lordſhip theſe Gentlemen muſt remember, or be informed, that in former Times, ſome well-deſigning Men among ourſelves, from a groundleſs Dread of an unlimited Freedom of the Preſs, attempted to make a moſt unnatural and cruel Separation between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi> Having ſhaken off the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Popery,</hi> and eſtabliſhed what they thought a pure and perfect Syſtem, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ſtopped ſhort in their full Carrier of Glory; prepoſterouſly attempting to deprive others of that common Privilege which they had ſo nobly exerciſed themſelves. This miſtaken Spirit ſeemed entirely ſubdued by the excellent LOCKE, and others, about the Time of the Revolution: But at the Period when our noble Author wrote, it not only revived, but was heightened by a terrible Acceſſion of Bitterneſs and Rancour. Hence thoſe frequent Sallies of Invective, which he throws out againſt this intolerant Principle, which he juſtly ſtigmatizeth as equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic, irrational, and unchriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1167800100:14"/>
'TIS the Glory of our Days, that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Spirit of Perſecution is at leaſt dying away. What Pity that we cannot add, it is wholly extinguiſhed! It is true, we moſt of us profeſs ourſelves Friends to a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Inquiry, <hi>in the Main.</hi> But why, <hi>in the Main?</hi> Why that needleſs Circumſtance of Heſitation? Would we embrace Error? Or do we think that Truth can ſuffer by the moſt rigid Scrutiny? On the contrary, not only the Perfection, but the very Being of Knowledge depends on the Exerciſe of Freedom. For whatever ſome may fear from an open and unlimited Enquiry, it ſeems evidently the only Means vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed us for the Attainment of Truth. The <hi>Abuſe</hi> of it may be <hi>hurtful,</hi> but the <hi>Want</hi> of it is <hi>fatal.</hi> Such, indeed, are the clear and undoubted Principles of our Religion: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſure can theſe Declarations ſurprize us. For if human and political Eſtabliſhments had been ſacred or unviolable, where had been our <hi>Proteſtantiſm;</hi> nay, where our <hi>Chriſtianity?</hi> Dare we then to deſert or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance a Principle, on which not only the Purity, but the very Exiſtence of our Religion depends? Nor is this Principle leſs conſonant with the ſtricteſt Reaſon. It
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1167800100:15"/>
is Falſehood only that loves and retires into Darkneſs. Truth delights in the Day; and demands no more than a juſt Light, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in perfect Beauty. A rigid Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is its only Teſt: For Experience hath taught us, that even <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> can endure the <hi>Fires</hi> of Perſecution: But it is genuine Truth, and that alone, which comes out pure and <hi>unchanged</hi> from the <hi>ſeverer Tortures</hi> of Debate.</p>
               <p>IT will ever be our trueſt Praiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to join the noble Apologiſt in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums on <hi>Freedom;</hi> the only permanent Baſis on which <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Virtue</hi> can be eſtabliſhed. Nor can we leſs approve his frequent Recommendations of <hi>Politeneſs, Chearfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>Good-humour,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of our moſt important Enquiries. The moroſe, contemptuous, and ſurly Species of Compoſition is generally an Appendage to Bigotry, as appears in Inſtances innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, both among the miſtaken Friends and Enemies of Religion. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the amiable Qualities of Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Good-humour, caſt a Kind of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine over a Compoſition, and naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us in Favour of the Writer. They reſemble that gentle Smile that often lights
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1167800100:16"/>
up the human Countenance, the never-failing Indication of a humane Temper. How naturally then muſt we be diſpoſed to liſten; how open our Minds to receive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, when we perceive our Opponent's Intention is benevolent: When we perceive that his Aim is not <hi>Victory,</hi> but <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> that he means not to <hi>inſult,</hi> but to <hi>inſtruct</hi> us.</p>
               <p>SO far, out of an unfeigned Regard to Truth, it ſhould be my Boaſt to take Party with the noble Writer: On the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple it will now be neceſſary to depart from him. For, not content with eſtabliſhing the free Exerciſe of Reaſon, and the Way of Chearfulneſs, in treating the Subjects of Religion and Morals; he revolts from the Principle on which the rational Advocates for Religion were willing to have joined him, and appeals to a new Teſt, <hi>the Teſt of Ridicule.</hi> This, in his two firſt Treatiſes, he attempts to eſtabliſh as a ſurer Method of Conviction: And <hi>that</hi> Ridicule, which had hitherto been employed in <hi>diſgracing known Falſehood,</hi> he informs us, may be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully applied to the <hi>Inveſtigation</hi> of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Truth.</hi>

               <p>'TIS great Pity the noble Author hath not condeſcended to a little more <hi>Preciſion</hi> in treating the Queſtion now before us. He indulges the Gaiety of Spirit, the Freedom of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Humour</hi> ſo far, that a Reader, who ſeeks Information rather than Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is often at a Loſs to know where his Argument, or even his Opinion, lies. This, no doubt, was in Part owing to a generous Abhorrence of <hi>Pedantry,</hi> which he takes all Occaſions of expoſing to Contempt. Yet a better Reaſon may poſſibly be alledged: For in recommending and enforcing the <hi>Uſe of Ridicule,</hi> what could be more natural and proper than the <hi>Power of Ridicule</hi> itſelf? To draw a ſtriking Picture of demure Folly and ſolemn Impoſture, was a Maſterpiece of Prudence: But to have argued <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> would have deſtroyed his Argument: It would have been a tacit Confeſſion, that there is a deeper Foundation, on which

Ridicule itſelf muſt reſt, he muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have overturned, even while he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eſtabliſh this new Pillar, and <hi>Ground of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HERE then we diſcover why the noble Author is ſo witty in Defence of Wit, and chuſes to maintain the Cauſe of Raillery by Raillery itſelf. He ſmiles at his Adverſary, who had attempted to find Coherence in his firſt Letter<note n="a" place="bottom">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1167800100:28"/>
Though Imagination <hi>acquieſce</hi> in falſe Beauty, Reaſon will <hi>reject</hi> it with Diſdain. Thus, although the primary and eſſential End of Poetry is to <hi>pleaſe</hi> by Imitation; yet as it is addreſſed to Man, <hi>Inſtruction</hi> makes a neceſſary, though an <hi>adventitious</hi> Part of its Character<note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <p>Hence the Debate mentioned by <hi>Strabo</hi> (l. i.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Eratoſthenes,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> may eaſily be decided. The firſt inſiſting that <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> the other that <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> was the only End of <hi>Poetry.</hi> They were both wrong: as it appears that theſe two Ends muſt always be united in ſome Degree. However, <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> was nearer the Truth, as he alledged the <hi>eſſential</hi> End. 'Tis no bad Deſcription, given by Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> and others, of the End of Poetry, that it is <q rend="inline">"to <hi>inſtruct</hi> by <hi>pleaſing:</hi>"</q> Though upon the whole, it throws more Weight on the Circumſtance of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> than the Thing will bear. The Admirers of Lord <hi>S.</hi> who love pompous Declamation, may ſee a great deal ſaid on this Subject, and with little Preciſion, in <hi>Strada's</hi> Third Proluſion.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>FROM this View of Things we may, in paſſing, further ſee the <hi>Nature, Limits,</hi> and <hi>comparative Excellence</hi> of the various Kinds of Poetry. The <hi>Deſcriptive</hi> holds entirely
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1167800100:29"/>
of the Imagination, and may be termed <hi>pure Poetry</hi> or Imitation: Yet, with regard to the <hi>ſecondary</hi> End of Inſtruction, it ſeems to merit only the loweſt Place, becauſe it is then perfect when it ſatisfies the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and while it offends not Reaſon, or the Affections, nothing further with regard to theſe Faculties is expected from it. The <hi>Tragic, Comic, Satiric,</hi> and the <hi>Elegy,</hi> as they chiefly regard the <hi>Paſſions</hi> and the Heart of Man, ſo they draw much of their Force from the Sources of <hi>Eloquence.</hi> On the other hand, the <hi>Didactic,</hi> as it makes its chief Application to Reaſon, though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſo much of the Graces of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as to merit the Name of Poetry, is principally of the <hi>logical</hi> Species. The <hi>Epic,</hi> by its great Extent, includes all theſe Kinds by turns, and is therefore the <hi>nobleſt,</hi> both in its <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>ſecondary</hi> Intention. Much indeed hath been occaſionally aſſerted by ſeveral Writers, concerning the ſuperior Dignity of the <hi>tragic</hi> Species<note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <p>Thus the excellent Mr. <hi>Addiſon:</hi>

                     </p> 
                  </note>: But this hath been more in the Way of Aſſirmation than Proof. Their Opinion ſeems to have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1167800100:30"/>
been founded on a miſtaken Interpretation of ARISTOTLE, whoſe ſuppoſed Authority on this Subject hath generally paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned. But whoever ſhall thoroughly examine the Sentiments of the <hi>grand Maſter,</hi> will find he only meant to aſſert, that the <hi>Mode of Imitation</hi> in <hi>Tragedy</hi> is more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore ſuperior to that of the <hi>epic</hi> Kind; becauſe in the <hi>laſt,</hi> the Action is only <hi>told,</hi> in the former, it is <hi>viſibly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</hi> This is the Truth. But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, not the <hi>Mode</hi> of Imitation, but the <hi>Subjects</hi> imitated; if we conſider the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the Action which theſe two Kinds of Poetry can comprehend; and the moral Ends of <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> no leſs than the Variety and Beauty of <hi>Deſcription,</hi> which conſtitutes the very Eſſence of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; we ſhall find the Epic greatly ſuperior, on account of the Extent and Importance of thoſe <hi>Actions,</hi> and the Variety of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> which it is capable of involving. Thus for Inſtance, ſuch an Action as the Death of OEDIPUS or CATO may be more perfectly imitated (becauſe <hi>viſibly</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented) in Tragedy, than in the Epos: But a much greater and more extenſive Action, ſuch as the <hi>Eſtabliſhment of an Empire,</hi> with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1167800100:31"/>
all its ſubordinate Epiſodes, religious, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and moral, cannot be comprehended or exhibited in <hi>Tragedy,</hi> while yet they may be perfectly deſcribed in the <hi>Epopée.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SO much concerning <hi>Poetry</hi> will be found to have Relation to our Subject. But as the Queſtion concerning <hi>Ridicule</hi> will turn chiefly on the proper Subordination of <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> it will be neceſſary to conſider this Kind of Compoſition in a more particular Manner.</p>
               <p>ELOQUENCE then is no other than a Species of Poetry applied to the particular End of Perſuaſion. For Perſuaſion can only be effected by rowzing the Paſſions of the Soul; and theſe, we have ſeen, are only to be moved by a Force impreſſed on the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, aſſuming the Appearance of Truth; which is the eſſential Nature of poetical Compoſition. Thus the Lord VERULAM: <q rend="inline">"In all Perſuaſions that are wrought by Eloquence, and other Impreſſion of like Nature, which paint and diſguiſe the true Appearance of Things, the chief Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation unto <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is from the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi>

So that every Opinion which Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence inſtills, though it be the pure Reſult of certain fictitious Images impreſſed on the Fancy, is always regarded as the Reſult of rational Conviction, and received by the Mind as Truth.</p>

But where the End is Perſuaſion, the Diſcovery of his Art muſt defeat its Force and Deſign. For ere he can perſuade, he muſt ſeem to apply to his Hearer's <hi>Reaſon,</hi> while, in Fact, he is working on his Imagination and Affections: Now this, once known, muſt defeat his Purpoſe; becauſe nothing can perſuade but what has the <hi>Appearance of Truth.</hi>

we find, that no ſooner was the popular Government deſtroy'd, and the ſupreme Power lodged in a ſingle Hand, than Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence began ſenſibly to languiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: The mighty Orators, who could ſway the Paſſions of a mixed Multitude, found their Art baffled and overthrown when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the cool Determinations of cunning Miniſters, or the determined Will of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Maſters.

               <p>BUT whatever of Truth there may be in this Conjecture; ſo much is evident, that the Scene where alone Eloquence can work its mighty Effects, is that of a <hi>popular Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</hi> An abſolute Monarchy quencheth it at once.

it leads it to acquieſce upon a falſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: It puts the Hearer or Reader in the Speaker's or Writer's Power: And though he be ſo honeſt as to lead him in the Path of Truth, yet ſtill he leads him <hi>blind-fold.</hi> In this Senſe, and under this Limitation, Mr. LOCKE's Remark is true: <q rend="inline">"We muſt allow that all the Art of Rhetoric, beſides Order and Clearneſs, all the artificial and figurative Application of Words Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence hath invented, are for nothing elſe but to <hi>inſinuate wrong</hi> Ideas, <hi>move the Paſſions,</hi> and <hi>thereby miſlead</hi> the Judgment, and ſo indeed are perfect Cheats<note n="y" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>But if we regard what is of more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to Man, than mere ſpeculative Truth, I mean the <hi>practical Ends</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life and moral Action; then Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence aſſumes a higher Nature: Nor is there, in this practical Senſe, any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Connexion between <hi>moving</hi> the Paſſions, and <hi>miſleading</hi> the Judgment. For though the Ends of Truth and Perſuaſion are then eſſentially different when the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſtrikes the Imagination with fictitious Images, in which caſe Falſehood becomes apparent Truth, and Eloquence the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1167800100:41"/>
of Deceit; yet the Ends of Perſuaſion and Conviction, Opinion and Knowledge <hi>concur,</hi> when ſuch Impreſſions are made on the Imagination and Paſſions, as conſiſt with the Dictates of right Reaſon. In this caſe, Eloquence comes in to the Aid of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>impreſſes</hi> the Truths which Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic teaches, in a warmer and more effectual Manner. It paints real Good and Evil in all the glowing Colours of Imagination, and thus inflames the Heart with double Ardor to embrace the one, and reject the other.</p>
               <p>NAY, ſo far is Eloquence from being the univerſal Inſtrument of practical Deceit; that on the contrary, it ſhould ſeem, the <hi>moral</hi> is more natural than the <hi>immoral</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it. Becauſe, ere the diſhoneſt Application can take place, Circumſtances muſt be wreſted, and Miſrepreſentations impoſed on the Fancy, in Oppoſition to Truth and Reaſon: Whereas in the proper Application, nothing further is neceſſary, than to draw out and impreſs thoſe Images and Analogies of Things, which really exiſt in Nature.</p>
               <p>IT may be further obſerved, that as Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is of a vague, unſteady Nature,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1167800100:42"/>
merely relative to the Imaginations and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Mankind; ſo there muſt be ſeveral Orders or Degrees of it, ſubordinate to each other in Dignity, yet each perfect in their Kind. The common <hi>End</hi> of each is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion: The <hi>Means</hi> are different according to the various Capacities, Fancies, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of thoſe whom the Artiſt attempts to perſuade. The pathetic Orator, who throws a <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> into Tears and Groanings, would raiſe Affections of a very different Nature, ſhould he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to proſelyte an <hi>Engliſh Parliament:</hi> As on the other hand, the fineſt Speaker that ever commanded <hi>the Houſe,</hi> would in vain point the Thunder of his Eloquence on a <hi>Quaker-meeting.</hi> So again, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Oratory (if it may be called ſo) of the <hi>Bar,</hi> at a <hi>Country Aſſize</hi> (for the higher Courts of Juſtice admit not Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) it is eaſy to obſerve, what a different Tour the learned Council takes, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Judge</hi> or <hi>Jury:</hi> He is well aware, that what paſſes with the <hi>one</hi> for <hi>Argument</hi> of Proof, would be derided by the <hi>other</hi> as paſtboard <hi>Declamation.</hi> This Difference in the Kind, with reſpect to the Eloquence of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> is no leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1167800100:43"/>
in different Countries. Thus the very agreeable and ſenſible VOLTAIRE obſerves, that <q rend="inline">"in <hi>France (where Reaſoning hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Connexion with Religion)</hi> a Sermon is a long Declamation, ſpoken with Rapture and Enthuſiaſm: That in <hi>Italy (where Taſte and Vertú give a Tincture to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition itſelf)</hi> a Sermon is a Kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional Comedy: That in <hi>England (where Religion ſubmits to Reaſon)</hi> it is a ſolid Diſſertation, <hi>ſometimes a dry one,</hi> which is read to the Congregation without Action or Elocution<note n="z" place="bottom">
                        <p>The Paſſage in the Original is thus: <q rend="inline">"Un ſermon en France eſt une longue declamation ſcrupuleuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diviſée en trois points, et recitée avec enthou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſme. En Angleterre un ſermon eſt une diſſertation ſolide, <hi>et quelqueſois ſeche,</hi> qu'un homme lit au peu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſans geſte, et ſans aucune eclat de voix. En Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie c'eſt une comedie ſpirituelle."</q>
                        </p>
                     </note>."</q> And he juſtly concludes, that the Diſcourſe which raiſeth a French Audience to the higheſt Pitch of Devotion, would throw an <hi>Engliſh</hi> one into a Fit of Laughter.</p>
               <p>HENCE too, and hence alone, we may account for a Fact, which, however, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly improbable, is too well-known to be doubted of: <q rend="inline">"That although in <hi>France,</hi> the applauded Pulpit Eloquence is of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1167800100:44"/>
                     <hi>Enthuſiaſtic,</hi> in <hi>England</hi> of the ſevere and <hi>rational</hi> Species; yet the Taſte of theſe two Nations in Tragedy or <hi>Theatrical Eloquence,</hi> is mutually <hi>reverſed:</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are Enthuſiaſtic; the <hi>French</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and rational."</q> Now, though this Fact may carry the Appearance of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradiction, yet on the Principle here laid down, the known Circumſtances of the two Kingdoms will explain it ſufficiently. In <hi>England,</hi> a general Spirit of <hi>Reaſoning</hi> and Enquiry hath extinguiſhed the natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms of the human Mind in <hi>religious Subjects;</hi> while our unreſtrained Warmth of Imagination, and habitual Reverence for the noble Irregularities of SHAKESPEAR, concur to make us deſpiſe the rigid Laws of the Stage: On the contrary, in <hi>France,</hi> the Severities of the <hi>Academy</hi> have utterly quenched the high Tragic Spirit; while, as yet, <hi>religious Criticiſm</hi> hath made but little Progreſs among the Subjects of the <hi>moſt Chriſtian King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN further Proof of this Principle, we may appeal to ancient Fact: To the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Eloquence in <hi>Greece.</hi> There we find, it firſt appeared, decked in all the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Colours of Poetry: afterwards, in an
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1167800100:45"/>
Age of more poliſhed Manners and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Knowledge, when the Rhetors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to carry this Kind of Eloquence to a ſtill higher Degree, they found the Times would not bear it: They were baffled in their Attempt. As ſucceeding Ages grew more knowing, they grew more faſtidious and refined: The Orators were obliged gradually to lower and bring down Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from its high Standard: Till at length it gained a Form and Character en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely new, as we find it in XENOPHON's chaſtiſed Manner of <hi>Attic</hi> Elegance<note n="a" place="bottom">

               <p>TO conclude with one Proof more in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of this Principle.

Thus by overlooking the <hi>relative</hi> Nature of Eloquence, they mutually fell into an Extreme; both forgetting, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Kinds might be of ſuperior Propriety and Force, according to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, Paſſions, and Capacities of thoſe to whom they ſhould be applied.

For as the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Paſſions are then moſt refined and juſt, when they bear to the ſame Point with Reaſon; ſo, that Species of Eloquence is the nobleſt which tends to conduct them thither<note n="f" place="bottom">

alone, we may with Propriety and Preciſion determine the comparative Excellence and Dignity of thoſe who aſpire to the Palm of Eloquence. On this Principle it ſeems to be, that a ſevere, but able, Judge prefers DEMOSTHENES to TULLY<note n="g" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>See Dr. Swift's Letter to a Young Clergyman.</bibl>
                  </note>: and on this Principle he deſerves the Preference.</p>
               <p>THUS we are at length arrived at the Point where Eloquence and Argument, Perſuaſion and Conviction unite; where the Orator's Art becomes ſubſervient to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>Truth,</hi> and only labours to adorn and recommend Her.</p>
               <p>WE come now to the third Species of Compoſition, that of <hi>Argument:</hi> Which applying ſolely to the Reaſon of Man, and to the Proof or Inveſtigation of Truth, is of a more ſimple and uncompounded Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in its Principles, and therefore needs not to be ſo particularly explained. For Pleaſure being the primary End of Poetry, and Perſuaſion that of Eloquence, the real Nature of Things is often in Part diſguiſed, and compelled to bend to the Imagination
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1167800100:49"/>
and the Paſſions: But <hi>Truth</hi> being the End of Argument, the varying Colours of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Paſſion muſt be drawn off; and human Reaſon itſelf bend to the real, uniform Nature of Things.</p>
               <p>YET on this Occaſion it may be proper to remark, that the <hi>rational Faculty</hi> in Man cannot be comprehenſive or perfect in its Operations, without a Union with a <hi>ſtrong Imagination.</hi> And this, not only in the Arts of Poetry or Eloquence, but in the <hi>ſevereſt Inveſtigations</hi> of Truth. For Reaſon alone cannot ſearch out new Ideas, but only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and diſtinguiſh thoſe which Senſe and Imagination preſent to her, and the Senſes being of ſmall Extent, Imagination is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great univerſal Inſtrument of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Knowledge and human Action. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aids of Imagination therefore, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon works in a contracted Sphere; being deſtitute of Materials; unable to make the neceſſary Excurſions into the Immenſity of Nature; and wanting that Power which alone can range through the whole Extent of created Being, and bring Home all the poſſible and apparent Analogies of Things, ſetting them before her diſcerning Eye, and ſubmitting them to her ſovereign Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1167800100:50"/>
or Diſlike. From this noble Union ariſes that <hi>boundleſs Penetration,</hi> which ſo far ſurpaſſeth <hi>mere Judgment:</hi> and which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is exerted in Poetry, Eloquence, Philoſophy, Morals, or Religion, ſtrikes into the various and untroden Paths of Nature and Truth; forms the diſtinguiſhed Names of HOMER, SHAKESPEAR, MILTON, DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOSTHENES, TULLY, ARISTOTLE, BACON, LOCKE, BAYLE, PASCAL, NEWTON, HOOKER, BERKLEY, WARBURTON, giving that eſſential Superiority and Preheminence, which hath ever been, firſt the <hi>Envy,</hi> and then the <hi>Admiration</hi> of Mankind.</p>
               <p>THUS as it appeared above, how neceſſary the Reſtraints of Reaſon are, to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Works of Imagination; ſo here it is evident, that a full Union of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is neceſſary to the perfect Operations of Reaſon. Taken ſingly, they are each <hi>defective:</hi> When their Powers are joined, they conſtitute TRUE GENIUS.</p>
               <p>BUT, however requiſite the Force of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination may be, to the Perfection of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Production of <hi>true Genius,</hi> yet ſtill Reaſon remains the ſuperior and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective Power: Therefore every Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Poetry or Eloquence, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1167800100:51"/>
only apply to the Fancy and Affections, muſt finally be examined and decided upon, muſt be <hi>tried, rejected,</hi> or <hi>received,</hi> as the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning Faculty</hi> ſhall <hi>determine.</hi>

By doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this in our Remarks on the three different Kinds of Compoſition, we have enabled the intelligent Reader to ſee with eaſe: <q rend="inline">"That Wit, Raillery, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, in every Shape they can poſſibly aſſume, are no other than ſo many Species of <hi>Poetry</hi> or <hi>Eloquence.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>PURE <hi>Wit,</hi> when not applied to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Men, is properly a Species of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It amuſes and delights the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by thoſe ſudden Aſſemblages and pleaſing Pictures of Things which it creates: and from every common Occaſion can raiſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1167800100:52"/>
ſuch ſtriking Appearances, as throw the moſt phlegmatic Tempers into a Convulſion of good-humoured Mirth, and <hi>undeſigning Laughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT <hi>Ridicule</hi> or <hi>Raillery,</hi> which is the Subject of our Inquiry, hath a further Scope and Intention. It ſolely regards the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Paſſions, Actions, and Characters of Men: and may properly be denominated <q rend="inline">"that Species of Writing which excites Contempt with Laughter."</q>
               </p>
               <p>STILL more particularly we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that as Eloquence in general is but the Application of Poetry to the End of Perſuaſion, ſo Ridicule in particular is no more than the Application of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Species of Poetry called Wit, to the ſame End of Perſuaſion. It tends to excite <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> in the ſame Manner as the other Modes of Eloquence raiſe Love, Pity, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Rage, or Hatred, in the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man.</p>
               <p>NOW, that <hi>Contempt</hi> which certain Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects raiſe in the Mind, is a particular <hi>Mode of Paſſion.</hi> The Objects of this Paſſion are apparent <hi>Falſehood, Incongruity, Impropriety,</hi> or <hi>Turpitude</hi> of certain Kinds. But as the Object of every excited Paſſion muſt be examined by Reaſon ere we can determine
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1167800100:53"/>
whether it be proper or improper, real or fictitious; ſo, every Object that excites Contempt muſt fall under this general Rule. Thus, before it can be determined whether our Contempt be <hi>juſt,</hi> Reaſon alone muſt <hi>examine</hi> Circumſtances, ſeparate Ideas, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Truth from its Appearances, decide upon, reſtrain, and <hi>correct the Paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Ridicule</hi> is no other than a <hi>Species of Eloquence:</hi> and accordingly we find it mentioned and expreſly treated as ſuch, by the beſt Writers of Antiquity.

               <p>NOW, in Conſequence of theſe Proofs, a few Obſervations will naturally ariſe with regard to <hi>Ridicule in particular,</hi> ſimilar to thoſe which were made in the laſt Section, upon <hi>Eloquence in general.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS firſt: Ridicule muſt render every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it ſupports <hi>apparently true,</hi> ere it can be received and acquieſced it. Thus every Opinion which Ridicule inſtills, tho' it be the pure Reſult of certain Images im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on the Imagination, by which the Paſſion of Contempt is excited, is always
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1167800100:56"/>
regarded as the Conviction of Reaſon, and received by the Mind as Truth. And thus by offering apparent Truth, Ridicule gains its End of Perſuaſion.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, it may be obſerved, that the Conſequences of Ridicule with regard to <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Inſtruction or Inquiry, are of a very different Nature from thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Morals and Action. To the firſt it muſt ever be an <hi>Enemy:</hi> But to the latter it may be an Enemy or Friend according as it is fairly or diſhoneſtly applied. It comes in to the Aid of Argument, when its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on the Imagination and Paſſions are conſiſtent with the real Nature of Things: When it ſtrikes the Fancy and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections with fictitious Images, it becomes the Inſtrument of Deceit.</p>
               <p>THUS Ridicule may befriend either Truth or Falſehood: and as it is morally or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morally applied, may illuſtrate the one, or diſguiſe the other. Yet it ſhould ſeem, that the moral is more natural, than the immoral Application of Ridicule; inaſmuch as Truth is more congenial to the Mind than Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and ſo, the <hi>real</hi> more eaſily made <hi>apparent,</hi> than the <hi>ſictitious</hi> Images of Things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1167800100:57"/>
RIDICULE, therefore, being of a vague, unſteady Nature, merely relative to the Imaginations and Paſſions of Mankind, there muſt be ſeveral Orders or Degrees of it, ſuited to the Fancies and Capacities of thoſe whom the Artiſt attempts to influence. Among theſe ſeveral Kinds of Ridicule, Juſtneſs of Thought and Expreſſion, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtriking Figures, is the <hi>higheſt:</hi> Coarſe Language, Buffoonry, falſe and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Images, are the Characters of the <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi> For as the Imagination and Paſſions are then moſt refined and juſt, when they bear to the ſame Point with Reaſon; ſo, that Species of Ridicule is moſt genuine which tends to conduct them thither.</p>
               <p>BUT, however Ridicule may <hi>impreſs</hi> the Idea of apparent Turpitude or Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood on the Imagination; yet ſtill Reaſon remains the ſuperior and corrective Power. Therefore, every Repreſentation of Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, which only applies to the Fancy and Affections, muſt <hi>finally</hi> be <hi>examined</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided</hi> upon, muſt be <hi>tried, rejected,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> as the <hi>reaſoning Faculty</hi> ſhall <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND thus <hi>Ridicule</hi> can never be a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of Falſehood,</hi> or a <hi>Teſt of Truth.</hi>

               <p>IN further Confirmation of theſe Truths, the direct Proofs of which may poſſibly lie ſomewhat remote from common Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, let us appeal to Experience; to the general Senſe and Practice of Mankind. And here we ſhall find, that Contempt and Ridicule are always founded on <hi>preconceived Opinion,</hi> whatever be the Foundation of it, whether <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Imagination, Truth</hi> or <hi>Falſehood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOR in Fact, do not we ſee every diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Party and Aſſociation of Men deſpiſing and deriding each other according to their various Manner of Thought, Speech, and Action? Does not the Courtier deride the Foxhunter, and the Foxhunter the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier? What is more ridiculous to a Beau, than a Philoſopher; to a Philoſopher, than a Beau? Drunkards are the Jeſt of ſober Men, and ſober Men of Drunkards. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, Lawyers, Soldiers, Prieſts, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkers, are the ſtanding Subjects of Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule to one another. Wiſdom and Folly, the Virtuous and the Vile, the Learned and Ignorant, the Temperate and Debauched,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1167800100:59"/>
all give and return the Jeſt. According to the various Impreſſions of Fancy and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the Aſpects of Things are varied; and conſequently the ſame Object, ſeen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe different Lights and Attitudes, muſt in one Mind produce <hi>Approbation,</hi> in another <hi>Contempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF we examine the Conduct of <hi>political</hi> Bodies or <hi>religious</hi> Sects, we ſhall find it of a ſimilar Nature. Each of theſe <hi>railly</hi> every other, according to the Prejudices they have imbibed in Favour of their own Syſtem.

The Caſe is parallel with regard to religious Tenets, where Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are at Liberty to ſpeak their Thoughts. Is there any Species of Invective which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not exerciſed upon all who have diſſented from its Meaſures? And have not the Divines of the <hi>reformed</hi> Churches been as arrant <hi>Droles,</hi> in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their reſpective Syſtems? What Ribaldry and coarſe Banter hath been thrown (nay rather, what hath <hi>not</hi> been thrown) by the <hi>Freethinkers,</hi> on Religion and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity?</hi> And how baſely have ſome of our Divines proſtituted their Pens in former Days, by deſcending to the ſame dirty Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel?

               <p>BUT what need we wonder that a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Opinion in ſuch weighty Affairs as thoſe of Government and Religion ſhould inſpire a mutual Contempt, when we ſee that any conſiderable Variation of Manners in the moſt ordinary Circumſtances of Life has the ſame Effect?

               <p>THE noble Author tells us next, that <q rend="inline">"nothing is Proof againſt Raillery, except what is handſome and juſt."</q>—Perhaps, nor <hi>that</hi> neither. Though it be true, that nothing of the oppoſite Kind is proof againſt Raillery; yet ſure it is a ſtrange Miſtake to imagine, that what is really handſome and juſt is always Proof againſt it.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1167800100:80"/>
It is only an occaſional, though, indeed, a pretty cloſe, attendant, ſince this other Maxim was taken for granted, that <hi>Reaſon was the Teſt of Truth.</hi> Let once his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's be generally embraced, that <hi>Ridicule</hi> is ſo, and we ſhould ſoon ſee <hi>Buffoonry</hi> as cloſe an Attendant on Impoſture as now <hi>Gravity.</hi> The Tryal has been made; and ſucceſsfully enough too, by him who has kept the Multitude in Opinion for twenty Years together; and by this Time, perhaps, himſelf, that Learning and Religion are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taught in his Conventicle, than in all the Univerſities and Churches of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> put together. And ſure if any thing be the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of his <hi>Impoſture,</hi> it is <hi>Buffoonry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND here let us not forget to obſerve, that the noble Writer often (as in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage laſt cited) confounds <hi>Mirth, Urbanity,</hi> or <hi>Good-humour,</hi> with <hi>Raillery</hi> or <hi>Ridicule:</hi> Than which, no two Things in Nature are more diametrically oppoſite. The firſt, as it ariſeth ſolely from <hi>ſudden</hi> and <hi>pleaſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances</hi> impreſſed on the Imagination, is juſtly regarded by all, as the beſt <hi>Mediator</hi> in every Debate. The laſt, as it ariſeth ſolely from <hi>Contempt,</hi> is therefore no leſs juſtly regarded by moſt, as an <hi>Embroiler</hi> and

                  <hi>Incendiary.</hi> He ſets out with a formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of proving the Efficacy of Humour and Ridicule in the Inveſtigation of Truth: Yet, by ſhifting and mixing his Terms, he generally ſlides inſenſibly into mere Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums on <hi>Good-breeding, Chearfulneſs, Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banity,</hi> and <hi>free Enquiry;</hi> and then, from theſe Premiſes, often draws Conſequences in Favour of <hi>Ridicule,</hi> as if it were an <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Term.</hi> This indeed keeps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like an Argument on Foot, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leads the ſuperficial Reader.</p>
               <p>BUT the noble Author triumphs in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Obſervation: When ſpeaking of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Zealots,</hi> he tells us, that <q rend="inline">"whatever they think grave and ſolemn, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe muſt never be treated out of a grave and ſolemn Way.

in Religion or Freethinking, I ſhall not compliment as Exceptions to the Truth of it. There is ſcarce a Topic of Religion, either for its Diſhonour or Support, that hath not been expoſed to the illiberal Jokes of ſome Bungler in Controverſy. And a much coarſer Advocate in the Cauſe of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule<note n="r" place="bottom">Suppoſed to be Mr. Collins.</note>, hath wrote an elaborate and moſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Diſſertation, to prove that the Way of Raillery hath been ſucceſsfully applied by every Sect of Religioniſts and Infidels, to the Deſtruction of each other's Tenets, and the Eſtabliſhment of their own. How he gains his Concluſion, that an Engine which tends to fix Mankind in their preconceived Opinions, and eſtabliſh ſo many Species of Error, is of Importance and Efficacy in the Search of Truth, may not be ſo eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. In the mean time, in Reply to his whole Treatiſe, as well as to the laſt mentioned Remark of our noble Author, it may be ſufficient to obſerve, that Mankind often retain their own, and oppoſe others' Opinions, from an imperfect View of the Nature of Things: Their peculiar Tenets in Religion, as in other Subjects, are often founded in Imagination only: Their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1167800100:83"/>
to thoſe of others are often as groundleſs and fanciful. How natural then is it for them to communicate their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions on that Foundation on which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them? How natural, that they ſhould throw the Colours of Imagination on the Tenets they oppoſe? That they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude the like fictitious Images on others, which themſelves have embraced as Truth? That they ſhould hold forth Appearances for Realities; employ Eloquence inſtead of Logick; and endeavour to <hi>perſuade</hi> whom they ſhould, but cannot, <hi>convince?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſeems therefore that his Lordſhip's Obſervation (which contains the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Aſſociate's Work, and which probably was the <hi>Leaven</hi> that <hi>leavened</hi> the whole <hi>Lump</hi> of Malice and Dulneſs) inſtead of being favourable to Ridicule as a Teſt of Truth, can only tend to diſgrace it. For ſince every religious and unbelieving Sect hath <hi>alike ſucceſsfully</hi> employed it in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their reſpective Tenets, and in render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe of their Adverſaries contemptible; it follows, inaſmuch as Doctrines which are eſſentially repugnant cannot all be true, that RIDICULE IS ONE OF THE MOST POWER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FUL

SO far, for Peace ſake, we venture to agree with the noble Writer: But now comes a finiſhing Stroke indeed.</p>
               <p>FOR he proceeds to congratulate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age, that in the Beginnings of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, when Popery had got Poſſeſſion, <hi>Smithfield</hi> was uſed in a more <hi>tragical Way.</hi> And that <q rend="inline">"had not the Prieſts, as is uſual, preferred the Love of Blood to all other Paſſions, they might in a <hi>merrier Way,</hi> perhaps, have <hi>evaded the greateſt Force of our reforming Spirit</hi>

               </p>
               <p>AND now, for Form's ſake, let us ſuppoſe the noble Author to be what he aſſumes, a Friend to Religion and Reformation: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Character, he recommends <hi>Ridicule</hi> to us, as of ſovereign Uſe to inveſtigate Truth, try Honeſty, and unmaſk formal Hypocriſy and Error. To prove this Uſe, he tells us, what we ſhould leaſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that if, inſtead of the tragical Way of <hi>Smithfield,</hi> the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the comic Drollery of Bart'lmy-Fair, they had perhaps gained their Point, and <hi>evaded the greateſt Force of our reforming Spirit.</hi> Here the noble Writer forgets his Part, which is that of a <hi>Believer</hi> and a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:1167800100:86"/>
But, in his Scarcity of Proofs for the <hi>Uſe</hi> of Ridicule, he has put the Change upon us, and perhaps upon himſelf, and offered at one to ſhew its <hi>Force:</hi> Which, without doubt, muſt wonderfully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the Favour of all ſober Men. Here then lies the Dilemma: Let his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers then get him off as they can. If their Maſter be a Believer, he has reaſoned ill; if a Freethinker, he has managed worſe. Had he been a little more knowing in the Times he ſpeaks of, he might have found an Inſtance more pertinent to his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and more conformable to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; an Inſtance which ſhews, not what <hi>Ridicule</hi> might be ſuppoſed capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but what it actually effected. And this not to ſtop <hi>Reformation,</hi> but to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit <hi>Popery.</hi> Biſhop BURNET tells us, that in the Year 1542, <q rend="inline">"Plays and Interludes were a great Abuſe: In them, Mock-Repreſentations were made, both of the Clergy and of the Pageantry of their Worſhip.

               <p>THIS curious Piece of Hiſtory is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; and tends no leſs to ſupport our general Argument, than to recommend, what the noble Writer is pleaſed to ſnear at, the Sobriety <hi>of our reforming Spirit.

that you ought to confound your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary's ſerious Argument by Raillery, and his Raillery by ſerious Argument."</q> This is almoſt a literal Tranſlation of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.

               <p>BUT as the noble Writer hath tranſlated the Paſſage, it is a Curioſity indeed. <q rend="inline">"Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is the only Teſt of Gravity, and Gravity of Humour."</q> He applies it not to Eloquence, but Philoſophy; not to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, but Conviction. And ſo, by the ſtrangeſt Converſion in Nature, makes the Trier, and the Thing tried, each in their turns, become Agent and Patient to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But what Artiſt ever attempted to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1167800100:94"/>
                  <hi>try</hi> the Juſtneſs of his <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Level,</hi> by the Work which he has formed by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of thoſe Inſtruments? Or was ever the Gold which hath been put to the Teſt, reciprocally applied to <hi>try</hi> the Touch-Stone? If therefore <hi>Gravity,</hi> or Reaſoning, be the Teſt of <hi>Humour;</hi> Humour never can be the Teſt of Gravity: As on the other hand, if Humour be the Teſt of Gravity, then Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity can never be the Teſt of Humour.</p>
               <p>SINCE therefore this <hi>ſee-ſaw</hi> Kind of Proof returns into itſelf, and conſequently ends in an Abſurdity; 'tis plain, that one half of the noble Writer's Propoſition muſt effectually deſtroy the other: Let us ſee then, which Moiety deſerves to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. His own Comment on the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage will help us to determine. Which however, he ſeems deſirous his Reader ſhould receive as a Part of the <hi>Saying of his ancient Sage:</hi> But whoever will turn to the Paſſage, as it lies in ARISTOTLE, will find that GORGIAS is entirely innocent of the whole Affair.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"GRAVITY, ſays his Lordſhip, is the Teſt of <hi>Humour:</hi> Becauſe a Jeſt that will not bear a ſerious Examination, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly falſe Wit."</q> True: here we have a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1167800100:95"/>
rational Teſt eſtabliſhed. Next he inverts the Propoſition, ſets it with its Head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, like a Traytor's Scutcheon, and now, ſays he, behold <q rend="inline">"Humour is the Teſt of Gravity."</q> To prove this, Reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires he ſhould have added, <q rend="inline">"Becauſe an Argument, which can be ſucceſsfully ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed, is certainly falſe Logic."</q> But this was too hardy a Propoſition to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly advanced: He therefore contents himſelf with hinting, that <q rend="inline">"a Subject which will not bear Raillery <hi>is ſuſpicious!</hi>"</q> Now we know, that <hi>Suſpicion</hi> is often ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: That what is ſuſpected to be falſe, may yet be true. So that the noble Writer again ſuffers this new Teſt to ſlip through his Fingers, even while he is holding it up to your Admiration. But if any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be neceſſary to clear up this Point, it may be obſerved in ſhort, that Gravity or Argument is the Teſt of Humour, becauſe Reaſon marks the real Differences of Things: That Humour can never be the Teſt of Gravity, becauſe Imagination can only ſuggeſt their apparent Analogies.</p>
               <p>THUS the Sentiment of GORGIAS is groſly miſtaken or deſignedly miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the noble Writer: as it lies in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1167800100:96"/>
ARISTOTLE, it is rational and conſiſtent; as it is taken up by his Lordſhip, it is chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical and groundleſs.</p>
               <p>IT might have been difficult to aſſign a Reaſon, why the noble Writer ſhould have attempted to eſtabliſh this <hi>two-fold</hi> Method of Proof, had not he explained his Intention in another Place. He there<note n="d" place="bottom">

For as Clubs and <hi>Cudgels</hi> have long been appropriated to Porters and Footmen, while every Gentleman is ambitious to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a <hi>Sword;</hi> ſo the clumſy Way of <hi>Argumentation</hi> is only fit for Prieſts and Pedants, but <hi>pointed</hi> Wit is the Weapon for the Man of Faſhion: This decides a Quarrel <hi>handſomely.</hi> The <hi>pretty Fellow</hi> is at your Vitals in a Moment; while the Pedant keeps labouring at it for an Hour together, and neither gets nor gives ſo much as a broken Bone.</p>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1167800100:97"/>
BUT ſtill higher is the noble Writer's Idea of Wit and Ridicule: While he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it not only to <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> but <hi>Inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And we muſt own, it was an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt worthy of his Genius, to eſtabliſh this new and <hi>expeditious</hi> Method of Search and Conviction. In which, by the ſole Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſo cheap and <hi>portable an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> as that of <hi>Raillery,</hi> a Gentleman might obtain the certain Knowledge of the <hi>true Proportion</hi> of Things, without the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and vulgar Methods of <hi>Menſuration.</hi> In the mean Time, we, whom the noble Author hath ſo often condeſcended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh by the honourable Title of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts and Pedants, finding ourſelves inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this <hi>ſublime</hi> Way of Proof, muſt be content to drudge on in the old and beaten Track of <hi>Reaſoning.</hi> And after all, 'tis probable this new Attempt will ſucceed no better than the curious Conceit of the <hi>learned Taylor</hi> in <hi>Laputa:</hi> Who being employed in making a <hi>Suit</hi> for the facetious GULLIVER; diſdained the <hi>vulgar Meaſures</hi> of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and took that Gentleman's <hi>Altitude</hi> by the Help of a <hi>Quadrant.</hi> This, it muſt be acknowledged, was a Theory no leſs ſublime than our noble Author's: Yet it

               <p>WE have now obviated every thing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, that the noble Writer hath advanced in Support of his new Syſtem.

                  </note>, it may be proper to examine how far this Gentleman's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is conſiſtent with Truth.</p>
               <p>HE tells us, that <q rend="inline">"to aſk whether Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule be a Teſt of Truth, is in other Words to aſk, whether that which is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous can be morally true, can be juſt and becoming; or whether that which is juſt and becoming, can be ridiculous."</q>
               </p>
               <p>HERE, as the Foundation of all, we ſee the ſame Kind of Ambiguity lurking, as was obſerved in the noble Writer, in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage already remarked on<note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>See above, p. 55.</bibl>

which is ridiculous,"</q> he means that which is <hi>really</hi> ridiculous, it is allowed this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be morally true: But this is ſo far from proving Ridicule to be a Teſt of Truth, that it implies the contrary: It implies ſome further Power, which may be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh what is <hi>really</hi> ridiculous, from what is only <hi>apparently</hi> ſo. On the contrary, if by <q rend="inline">"that which is ridiculous,"</q> he means that which is <hi>apparently</hi> ridiculous, it may be affirmed, this may be morally true: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Imagination and Paſſion often take up with Fictions inſtead of Realities, and can never of themſelves diſtinguiſh them from each other. He tells us his Queſtion <q rend="inline">"does not deſerve a ſerious Anſwer."</q> At leaſt it wanted an Explanation.</p>
               <p>THE Gentleman proceeds: <q rend="inline">"For it is moſt evident, that as in a metaphyſical Propoſition offered to the Underſtanding for its Aſſent, <hi>the Faculty of Reaſon</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the Terms of the Propoſition, and finding one Idea which was ſuppoſed equal to another, to be in Fact unequal, of Conſequence rejects the Propoſition as a Falſehood: So in Objects offered to the Mind for its Eſteem or Applauſe, the <hi>Faculty of Ridicule</hi> feeling an Incongruity in

the Claim, urges the Mind to reject it with Laughter and Contempt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>HERE the <hi>Faculty of Reaſon</hi> is excluded from the Examination of moral Truths, and a <hi>new</hi> Faculty, never before heard of, <hi>the Faculty of Ridicule,</hi> is ſubſtituted in its Place. Now, when a <hi>Stranger</hi> is introduced into good Company, and ſure theſe can be no better than the <hi>Public,</hi> it is uſual not only to tell his Name, but <hi>what he is,</hi> and what his <hi>Character:</hi> This, the Gentleman hath not condeſcended to do: 'Tis true, in a preceding Page he tells us, that <q rend="inline">"the Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ridicule is not a bare Perception of the Agreement or Diſagreement of Ideas; but a <hi>Paſſion or Emotion of the Mind, conſequential to that Perception.</hi>"</q> In another Place he expreſly calls it <q rend="inline">"a gay Contempt."</q> Now, if the <hi>Faculty of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule</hi> be the ſame as the <hi>Senſation of Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule,</hi> or <hi>a gay Contempt,</hi> then by ſubſtituting the plain old Term of <hi>Contempt,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Faculty of Ridicule,</hi> we ſhall clearly ſee what the above cited Paſſage contains. <q rend="inline">"As in a metaphyſical Propoſition, the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Reaſon</hi> examines the Terms, and rejects the Falſehood; ſo in Objects of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Mind for its Eſteem and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,

               </p>
               <p>WE ſhall now clearly diſcover the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction that is to be made on the following Paſſage: <q rend="inline">"And thus a double Advantage is gained: For we both <hi>detect</hi> the moral Falſehood <hi>ſooner</hi> than in the Way of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Enquiry, and impreſs the Minds of Men with a ſtronger Senſe of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Error of its Authors<note n="g" place="bottom">

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"BUT it is ſaid, continues he, that the Practice is dangerous, and may be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Regard we owe to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of real Dignity and Excellence<note n="h" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Ibid. p. 106.</bibl>
                     </note>."</q> Yet this is but a ſecondary Objection: The principal one is, <hi>that the Attempt is abſurd.</hi> However, the Circumſtance of Danger is not without its Weight: Nor is the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's reply at all ſufficient—<q rend="inline">"that the Practice fairly managed can never be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous."</q> For though Men are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt in obtruding falſe Circumſtances upon us, we may be ſo <hi>weak</hi> as to <hi>obtrude</hi> them upon ourſelves. Nay, it can hardly be otherwiſe, if, inſtead of exerting our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to correct the Suggeſtions of Fancy and Paſſion, we give them an unlimited Range, and acquieſce in their partial or groundleſs Repreſentations, without calling in Reaſon to decide upon their Truth or Falſehood.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1167800100:103"/>
By this means we ſhall often <q rend="inline">"view Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of real Dignity and Excellence,"</q> in ſuch Shapes and Colours as are foreign to their Nature; and then ſit down and laugh moſt profoundly at the Phantoms of our own creating.</p>
               <p>BUT ſtill he inſiſts, that though falſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances be impoſed upon us, yet <q rend="inline">"the Senſe of Ridicule always <hi>judges right,</hi>"</q> or in more vulgar Terms, <q rend="inline">"The Paſſion of Contempt always judges right."</q> Whereas, in Truth, it never <hi>judges</hi> at all; being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excited by Objects real or imaginary that preſent themſelves.</p>
               <p>OBSERVE therefore what a Number of <hi>new</hi> Phraſes and <hi>blind</hi> Guides this of Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, if once admitted, would bring in upon us, and all on equal Authority. For with the ſame Reaſon, as the Paſſion of Contempt is ſtyled the <hi>Senſe of Ridicule,</hi> the Paſſion of <hi>Fear</hi> may be called the <hi>Senſe of Danger,</hi> and <hi>Anger</hi> the <hi>Senſe of Injury.</hi> But who hath ever dreamt of exalting theſe Paſſions into ſo many Teſts of the Reality of their reſpective Objects? The Deſign muſt have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as abſurd, becauſe it is the Province of Reaſon alone, to correct the blind Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of every Paſſion, and fix it on its proper
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1167800100:104"/>
Object. Now, the Scheme of Ridicule is of the ſame Nature. It propoſes the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Contempt as the Teſt of moral Falſehood, which, from the very Terms, appears to be a Project full as wiſe, as to make Fear the Teſt of Danger, or Anger the Teſt of Injury.</p>
               <p>THE Gentleman proceeds next to the Caſe of SOCRATES. He owns <q rend="inline">"the SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRATES of ARISTOPHANES is as truly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous a Character as ever was drawn: But it is not the Character of SOCRATES, the divine Moraliſt and Father of ancient Wiſdom."</q>—No indeed: and here lay the Wickedneſs of the Poet's Intention, and the Danger of his Art: in impoſing Fictions for Realities on the miſled Multitude; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Fool's Coat on the Father of ancient Wiſdom. 'Tis true, the People laughed at the <hi>ridiculous Sophiſt;</hi> but when the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Sophiſt came to drink the Poiſon, what think you became of the Father of ancient Wiſdom?</p>
               <p>BUT then he tells us, that as the comic Poet introduced foreign Circumſtances into the Character of SOCRATES, and built his Ridicule upon theſe; <q rend="inline">"So has the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of SPINOZA made many Atheiſts;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1167800100:105"/>
he has founded it indeed on Suppoſitions utterly falſe, but allow him theſe, and his Concluſions are unavoidably true. And if we muſt reject the Uſe of Ridicule, becauſe, by the Impoſition of falſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, things may be made to ſeem ridiculous, which are not ſo in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; why we ought not to reject the Uſe of Reaſon, becauſe, by proceeding on falſe Principles, Concluſions will appear true which are impoſſible in Nature, let the vehement and obſtinate Declaimers againſt Ridicule determine<note n="i" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Page 106.</bibl>
                     </note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT why ſo much Indignation againſt <hi>Declaimers</hi> in one who writes in Defence of <hi>Ridicule,</hi> a Species of <hi>Declamation?</hi> Then as to <hi>rejecting</hi> the Uſe of Ridicule, a very material Diſtinction is to be made: As a <hi>Mode of Eloquence</hi> nobody attempts totally to reject it, while it remains under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Reaſon: But as a <hi>Teſt of Truth,</hi> I hope the Reader hath ſeen ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon totally to reject it.</p>
               <p>NEITHER will the Parallel by any means hold good, which the Gentleman hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to draw between the Abuſe of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1167800100:106"/>
to which the Way of Ridicule applies, is apt to form to itſelf innumerable fictitious Reſemblances of Things which tend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Truth with Falſehood: Whereas the natural Tendency of Reaſon is to ſeparate theſe apparent Reſemblances, and determine which are the <hi>real,</hi> and which the <hi>fictitious.</hi> Although therefore SPINOZA hath advanced many Falſehoods in the Way of ſpeculative Affirmation, and founded his Reaſonings on theſe, yet ſtill Reaſon will be her own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectreſs, and eaſily diſcover the Cheat. But if the Imagination be impreſſed with falſe Appearances, and the Paſſion of Contempt ſtrongly excited, neither the <hi>Imagination</hi> nor the <hi>Paſſion can ever correct themſelves;</hi> but muſt inevitably be miſled, unleſs <hi>Reaſon</hi> be called in to rectify the Miſtake, and bring back the Paſſion to its proper Channel.</p>
               <p>NAY, ſo far is the Uſe of Ridicule, when prior to rational Conviction, from being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel to Reaſon, or co-operative with it; that, on the contrary, it hath a ſtrong Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to prevent the Efforts of Reaſon, and to confound its Operations. It is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that human Reaſon, though the <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,</hi> is yet in all Caſes an <hi>adequate</hi> Teſt of Truth: It is always fallible, often errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1167800100:107"/>
But it would be much leſs erroneous, were every Mode of Eloquence, and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule above all others, kept remote from its Operations; were no Paſſion ſuffered to blend itſelf with the Reſearches of the Mind. For Ridicule, working on the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Paſſions, diſpoſes the Mind to receive and acquieſce in any Opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its proper Evidence. Hence Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice ariſes; and the Mind, which ſhould be <hi>free</hi> to examine and weigh thoſe <hi>real</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which PROVE SOCRATES to be indeed a divine Philoſopher, is drawn by the <hi>prior</hi> Suggeſtions of <hi>Ridicule</hi> to receive and acquieſce in thoſe falſe Circumſtances, which PAINT him as a <hi>contemptible Sophiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO conclude: 'Tis no difficult Matter to point out the Foundation of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Errors concerning Ridicule. They have ariſen ſolely from his miſtaking <hi>the Paſſion of Contempt</hi> for a <hi>judicial Faculty:</hi> Hence all thoſe new-fangled Expreſſions of—<q rend="inline">"the Faculty of Ridicule"—"the Senſe of Ridicule"—and "the feeling of the Ridiculous:"</q> In the Uſe of which he ſeems to have impoſed upon himſelf new Phraſes for Realities, and Words for Things.

               <p>TO return therefore to the noble Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As it is evident, that <hi>Ridicule</hi> cannot in general without Abſurdity be applied as a Teſt of Truth; ſo can it leaſt of all be

               </p>
               <p>TO illuſtrate this Truth, let us conſider the following Inſtance, which ſeems clear and full to the Point.</p>
               <p>THERE is not perhaps in any Language a bolder or ſtronger Ridicule, than the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Apologue of <hi>The Tale of a Tub.</hi> Its manifeſt Deſign is to recommend the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Church,</hi> and to diſgrace the two Extremes of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Puritaniſm</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <p>Some indeed have pretended otherwiſe. Thus Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> in his <hi>Reflections on Learning,</hi> ſays, <q rend="inline">"It is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Banter upon all that is eſteemed ſacred among Men."</q> And the pious Author of the <hi>Independent Whig</hi> affirms it was <q rend="inline">"the ſole <hi>open</hi> Attack that had been made upon <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſince the Revolution, except the <hi>Oracles of Reaſon,</hi> and was not inferior in Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Malice, to the Attacks of <hi>Celſus,</hi> or <hi>Julian,</hi> or <hi>Porphyry,</hi> or <hi>Lucian.</hi>" p. 399.</q> Where by the Way, the Oddity of the <hi>Contraſt</hi> is remarkable enough; that he ſhould pronounce the <hi>Tale of a Tub</hi> to be a <hi>Libel on Chriſtianity,</hi> while it is in Fact <hi>a Vindication of our Eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhment;</hi> and at the ſame Time entitle his own Book <hi>a Vindication of our Eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> while in Fact it is <hi>a Libel on Chriſtianity.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note>. Now, if we
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1167800100:111"/>
conſider this exquiſite Piece of Raillery as a Teſt of Truth, we ſhall find it impotent and vain: For the Queſtion ſtill recurs, whether MARTIN be a juſt Emblem of the <hi>Engliſh, Jack</hi> of the <hi>Scotch,</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> All the Points in Debate between the ſeveral Parties are taken for granted in the Repreſentation: And we muſt have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>Argument,</hi> and to that alone, ere we can determine the Merits of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>IF we next conſider this Maſter-piece of Wit as a Mode of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> we ſhall find it indeed of great <hi>Efficacy</hi> in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Member of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in his own Communion, and in giving him a thorough Diſtaſte of thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> And ſo far as this may be regarded as a Matter of <hi>public Utility,</hi> ſo far the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule may be laudable.</p>
               <p>BUT if we extend our Views ſo as to comprehend a larger Plan of <hi>moral Uſe;</hi> we ſhall find this Method of Perſuaſion is ſuch, as Charity can hardly approve of: For by repreſenting the one of theſe Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Character of <hi>Craft and Knavery,</hi> the other under that of <hi>incurable Madneſs,</hi> it muſt needs tend to inſpire every Member
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1167800100:112"/>
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church who believes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, with ſuch <hi>Hatred</hi> of the one, and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the other, as to prevent all <hi>friendly Debate</hi> and <hi>rational Remonſtrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ITS effect on thoſe who hold the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of CALVIN, or of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt be yet worſe: Unleſs it can be proved, that the Way to attract the Love, and convince the Reaſon of Mankind, is to ſhew that we hate or deſpiſe them. While they revere what we deride, 'tis plain, we cannot <hi>both</hi> view the Subject in the ſame Light: And though we deride what appears to us <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,</hi> we deride what to them appears <hi>ſacred.</hi> They will therefore accuſe us of miſrepreſenting their Opinions, and abhor us as <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>impious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THUS although this noted Apologue be indeed a Vindication of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, yet it is ſuch as had been better ſpared: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its natural Effect is to create Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and inſpire the contending Parties with mutual Diſtaſte, Contempt, and Hatred.</p>
               <p>BUT if the Way of Ridicule is thus wholly to be rejected in treating every <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted</hi> Subject; it will probably be aſked, <q rend="inline">"Where then is it to be applied? Whether it is reaſonable <hi>to calumniate and blacken</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1167800100:113"/>
                     <hi>it without Diſtinction?</hi> And whether it is not Impiety, thus <hi>to vilify the Gifts of our Maker?</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>AND 'tis certain, that to do this, were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and impious. As on the other hand, there is an equal Abſurdity and Impiety in confounding that Order of Things which the Creator hath eſtabliſhed, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raiſe <hi>a blind Paſſion</hi> into the <hi>Throne of Reaſon.</hi> One Party or other in this Debate hath certainly incurred the Cenſure: The Cenſure is ſevere, and let it fall where it is deſerved. I know none that endeavour to vilify and blacken Ridicule without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, unleſs when it preſumes to elevate itſelf into a <hi>Teſt of Truth:</hi> And then, as a Rebel to the Order and Conſtitution of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it ought to be reſolutely encountered and repelled, till it take Refuge in its own inferior Station.</p>
               <p>THE proper Uſe of Ridicule therefore is, <q rend="inline">"to diſgrace <hi>known</hi> Falſehood:"</q> And thus, negatively at leaſt, <q rend="inline">"to enforce <hi>known</hi> Truth."</q> Yet this can only be affirmed of certain Kinds of Falſehood or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, to which we ſeem to have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated the general Name of <hi>Folly:</hi> And among the ſeveral Branches of this, chiefly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1167800100:114"/>
I think, to AFFECTATION. For as every <hi>Affectation</hi> ariſes from a falſe Pretence to <hi>Praiſe,</hi> ſo a <hi>Contempt incurred</hi> tends to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> the Claimant of his <hi>Error,</hi> and thus becomes the natural Remedy to the Evil.</p>
               <p>MUCH more might be ſaid on this Head. We might run through numerous Diviſions and Subdiviſions of <hi>Folly:</hi> But as the Taſk would be both inſignificant and endleſs, I am unwilling to trouble the Reader with ſuch elaborate Trifles.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems an Obſervation more worthy of our Attention and Regard; that <hi>Contempt,</hi> whence Ridicule ariſes, being a <hi>ſelfiſh Paſſion,</hi> and nearly allied to <hi>Pride,</hi> if not abſolutely founded on it; we ought ever to keep a ſtrict Rein, and in general rather curb than forward its Emotions. Is there a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Maxim in Philoſophy than this, that we ſhould gain a Habit of controuling our Imaginations and Paſſions by the Uſe of Reaſon? Eſpecially thoſe that are rather of the ſelfiſh than the benevolent Kind? That we ſhould not ſuffer our Fears to ſink us in Cowardice, our Joys in Weakneſs, our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Revenge? And ſure there is not a Paſſion that infeſts human Life, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are ſo generally pernicious as thoſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1167800100:115"/>
of <hi>indulged Contempt.</hi> As the common Occurrences of Life are the Objects which afford it Nouriſhment, ſo by this means it is kept more conſtantly in Play, than any other Affection of the Mind: And is indeed the general Inſtrument by which Individuals, Families, Sects, Provinces, and Nations, are driven from a State of mutual Charity, into that of Bitterneſs and Diſſention. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Raillery to Railing; from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to Hatred. Thus if the Love of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule be not in itſelf a Paſſion of the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Species, it leads at leaſt to thoſe which are ſo. Add to this, that the moſt ignorant are generally the moſt contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and they the moſt forward to <hi>deride,</hi> who are moſt incapable or moſt unwilling to <hi>underſtand.</hi> Narrow Conceptions of Things lead to groundleſs Deriſion: And this Spirit of Scorn in its Turn, as it cuts us off from all Information, confirms us in our preconceived and groundleſs Opinions.</p>
               <p>THIS being the real Nature and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Ridicule, it cannot be worth while to deſcant much on its Application, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore its Subſerviency to the Uſes of Liſe. For though under the ſevere Reſtrictions of Reaſon, it may be made a proper Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1167800100:116"/>
on many Occaſions, for diſgracing <hi>known Folly;</hi> yet the Turn of Levity it gives the Mind, the Diſtaſte it raiſes to all candid and rational Information, the Spirit of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity it is apt to excite, the Errors in which it confirms us when its Suggeſtions are falſe, the Extremes to which it is apt to drive us, even when its Suggeſtions are true; all theſe conſpire to tell us, it is rather to be wiſhed than hoped, that its Influence upon the whole can be conſiderable in the Service of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LORD SHAFTESBURY himſelf, in many other Parts of his Book, ſtrongly inſiſts on the Neceſſity of bringing the Imagination and Paſſions under the Dominion of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <q rend="inline">"The only Poiſon to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſays he, is <hi>Paſſion:</hi> For <hi>falſe Reaſoning</hi> is ſoon redreſſed, where Paſſion is removed<note n="n" place="bottom">

               <p>HAVING conſidered the noble Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's two firſt Treatiſes, ſo far as they regard the <hi>Uſe of Ridicule,</hi> we now come to his <hi>Soliloquy,</hi> or <hi>Advice to an Author.</hi> And here, bating only a few accidental Paſſages, which will be occaſionally pointed out here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, we ſhall have little more to do, than to approve and admire: The whole Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation being, in its general Turn, one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1167800100:119"/>
Inſtance of its Author's Knowledge and refined Taſte in Books, Life, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. I could dwell with Pleaſure on the Beauties of this Work, if indeed they needed an Explanation: But that noble Union of Truth and Eloquence which ſhines through the whole, as it ſuperſedes, ſo it would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace any Attempt of this Kind. To the Work itſelf therefore I recommend the Reader.</p>
               <p>THE noble Writer having thus prepared us for the Depths of Philoſophy, by enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unfeigned and rigorous <hi>Self-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> proceeds to that higheſt and moſt intereſting of all Subjects, <hi>The Obligations of Man to the Practice of Virtue.</hi> And here it will probably appear, that with a Variety of uſeful Truths, he hath blended ſeveral plauſible Miſtakes, which, when more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viewed, ſeem to be attended with a Train of very extraordinary Conſequences. What he hath given us on this Subject, lies chiefly in the two Treatiſes, which compoſe his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume: But as he frequently refers us to the other Parts of his Writings, where he hath accidentally treated the ſame Points in a more explicit Manner; ſo the ſame Liberty of comparing one Paſſage with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1167800100:120"/>
will, I apprehend, be judged reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the candid Reader.

The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument hath been handled by ſeveral of great Name: And it might poſſibly be deemed Preſumption to differ from any of them, had they not ſo widely differed among themſelves. Much hath been ſaid, and various have been their Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our <hi>Obligations</hi> to <hi>Virtue;</hi> but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hath been ſaid in any definitive Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, on the previous and fundamental Queſtion, <hi>What Virtue is.</hi> By which I do not mean, what Actions are called Virtuous, for, about that, Mankind are pretty well agreed, but, <hi>what makes Virtue to be what it is.</hi> And till we have determined this with all poſſible Preciſion, we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <q rend="inline">"upon what Foundation Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1167800100:122"/>
are obliged to the Practice of it."</q> Our firſt Enquiry therefore muſt be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Virtue:</hi> In the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of which, the Moraliſts of moſt Ages ſeem to have been remarkably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
               <p>LET us firſt conſider what our noble Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath ſaid on this Subject. He tells us, <q rend="inline">"The Mind cannot be without its Eye and Ear; ſo as to diſcern Proportion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh Sound, and ſcan each Sentiment and Thought which comes before it.

               <p>THE next Writer I ſhall mention is the learned and amiable Dr. CLARKE.

That from theſe, which are neceſſarily perceived by every rational Agent, there naturally ariſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>moral Obligations,</hi> which are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves incumbent on all, antecedent to all poſitive Inſtitution, and to all Expectation of Reward or Puniſhment<note n="r" place="bottom">

AFTER theſe, comes an ingenious and candid Writer, and in Oppoſition to both theſe Schemes of Moral, fixes the Nature of Virtue in <q rend="inline">"a Conformity of our Actions with <hi>Truth.</hi>"</q> He affirms, that <q rend="inline">"no Act, whether Word or Deed, of any Being, to whom moral Good and Evil are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, that interferes with any <hi>true</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or <hi>denies</hi> any thing to be as it is, can be <hi>right.</hi> That, on the contrary, every Act is right which does not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict Truth, but treats every thing as being what it is<note n="s" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>There are, beſides theſe, ſeveral other philoſophical Opinions concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Virtue: as, that it conſiſts in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Nature</hi>—in avoiding all <hi>Extremes</hi>—in the Imitation of the <hi>Deity.</hi> But theſe are ſtill more looſe and indeterminate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, if poſſible, than the former.

each other, are equally defective; <q rend="inline">"Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not give us any more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or determinate Ideas, than what we have from that <hi>ſingle Word,</hi> which with ſo much fruitleſs Labour they attempt to define."</q>
               </p>
               <p>LET us firſt examine the noble Writer's Definition in this View. He ſays, that <q rend="inline">"Virtue conſiſts in a Conformity of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections with our natural Senſe of the Sublime and Beautiful in Things, or with the moral Objects of Right and Wrong."</q>—Now, what new Idea do we gain from this pompous Definition? Have we not the ſame general Idea from the Word <hi>Virtue,</hi> as from the more diffuſed Expreſſion of <hi>the Sublime and Beautiful of Things?</hi> And can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not we gather as much from either of theſe, as from the ſubſequent Phraſe, the <hi>moral Objects of Right and Wrong?</hi>"—They are all general Names, relative to ſomething which is yet unknown, and which is no more explained by the pretended Definition, than by the Word which is attempted to be defined. Indeed, when his Lordſhip further affirms, that to relieve the Needy, or help the Friendleſs, is an Inſtance of this Sublime and Beautiful of Things, we then
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1167800100:126"/>
obtain a more determinate Idea, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that particular Caſe. But ſtill we are as much as ever at a Loſs for a general <hi>Criterion</hi> or <hi>Teſt,</hi> by which the Virtue of our other Actions is to be determined. To ſay, therefore, that Virtue conſiſts in acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>fair,</hi> the <hi>handſome,</hi> the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,</hi> the <hi>beautiful,</hi> the <hi>decent,</hi> the <hi>moral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> is really no more than ringing Changes upon Words. We might with equal Propriety affirm, <q rend="inline">"that <hi>Virtue</hi> conſiſts in <hi>acting virtuouſly.</hi>"</q> This Deficiency Mr. WOLLASTON clearly ſaw. <q rend="inline">"They, ſays he, who reckon nothing to be <hi>(morally)</hi> good, but what they call <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtum,</hi> may denominate Actions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as that is, or is not the Cauſe or End of them: But then, what is <hi>honeſtum?</hi> Something is ſtill wanting to meaſure Things by, and to ſeparate the <hi>honeſta</hi> from the <hi>inhoneſta</hi>

               <p>DR. CLARKE's Definition ſeems not to include any thing more preciſe or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, than the noble Writer's.

                  <hi>Beautiful</hi> give us no more determinate Ideas, than the <hi>Virtuous,</hi> ſo neither can we obtain any additional Information from the <hi>Fit</hi> and <hi>Reaſonable.</hi> We are equally at a Loſs to know what is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reaſonable,</hi> as to know what is <hi>virtuous:</hi> Therefore the <hi>one</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be an adequate Definition of the other.

THUS it ſhould ſeem, that our three ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Writers have not given the Satif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which might have been expected in an Affair of ſuch philoſophical Importance.

               </p>
               <p>THE firſt Proofs in Support of this Opinion ſhall be drawn from thoſe very Writers who moſt zealouſly oppoſe it.

MR.

Becauſe this is to treat it as being what it is not. And why ſhould not the converſe be reckoned as bad; that is, to treat a Man as a Poſt?

                     </note>."</q> Now, you ſee that on his Scheme of abſolute irrelative Truth, the Abſurdity of <hi>talking to a Poſt</hi> is preciſely of the ſame Nature with that of <hi>injuring a Man:</hi> For in both Caſes, we treat the Poſt and the Man, as being <hi>what they are not.</hi> Conſequently, on this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, if it be morally Evil to <hi>injure a Man,</hi> 'tis likewiſe morally Evil to <hi>talk</hi> to a <hi>Poſt.</hi> Not that I ſuppoſe Mr. WOLLASTON would have maintained this Conſequence. He knew that the Firſt of theſe Abſurdities would only deſerve the Name of <hi>Folly;</hi> that the latter, of a <hi>Crime.</hi> As therefore he allows that Truth is equally violated in either Caſe; as there is ſomething <hi>highly</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:1167800100:135"/>
                  <hi>immoral</hi> in the one, and <hi>nothing immoral</hi> in the other, here is an Exception which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns his Principle: which proves that the Morality or Immorality of Actions depends on ſomething <hi>diſtinct</hi> from mere abſtract, irrelative <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſame Exception muſt be admitted on Dr. CLARKE's Syſtem of Expreſſion. For ſure, 'tis neither <hi>fit</hi> nor <hi>reaſonable,</hi> nor agreeable to the Relations of Things, that a Man ſhould talk to a Poſt. Yet, although it be admitted as <hi>irrational</hi> and <hi>abſurd,</hi> I do not imagine, any of Dr. CLARKE's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders would ſay it was <hi>immoral.</hi> So again, with regard to Lord SHAFTESBURY, 'tis clear there can be nothing of the <hi>Sublime</hi> or <hi>Beautiful</hi> in this Action of talking to a Poſt: On the contrary, there is (to uſe his own Manner of Expreſſion) an apparent Indecency, Impropriety, and <hi>Diſſonance</hi> in it. Yet, although his Admirers might juſtly denominate it <hi>incongruous,</hi> they would ſurely be far from branding it as <hi>vile.</hi> Here then the ſame Exception again takes place, which demonſtrates that <hi>Virtue</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt either in <hi>abſtract Fitneſs</hi> or <hi>Beauty;</hi> but that ſomething further is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in order to conſtitute its Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1167800100:136"/>
POSSIBLY therefore, the Patrons of theſe ſeveral Theories may alledge, that Actions which relate to <hi>inanimate Beings</hi> only, can properly be called no more than <hi>naturally</hi> beautiful, fit, or true: But that <hi>moral</hi> Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Beauty, or Truth, can only ariſe from ſuch Actions as relate to Beings that are <hi>ſenſible</hi> or <hi>intelligent.</hi> Mr. BALGUY ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly makes this Exception: He affirms, that <q rend="inline">"moral Actions are ſuch as are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly directed towards ſome Object intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent or ſenſible<note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>

               </p>
               <p>AND ſo far indeed this Refinement ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches towards the Truth, as it excludes all <hi>inanimate</hi> Things from being the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of moral Good and Evil. Yet even this Idea of moral Beauty, Fitneſs, or Truth, is highly indeterminate and defective: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe innumerable Inſtances may be given, of Actions directed towards Objects ſenſible and intelligent, ſome of which Actions are manifeſtly <hi>becoming, fit,</hi> or <hi>true,</hi> others as manifeſtly <hi>incongruous, irrational,</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> yet none of them, in any Degree, <hi>virtuous</hi> or <hi>vicious, meritorious</hi> or <hi>immoral.</hi> Thus to ſpeak to a Man in a Language he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, is an Action <hi>becoming, fit,</hi> or <hi>true;</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:1167800100:137"/>
'tis treating him according to the Order, Relations, and Truth of Things; 'tis treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him according to <hi>what he is.</hi> On the contrary, to ſpeak to him in a Language he underſtands not, is an Action neither <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, fit,</hi> nor <hi>true;</hi> 'tis treating him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>what he is not;</hi> 'tis treating him <hi>as a Poſt.</hi> But although the firſt of theſe Actions be undeniably becoming, fit, or true, who will call it <hi>Virtue?</hi> And though the latter be undeniably incongruous, irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and falſe, who will call it <hi>Vice?</hi> Yet both theſe Actions are directed towards a Being that is ſenſible and intelligent. It follows therefore, that an Action is not either morally Good or Evil, merely becauſe it is conformable to the Beauty, Fitneſs, or Truth of Things, even though it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards an Object both <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>intelligent;</hi> but that ſomething ſtill further, ſome more diſtinguiſhing and characteriſtic Circumſtance is neceſſary, in order to fix its real Eſſence.</p>
               <p>WHAT this peculiar Circumſtance may be, we come now to enquire. And the firſt Lights in this Enquiry ſhall be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from theſe very celebrated Writers, whom we have here ventured to oppoſe.

For ſuch is the Force and Energy of Truth, that while they are attempting to involve her in a Cloud of Metaphyſics, ſhe breaks through the myſtic Veil they had prepared and woven for her with ſo much Art, and diffuſeth a Stream of genuine Luſtre, which the moſt obdurate Prejudice can only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by winking hard.</p>
               <p>AND firſt, though the <hi>noble</hi> Writer every where attempts to fix an original, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, moral Beauty of Action, to which every thing is to be referred, and which it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is not to be referred to any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="c" place="bottom">

               <p>MR. WOLLASTON is no leſs explicit in this particular: For in every Inſtance he brings, <hi>the Happineſs</hi> of Man is the ſingle End to which his Rule of Truth verges in an unvaried Manner. Thus in the Paſſage

already cited, though he conſiders the <hi>talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Poſt</hi> as an <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> he is far from condemning it as an <hi>immoral</hi> Action: But in the ſame Paragraph, when he comes to give an Inſtance of the Violation of <hi>moral</hi> Truth, he immediately has recourſe to <hi>Man;</hi> and not only ſo, but to the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Man. <q rend="inline">"Why, ſaith he, ſhould not the Converſe be reckoned as bad; that is, to treat a <hi>Man</hi> as a Poſt; as if he had no <hi>Senſe,</hi> and <hi>felt</hi> not <hi>Injuries,</hi> which he doth <hi>feel;</hi> as if to him <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> were not <hi>Pain; Happineſs</hi> not <hi>Happineſs.</hi>"</q> At other Times he affirms, that <q rend="inline">"the <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of the Truths on the one and the other Side ſhould be diligently <hi>compared</hi>

               <p>AS therefore theſe celebrated Writers give no Inſtances of moral Beauty, Fitneſs, or Truth, but what finally relate to the Happineſs of Man; ſo if we appeal to the common Senſe of Mankind, we ſhall ſee that the Idea of Virtue hath never been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally affixed to any Action or Affection of the Mind, unleſs where this Tendency to produce Happineſs was at leaſt <hi>apparent.</hi> What are all the Black Catalogues of Vice or moral Turpitude, which we read in Hiſtory, or find in the Circle of our own Experience, what are they but ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>Miſery produced?</hi> And what are the fair and amiable Atchievements of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators, Patriots,</hi> and <hi>Sages</hi> renowned in Story, what but ſo many Efforts to raiſe Mankind from Miſery, and eſtabliſh the public Happineſs on a ſure Foundation?

The firſt are <hi>vicious, immoral, deformed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there we ſee Mankind <hi>afflicted</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:</hi> The latter are <hi>virtuous, right, beautiful,</hi> becauſe here we ſee Mankind <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> and <hi>aſſiſted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT that <hi>Happineſs</hi> is the laſt Criterion or Teſt, to which the moral Beauty, Truth, or Rectitude of our Affections is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, the two following Circumſtances <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate:</hi> Firſt, <q rend="inline">"thoſe very Affections and Actions, which, in the ordinary Courſe of Things, are approved as virtuous, do change their Nature, and become vicious in the ſtricteſt Senſe, when they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this fundamental Law, of the greateſt public Happineſs."</q> Thus, although in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral it is a Parent's Duty to prefer a Child's Welfare, to that of another Perſon, yet, if this natural and juſt Affection gain ſuch Strength, as to tempt the Parent to violate the <hi>Public</hi> for his Child's <hi>particular</hi> Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; what was before a <hi>Duty,</hi> by this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes immoderate and <hi>criminal.</hi> This the noble Writer hath allowed: <q rend="inline">"If Kindneſs or Love of the moſt natural Sort be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate,</hi> it is undoubtly <hi>vicious</hi>

               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY, with ſuch uncontrouled Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority does this great Principle command us; that <q rend="inline">"Actions which are in their own Nature, moſt ſhocking to every <hi>humane</hi> Affection loſe at once their moral Deſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, when they become ſubſervient to the general Welfare; and aſſume both the Name and the Nature of Virtue."</q> For what is more contrary to every gentle and kind Affection that dwells in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Breaſt, than to ſhed the Blood, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Life of Man? Yet the ruling Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple above-mentioned, can reconcile us
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1167800100:145"/>
even to <hi>this.</hi> And when the Neceſſity of public Example compels us to make a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of this Kind; though we may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Occaſion,</hi> we cannot condemn the <hi>Fact:</hi> So far are we from branding it as <hi>Murder,</hi> that we approve it as <hi>Juſtice:</hi> and always defend it on this great Principle alone, <hi>that it was neceſſary for the public Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THUS it appears, that thoſe Actions which we denominate Virtuous, Beautiful, Fit, or True, have not any abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, but a relative and reflected Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And that their Tendency to produce Happineſs is the only Source from whence they derive their Luſtre.

               <p>BUT when the great End of public Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is ultimately referred to, as the <hi>one,</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:1167800100:150"/>
                  <hi>uniform</hi> Circumſtance that conſtitutes the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of human Actions; then indeed, <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> aſſume a more <hi>real</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent</hi> Nature: The common <hi>Senſe,</hi> nay, the very <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of Mankind, will urge them to make an unvaried and juſt <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction:</hi> For <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> make too ſtrong an Appeal to all the Faculties of Man, to be borne down by the <hi>Caprice</hi> of Fancy and Opinion. That it was either an accidental or a deſigned Inattention to this great Principle of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> that gave this coarſe Writer an Occaſion to call in Queſtion the permanent <hi>Reality</hi> of Vice and Virtue, the following Conſiderations may ſufficiently convince us.</p>
               <p>SHOULD any one aſk, whether <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs</hi> are two different Things, no Doubt we ſhould anſwer in the Affirmative: And would ſurely ſuſpect any Man's Sincerity, who ſhould tell us, that what was accounted Health in one Age or Nation, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Sickneſs in another. There are likewiſe ſuch Things as wholeſome Food and Poiſons: Nor would we entertain a much better Opinion of him who ſhould affirm, that <hi>all</hi> depends upon <hi>Fancy;</hi> that <hi>Bread</hi> or <hi>Milk</hi> are nouriſhing or deſtructive,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1167800100:151"/>
that <hi>Arſenic</hi> and <hi>Sublimate</hi> are wholeſome or poiſonous, as <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Opinion</hi> dictate. On the contrary we know, their Nature with Reſpect to Man, is <hi>invariable:</hi> The one, univerſally wholeſome, the other, poiſonous. Further: we know there have been Debates among Phyſicians, about <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen</hi> and <hi>Diet:</hi> That ſome have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Wholeſomeneſs of <hi>Animal,</hi> others of <hi>vegetable</hi> Food: Some recommended the Drinking of <hi>Water,</hi> others of <hi>Wine.</hi> Yet none was ever ſo weak as to conclude from theſe different Opinions about wholeſome <hi>Diet,</hi> that the nouriſhing Qualities of <hi>Bread,</hi> or the noxious ones of <hi>Arſenic,</hi> were not <hi>permanent</hi> Realities with regard to Man; or, that the firſt could be made <hi>poiſonous,</hi> the latter, <hi>wholeſome,</hi> by Dint of <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW, the Caſe we are debating is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parallel. For ſure, the <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> of Mankind are Things as diſtinct as <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs:</hi> Whence it follows, that certain Actions, under the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, muſt univerſally produce Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery, as naturally as Food pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Health, or Poiſon, Sickneſs, and Death. We have already ſeen, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1167800100:152"/>
tends to the Good of all, is by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all, denominated <hi>Virtue;</hi> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contrary to this great End, is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally branded as <hi>Vice;</hi> in the ſame Manner, as whatever nouriſhes the Body is called <hi>Food;</hi> whatever deſtroys it, <hi>Poiſon.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, we find the Agreement among Mankind as uniform on the one Subject, as on the other. All Ages and Nations having without Exception or Variance maintained, that Humanity, Fidelity, Truth, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and mutual Benevolence, do as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally produce Happineſs, as Food gives Health to the Body: That Cruelty, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, Lying, Intemperance, Inhumanity, Adultery, Murder, do as naturally give Riſe to Miſery, as Poiſon brings on Sickneſs and Death.</p>
               <p>BUT hath not this Author given ſuch Inſtances as prove, that what is deteſted as <hi>Vice</hi> in one Country, is applauded as <hi>Virtue</hi> in another? That <hi>Polygamy</hi> and <hi>inceſtuous Marriages</hi> have been in ſome Nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>lawful,</hi> in others <hi>meritorious?</hi> And if one Virtue or Vice be imaginary or <hi>variable,</hi> doth it not clearly follow that <hi>all</hi> are ſo?</p>
               <p>NOW a Man of a common Turn of Thought would be apt to make a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

For, to reſume our Illuſtration, as the various Opinions concerning the ſuperior Wholeſomeneſs of this or that kind of <hi>Diet,</hi> does not change the Nature of <hi>Bread</hi> or <hi>Poiſon;</hi> ſo neither can the various Opinions concerning <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy</hi> or <hi>Inceſt,</hi> affect or change the Nature of <hi>Benevolence</hi> and <hi>Generoſity, Adultery</hi> and <hi>Murder.</hi> 'Tis plain, theſe various Opinions have been formed <q rend="inline">"upon ſuch Actions only, as are not univerſally and clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the Happineſs or Miſery of Mankind."</q> As theſe Actions have been deemed productive of the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> they have been regarded as <hi>Virtues</hi> or <hi>Vices:</hi> But this Variety of Opinions does no

more unſettle the Nature of thoſe Actions, whoſe <hi>Tendency</hi> is clear and <hi>certain;</hi> than the Debates on the ſuperior Wholeſomeneſs of animal or vegetable <hi>Diet</hi> can change the Nature of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Poiſon.</hi> Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Virtue and Vice are permanent Realities, and that their Nature is fixed, certain, and <hi>invariable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THUS one Extreme produceth another. For the noble Writer and this Gentleman, through a ſtrong Diſlike of each other's Syſtems, have <hi>both</hi> endeavoured to prove <hi>too much,</hi> and in Conſequence have proved <hi>nothing.</hi> The one, contending for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent <hi>Reality</hi> of Virtue, and, not content to fix it on its proper Baſis, attempts to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh certain <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>immutable</hi> Forms of Beauty, without Regard to any <hi>further End;</hi> and thus, by laying a chimerical Foundation, <hi>betrays</hi> the Cauſe which he ſo generouſly defends. The other, intent on deſtroying the permanent Reality of Virtue and Vice, and perceiving how weak a Baſis the noble Writer had laid for their Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, after proving <hi>this</hi> to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as wiſely as honeſtly infers, there is no real one in Nature.

one Part, <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> are Things merely <hi>relative</hi> to the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Man; ſo on the other, while Man continues what he is, all thoſe <hi>Relations</hi> which concern his <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and ariſe from his preſent Manner of Exiſtence, are likewiſe <hi>permanent</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable.</hi>

               <p>BUT this idle Objection againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent <hi>Reality</hi> of Virtue and Vice, is not the only one which the Writer laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned hath laboured, for the Deſtruction of Religion and Virtue. For the main Drift and Intention of his Book is to prove no leſs a Paradox than this, that <q rend="inline">"private Vices are public Benefits."</q> Now, till this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection be removed, our Idea and Definition of Virtue can never be thoroughly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.

               </p>
               <p>NOW, the firſt notable Circumſtance in this formidable Aſſertion of Dr. MANDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILLE, is its utter Inconſiſtency with all that he hath advanced in order to deſtroy the Reality of Vice and Virtue. For if indeed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1167800100:156"/>
theſe be mere <hi>Names,</hi> the Creatures of Fancy and Opinion, how can they be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any <hi>uniform</hi> Effects? How can they be either public <hi>Benefits,</hi> or public <hi>Evils?</hi>—If on the contrary, they really produce certain uniform Effects, as he hath attempted to prove, how can they be mere <hi>Non-Entities,</hi> the Creatures of Fancy and Opinion? Here lies a groſs and palpable Incoherence: Take which of his two Theories you pleaſe, the other abſolutely deſtroys it. If Vice be a public <hi>Benefit,</hi> it muſt be a permanent <hi>Reality:</hi> If it is not a permanent <hi>Reality,</hi> it cannot be a public <hi>Benefit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us now examine the Foundations on which he hath built this ſtrange Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis. His Book may be analyſed into four different Principles, which he hath variouſly combined, or rather jumbled together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as each in their Turn would beſt ſerve his Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Principle he lays down, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes up, <hi>i. e.</hi> for granted, is, <q rend="inline">"that Man is a compound of evil Paſſions:"</q> In other Words, <q rend="inline">"that the Gratiſication of the natural Appetites is in itſelf a Vice."</q> There are in his Book, at leaſt a hundred
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1167800100:157"/>
Pages of the loweſt common-place Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, all founded on this one Principle, brought from the <hi>ſolitary Caves</hi> and <hi>Viſions</hi> of the <hi>Deſart.</hi> Thus the Deſire of being eſteemed by others, he ſtigmatizes with the Name of <hi>Pride:</hi> The natural Deſire of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Converſe between the two Sexes, he diſtinguiſheth by a <hi>groſſer</hi> Appellation. In a word, through the whole Courſe of his Argument, he <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> that every <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite (that is, every Appetite which hath regard to <hi>ourſelf</hi>) is in its own Nature vile and abominable. This the candid Reader will probably think a little hard upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature: That no Man can be <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> while he endeavours to be <hi>eſteemed,</hi> while he loves to quench his Thirſt, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to Poſterity, or eat his Dinner. On the Weight of theſe plain Inſtances, the Value of this firſt Principle may be ſafely left to any Man's impartial Trial.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus branded every Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the natural Appetites; he gains from hence a proper Foundation for the ſecond <hi>Pillar</hi> of this <hi>Temple</hi> of Vice. For he acquaints us with great Solemnity, that, of all other Vices, that of <hi>Luxury</hi> is moſt beneficial to a State: And that if this were

               </p>
               <p>THUS, when he affirms that Luxury pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth public Happineſs, we ſtand ready for ſome deep and ſubtile Speculation, to ſupport ſo wondrous a Paradox. But when he poorly tells us, <q rend="inline">"that every thing is

               <p>HERE then he enumerates ſeveral real Crimes, which are <hi>neceſſarily</hi> attended with <hi>great Evils;</hi> and theſe he demonſtrates, are <hi>accidentally</hi> productive of <hi>ſome Good.</hi> And this indeed is the only Part of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is attended with any Degree of Plauſibility: For here, it muſt be owned, there is Room for a diſhoneſt Mind to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,</hi> though by no Means to <hi>convince</hi> an impartial Reader. Becauſe the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of theſe Crimes being of a various and <hi>diſcordant</hi> Nature, ſome having the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Good,</hi> and others of <hi>Ill</hi> to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; a <hi>rhetorical</hi> Diſplay of the <hi>former</hi> may poſſibly induce a ſuperficial Enquirer, who is caught by a Glare of Eloquence, to doubt whether <hi>theſe</hi> do not really <hi>predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi> But a moderate Share of Attention
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1167800100:163"/>
will convince us, that this is impoſſible. Becauſe all the real Vices he mentions, though they be accidentally productive of ſome Good; yet 'tis ſuch as might effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be obtained without them. Thus the Money taken wrongfully by Stealth or Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, is only of Service to the Public by its Circulation: But Money may circulate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Stealth or Robbery; and therefore 'tis neither the Stealth nor Robbery that is of Service to the Public. On the other part, there are great and ſubſtantial Evils, which theſe Crimes, and theſe alone give Riſe to. On this Occaſion one might be very large on the Terrors and Diſtreſs, the Murders, and conſequent Miſeries, which the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies patronized by this Writer do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily produce.

DOUBTLESS, the noble Writer's Admirers will deſpiſe and reject this, as an unworthy Maxim.

               <p>NOW ere we proceed further, it may be neceſſary to remark, that in ſome Degree there hath been a <hi>Strife about Words</hi> in this particular too.

               <p>ANOTHER Source of mutual Miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion on this Subject hath been <q rend="inline">"the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction

It tends to miſlead us both with regard to the Nature of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and our Obligations to the Practice of it. For firſt, it induceth a Perſuaſion, that Virtue is <hi>excellent</hi> without Regard to any of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1167800100:172"/>
its Conſequences: And ſecondly, that he muſt either want Eyes, or common Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who doth not at firſt Sight fall in Love with this <hi>matchleſs Lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEREFORE ſetting aſide, as much as may be, all ambiguous Expreſſions, it ſeems evident, that <q rend="inline">"a Motive, from its very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt be ſomething that affects <hi>our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>"</q> If any Man hath found out a Kind of Motive which doth not affect <hi>himſelf,</hi> he hath made a deeper Inveſtigation into the <q rend="inline">"Springs, Weights, and Balances"</q> of the human Heart, than I can pretend to. Now what can poſſibly affect <hi>ourſelf,</hi> or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us to Action, but either the Feeling or Proſpect of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Pain, Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Miſery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT to come to the direct Proof: 'Tis evident, even to Demonſtration, that no <hi>Affection</hi> can, in the ſtrict Senſe, be more or leſs <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> or <hi>diſintereſted</hi> than another; becauſe, <hi>whatever</hi> be its <hi>Object,</hi> the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> itſelf is <hi>ſtill</hi> no other than a <hi>Mode</hi> either of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or of <hi>Pain;</hi> and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>equally</hi> to be referred to the <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Feeling</hi> of the <hi>Patient,</hi> whatever be its <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Occaſion.</hi> Indeed, a late Writer of Subtilty and Refinement hath attempted to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1167800100:173"/>
make a Diſtinction here.

But the Fallacy of this is obvious. The virtuous Sentiment or Paſſion <hi>produces</hi> the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and does not <hi>ariſe</hi> from it.

For in Fact, neither the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> nor the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> are either the <hi>Cauſe</hi> or the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of each other; they neither <hi>produce</hi> nor <hi>ariſe</hi> from each other; becauſe, in Reality, they are the <hi>ſame Thing</hi> under <hi>different Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</hi> This will be clear, if we ſtate the Caſe as follows: <q rend="inline">"To <hi>love</hi> my Friend, is to <hi>feel</hi> a <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in <hi>doing him Good:</hi>"</q> And converſely; <q rend="inline">"to feel a <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in <hi>doing Good</hi> to my Friend, is to <hi>love him.</hi>"</q> Where 'tis plain that the <hi>Terms</hi> are <hi>ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</hi> The <hi>Pleaſure</hi> therefore is the very <hi>Paſſion itſelf;</hi> and neither <hi>prior</hi> nor <hi>poſterior</hi> to it, as this Gentleman ſuppoſeth.</p>

AGAIN, that the Pleaſures ariſing from Benevolence, and the moral Senſe, are ſtrictly <hi>Selfiſh,</hi> in this Senſe of the Word, like every other Enjoyment, ſeems evident from ſome parallel Conceſſions of the noble Writer. For theſe ſeemingly diſintereſted Pleaſures he perpetually ſets on a Level with the Perceptions of natural Beauty, Order, Harmony, and Proportion.

as a <hi>diſtinct End.</hi> Whereas in the Paſſions called <hi>Selfiſh,</hi> the Happineſs ſought after is often <hi>unattainable,</hi> and therefore eaſily and neceſſarily diſtinguiſhed by the Imagination as a <hi>poſitive End.</hi> This Circumſtance of Union however, as is judiciouſly remarked by one of the noble Writer's Followers<note n="o" place="bottom">

               <p>NOW this Concluſion will carry us to another Queſtion of a very intereſting and abſtruſe Nature: That is, <q rend="inline">"How far, and upon what Foundation, the uniform Practice of Virtue, is <hi>really</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> connected with the Happineſs of every Individual?"</q> For ſo far, as we have ſeen, and no further, can every Individual be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally moved or obliged to the Practice of it.</p>
               <p>THIS is evidently a Queſtion of <hi>Fact:</hi> And as it relates to the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> can only be determined by appealing to his <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> If <hi>this</hi> be indeed <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>invariable;</hi> that is, if every Individual hath the ſame Perceptions, Paſſions, and Deſires; then indeed the Sources of Happineſs muſt be <hi>ſimilar</hi> and <hi>unchangeable.</hi> If, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, different Men be differently conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; if they have <hi>different</hi> Perceptions, Paſſions, and Deſires; then muſt the Sources of their Happineſs be equally <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſhould ſeem therefore, that <q rend="inline">"while Moraliſts have been enquiring into hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Happineſs, they have generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1167800100:178"/>
it, as ariſing from one <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> Source, inſtead of tracing it up to thoſe various Fountains whence it really ſprings; which are indefinitely various, combined, and indeterminable."</q> And this ſeems to have been the moſt general Foundation of Error.</p>
               <p>IF we ſpeak with Preciſion, there are but three Sources in Man, of Pleaſure and Pain, Happineſs and Miſery: Theſe are <hi>Senſe, Imagination,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſions.</hi> Now the ſlighteſt Obſervation will convince us, that theſe are aſſociated, ſeparated and combined in Man, with a Variety almoſt infinite. In ſome, the Pleaſures and Pains of <hi>Senſe</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate; Imagination is dull; the Paſſions inactive. In others, a more delicate Frame awakens all the Powers of Imagination; the Paſſions are refined; the Senſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded. A third Conſtitution is carried away by the Strength of Paſſion: The Calls of Senſe are contemned; and Imagination becomes no more than the neceſſary Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome further Gratification.</p>
               <p>From overlooking this plain Fact, ſeems to have ariſen the Diſcordance among Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers concerning the Happineſs of Man. And while <hi>each</hi> hath attempted to exhibit
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1167800100:179"/>
one favourite Picture, as the <hi>Paragon</hi> or <hi>Standard</hi> of human Kind; they have <hi>all</hi> omitted ſome Ten thouſand other Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances which actually ſubſiſt in Nature.</p>
               <p>THUS, moſt of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Sect, tho' not the Founder of it, have diſcarded <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> from their Syſtem of <hi>private</hi> Happineſs. The modern Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizers of this Scheme, Mr. HOBBES, Dr. MANDEVILLE, and ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Writers, after heaping up a Collection of ſordid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which prove the <hi>ſenſual</hi> Inclinations and <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> of Man, leap at once to their deſired Concluſion, that the pretended pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Affections are therefore no more than the ſame low Paſſions in Diſguiſe. That <hi>Benevolence</hi> makes no Part of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that the human Kind are abſolutely unconnected with each other in Point of Affection: And that every Individual <hi>ſeeks</hi> and <hi>finds</hi> his <hi>private</hi> Happineſs in and <hi>from himſelf alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE noble Writer, on the contrary, viewing the brighter Parts of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, through the amiable Medium of the <hi>Socratic</hi> Philoſophy; and fixing his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the <hi>public Affections,</hi> as the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of public and private Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;

rejects the <hi>Epicurean's</hi> Pretences with Diſdain: And fully conſcious of the high Claims and Energy of Virtue, affirms that the <hi>private Affections</hi> are, by no means, a Foundation for <hi>private Happineſs:</hi> That, on the contrary, we muſt univerſally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Welfare of others, if we would effectually ſecure our own: And that in every Caſe, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Virtue</hi> is the <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> the <hi>Ill</hi> of every one<note n="q" place="bottom">

The <hi>Stoic</hi> Party dwell alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the <hi>ſocial</hi> or <hi>public,</hi> the <hi>Epicurean</hi> no leſs on the <hi>private</hi> or <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Affections: On theſe reſpectively they declaim; ſo that according to the one, Mankind are naturally a Race of <hi>Demi-Gods;</hi> according to the other, a Crew of <hi>Devils. Both</hi> forgetting,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1167800100:181"/>
what is unqueſtionably the Truth, that theſe <hi>ſocial</hi> and <hi>private</hi> Affections are blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an endleſs Variety of Degrees, and thus form an infinite Variety of Inclinations and of Characters. Many of the particular Facts, therefore, which theſe two Sects al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are true: But the <hi>general</hi> Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they draw from theſe <hi>particular</hi> Facts, is groundleſs and imaginary. Thus, 'tis true, that Mankind reap high Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Senſes, Imagination, and Paſſions, without any regard to the public Affections: But the Conſequence which the <hi>Epicurean</hi> would draw from hence, that <q rend="inline">"therefore the public Affections are never, in any Caſe, a Source of private Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;"</q> this is entirely void of Evidence: It ſuppoſeth Mankind to be <hi>one uniform</hi> Subject, while it is a Subject infinitely <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;</hi> that every Individual has the ſame Feelings, Appetites, Fancies, and Affections, while, in Fact, they are mixed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in an endleſs Variety of Degrees. So, on the contrary, it muſt appear to every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Obſerver, that <q rend="inline">"the Exerciſe of the public Affections is a Source of the higheſt Gratification to many Individuals."</q> But the <hi>Stoic's</hi> Concluſion, that <q rend="inline">"therefore the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1167800100:182"/>
uniform Exerciſe of the public Affections, in Preference to every other, is the only Source of Happineſs to every Individual;"</q> this is a Concluſion equally void of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For, like its oppoſite Extreme, it ſuppoſeth Mankind to be one uniform Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, while, in Fact, it is a Subject indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely various. It ſuppoſes that every Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual has the ſame Feelings, Appetites, Fancies, and Affections, while, in Reality, they are mixed and combined in an endleſs Variety of Degrees.</p>
               <p>LET us now aſſign the moſt probable Foundation, on which theſe <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>partial</hi> Syſtems have been ſo commonly embraced. For, that two Theories ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, and ſo devoid of all rational Support, ſhould have made their Way in the World, without ſome <hi>permanent</hi> Cauſe beyond the Inſtability of mere <hi>Chance,</hi> ſeems hardly credible.</p>
               <p>IT ſhould ſeem therefore, that <q rend="inline">"while the Patronizers of theſe two Syſtems have attempted to give a general Picture of the human Species, they have all along taken the Copy from themſelves: And thus their Philoſophy, inſtead of being a true Hiſtory of Nature, is no more than the

of theſe two Syſtems inliſt themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſecret Suggeſtions of their ſeveral Paſſions. 'Tis well known, that the Writer of the <hi>Fable of the Bees</hi> was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Saint</hi> in his Life, nor a <hi>Hermit</hi> in his Diet: He ſeems to have been Maſter of a very conſiderable <hi>Sagacity,</hi> much Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World, as it appears in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Cities,</hi> extremely ſenſible to all the groſſer <hi>bodily</hi> Enjoyments; but for <hi>Delicacy</hi> of Sentiment, Imagination, or Paſſion, for an exquiſite <hi>Taſte</hi> either in <hi>Arts</hi> or <hi>Morals,</hi> he appears to have been <hi>incapable</hi> of it.—The noble Writer is known to have been of a Frame the very Reverſe of this: His <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> was neither more nor leſs oppoſite to Dr. MANDEVILLE's, than his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. His ſenſual Appetites were weak; his Imagination all alive, noble, and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; his Paſſions were accordingly refined, and his public Affections (in <hi>Fancy</hi> at leaſt) predominant. To theſe Inſtances, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Share of Sagacity and Knowledge of the World may add others innumerable, in obſerving the Temper and Conduct of the Followers oſ theſe two Syſtems; who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take Party according to the Biaſs of their own Conſtitution. Among the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1167800100:187"/>
we ever find Men of high Health, florid Complexions, firm Nerves, and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for Pleaſure: Of the <hi>Stoic</hi> Party are the delicate or ſickly Frames, Men incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the groſſer ſenſual Enjoyments, and who either <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>think</hi> themſelves <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Now from theſe accumulated Proofs we may be convinced, that <q rend="inline">"they who give us theſe <hi>uniform</hi> Pictures of a Subject ſo <hi>various</hi> as <hi>Mankind,</hi> cannot have drawn them from <hi>Nature:</hi> That, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they have copied them from their own <hi>Hearts</hi> or <hi>Imaginations;</hi> and fondly erected <hi>themſelves</hi> into a general Standard of the <hi>human Species.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT although theſe Obſervations may afford ſufficient Proof, that the <hi>Stoic</hi> and <hi>Epicurean</hi> Pictures of Mankind are equally partial; yet ſtill it remains to be enquired how far, upon the whole, the human Kind in Reality leans towards the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other:</hi> That is, <q rend="inline">"how far, and in what Degree, the uniform Practice of Virtue conſtitutes the Happineſs of Individuals?"</q> Now the only Method of determining this Queſtion, will be to ſelect ſome of the moſt ſtriking <hi>Features</hi> of the human Heart: By this Means we may <hi>approach</hi> towards a real

                  <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> though from that infinite Variety which ſubſiſts in Nature, the <hi>Draught</hi> muſt ever be inadequate and <hi>defective.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO begin with the loweſt Temperature of the human Species; <q rend="inline">"there are great Numbers of Mankind, in whom the <hi>Senſes</hi> are the chief Sources of Pleaſure and Pain."</q> To the Harmony of Sounds, the Beauty of Forms, the Decorum of Actions, they are utterly inſenſible. They are ſagacious and learned in all the Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of Senſe; but if you talk to them of the public Affections, of Generoſity, Kindneſs, Friendſhip, Good-will, you talk in a Language they underſtand not. They ſeem, in a Manner, unconnected with the reſt of their Kind; they view the Praiſes, Cenſures, Enjoyments and Sufferings of others, with an Eye of perfect Indifference. To Men thus formed, how can Virtue gain Admittance? Do you appeal to their <hi>Taſte</hi> of Beauty? They have none. To their acknowledged Perceptions of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong?</hi> Theſe they Meaſure by their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Intereſt.</hi> To the Force of the public <hi>Affections?</hi> They never felt them. Thus every Avenue is forecloſed, by which <hi>Virtue</hi> ſhould enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1167800100:189"/>
THE next remarkable Peculiarity is, <q rend="inline">"where not the Senſes, but <hi>Imagination</hi> is the predominant Source of Pleaſure."</q> Here the Taſte always runs into the elegant Refinements of polite Arts and Acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; of Painting, Muſic, Architecture, Poetry, Sculpture: Or, in Defect of this truer Taſte, on the falſe Delicacies of Dreſs, Furniture, and Equipage. Yet Experience tells us, that this Character is widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the virtuous one: That all the Powers of Imagination may ſubſiſt in their full Energy, while the <hi>public Affections</hi> and <hi>moral Senſe</hi> are weak or utterly inactive. Nor can there be any neceſſary Connexion between theſe different Feelings; becauſe we ſee Numbers immerſed in all the finer Pleaſures of Imagination, who never once conſider them as the Means of <hi>giving Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> but merely as a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This the noble Writer ſeems to have been aware of; and, not without great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, endeavours to convert the Fact into a Proof of his main Theory, though, in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it affords the ſtrongeſt Evidence againſt him. <q rend="inline">"The <hi>Venuſtum,</hi> the <hi>Honeſtum,</hi> the <hi>Decorum</hi> of Things, will ſorce its Way. They, who refuſe to give it Scope in the

nobler Subjects of a rational and moral Kind, will find its Prevalency elſewhere, in an inferior Order of Things—as either in the Study of common <hi>Arts,</hi> or in the Care and Culture of mere mechanic <hi>Beauties.</hi>—The <hi>Specter</hi> ſtill will <hi>haunt</hi> us, in <hi>ſome Shape or other;</hi> and when driven from our cool Thoughts, and frighted from the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> will meet us even at Court, and fill our Heads with Dreams of Grandeur, Titles, Honours, and a falſe Magnificence and Beauty<note n="t" place="bottom">

                     </note>."</q> All this is ingenious and plauſible: And the very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Alluſion, of <q rend="inline">"the Specter ſtill haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in ſome Shape or other,"</q> ſeems at firſt View to imply, that even the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Endeavours to get rid of the Force of moral Beauty, are ineffectual and vain. But a nearer Examination will convince us, that the noble Writer applies here to <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> rather than <hi>Argument;</hi> and puts us off with a <hi>Metaphor</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For the Pleaſures of Imagination, whether they run in the Channel of polite Arts, Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, Planting, Building, or Equipage, are indeed no <hi>Specters,</hi> but independent <hi>Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> ſairly exiſting in the Mind: They have
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1167800100:191"/>
no immediate or neceſſary Connexion with the Happineſs of Mankind, which is often and <hi>deſignedly</hi> violated in order to gain the Poſſeſſion of them. 'Tis true, the Pleaſures of Imagination and Virtue are often <hi>united</hi> in the ſame Mind; but 'tis equally true, that they are often <hi>ſeparate;</hi> that they who are moſt ſenſible to the <hi>one,</hi> are entire Strangers to the <hi>other;</hi> that one Man, to <hi>purchaſe</hi> a fine <hi>Picture,</hi> will <hi>oppreſs</hi> his Tenant; that another, to <hi>relieve</hi> his diſtreſſed Tenant, will <hi>ſell</hi> his Statues or his Pictures. The Reaſon is evident: The one draws his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from <hi>Imagination;</hi> the other from <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> only. 'Tis clear therefore, that <q rend="inline">"where <hi>Imagination</hi> is naturally the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Source of Pleaſure,"</q> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Virtue muſt be very <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> ſince the chief Happineſs ariſeth from a Source entirely diſtinct from the <hi>benevolent Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANOTHER, and very different Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Heart of Man is that <q rend="inline">"wherein neither Senſe nor Imagination, but the PASSIONS are the chief Sources of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Pain."</q> This often forms the <hi>beſt</hi> or the <hi>worſt</hi> of Characters. As it runs either, Firſt, Into the Extreme of Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1167800100:192"/>
Jealouſy, Pride, Hatred, Envy, and Revenge; or, 2<hi>dly,</hi> Into the amiable Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Hope, Faith, Candour, Pity, Generoſity, and Good-will; or, 3<hi>dly,</hi> Into a various Mixture or Combination of theſe; which is undoubtedly the moſt common Temperature of human Kind.</p>
               <p>NOW to the firſt of theſe Tempers, how can we affirm with Truth, that there is a natural Motive or Obligation to Virtue? On the contrary, it ſhould ſeem, that, if there be any Motive, it muſt be to <hi>Vice.</hi> For 'tis plain, that from the Loſſes, Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and Miſeries of Mankind, ſuch vile Tempers draw their chief Felicity. The noble Writer indeed, in his Zeal for Virtue, conſiders theſe black Paſſions as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,</hi> and brands them as a Source of <hi>conſtant Miſery</hi>

But if indeed this be not a true Repreſentation of the Caſe, I ſee not what Service can be done to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>Virtue,</hi> by <hi>diſguiſing</hi> Truth. 'Tis not the Part of a Philoſopher to write <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrics,</hi> but to <hi>inveſtigate</hi> the real State of human Nature; and the only Way of doing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1167800100:193"/>
this to any good Purpoſe, is to do it <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially:</hi> For with regard to human Nature, as well as Individuals, <q rend="inline">"Flattery is a Crime no leſs than Slander."</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN therefore the noble Writer calls theſe Affections <hi>unnatural,</hi> he doth not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently explain himſelf. If indeed by their being unnatural, he means, that <q rend="inline">"they are ſuch in their Degrees or Objects as to violate the public Happineſs, which is the main Intention of Nature;"</q> in this Senſe, 'tis acknowledged, they are <hi>unnatural.</hi> But this Interpretation is foreign to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; becauſe it affects not the <hi>Individual.</hi> But if, by their being <hi>unnatural,</hi> he would imply, that they are <q rend="inline">"a Source of conſtant Miſery to the Agent;"</q> this ſeems a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition not eaſy to be determined in the Affirmative.</p>
               <p>FOR the main Proof which he brings in Support of this Aſſertion is, <q rend="inline">"that the Men of <hi>gentleſt Diſpoſitions,</hi> and <hi>beſt of Tempers,</hi> have at ſome time or other been ſufficiently acquainted with thoſe Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, which, at ill Hours, even ſmall Occaſions are apt to raiſe.

the ill Moments which are paſſed, when the Temper is ever ſo little galled and fretted.

               </p>
               <p>NOW, this Inſtance is by no means ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupport the Affirmation. For 'tis plain, that in the Caſe of the <q rend="inline">"Men of gentleſt Diſpoſitions, and beſt of Tempers, occaſionally agitated by ill Humour,"</q> there muſt be a ſtrong Oppoſition and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance, a violent Conflict between the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Affections of Benevolence, and theſe accidental Eruptions of Spleen and Rancour which riſe to obſtruct their Courſe. A Warfare of this Kind muſt indeed be a State of complete Miſery, when all is Uproar within, and the diſtracted Heart ſet at Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with itſelf. But the Caſe is widely different, where <q rend="inline">"a thorow active Spleen prevails, a cloſe and <hi>ſettled</hi> Malignity and Rancour."</q> For in this Temper, there is no parallel Oppoſition of contending Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Nor therefore any ſimilar Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Benevolence predominate, in this beſt and happieſt of Tempers, Virtue hath indeed all the Force and Energy, which the noble Writer attributes to her Charms. For where the Calls of Senſe are weak, the Imagination active and refined, the public Affections predominant; there the <hi>moral Senſe</hi> muſt naturally reign with uncontrouled Authority; muſt produce all that Self-Satisfaction, that Conſciouſneſs of merited Kindneſs and Eſteem, in which, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip affirms, the very Eſſence of our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Virtue doth conſiſt.

               <p>FROM theſe different Views of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, let us now bring this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Concluſion.</p>
               <p>THE noble Writer's Scheme of Morals therefore, being grounded on a Suppoſition, which runs through the whole Courſe of his Argument, that <q rend="inline">"all Mankind are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally capable of attaining a <hi>Taſte</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> for <hi>Virtue,</hi> ſufficient for every Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſocial Life,"</q> ſeems eſſentially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. For, from the Enquiry already made into the real and various Conſtitution
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1167800100:199"/>
of Man, it appears, that a great Part of the Species are naturally incapable of this <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied</hi> Excellence. That the various Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Predominancy of <hi>Senſe, Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> give a different Caſt and Complexion of Mind to every Individual: That the <hi>Feeling</hi> or <hi>Proſpect</hi> of Happineſs can only ariſe from this Combination: That conſequently, where the benevolent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and moral Senſe are weak, the ſelfiſh Paſſions and Perceptions headſtrong, there can be no internal Motive or natural Obligation to the <hi>conſiſtent</hi> Practice of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>THE moſt plauſible Pretence I could ever meet with, amidſt all the Pomp of Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thrown out in Support of this <hi>All-Sufficiency</hi> of a <hi>Taſte</hi> in Morals, is this. <q rend="inline">"That although the Force and Energy of this Taſte for Virtue appears not in every Individual, yet the Power lies dormant in every human Breaſt; and needs only be called forth by a <hi>voluntary Self-Diſcipline,</hi> in order to be brought to its juſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. That the Improvement in our Taſte in Morals is parallel to the Progreſs of the Mind in every other Art and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, in <hi>Painting, Muſic, Architecture,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THE noble Writer hath innumerable Paſſages of this Kind: So many indeed, that it were Labour loſt to tranſcribe them<note n="a" place="bottom">

               <p>NOW this State of the Caſe, though at firſt View it carries ſome Degree of Plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yet, on a cloſer Examination, deſtroys the whole Syſtem. For if, as it certainly is, the <hi>Capacity</hi> for a Taſte in <hi>Morals,</hi> be ſimilar to a <hi>Capacity</hi> for a Taſte in <hi>Arts;</hi> 'tis clear, that the moſt aſſiduous Culture or Self-Diſcipline can never make it even <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> much leſs <hi>univerſal.</hi> One Man, we ſee, hath a Capacity or Genius for Painting, another for Muſic, a third for Architecture, a fourth for Poetry. Torture each of them as you pleaſe, you cannot infuſe a Taſte for any, but his own <hi>congenial</hi> Art. If you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1167800100:201"/>
to make the Poet an Architect, or the Painter a Muſician, you may make a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <hi>Pedant,</hi> never an accompliſhed <hi>Maſter.</hi> 'Tis the ſame in Morals: Where the benevolent Affections are naturally ſtrong, <hi>there</hi> is a <hi>Capacity</hi> for a high <hi>Taſte</hi> in Virtue: Where theſe are <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>wanting,</hi> there is in the ſame Proportion, <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no Capacity</hi> for a <hi>Taſte</hi> in Virtue. To harangue, therefore, on the ſuperior Happineſs attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Exerciſe of the public Affections, is quite foreign to the Purpoſe. This ſuperior Happineſs is allowed, where the public Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections can be <hi>found</hi> or <hi>made</hi> predominant. But how can any Conſequence be drawn from hence, ſo as to influence thoſe who never felt the Impulſe of public Affection? Are not the Pleaſures of Poetry, Painting, Muſic, ſublime, pure, and laſting, to thoſe who <hi>taſte</hi> them? Doth it therefore follow, that all Mankind, or any of them, can be harangued into a <hi>Taſte</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of theſe elegant Arts, while the very Capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Pleaſure from them is <hi>wanting?</hi> Thus in Morals, where a ſimilar Incapacity takes Place through the natural Want of a lively Benevolence, no Progreſs can ever be made in the <hi>Taſte</hi> or <hi>Reliſh</hi> for virtuous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment.

                     </note>."</q> And this I take to be a true Account of the Matter.</p>
               <p>THUS, as according to theſe Moraliſts, the <hi>Reliſh</hi> or <hi>Taſte</hi> for Virtue is ſimilar to a Taſte for Arts; ſo what is ſaid of the Poet, the Painter, and Muſician, may with equal Truth be ſaid of the Man of Virtue—<hi>Naſcitur, non fit.</hi> Hence it is evident, that the noble Writer's Syſtem, which ſuppoſeth all Men capable of this exalted Taſte, is chimerical and groundleſs.</p>
               <p>BUT even ſuppoſing all Men capable of this refined Taſte in Morals, there would ariſe an unanſwerable Objection againſt the Efficacy of this refined Theory. Though it were allowed, that all Mankind have the ſame delicate Perception of <hi>moral,</hi> as ſome few have of <hi>natural</hi> Beauty, yet the Parallel would by no means hold, that <q rend="inline">"as the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo</hi> always purſues his Taſte in Arts <hi>conſiſtently,</hi> ſo the Man of <hi>Virtue</hi> muſt be equally <hi>conſiſtent</hi> in <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>"</q> For the <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> being only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in mere <hi>Speculation,</hi> hath no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Affections to counteract his Taſte: He
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1167800100:205"/>
meets with no Obſtructions in his Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Beauty: His Enthuſiaſm takes its unbounded Flight, not retarded by any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of a diſcordant Nature. But the Man of <hi>Virtue</hi> hath a different and more difficult Taſk to perform: He hath often a numerous Train of Paſſions, and theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the moſt violent to oppoſe: He muſt labour through the ſurrounding Demands and Allurements of ſelfiſh Appetite: Muſt ſubdue the Sollicitations of every the moſt natural Affection, when it oppoſes the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of a pure Benevolence. Hence even ſuppoſing the moſt refined Taſte for Virtue common to all, it muſt ever be retarded in its Progreſs, often baffled and overthrown amidſt the <hi>Struggle</hi> of contending <hi>Paſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS ſeems to be a full and ſufficient Reply to all that can be urged in Support of this fantaſtic Syſtem from a View of <hi>human Nature.</hi> But as the noble Writer hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to confirm his Theory by ſome collateral Arguments of another Kind, it may be proper here to conſider their real Weight.</p>
               <p>HE urges, therefore, the Probability at leaſt, if not the certain Truth of his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis from hence, <q rend="inline">"That it would be an
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1167800100:206"/>

                     </note>."</q> And beyond Queſtion, the Aſſertion is true: But the Conſequence he draws from it, <q rend="inline">"that therefore human Happineſs muſt always conſiſt in the immediate Feeling of virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enjoyment,"</q> is utterly groundleſs. This Inference ſeems to have been drawn from a View of the <hi>Brute</hi> Creation; in which, we find, <hi>Inſtincts</hi> or <hi>immediate Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> are the only Motives to Action; and in which, we find too, that theſe immediate Propenſities are <hi>ſufficient</hi> for all the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of their Being. In this Conſtitution of Things the Creator's Wiſdom is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently diſplayed; becauſe, through a Defect of <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Reflexion,</hi> no other kind of Principle could poſſibly have taken Place. But the Concluſion drawn from thence, <q rend="inline">"that Man muſt have a ſimilar Strength of Inſtinct implanted in him, in order to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him to his ſupreme Happineſs,"</q> this is without Foundation: Becauſe the Deity hath given him not only <hi>preſent</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1167800100:207"/>
but <hi>Reaſon, Reflexion,</hi> and a <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight</hi> of <hi>future</hi> Good and Evil, together with a ſufficient Power to obtain the one, and avoid the other. As therefore Man hath ſufficient Notices of the <hi>moral Government</hi> of GOD, which will at length produce a perfect Coincidence between the <hi>virtuous</hi> Conduct and the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of every Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, it implies no eſſential Defect of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Creator, to ſuppoſe that he hath not given this <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>unerring</hi> Biaſs towards Virtue to the whole human Species. Man is enabled to purſue and obtain his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Happineſs by <hi>Reaſon;</hi> Brutes by <hi>Inſtinct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, the noble Writer often attempts to ſtrengthen his Argument, by <q rend="inline">"repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>external Good</hi> which naturally <hi>flows</hi> from <hi>Virtue,</hi> and the <hi>external</hi> Evils which naturally <hi>attend</hi> on Vice<note n="i" place="bottom">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1167800100:208"/>
theſe <hi>Externals</hi> are not <hi>immediate,</hi> but <hi>conſequential,</hi> not <hi>certain,</hi> but <hi>contingent:</hi> They are preciſely of the Nature of <hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment;</hi> and therefore can have no Part in the Queſtion now before us; which relates ſolely to <q rend="inline">"that Happineſs or Miſery ariſing from the inward State of the <hi>Mind, Affections,</hi> and <hi>moral Senſe,</hi> on the Commiſſion of Vice, or the Practice of <hi>Virtue.</hi>"</q> And this hath been already conſidered at large.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, that nothing may be omitted which can even remotely affect the Truth; we may obſerve, in paſſing, that after all the laboured and <hi>well-meant</hi> Declamation on this Subject, 'tis much eaſier to prove, <q rend="inline">"that <hi>Vice</hi> is the Parent of <hi>external</hi> Miſery, than that <hi>Virtue</hi> is the Parent of <hi>external</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs."</q> 'Tis plain, that no Man can be vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any conſiderable <hi>Degree,</hi> but he muſt ſuffer either in his <hi>Health,</hi> his <hi>Fame,</hi> or <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi> Now the Generality of Moraliſts, after proving or illuſtrating this, have taken it for granted, as a certain Conſequence, that the external Goods of Life are, by the Law of Contraries, in a ſimilar Manner annexed to the Practice of Virtue. But in Reality the Proof can reach no further than to ſhew
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1167800100:209"/>
the happy Conſequences of <hi>Innocence,</hi> which is a very different Thing from <hi>Virtue;</hi> for <hi>Innocence</hi> is only the <hi>abſtaining</hi> from <hi>Evil; Virtue,</hi> the actual Production of <hi>Good.</hi> Now 'tis evident indeed, that by <hi>abſtaining</hi> from <hi>Evil</hi> (that is, by <hi>Innocence</hi>) we <hi>muſt</hi> ſtand clear of the Miſeries to which we expoſe ourſelves by the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of it: And this is as far as the Argument will go. But if we rigorouſly examine the external Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of an <hi>active</hi> Virtue, in ſuch a World as this; we ſhall find, it muſt be often maintained at the Expence both of <hi>Health, Eaſe,</hi> and <hi>Fortune;</hi> often the Loſs of Friends, and Increaſe of Enemies; not to mention the unwearied Diligence of <hi>Envy,</hi> which is ever watchful and prepared to blaſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Merit. In the mean time, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious</hi> Man ſits unmoleſted and tranquil; <hi>loves</hi> Virtue, and <hi>praiſeth</hi> it; avoids the <hi>Miſeries</hi> of <hi>Vice,</hi> and the <hi>Fatigues</hi> of <hi>active</hi> Virtue; offends no Man, and therefore is beloved by all; and for the reſt, makes it up by fair <hi>Words</hi> and civil Deportment. <q rend="inline">"Thus <hi>Innocence,</hi> and not <hi>Virtue; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlinence</hi> from <hi>Evil,</hi> not the <hi>Production</hi> of Good, is the furtheſt Point to which Mankind in general can be carried, from

a Regard to the <hi>external</hi> Conſequences of Action."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT whenever Appearances grow too ſtrong againſt the noble Writer's Syſtem, he takes Refuge in an—<hi>apage Vulgus!</hi>—As he had before allowed, that <q rend="inline">"the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar may ſwallow any ſordid Jeſt or Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry,"</q> ſo here he frequently ſuggeſts, that among the ſame Ranks, <q rend="inline">"any kind of ſordid Pleaſure will go down."</q> But <q rend="inline">"as it muſt be a finer Kind of Wit that takes with the Men of Breeding,"</q> ſo in Morals <q rend="inline">"the <hi>Reliſh</hi> or <hi>Taſle</hi> for Virtue, is what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally prevails in the higher Stages of Life: That the <hi>liberal</hi> and <hi>poliſhed</hi> Part of Mankind are diſpoſed to treat every other Principle of Action as groundleſs and <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary:</hi> But that among theſe, the <hi>Taſte</hi> in Morals, if properly cultivated, muſt needs be ſufficient for all the Purpoſes of Virtue<note n="k" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>IN reply to this, which is perhaps the weakeſt Pretence of all that the noble Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath alledged, we need only obſerve, that thoſe who are born to <hi>Honours, Power,</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> come into the World with the

ſame <hi>various</hi> Mixture and <hi>Predominancy</hi> of <hi>Senſe, Imagination,</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> with the <hi>loweſt</hi> Ranks of Mankind. So that if they really enjoy better Opportunities of being compleatly virtuous, theſe muſt ariſe not from their internal <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> but their external <hi>Situation</hi> in Life. Let us examine how far this may give a Biaſs either towards Vice or Virtue.</p>
               <p>NOW 'tis plain that, with regard to the <hi>Senſes</hi> or bodily <hi>Appetites,</hi> the Poſſeſſion of Power and Fortune muſt be rather hurtful than favourable to Virtue. Wealth gives Opportunity of <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and Indulgence naturally <hi>inflames.</hi> Hence the Habits of <hi>ſenſual</hi> Inclination muſt in general be ſtronger in the <hi>Lord</hi> than the <hi>Peaſant:</hi> Therefore, as nothing tends ſo much to imbrute the Man, and ſink every nobler Affection of the Mind, as a ſervile Attendance on ſenſual Pleaſure; ſo in this Regard, the Poſſeſſion of Power and Fortune is rather <hi>dangerous</hi> than ſavourable to Virtue.</p>
               <p>THE ſame may be affirmed in reſpect to the <hi>Paſſions</hi> or <hi>Affections.</hi> Can any thing tend ſo much to render any Paſſion ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable, as to know that we <hi>need not</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it? That our Power, Riches, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1167800100:212"/>
raiſe us <hi>above Controul?</hi> That we can hate, oppreſs, revenge, with <hi>Impunity?</hi> Are not the <hi>Great,</hi> of all others, moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to <hi>Flattery?</hi> Does not this tend to produce and nouriſh an <hi>overweening</hi> Opinion of <hi>themſelves,</hi> an unjuſt <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>others?</hi> And is not <hi>true Virtue</hi> more likely to be <hi>loſt</hi> than improved, amidſt all theſe ſurrounding Temptations?</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Imagination</hi> indeed is often refined, and <hi>Reaſon</hi> improved, in the higher Ranks of Life, beyond the Reach of the <hi>mere Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> But they are little acquainted with human Nature, who think that <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> among the Bulk of Mankind, are any thing more than the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>ruling Appetites</hi> and <hi>Paſſions:</hi> Eſpecially where the Appetites and Paſſions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the <hi>early</hi> and <hi>habitual</hi> Poſſeſſion of Honours, Power, and Riches.</p>
               <p>BUT ſtill it will be urged, that the <hi>Great</hi> are under the Dominion of a powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which is almoſt unknown among the <hi>Vulgar:</hi>—The Principle of HONOUR—which is a perfect <hi>Balance</hi> againſt all theſe ſurrounding Difficulties, and a full <hi>Security</hi> to <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1167800100:213"/>
WITH regard to this <hi>boaſted</hi> Principle, a very material Diſtinction muſt be made. By <hi>Honour,</hi> is ſometimes meant <q rend="inline">"an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Mind determining the Agent to the Practice of what is right, without any Dependence on other Men's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions."</q> Now this is but the <hi>moral Senſe,</hi> under a new Appellation: It ariſeth too, not from any particular <hi>Situation</hi> of Life, but from the natural <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the Mind. Accordingly, it is not confined to any one Rank of Men, but is ſeen promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly among the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Vulgar.</hi> 'Tis therefore entirely beyond the preſent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which only relates to ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as are peculiar to <hi>high Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE other, and more common Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Word <hi>Honour,</hi> and in which alone it belongs peculiarly to the <hi>Great,</hi> is <q rend="inline">"an Affection of the Mind determining the Agent to ſuch a Conduct, as may gain him the <hi>Applauſe</hi> or <hi>Eſteem</hi> of thoſe whoſe good Opinion he is fond of."</q> Now this Love of <hi>Fame,</hi> and Fear of <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> though, as a <hi>ſecondary</hi> Motive to Action, it be often of the higheſt Conſequence in Life; though it often <hi>counterfeits,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even <hi>rivals</hi> Benevolence itſelf; yet as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1167800100:214"/>
a <hi>principal</hi> Motive, there cannot be a more <hi>precarious</hi> Foundation of Virtue. For the <hi>Effects</hi> of this Principle will always depend on the <hi>Opinions</hi> of others: It will always take its particular Complexion from <hi>theſe,</hi> and muſt always <hi>vary</hi> with them. Thus 'tis a Matter of mere <hi>Accident,</hi> whether its Conſequences be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad, wholeſome</hi> or <hi>pernicious.</hi> If the <hi>applanded Maxims</hi> be founded in <hi>Benevolence,</hi> the Principle will ſo far lead to <hi>Virtue:</hi> If they be founded in <hi>Pride, Folly,</hi> or <hi>Contempt,</hi> the Principle will lead to <hi>Vice.</hi> And, without any deſigned Satire on the <hi>Great,</hi> it muſt be owned, the latter of theſe hath ever been the <hi>predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> Character of <hi>Honour.</hi> It were falſe indeed to affirm, that the Principle hath no Mixture of <hi>benevolent</hi> Intention; yet 'tis equally clear, that its <hi>chief</hi> Deſign is not ſo much to ſecure the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> as to maintain the <hi>Superiority</hi> of a <hi>few:</hi> And hence this Principle hath ever led its Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to abhor the Commiſſion, not ſo much of what is <hi>unjuſt,</hi> as of what is <hi>contemptible.</hi> Thus it is clear, that the Principle of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>benevolent</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and the <hi>moral Senſe,</hi> can never be a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1167800100:215"/>
ſufficient Foundation for the <hi>uniform</hi> Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE are the main Arguments by which the noble Writer hath attempted to ſupport this imagined <hi>All-ſufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Reliſh</hi> or <hi>Taſte</hi> in <hi>Morals.</hi> Had human Nature been indeed that <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> Thing, which he ſeems to have <hi>thought</hi> it, he had ſurely been right in fixing the <hi>Obligations</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> to <hi>Virtue,</hi> on ſo generous and amiable a Principle. But as on Examination it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that he hath all along ſuppoſed this human Nature to be <hi>what it is not,</hi> his Syſtem is <hi>viſionary</hi> and <hi>groundleſs;</hi> and his applauded Theory only fit to find a Place with the boaſted Power of the great old <hi>Geometer,</hi> when he ſaid—<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>HAVING ſufficiently evinced the <hi>flimzy,</hi> though curious, Contexture of theſe <hi>Cobweb</hi> Speculations <hi>ſpun</hi> in the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> let us now venture abroad into the World; let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſomething applicable to Life and Manners; and conſider what are the real Motives, by which Mankind may be ſway'd to the <hi>uniform</hi> Practice of <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND firſt, in Minds of a <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Diſpoſition, where the ſenſual Appetites are weak, the Imagination refined, and the benevolent Affections naturally predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; theſe very Affections, and the <hi>moral Senſe</hi> ariſing from them, will in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Occurrences of Life ſecure the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Virtue. To theſe fine Tempers thus happily formed, the inward Satisfaction of a virtuous Conduct exceeds that of every outward Acquiſition; and affords to its Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1167800100:218"/>
a more true and laſting Happineſs, than Wealth, or Fame, or Power can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, Where the ſame Degrees of public Affection ſubſiſt, but ſtand oppoſed by ſenſual or ſelfiſh Paſſions of equal Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, even here the Agent may riſe to very high Degrees of Virtue, but not without the Aids of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Culture.</hi> Yet 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that the Virtues of ſuch a Temper are rather <hi>conſpicuous</hi> than <hi>conſiſtent:</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſtrengthening Aſſiſtance, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Mind towards Perfection is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten broke by the Sallies of diſordered Paſſion.</p>
               <p>THERE is yet another Character, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially different from theſe, but ſeldom diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, becauſe generally taken for the <hi>firſt.</hi> Many eſteem themſelves, and are eſteemed by others, as having arrived at the moſt <hi>conſummate Virtue,</hi> whoſe Conduct never merits a higher Name than that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>innoxious.</hi> This is generally the Caſe of thoſe who love <hi>Retreat</hi> and <hi>Contemplation,</hi> of thoſe whoſe Paſſions are naturally <hi>weak,</hi> or carefully <hi>guarded</hi> by what the World calls <hi>Prudence.</hi> Now, as in the laſt mentioned Character, a <hi>Curb</hi> from <hi>Irregularity</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, ſo here a <hi>Spur</hi> to <hi>Action</hi> is equally
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1167800100:219"/>
neceſſary for the Support and Security of Virtue.</p>
               <p>AS we deſcend through more common and inferior Characters, the internal Motives to virtuous Action grow leſs and leſs ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. <hi>Weak</hi> or <hi>no</hi> Benevolence, a moral Senſe proportionably <hi>dull,</hi> ſtrong ſenſual <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,</hi> a clamorous Train of <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, theſe mixed and varied in endleſs Combinations, form the real Character of the <hi>Bulk</hi> of Mankind: Not only in <hi>Cottages,</hi> but in <hi>Cities, Churches, Camps,</hi> and <hi>Courts.</hi> So that ſome ſtronger Ties, ſome Motives more efficacious are neceſſary, not only for the Perfection of <hi>Virtue,</hi> but the Welfare, nay, the very Being of <hi>Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS not denied, nay, 'tis meant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, that among all theſe various Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and Tempers, the Culture of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Affections ought to be aſſiduouſly regarded. For though we have ſeen that the Deſign of introducing an univerſal high <hi>Reliſh</hi> or <hi>Taſte</hi> for Virtue be <hi>viſionary</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> yet ſtill a lower, or a lower Degree may <hi>poſſibly</hi> be inſtilled. We have only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to prove, that the Capacity for this high Taſte in Morals is not univerſally or eſſentially interwoven with the human
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1167800100:220"/>
Frame, but diſpenſed in various Degrees, in the ſame Manner as the Capacity for a Taſte in <hi>inferior</hi> Beauties, in <hi>Architecture, Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Poetry,</hi> and <hi>Muſic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO remedy this <hi>Defect</hi> of <hi>unerring</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in Man, by which he becomes a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo much leſs conſiſtent than the Brute Kinds, Providence hath afforded him not only a Senſe of <hi>preſent,</hi> but a Foreſight of <hi>future Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HENCE the Force of human Laws, which being eſtabliſhed by common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for the Good of all, endeavour, ſo far as their Power can reach, by the Infliction of Puniſhment on Offenders, to eſtabliſh the general Happineſs of Society, by making the <hi>acknowledged Intereſt</hi> of every <hi>Individual</hi> to coincide and unite with the <hi>public</hi> Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare.</p>
               <p>BUT as human Laws cannot reach the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man; as they can only inflict <hi>Puniſhment</hi> on Offenders, but cannot beſtow <hi>Rewards</hi> on the Obedient; as there are many Duties of <hi>imperfect</hi> Obligation which they cannot recognize; as <hi>Force</hi> will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>defy,</hi> and <hi>Cunning</hi> often <hi>elude</hi> their Power; ſo without ſome further Aids, ſome Motives to Action more <hi>univerſally</hi> intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1167800100:221"/>
Virtue muſt ſtill be left betrayed and deſerted.</p>
               <p>Now as it is clear from the Courſe of theſe Obſervations, that nothing can work this great Effect, but what can produce <q rend="inline">"an entire and univerſal Coincidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween private and public Happineſs;"</q> ſo is it equally evident, that nothing can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually convince Mankind, that their own Happineſs univerſally depends on <hi>procuring,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>not violating</hi> the Happineſs of others, ſave only <q rend="inline">"the lively and active Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of an all-ſeeing and all-powerful GOD, who will hereafter make them happy or miſerable, according as they deſignedly promote or violate the Happineſs of their Fellow-Creatures."</q> And this is the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of RELIGION.</p>
               <p>THIS, at firſt View, ſhould ſeem a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Principle of Action, ſufficient for all the Purpoſes of Happineſs and Virtue. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Bulk of Mankind ſeem agreed in this Truth. Yet refining Tempers, who love to quit the common Tracks of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, have been bold enough to call even this in Queſtion. Among theſe, the noble Writer hath been one of the moſt diligent:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1167800100:222"/>
It will therefore be neceſſary to conſider the Weight of his Objections.</p>
               <p>TO prevent Miſinterpretation, it may be proper to obſerve, that Lord SHAFTESBURY ſometimes talks in earneſt of the <hi>Nobleneſs</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> But when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf, it appears, he confines his Idea of it to that Part which conſiſts ſolely in Gratitude to, and Adoration of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, without any Proſpect of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happineſs or Miſery. Now, though indeed this be the nobleſt Part, yet it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Reach of all, ſave only thoſe who are capable of the moſt <hi>exalted</hi> Degrees of Virtue. His Theory of <hi>Religion</hi> therefore is preciſely of a Piece, with his Theory of the <hi>moral Senſe;</hi> not calculated for Uſe, but Admiration; and only exiſting in the Place where they had their Birth; that is, as the noble Writer well expreſſeth it, in <hi>a Mind taken up in Viſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE ſometimes talks, or ſeems to talk, in earneſt too, on the <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> in the common Acceptation of the Word. With Regard to which 'tis only neceſſary to obſerve, that whatever he hath ſaid on this Subject I readily aſſent to: But this is no Reaſon why it may not be neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1167800100:223"/>
every thing he hath thrown out to the contrary, to prejudice common Readers againſt Religion, through the Vanity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought <hi>Original.</hi> To <hi>invent</hi> what is <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>uſeful,</hi> is the Character of <hi>Genius:</hi> 'Tis <hi>Folly</hi> only and <hi>Impertinence</hi> to broach <hi>Abſurdities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FIRST, therefore, he often aſſerts, that <q rend="inline">"the Hope of future Reward and Fear of future Puniſhment is utterly unworthy of the free Spirit of a Man, and only fit for thoſe who are deſtitute of the very firſt Principles of common Honeſty: He calls it <hi>miſerable, vile, mercenary:</hi> And compares thoſe who allow it any Weight, to <hi>Monkies</hi> under the Diſcipline of the Whip<note n="p" place="bottom">

               <p>IN Anſwer to theſe general Cavils (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably aimed principally at <hi>Revelation</hi>) which are only difficult to confute, as they are vague and fugitive, let it be obſerved, firſt; that whatever can be objected againſt <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Fear, holds good againſt the Fear of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Laws. They <hi>both</hi> threaten the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent with the Infliction of Puniſhment, nor is the Fear of the one more unworthy, than of the other. Yet the noble Writer
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1167800100:224"/>
himſelf often ſpeaks with the higheſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Legiſlators,</hi> of the Founders of <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Empire,</hi> who, by the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wiſe and wholeſome Laws, drew Mankind from their State of natural Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, to that of cultivated Life and ſocial Happineſs: Unleſs indeed he ſuppoſes that ORPHEUS and the reſt of them did their Buſineſs <hi>literally</hi> by <hi>Taſte</hi> and a <hi>Fiddle.</hi> If therefore the juſt Fear of <hi>human</hi> Power might be inforced without inſulting or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the <hi>Generoſity</hi> of our Nature, whence comes it, that a juſt Fear of the <hi>Creator</hi> ſhould ſo miſerably degrade the Species? The religious Principle holds forth the ſame Motive to Action, and only differs from the other, as the Evil it threatens is infinitely greater, and more laſting.</p>
               <p>FURTHER: If we conſider the religious Principle in its true Light, there is nothing in it either <hi>mean, ſlaviſh,</hi> or <hi>unworthy.</hi> To be in a <hi>Fright</hi> indeed, to live under the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of <hi>perpetual Terror</hi> (in which, the noble Writer would perſuade us, the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principle conſiſts) is far from an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition. But this belongs only to the <hi>Superſtitious</hi> or the <hi>Guilty.</hi> The firſt of theſe are <hi>ſalſely</hi> religious; and to the laſt, I
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1167800100:225"/>
imagine the noble Writer's moſt zealous Admirers will acknowledge, it <hi>ought</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. But to the reſt of Mankind, the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> Principle or <hi>Fear</hi> of GOD is of a quite different Nature. It only implies a lively and habitual Belief, that we ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after miſerable, if we diſobey his Laws. Thus every wiſe Man, nay, every Man of common Underſtanding, hath a <hi>like Fear</hi> of every <hi>poſſible Evil;</hi> of the deſtructive Power of natural Agents, of <hi>Fire, Water, Serpents, Poiſon:</hi> Yet none of theſe Fears, more than the religious one, imply a State of <hi>perpetual</hi> Miſery and Apprehenſion: None of them are inconſiſtent with the moſt generous Temper of Mind, or trueſt Courage. None of them imply more than a <hi>rational Senſe</hi> of theſe ſeveral Kinds of Evil; and from that Senſe, <hi>a Determination to avoid them.</hi> Thus the noble Writer himſelf, when it anſwers a different Purpoſe, acknowledges that <q rend="inline">"a Man of Courage may be <hi>cautious</hi> without real Fear<note n="q" place="bottom">

Eſſence of the religious Principle or the <hi>Fear</hi> of GOD.</p>
               <p>AND as to the other Branch of religious Principle, <q rend="inline">"the Hope and Proſpect of higher Degrees of future Happineſs and Perfection:"</q>—What is there of <hi>mean, ſlaviſh,</hi> or <hi>unworthy</hi> in it? Are all Mankind to be blown up into the <hi>Mock-majeſty</hi> of the <hi>kingly</hi> STOIC, ſeated on the Throne of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance,</hi> and <hi>lording</hi> it in an <hi>empty</hi> Region of CHIMAERA's? Is not the Proſpect of Happineſs the great univerſal Hinge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Action? Do not all the Powers of the Soul centre in this one Point? Doth not the noble Writer himſelf elſewhere acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this<note n="r" place="bottom">

                  </note>? And that our Obligations to Virtue itſelf can only ariſe from this one Principle, that it gives us real Happineſs? Why then ſhould the Hope of a happy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality be branded as <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>ſlaviſh,</hi> while the Conſciouſneſs or Proſpect of a happy Life on Earth is regarded as a juſt and honourable Motive?</p>
               <p>THE noble Writer indeed confeſſeth, that <q rend="inline">"if by the Hope of Reward, be underſtood the Love and Deſire (he ought to have ſaid, the <hi>Hope</hi>) of <hi>virtuous Enjoyment,</hi> it
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1167800100:227"/>
is not derogatory to Virtue."</q> But that in every other Senſe, the indulged Hope of Reward is not only mean and mercenary, but even <hi>hurtful</hi> to Virtue and common <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"For in this religious Sort of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, the Principle of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> which is <hi>naturally ſo prevailing</hi> in us <hi>(indeed?)</hi> being no way moderated or reſtrained, but rather improved and made ſtronger every Day, by the Exerciſe of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in a Subject of more extended Self-Intereſt; there may be reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend leſt the Temper of this kind ſhould extend itſelf in general through all the Parts of Life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS, to ſay the beſt of it, is the very <hi>Phrenzy</hi> of Virtue. Religion propoſeth true Happineſs as the End and Conſequence of virtuous Action: This is granted. It propoſeth it by ſuch Motives as muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence Self-Love, and conſequently hath given the beſt Means of procuring it. Yet, it ſeems, Self-Love being not reſtrained, but made ſtronger, will make Man kind miſs of true Happineſs. That is, by leading Self-Love into the Path of <hi>true</hi> Happineſs, Religion will inevitably conduct it to <hi>falſe;</hi> by commanding us to <hi>cheriſh</hi> our <hi>public</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1167800100:228"/>
it will certainly <hi>inflame</hi> the <hi>private</hi> ones; by aſſuring us, that if we would be happy hereafter, we muſt be <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>benevolent,</hi> it will beyond Queſtion render us <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>void</hi> of <hi>Benevolence.</hi> But this Mode of Reaſoning is common with the noble Writer.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, at other Times his Lordſhip can deſcend to the Level of common Senſe; and proſecute his Argument by Proofs dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to what he here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth. For in proving the Obligations of Man to Virtue, after having modelled the inward State of the human Mind according to his own Imagination, he proceeds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>Paſſions</hi> which regard <hi>ourſelves,</hi> and draws another, and indeed a ſtronger Proof from <hi>theſe.</hi>—He there proves<note n="s" place="bottom">

Thus he awakens the ſame Paſſions of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> which, in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious View, he ſo bitterly inveighs againſt. Thus he exhibits a Picture of future <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> even of the moſt <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Kind: He recommends the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Virtue, on the Score both of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future <hi>Advantage:</hi> He <hi>deters</hi> his Reader from the Commiſſion of Vice, by repreſenting the Miſery it will produce.

of more extended Self-Intereſt: And ſo there may be Reaſon to apprehend, leſt the Temper of this Kind ſhould extend itſelf in general through all the Parts of Life."</q> Thus the Objection proves equally againſt both: In Reality, againſt neither. For, as we have ſeen, the <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Proſpect</hi> of Happineſs, is the only poſſible Motive to Action; and if we are taught to believe that <hi>virtuous Affection</hi> will produce <hi>Happineſs,</hi> whether the expected Happineſs lies in <hi>this</hi> Life, or <hi>another,</hi> it will <hi>tend,</hi> and <hi>equally</hi> tend, to produce <hi>virtuous</hi> Affection. The noble Writer, therefore, and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, might as well attempt to remove Mountains, as to prove that the <hi>Hope</hi> and Proſpect of a happy Immortality, can juſtly be accounted more ſervile, mercenary, or <hi>hurtful,</hi> than the View of thoſe tranſient and earthly Advantages, which his Lordſhip hath ſo rhetorically and honeſtly diſplay'd, for the Intereſt and Security of <hi>Virtue.</hi> In Truth, they are preciſely of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and only differ in Time, Duration, and Degree.

                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:1167800100:231"/>
it were <hi>abſurd,</hi> as well as <hi>impious,</hi> to attempt to <hi>ſeparate</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="bottom">
                     <p>Hence we may ſee the Weakneſs and Miſtake of thoſe <hi>fulſely religious,</hi> who fall into an <hi>Extreme</hi> directly <hi>oppoſite</hi> to this of the noble Writer; who are <hi>ſcandalized</hi> at our being determined to the Purſuit of Virtue through any Degree of Regard to its happy Conſequences in this Life; which Regard they call <hi>worldly, carnal, prophane.</hi> For it is evident, that the religious Motive is preciſely of the ſame Kind; only <hi>ſtronger,</hi> as the Happineſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected is <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>laſting.</hi> While therefore we ſet the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>proportioned</hi> Value upon each, it is impoſſible we can act irrationally, or offend that GOD who eſtabliſhed <hi>both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This naturally leads to a further Obſervation, which ſhews the Danger, as well as Folly, of <hi>groveling</hi> in <hi>Syſtems.</hi> Virtue, we ſee, comes recommended and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced on three Principles.

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>THERE is yet another Circumſtance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in human Nature, which ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proves, that the Hope of a happy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality hath no Tendency to produce ſelfiſh Affection, but its contrary.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1167800100:232"/>
that Man is never ſo ſincerely and heartily <hi>benevolent,</hi> as when he is truly <hi>happy</hi> in himſelf."</q> Thus the high Conſciouſneſs of his being numbered among the Children of GOD, and that his Lot is among the Saints; that he is deſtined to an endleſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Happineſs, and to riſe from high to higher Degrees of Perfection, muſt needs inſpire him with that Tranquillity and Joy, which will naturally diffuſe itſelf in Acts of ſincere Benevolence to all his Fellow-Creatures, whom he looks upon as his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in this Race of Glory. Thus will every noble Paſſion of the Soul be awakened into Action: While the joyleſs Infidel, poſſeſſed with the gloomy Dread of Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, too naturally contracts his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as his Hopes of Happineſs decreaſe; while he conſiders and deſpiſeth himſelf, as no more than the Beaſts that periſh.</p>
               <p>THE noble Writer indeed inſinuates, that there is <q rend="inline">"a certain Narrowneſs of Spirit, occaſioned by this Regard to a future Life, peculiarly obſervable in the <hi>devout</hi> Perſons and <hi>Zealots</hi> of almoſt every reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Perſuaſion<note n="v" place="bottom">

'Tis allowed indeed, that the Pleaſures of Virtue are the higheſt we know of in our preſent State; and 'tis therefore commonly ſuppoſed, they may conſtitute our chief Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity in another.

               <p>THE Objection, indeed, carries an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Force: Yet on a near Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it entirely vaniſheth.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be owned, that in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, a conſiderable Part of what is called <hi>Religion,</hi> deſerves no other Name than that of <hi>Abſurdity</hi> made <hi>ſacred.</hi> And it were ſtrange indeed, ſhould <hi>Bigotry</hi> and <hi>falſe</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion produce that Uprightneſs of Heart, that Perfection of Morals, which is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Effect of <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT muſt be owned, that with Regard to religious Principle, as well as moral Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, every Man has the Power of being a <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> That Knaves, in order to be

accounted <hi>honeſt,</hi> may appear <hi>devout.</hi> And we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, if we conſider the innumerable Artifices of Villainy, that the outward Profeſſion of Religion becomes a frequent <hi>Diſguiſe</hi> to an <hi>atheiſtical</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi> Heart.</p>
               <p>BUT though theſe Circumſtances may ſufficiently account for the Appearance in many particular Caſes, yet, with Regard to the <hi>general</hi> Fact, <hi>here</hi> ſeems to lie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Solution of the Difficulty. <q rend="inline">"That even where true Religion is known, profeſſed, and in Speculation <hi>aſſented</hi> to, it is ſeldom ſo thoroughly <hi>inculcated</hi> as to become a Principle of Action."</q> We have ſeen that Imagination is the univerſal Inſtrument of human Action; that no Paſſion can be ſtrongly excited in the Soul by mere Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Aſſent, till the Imagination hath formed to itſelf ſome kind of Picture or Repreſentation of the Good or Evil appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended<note n="z" place="bottom">

                  </note>. Now the Senſes and their attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Paſſions are continually urging their Demands, through the immediate Preſence of their reſpective Objects: So that nothing but the <hi>vivid Image</hi> of ſome greater Good or Evil in Futurity can poſſibly reſiſt and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1167800100:237"/>
overbalance their Sollicitations. The <hi>Idea</hi> therefore of future Happineſs and Miſery muſt be ſtrongly impreſſed on the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ere they can work their full Effects, becauſe they are <hi>diſtant</hi> and <hi>unſeen:</hi> But this <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Reflexion</hi> is ſeldom properly fixed by <hi>Education;</hi> and thus for want of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Impreſſion, <q rend="inline">"religious Principle is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>gained,</hi> and therefore ſeldom ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT where a ſincere and lively Impreſſion takes Place; where the Mind is convinced of the Being of a GOD; that he <hi>is,</hi> and is a <hi>Rewarder</hi> of them that diligently ſeek him; where the <hi>Imagination</hi> hath gained a Habit of connecting this great Truth with every Thought, Word, and Action; there it may be juſtly affirmed, that Piety and Virtue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but <hi>prevail.</hi> To ſay, in a Caſe of this Nature, that Man will not act according to his Principle, is to contradict the full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of known Facts. We ſee how true Mankind commonly are to their Principle of <hi>Pride,</hi> or miſtaken Honour; how true to their Principle of <hi>Avarice,</hi> or miſtaken Intereſt; how true to their Principle, of a Regard to <hi>human</hi> Laws. Why are they ſo? Becauſe they have ſtrongly and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1167800100:238"/>
connected theſe Principles in their Imagination with the Idea of their own Happineſs. Therefore, whenever the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Principle becomes in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner habitually connected in the Imagination, with the Agent's Happineſs; that is, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the religious Principle takes Place at all, it muſt needs become infinitely more powerful than any other; becauſe the <hi>Good</hi> it promiſeth, and the <hi>Evil</hi> it threatens, are infinitely greater and more laſting. Hence it appears, that the Corruption of Mankind, even where the pureſt Religion is <hi>profeſſed,</hi> and in Theory <hi>aſſented</hi> to, doth not ariſe from the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of religious Principle, but the <hi>Want</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>AND indeed on other Occaſions, and to ſerve different Purpoſes, the noble Writer and his Partiſans can allow and give Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all that is here contended for. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo common among theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as to declaim againſt the terrible Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>prieſtly Power.</hi> 'Tis their favourite Topic, to repreſent Mankind as groaning under the Tyranny of the <hi>ſacred Order.</hi> Now what does this Repreſentation imply, but <q rend="inline">"the Force of religious Principle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly directed?"</q> If Mankind can be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1167800100:239"/>
ſwayed by religious Hope and Fear, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign their Paſſions and Intereſts to the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> or Advantage of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> why not to the <hi>Benefit</hi> of <hi>Mankind?</hi> 'Tis only impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a different Idea of <hi>Duty:</hi> The Motive to Action is in both Caſes the ſame, and conſequently muſt be of equal Efficacy. Thus if religious Principle were void of <hi>Force,</hi> the Prieſthood muſt be void of <hi>Power.</hi> The Influence therefore of the Prieſthood, however diſhoneſtly applied, is a Demonſtration of the Force of <hi>religious Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefore ſeems to be the Truth. Although, by timely and continued Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the religious Principle might be made more univerſally predominant; yet even as it is, though not ſo thoroughly inculcated as to become generally a conſiſtent Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Action; in Fact it hath a frequent and <hi>conſiderable,</hi> though <hi>partial</hi> and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Influence. None but the thoroughly Good and Bad act on continued or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent Principles; all the intermediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Good and Bad act at different Times on various and inconſiſtent Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; that is, their <hi>Imaginations</hi> are by turns given up to <hi>Impreſſions</hi> of a <hi>different,</hi> or
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1167800100:240"/>
even <hi>contrary</hi> Nature. This explains the whole Myſtery: For, hence it appears that the conſiſtent or inconſiſtent Conduct of Men depends not on the Nature of their Principles, but on having their Principles, whatever they are, <hi>counteracted</hi> by oppoſite ones. Although therefore, through a Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of timely Diſcipline, Numbers of Men appear to be of that capricious Temper as not to be ſteddy to any Principle, yet ſtill the religious one will <hi>mix</hi> with the reſt, and naturally <hi>prevail</hi> in its <hi>Turn.</hi> This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a common Circumſtance among the <hi>looſer</hi> and more <hi>inconſiderate</hi> Ranks of Men; who, although by no Means uniformly ſwayed by the Precepts of Religion, are yet frequently ſtruck with Horror at the Thought of Actions <hi>peculiarly</hi> vile, and deterred by the Apprehenſion of an all-ſeeing GOD from the Commiſſion of Crimes <hi>uncommonly atrocious.</hi>

               <p>HERE then lies the eſſential Difference between the Efficacy of <hi>Taſte,</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> Principle: That the firſt, being a Feeling or Perception diſpenſed in various Degrees, and in very weak ones to the Bulk of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is incapable, even through the moſt aſſiduous Culture, of becoming an univerſal
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1167800100:241"/>
or conſiſtent Motive to Virtue: But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Principle, ariſing from ſuch Paſſions as are common to the whole Species, muſt, if properly inculcated, <hi>univerſally</hi> prevail.</p>
               <p>'Tis evident therefore, that in the very firſt Dawns of Reaſon, religious Principles ought to be impreſſed on the Minds of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and this early Culture continued through the ſucceeding Stages of Life. But as the noble Writer hath ſtrangely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ridicule and diſhonour Religion in every Shape; ſo here, he hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to throw an Odium on this Method of religious Diſcipline, by repreſenting it as the Enemy to true Morals and practical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, as it fetters the Mind with early Prejudices. <q rend="inline">"Whatever Manner in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy happens to bear the leaſt Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to that of <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> cannot, I am perſuaded, of itſelf ſeem very inviting. Such a ſmart Way of queſtioning our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in our Youth, has made our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood more averſe to the <hi>expoſtulatory</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: And though the metaphyſical Points of our Belief, are by this Method with admirable Care and Caution inſtilled into tender Minds; yet the Manner of this <hi>anticipating</hi> Philoſophy may make

               <p>IN reply to this <hi>moſt philoſophical</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, let it be obſerved; that it is not the Deſign of Religion to make <hi>Sophiſts,</hi> but <hi>good Subjects</hi> of Mankind. That Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſigned, not for <hi>Speculation,</hi> but <hi>Action,</hi> religious Principle is not to be inſtilled in a <hi>philoſophical,</hi> but a <hi>moral</hi> View: Therefore with Regard to <hi>Practice,</hi> nothing can be more fit and rational than to impreſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>Truths</hi> at an Age when the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient</hi> is incapable of their <hi>Demonſtrations;</hi> in the ſame Manner as we teach the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic</hi>

to <hi>work</hi> on <hi>Geometric</hi> Principles, while the Proofs are <hi>unknown</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>BUT then, the <hi>Prejudices of Education</hi>—yes, theſe are the great <hi>Stumbling-block</hi> to a modern <hi>Free-thinker:</hi> It ſtill runs in his Head, that all Mankind are born to diſpute <hi>de omni ſcibili</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="bottom">On all Subjects.</note>. Let therefore this <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute</hi> Philoſopher reflect, firſt, that a <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> doth not imply, as is generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the <hi>Falſehood</hi> of the Opinion inſtilled; but only that it is taken up and held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its proper <hi>Evidence.</hi> Thus a Child may be prejudiced in Favour of Truth, as well as Falſehood; and in him neither the one nor the other can properly be called more than an <hi>Opinion.</hi> Further: The human Mind cannot remain in a State of <hi>Indifference,</hi> with regard either to <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Practice:</hi> 'Tis of an <hi>active</hi> Nature; and, like a <hi>fertile</hi> Field, if by due Cultivation it be not made to produce good <hi>Fruit,</hi> will certainly ſpring up in <hi>Tares</hi> and <hi>Thiſlles.</hi> Impreſſions, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, <hi>Prejudices,</hi> of one kind or other a Child will inevitably contract, from the Things and Perſons that <hi>ſurround</hi> him: And if rational Habits and Opinions be not infuſed, in order to <hi>anticipate</hi> Abſurdities;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1167800100:244"/>
Abſurdities will riſe, and <hi>anticipate</hi> all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Habits and Opinions.

                  <hi>Capacity</hi> of Improvement ſhould be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;</hi> and we muſt turn <hi>Savages,</hi> in order to be made perfect in the <hi>ſovereign Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS no difficult Matter therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether a Child ſhould be left to the Follies of his own <hi>weak</hi> Underſtanding and <hi>naſcent</hi> Paſſions; be left to imbibe the Maxims of corrupt Times and Manners; Maxims which, ſetting aſide all Regard to their ſpeculative Truth or Falſehood, do lead to certain Miſery; or, on the other hand, ſhall be happily conducted to embrace thoſe religious Principles, which have had the Approbation of the beſt and wiſeſt Men in every Age and Nation; and which are known and allowed to be the only Means of true Happineſs to Individuals, Families, and States.</p>
               <p>THIS therefore ought to be the early and principal Care of thoſe who have the Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Youth: And they will ſoon find the happy Effects of their Inſtruction. For as the Child's Underſtanding ſhall improve, what was at firſt inſtilled only as an <hi>Opinion,</hi> will by Degrees be embraced as <hi>Truth:</hi> Reaſon will then aſſume her juſt Empire; and the great, univerſal, religious Principle,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1167800100:246"/>
a rational Obedience to the Will of GOD, will raiſe him to his utmoſt Capacity of moral Perfection; will be a wide and firm Foundation, on which the whole Fabric of Virtue may riſe in its juſt Proportions; will <hi>extend</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> his <hi>Benevolence</hi> and <hi>moral Senſe;</hi> will ſtrengthen them, if weak; will confirm them, if ſtrong; will ſupply their Want, if naturally defective: In fine, will direct all his <hi>Paſſions</hi> to their proper <hi>Objects</hi> and <hi>Degrees;</hi> and, as the great <hi>Maſter-ſpring</hi> of Action, at once <hi>promote</hi> and <hi>regulate</hi> every Movement of his <hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT muſt be owned, the noble Writer's Caution againſt this <q rend="inline">"anticipating Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy"</q> hath of late been deeply imbibed. In Conſequence of it, we have ſeen <hi>religious Principle</hi> declaimed againſt, ridiculed, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. The Effect of this hath been, an abandoned Degree of Villainy in one Claſs of Mankind; a lethargic Indifference to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Virtue or Vice in another; and in the third, which boaſt the Height of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Virtue, we ſeldom ſee more than the firſt natural Efforts, the mere <hi>Buddings</hi> of Benevolence and Honour, which are too generally blaſted ere they can ripen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Action.</hi> This Contempt of Religion
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1167800100:247"/>
hath always been a fatal <hi>Omen</hi> to <hi>free</hi> States. Nor, if we may credit Experience, can we entertain any juſt Hope, that this fantaſtic Scheme, this boaſted <hi>Reliſh</hi> for Beauty and Virtue, can ever give Security to Empire, without the more ſolid Supports of religious Belief. For it is remarkable, that in the Decline of both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> States, after Religion had loſt its Credit and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, this very <hi>Taſte,</hi> this <hi>ſovereign Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> uſurped its Place, and became the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Study and Amuſement (as it is now among ourſelves) both of the <hi>Vile</hi> and <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> The Fact, with Regard to <hi>Greece,</hi> is ſufficiently notorious; with Regard to <hi>Rome,</hi> it may ſeem to demand a Proof. And who would think, that QUINTILIAN in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Paſſage was not deſcribing our own Age and Nation? <q rend="inline">"Nunc autem quae vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ut propria philoſophiae aſſeruntur, paſſim tractamus <hi>omnes:</hi> Quis enim modo de JUSTO, AEQUO, AC BONO, non et VIR PESSIMUS loquitur<note n="c" place="bottom">

this <hi>Leproſy</hi> of <hi>falſe</hi> Knowledge may end in, I am unwilling to ſay: But this may be ſaid with Truth, becauſe it is juſtified by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; that along with the Circumſtance now remarked, every other <hi>Symptom</hi> is riſing among us, that hath generally attended the dark and troubled <hi>Evening</hi> of a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DOUBTLESS, many will treat theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions with <hi>Deriſion:</hi> But this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion</hi> is far from being an Evidence of their Falſehood. For no People ever fell a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to themſelves, till <hi>lulled</hi> and infatuated by their own Paſſions. <hi>Blind Security</hi> is an eſſential Characteriſtic of a People devoted to Deſtruction. The Fact is equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, whether it ariſeth from the moral Appointment of Providence, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of natural Cauſes. Though this is ſeen and acknowledged by thoſe who are converſant with the Hiſtory of Mankind; yet 'tis hard to convey this Evidence to thoſe who ſeldom extend their Views beyond their own ſhort Period of Exiſtence; becauſe they ſee the Prevalence of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> aſſigned, while yet the pretended <hi>Conſequence</hi> appears not. But they who look back into ancient Time are convinced, that the <hi>public</hi> Effects
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1167800100:249"/>
of <hi>Irreligion</hi> have never been ſudden or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate.</hi> One Age is <hi>falſely</hi> polite, <hi>irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> and <hi>vile;</hi> the next is ſunk in <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> and <hi>Wretchedneſs.</hi> This is analogous to the Operation of other Cauſes. A Man may be intemperate for twenty Years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he feels the Effects of Intemperance on his Conſtitution. The Sun and Moon raiſe the Tides; yet the Tides riſe not to their Height, till a conſiderable Time after the Conjunction of theſe two Luminaries. We cannot therefore juſtly decide concerning the future <hi>Effects</hi> of Irreligion, from its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State. The <hi>Examples</hi> of former Times are a much better <hi>Criterion:</hi> And theſe are ſuch, as ought to make every Man among us, that regards Poſterity, tremble for his Poſterity while he reads them.</p>
               <p>FOR this is but too juſt an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the Story of Mankind. That TYRANNY and SUPERSTITION have ever gone Hand in Hand; mutually ſupporting and ſupported; taking their Progreſs, and fixing their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all the Kingdoms of the Earth; overwhelming it in one general Deluge, as the Waters cover the Sea. Here and there a happy Nation <hi>emerges;</hi> breathes for a while in the enlightened Region of KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE,

               <p>POSSIBLY the fatal Blow may yet be averted from us. 'Tis ſurely the Duty of every Man, in every Station, to contribute his Share, however <hi>inconſiderable,</hi> to this great End.

the Way of <hi>Chat, Raillery, Innuendo,</hi> or <hi>Story-telling:</hi> In a Word, that very Species of the preſent modiſh Compoſition, which he ſo contemptuouſly ridicules; <q rend="inline">"where, as he tells us, Juſtneſs and Accuracy of Thought are ſet aſide as too conſtraining; where Grounds and Foundations are of no Moment; and which hath properly neither <hi>Top</hi> nor <hi>Bottom, Beginning</hi> nor <hi>End</hi>

In his Critical Progreſs, he had treated this <hi>diſhabille</hi> of Compoſition, as the Man in the Fable did his Pears; uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious he ſhould be ever afterwards reduced to diet on them himſelf. The Truth of the Matter is, that the broken Hints, the ambiguous Expreſſion, and the Ludicro-ſerious of the gentle Eſſayiſt, perfectly ſecure him from the rough Handling of the Logical-Diſputer.</p>
               <p>INDEED the noble Author has a double Advantage from this <hi>Cloud,</hi> in which the <hi>Graces</hi> ſo frequently ſecure their Favourite. He not only eludes the Force of every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the Defenders of Chriſtianity alledge in it's Support, but even pleads the Privilege of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1167800100:253"/>
being ranked in the Number of <hi>ſincere</hi> Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. He takes frequent Occaſions of expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Abhorrence of <hi>idle Scepticks</hi> and <hi>wicked Unbelievers</hi> in Religion: He declares himſelf of a more reſigned Underſtanding, a ductile Faith, ready to be moulded into any Shape that his ſpiritual Superiors ſhall preſcribe. At other Times, and in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Places, he ſcatters ſuch Inſinuations againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and that too with all the Bitterneſs of <hi>Sarcaſm</hi> and <hi>Invective,</hi> as muſt needs be more effectual in promoting <hi>Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> than a formal and avowed Accuſation. For in the Way of open War, there is fair Warning given to put Reaſon upon Guard, that no pretending Argument be ſuffered to paſs without Examination. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the noble Writer's concealed Method of <hi>Raillery,</hi> ſteals inſenſibly on his Reader; fills him with endleſs Prejudice and Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion; and, without paſſing thro' the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſixeth ſuch Impreſſions on the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as <hi>Reaſon,</hi> with all its Effects, will be hardly able afterwards to efface.</p>
               <p>THESE inconſiſtent Circumſtances in his Lordſhip's Conduct, have made it a Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among ſome, what his real Sentiments were concerning Religion and <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:1167800100:254"/>
If it be neceſſary to decide this Queſtion, we may obſerve, that a diſguiſed Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may have his Reaſons for making a formal Declaration of his Aſſent to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of his Country: But it will be hard to find what ſhould tempt a real <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to load <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> with Scorn and <hi>Infamy.</hi> Indeed, the noble Writer, to do him Juſtice, never deſigned to leave us at a Loſs on this Subject. For he hath been ſo good, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to remind his Reader, to <hi>look out</hi> for the true Drift of his <hi>Irony,</hi> leſt his real Meaning ſhould be miſtaken or diſregarded.</p>
               <p>HERE then lies the Force of his Lordſhip's Attack on <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi>

               <p>'TIS obſervable therefore, Firſt, that his Lordſhip, in other Places, allows that <q rend="inline">"If there be naturally ſuch a Paſſion as Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, 'tis evident, that Religion itſelf is of the Kind, and muſt be therefore natural to Man<note n="m" place="bottom">

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1167800100:259"/>
whether the noble Writer be in <hi>Jeſt</hi> or <hi>Earneſt,</hi> the Argument he hints at is plainly this: That if we look round the Works of Nature, we ſhall find an Analogy eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſeems a Proof, that this natural Fear which <hi>preſſeth</hi> ſo univerſally on the human Mind, hath a real and proportioned Object. The Argument hath been urged by many of great Name, in Favour of the <hi>Hope</hi> of future <hi>Good;</hi> and 'tis ſurely of equal Force, whatever that Force may be, when apply'd to the <hi>Fear</hi> of future <hi>Ill.</hi> For we ſee thro' the whole Creation, every Animal of whatever Species, directed by it's Nature or the Hand of Providence, to fear and ſhun it's proper and appointed Enemy. We find theſe Apprehenſions univerſally ſuited to the Nature and Preſervation of every Species among Birds, Beaſts, Fiſhes, Inſects. Nor is there one <hi>Fear,</hi> tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>exceſſive</hi> in it's <hi>Degree,</hi> that is <hi>erroneous</hi> with Regard to it's <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>religious Fear,</hi> therefore, which <hi>forceth itſelf</hi> ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally on the human Mind, in every Age and Nation, ignorant or knowing, civilized or barbarous; hath <hi>probably</hi> an Object ſuited to it's Nature, ordained for the Welfare of the human Species. At leaſt, this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1167800100:260"/>
muſt ever be of Weight with thoſe, who draw their Ideas of future Exiſtence from the <hi>Inſtincts, Hopes,</hi> and <hi>Expectations</hi> of the human Mind.</p>
               <p>INDEED, on the noble Writer's refined Scheme of Morals, in which the natural Affections of the Mind are repreſented, as all-ſufficient for the Purpoſes of human Happineſs, this Argument muſt loſe it's Force; becauſe, on this Suppoſition, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Fear is <hi>ſupernumerary</hi> and <hi>uſeleſs:</hi> But then this ſhews the Suppoſition itſelf to be <hi>monſtrous, abſurd,</hi> and contrary to the eſtabliſhed Courſe of Nature; becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives no Power or Paſſion, but to ſome proper and appointed End: The very <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi> of the Paſſion, therefore, is a Proof of it's Neceſſity.</p>
               <p>NOW, if indeed the religious Fear be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as, we preſume, hath been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved in the preceding Eſſay; then, from hence will ariſe a ſtrong and convincing Proof, that the Object of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fear is <hi>real.</hi> For we find thro' the whole Extent of created Being, that the Author of Nature hath annexed to all his Deſigns and Purpoſes, the proper Means or Objects, by which they may be fulfilled.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1167800100:261"/>
As therefore the religious Fear is not only interwoven with the Frame of Man, but <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to his <hi>Happineſs,</hi> it's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject muſt be <hi>real;</hi> becauſe, if <hi>not,</hi> you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Creator to have given a NECESSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY <hi>Paſſion,</hi> without it's <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>appointed Object;</hi> which would be a Contradiction to the <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>known Conſtitution</hi> of Things.</p>
               <p>ON this Occaſion, we may obſerve the Weakneſs of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Syſtem, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Providence:</hi> For that Sect hath ever deny'd, that the Deity concerns himſelf with the <hi>moral</hi> Conduct of Man. But from the wiſe and benevolent Conſtitution of the natural World itſelf, a ſtrong Proof ariſeth in Support of GOD's <hi>moral</hi> Government of it, and of the Truth of the <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations</hi> of the human Mind. For if we allow that he regards and preſerves the natural Order and Symmetry of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that he hath formed this immenſe Syſtem of Being, and ſecured it's Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Welfare, by certain Laws, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Happineſs of his Creatures; then we muſt on the ſame Foundation conclude, that he hath likewiſe eſtabliſhed ſuch <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Action,</hi> as may determine
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1167800100:262"/>
                  <hi>Man</hi> to proſecute the ſame End. It were an Imputation on the Wiſdom of the Deity, to conceive him as <hi>doing</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> the <hi>other:</hi> Unleſs <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Morals</hi> be leſs worthy of his Regard, than <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>

HERE, as his Lordſhip drags us into the <hi>beaten Track</hi> of <hi>Controverſy,</hi> the beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment that can be paid the Reader, is to carry him thro' it by the ſhorteſt Way.

               <p>HOWEVER, for the Satisfaction of thoſe who may think it neceſſary, a ſummary View of the Evidence is here ſubjoined,</p>
               <p>THE Authenticity, therefore, of the Books of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> appears to be founded on the ſtrongeſt moral Evidence, becauſe from the earlieſt Ages, we find them aſcribed to the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, whoſe Names they bear. Thus St PAUL's Epiſtles are mentioned by St. PETER, and cited by CLEMENS ROMANUS, who lived in the Reign of CLAUDIUS, even before St PAUL was carried Priſoner to ROME. PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LYCARP and IRENAEUS were for ſome Time contemporary with St. JOHN: They both cite
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1167800100:274"/>
the four Goſpels, and affirm they were all wrote by the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, whoſe Names they bear. JUSTIN MARTYR and CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS, confirm their Accounts in the following Century: And the great ORIGEN, with whom I ſhall cloſe the Catalogue, and who lived in the Reign of SEVERUS, in his Book againſt CELSUS hath cited <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> and <hi>moſt,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> under the Names they now bear: And the Words of the ſeveral Citations per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agree with thoſe of the new Teſtament, now in Uſe. Such a full Proof of the Genuineneſs of theſe ſacred Records, as is not to be parallel'd, concerning any other Book, of <hi>equal</hi> or even of much <hi>leſs Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>internal</hi> Proof of their Genuineneſs, ariſing from their <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Compoſition,</hi> is no leſs eminent and particular. The Genius of every Book, is ſo perfectly agreeable to the Character and Education of it's reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Author; every Cuſtom deſcribed or alluded to, either <hi>Jewiſh, Greek,</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> ſo entirely ſuited to the <hi>Times;</hi> every Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſo <hi>natural,</hi> ſo <hi>occaſional,</hi> ſo <hi>particular,</hi> ſo perfectly <hi>identify'd,</hi> that it were the very
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1167800100:275"/>
extreme of Ignorance and Folly, to raiſe a Doubt on this Subject.</p>
               <p>THAT the Goſpel-Hiſtory hath been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us, <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>uncorrupted,</hi> we have no leſs Reaſon to believe. 'Tis well known how zealous the primitive Chriſtians were in the Preſervation of the Scriptures: We know, they regarded them as their chief and deareſt Treaſure; and often laid down their Lives, rather than deliver the ſacred Records to their Enemies, who uſed every Art of Terror, to ſeize and deſtroy them. Again, the Scriptures were not then locked up from the Laity, as now in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: But Copies were taken, diſperſed, and became immenſely numerous. They were univerſally read at the Times of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip, in different Nations of the World. To this we may add, that as <hi>now,</hi> ſo <hi>then,</hi> different Sects and Parties ſubſiſted, who all appealed to Scripture for Proof of their ſeveral Opinions; and theſe, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, muſt have been ſo many <hi>Checks</hi> upon each other, to the general Excluſion of Miſtake and Fraud<note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <p>The JEWS and SAMARITANS were <hi>Checks</hi> upon each other in the ſame Manner, for the Preſervation of the Purity of the <hi>Pentatouch.</hi> The <hi>Samaritan Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch</hi> was printed in the laſt Century: And, <q rend="inline">"after <hi>Two thouſand Years</hi> Diſcord between the Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, varies as little from the other, as any <hi>Claſſic</hi> Author in leſs Tract of Time has diſagreed from it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by the <hi>unavoidable Miſtakes</hi> of ſo many <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers.</hi>"</q>

THIS being the real State of the Caſe; let us now conſider the noble Writer's Queſtions. He aſks, whether by Scripture be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <q rend="inline">"the apocryphal or more canonical? the full or half-authorized? the doubtful or the certain? the controverted or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted?"</q> Theſe Queſtions are nearly ſynonymous, and one ſhort Reply will clear them all. There are many Books, concerning which there never was <hi>any Doubt.</hi> There are ſome, concerning which the Doubts have been fully <hi>cleared up.</hi> There are others, concerning which the Doubts have been <hi>confirmed.</hi> Of the firſt Kind are <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> and <hi>moſt</hi> of the <hi>Epiſtles:</hi> Of the ſecond, are the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> of <hi>Peter, ſecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> that of <hi>Jude,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe:</hi> Of the third Kind, are the <hi>apocryphal</hi> Books; therefore indeed ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>THE noble Author goes on. <q rend="inline">"The <hi>ſingle</hi> read, or that of <hi>various</hi> Reading?"</q>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:1167800100:277"/>
My Lord, if by ſingle read you mean a Book in which there are no various Readings, there are none <hi>ſingle read:</hi> Nor, probably, was there ever any Book <hi>ſingle read,</hi> that went thro' more than one Edition: at leaſt, before the Invention of <hi>Printing.</hi> And as the Scriptures were oftener tranſcribed than any other Book, ſo, a greater Variety of of Readings muſt naturally take Place. But I muſt inform your Lordſhip, from the learned PHILELEUTHERUS LIPSIENSIS, that this is the moſt illiterate of all Cavils: For that in Fact, we have the <hi>Senſe</hi> of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors moſt <hi>entire,</hi> where the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Readings are moſt numerous: As, of thoſe Authors where the Varieties are <hi>few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> the Senſe is moſt mutilated or obſcure<note n="i" place="bottom">For a full View of this Argument, <bibl>See <hi>Phil. Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſienſ.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </note>. But if by <hi>ſingle read,</hi> your Lordſhip means an authentic Text collected and compoſed out of the various Readings, I beg leave to inform you, there is no ſuch in the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Churches. They have been too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to attempt any ſuch Thing. Nor does the <hi>Truth</hi> ſuffer by it: For as the learned Critic, juſt before quoted, obſerves, the moſt faulty Copy of the new Teſtament now in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1167800100:278"/>
being, does not obſcure one moral Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or one Article of Faith.</p>
               <p>AGAIN the noble Writer goes on, in a Profuſion of ſynonymous Terms: <q rend="inline">"The Tranſcripts, Copies, Titles, Catalogues, of this Church or that? of this Sect or Party, or another? of thoſe in one Age called orthodox, or thoſe who in another Age overthrew them?"</q> What unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Perſon would not imagine from hence, that <hi>different</hi> Churches, Sects, or Parties, had <hi>each</hi> of them a Bible different from the reſt? Yet 'tis certain, that however theſe Parties differed in Opinions, we find from their Writings now ſubſiſting, that they all appealed to one common Scripture for their Support.</p>
               <p>THE noble Writer takes his Leave by paying a Compliment to theſe primitive Writers called the Fathers of the Church. <q rend="inline">"How theſe ſacred Records were <hi>guarded</hi> in thoſe Ages, might be eaſily <hi>imagined,</hi>" &amp;c.</q>—But to <hi>imagine,</hi> is a much eaſier Taſk than to <hi>prove;</hi> eſpecially when Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is helped forward by Inclination. <hi>Guarded</hi> indeed they were, as we have ſeen, from Interpolation and Falſhood. But if he means to inſinuate, that they were <hi>guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:1167800100:279"/>
from <hi>Inſpection</hi> and <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> he does great Injuſtice to Chriſtianity. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Marks of ſecular Views may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Conduct of the ancient Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in the ſucceeding Ages, we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bid Defiance to the noble Writer's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, to ſhew any thing of this Kind in the Characters of thoſe to whoſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we have here appealed; and on whoſe Teſtimony, joined to that of their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ingenuous Contemporaries, the Authenticity of the Goſpel-Hiſtory depends. They were far from acting or writing with a View to temporal Advantage; they were ſtruggling under the Weight of heavy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions; had no Motives to preach or write, but the great Expectation of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hereafter, founded on a firm Belief of that holy Religion, which they propagated with an Effect <hi>almoſt,</hi> if not <hi>indeed, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ON this Occaſion I cannot but obſerve a ſtrange Inſinuation thrown out elſewhere by the noble Writer; which, however, is ſo glaring a Falſhood, that he finds himſelf obliged to diſavow it, even while he labours to impreſs it on his Reader's Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in all the Colours of Eloquence. <q rend="inline">"If,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1167800100:280"/>
ſaies he, the collateral Teſtimony of other ancient Records were deſtroyed, there would be leſs Argument or Plea remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt that natural Suſpicion of thoſe who are called Sceptical, that the holy Records themſelves were no other than the pure Invention or artificial Compile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an intereſted Party, in Behalf of the <hi>richeſt Corporation,</hi> and moſt <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Monopoly</hi> in the World<note n="k" place="bottom">

performed in Atteſtation of any <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Doctrine,</hi> (which hath been the general Way of treating this Queſtion) 'tis my Deſign to conſider as one Object, <q rend="inline">"that vaſt <hi>Series</hi> and <hi>Concatenation</hi> of miraculous Acts, recorded in the Old and New Teſtament, wrought thro' a long Succeſſion of Ages, for the <hi>carrying on, Support,</hi> and <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Diſpenſation.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>WITH this View therefore let us firſt conſider the means by which Mankind are juſtly convinced of the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God.</hi> Now this Conviction, 'tis allowed by all, ariſeth from a <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Power, Wiſdom,</hi> ann <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> diſplayed in the viſible Creation.

Hence then alone we obtain the Idea of a <hi>Divinity,</hi> from a <hi>Union</hi> of perfect <hi>Goodneſs, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

'TIS likewiſe, I think, acknowledged by all <hi>Theiſts,</hi> that, as to the divine Power, it may work it's Intentions, either by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and uninterrupted Superintendency, or Agency on Matter, or by impreſſing certain original and permanent Qualities upon it. Which of theſe two Kinds of Operation may really prevail in Nature, is perhaps beyond the Reach of human Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, clearly to determine. The <hi>Newto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Philoſophy indeed renders it highly probable, that the <hi>continued Agency</hi> of <hi>God</hi> prevails. But a Determination in this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is indeed of no Conſequence; ſince, which ſoever of theſe Methods be ordained, the <hi>divine Power</hi> is equally diſplay'd, while it miniſters to the Ends of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS equally plain, that, if the divine Goodneſs ſhould determine to raiſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to <hi>higher Degrees</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> than what they could attain to by the pre-eſtabliſhed Laws of Nature; or to free them from <hi>Defects</hi> and <hi>Miſeries,</hi> occaſioned by any incidental and <hi>voluntary</hi> Corruptions, <hi>poſterior</hi> to their <hi>Creation;</hi> 'tis equally plain, I ſay, that an Exertion of <hi>ſupernatural Power</hi> for the Accompliſhment
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1167800100:286"/>
of <hi>this End,</hi> would be a <hi>Diſplay, Proof,</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> entirely ſimilar to that which ariſes from the Works of Nature. For both <hi>here,</hi> and in the Works of <hi>Nature,</hi> the Proof of the Divinity ariſeth, not from mere uniform Acts of Power, but from the <hi>Subſerviency</hi> of divine <hi>Power</hi> to this one great End, the <hi>Production</hi> of human <hi>Happineſs.</hi> Here then, the noble Writer's Objection is eſſentially defective: What he affirms is either <hi>falſe,</hi> or <hi>foreign</hi> to the Queſtion. For if we ſuppoſe (and the preſent Queſtion is put upon this Footing only) that the miraculous or ſupernatural Effects are evidently ſubſervient to ſimilar Ends of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> as appear in the Works of the Creation; then ſure, we have equal Reaſon to conclude, and be convinced, that they are the Effects of <hi>one</hi> Power;—of one <hi>ſuperior</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi> Power;—of one Power, <hi>wiſe, juſt,</hi> and <hi>good;</hi>—In a Word, of that Power which firſt brought Nature into Being, eſtabliſhed Laws for the Welfare of his Creatures; and when the Happineſs of his Creatures requires an Interpoſition, gives ſtill further Evidences of his <hi>Goodneſs, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence,</hi>

by controuling thoſe Laws which himſelf had eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>LET us now apply theſe Principles to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſpenſation. <q rend="inline">"This, we ſay, was a Scheme of Providence, which ſtill continues operating; whereby the Deity determined to raiſe fallen and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Man to higher Degrees of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Virtue,</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> than what by Nature he could have attained."</q> In this Deſign, the <hi>divine</hi> GOODNESS is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently diſplay'd.</p>

On this Account the immediate Exertion of divine Power was neceſſary for it's <hi>Proof, Support,</hi> and <hi>Completion.</hi> Accordingly, we find it's om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Author, carrying on this Scheme of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> with a <hi>mighty Hand,</hi> and an <hi>out-ſtretched Arm.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>HRRE then we ſee, that this mighty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of miraculous Acts recorded in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> being <hi>the very Means</hi> of <hi>preſerving</hi> and <hi>ſeparating</hi> the ISRAELITES from the <hi>reſt</hi> of Mankind, and at the ſame time deſigned to <hi>impreſs</hi> them with a <hi>laſting Idea</hi> of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable and <hi>immediate Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> were generally <hi>awakening</hi> Inſtances of <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence,</hi> often of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Terror,</hi> in the Puniſhment of <hi>cruel</hi> EGYPTIANS, <hi>rebellious</hi> JEWS, and <hi>idolatrous Nations.</hi>

                  <hi>of Time</hi> was come, in which the Wiſdom of the Deity ordained the immediate Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Religion of perfect <hi>Purity</hi> and boundleſs <hi>Love.</hi> Accordingly, the Series of miraculous Acts wrought for this great End, were ſuch as muſt naturally <hi>engage</hi> Mankind to a <hi>favourable Reception</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> were the very <hi>Image</hi> and Tranſcript, expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the very <hi>Genius</hi> of that moſt <hi>aimable</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they were brought to <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh;</hi> in a Word, were continued Inſtances of <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> joined with <hi>unbounded Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> divine <hi>Compaſſion</hi> and <hi>Benevolence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Birth of JESUS was proclaimed by a glorious Apparition of ſuperior Beings, who declared the End of his coming in that divine Song of Triumph, <q rend="inline">"Glory to God in the higheſt, and on Earth Peace, Good Will towards Men!"</q> His Life was one continued Scene of divine Power, Wiſdom, and Beneficence. He gave Eyes to the Blind; Ears to the Deaf; and Feet to the Lame: He raiſed the Dead to Life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the raging Elements, and made the Winds and Seas obey him. When to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Decrees of Heaven, and complete the great Work of Man's Redemption, he ſubmitted to an ignominious Death, the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1167800100:292"/>
Vail of the Temple was rent in twain: A general Darkneſs involved, and an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake ſhook, the City. The ſame Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence by which he wrought his Miracles, raiſed him from the Grave; and after a ſhort ſtay on Earth, during which he ſtrengthened and confirmed his deſponding Followers, tranſlated him to Heaven. And now, a new and <hi>unexpected</hi> Scene of divine and miraculous Power opened on Mankind, for the full Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> The Spirit of God came down, and dwelt with the Apoſtles; they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſpake with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them Utterance. They were inveſted with ſupernatural Power to heal Diſeaſes; were impowered to ſtrike dead the deceitful ANANIAS and SAPPHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA; and when impriſoned, were delivered by the immediate Hand of GOD. By theſe Means, Chriſtianity gained a numerous Train of Proſelytes among the JEWS; but the great Work of converting the Gentiles was not yet begun. To this End the Apoſtle PAUL was deſtined; and converted to Chriſtianity by an amazing Act of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and divine Power. In this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Miniſtry he was frequently preſerved
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1167800100:293"/>
by the miraculous Care of Providence; did himſelf perform ſtupendous Acts of Power and Beneficence; by theſe Means convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Multitudes among the Gentiles, and planting Chriſtianity in the moſt knowing and poliſhed Nations of the Earth.</p>
               <p>TO this irreſiſtible Chain of Evidence, ariſing from the miraculous Exertion of divine Power, we may add another <hi>collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Proof, ariſing from the <hi>miraculous</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anations of divine <hi>Fore-knowledge,</hi> recorded in the Bible, and delivered in PROPHECY thro' a Series of Ages, all <hi>centering</hi> in the ſame Point, the foretelling the <hi>Completion</hi> of this immenſe Plan of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Theſe <hi>Predictions</hi> were fulfilled in the Advent, Life, Death, and Reſurrection of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> who himſelf foretold the Succeſs of his Apoſtles among the Gentiles, and the final Diſſolution of the Jewiſh Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. This came to paſs in the Deſtruction of the <hi>Temple:</hi> And when a bitter Enemy to Chriſtianity attempted to make void the Decrees of Heaven in rebuilding this <hi>Temple,</hi> (the only Circumſtance of Union that could ever make the JEWS <hi>once more a People</hi>) the very Foundations were rent in Pieces by an
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:1167800100:294"/>
Earthquake, and the mad Aſſailants againſt <hi>Omnipotence</hi> buryed in the Ruins.</p>
               <p>FROM this mighty <hi>Union,</hi> therefore, ariſeth a Proof ſimilar to that which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the Works of Nature. For as in <hi>theſe</hi> we ſee the Happineſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>intended, plann'd,</hi> and <hi>produced,</hi> and from hence diſcover the Agency of the Deity: So in the Progreſs and Completion of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> we find a parallel Diſplay of the divine Attributes: We ſee the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Man's Happineſs <hi>determined</hi> by divine GOODNESS, <hi>plann'd</hi> by divine WIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM, <hi>foretold</hi> by divine KNOWLEDGE, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed</hi> by divine POWER: and hence, as in <hi>Nature,</hi> obtain a full <hi>Manifeſtation, Proof,</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> of the DEITY.</p>
               <p>AS this ſeems to be the true Light, in which the Evidence ariſing from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Miracles ought to be placed, it may be proper now to add a few Obſervations on what hath been offered on this Subject, both by the <hi>Defenders</hi> and the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. AS to the Degree of Proof or Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ariſing from a <hi>ſingle Miracle</hi> in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any <hi>particular Doctrine;</hi> whatever Force it may carry, 'tis a Point, which we
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1167800100:295"/>
are by no Means at preſent concerned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: Becauſe, as we have ſeen, in the Progreſs of the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, there is a vaſt <hi>Series</hi> or <hi>Chain,</hi> all <hi>uniting</hi> in one common End. It might be conſidered, in the ſame Manner, by thoſe who write in Proof of the Being of a God, <q rend="inline">"What Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Being would ariſe from a ſingle <hi>Vegetable</hi> or <hi>Animal,</hi> unconnected with the reſt of the Creation."</q> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſatisfying a ſingle Fact of this Kind may be to impartial Minds, it were ſurely weak to argue on this Foundation <hi>only,</hi> while we can appeal to that mighty <hi>Union of Deſign</hi> which appears in the Works of Nature. It ſhould therefore ſeem, that the Defenders of Chriſtianity have generally ſet this Evidence in too <hi>detached</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> a Light: For tho' the Proof ariſing from a ſingle Miracle, in Support of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrine may be of ſufficient Force to convince an equitable Mind; yet ſure, 'tis infinitely ſtronger and more ſatisfactory, if we <hi>view at once</hi> the whole <hi>Chain</hi> of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, by which the great Scheme of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> was propagated, as <hi>one</hi> vaſt <hi>Object:</hi> Becauſe in this View, we diſcover innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Circumſtances of <hi>mutual Relation</hi> and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1167800100:296"/>
                  <hi>Agreement,</hi> ſimilar to thoſe which are Proofs of <hi>final Cauſes</hi> in the natural World: In a Word, we diſcover that <hi>Union of Deſign,</hi> that Concurrence of infinite <hi>Goodneſs, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which is the ſure Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. IF in a Diſpenſation thus proved to be from God by all theſe concurring Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures of Divinity, any <hi>incidental Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> ſhould be found, which are <hi>unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable</hi> to <hi>human Reaſon;</hi> 'tis the Part of human Reaſon to <hi>acquieſce</hi> in this <hi>myſterious</hi> and <hi>unknown</hi> Part, from what is <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>known.</hi> Becauſe in a Syſtem or Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion planned by <hi>infinite</hi> Wiſdom, there <hi>muſt</hi> of Neceſſity be ſomething which <hi>finite</hi> Wiſdom cannot comprehend.

               <p n="9">IX. BUT on the Evidence as here ſtated, the Scripture Miracles become even <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> from the Circumſtances under which they are recorded.

               <p n="10">X. AND now we ſhall plainly ſee the Reaſon why we reject the Accounts of Miracles given by Heathen Writers, while we believe the other Parts of their Story; and yet cannot reject the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>

Miracles, without rejecting at the ſame Time the whole Hiſtory in which they are contained. For in the firſt Caſe, as the Miracles are <hi>uſeleſs, unmeaning,</hi> and <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected</hi> with the reſt of the Facts, it appears they are merely political. But the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Miracles make an eſſential Part of the ſeveral Events related; they are ſtrongly connected with this great HIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORY <hi>of</hi> PROVIDENCE, and are indeed <hi>the very Means</hi> by which <hi>Providence</hi> completed it's gracious <hi>Purpoſe,</hi>

               <p>HAVING vindicated the Scripture <hi>Miracles</hi> from the noble Writer's Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and ſhewn that they are ſo far from being <hi>uſeleſs</hi> or <hi>abſurd,</hi> that the grand Scheme of Providence could neither have been <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced</hi> nor <hi>accompliſhed</hi> without them; we have deſtroyed the chief Foundation on which his Lordſhip hath attempted to fix his Cavils againſt Chriſtianity on another Subject; I mean, that of <hi>Enthuſiaſm;</hi> which naturally offers itſelf next to our Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As this is the noble Writer's favourite Topic, we may reaſonably expect to ſee him ſhine in it: And in one Reſpect indeed he does. He never touches on the Subject, but he riſeth above himſelf: His Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation kindles; he catches the Fire he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes; and his Page glows with all the Ardors of this high Paſſion.</p>
               <p>IT will, I preſume, be unneceſſary to make any Remarks on the large and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Liſt of <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> Poets, Orators, Heroes, Legiſlators, Muſicians, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1167800100:305"/>
which his Lordſhip cites from PLATO. He may call them <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> if it ſeem good to him; and may juſtly rank himſelf in the Number too, if by that Name be underſtood no more, than a Man of uncommon Strength or Warmth of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for this indeed is the requiſite Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Excellence, in any of the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters here enumerated.</p>
               <p>THE only Circumſtance we are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>calmly</hi> to examine, is that of <hi>religious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm:</hi> Chiefly, to point out the eſſential Qualities and Characteriſtics which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh <hi>this</hi> from <hi>divine Inſpiration:</hi> Hence to prove, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were not <hi>religious Enthuſiaſts,</hi> as the noble Writer hath ſuggeſted.</p>
               <p>'TIS indeed, as his Lordſhip obſerves, <q rend="inline">"a great Work to judge of Spirits, whether they be of God."</q> We ſhall willingly join him in this Principle too, <q rend="inline">"that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this End, we muſt antecedently judge our own Spirit, whether it be of Reaſon or ſound Senſe, free of every byaſſing Paſſion, every giddy Vapour, or melancholy Fume. This is the firſt Knowledge, and previous Judgment; to underſtand ourſelves, and know what
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:1167800100:306"/>
Spirit we are of. Afterwards we may judge the Spirit in others, conſider what their perſonal Merit is, and prove the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of their Teſtimony by the Solidity of their Brain."</q> On this Principle then let the Cauſe be determined.</p>
               <p>IN examining this Subject, therefore, we ſhall find, Firſt, that in <hi>ſome</hi> Reſpects, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm</hi> muſt, from it's Nature, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble <hi>divine Inſpiration.</hi> Secondly, that in others it hath generally attempted a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſemblance, but hath always betrayed itſelf. Thirdly, that in other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it is diametrically oppoſite to divine Inſpiration, and void even of all ſeeming Reſemblance.</p>
               <p>FIRST, <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> muſt, from it's very Nature, in ſome Reſpects always reſemble divine <hi>Inſpiration.</hi> They both have the <hi>Deity</hi> for their Object; and conſequently muſt both be attended with a devout Turn of Mind. They muſt both be ſubject to ſtrong and unuſual Impreſſions; the one <hi>ſupernatural;</hi> the other <hi>praeternatural,</hi> that is, beyond the ordinary Efforts of Nature, tho' really produced by Nature; <hi>theſe,</hi> thro' their uncommon Force, will often reſemble, and not eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from <hi>thoſe</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:1167800100:307"/>
which are the real Effect of <hi>ſupernatural</hi> Power. This Circumſtance deſerves a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Attention: For theſe two Qualities which are common to both, have induced many to reject the very Notion of divine Inſpiration, as mere Ethuſiaſm. Whereas we ſee, that, ſuppoſing ſuch a thing as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> it cannot but reſemble <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm</hi> in theſe two Characters.</p>
               <p>BUT tho' it were ſtrange, if <hi>Counterfeits</hi> did not hit off ſome Features of their genuine <hi>Originals;</hi> yet it were more ſtrange, if they ſhould be able to adopt them all, by ſuch a perfect Imitation as to prevent their being detected.</p>
               <p>THERE are, therefore, ſecondly, other Circumſtances in which <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> hath generally attempted a further Reſemblance of divine <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> but in theſe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways betrayed itſelf <hi>ſpurious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of this Kind is, <q rend="inline">"A Pretence to, and Perſuaſion of the Power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Miracles.</hi>"</q> This Perſuaſion muſt needs be natural to the Enthuſiaſt; becauſe he imagines himſelf in all things highly favoured of Heaven: The Notion of a Communication of <hi>divine Power</hi> will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be among the chief of his <hi>Deliriums.</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:1167800100:308"/>
In this the Enthuſiaſt hath been detected, <hi>ſometimes</hi> by the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of the Miracle attempted, <hi>always</hi> by his <hi>Inability</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he propoſed. There is ſcarce an <hi>Abſurdity</hi> ſo great, but what hath ſome Time or other been aimed at by Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, in the Way of miraculous Power. Their Attempts have ever been void of all <hi>rational Intention,</hi> void of <hi>Beneficence,</hi> void of <hi>common Diſcernment:</hi> And hence mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly the Effects of a heated Imagination. That they have always failed in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts is no leſs known. But theſe are Truths ſo willingly allowed by the Enemies of Religion, that we need not enlarge on them. On the contrary, we have ſeen, the Miracles of the Goſpel are <hi>rational, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent, united</hi> in one great <hi>End;</hi> perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before <hi>Numbers,</hi> before <hi>Enemies;</hi> record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Eye-Witneſſes.</hi> His Lordſhip indeed objects or inſinuates, that the Teſtimony even of Eye-Witneſſes cannot in this Caſe be a Foundation for Aſſent, unleſs we know them to have been <q rend="inline">"free both from any particular Enthuſiaſm, and a general Turn to Melancholy."</q> But with Regard to the Miracles of the Goſpel, we know that many were converted by them, from their former
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1167800100:309"/>
Prejudices; and therefore could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be under the Influence of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Enthuſiaſm, ſuppoſing it ſuch. And as to their being free from <hi>Melancholy;</hi> for this we may ſafely appeal to the rational and conſiſtent Accounts given by the ſacred Penmen. Melancholy and Enthuſiaſm muſt ever produce inconſiſtent Viſions. For a Proof that the Scripture Miracles are not of this Nature, we appeal to what hath been already ſaid on this Subject in the preceeding Section.</p>
               <p>BUT there is <hi>one</hi> miraculous Gift, <hi>the Gift of Tongues,</hi> which hath more generally been ſuppoſed the peculiar Effect of Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. We have an Account of this Kind recorded in holy Writ<note n="i" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>BUT leaving his Lordſhip's Admirers to determine which is the greater Miracle, a <hi>Gift</hi> of Tongues from <hi>God,</hi> or a Gift of Tongues from <hi>Melancholy;</hi> 'tis our Part to ſhew the eſſential Characters of Diſtinction between the <hi>Reality</hi> of <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>Pretences</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> Now this will appear moſt evident, if we compare them, both in their <hi>Manner,</hi> and their <hi>End.</hi> As to the <hi>Manner</hi> of this <hi>new prophecying Sect,</hi> the noble Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf tells us, it was that of <hi>Ecſtacy</hi> and <hi>Convulſion;</hi> and that he ſaw this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman under an <hi>Agitation</hi> when he had the <hi>Gift of Tongues.</hi> As to the <hi>End</hi> pretended in this miraculous <hi>Gift;</hi> it appears there was really <hi>none:</hi> For the <hi>pompous Latin Style</hi> was uttered among a People who, in general, underſtood the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language <hi>only:</hi> It could therefore ſerve to no <hi>rational Purpoſe.</hi> On the contrary, it appears that the miraculous Gift of Tongues conferred on the Apoſtles, was <hi>rational</hi> both in its <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and it's <hi>End.</hi> There is not the leaſt Hint of it's having been attended with <hi>Ecſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies</hi> or <hi>Convulſions;</hi> nay, it appears from
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:1167800100:312"/>
the Account, that it could not have been ſo attended: And from the <hi>Occaſion</hi> it appears how proper it was, with Regard to it's <hi>End.</hi> The Recital is noble and rational: Let it anſwer for itſelf. <q rend="inline">"And there were dwelling at Jeruſalem, JEWS, devout Men, out of <hi>every Nation</hi> under Heaven.—And they were all amazed, and marvelled, ſaying one to another, Behold, are not all theſe which ſpeak, <hi>Galileans?</hi> And how hear we <hi>every</hi> Man in <hi>our own Tongue,</hi> wherein we were born? <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Elamites,</hi> the Dwellers in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia,</hi> and in <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Cappodocia,</hi> in <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Aſia, Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylia,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Parts of <hi>Libya</hi> about <hi>Cyrene:</hi> And Strangers of <hi>Rome; Jews</hi> and <hi>Proſelytes, Cretes</hi> and <hi>Arabians;</hi> we do <hi>hear them ſpeak in our Tongues the wonderful Works of God!</hi>"</q> How juſt an Effort of divine Power! which ſhould at once give <hi>Inſtruction</hi> to thoſe who moſt wanted it; and be the <hi>natural Means</hi> of conveying and <hi>diſperſing</hi> the glad Tydings of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to <hi>every Nation under Heaven!</hi>—It ſhould ſeem probable, therefore, that the Men who <q rend="inline">"mocked and ſaid, theſe Men are full of new Wine,"</q> were the <hi>Natives of</hi>

               </p>
               <p>ANOTHER remarkable Circumſtance, in which Enthuſiaſts have often pretended to reſemble the divinely inſpired, is <q rend="inline">"the Gift of Prophecy."</q> Which, indeed, is no more than another Kind of Miracle. In this too, Enthuſiaſm hath always betrayed itſelf. Firſt, and principally, with regard to the Event. The frequent Attempts of this Kind, and their perpetual <hi>Failure,</hi> need not here been umerated: They are known ſufficiently. This cannot be charged on the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> with the leaſt Appearance of Reaſon: For it is a Gift they hardly ever pretended to. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> indeed foretold many and great Events—the Defection of PETER; his own Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the Deſcent of the Holy Spirit, the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:1167800100:314"/>
Perſecution of his Diſciples, the Propagation of his Religion among the Gentiles, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Miſeries and final Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now all theſe Events were clearly accompliſhed: So far, therefore, are they from proving him an <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> that they demonſtrate him poſſeſſed of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Fore-Knowledge.</hi>

               <p>BUT beſides the <hi>Event,</hi> there is a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Circumſtance in the <hi>Manner,</hi> which hath ever diſtinguiſhed <hi>real</hi> from <hi>pretended, true</hi> from <hi>falſe</hi> Prophecy: And which the noble Writer's groundleſs Affirmations have made it neceſſary to inſiſt on.</p>
               <p>HE ſays, <q rend="inline">"I find by preſent Experience, as well as by all Hiſtories ſacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, that the Operation of this Spirit is every where the <hi>ſame</hi> as to the <hi>bodily Organ</hi>

The <hi>one</hi> was zealous to fix a Reſemblance between the <hi>old</hi> and the <hi>new</hi> prophetic Manner, in order to ſtrengthen the Credit of the <hi>revived</hi> Prophecy: The <hi>other's</hi> Intention plainly was, by that very <hi>Reſemblance,</hi> which he was willing ſhould paſs for <hi>real,</hi> to deſtroy the Credit of the <hi>Scripture</hi> Prophecies, well knowing that the other deſerved none.</p>
               <p>BUT ſo it happens, that the noble Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Friend proves as bad an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> as he was a <hi>Prophet:</hi> And fails as miſerably in relating <hi>paſt</hi> Events, as in foretelling <hi>future.</hi> The Truth is, that both his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and the Gentleman ſeem to have been in a <hi>Fit of Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and have therefore been induced to mingle a little <hi>pious Fraud,</hi> thro' a Zeal for their reſpective <hi>Theories.</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:1167800100:316"/>
For in Reality, this pretended Reſemblance is utterly fictitious. There is not the leaſt Hint in Scripture, that any of the Perſons mentioned as true Prophets, were ever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe <hi>Ecſtatic, convulſive</hi> Motions, which the enthuſiaſtic Gentleman and his Tribe were always ſeized with.

               <p>INDEED, from the Inſtances which the noble Writer cites from VIRGIL and LIVY, 'tis evident that the old <hi>heathen Pretenders</hi> to Prophecy were affected in the ſame <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive</hi> Manner, as the <hi>modern Chriſtian</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts.

               </p>
               <p>THESE are the Circumſtances in which Enthuſiaſm will generally <hi>ſeem</hi> to <hi>reſemble</hi> real Inſpiration: tho' on a nearer Scrutiny, theſe very Circumſtances will always <hi>detect</hi> it. We come now to enumerate thoſe other Qualities peculiar to Enthuſiaſm, in which it bears no Reſemblance to divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in which they are, at firſt View, clearly diſtinguiſhed from each other. And here it is remarkable, that, as the noble Writer <hi>dwells</hi> on the <hi>former,</hi> ſo he ſcarce ever <hi>touches</hi> on theſe following Characters of <hi>clear diſtinction.</hi> This pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Conduct can hardly be judged <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:</hi> For a Man of Wit can eaſily improve a <hi>partial</hi> Reſemblance into a <hi>complete</hi> one: But to have added other <hi>Features,</hi> of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Diſſimilarity,</hi> would have weakened the <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> and conſequently have diſgraced the <hi>intended Repreſentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE chief Qualities, which clearly, and at firſt View, diſtinguiſh <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> from divine <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> I find enumerated by the

And a brief Conſideration may ſuffice: For all (except the laſt) are ſo repugnant to their Characters, that the very Mention of them refutes the Imputation.</p>
               <p>WITH Regard to the firſt of theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <q rend="inline">"uncommon Heat of Temper,"</q> 'tis of all others moſt abhorrent from our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's</hi> Character.

THE Charge of <hi>Credulity</hi> hath no better Foundation.

               <p>THE laſt Quality common to Enthuſiaſts, is that of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> This hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times charged on our Saviour himſelf: often on his Apoſtles with an Air of Triumph. But ſo it is, that <hi>ſeeming Objections</hi> againſt Truth become often the <hi>ſtrongeſt Evidence</hi> in Support of it. This will eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the preſent Caſe, if we conſider <q rend="inline">"that Ignorance or Want of Letters, when joined with Enthuſiaſm, muſt always produce the moſt <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> Viſions, <hi>whimſical</hi> Conduct, and <hi>pernicious</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines."</q> Theſe Effects, <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm</hi> have wrought wherever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, in every Age and Nation. Nor can it indeed be otherwiſe: For a <hi>lettered</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt may be ſuppoſed to have an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Balance,</hi> which muſt in ſome Degree <hi>counteract</hi> and <hi>regulate</hi> his Viſions; while the <hi>unlettered</hi> is ſubject to no Controul, but muſt become the Sport and Prey to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirious</hi> Flights of an <hi>unreined Imagination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW, that the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts were <hi>unlearned,</hi> muſt needs be granted: And tho' the noble Writer hath taken upon him to deride them on this Account; yet
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:1167800100:323"/>
this very Circumſtance, compared with their Conduct and Writings, clears them at once from the Charge of Enthuſiaſm. So far were they from the <hi>ravings</hi> of this Paſſion, common to all <hi>ignorant</hi> Enthuſiaſts, that we may defy the Enemies of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to produce any Inſtance either of Speech or Practice, that hath the ſmalleſt Tincture of <hi>Extravagance.</hi> Their Conduct was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and exemplary; their Words were <hi>the Words of Truth and Soberneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS to the Charge of Ignorance againſt our Saviour, the Enemies of Chriſtianity have been more <hi>cautious:</hi> Yet it hath been inſinuated. And indeed, that he had not the common Aids of <hi>human Learning,</hi> is not only <hi>acknowledged,</hi> but <hi>inſiſted</hi> on. Could <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>blind Enthuſiaſm</hi> then have produced the ſublime <hi>religious Doctrines</hi> and <hi>moral Precepts</hi> which the Evangeliſts have <hi>recorded</hi> from his Mouth? With as much Truth it might be affirmed that the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is the Produce of <hi>Chance.</hi> With Reaſon then may we aſk the noble Writer this Queſtion, <q rend="inline">"Whence then had this Man <hi>ſuch Wiſdom,</hi> ſeeing he ſpake as never Man ſpake?"</q> And the Anſwer ſure is <hi>one</hi> only, <q rend="inline">"That as it was not from <hi>Man,</hi> it muſt

have been from GOD."</q> For even the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſtianity have born Witneſs to it's Excellence, even when they intended to diſgrace it: While with fruitleſs Labour they have attempted to prove, <q rend="inline">"that the moſt exalted <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> may be found <hi>ſcattered</hi> among the Writings of the <hi>heathen Sages.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>FROM theſe concurrent Circumſtances, therefore, we obtain a full <hi>internal Proof,</hi> that the <hi>Founders of Chriſtianity</hi> were not <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> as the noble Writer hath, by the moſt laboured and repeated Inſinuations, attempted to repreſent them.</p>

and <hi>Truth,</hi> with which he tells us, in ancient Times they never interfered: He therefore derides every Attempt to make them <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aleſce.</hi> Thus he tells us, <q rend="inline">"Not only <hi>Viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> of all Kinds were tolerated by the Ancients; but, on the other Side, Philoſophy had as free a Courſe, and was permitted as a Balance againſt Superſtition.—Thus Matters were happily balanced; Reaſon had fair Play; Learning and Science flouriſhed.

of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> In early and ignorant Ages, the Neceſſity of religious Belief and religious Eſtabliſhments was ſeen by the Leaders of Mankind: On this Account they inſtituted the moſt <hi>ſalutary</hi> Forms and Doctrines, which their unexperienced Reaſon could ſuggeſt. As Nations grew wiſer and more poliſhed, they ſaw the Weakneſs and Abſurdity of theſe eſtabliſhed Syſtems; but thro' a Regard, and perhaps a <hi>miſtaken</hi> one, to the <hi>public Good,</hi> were unwilling to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover theſe Defects and Abſurdities to the People.

               <p>THUS, what was the Effect of <hi>Neceſſity</hi> among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> the noble Writer very partially attributes to <hi>Choice:</hi> He miſtakes a <hi>Defect</hi> for an <hi>Excellence:</hi> And blindly prefers the Weakneſs of <hi>Man,</hi> to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Cavil frequently urged or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated by his Lordſhip againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſeems to have been the natural Conſequence of the laſt-mentioned.

tending to <hi>deſtroy</hi> every other but itſelf.

               <p>BUT the Chriſtian Doctrines relating to an <hi>hereafter,</hi> are to undergo a yet ſeverer <hi>Inquiſition</hi> from the noble Writer: They are to be tortured and <hi>mangled</hi> on the <hi>Rack,</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> ſhall I ſay, or of <hi>Buffoonry?</hi>

               <p>THIS Paſſage contains two inſinuated Charges of a very different Nature. The one is <hi>true,</hi> but no <hi>Objection:</hi> The other would indeed be an <hi>Objection,</hi> but that it is
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1167800100:336"/>
abſolutely <hi>groundleſs.</hi> 'Tis true <q rend="inline">"that our Religion is for the greateſt Part adapted to the very meaneſt Capacities; and that the celeſtial Phaenomena are in the ſacred Volumes generally treated according to <hi>common Imagination,</hi>" &amp;c.</q> And would the noble Writer indeed have had it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Would he indeed have had them ſpoken of, according to the Philoſophical Conſtruction of the Univerſe, rather than the received Notions of Mankind? With how little Reaſon, we may ſoon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, if we conſider, Firſt, that the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Revelation</hi> was not to make Mankind Proficients in Philoſophy, ſince the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Generality can never admit it: And had the Scriptures ſuppoſed this, (as indeed ſuch a Conduct would have ſuppoſed it) this very Circumſtance had been an Argument of their Falſehood. Secondly, even Philoſophers themſelves, tho' inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with the Conſtruction of the Univerſe, do ſtill <hi>deſcend</hi> to the <hi>Level of Mankind,</hi> when they ſpeak of the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of Nature: The <hi>Sun ſets</hi> and <hi>riſes,</hi> as it did three thouſand Years ago: The <hi>Moon changes, wains,</hi> is <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>old:</hi> The <hi>Stars</hi> are <hi>in the Firmament,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi>

ſtill <hi>rules the Day,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>Night.</hi> The Reaſon is evident: Becauſe <hi>aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſcoveries</hi> have not the leaſt Influence on the <hi>Practice of Mankind:</hi> Becauſe, altho' the <hi>natural Appearances</hi> of things are merely <hi>relative</hi> to the <hi>Imagination only,</hi> yet they are, for that very Reaſon, neceſſary to be referred to, as the <hi>Imagination</hi> is the great <hi>univerſal Inſtrument</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and human <hi>Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AN Objection therefore to the Scriptures on this Account, betrays either a groſs <hi>Miſapprehenſion</hi> of human Nature, or the moſt unpardonable <hi>Inſincerity;</hi> yet we find Objections of this kind frequently urged: as if, becauſe the ſacred Penmen were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by God to reveal to us a certain Meaſure of <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> Truth, ſuited to our preſent State, they muſt therefore be endued with <hi>Omniſcience;</hi> in order to make all Men not only <hi>good Subjects,</hi> but good <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> too!</p>
               <p>BUT tho' it were <hi>Folly</hi> to object againſt the <hi>ſacred Penmen,</hi> becauſe they appear not to have been <hi>omniſcient;</hi> yet I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Argument, without producing a remarkable Inſtance, wherein their very <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> of theſe <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>unneceſſary</hi>

                  <hi>Truths</hi> becomes a convincing Proof of their VERACITY: A Circumſtance which much more nearly concerns us. We read in the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THE noble Writer's other Charge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>moral Repreſentations</hi> of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:1167800100:339"/>
Scriptures, would indeed be of Weight, if it were founded in Truth: But ſo far from this, that he hath utterly <hi>reverſed</hi> the Fact.

'Tis evident that the noble Writer lays the principal Streſs of his Charge, on the <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> a Work in it's whole Turn <hi>ſtrictly allegorical,</hi> and therefore neceſſarily converſant in <hi>Imagery</hi> and <hi>viſible Repreſentation.</hi> To this he hath moſt <hi>perverſly</hi> added a figurative Expreſſion of St. PAUL, who writing to a People among whom the <hi>Prize-Races</hi> prevailed, repreſents the Chriſtian <hi>Progreſs</hi> as a <hi>Conteſt</hi> of this Kind; and ſhews it's Superiority over the Former, <q rend="inline">"becauſe, ſaith he, they labour to obtain a <hi>corruptible,</hi> but we an <hi>incorruptible Crown.</hi>"</q> In the mean

WE have already ſeen, that the real Nature of Virtue conſiſts <q rend="inline">"in procuring or promoting the greateſt public Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:"</q> And that this Truth is often, <hi>occaſionally,</hi> acknowledged by Lord <hi>Shafteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> himſelf.

               </p>
               <p>ON this plain Principle, ſelf-evident to unbyaſſed <hi>Reaſon,</hi> let us examine the Paſſage now before us. And firſt, as to <hi>private Friendſhip,</hi> which, the noble Writer ſays, <q rend="inline">"is a Virtue purely voluntary in a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian:"</q>—Let us conſider how far it may be regarded as a Virtue <hi>at all.</hi>—Now, on ſtrict Enquiry we ſhall find, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Degree of Friendſhip recommended and applauded by the Ancients, and here pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized by the noble Author, is eſſentially <hi>repugnant</hi> to <hi>true Virtue:</hi> In <hi>Friendſhip</hi> they placed the <hi>Chief Happineſs:</hi>—And if this conſiſts in the ſupreme Love of <hi>one,</hi> it muſt needs <hi>diminiſh,</hi> if not <hi>extinguiſh,</hi> the Love of <hi>all;</hi> becauſe our chief or whole <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> muſt be <hi>employed,</hi> our every <hi>View</hi> and <hi>Deſign centered</hi> in giving Pleaſure or <hi>procuring</hi>

               <p>FOR we ſhall further ſee, how little it generally partakes of the Nature of true Virtue, if we conſider whence it hath it's Riſe. This is univerſally allowed to be <q rend="inline">"a Similarity of <hi>Diſpoſition, Will,</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>"</q> This Circumſtance demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that in general it muſt be <hi>contrary</hi> to Virtue: For hence, the <hi>general</hi> Good muſt be often ſacrificed to gratify the Will of <hi>one.</hi> Of this dreadſul Effect, Inſtances might be produced almoſt innumerable.

               <p>'TIS true, the Advocates for this <hi>Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ſometimes aſſert, that it cannot conſiſt but with <hi>Virtue.</hi> That it <hi>ought not,</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: That it <hi>cannot,</hi> or <hi>doth not,</hi> is a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Conceit; unleſs they chuſe to make this Circumſtance a Part of the Definition, which were idle Sophiſtry.

Will any one alledge the Emperor TIBERIUS or his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite SEJANUS as Patterns of Virtue? Yet their Friendſhip was ſo remarkable,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:1167800100:345"/>
that, in Honour of it, Altars were dedicated to <hi>Friendſhip</hi> by a <hi>ſenatorial Decree.</hi> Nay, ſome of the applauded Inſtances appealed to, by the noble Author in his Comment on this Paſſage, are even notorious in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Such were THESEUS and PIRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOUS, equally remarkable for <hi>Friendſhip, Rapes,</hi> and <hi>Plunder.</hi> And ſuch Inſtances may ſtill be found in every <hi>ſavage</hi> Country; where the ſtrongeſt Friendſhips are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly formed: Where Men thus <hi>leagued,</hi> go upon bold Adventures; and hazard and give up Life for each other without Reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, while they <hi>raviſh</hi> their Neighbours <hi>Wives,</hi> and <hi>carry off</hi> their <hi>Cattle.</hi>

               <p>With as little Reaſon can it be urged, that Friendſhips in general are <hi>diſintereſted,</hi> ſo as to aſpire to the Name of <hi>Merit.</hi> For <hi>Merit,</hi> if it exiſts, can only ariſe from <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi> And Virtue, we have ſeen, doth not eſſentially belong to Friendſhip.

               </p>
               <p>BUT if by <q rend="inline">"Zeal for the Publick and Love of our Country"</q> be meant, ſuch a Regard to it's Welfare as ſhall induce us to ſacrifice every View of private Intereſt for it's Accompliſhment, yet ſtill <hi>in Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to the <hi>greater Law</hi> of <hi>univerſal Juſtice,</hi> this is naturally, nay neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the Law of <hi>univerſal Charity.</hi> The noble Writer indeed affirms, <q rend="inline">"it is no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Part of the Chriſtian's Charity."</q> On the contrary it is a <hi>chief Part</hi> of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian's Charity. It comes nobly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Examples of JESUS and St PAUL: The one wept over the approaching Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Country: The other declared
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:1167800100:353"/>
his Willingneſs to be cut off from the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Community, if by this Means he might ſave his Countrymen. And that it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ariſeth from the Principle of univerſal Love will be evident, if we conſider the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Situation</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi> His <hi>Nature</hi> is ſuch, that he inevitably contracts the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> Affection for thoſe with whom he converſeth moſt <hi>intimately;</hi> and whoſe <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>Relations, civil</hi> and <hi>religious,</hi> are moſt nearly connected with <hi>his own.</hi> His <hi>Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is ſuch, that he ſeldom hath an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing good Offices to any Society of Men, ſave only thoſe of his <hi>own Country;</hi> all others being naturally removed beyond the narrow Sphere of private Beneficence. Hence the great Precept of univerſal Charity doth eſſentially involve <q rend="inline">"a Zeal for the Publick and Love of our Country:"</q> At once it <hi>curbs</hi> the <hi>Exorbitance</hi> of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Partiality, and <hi>carries</hi> it to it's full <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Neceſſity of this great <hi>Regulating</hi> Principle will further appear, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that with Regard to the Conduct of ſeparate States and Kingdoms towards each other, no Sanctions of human Law can ever take place. In this reſpect all Nations muſt ever be in a State of Nature. There was
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:1167800100:354"/>
therefore a more particular Neceſſity, on this Account, of regulating their Conduct towards each other, by the great Law of <hi>univerſal Charity.</hi>

               <p>THE noble Writer proceeds to his <hi>ſecond</hi> Head; but ſeems at the ſame time conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous how little it was to any good Purpoſe.

               <p>THE next, and only remaining Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance worthy of Notice in this Miſcellany, is a <hi>pretended Tranſlation</hi> from PLUTARCH: In which the noble Writer deals as honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably by that Author, as before by GORGIAS or ARISTOTLE<note n="m" place="bottom">

and <hi>Taſte:</hi> Conſequently all their Value lies in the <hi>Exquiſiteneſs</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> and the <hi>fine Hand</hi> of the Maſter.

               </p>
               <p>BUT with Reſpect to Language the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair is otherwiſe: It's <hi>Ends</hi> are <hi>various.</hi> From the Four different Kinds of literary Compoſition, as explained above<note n="u" place="bottom">

From being adapted, not to the <hi>Taſte</hi> of the <hi>faſtidious Critic,</hi> but to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities</hi> of thoſe who are the intended Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> or <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> Here then, the noble Writer's Parallel is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally defective: Since it was the Intention of <hi>Providence,</hi> in the ſacred Scriptures, to condeſcend to what his Lordſhip's Quality and refined Wiſdom intitle him to diſdain, even <hi>to inſtruct the mere Vulgar:</hi> Whereas the End of <hi>Painting,</hi> is only <hi>the Amuſement of the Few.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN Regard to the <hi>Execution,</hi> we ſhall find as wide a Difference. There is, in Philoſophical ſtrictneſs, but one <hi>unvary'd Language</hi> or <hi>Style</hi> in <hi>Painting;</hi> which is <q rend="inline">"ſuch a Modification of <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Colours</hi> as may imitate whatever Objects we find in Nature."</q> This conſiſts not in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of <hi>arbitrary Signs;</hi> but hath it's Foundation in the <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Mankind; and is therefore <hi>the ſame</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age and Nation. But in the literary <hi>Style</hi> or <hi>Language,</hi> the Matter is far otherwiſe. For Language being the <hi>voluntary</hi> Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>arbitrary</hi> Signs, according to the Conſent of different Men and Nations, there is no <hi>ſingle uniform Model of Nature</hi> to be
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1167800100:386"/>
followed. Hence <hi>Gracefulneſs</hi> or <hi>Strength</hi> of Style, <hi>Harmony</hi> or <hi>Softneſs, copious</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>terſe</hi> Brevity, or <hi>contraſted</hi> Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, have by turns gained the Approbation of particular Countries. Now all theſe <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Beauties of Speech are <hi>relative, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and <hi>capricious;</hi> and conſequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the Imitation of a divine Artiſt; who, to fit the Speech he <hi>ordains,</hi> to the great Work of <hi>univerſal Inſtruction,</hi> would, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, ſtrip it of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>local, peculiar,</hi> and <hi>groteſque</hi> Ornament; and convey it unaccompany'd by all, but the more <hi>univerſal</hi> Qualities common to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tongue.</p>
               <p>THE noble Writer, then, might with ſome ſhew of Reaſon have objected to the <hi>Style</hi> of Scripture, had the Writers boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it's <hi>Elegance,</hi> as MAHOMET did that of his <hi>Koran,</hi> and defy'd all his Oppoſers to write any thing approaching it in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. But the ſacred Penmen diſcover no <hi>Deſign</hi> or <hi>Deſire</hi> of excelling as <hi>fine</hi> Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: On the contrary, St. PAUL ſays, <q rend="inline">"they came not with the Power of human Speech,"</q> and gives a Reaſon for it which does Honour to his Miſſion.</p>

THO' this Scrutiny alone might be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to detect and diſcredit the Wantonneſs of the noble Writer's Compariſon; yet it will further lead us to a full Diſcloſure of the Truth; by ſhewing <hi>that</hi> to be the peculiar Characteriſtic of the Scripture <hi>Compoſition,</hi> which hath ever held the firſt Rank among the Qualities of human Writings; I mean, that of <hi>unadorned</hi> SIMPLICITY.</p>
               <p>AS much hath been ſaid by many Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on the Subject of <hi>Simplicity,</hi> with very little Preciſion; and particularly by the noble Writer, who ſeems to ſeparate the <hi>ſimple</hi> Manner from the <hi>Sublime,</hi> as if they were <hi>incompatible</hi>

this one Circumſtance, <q rend="inline">"that their moſt elaborate and celebrated Compoſitions were all wrote in a <hi>dead Language:</hi>"</q> For thus they became mere <hi>Imitators,</hi> even to a Degree of <hi>Servility.</hi> And 'tis ſufficient for the Defenders of the <hi>Bible</hi> to obſerve, that along with <hi>it,</hi> every other great Model of antient Writing fell into the ſame Diſgrace at the above-mentioned Period; while the general Taſte and Attention was turned from weight of <hi>Sentiment,</hi> and ſtrength of <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> to the <hi>local</hi> and <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious</hi> Decorations of <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Language.</hi> But the Reign of this falſe Taſte was of ſhort Duration; ſo that for a long Time paſt, the comparative Merit of ancient Writers hath been <hi>weighed</hi> in a juſter <hi>Scale.</hi>

affected Conceits, the mere <hi>Trappings</hi> of Compoſition, and <hi>Gothic</hi> MINUTIAE.

                     <p>Mr. DRYDEN ſomewhere obſerves <q rend="inline">"that MIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON never ſinks ſo far below himſelf, as when he falls on <hi>ſome Track of Scripture.</hi>"</q> 'Tis equally true, that he never <hi>riſes</hi> ſo far <hi>above himſelf,</hi> as when he falls on ſome <hi>Track of Scripture.</hi> 'Tis eaſy to gueſs what was the Drift of Mr. DRYDEN's Remark. But the Obſervations made above (<hi>Eſſay</hi> i. § 3) will eaſily reconcile theſe ſeeming Contradictions When MILTON adopts the <hi>poetical</hi> Parts of Scripture, he <hi>riſes</hi> above himſelf. But by an <hi>injudicious Application</hi> of the <hi>hiſtorical</hi> or <hi>didactic</hi> Parts, he <hi>often falls indeed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS naturally leads us to an Obſervation on Mr. HUME's Eſſay "<hi>on Simplicity and Refinement in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>" He hath attempted to fix a certain <hi>Union</hi> of theſe two Qualities, which, he ſays, conſtitutes the moſt perfect Form of Compoſition. It were to be wiſhed he had given us ſome better <hi>Reaſons</hi> in ſupport of this <hi>Opinion,</hi> which itſelf ſeems to be a mere <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</hi> The Progreſs of his Argument is remarkable.—He draws all his Inſtances from <hi>Poets;</hi> and having given ſome Examples of Poets who are both <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>unpoetical</hi> in the Extreme, he arbitrarily throws the Cenſure on the too great Degree of <hi>Simplicity,</hi> inſtead of fixing it where he ought, <hi>viz.</hi> on the too great Mixture of the <hi>hiſtorical, oratorial,</hi> or <hi>argumentative</hi> Species. In Proof of this, we need only alledge the Examples of HOMER, PINDAR, and CALLIMACHUS, where <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and at the ſame Time <hi>Sublimity</hi> and the <hi>true poetic Forms,</hi> are in their laſt <hi>Perfection.</hi> Thus all he proves is, <q rend="inline">"that a <hi>Poet</hi> ought not to be <hi>unpoetical.</hi>"</q>—Next, he puts VIRGIL and RACINE on a <hi>Level,</hi> as having attained the neareſt to this <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined Union</hi> of <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Refinement.</hi> Here he obligeth us again to call his Taſte in Queſtion: For every Page of RACINE is full of <hi>Turns,</hi> both of <hi>Phraſe</hi> and <hi>Sentiment:</hi> Whereas we ſcarce meet with three Inſtances of this Kind in all VIRGIL's Writings.—He then gives us his Idea of <hi>Simplicity:</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which have the Recommendation of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, have <hi>nothing ſurprizing</hi> in the Thought, when diveſted of that <hi>Elegance of Expreſſion,</hi> and <hi>Harmony of Numbers,</hi> with which it is cloathed."</q>—From theſe extraordinary <hi>Premiſes,</hi> we are naturally prepared to expect his <hi>Concluſion,</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"that CATULLUS and PARNEL are his <hi>favourite</hi> Authors!"</q>

AS it appears from theſe Inſtances, that <hi>Simplicity</hi> is the only univerſal Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic of juſt Writing; ſo the ſuperior Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of the ſacred Scriptures in this prime Quality hath been generally acknowledged. One of the greateſt Critics in Antiquity, himſelf conſpicuous in the <hi>ſublime</hi> and <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> Manner, hath born this Teſtimony to the Writings of MOSES and St. PAUL<note n="p" place="bottom">Longinus.</note>. And by Parity of Reaſon we muſt conclude, that had he been converſant with the other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writers, his <hi>Taſte</hi> and <hi>Candour</hi> would have allowed them the ſame Encomium.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:1167800100:397"/>
BUT we need not have Recourſe to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, for the Proof of the ſuperior Weight and Dignity of the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in this great Quality. 'Tis evident to Demonſtration from the following Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. It hath been often obſerved, even by Writers of no mean Rank, that <q rend="inline">"the Scriptures ſuffer in their Credit by the <hi>Diſadvantage</hi> of a <hi>literal Verſion,</hi> while other ancient Writings enjoy the <hi>Advantage</hi> of a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>embelliſhed Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>"</q> But in Reality theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's Concern is ill-placed and groundleſs. For the Truth is, <q rend="inline">"That moſt other Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are indeed <hi>impaired</hi> by a <hi>literal Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> whereas, giving only a due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>Idioms</hi> of different Languages, the ſacred Writings when <hi>literally tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi> are then in their full Perfection."</q> Now this is an <hi>internal</hi> Proof, that in all other Writings there is a Mixture of <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, relative, exterior</hi> Ornament; which is often loſt in the Transfuſion from one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to another. But the <hi>internal</hi> Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which depend not on the <hi>particular</hi> Conſtruction of <hi>Tongues,</hi> no <hi>Change</hi> of <hi>Tongue</hi> can deſtroy. Hence the <hi>Bible-Compoſition</hi> preſerves its native Beauty and Strength,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:1167800100:398"/>
alike in every Language, by the ſole Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of unadorned Phraſe, natural Images, weight of Sentiment, and <hi>great Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS in this Reſpect, like a rich Vein of <hi>Gold,</hi> which, under the ſevereſt Trials of Heat, Cold, and Moiſture, retains its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Splendor,</hi> without either Loſs or Alloy; while baſer Metals are corrupted by Earth, Air, Water, Fire, and aſſimilated to the various Elements thro' which they paſs.</p>
               <p>THIS Circumſtance then may be juſtly regarded as ſufficient to vindicate the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſacred Scriptures; as it is at once their chief <hi>Excellence,</hi> and greateſt <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</hi> 'Tis their <hi>Excellence,</hi> as it renders them <hi>intelligible</hi> and <hi>uſeful to all;</hi> 'tis their <hi>Security,</hi> as it prevents their being diſguiſed by the <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>capricious</hi> Ornaments of <hi>vain</hi> or <hi>weak Tranſlators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE may ſafely appeal to Experience and Fact for the Confirmation of theſe Remarks on the ſuperior Simplicity, Utility, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the Style of holy Scripture. Is there any Book in the World, ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adapted to all Capacities? that contains ſuch <hi>ſublime</hi> and <hi>exalting</hi> Precepts, convey'd
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:1167800100:399"/>
in ſuch an <hi>artleſs</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> Strain? that can be read with ſuch Pleaſure and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, by the lettered <hi>Sage</hi> and the unlettered <hi>Peaſant?</hi> To whom then would the noble Writer ſend Mankind for religious and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtruction? To the divine PLATO, it may be ſuppoſed; or, more probably, to the <hi>inraptured</hi> Strains of PHILOCLES and THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OCLES. And ſure, Mankind muſt reap much Inſtruction and Advantage from the <hi>puffed Epithets</hi> and <hi>ſuſtian Style</hi> of a <hi>philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Romance.</hi> We may reaſonably hope indeed, ſoon to ſee (nay, do we not already ſee?) the happy Effects of this high Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. For in Fact, the noble Writer's <hi>Characteriſtics</hi> are now the ſtanding <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> in the <hi>Office,</hi> the <hi>Shop,</hi> nay, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ſometimes even in the <hi>Cobler's Stall.</hi> We need not wonder therefore, that in theſe new Habitations of <hi>Taſte, ſublimed Phraſe,</hi> and <hi>abſtruſe Philoſophy,</hi> the <hi>ſimple</hi> Strains of the Goſpel are <hi>damned</hi> and <hi>diſcarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO return then to the noble Writer's Compariſon (if indeed we have departed from it) theſe united Obſervations may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that the only circumſtance in Painting, which can with any Propriety be compared to literary <hi>Style,</hi> is that of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:1167800100:400"/>
                  <hi>colouring.</hi> And on this principle we may farther confirm all that hath been ſaid on the ſuperior Excellence of the <hi>ſimple</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For 'tis well known, and the noble Writer knew it, that while the Maſters in this fine Art confined the Pencil to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Forms of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> and only ſuperadded to theſe the temperate Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments of a <hi>chaſtiſed</hi> and <hi>modeſt</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring, the Art grew towards its <hi>Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> but no ſooner was their Attention turned from <hi>Truth, Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>Deſign,</hi> to the gaudy Decorations of a rich and luſcious <hi>Colouring,</hi> than their Credit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined with their Art: and the experienced Eye, which contemplates the <hi>old</hi> Pictures with <hi>Admiration,</hi> ſurveys the <hi>modern</hi> with Indifference or <hi>Contempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO conclude. We ſee there are two Kinds of <hi>Compoſition,</hi> eſſentially oppoſed to each other. The <hi>one</hi> turns the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on <hi>itſelf;</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> on <hi>the Truths it conveys.</hi> The firſt may be juſtly compared to a <hi>Sun-Beam playing</hi> on the <hi>Surface</hi> of the Water, which <hi>attracts</hi> and <hi>dazzles</hi> the Beholder's Eye by its own <hi>uſeleſs Splendor.</hi> The laſt is like a <hi>Sun-Beam</hi> darting to the Bottom; which, while itſelf is <hi>unſeen,</hi> or
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:1167800100:401"/>
                  <hi>unobſerved, communicates</hi> its brightneſs, and <hi>illumines every Object on which it falls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOW far the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe may belong to to the noble Writer, let others determine. 'Tis ſufficient to have proved, that the <hi>laſt</hi> is the <hi>unvaried</hi> Style and Manner of the <hi>ſacred Scriptures.</hi>

               <p>SO far as his Spirit of Satire may have been provoked by the perſecuting and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerant Principles of ſome of the <hi>Clergy</hi> in his Time, 'tis highly commendable.

               <p>BUT it appears too evidently, that the noble Writer's <hi>Spleen</hi> aroſe from another Foundation. For his Satire is not ſo often

pointed againſt them, as being the <hi>Enemies of Freedom,</hi> as the <hi>Friends of Chriſtianity.</hi> With a view of diſgracing them in this Regard, he hath ridiculed and abuſed their <hi>Writings,</hi> their <hi>Preaching,</hi> and even their <hi>Perſons.</hi> It will only be neceſſary to ſelect a few Inſtances of this kind, from an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number; in all which, the <hi>Delicacy</hi> of the <hi>Raillery</hi> is ſo <hi>conſpicuous,</hi> as to need <hi>no Illuſtration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN his <hi>Soliloquy,</hi> he hath paid his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> under the Title of "Candidates for Authorſhip of the ſanctify'd Kind." <q rend="inline">"Theſe, he ſays, may be termed a ſort of <hi>Pſeudo-Aſcetics,</hi> who can have no real Converſe either with themſelves or with Heaven."—"And although the Books of this ſort, by a common Idiom, are called <hi>good Books,</hi> the Authors for certain are a <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Race</hi>"—"<hi>A Saint-Author, of all Men, leaſt values Politeneſs.</hi>—He is above the Conſideration of that, which in a narrow Senſe, we call <hi>Manners:</hi> nor is he apt to examine any other Faults, than thoſe which he calls <hi>Sins</hi>
