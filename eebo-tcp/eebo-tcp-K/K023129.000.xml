            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Reflections of <hi>Horace,</hi> and the Judgments paſt in this Epiſtle to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſeem'd ſo ſeaſonable to the preſent Times, that I could not help applying them to the uſe of my own Country. The Author thought them conſiderable enough to addreſs them to His Prince; whom he paints with all the great and good Qualities of a Monarch, upon whom the <hi>Romans</hi> depended for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of an <hi>Abſolute Empire.</hi> But to make the Poem en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Engliſh, I was willing to add one or two ſuch, as contribute to the Happineſs of a <hi>Free People,</hi> and are more conſiſtent with the Welfare of <hi>our Neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Epiſtle will ſhow the learned World to have fallen into two miſtakes; one, that <hi>Auguſtus was a Patron of Poets in general;</hi> whereas he not only prohibited all but the Beſt Writers to name him, but recommended that Care even to the Civil Magiſtrate: <hi>Admonebat Praetores, ne paterentur Nomen ſuum obſolefieri,</hi> &amp;c. The other to imagine this Piece to be a <hi>general Diſcourſe of Poetry;</hi> whereas it is an <hi>Apology for the Poets,</hi> in order to render <hi>Auguſtus</hi> more their Patron. <hi>Horace</hi> here pleads the Cauſe of his Cotemporaries, firſt againſt the Taſte of the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0247401900:3"/>
Town, whoſe humour it was to magnify the Authors of the preceding Age; ſecondly againſt the Court and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who encouraged only the Writers for the Theatre; and laſtly againſt the Emperor himſelf, who had conceived them of little uſe to the Government. He ſhews (by a view of the Progreſs of Learning, and the Change of Taſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans</hi>) that the Introduction of the Polite Arts of <hi>Greece</hi> had given the Writers of his Time great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages over their Predeceſſors, that their <hi>Morals</hi> were much improved, and the Licence of thoſe ancient Poets reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that <hi>Satire</hi> and <hi>Comedy</hi> were become more juſt and uſeful; that whatever extravagancies were left on the Stage, were owing to the Ill Taſte of the Nobility; that Poets, under due Regulations, were in many reſpects uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the <hi>State;</hi> and concludes, that it was upon them the Emperor himſelf muſt depend, for his Fame with Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>We may farther learn from this Epiſtle, that <hi>Horace</hi> made his Court to this Great Prince, by writing with a decent Freedom toward him, with a juſt Contempt of his low Flatterers, and with a manly Regard to his own Character.</p>
