            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU requeſt from me, with infinitely more
importunity than the thing is worth, a
copy of the ſhort compariſon between Mr.
Fox's India Bill and Mr. Pitt's, which I read
in my place in the Houſe of Commons in the
laſt day's debate upon the Declaratory Act.
I now ſend it to you, with a number of notes
or obſervations, which I have been induced
to add to it, from a deſire of complying more
fully with what I conceive to be your object in
aſking for the paper. I have been led into
more length than I intended on the ſubject,
and this muſt be my apology for not having
obeyed your commands ſooner.</p>
            <p>You will perceive, however, that I have
not, in theſe remarks, paid your judgment ſo
ill a compliment as to have endeavoured to
engage your attention by laboured argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1128401200:3"/>
ſtill leſs by any attempt at ornament.
I have endeavoured merely to be intelligible,
and to confine the illuſtrations I adopt, to
facts. If, upon the whole, you ſhould be of
opinion that theſe papers contain a fair ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the true meaning of the two Bills,
and ſome juſt comments upon that meaning,
they are at your diſpoſal to be put into any
perſon's hands you pleaſe, or to be given to
the public, if it is thought worth while to
do ſo.</p>
            <p>The compariſon itſelf I wrote in the Houſe
of Commons during the debate, from feeling
it, I confeſs, a teazing circumſtance to hear
gentlemen of the moſt reſpectable abilities day
after day arguing upon, and drawing paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels
between, the proviſions of the two Bills,
upon which it was perfectly obvious they had
not condeſcended to beſtow any very minute
degree of attention: and conceiving it to be
no very difficult taſk to reduce the diſcuſſion
to a plain and conciſe ſtatement of fact.
With regard to Mr. Fox's Bill, I do venture
peremptorily to aſſert, that there never was
a legiſlative meaſure ſo little examined, ſo
generally miſunderſtood, and ſo confidently
miſrepreſented.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge yourſelf to be one of
thoſe who have been in ſome degree of error
on the ſubject; and you confeſs that you
now begin to ſee the meaſure itſelf, as well
as the conduct of thoſe who oppoſed it, in a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1128401200:4"/>
new point of view; and that you meet with
many who confeſs the ſame. Nay, ſome even
of thoſe who were formerly moſt violent on
this topic, have in your hearing acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you ſay, (and you ſeem to expect me to
triumph in the intelligence), that "Mr. Pitt's
Bill is very like, if not quite as bad as Mr.
Fox's."—You will forgive my ſaying, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that this is a compromiſe which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhall accept, even as the overture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
confidence from thoſe whoſe good
opinion we moſt regretted to loſe. In fact,
there is no reſemblance between the two Bills
in any circumſtance, excepting only the little
ceremony with which they both treated the
Charter of the Company; nor could any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who ſupported Mr. Fox's Bill, and ſtill
approves the meaſure, give his countenance
to Mr. Pitt's, with the ſmalleſt degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency.—But examine the ſubject fairly
yourſelf upon the plain ground of fact.—I
will not attempt to bias your opinion by any
previous argument.</p>
            <p>You will receive with this a copy of the
other Bill brought in by Mr. Fox, (which
you ſay you never ſaw) intitled, "A Bill for
the better Government of the Territorial
Poſſeſſions and Dependencies in India."
This Bill accompanied what is uſually called
"<hi>Mr. Fox's India Bill,</hi>" but is ſeldom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
altho' it formed a very eſſential part
of the plan; and the conſideration of it is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1128401200:5"/>
extremely neceſſary to the underſtanding the
principle, and main object of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>I ſend you alſo a copy of Mr. Pitt's Bill, as
it came out of the Committee, when it was
re-printed, with its alterations and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
In looking it over, I do not deſire
you to take notice of the ludicrous manner
in which it is pieced and patched, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
and altered, almoſt from the beginning
to the end, merely to convince you of the ſad
ſlovenly ſtyle in which the act was framed,
but in order that you may compare the ſpirit
and obvious purpoſe of ſome of theſe altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with the text as it firſt ſtood; by doing
which you will be much better enabled to
judge of the true meaning of the original Act,
than by any thing you can learn from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory
Law.</p>
            <p>As to the Declaratory Law itſelf, and the
plea which was made for it,—we ſeem to be
perfectly agreed upon that ſubject. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
laid before the Houſe of Commons, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
contain, as you obſerve, a complete
refutation of all the pretences upon which the
ſending out the four regiments to India was
defended as <hi>a meaſure of neceſſity.</hi> And ſtill
more ſtrongly do I agree with you in your
remarks upon <hi>Declaratory Acts</hi> in general,
and upon the nature of this Declaratory Act
in particular. It is indeed an alarming and
an unfortunate event in the Hiſtory of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1128401200:6"/>—for it is one that ſhakes the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that ſecurity which all men hope from
Law, and of that reſpect which all men owe
to it—to ſee the Repreſentatives of the people
perſuaded to intercept the ordinary courſe of
juſtice, to aſſume themſelves a judicial cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
and, upon the ſuggeſtion of the King's
Miniſters, to determine a queſtion of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in favour of the ſervants of the Crown,
againſt the claims of the ſubject!</p>
            <p>Nor can our apprehenſions of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of this precedent be diminiſhed, by
reflecting upon the manner in which the
meaſure was carried thro' the Houſe of Lords;
by reflecting, that the ſupreme court of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
in this country ſhould have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by any influence or by any eloquence,
or upon any plea of neceſſity, pretended or
real, to decide—with unparalleled precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—upon a conſtruction of law—in the
abſence of the Judges of the land, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
granting a hearing to the parties intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their deciſion!</p>
            <p>Yet poſſibly you will be ſurpriſed when I
add, that it is <hi>becauſe</hi> I perfectly and cordially
agree with you in your obſervations upon
theſe proceedings, that I do not ſo readily
adopt the concluſion you have drawn with
regard to the advantage which, "the ex-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty"
(I uſe your own phraſe) is ſuppoſed to
have obtained in conſequence of the weak
conduct of the Adminiſtration in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1128401200:7"/>
If this party,—whoſe general principles,
fidelity of attachment, and openneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
you own you reſpect—but own it with
the ſplenetic reluctance of one who has been
in vain endeavouring to look for ſyſtem, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or plain dealing elſewhere—If this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had no other object but to retort popular
invectives, to detect the ſiniſter views of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
adverſaries, to leſſen the confidence of
Parliament in their meaſures, or to ſhake the
opinion of their conſequence in another quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
there undoubtedly was cauſe for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
triumph in the late events:—and of
ſtill fairer triumph, perhaps, in the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
afforded of vindicating their own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
under circumſtances of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and upon grounds the moſt embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to their opponents. But underſtanding,
as I truſt I do, the terms and conditions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which alone that party will ever ſeek to
obtain, or conſent to hold, miniſterial ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this country, I never ſhall admit that
their cauſe can be eſſentially advanced by any
legiſlative meaſure which tends to lower the
Houſe of Commons in the public eſtimation,
and to deprive Parliament of the reſpect and
confidence of the country.</p>
            <p>Upon ſuch occaſions, whatever advantage
this or that ſet of men may gain in debate,
or in public opinion,—<hi>Their</hi>'s only is the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
who love not the popular part of our
Conſtitution, whoſe credit and whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1128401200:8"/>
proſper in the abaſement of all popular
character, and who would at any time be
content to participate in the reproach of an
odious meaſure, provided it reflected ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
diſgrace on Parliament, as the inſtrument
of effecting it.—But I am getting upon
ground which may lead us from the ſubject
I wiſh to preſs to your more immediate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.—I ſhall therefore only add, that
I am,</p>

            <head>COPY of a PAPER read by Mr.
Sheridan in the HOUSE OF COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS,
on <hi>Friday</hi> the 14th Day of
March, 1788.</head>
            <p>THE PROFESSED OBJECT of the Two Bills
for the better Government of the Britiſh Poſſeſſions
in India, brought into Parliament, the one by Mr.
FOX, in 1783, and the other by Mr. PITT, in
1784, was to relieve the Natives of that Country,
from the many evils which they had experienced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Dominion of, or in conſequence of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
with, the Government of the Company of the
United Merchants trading to the Eaſt-Indies. It
was aſſumed by the Framers of both Bills, that this
Relief was not to be expected from the Government
of the Company, conſtituted as it then was; and it
was admitted by both, that the Patronage and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Company ought not to be transferred to the
Crown.</p>

the Directors to be appointed under Mr. Fox's

ſecurity; and the event has ſhewn that they could
not have taken a worſe. This cannot be placed in
a ſtronger light than by ſuppoſing that Lord Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>william,

them; had ſolicited to be reſtrained from the power
of diſſipating the Company's revenue, and creating
a Military Patronage at <hi>their</hi> expence; had taken
credit for tying up their own hands in their own

               </p>
               <p>With theſe inſtances, thus briefly ſtated, ſelected

                  <hi>reward</hi> and <hi>puniſhment, military promotion,</hi>
and <hi>the purſe</hi> of the Company; will it be credited,
that any many ſhould have been ſtout enough to
aſſert in the Houſe of Commons, that <q rend="inline">the <hi>whole
buſineſs of Patronage</hi> was left <hi>excluſively</hi> in the
hands of the <hi>Company,</hi> and that the Board of
Controul would not even take it if it were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them!!!</q>
               </p>
               <p>In truth, the queſtion, <q rend="inline">Whether or not the
preſent Board of Controul poſſeſs the whole, or
any ſhare of the Patronage in India?</q> has lately
been placed in a plainer light by the unguarded
confeſſions of thoſe who ſupported the Declaratory
Bill, than by any thing that could be ſaid by thoſe
who oppoſed it. Some gentlemen defined the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1128401200:25"/>
of the Board on this head to be, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>a power
of circuitous nomination</hi>;</q> others, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>appointment
by the weight of influence</hi>;</q> others, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>the right of
authoritative recommendation</hi>;</q> but by whatever
name it is called, or however the exerciſe of it
may be diſclaimed, theſe facts are plain, 1ſt, That
all the unbounded means of Patronage and Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which the <hi>Governor General</hi> and the Preſidents
of the different Councils poſſeſs, belong to thoſe
to whom in reality they owe their appointments,
and to whom only in fact they owe obedience.
2dly, That the Board of Controul are obviouſly
ſeizing the whole of the <hi>Military</hi> Patronage into
their own hands, the intention of extinguiſhing the
Company's ſervice being plainly avowed. 3dly,
That no perſon can look for protection to any
quarter but to <hi>the Board,</hi> or think of accepting any
appointment againſt <hi>their</hi> will, in the <hi>civil</hi> line.</p>
               <p>One diſtinction, however, is conſtantly taken
upon this ſubject, namely, that Mr. Pitt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
do not meddle with the <hi>Patronage at
home,</hi> which it is affirmed would have been at the
diſpoſal of Lord Fitzwilliam's Board, under Mr.
Fox's Bill. This Patronage, whatever it is, is
always magnified, and never explained. As far as
it means the nomination of Clerks, and other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
at the India Houſe, it is not an object very
much worth diſpute: but as far as it relates to
contracts, and money laid out in ſhipping and trade
at home, it ſhould not be forgotten, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of theſe matters was not placed in Lord
Fitzwilliam's Board, by Mr. Fox's Bill, but in a
Board of <hi>Aſſiſtant Directors,</hi> appointed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from among the then exiſting Directors or
Proprietors of India Stock, for that ſpecial pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Theſe Aſſiſtant Directors, however, being
bound to obey the orders of the Superior Board,
Lord Fitzwilliam <hi>might</hi> have commanded their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1128401200:26"/>
Patronage, and perverted their commercial deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to his own political purpoſes—granted—there
was certainly no ſecurity againſt ſo flagrant an
abuſe of truſt, but in the character of the perſon
truſted; and what reaſon is there to think that the
preſent Board of Controul have no weight of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
with reſpect to this very Patronage, if they
choſe to act as they ſuppoſe Lord Fitzwilliam would
have done? Or, who is there that does not ſee that
the Court of Directors are becoming every day
mere inſtruments in the hands of this Board, and
that there can be nothing of excluſive Patronage
belonging to them, more than would have belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Aſſiſtant Directors under Mr. Fox's Bill?
In plain ſenſe, the whole and only difference, in
point of Patronage, between the two Boards, is,
that by Mr. Fox's Bill it was given <hi>directly,</hi> and
muſt have been exerciſed <hi>openly</hi>; by Mr. Pitt's
Bill it is given <hi>circuitouſly,</hi> and may be exerciſed
<hi>ſecretly.</hi>

<hi>King in Council,</hi> which Mr. Pitt's Bill declares it
ſhall be <hi>lawful</hi> for the Court of Directors to make,
whenever they conceive the orders of the Board
not to <hi>relate</hi> to <hi>points connected</hi> with the Civil or
Military Government and Revenues in India, is a
ſtrange mockery, when gravely held out to the
Company as a ſecurity againſt encroachment or
interference in Commercial matters, on the part
of the Board of Controul. It proves, however,
how perfectly diſtinct, in theory at leaſt, the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of this Bill conſidered the Board of Controul,
from the general executive government of the
country:—the limits of the authority of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors
are circumſcribed within certain bounds,
and if they tranſgreſs them, or refuſe obedience
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1128401200:27"/>
where the law has commanded them to pay it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
is provided in the common courſe of law.
The law alſo preſcribes limits to the authority and
controul of the Commiſſioners; but it provides no
redreſs ſhould they tranſgreſs them. The moſt
flagrant abuſe of their truſt under their own Bill,
would be in any inſtance to aſſume the management
of the Company's Commerce; yet if they can
craftily effect this, they may do it with impunity;
and whenever they are oppoſed, if they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the ſanction of the Council on their ſide, that
is, fairly ſpeaking, of themſelves in a different
character—they have the law on their ſide alſo!</p>
               <p>But there is nothing more curious than to obſerve
the prepoſterous and degrading office which theſe
zealous advocates for the dignity and prerogatives
of the Crown, have provided for the Monarch, were
ever ſuch an appeal to be made.—His Majeſty, in
Council, ſhall decide, <q rend="inline">whether the diſpatch, or
order, referred to his Royal judgment, be, or be
not, connected with the <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Military</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and <hi>Revenues</hi> of the territories and
poſſeſſions in India;</q> and this deciſion is to be
made upon ſuch ſtatements and information as the
parties ſhall condeſcend to favour him with, upon
ſubjects wholly removed from the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of his Majeſty's Government. Mr.
Dundas aſſerts, that the meaſure propoſed belongs
to <hi>his department excluſively</hi>—being a meaſure relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>war,</hi> or <hi>peace,</hi> or <hi>negociation</hi> or <hi>revenue</hi>; and
that therefore his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> ought to have
been implicitly obeyed. The Directors humbly
contend, without preſuming to queſtion the <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignity</hi>
of the Board of Controul, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is of a <hi>Commercial</hi> nature merely.—His Majeſty
ſits the unprincely umpire between his contending
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1128401200:28"/>
ſubjects, deciding upon the extent of Imperial
prerogatives, in the exerciſe of which he has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will nor voice.</p>
               <p>But, if any thing further were wanting to ſhew
the falacy of this pretended ſecurity to the rights
of the Company, we find it amply made out in the
notable device of compelling the <hi>Directors to eſtabliſh</hi>
a <hi>Secret Committee,</hi> to be <hi>ſolely under the orders of
the Board of Controul.</hi> The Secret Committee was
accordingly ſoon employed contrary to the profeſſed
purpoſe of its inſtitution; and it was as ſoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
that the whole affair of an appeal to the
King in Council, might at once be evaded by the
Board of Controul directing, through their Secret
Agents, as matter <hi>connected</hi> with <hi>revenue</hi> or <hi>negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
whatever <hi>commercial</hi> arrangement they pleaſed.—But it occurred to no man, that the Board would
be ſo unwary, at leaſt till the ſyſtem ſhould be
more fully eſtabliſhed, as to endeavour to adopt a
precedent for a right of <hi>direct controul</hi> and <hi>manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
over <hi>commercial</hi> matters, without cover or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
by means of or in colluſion with, the Secret
Committee: yet has this already been the caſe.
The Secret Committee, (to whom, however, no
<hi>intentional</hi> ill-conduct is meant to be imputed,) on
the firſt of June 1786, aſſume, in concert with the
Board of Controul, powers from which both by
law and the nature of their truſt, they were equally
excluded. They take upon themſelves to direct a
<hi>purchaſe of cotton</hi> to be made at Bombay, for expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to China, and order five ſhips to receive the
cargo; and direct the remittance of a conſiderable
ſum from home, to anſwer the expence, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the authority or knowledge of the Directors.
The Board of Controul approve the meaſure, and

called in the Houſe of Commons,—"<hi>blindly lending

The differences which have ſubſiſted between the
Court of Directors and the Board of Controul, have
not been upon <hi>meaſures,</hi> or upon <hi>matters of opinion,</hi>
or upon trivial points; but all of them upon queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>right,</hi> of <hi>law,</hi> and upon the <hi>nature</hi> and
<hi>limits</hi> of their reſpective <hi>powers.</hi> Such differences,
however, will probably no more be heard of.—The laſt ineffectual ſtruggle of the Company ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have been made. In one diſpute they
tried in vain to obtain the Miniſter's countenance
to apply to the Repreſentatives of the People to
arbitrate between them and the Board of Controul.
In another, they requeſted to be permitted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the King;—this was alſo refuſed. In the
laſt, they looked for redreſs in an appeal to the
Courts of Juſtice; in this they were fruſtrated by
the Legiſlature being induced to think it proper to
decide the point, and <hi>declare</hi> the law againſt them.
Thus circumſtanced, ſhut out from Law, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Throne, it is but reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Court of Directors will no more
be heard of, but as an inſtrument to ſerve the

and characters of men have been often miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
and miſunderſtood through the efforts and
prejudices of party; but it is a moſt ſingular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
that nearly a whole nation ſhould have
been perſuaded to underſtand a Bill paſſed in the
Houſe of Commons, and given to the public in
print, in a manner directly contrary to its plain
meaning and expreſs proviſions; and that even
ſober and rational men ſhould have joined in the
outcry againſt it, without giving themſelves the
trouble to examine whether it really was the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
which it was repreſented to be.</p>
               <p>Whatever other faults were found with Mr.
Fox's Bill, nothing certainly operated more in
the clamour that was raiſed againſt it, than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
notion that it ſome way or other attacked the
prerogatives of the Crown, and aimed to take from
the King certain powers and authorities which of
right belonged to him. This idea, whether urged
by the mob as <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>an attempt to take the Crown from
the King's head,</hi>
                  </q> or, in the politer jargon, of a
<q rend="inline">

                     <hi>imperium in imperio,</hi>
                  </q> was
certainly a main ingredient in the deluſion which
pervaded the country at the laſt general election.
Yet is it utterly impoſſible for any man of common
ſenſe to read the Bill <hi>attentively,</hi> without being
puzzled to gueſs at the ground upon which ſuch a
deception could ſo long have been maintained.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fox's Bill enacted in fact nothing new of any
ſort with reſpect to the Royal Authority; nor did it
contain any one thing in derogation of any one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of the Crown. If the exiſtence of <hi>Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
for the management of the affairs of the Eaſt India</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1128401200:33"/>
                  <hi>Company</hi> conſtituted a <hi>fourth Eſtate,</hi> that fourth
eſtate exiſted before; and this very phraſe is to be
found in pamphlets written againſt this very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
twenty years ſince. If a <hi>parliamentary</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of perſons to be concerned in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of India, was an <hi>attack upon the conſtitution,</hi> the
conſtitution had ſuſtained and ſurvived a ſimilar
attack in the Regulating Act of 1773, and in the
ſubſequent Bills which repeated thoſe <hi>Parliamentary</hi>
appointments. If the employing the Patronage of
the Company, without the King's authority, was
an <hi>invaſion of his prerogative,</hi> it was of a prerogative
never heard of, for the Crown had never had the
grant of a ſingle office, civil or military, belonging
to the ſervice of the Eaſt India Company. In fact
ſo far as the Crown was concerned at all, it acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the right of nominating to the vacant offices
in the new commiſſion, a power the King had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
poſſeſſed before. Whether the <hi>new</hi> Directors
for the affairs of India were likely to make a <hi>better
government</hi> than the <hi>old,</hi> is not the queſtion; the
extraordinary circumſtance is, that this Bill, which
left the Crown <hi>in the full poſſeſſion of its prerogatives</hi>
of <hi>war, peace,</hi> and <hi>negotiation</hi> in India, ſhould have
been repreſented as <hi>depriving it of its juſt rights,</hi> and
raiſing a <hi>Parliamentary commuſſion above its authority</hi>;
and that Mr. Pitt's Bill, which <hi>actually ſtrips the
Throne</hi> of thoſe main enſigns of <hi>Imperial authority</hi>;
ſhould have been univerſally admitted at leaſt to
have the merit of a <hi>due deference to the rights and
perſon of the Sovereign!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, when people are preſſed to explain
what their meaning is—they are compelled to own,
that when they ſpeak of a <hi>fourth eſtate,</hi> and an <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
of the conſtitution,</hi> and an <hi>attack upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi>
they do not mean that all this was done,
or attempted by the Bill, but—that theſe things
<hi>might</hi> have come to paſs in conſequence of it;—<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1128401200:34"/>
becauſe, ſay they, a great political party having
got poſſeſſion of the <hi>Patronage</hi> of India for four
years, they would inſtantly have become ſo ſtrong,
that the King could not eaſily have diſmiſſed them;
and ſo the <hi>prerogative would have been invaded.</hi> This
party would alſo in time, by means of this Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
have been able to obtain a predominant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Parliament; and ſo the <hi>conſtitution would have
been deſtroyed.</hi> Now, to make any ſenſe of the firſt
objection, it is neceſſary to aſſert, as all violent
people did, that, although the King ſhe ſhould have
thought proper to have diſmiſſed the <hi>Duke of Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's
Adminiſtration,</hi> and had been equally deſirous
of changing the <hi>Indian Adminiſtration,</hi> yet that Lord
Fitzwilliam, and his Board, could have held com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
and independent poſſeſſion of the Government
of India for four years, in ſpight of his Royal
wiſhes, and have applied all the Patronage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of their ſituation to the ſupport of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters.
This is literally what every man meant
who meant any thing, or who had any ſincere alarm
on the ſubject. That the mere vulgar, or very
ignorant people, ſhould have adopted this notion,
is not very ſtrange, conſidering the pains which
were taken to circulate it; but that a perſon of
LORD CAMDEN'S character, accuſtomed to conſider
laws with temper and deliberation, ſhould now
again have gravely detailed all this ſort of argument
in the Houſe of Lords, have warned them againſt this
<hi>fourth eſtate,</hi> this <hi>imperium in imperio</hi> aſſerting, as is
reported,<q rend="inline">that had his Majeſty thought proper, by
virtue of his undoubted prerogative, to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed

and perverſe notion before ſtated, that the Board
appointed by it, was placed out of the reach, and
above the controul, of the King's Miniſters for the

Commons, of great ability and character, Mr.

to this part of the Bill; they ſtill, however, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
to argue upon concluſions founded upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged

               <p>What is the real caſe?—Mr. Fox's Bill enacts,
<q rend="inline">that the <hi>ſaid Directors hereby appointed,</hi> or any

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in order to underſtand what the real ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

and under the inſpection of the Commiſſioners
of his Majeſty's Navy, and Office of Ordnance.</hi>
                  </q>—Upon the whole, it would have appeared that their
Board was placed, in every important matter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſo ſtrong a controul of the <hi>Miniſters for the
time being,</hi> and ſo wholly without the power of
acting upon their own judgment or diſcretion, in

that no ſet of men, who were not content from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1128401200:37"/>
the meaneſt motives, to hold the <hi>appearance</hi> of
power upon the moſt abject conditions, could have
remained in their Offices a week, with an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
deſirous to get rid of them. Let theſe
plain facts be once underſtood, let the ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
of the new Directors to the King's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
be fairly examined, and it will be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
at once,—that without having recourſe to a
Parliamentary addreſs,—the Duke of Portland's
Adminiſtration once diſmiſſed, the reſignation of
Lord Fitzwilliam's Board muſt have followed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly;
that is, if it was the object of the adviſers
of the Crown to change the Indian Government;—if <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> undoubtedly Lord Fitzwilliam and
his aſſociates were at liberty to continue in a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
duty, without pay or emolument, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated
from accepting any place of profit from
the Crown, and to ſacrifice their eaſe and their
time under Miniſters with whom they had no bond
of union, nor habits of regard, from a deſire to do
good, and to effect the great pupoſes of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment—the reform of the abuſes in India,
and the re-eſtabliſhment of the Britiſh character.
To execute this truſt faithfully, a rigid ſcrutiny
into paſt miſconduct, a ſevere oeconomy in future
arrangements, a juſt, diſintereſted, and impartial
management of Patronage, would have been among
the firſt duties expected from them. While they
<hi>ſo</hi> acted, if it was the King's pleaſure, his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
whoever they were, might certainly have <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained</hi>
from the exerciſe of the deciſive controul
they poſſeſſed over them; but then, wherein would
have conſiſted the attack on the prerogative, or
the danger of the Conſtitution? But ſuppoſing a
different conduct to have been purſued by the
Board;—that forgetting what they owed to their
own characters, as well as to the duties of their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they had perverted the powers of their truſt,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1128401200:38"/>
and had endeavoured to employ them ſolely to
anſwer party purpoſes at home;—the remedy
was at hand, and the firſt application of it muſt
have been effectual.</p>
               <p>This being the fact, an objection of a different
nature may, no doubt, be inſtantly made, namely,
that as the King was to nominate to <hi>vacancies upon
reſignation,</hi> the Bill might have been uſed not to
<hi>deſtroy,</hi> but to <hi>increaſe</hi> the power of the Crown;—the truth is, that it were much to be wiſhed
that this objection could be as eaſily anſwered as
the other. MR. GRENVILLE was the only perſon
connected with the preſent Adminiſtration, who
argued the Bill upon this ground, at the time of its
paſſing through the Houſe of Commons. The fair
anſwer, however, is, that there was every ſecurity
taken againſt this worſt of miſchiefs, which the
nature of the meaſure itſelf, and the urgent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
which called for it, admitted of. The public
had a pledge in the characters of the perſons who
framed that Bill, in the whole tenor of their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
life, and in their recent and honeſt exertions
to reduce the influence of the Crown, that it was
not <hi>their</hi> intention at leaſt, to deceive or delude
them upon this ſubject.—If theſe Miniſters were
diſplaced, there was the ſame ſecurity in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Indian Board, and in the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
upon which it had been formed. If <hi>they</hi>
too were obliged to abandon their ſituation, theſe
ſecurities certainly vaniſhed; and the Crown might,
<hi>for whatever term remained of the four years,</hi> have
placed the powers given to the Parliamentary truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,
in the hands of its own creatures. But this
could not have been done <hi>ſecretly</hi> or <hi>ſilently</hi>—not
without ſerious diſcuſſion—not without the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Public being immediately and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
drawn to the ſubject and to the characters
and principles of the new Board; no new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1128401200:39"/>
could pretend to claim the confidence
of a Parliamentary nomination; Parliament muſt
therefore have had the matter before them in a
new point of view and have become acceſſory to
the ſurrender, if they were to be ſurrendered, of
thoſe powers and that patronage to the Crown,—which all parties profeſſed ſo much to dread to ſee
lodged there.—Againſt ſuch a conduct in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
there is certainly no remedy, nor ever
will be.</p>
               <p>The only thing like an objection on this head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
is, that upon a ſuppoſition that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
had been pleaſed to continue the Duke of
Portland's Adminiſtration for the term of four years,
for which the India Board was appointed, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
good underſtanding between the Miniſters
and the new India Government, would have given
them an opportunity of uſing the Company's influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Patronage, to make friends, and to create
an intereſt which might have been of uſe to them
at the end of that term. This undoubtedly <hi>might</hi>
have been the caſe, but not without an abuſe of
their truſt; and againſt this the public had certainly
no ſecurity but in the character of the Board. In
a compariſon, however, of the two Bills, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to aſk,—what ſecurity have the public againſt
the ſame thing now? The means of Patronage
and influence to all important purpoſes were before
proved to be equal; and if Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das

Nothing could be more clearly out of the ſpirit
and meaning of the Act of 1784, than this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
The Board of Controul had already aſſumed
an arbitrary power of ſettling the debts due from
the Nabob to <hi>individuals,</hi> as <hi>matter connected with
revenue.</hi> The Directors conceived they might at
leaſt have been permitted to ſettle <hi>their own</hi> debt,
which was their property, and ſtated as part of
their effects to Parliament; but this was diſcovered
to be—<hi>matter connected with negociation.</hi> The Board
of Controul had no power to iſſue their orders,
through the <hi>Secret Committee,</hi> with reſpect to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>revenue</hi>; but with reſpect to <hi>treaties</hi> with
<hi>native Princes,</hi> they had: accordingly the ſettling
a ſufficient ſecurity for an old and public debt to
the Company, due from a dependent on their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
was converted into <hi>a negociation of ſtate,</hi>
deemed a matter of ſecreſy, and withdrawn even
from the knowledge of thoſe who alone had any
title to the debt. The Directors apply to their
Counſel; and they are truly informed by Mr. Rous,
that <q rend="inline">the whole effect of the laſt Regulating Bill,
in conſtituting the two Boards of Directors and
of Commiſſioners, the one propoſing meaſures,
and the other, after repreſentation, finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding,
will be loſt, as far as concerns the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Madras, <hi>if the intercourſe with the
Nabob ſhall be confined to the Secret Department</hi>;
becauſe this intercourſe involves directly, the
arrangements reſpecting the military force, and
indirectly, <hi>every intereſt of that ſettlement.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The diſpute comes before the Court of Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who reſolve, on the 30th of June 1786,—<q rend="inline">that the conſtruction of the Act of the 24th of
his preſent Majeſty, under which the Right

               <p>It was farther <hi>reſolved unanimouſly,</hi>

At the ſame time, however, with a very natural

and Deputy Chairman, are directed to wait
on the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and propoſe
the following queſtion: <q rend="inline">If the Court of Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

will <hi>you</hi> aſſiſt them in their application?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here ſeems to have been a reaſonable caſe made

<q rend="inline">a material difference of opinion between the

                  <hi>Agree upon its Meaning.</hi>] THE Declaratory Law
was defended by many, upon the ground of its
declaring no more power to be in the Board of
Controul than it was fit and reaſonable to give them;
and that to ſuppoſe that the Original Act had given
them leſs, was to admit that Parliament had enacted
an abſurd and inconſiſtent law. This argument,
altho' a popular one, and ſanctioned—altho' a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
one—by LORD HAWKESBURY, is an intolerably
bad argument when applied to Parliament, acting
in a great meaſure in their judicial capacity: It is
to ſet up their pride againſt their juſtice; and to
pique them to commit an act of violence, rather
than confeſs an act of folly. Other Members,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1128401200:46"/>
however, in both Houſes of Parliament profeſſed
that <hi>they</hi> ſupported the Declaratory Law, as a true
conſtruction of Mr. Pitt's Bill, from a recollection
of <hi>their own meaning</hi> at the time they voted for it.
Yet few of theſe Members agreed with each other,
as to the powers they conceived they <hi>had</hi> given to
the Board of Controul. LORD CAMDEN having
been out of the kingdom when the Act of 1784
paſſed, profeſſed to have nothing to ſay to the <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the Legiſlature in paſſing the Act, but to
have formed <hi>his</hi> opinion upon <q rend="inline">the plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
meaning of <hi>the clauſes taken collectively.</hi>
                  </q>
The learned Lord was obliged, however, to admit,
that there were many words omitted which were
neceſſary to make out his inſtruction, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others inſerted which directly contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; but this he preſumed to have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through <hi>inadvertency</hi>; and therefore a whole
clauſe coming under the latter deſcription—<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>nil operatur.</hi>
                  </q> A new and moſt extraordinary
mode, the moſt unlearned man may venture to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
of interpreting laws affecting the rights and
property of the ſubject!</p>
               <p>But the pleaſanteſt ground was taken by the
DUKE of RICHMOND. The noble Duke declared
he had voted <hi>againſt</hi> Mr. Pitt's Bill, becauſe he
<hi>differed</hi> at the time from thoſe who had introduced
it with reſpect to its meaning. <hi>He</hi> thinking that it
<hi>did</hi> actually give thoſe powers to the Board of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul,
which <hi>they</hi> aſſerted were <hi>not</hi> meant to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It now therefore appearing that they had
come over to <hi>his</hi> opinion, <hi>conſiſtency</hi> demanded from
him to give vigour and efficacy to a law—which
juſtice and policy had convinced him ought never
to have exiſted.</p>
               <p>It would certainly be a difficult taſk to argue on
the <hi>intentions</hi> of different Members at the time the
Act of 1784 paſſed, and a very unfair way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with reſpect to any but thoſe who publicly gave
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1128401200:47"/>
their enterpretation of the Bill, during its progreſs.
Mr. BASTARD'S quotations from the Miniſter's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſpeeches ſeem to have been generally admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have contained a true expoſition of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's
former meaning; but there is one deciſive
teſt eaſily recurred to, which was very ably argued
upon by Mr. POWIS; namely, to compare the
Bill in the ſtate in which it was <hi>firſt</hi> brought into
the Houſe by Mr. Pitt, with <hi>that</hi> to which he altered
it, after a diſcuſſion with the Directors, in the
Committee. Here it will deciſively appear that
many of theſe very powers which are <hi>now</hi> contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be given to the Board of Controul, by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>
and <hi>implication,</hi> were <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>plainly</hi>
given in the Bill as <hi>it ſtood on its firſt reading,</hi> and
were afterwards withdrawn or modified upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
and <hi>explanation</hi> with theſe who objected to
them, as intrenching on right which they had not
conſented to yield.—This evidence is concluſive.</p>
               <p>" <hi>Explain the original Act</hi>—"] THERE is no
inſtance, perhaps, wherein the extraordinary ſpirit
in which Mr. Pitt's Bill is worded, appears more
plainly than in its bold and irregular manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
matters ſuppoſed to be inconſiſtent with the
new enactments.</p>
               <p>In all the former Acts we find a regard to perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
and fair dealing, expreſſed as in the Act of
21ſt of the preſent King. <q rend="inline">And be it further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by the authority aforeſaid, that <hi>all and every
the rights,</hi> intereſts, powers, privileges, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
which are now veſted in the ſaid Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to the Eaſt Indies, and <hi>which are</hi> NOT <hi>hereby</hi> EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESSLY

This is the language of laws that mean to be
intelligible, and to do juſtice,</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitt's Bill ſettles the point in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:—<q rend="inline">And be it further enacted, that all ſuch

ſhall be, and the ſame are hereby
REPEALED; any thing contained in any Act or

of a Britiſh law upon ſuch a ſubject, there is
any one <hi>right, power,</hi> or <hi>property</hi> of any ſort, left
to the Company, may reaſonably be doubted;
indeed ſince the conſtruction given to "THIS ACT,"
by the Declaratory Law, it is difficult to imagine
any power ever exerciſed by them, which might
not be proved in a court of juſtice to be <hi>repugnant
to ſomething</hi> contained in Mr. Pitt's Bill.</p>

Miniſters ſhould be graciouſly diſpoſed to allow a

excluſive trade, and ſtating the conſideration paid
<q rend="inline">for the ſervice of the Crown of England, <hi>entitling
them to theſe advantages,</hi>
                  </q> conclude in theſe words:—<q rend="inline">Provided always, and it is hereby further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
that nothing in the above proviſo, or in
any proviſo in the ſaid Act of the ninth year of
the reign of his ſaid late Majeſty King William
the Third, or in the ſaid charter of the fifth day
of September, in the tenth year of his ſaid late
Majeſty's reign, or in any other act or charter
contained, ſhall extend, or be conſtrued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
to <hi>determine the Corporation</hi> of the ſaid
United Company of Merchants of England
trading to the Eaſt Indies; or to <hi>hinder, prevent,</hi>
or <hi>exclude</hi> the ſaid United Company from carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on AT ALL TIMES <hi>after ſuch determination of
the right to the ſole, whole, and excluſive trade,</hi> as
aforeſaid, a FREE TRADE in, to, and from the
Eaſt Indies, and parts aforeſaid, with all, or any
part of their <hi>own joint ſtock</hi> in trade, goods
merchandizes, eſtate, and effects, IN COMMON
with OTHER THE SUBJECTS OF HIS MAJESTY,
his heirs and ſucceſſors, trading, in, to, or from
thoſe parts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1128401200:50"/>
After this, to enact a law to place them in their
corporate capacity as merchants united to trade
<q rend="inline">upon their own joint ſtock and eſtate,</q> (without
any excluſive right or protection from Government
whatever,) under the <hi>perpetual controul</hi> of certain
Commiſſioners <hi>named by the Crown,</hi> to whom they
are bound <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>to communicate all their tranſactions,</hi>
                  </q>
and without whoſe ſignature they can iſſue no one
commercial order, is ſurely a moſt flagrant and
wanton violation of private property, as well as
public faith, and indeed of every right that law or
charter can be ſuppoſed to ſecure to any one.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the Company's <hi>claim</hi> on the <hi>terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial
revenues,</hi> the breach of faith is the ſame.—The Company paid the public a certain ſum upon
the laſt ſettlement on this ſubject, and it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
<q rend="inline">that all the territorial acquiſitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
lately obtained in the Eaſt Indies ſhall
remain in the poſſeſſion of the United Company
of Merchants of England trading to the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
for, and during the term of the excluſive
trade granted to the ſaid United Company.</q> It
was ſtipulated, however, that beſide the ſum paid
a further proportion of the ſurplus profits of theſe
revenues ſhould be <q rend="inline">ſet apart, and applied for <hi>the
uſe of the public,</hi>
                  </q> with this reſerve, <q rend="inline">ſo long as
the Company ſhall be entitled to the <hi>ſole</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive</hi>
trade.</q>—21ſt George III.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe terms the <hi>queſtion of right</hi> between
the <hi>public</hi> and the <hi>Company</hi> was <hi>ſuſpended</hi> until the
expiration of the charter of monopoly. And the
ſaving clauſe which had been inſerted in all former
Acts relating to this point was repeated. Clauſe
83. <q rend="inline">Provided always, and be it enacted, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
herein contained ſhall extend, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued
to extend, to prejudice or affect the rights,
or the claims of the public, or <hi>the ſaid United
Company,</hi> reſpecting the ſaid territorial acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and <hi>revenues.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1128401200:51"/>
The right of the Company under this compact
is—not to <hi>the property</hi> of the revenues certainly,
but to a <hi>deciſion</hi> upon the ſubject on the expiration
of their charter of excluſive trade, or to be placed
in the ſame ſituation with <hi>reſpect to their claim</hi> in
which they ſtood when they made their bargain.
In lieu of this, a <hi>new Claimant</hi> is created by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
being <hi>neither the public</hi> nor the <hi>Company,</hi>
to whom the law gives the <hi>perpetual diſpoſal</hi> of theſe
revenues ſo claimed by the public on one part, and
the Company on the other. For it is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered,
(granting the Board of Controul to be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Crown) that the King is <hi>not</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative
of the <hi>Public,</hi> with reſpect to their
<hi>property</hi> and <hi>purſe</hi>; but that on the contrary the
Conſtitution regards with jealouſy, and places
no truſt in the Crown upon that head; ſo that
the <hi>Public</hi> would be defrauded, although the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
were to come under the diſpoſal of the
<hi>King.</hi> But even that is not the caſe; for the
Board of Controul can appropriate them <hi>without
the direction of the Crown,</hi> as well as without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Company, or of Parliament. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
therefore breaks its faith to the Company,
without doing juſtice to the Public; and the title
and claims of both are extinguiſhed, not in favour
of the Crown, but in favour of a FOURTH ESTATE,
which acquires the ſtrange and anomalous right ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of diſpoſing of the PROPERTY OF INDIVIDU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ALS,
againſt their conſent, or of applying the PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERTY
OF THE STATE without the ſanction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
