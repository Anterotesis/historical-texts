            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS FOR THE RECOVERY OF PERSONS <hi>APPARENTLY DEAD</hi> BY DROWNING, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Reports of ſeveral eſtabliſhments on the Continent, as well as of the Humane Society in London, have fully proved, that perſons apparently dead from drowning, or ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from other cauſes, may, by proper means, be reſtored to life. But whilſt the ſucceſs which has attended theſe eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, muſt give pleaſure to every perſon intereſted in the cauſe of humanity; yet it is to be regretted, that the means of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration have not been more publicly underſtood, and more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally adopted.</p>
            <p>The frequent inſtances of death, by drowning, which have happened upon the river Tyne, and the unſucceſsful attempts of recovery, have afforded the ſtrongeſt proofs, that the methods of reſtoration have not been known to the public, or have not been ſpeedily or properly applied.</p>
            <p>In order to give relief to perſons in ſuch unfortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in this town and neighbourhood, the Governors of the NEWCASTLE DISPENSARY have eſtabliſhed a department of their Charity, on the following plan, for the recovery of the vital motions, when ſuſpended by drowning; and, to render this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment more uſeful, they have alſo extended it to the methods of reſtoration in other caſes of apparent death.</p>

            <head type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <list>
               <item>1. THE MEDICAL SOCIETY of Newcaſtle, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the requeſt of the GOVERNORS of the Diſpenſary, have inveſtigated the nature of <hi>apparent death,</hi> ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the cauſes which become the object of the preceding plan, with care and attention: And, in the following Remarks, they have chiefly ſtudied conciſeneſs, plainneſs, and preciſion, that the public, at large, may underſtand a ſubject, in which they are ſo peculiarly intereſted.</item>
               <item>2. Apparent death conſiſts in a total, tho' temporary ceſſation of all the powers of motion and ſenſe; to be more particular, the lungs ceaſe to act; the heart and arteries to beat; and the brain and nerves to diffuſe their energy. It, therefore, only differs from real death, in this, that the living principle is not extinct, but only lies dormant; which, ſometimes ſpontaneouſly, but more frequently and certainly, when excited by proper means, again becomes active: In conſequence of which, all the functions of life are reſtored.</item>
               <item>3. The common opinion, that life deſerts the body as ſoon as the breath ceaſes, is not confined to the vulgar alone; but, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the inſtances of recovery from apparent death, is ſtill belleved by many of the more diſcerning part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. As this opinion has been productive of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequences, the SOCIETY wiſh to impreſs the public with the following truth; that the living principle, in every caſe of death, keeps poſſeſſion of the body for ſome time, at leaſt, after all the actions of life have diſappeared; nay, probably, it never entirely leaves the body, ſo long as any degree of animal heat remains in the internal parts.</item>
               <item>4. By proper attention to theſe circumſtances (2.3.), the SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETY flatter themſelves, that perſons ſuddenly and apparently
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0002100400:6"/>dead, eſpecially from the cauſes, to be afterwards enumerated, will, for the future, not be conſidered to be <hi>really</hi> dead, till ſuch time as the methods of reſtoration have had a fair trial.</item>
               <item>5. But whilſt the SOCIETY endeavour to animate the public, to uſe every exertion to recover thoſe apparently dead, they do not wiſh to conceal the great uncertainty of a ſucceſsful termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. In drowning, eſpecially, the methods of treatment prove unſucceſsful, from the perſon lying too long under water; from his being ſuddenly ſeized with other diſeaſes, or being in a ſtate of intoxication, at the time of the accident; and from vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous other cauſes. But, in ſuch dangerous ſituations, if <hi>one</hi> in <hi>fifty</hi> can be reſtored, it will amply compenſate for many fruitleſs attempts. If, however, any perſon conceive this to be a ſmall proportion, let him but for a moment conſider, if this <hi>one</hi> ſhould happen to be his own ſon, or a beloved friend, with what raptures he would extol the means which had averted the moſt poignant diſtreſs!</item>
            </list>
            <div type="part">
               <head>On the Nature of APPARENT DEATH from DROWN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, and on the moſt effectual Methods of Recovery.</head>
               <p n="6">6. From various experiments, inſtituted by different members of the SOCIETY, the following appearances have been obſerved to take place in drowning, to which the attention of the reader is requeſted, as not only pointing out the nature of the death, but the methods, which ought to be employed to effect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When an animal is kept under water, in a few ſeconds it begins to emit its breath forcibly, ſo as to occaſion air bubbles. This emiſſion of air from its lungs is followed with as ſtrong a deſire to draw in air, and in theſe efforts, it commonly inſpires water<note n="(a)" place="bottom">As it was thought of conſequence to aſcertain this point; a cat, ſix weeks old, was frequently immerſed in a ſtrong ſolution of copperas, and as frequently allowed to come above the ſurface, to inſpire, in order to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate what frequently happens in drowning. It was at laſt brought up, before it was dead, and inſtantly ſtrangled. Upon diſſection, the frothy fluid in the lungs, and the lungs themſelves, became as black as ink, upon adding a tea-ſpoon full of infuſion of galls to the former, and moiſtening the lungs with a little of the ſame infuſion. The experiment, with the ſame reſult, was repeated on a young whelp.</note>. Its ſtruggles, in a few minutes, become impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and it falls down motionleſs. Upon taking it out of the water, provided only eight or ten minutes have elapſed after all its ſtruggles are over, the noſe and mouth appear remarkably pale, the eyes do not protrude, and the pupils, tho' they nearly retain their natural luſtre, are quite dilated; all ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both external and internal, except a ſlight contraction of the right ſide of the heart, are now loſt; and if no means of recovery
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0002100400:7"/>he made uſe of, the body gradually becomes cold, and with the loſs of heat, the heart loſes the power of contraction.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Upon diſſection, no fulneſs in the veſſels within the ſkull, nor any diſeaſe in the brain, or its membranes, are to be found. The lungs alſo appear ſound; are generally about half diſtended, but ſometimes more, when the animal is frequently allowed to come to the ſurface of the water, ſo that he may inſpire. A quantity of frothy fluid<note n="(b)" place="bottom">By drowning a large old cat, and a kitten of four weeks old, in a ſolution of copperas, one ounce of frothy fluid was found in the air veſſels of the lungs of the former; and one dram and a half of the ſame fluid in the latter: By adding a ſtrong infuſion of galls, the fluid in both became black, and as near as could be aſcertained, the quantity of ſolution of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras, in the lungs of the former amounted to two drams; and in the latter to two ſcruples. But, in one experiment, made by another member of the Society, the water in the lungs of a drowned whelp of five weeks old, was much more conſiderable; and water was alſo found in its ſtomach.</note>, conſiſting of mucus, with a little of the water in which the animal was drowned, in every experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment except one, was ſqueezed from the lungs.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The right-ſide of the heart is full of black blood, and the large veins going out from this ſide of the heart, thro' their whole courſe, to the middle of the thighs, the arm-pits, and almoſt to the jaws, are full of blood of the ſame colour. The left-ſide of the heart is almoſt empty, which is alſo the caſe with the whole of the large arteries, except the trunks of the artery, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the lungs, which is commonly filled with blood. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal blood-veſſels are empty, and the muſcles commonly look as white as if the animal had been bled to death.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Upon the whole, it appears (8.9.), that no injury is done to the organization of the vital parts; but that the heart and large veins, in its neighbourhood, are diſtended with blood, whilſt every other part ſeems, in a great meaſure, to be drained of that fluid. Nor are theſe circumſtances invalidated by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, which have been obſerved in ſome bodies of drowned perſons, who are never opened till many hours after death; for altho', in a few, the veſſels of the brain have been found full of blood, yet, generally, this organ, as alſo the lungs, have been found in a ſound ſtate. Neither does the prominent, or blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot eye, the ſwelled bloated face, or the lividity of the ſkin, which are ſo often obſerved in drowned perſons, who have been long under water, prove any thing more, than that the blood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, had drained to depending parts.</p>
               <p n="11">11. From what has been advanced, in the three preceding para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, it appears, that the firſt cauſe of the ſuſpenſion of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal motions in drowning, is the ſtoppage of reſpiration; in conſequence of which the circulation cannot be carried on, and the blood, therefore, is accumulated in the right-ſide of the heart, and in all the large internal veins. With this ſtoppage of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0002100400:8"/>circulation, the brain loſes its energy, the body becomes cold, and with the total loſs of heat, it may be reaſonably ſuppoſed that the principle of life is extinguiſhed<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Altho' not immediately connected with the ſubject, the SOCIETY cannot help entering a caution againſt the haſty cuſtom of laying out per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuppoſed to be dead. In great ſinking of the ſtrength, eſpecially in the end of acute diſeaſes, patients frequently lie in a ſtate exactly reſembling death. If the bed-cloaths be removed, the heat, on which the vital princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple depends, will ſoon be diſſipated, and every ſpark of life deſtroyed. By not attending to this circumſtance, it is to be feared, that many have been actually killed, who, by a different treatment, would have recovered.</note>.</p>
               <p n="12">12. From this view of the ſubject, the moſt likely means to reſtore perſons apparently dead by drowning, will conſiſt: 1ſt, in renewing the action of the lungs, without which the accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blood about the heart cannot be removed; nor the heart itſelf be brought into proper motion: And 2d, in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a due degree of animal heat, without which the vital princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot, with effect, exert its influence.</p>
               <p n="13">13. To reſtore the action of the lungs, it is indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they ſhould be inflated. When the perſon has not been long under water, perhaps blowing air into the mouth or noſe with a wooden pipe may be all that is neceſſary to put them into motion. But in many caſes, it will require great ſkill to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flate them effectually. As the directions for doing this with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments will be given in another place<note n="(d)" place="bottom">See the appendix. Paragraph 38, 39, 40, 41.</note>, it would be improper to enlarge on them here. It muſt, however, be obſerved, that the inflation ought not to be done with violence, but ſo as to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate natural, eaſy reſpiration. And as, in many caſes, the infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be continued for one or two hours, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to employ a pair of bellows. But it muſt be obſerved, as ſoon as the pulſe returns, the inflation ſhould be gradually leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and, in a little time, totally laid aſide.</p>
               <p n="14">14. By artificial breathing (13.), judiciouſly and aſſiduouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, not only the frothy fluid, already taken notice of (8.), which renders the recovery from drowning more uncertain than other caſes of ſuffocation, will be expelled; but the heart will moſt likely be put into motion, by which the accumulation of the blood there, and in its neighbourhood (9.10.), will alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the circulation reſtored.</p>
               <p n="15">15 At the ſame time, that the meaſures recommended (13.) are aſſiduouſly employed, other aſſiſtants ſhould be endeavouring to reſtore, and to keep up a due degree of animal heat. Perhaps the ſpeedieſt method of doing this, (were hot water al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in readineſs) would be to put the patient into a warm bath. But as this cannot be ſpeedily procured, but more eſpecially, as it interferes with other eſſential applications, the body muſt be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0002100400:9"/>gradually brought to a proper heat, by placing it on a warm bed, or mattreſs, and by the uſe of general frictions with warm cloaths<note n="(e)" place="bottom">For more particular directions, ſee the Appendix.

The frictions, however, ſhould be at firſt moderate, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only with a view to reſtore heat, and not force the blood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heart, which in drowned perſons is generally found too much diſtended (9.10.).</p>
               <p n="16">16. If the body has been taken out of the water in froſty weather, eſpecially if it has been afterwards long expoſed to the air, the heat, at firſt, ſhould be applied in a very low degree; and if the thermometer be under the freezing point, and the body, when ſtripped, feel cold, and nearly in a condition with thoſe that are frozen; it will, at firſt, be indiſpenſably neceſſary to make uſe of frictions with ſnow, or cold applications, as heat, in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, has been found pernicious. In a little time, however, heat muſt be gradually employed.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Upon the whole, great care and nicety ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the application of heat, which, in every caſe, ought to be proportioned to the powers of life. This is well elucidated by Mr Hunter in the following quotation:—"From obſervation and experiments, it appears to be a law of nature, in animal bodies, that the degree of external heat ſhould bear a proportion to the quantity of life; as it is weakened, this proportion requires great accuracy in the adjuſtment, while greater powers of life allow it greater latitudes. I was led to make theſe obſervations, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to perſons who are froſt-bitten; the effect of cold in this caſe, being that of leſſening the living principle. Heat muſt, at firſt, be gradually applied, and proportioned to the quantity of the living principle; but as that encreaſes, you may encreaſe the degree of heat. If this method is not obſerved, and too great a degree of heat is at firſt applied, the perſon or part loſes entirely the living principle, and mortification enſues. This proceſs invariably takes place with regard to men"<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Animal Oeconomy, p. 121, 122.</note>.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Altho' the recovery of drowned perſons depends almoſt entirely upon the methods recommended (13.15.16.); yet when the body is in a condition to be acted upon, cordial and invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating medicines, ſuch as throwing brandy and water into the ſtomach and inteſtines, pepper-mint water, aether, or ſpirit of hartſhorn, diluted with water, may prove uſeful auxiliaries<note n="(g)" place="bottom">See the Appendix. II. Paragraph 42.</note>. But the ſame moderation in their uſe muſt be obſerved, as has been recommended in the application of heat.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The means for recovering the motion of the lungs, and animal heat, ſhould often be continued for ſeveral hours; for it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0002100400:10"/>appears from the reports of the <hi>Humane Society,</hi> that, in a very great number of caſes, one, two, and even four hours, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveringly employed before the firſt ſigns of life appeared<note n="(h)" place="bottom">In many caſes of complete recovery recorded in the HUMANE SOCIETY, the perſons were under water twenty, thirty, one forty, and one forty-five minutes, and in theſe caſes, the reſtoration, as might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was tedious.</note>.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Electricity being the moſt powerful of all ſtimulants, it has been recommended by ſeveral ingenious authors<note n="(i)" place="bottom">A. Fothergill, Henly, Hunter, Kite.</note>, and, according to the reports of the <hi>Humane Society,</hi> has been found ſerviceable in drowning; it ought, therefore, to be tried, when the heart cannot be brought to act by the means mentioned (14.). Shocks, therefore, may be tranſmitted thro' the heart, the head, and the ſpinal marrow; but they ought neither to be employed ſo gently as to produce no effect, nor ſo violently as to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The SOCIETY being of opinion, that bleeding can be ſeldom employed as the means of recovery, refrain from recommending it in the beginning; but when life returns, and the pulſe will bear ſuch an evacuation, it will frequently become indiſpenſably requifite to remove determinations to the head, and to the lungs; which often take place from an irregular diſtribution of the blood to theſe organs.</p>
               <p n="22">22. As the remarks, which have been already offered, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, with a few exceptions, to other caſes of ſuffocation, the SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETY ſhall briefly diſcuſs the remaining part of the ſubject.</p>

               <p n="23">23. In hanging, the external veſſels, bringing back the blood from the head, are immediately compreſſed, while the blood is ſtill carried on in the internal arteries. The windpipe is ſoon after ſhut by the cord, the ingreſs of air prevented; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, the face becomes red and livid, and the perſon or animal is ſpeedily carried off by ſuffocation.</p>
               <p n="24">24. On diſſection, the blood veſſels of the brain, in ſeveral ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals that were ſtrangled, appeared turgid with blood, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſe was obſerved within the ſkull. The lungs were, in general, quite collapſed, free from frothy fluid, and in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſound. The heart and large adjoining veſſels exhibited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame appearances as in drowned animals (8.9.10.).</p>
               <p n="25">25. From this view (23.24.) it would appear, that, together with bleeding from the jugular veins, or cupping in the neck, the other methods of treatment ought to be the ſame as recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the recovery of drowned perſons.</p>

               <head>APPARENT DEATH from NOXIOUS VAPOURS.</head>
               <p n="26">26. Noxious vapours ariſe from various ſources; from fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting liquors, from the fumes of charcoal, of burning quick lime, and of metals during their calcination; from opening vaults, draw-wells, wells of ſhips, and ditches long ſhut up; from the damps in mines, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="27">27. In the coal-pits of this neighbourhood, there frequently ariſe two kinds of noxious air. The firſt, uſually termed the <hi>choke-damp,</hi> is a natural fixed air, which being ſpecifically heavier than atmoſpheric air, occupies the bottom of the mine. The other is called the <hi>fire-damp,</hi> which is a natural inflammable air, and being ten times lighter than common air, occupies the top of the mine.</p>
               <p n="28">28. From ſome experiments, which would be tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, it appears that theſe vapours (26.) occaſion a ſuſpenſion of the vital motions, and death, by entering the lungs; and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the atmoſpheric air, and in other reſpects (if the <hi>fire-damp</hi> be excepted) when it takes flame<note n="(k)" place="bottom">The <hi>fire-damp</hi> frequently takes flame, by which means the pitmen are often miſerably burnt. At the ſame time, others are ſound without ſigns of life; and as they are erroneouſly ſuppoſed to be burnt to death by the flame, and not ſuffocated by the vapour, methods of reſtoration unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately are ſeldom applied.</note>, no farther injury is done to the body.</p>
               <p n="29">29. The bodies of animals, ſuffocated in theſe vapours, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the following appearances:—The limbs remain flexible for a long time; the eyes retain their luſtre; the temperature of the body, and even a heat higher than the healthy ſtandard, in ſome inſtances, continue ſeveral hours after death. This is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the caſe with animals ſuffocated in the ſteams of charcoal; and in them the blood remains fluid, and even highly florid. In animals ſuffocated in fixed, and in inflammable air, altho' the limbs continue flexible, the blood was not florid. The veſſels of the brain were found turgid in animals ſuffocated in theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; the lungs were ſound; the heart and adjoining veſſels were equally turgid as in thoſe which were drowned or hanged.</p>
               <p n="30">30. The moſt effectual means of recovering the vital actions, when ſuſpended by noxious vapours, conſiſt in inflating the lungs as ſoon as the body is removed to the open air; in ſprinkling the face, and, when the heat is above the ſtandard of health, even the whole body, with cold water. In perſons ſuffocated by the fumes of charcoal, advantages have ariſen from rubbing the body with ſnow. But here the heat ſhould be <hi>only diminiſhed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the powers of life;</hi> and, therefore, if the body become cold, equal advantage will accrue from the gradual application of warmth. The ſtate of the veſſels of the brain (29.) would ſeem to require bleeding; and accordingly it has been recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="(l)" place="bottom">PORTAL.</note>.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0002100400:12"/>Blood may therefore be taken from the jugular veins, or from the neck (25). In all other reſpects, the methods of treatment will be the ſame as in thoſe who are drowned.</p>

               <p n="31">31. Children, from inattention or other cauſes, are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmothered in beds. When not overlaid, the functions of life are ſolely ſuſpended by breathing confined air. From experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon brutes, it appears that, in this caſe, the lungs are collapſed, and, except the accumulation of blood in the heart, and large veſſels in the neighbourhood, no injury is done to the reſt of the ſyſtem. If the means of recovery, therefore, be not too long delayed after the lungs and heart have ceaſed to act, there will be great hopes of reſtoring the patient. If the body be too hot, as is commonly the caſe, it ſhould be expoſed, at firſt, to a current of air. The lungs ſhould be immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated; and, afterwards, in every other reſpect, it ſhould be treated conformably to what has been recommended in ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from drowning.</p>
               <p n="32">32. In ſuch ſtill-born children as come into the world, in other reſpects, with a healthy appearance, great hopes may be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from inflating the lungs, if too much time have not been loſt. But this proceſs ought to be continued aſſiduouſly for ſome hours, by blowing air thro' a quill, or any ſmall tube inſerted into the mouth. The temperature of the body ſhould at the ſame time be kept up by a due degree of warmth; and the blood propelled from the ſurface to the heart by proper frictions.</p>

Many ingenious inſtruments have been recommended by authors, and adopted by different eſtabliſhments in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to recover the apparently dead; but the MEDICAL SOCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETY have preferred the improvements lately made upon them by Mr SAVIGNY of London, both on account of the utility of the inſtruments, and their being contained in a caſe, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely portable. Some management, however, is required to adjuſt the <hi>inſtruments</hi> to the different purpoſes; but a careful inſpection of their component parts<note n="(n)" place="bottom">Mr Savigny's original caſe contained an <hi>apparatus</hi> for injecting the fumes of tobacco, which the SOCIETY have not recommended.</note>, and attention to the following directions, will render their application eaſy.</p>
            <p n="39">39. When air from the lungs of a healthy perſon is to be uſed, the <hi>ivory mouth-piece</hi> is to be ſcrewed on one end of the <hi>flexible tube of red leather,</hi> and the <hi>ivory nozle</hi> upon its other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, by which means, a blow-pipe is compleatly formed; which is to be inſerted into the noſtril; and to be managed in the ſame manner as the <hi>wooden pipe</hi> (33.). But as atmoſpheric air<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Dephlogiſticated air, diſcovered by Dr Prieſtly, preſerved in blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, has been recommended by ſeveral authors; but as the expanſion of the lungs ſeems to be the principal object of the inflation, the <hi>Society</hi> think it of little importance whether dephlogiſticated, or atmoſpheric air be uſed; and indeed, thoſe who have recommended the former were never able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any animal with it, when atmoſpheric air had been found ineffectual.</note> ſhould be, in moſt caſes, preferred for inflating the lungs properly, the following adjuſtment of the inſtrument will be required: The conical part of the <hi>hollow ſcrew,</hi> by means of the <hi>braſs winch,</hi> is to be firmly ſcrewed into the muzzle of any common pair of <hi>bellows</hi>
               <note n="(p)" place="bottom">Proper bellows are always in readineſs at the place where the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are lodged.</note>: The <hi>ivory mouth-piece</hi> of the <hi>flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0002100400:15"/>tube,</hi> is then to be removed, and the other end of the <hi>conical ſcrew</hi> to be fitted in its place. The inſtrument being thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, "a proper perſon, ſtationed at the head of the body, is to paſs the tube into the noſtril, and ſuſtaining it there with the fore-finge, he is to compreſs the other noſtril with his thumb, and the mouth with the remainder of the ſame hand, that no air may paſs out. With the other hand, he is to make a ſuitable preſſure upon the prominent part of the windpipe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent air paſſing into the ſtomach. The medical director is then to work the bellows, which ought, at one play, to throw in a ſufficient quantity of air to fill the lungs. When they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly diſtended, the hand ſhould be removed from the mouth, and the lungs are to be aſſiſted in emptying themſelves by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the belly and cheſt. The ſame proceſs is to be repeated for ſome time, that, as far as poſſible, the manner of natural reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration may be imitated." If the air do not paſs into the lungs ſo as to diſtend them compleatly, it probably ariſes from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perture of the windpipe being ſhut, which may generally be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by bringing the tongue forwards.</p>
            <p n="40">40. But if farther impediments occur to the inflation of the lungs, the <hi>ivory nozle</hi> (39) muſt be removed, and the <hi>ſilver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> in the form of a catheter ſcrewed on the <hi>tube of red lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in its place. The inſtrument being thus completed, "the medical director ſhould place himſelf on the right ſide of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; and introducing the fore-finger of his left hand, at the corner of the patient's mouth, he ſhould puſh the point of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the <hi>epiglottis,</hi> and uſing this finger as a directory, he muſt enter the tube, with the other hand, at the left corner of the mouth, till the end of the inſtrument has paſt beyond the point of his fore-finger; and the inſtrument is then to be ſuffered to fall rather than to be puſhed into the <hi>glottis."</hi> The bellows are then to be worked as in the former proceſs (39).</p>
            <p n="41">41. If the methods propoſed (39.40.), fail of inflating the lungs, an opening into the wind-pipe may be made; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought to be tried as a laſt reſource. The ſilver inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be introduced into the opening, fitted with the bellows, and to be worked in the ſame manner as recommended (40.); by which means air will be certainly thrown into the lungs.</p>
            <p n="42">42. The next inſtrument recommended is the <hi>elaſtic tube of black leather,</hi> for conveying medicines into the ſtomach. The ſmall end muſt be carefully introduced down the gullet, into the ſtomach; and any liquid cordial, ſuch as <hi>ſpirits, aether, volatile liquor of hartſhorn,</hi> or <hi>oil of peppermint,</hi> properly diluted with water, muſt be poured in ſmall quantities into the other end of the tube; and if the liquor do not deſcend readily, blowing upon it will make it paſs into the ſtomach.</p>

But if the external parts of the body be ſo chilled, that the ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer ſinks below 32<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, cold applications will be at firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and in this caſe the heat ſhould be afterwards increaſed ſlowly and gradually.—The inſtrument may likewiſe be eaſily introduced into any cavity, ſo as to aſcertain the degree of internal heat; which remains, in general, for ſome hours after the external ſurface is cold.
