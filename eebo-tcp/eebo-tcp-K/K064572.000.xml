            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the <hi>Convocation</hi> had been ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
I would have made this
Dedication to them, and
humbly implored of them,
what, for their Love to the Fathers,
they would readily have granted, a
Recommendation of theſe my <hi>Diſcourſes</hi>
on <hi>Miracles</hi> to the <hi>Clergy</hi>: But being
unhappily diſappointed of a Seſſion of
that <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> Body, for
whoſe wiſe Debates and orthodox Votes
I have ſuch a Veneration, as is not to
be expreſs'd in a few Words, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1207700400:3"/>
turn'd my Thoughts on your
<hi>Lordſhip,</hi> to whom a <hi>Dedication</hi> is due,
becauſe of your Reſpect, often declared,
for the Authority of the Fathers, which
induces me to think, you now approve
of the Uſe I have made of them.</p>
            <p>But what I am here to applaud your
<hi>Lordſhip</hi> for, is, your <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> call'd
<hi>Difficulties and Diſcouragements,</hi> &amp;c.
That admirable Satire againſt modern
Orthodoxy and Perſecution! How was
I tickled in the Peruſal of it! It is
plainly the Senſe of your Soul, or you
had ſet your Name to it: And if the
Temptation of Praiſe for it, had not
been too great to be reſiſted, I could
have wiſh'd you had always conceal'd
your ſelf; and then you had not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
againſt the Grain, an aukward Piece
on <hi>Church Power,</hi> like a Retractation,
to reingratiate your ſelf with ſome Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
<hi>Noodles,</hi> whom you no
more, than I, need to care for.</p>
            <p>I have ſometimes wondered, <hi>My
Lord,</hi> where and when the Great Mr.
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1207700400:4"/>
               <hi>Grounds</hi> imbibed his notable Notions
about Religion and Liberty; for he
ſuck'd them not in with his Mothers
Milk, who, I ſuppoſe, train'd him up
in the Belief of Chriſtianity: But when
I conſider'd, that he was once the <hi>Pupil</hi>
of Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> my wonder
ceas'd. Under your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it ſeems he laid the Foundation
of his diſtinguiſh'd Learning and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions!
His Pupillage will be your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Honour! I wonder, none of the
Writers againſt him have as yet cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
your Praiſe for it! How does he
imitate and reſemble his <hi>Tutor</hi> in Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples!
I can't ſay, he ſurpaſſes you, ſince
there is ſuch a Freedom of Thought and
Expreſſion in your <hi>Difficulties,</hi> &amp;c. ſo
ſtrongly ſavouring of Infid<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>ty, that
he has not as yet equall'd.</p>
            <p>Upon your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Advancement
to a Biſhoprick, <hi>Difficultys and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements</hi>
not withſtanding, I wiſh'd,
without preſcribing to the Wiſdom of
the Government in the choice of a
learned Prelate, that the great Mr.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1207700400:5"/>
               <hi>Grounds,</hi> for the good of the Church
too, might be ſoon conſecrated: And
I ſhould not have deſpair'd of it, but
that he's a Gentleman of real Probity
and Conſcience, and might poſſibly
boggle at Subſcriptions, unleſs you and
Biſhop <hi>Hoadly</hi> could help him to ſome
of your <hi>Reſerves</hi> and <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi>
wherewith you muſt be both well
Stock'd, to overcome that <hi>Difficulty.</hi>
And why ſhould not <hi>Dean Swift</hi> for his
Writings, as well as ſome others, be
made a Biſhop? I ſhould like to ſee
him one; if the <hi>then</hi> Right Reverend
Biſhop <hi>Grounds</hi> would not think him,
for his <hi>Tale of a Tub,</hi> too looſe in
the Faith, for his Company.</p>
            <p>Don't imagine, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that I am
forming of Schemes for my ſelf to be a
Biſhop. Tho theſe my <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> on
<hi>Miracles</hi> are of very great Merit, as
well as your Lordſhip's <hi>Difficulties,</hi> &amp;c.
yet you may be aſſured, I have no ſuch
View, when I tell you, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the Fathers have exalted me to,
of a <hi>Moderator</hi> in this Controverſy,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1207700400:6"/>
ſets me above all Eccleſiaſtical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
excepting the <hi>Arch-Biſhoprick</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which I'm afraid will be
void, before the King is appriſed of
my ſingular Worth and Qualifications
for it.</p>
            <p>But however, if ſuch excellent <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi>
as <hi>Grounds, Hoadly, Swift, Hare</hi>
and <hi>my ſelf</hi> were at the Head of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Affairs, what would we do?
What ſhould we not do? What would
not this free-thinking Age expect from
us? Nothing leſs, than that, according
to our Principles, we ſhould endeavour
to ſet Mankind at perfect Liberty, and
to lay open the dirty Fences of the
Church, call'd Subſcriptions, which
are not only the Stain of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
but the <hi>Diſcouragements,</hi> your
<hi>Lordſhip</hi> hints at, in the Study of the
Scriptures: And if we made a Puſh
for an Act of P<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>t to turn the <hi>Clergy</hi>
to Graſs, after King <hi>Henry</hi> VIIIth's
Monks and Fryars; where would be
the Harm of it? Nay, the Advantage
to the Publick, as well as to Religion,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1207700400:7"/>
would be great, if their Revenues were
apply'd to the Payment of National
Debts; with a Reſerve to our ſelves
(remember, <hi>My Lord</hi>) of large Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
out of them, according to our
great Merits; otherwiſe worldly-wiſe
Men will repute us impolitick Fools,
which you and Biſhop <hi>Hoadly,</hi> I humbly
preſume, will never endure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of.</p>
            <p>So, hoping your Lordſhip will accept
of this Dedication to your Praiſe, in as
much Sincerity as it is written, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

DISCOURSE
ON THE
MIRACLES
OF OUR
<hi>SAVIOUR,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW for a <hi>fourth</hi> Diſcourſe on
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles, which, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I begin with a Repetition
of the three general Heads, at
firſt propoſed to be treated on;
and they are,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſhow, that the Miracles of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all manner of bodily Diſeaſes, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1207700400:9"/>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> was famed for, are none of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Miracles of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>; neither are
they ſo much as a good Proof of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority to found a Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To prove that the literal Hiſtory of
many of the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> does imply Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
Improbabilities and Incredibilities;
conſequently they, either in the whole
or in part, were never wrought, as it is
commonly believed now-a-days, but are
only related as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives, of what would be myſteriouſly,
and more wonderfully done by him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To conſider what <hi>Jeſus</hi> means,
when he appeals to his Miracles, as to a
Teſtimony and Witneſs of his divine
Power; and to ſhow that he could not
properly and ultimately refer to thoſe he
then wrought in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
ones, he would do in the Spirit; of
which thoſe wrought in the Fleſh are but
mere Types and Shadows.</p>
            <p>I am upon the ſecond of theſe Heads,
and according to it, have, in my <hi>former
Diſcourſes,</hi> taken into examination <hi>eight</hi>
of the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus, viz.</hi> thoſe:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1207700400:10"/>
1. Of his driving the Buyers and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
out of the Temple.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of his exorciſing the <hi>Devils</hi> out of
the Mad-men, and ſending them into the
Herd of Swine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of his Transfiguration on the Mount.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of his healing a Woman, that had
an Iſſue of Blood, twelve Years.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of his curing a Woman that had a
Spirit of Infirmity, eighteen Years.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Of his telling the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman,
her fortune of having had five Husbands,
and being then an Adultereſs with another
Man.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Of his curſing the Fig-tree for not
bearing Fruit out of ſeaſon. And,</p>
            <p n="8">8. Of his healing a Man of an Infirmity
at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether it be not manifeſt, that the
Literal and Evangelical Story of theſe
Miracles, from what I have argu'd and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
upon them, does not conſiſt of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
Improbabilities, and Incredibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
according to the Propoſition before
us, let my Readers judge; and ſo I come to
the Conſideration of</p>
            <p n="9">9. A ninth Miracle of <hi>Jeſus, viz.</hi> that
 <note n="1" place="bottom">John ix.</note> of his giving ſight to a Man who was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1207700400:11"/>
born blind, by the means of Eye-ſalve,
made of Dirt and Spittle.</p>
            <p>Blindneſs, as far as one may gueſs by
the Evangelical Hiſtory, was the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
that <hi>Jeſus</hi> frequently exercis'd his
Power on: And there is no doubt to be
made, but he heal'd many of one Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Defect and Imperfection, or other in
their Eyes; but whether he wrought any
Miracle upon any, he is ſuppoſed to have
cured, is uncertain. There are, as it's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
many kinds of Blindneſs, that are
incurable by Art or Nature; and there are
other kinds of it, that Nature and Art
will relieve a Man in. But whether <hi>Jeſus</hi>
uſed his healing Power againſt the former,
as well as the latter ſort of Blindneſs, is
more than can be affirm'd, or at leaſt proved
by our <hi>Divines.</hi> And unleſs we knew of
a certainty, that the ſore or blind Eyes,
<hi>Jeſus</hi> cured, were abſolutely out of the
reach of Art and Nature; <hi>Infidels</hi> will
imagine, and ſuggeſt, that he was only
Maſter of a good Ointment for ſore Eyes,
and being ſucceſsful in the uſe of it, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
People would needs think, he wrought
Miracles.</p>
            <p>The World is often bleſs'd with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Oculiſts,</hi> who thro' Study and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
have attain'd to wonderful Skill in
Eye-Maladies, which, tho they are of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1207700400:12"/>
ſorts, yet, by Cuſtom of Speech,
all paſs under the general Name of <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
And ſometimes we hear of famous
<hi>Chance-Doctors,</hi> like <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who by a Gift
of God, Nature, or Fortune, without any
Skill in the Structure of the Eyes, have
been very ſucceſsful in the Cure of one
Diſtemper or other incident to them: Such
was Sir <hi>William Read,</hi> who, tho no Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
nor of acquir'd Abilities in <hi>Phyſick</hi> and
<hi>Surgery,</hi> yet cured his Thouſands of ſore
or blind Eyes; and many of them too to
the ſurpriſe and aſtoniſhment of profeſs'd
<hi>Surgeons</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> Whether He, or
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> cured the greater number of Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
may be queſtion'd. To pleaſe our
<hi>Divines,</hi> it ſhall be granted that <hi>Jeſus</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the greater Numbers; but that he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
worſe or more difficult Diſtempers in
the Eyes, can't be proved. Sir <hi>William</hi>
indeed met with many Caſes of blind and
ſore Eyes, that were out of the reach of
his Power; and ſo did <hi>Jeſus</hi> too, or he had
never let great Multitudes of the blind, and
otherwiſe diſtemper'd People, go unheal'd
by him. Our <hi>Divines</hi> will here ſay, that
it was never want of Power in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but
want of Faith in the diſeaſed, if he did
not heal them; but in other <hi>Surgeons</hi> and
<hi>Phyſicians,</hi> it is confeſſedly their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency:
To which I have only this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1207700400:13"/>
Anſwer, that our <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Surgeons</hi>
are to be commended for their Ingenuity,
to impute it to their own Defect of Power,
and not to lay the Blame upon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
when they can't cure them: And
it is lucky for us Chriſtians, that we have
<hi>this Salvo</hi> for the Credit of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
healing Power, that it was not
fit, he ſhould exert it againſt Unbelief;
otherwiſe, reaſonably ſpeaking, He, with
Sir <hi>William Read, Greatrex, Veſpaſian,</hi>
our former <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Seventh-Sons,</hi>
muſt have paſs'd but for a <hi>Chance-Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come to the particular Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Miracle before us. <hi>Jeſus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
it ſeems, a blind Man to his Eye-ſight,
by the uſe of a peculiar Ointment,
and waſhing of his Eyes, as directed, in
the Pool of <hi>Siloam.</hi> Where lies the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle?
I can't ſee it; but hope our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
will take their opportunity to point
it out to me. Our <hi>Surgeons</hi> with their
Ointments and Waſhings can cure ſore
and blind Eyes of one ſort or other; and
<hi>Jeſus</hi> did no more here; and yet he muſt
be reckon'd a Worker of Miracles; and they,
but artificial Operators: where's the Senſe
and Reaſon of this difference between
them? If Mr. <hi>Moor,</hi> the <hi>Apothecary,</hi> for
the notable Cures he performs, by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1207700400:14"/>
means of his Medicines, ſhould write him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and be accounted by his Admirers, a
<hi>Miracle-worker</hi>; he and they would be
but laugh'd at for it: And yet <hi>Jeſus</hi> for
his curing the ſore Eyes of a poor Man
with an Ointment, muſt be had in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
for a divine and miraculous Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,
as much as if by the breath of his
Mouth, he had removed an huge Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain!</p>
            <p>A Miracle, if I miſtake not the Notion
of our <hi>Divines</hi> about it, is a ſupernatural
Event, or a Work out of the Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Art to effect. And when it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Cure of a Diſeaſe, as of Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Lameneſs, it ought to be ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
as that skilful and experienced <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi>
and <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> who can do ſtrange
and ſurprizing Cures by Art, may give it
upon their Judgment, that no Skill of
Man could reach that Operation; but that
it ought to paſs for the Work of a divine
and almighty Hand and Power: But
there is no ſuch care taken in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of any of the Diſeaſes, which
<hi>Jeſus</hi> cured; much leſs of this before us;
againſt the miraculouſneſs of which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
there are theſe two Exceptions
to be made:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we know nothing of the
Nature of this poor Man's Blindneſs; nor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1207700400:15"/>
what was the defect of his Eyes; nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was curable by Art or not: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which Knowledge, it is impoſſible and
unreaſonable to aſſert, that there was a
Miracle wrought in the Cure of him. If
his blindneſs or weakneſs of Eye-ſight
was curable by human means, and Jeſus
did uſe thoſe means, there's an end of the
Miracle. If the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> had given us
an accurate Deſcription of the Condition
of this Man's Eyes before Cure, we could
have judg'd better: But this is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
neglect in all the Diſtempers <hi>Jeſus</hi>
heal'd, and is enough to induce us to doubt
of his miraculous Power. There are, as I
have ſaid, ſome ſorts of ſore or blind Eyes
curable by Art, as Experience does teſtify;
and there are others incurable, as <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
and <hi>Patients</hi> do lament. Of which
ſort this Man's was, we know not. The
worſt that we know of his Caſe, is, that
he was blind from his Birth, or Infancy,
which might be; and yet Time, Nature
and Art, may give relief to him. As a
Man advances in Years, the diſeaſes of
Childhood and Youth wear off. What we
call the <hi>King's-Evil,</hi> or an Inflamation in
the Eyes, in time will abate of its Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Nature will not only by degrees
work the Cure it-ſelf, but the ſeaſonable
help of a good <hi>Oculiſt</hi> will ſoon expedite
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1207700400:16"/>
it, tho in time of Infancy he could be of
no uſe. And who knows but this might
be the Caſe of this blind Man, whoſe
Cure <hi>Jeſus</hi> by his Art did only haſten
and help forward. However, there are
Grounds enough to ſuſpect, that it was
not divine Power which heal'd this Man,
or <hi>Jeſus</hi> had never prepared and order'd
an <hi>Ointment</hi> and <hi>Waſh</hi> for him.</p>
            <p>Should our <hi>Divines</hi> ſuppoſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
for the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> a ſtate of
Blindneſs in this Man, incurable by Art;
that would be begging the Queſtion,
which no Unbeliever will grant. But
to pleaſe them, I will yield, without
Enquiry into the Nature of this Man's
Blindneſs, that, if <hi>Jeſus</hi> had uſed no
Medicines; if with only a word of his
Mouth he had cured the Man, and he
had inſtantaneouſly recover'd, as the Word
was ſpoken; here would have been a
real and great Miracle, let the Blindneſs
or Imperfection of the Man's Sight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be of what kind or degree ſoever.
But <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s uſe of Waſhings and Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
abſolutely ſpoils and deſtroys the
Credit of the Miracle, and we ought
by no means to aſcribe <hi>that</hi> to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Hand and Power of God, which
<hi>Medicines</hi> and <hi>Balſams</hi> are apply'd to the
Effect of. And this brings me to the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1207700400:17"/>
               <hi>Second</hi> Exception againſt the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs
of the Cure of this blind Man,
which is, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> uſed human means
for the Cure of him; which means,
whether they were at all proper and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
in themſelves, do affect the Credit
of the Miracle, and give occaſion of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,
that it was Art and not divine
Power that heal'd him, or <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for
his Honour, had never had recourſe to
the uſe of them. And what were thoſe
Means, or that Medicine, which <hi>Jeſus</hi>
made uſe of? Why, "He ſpit upon the
Ground, and made a Balſam of Dirt
and Spittle, and anointed the poor
Man's Eyes with it, and he recover'd."
A ſtrange and odd ſort of an Ointment,
that I believe was never uſed before, nor
ſince, for ſore and blind Eyes! I am
not Student enough in <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi>
to account for the natural and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
uſe of this Balſam; but wiſh that
skilful Profeſſors of thoſe Sciences would
help me out at this difficulty. If they
could rationally account for the uſe of
this Eye-ſalve, tho it was by ſuppoſing,
that Jeſus imperceptibly had in his Mouth
a proper unctuous and balſamick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which he diſſolv'd into Spittle,
they would do great ſervice to a certain
Cauſe; and I wonder none of them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1207700400:18"/>
whether well or ill affected to Religion,
have as yet bent their Thoughts to it.</p>
            <p>In the Practice of <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Surgery,</hi>
there are ſometimes very odd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Medicaments made uſe of;
and now-and-then very whimſical and
ſeemingly ridiculous ones, by old Women,
to good Purpoſe: But none of them are
to be compared to <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Balſam for
ſore Eyes. I have heard of a merry
<hi>Mountebank</hi> of Diſtinction, whoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Medicine was <hi>Haſty-Pudding,</hi>
which indeed is a notable Remedy againſt
the <hi>Eſuriency</hi> of the Stomach, that the
Poor often labour under. But <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Eye-Salve, for abſurdity, whim, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity,
was never equall'd, either in
jeſt or in earneſt, by any <hi>Quack-Doctor.</hi>
Whether <hi>Infidels</hi> think of this Ointment
of the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> with a ſmile; or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on it with diſdain, I can't gueſs.
As to myſelf, I ſhould think with St.
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> 
               <note n="2" place="bottom">Quid Lutum illinere oportet? hoc potius caecum reddere, quis unquam hoc pacto curatus eſt? <hi>In Loc. Johan.</hi>
               </note> , that this Eye-Salve of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
would ſooner put a Man's Eyes out,
than reſtore a blind one to his Sight. And
I believe that our <hi>Divines,</hi> for the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of the Miracle, and our <hi>Surgeons,</hi>
for the Honour of their Science, will
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1207700400:19"/>
agree, that it could not be naturally ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
and effective of the Cure of the
blind Man.</p>
            <p>What then was the Reaſon of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
uſing this ſtrange Eye-Salve, when, for
the ſake of the Miracle, and for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his own Power, he ſhould have
cured the Man with a word ſpeaking?
This is a Queſtion and Objection in St.
<hi>Cyril</hi> 
               <note n="3" place="bottom">Quam ob cauſam dicet aliquis, cum omnia ſolo Verbo praeſtare poſſit, nulloque negotio, Lutum quidem ſputo macerat? <hi>In Loc. Johan.</hi>

who are obliged to give an Anſwer to it,
that will conſiſt with the Wiſdom and
Power of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> otherwiſe they muſt
give up the Miracle, or make him a
vain inſignificant and trifling Agent. St.
<hi>Cyril,</hi> of whoſe mind I am, ſays <note n="4" place="bottom">Sed Rationem quandam myſticam habet Vis Rei iſtius de ſputo. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> that
the Reaſon of the uſe of this Balſam
made of Dirt and Spittle is to be fetch'd
from the Myſtery. But, in as much as
our <hi>Divines</hi> will never agree to that,
which would be of ill Conſequence to
their Miniſtry, they muſt give a good
Reaſon of their own, which I deſpair of
ſeeing, that will comport with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1207700400:20"/>
St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> too, ſays <note n="5" place="bottom">Ei autem qui caecus fuerat a Nativitate, jam non per ſermonem ſed per operationem praeſtitit viſum; non vanè, neque prout evenit, hoc faciens, ſed ut oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eret manum Dei, eam quae ab initio plaſmavit Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Contra Haereſ. L. v. c. 15.</note> , that the <hi>Clay
and Spittle</hi> was of no ſervice to the Cure
of the blind Man; and yet <hi>Jeſus</hi> did
not uſe it <hi>in vain.</hi> Is not this an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency?
How will our <hi>Divines</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
it? With <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> I am ſure they'll
not myſtically ſolve the Difficulty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if they don't provide another So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lntion
of it to ſatisfaction, either their
Miniſtry of the Letter, or the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and this Miracle, muſt
ſuffer for it.</p>
            <p>I am puzzled to think, how our
<hi>Divines</hi> will extricate themſelves out of
this Strait, and account for the uſe of
this Eye-Slave, without any Diminution
of the Miracle. Surely, they will not
ſay that <hi>Jeſus</hi> uſed this ſenſleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant
Ointment to put a <hi>Slur</hi> upon
the Practice of <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Surgery,</hi> as if
other Medicines were of no more avail
than his <hi>Dirt</hi> and <hi>Spittle.</hi> They have
more wit than to ſay ſo; leaſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
a noble and moſt uſeful Profeſſion,
not ſo much againſt themſelves, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> and provoke them to a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1207700400:21"/>
nicer and ſtricter Enquiry than I can
make into his Miracles, the Diſeaſes he
cured, and his manner of Operation;
and to infer from thence, that he
could be no miraculous Healer of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
who uſed Medicines; nor his <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi>
orthodox at Theology, who were
ſo inexpert at Anatomy and the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of bodily Diſtempers. This might
be of bad Conſequence to Religion: And
yet I wonder that none of them, who
may be ſuppoſed a little diſaffected to
Chriſtianity, have taken the Hint from
this pretended Miracle before us, and ſome
others, to endeavour at a Proof of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
being little better than a <hi>Quack-Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I was, what I am not, an <hi>Infidel,</hi>
I ſhould think, from the Letter of this
Story, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a <hi>juggling Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
who would paſs for a miraculous
Healer of Diſeaſes, tho he uſed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
proper Medicines. The <hi>Clay and
the Spittle</hi> he made an open ſhew of, as
what, to Admiration, he would cure the
blind Man with; but in reſerve he had
a more ſanative Balſam, that he ſubtilly
ſlip't in the room of the Clay, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly
to good purpoſe anointed the
Man's Eyes with it. But as the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Fathers, and their myſtical
Interpretation of this Story, is alone my
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1207700400:22"/>
ſafe-guard againſt ſuch an ill opinion of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>; ſo I would now gladly know
upon what Bottom the Faith of our
<hi>Divines</hi> can ſtand, as to this Miracle, and
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s divine Power in it.</p>
            <p>I have peruſed ſome of our <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators</hi>
on the Place, and don't perceive
that they heſitate at this ſtrange Eye-Salve;
nor make any Queſtions about
the pertinent or impertinent Uſe of it.
Whether it is, that they ſleep over the
Story, or are aware of greater Difficultys
in it, than can be eaſily ſurmounted, and
therefore dare not touch on't, I know
not. But now that we enjoy Liberty
of Debate, which will make us Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
and I have taken the Freedom
to make a ſtricter Scrutiny than ordinary
into <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles, and to conſider what
abſurditys, their Storys, and <hi>this</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
are clog'd with; it is incumbent
on our <hi>Divines</hi> to anſwer ſolidly theſe
Queſtions, <hi>viz.</hi> What was the Reaſon
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Uſe of this Eye-Salve made
of Clay and Spittle? Whether, if it was
of ſervice to the Cure of the blind Man,
it does not deſtroy the Miracle? And if
it had no Effect in the Cure of him,
whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not a <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>trifling</hi>
Operator, making uſe of inſignificant and
impertinent Medicines to the Diminution
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1207700400:23"/>
of his divine Power? Theſe Queſtions
are not ludicrous, but <hi>calm and ſedate
Reaſoning,</hi> which <hi>Biſhop Smalbroke</hi> 
               <note n="6" place="bottom">See his Sermon before the Societys for Reformation, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> 
does not diſapprove of. Therefore a grave,
rational, and ſubſtantial Anſwer is expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, ſuch as will be a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Wiſdom and Power of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> without any Diminution of the
Miracle.</p>
            <p>Should our <hi>Divines</hi> ſay, that this
Matter was an Act of unſearchable
Wiſdom, and muſt be left to the Will
of our Saviour, and not curiouſly pry'd
into, any more than ſome other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations
of Providence, that are paſt
finding out: This Anſwer, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be the beſt, that can be given,
will not do here. The Miracles of
<hi>Jeſus</hi> are, as our <hi>Divines</hi> own, Appeals
to our Reaſon and Senſes for his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and by our Reaſon and Senſes they
are to be try'd, condemn'd or approved
of. If they will not abide the teſt of
Reaſon and Senſe, they are to be rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Authority along with
them. Therefore a more cloſe, pertinent
and ſerious Anſwer is to be given to the
ſaid Queſtions; which as I believe to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1207700400:24"/>
be impoſſible, conſiſtently with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
ſo our <hi>Divines</hi> muſt of neceſſity go
along with me to the Fathers for a myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
and allegorical Interpretation of the
Story of this Eye-Salve; or the Miracle
will fall to the Ground, and <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
divine Power be in great danger with
it.</p>

not enter into the Diſpute, which as it
is of no Conſequence to my Cauſe in

urge any Arguments for or againſt either
ſide of it.</p>
            <p>Tho I would not for the World be
ſo impious and profane as to believe,
what is contain'd and imply'd in the
Letter of this Story; yet I am ſtill too
grave to handle it as ludicrouſly as I
ought; and it is now againſt the grain,
that I write ſo freely as I ſhall againſt
it, being unwilling, not only to put the
<hi>Clergy</hi> out of all Temper, but, to give
<hi>Scoffers</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> ſo great an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
againſt their Miniſtry of the Letter.
Some may wonder that I, who have
gone ſo far in the ludicrous diſplay of
the groſs Abſurdities of ſome other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
ſhould boggle at this. But to be
ingenuous, and ſpeak the Truth ſincerely,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1207700400:31"/>

            <p>There were ſome antiently, whom St.

               <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Hereticks,</hi> I know not, who
took great offence at the Story of this
Wedding, accounting it, from what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in St. <hi>John,</hi> as a riotous Feaſt,
and that <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Mother, and his
Diſciples, not only bore a part in the
Revellings, but were moſt to blame for
them; or he ſhould not have countenanced
them with his Preſence, much leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
them, by the Change of a large
quantity of Water into Wine for the uſe
of a Company, who were already <hi>drunk</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1207700400:32"/>
with it. But I, with St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> am
inclined to believe, that, if <hi>Jeſus</hi> did
grace this Wedding with his Preſence,
there was no Exceſs encouraged, or ſo
much as ſuffer'd at it. If he did accept
of the Invitation of the Bridegroom, it
was for an opportunity, not ſo much to
turn <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine,</hi> as to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Diſcourſe to the People of conjugal
Duties; and, as he was a ſearcher of the
Hearts, ſecretly to admoniſh the Married
of the Sin and Miſchief of Adultery;
tho we read not of a ſeaſonable and
good Word ſpoken at it.</p>
            <p>And the Empreſs <hi>Eudocia,</hi> a nurſing
Mother of the Church, has given us a
Poetical, and I hope a fictitious Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Wedding. She makes a
ſumptuous and voluptuous Feaſt of it;
and writes <note n="30" place="bottom">Pueri aut Saltatores volutabantur, in his autem Tibiae, Lyraeque Vocem habebant.

Conceptions of a Country Wedding;
or whether ſhe had any extra-ſcriptural
Authority for what ſhe writ, I know
not: But I believe, that, if <hi>Jeſus</hi> was at
all at a Marriage-Feaſt, the whole was
conducted with Decency, Order, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety;
and if he there wrought any
Miracle, it was to manifeſt his Glory,
to the Converſion of ſome, and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Faith of others.</p>
            <p>And our <hi>Tranſlators</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> too
have given occaſion to ſuſpect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of Exceſs at this Wedding; or
they need not have made the Waterpots
to hold two or three Firkins apiece. If
I had been the Tranſlator, they ſhould
not have held above two or three <hi>Pints</hi>
apiece, which Meaſure is as agreeable to
the Original as <hi>Firkin</hi>; neither can I
imagine, that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if he did convert
Water into Wine, would do it in ſo
large a Meaſure, for fear of an intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
abuſe of it, but only gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
a caſt of his miraculous Power,
and a little taſte of his Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
to them.</p>
            <p>Such are the Conceptions, that, to the
Honour of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I am willing to form
of this <hi>Wedding</hi>; and wiſh that the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1207700400:34"/>
Letter of the Story did ſuggeſt no worſe
Thoughts of it to us. I ſhould be pleas'd,
if no <hi>Infidel</hi> really could, what I, but
for the ſake of the Myſtery moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
ſhould, write any ludicrous
Deſcants on it. But if this Story had
been related of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> as
it is of our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I would have ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd
and ſatiriz'd it to the utmoſt of
my Power, and have render'd him and
his Diſciples of all Nations, as contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
as I could, for the Belief of it;
and I don't doubt, but our Chriſtian
<hi>Prieſts</hi> would have given me ample Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Commendations for ſo doing. It
is ſaid of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of his Friends, he commanded
variety of nice Diſhes of Meat, together
with Bowls of choiceſt Wine, all on a
ſudden to deſcend upon his Table and
range themſelves in good Order. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was any Truth in this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

in it, (tho none in <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Wine at this
Wedding) as if it was done for the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

               <hi>Divines</hi> I ſuppoſe, no more than myſelf,

<hi>Apollonius</hi>; but, if it was really wrought,
I fancy, I could have lampoon'd him for
it, and would have made it a diabolical
Work, like that, as Fables go, of the
Feaſtings of <hi>Wizards</hi> and <hi>Witches</hi>; and
our <hi>Divines</hi> (paſſing by <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s <hi>Wine</hi>

ſtruck in with me.</p>
            <p>But ſetting aſide that miraculous Story
of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> which has but <hi>one</hi> Voucher;
the Caſe before us is <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s <hi>turning Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Veneration for the Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
which Converſation with the Fathers,
more than the Prejudice of Education
has begotten in me, and ludicrouſly here
treat him and his Miracle too, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon me, to make way for the
Myſtery? In ſhort, I can't do it, in my

Invective of a ſuppoſed Jewiſh <hi>Rabbi</hi>
to this purpoſe, I here publiſh it, that
our <hi>Clergy,</hi> as well as myſelf, may

that Miſchief it may do by being
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1207700400:36"/>
handed about among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi>
in Manuſcript. It is as follows;</p>

               <body>
                  <p>You Chriſtians pay Adoration to

Author of Religion, ſent of God
for the Inſtruction, Reformation and
Salvation of Mankind; and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
you to this Belief of him, is,
(beſides ſome obſcure Prophecies, which
you can't agree upon, and which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your ſelves, nor any body elſe
underſtands the Application of) the
Hiſtory of his Miracles: But I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
you ſhould have a good opinion
of him for his Miracles, which, if he
wrought no better than what are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of him, by your <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi>
are, if duly conſider'd, enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate
your Hearts from him. I can't
ſpare time now to examine into all of
them, but according to the curſory
Obſervation I have made on them, there
is not one ſo well circumſtanced, as to
merit a conſiderate Man's belief, that
it was the Work of an omnipotent,
all-wiſe, juſt and good Agent. Some
of them are abſurd Tales, others foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Facts, others unjuſt Actions, others
ludicrous Pranks, others jugling Tricks,
others magical Enchantments; and if
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1207700400:37"/>
many of them had been better and
greater Operations than they are, and
of a more uſeful and ſtupendous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than they ſeem to be; yet the
firſt Miracle that he wrought, <hi>viz.</hi>
that of his <hi>turning Water into Wine</hi>
at an extravagant and voluptuous Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> is enough to
turn our Stomachs againſt all the reſt.
It is in itſelf enough to beget in us
an ill opinion of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to prepoſſeſs
us with an averſion to his Religion,
without farther Examination into it.
It is enough to make us ſuſpect his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miracles, of what name ſoever,
to be of a baſe, magical, and diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Extraction; or he had never ſet
up for a divine worker of Miracles
with ſo ill a grace. Would any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
grave, ſerious and divine Perſon,
as you Chriſtians ſuppoſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> to have
been, have vouchſaf'd his Preſence at
a Wedding, where ſuch Levities, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
and Exceſſes (in our Nation of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as in all others)
were indulg'd on ſuch Occaſions, as
were not fit to be ſeen, much leſs
countenanc'd by the <hi>Saint,</hi> you would
make of him. If your <hi>Jeſus,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his Diſciples had not been
merry Folks in themſelves, they would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1207700400:38"/>
have declined the Invitation of the
<hi>Bridegroom</hi>; nay, if they had been at
all graver and more ſerious People
than ordinary, no Invitation had been
given to ſuch <hi>Spoil-Sports</hi>: But boon
Companions they were, and of comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Converſation, or there had been
at a Wedding no room for them. You
Chriſtians may fancy, what you pleaſe,
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Mother's Saintſhip;
but the very Text of the Story im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
they were Lovers of good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
and Exceſs too, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
or he had never, upon her Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
turn'd ſo large a quantity of
Water into Wine, after all or moſt of
the Company were far gone with it.
You may ſuppoſe, if you pleaſe, that
all were ſober, and none intoxicated,
and that the want of Wine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the abundance of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
rather than exceſs in drinking;
but why then did <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi>

old Stories are true of her familiarity
with a <hi>Soldier,</hi> of whom came her
<hi>chara Deûm Soboles,</hi> in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſhe would take a <hi>Dram</hi> and a <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>

was a little <hi>in</hi> for't, or he had
never ſpoke ſo waſpiſhly and ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly
to his Mother, ſaying, <hi>Woman,</hi>
                     <hi>what have I to do with thee? mine
Hour is not yet come:</hi> which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

You modern Chriſtians may put what

his Credit; but the Fathers of your

of his Temper, derived, <hi>ex traduce,</hi>

a <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>witleſs</hi> Sentence, ſuch as
<hi>Fuddlecaps</hi> utter by halves, when the

modern <hi>Commentators</hi> are ſadly puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled
to make good Senſe of this bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and abrupt Sentence of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and
a pertinent Reply of it, to what his
Mother ſaid to him, <hi>they have no
Wine:</hi> If you will bear with me, I'll
help you out at this dead lift, and
give you the true meaning of it <hi>thus.
Jeſus</hi>'s Mother being appriſed of a
deficiency of Wine, and willing, as well
as the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> that the Company
ſhould be thorowly merry before they
parted, intimates to her Son, (whom
ſhe knew to be initiated in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterys
of <hi>Bacchus</hi>) <hi>that they had no
Wine:</hi> But before ſhe could finiſh her
Requeſt to him, He, miſtaking her
meaning, imagines, ſhe was caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt drinking more Wine, and
exhorting him to go home, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he takes her up ſhort and quick,
ſaying, <hi>Woman, what have you to do
with me?</hi> (for that too is the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
of the <hi>Greek</hi>) I'll not be interrupted
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1207700400:41"/>
in my Cups, nor break Company
<hi>for mine Hour is not yet come</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part:
But after he rightly apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, he goes to work, and rather
than the Company ſhould want their
fill, by trick of Art, like a <hi>Punch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,</hi>
meliorates Water into what they
call'd Wine. That this is the obvious
Interpretation, and natural Paraphraſe
of the Words before us, ſhall be try'd
by the abſurd Comments now-a-days
put upon them, that are enough to
make a conſiderate Man laugh, if not
hiſs at them.</p>
                  <p>Some antient Hereticks <note n="34" place="bottom">Vide Sanctum Auguſtinum. <hi>In Loc. Johan.</hi>
                     </note> , very
gravely infer'd from this Expreſſion,
<hi>Woman, what have I to do with thee,</hi>
that <hi>Mary</hi> was neither a Virgin, nor
<hi>Jeſus</hi> her Son; or he had never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted
her with ſuch blunt Language,
that implys, they could not be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin
to each other. This was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
to St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and gave him
ſome trouble to explain the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
conſiſtently with her Virginity
(for all ſhe cohabited with the old Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter)
and his Filiation. But this
being a quibble, that has been long
ſince dropt, I ſhall not revive, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1207700400:42"/>
on it. But that the Expreſſion
above do's ſuppoſe a little Inebriation
in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I may averr, neither is
there a better Solution to be made of
it.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers of your Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſible of the abſurdity, abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
impertinence, pertneſs, and ſenſleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Paſſage before us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Letter, had recourſe to
a myſtical and allegorical Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the only way to make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the Wiſdom, Sobriety and
Duty of the Holy <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But you
<hi>Moderns,</hi> abandoning Allegories and
Myſteries in Miracles, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd,
I ſay, to put other Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon it, as may comport with
the Letter and Credit of Jeſus: But
how inſipid and ſenſleſs they are,
I appeal to a reaſonable Man, who
will give himſelf the trouble to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
them, upon the Place, and ſave
me the pains of a tedious and nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous
Work to recount them for him.</p>
                  <p>But to humour the Chriſtian Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
at this Day, I will ſuppoſe that
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> and his Mother, and Diſciples,
tho Fiſhermen, to have been all ſober,
grave, and ſerious at this Wedding,
ſuitably to the Opinion that their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1207700400:43"/>
now would have us to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of them. But then it is hard
to conceive them, leſs than Spectators
and even Encouragers of Exceſs and
Intemperance in others; or <hi>Jeſus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their more than ſufficient drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the ſatisfaction of Nature,
had never turn'd Water into Wine,
nor would his Mother have requeſted
him to do it, if, I ſay, they had not
a mind, and took Pleaſure in it too, to
ſee the Company quite <hi>ſtitch'd up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſober, prudent and wiſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
or <hi>Magician,</hi> in the place of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> if he had an Art or Power to
turn Water into Wine, would never
have exercis'd it upon ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
no, not to pleaſe his beſt Friends,
nor in obedience to the moſt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Parent. What would he have
ſaid in ſuch a Caſe? That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
had drank ſufficiently already,
and there was no need of more Wine:
The Bridegroom had kindly and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
entertain'd his Gueſts, and he
would not for the Honour of God,
who had endow'd him with a divine
Power, be at the Expence of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
to promote the leaſt Intemperance.
Whether ſuch a Speech and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> upon this occaſion,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1207700400:44"/>
would not have been more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
than what he did, let any one
judge.</p>
                  <p>If I was a Chriſtian, I would, for
the Honour of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> renounce this
Miracle, and not magnify and extol
it as a divine and good Act, as many
now-a-days do. I would give into,
and contend for the Truth of <hi>that
Gloſs,</hi> which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of old <note n="35" place="bottom">Apud St. Chryſoſtomum <hi>in Loc. Johan.</hi>
                     </note> 
by way of Objection put upon it,
<hi>viz. That the Company having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
the Bridegroom's Stock of Wine,
and being in Expectation of more</hi>;
Jeſus, <hi>rather than the Bridegroom ſhould
be put to the Bluſh for deficiency,
palm'd a falſe Miracle, by the help
of the Governour of the Feaſt, upon
a drunken Crew</hi>; <hi>that is, having ſome
ſpirituous Liquors at hand, mingled
them with a quantity of Water, which
the Governour of the Feaſt vouch'd
to be incomparable good Wine, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
made by</hi> Jeſus: <hi>and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being, thro' a vitiated Palate,
uncapable of diſtinguiſhing better from
worſe, and of diſcovering the Fraud,
admired the Wine and the Miracle</hi>;
<hi>and applauded</hi> Jeſus <hi>for it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1207700400:45"/>
                     <hi>became his Diſciples upon it.</hi> If
I, I ſay, was a Diſciple of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I
would give this Story ſuch an old
turn for his Credit. And I appeal
to indifferent Judges, whether ſuch a
daubing of the Miracle, to remove the
Offence of <hi>Infidels</hi> at this Day, would
not be politically and wiſely done of
me. Whether modern Chriſtians may
be brought into ſuch a Notion of
this ſuppoſed Miracle, I know not;
but really there is room enough to
ſuſpect ſuch a Fraud in it.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Change of
Water into Wine to have been a real
Miracle; none commiſſion'd of God
for the Reformation and Inſtruction
of Mankind would ever have done it
here. Miracles (as Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> 
                     <note n="36" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Vindication of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> p. 82.</note> 
ſays excellently well) <hi>muſt be ſuch
things, as that it is conſiſtent with
the Perfections of God,</hi> to intereſt
himſelf in; and again, <hi>they muſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
not only the Power of God, but
his Love to Mankind, and his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to do them good</hi>; which this of
<hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſo far from, that it has an
an evil Aſpect and Tendency, as is
above repreſented; conſequently it is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1207700400:46"/>
to be rejected, and no longer eſteem'd
a divine Miracle; neither is <hi>Jeſus</hi> to
be received as a Revealer of God's
Will for it, as Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> will
bear me witneſs.</p>
                  <p>No doubt on't, but you Chriſtian
Prieſts would have us <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi>
to believe the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
at this Wedding, for all what
is intimated by St. <hi>John</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to conſiſt of ſober and demure
Saints. I will ſuppoſe ſo; but then,
what occaſion had they at all for
Wine? What reaſon could there be
for God's Power to interpoſe and make
it, eſpecially in ſo large a quantity,
for them? I can conceive none. If
any of the Company had been taken
with fainting Fits; and <hi>Jeſus</hi> for
want of a Cordial Bottle, had created
a chearing Dram or two, I could not
have found fault with it; tho even
here, if he had reſtored the <hi>Patient</hi>
with a word of his Mouth, it had
been a better Miracle, than making
of Wine for him: But that he ſhould
make for a Company of Sots, a large
quantity of Wine, of no leſs than
twelve or eighteen Firkins of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Meaſure, enough to intoxicate the
whole Town of <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1207700400:47"/>
what can never be accounted for by
a Chriſtian, who ſhould, one would
think, wiſh this Story, for the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> expunged out of the
New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if <hi>Jeſus</hi> had really and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
made Wine, which no Power
or Art of Man could do, he ſhould,
to prevent all ſuſpicion of deceit in
the Miracle, have done it without
the uſe of Water. You Chriſtians ſay,
he is the original Cauſe of all Things
out of Nothing; why then did he
not <note n="37" place="bottom">Sed quanam gratia, antequam implerentur, non fecit Miraculum, quod longè fuiſſet admirabilius? Siqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem aliud eſt ſubjectae Materiae qualitatem mutare, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud ipſam ſubſtantiam ex nihilo facere. <hi>Chryſoſ. in Loc.</hi>
                     </note> create this Wine out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
why did he not order the
Pots to be emptied of their Water,
if there was any in them, and then
with a word of his Mouth command
the filling them with Wine inſtead of
it? Here had been an unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Miracle, which no <hi>Infidels</hi> could
have cavil'd at, for any thing, but the
<hi>needleſſneſs</hi> of it. But this ſubject
Matter of Water ſpoils the Credit of
the Miracle. The Water-Pots, it ſeems,
are to be fill'd, before <hi>Jeſus</hi> could do
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1207700400:48"/>
the notable Feat; is not this enough
to make us think, that Jeſus was but
an artificial <hi>Punch-maker?</hi> Could not
he create Wine without Water for a
Tranſmutation? Yes, you'll ſay he
could: what was the Reaſon then, that
he did not? This is a reaſonable Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a learned Prieſthood; and a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Anſwer ſhould be given to
it. And a Queſtion too it is that
heretofore has been under debate.
Some ſaid that the Water might be
uſed to abate of the <note n="38" place="bottom">Saepe obeſt Magnitudo, ne Miracula creditu ſint facilia. <hi>Theophylaect. in Loc.</hi>
                     </note> immenſity
of the Miracle, which otherwiſe for
its greatneſs might have ſurpaſs'd all
belief. But this Reaſon will not do.
A Miracle can't be too great in itſelf,
if well atteſted, to tranſcend Credit:
but it may eaſily be too little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate
the Faith of a Free-Thinker.
The Fathers of your Church fetch'd a
Reaſon, for the uſe of Water here,
from the Myſtery; but ſince Myſterys
on Miracles are ſet aſide by the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of this Age, they are to aſſign
another and good Reaſon of their own;
or this Miracle is to be rejected, as a
piece of Art and Craft in the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1207700400:49"/>
if for no other Reaſon than this,
that <hi>Jeſus</hi> uſed Water to make Wine.</p>
                  <p>All that I have to ſay more to this
Miracle, is, that it is to be wiſh'd, if
Jeſus could turn Water into Wine, that
he had imparted the Secret and Power
to his Diſciples of the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of
all Ages ſince, which would have been
of greateſt Advantage to them in this
World. He has empower'd them, they
ſay, to remit Sins, which few old
Sinners think themſelves the leſs in
danger for: And he has enabled them,
ſome ſay, to tranſubſtantiate Bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Fleſh, and Wine into Blood,
which none but fooliſh and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Folks believe they ever did:
And he promiſed to inveſt them with
a Power to do greater Miracles than
himſelf, even to remove Mountains,
and to curſe Trees; but I thank God,
they never were of ſo ſtrong a Faith,
as to put it in Practice, or we might
have heard of the <hi>natural</hi> ſtate, as well
as we do now of the <hi>civil</hi> ſtate of ſome
Countrys, ruin'd and overturn'd by
them. But this Power to tranſmute
<hi>Water into Wine,</hi> without Labour and
Expence, would have been of better
worth to them, than all their other
Prieſtly Offices. Not, that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1207700400:50"/>
would thereupon run with Wine,
inſtead of Water; or that Wine would
be cheaper and more plentiful than it
is now, excepting among themſelves,
if they could withal curſe Vineyards.
They would make the beſt Penny
they could of their divine Power.
And as ſurely as they can now ſell
the Water-drops of their Fingers at a
Chriſtening, at a good Rate, they would
ſet a better Price on their miraculouſly
made Wine, and give a notable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for its dearneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that Miracles
ſhould not be <hi>cheap,</hi> which would
bring them into Contempt, and leſſen
the Wonder and Admiration of them.</p>

            <p>So ends the Invective of a ſuppos'd
Jewiſh <hi>Rabbi</hi> againſt this Miracle; which
our <hi>Divines,</hi> as well as myſelf, are to
conſider of an Anſwer to. Whether
they ſhall think themſelves able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the rational Parts of it, conſiſtently
with the Letter, I know not; but I
own myſelf unable, and believe it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for them, to do it: And therefore
they muſt of neceſſity go along with me

to take the Stories of the Marriages and
Concubinages of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the
Old Teſtament in a literal Senſe. And
indeed, literally conſider'd, they are ſome
of them too luſcious Tales to be related

               <note n="40" place="bottom">In Lib. de Abrahamo.</note> , turn theſe Stories, for the
Honour of God and Edification of his

if <hi>Juſtin</hi> had had an occaſion to ſpeak
of this Marriage before us, there's no

            <p>To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Origen</hi> 
               <note n="41" place="bottom">

"That ſince the Law is a ſhadow of

it of Marriages according to the Fleſh,

            <p>Other Fathers, ſuch as St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> St.
<hi>Theophylact</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome</hi> are of the ſame
mind about the myſtical Interpretation of
this Marriage, as might be prov'd by Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
out of them, if I had room here to
cite them. But I muſt obſerve here, that
according to the Fathers, the Story of this
Marriage is but another Emblem of the
Marriage of the Lamb with the Bride of
the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi>
to which all the Fowls of the
Air will be invited, that is, ſpiritual and
heavenly minded Chriſtians, who <note n="49" place="bottom">Volucres Coeli ſunt verè puri &amp; ad caeleſtis ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiae Cognitionem evolare parati. <hi>Clem. Alex. Strom. L.</hi> iv.</note> ſoar
and fly aloft in their divine and ſublime
Contemplations on the anagogical Senſe
of the Scriptures, which will exhibit thoſe
intellectual Dainties, they are there to be
entertain'd with.</p>
            <p>What I have here ſaid out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the Story of this Marriage, is
enough to quicken our <hi>Divines</hi> to ſearch
for the like myſtical Interpretation of
the whole. The Part of it that's moſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1207700400:57"/>
difficult to be ſpiritually expounded, is
that ſaying of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to his Mother,
<hi>Woman, what have I to do with thee?
mine Hour is not yet come.</hi> For the clear
Interpretation of which, I own, I meet
with little in the Fathers. But St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>
               <note n="50" place="bottom">Quid mihi &amp; tibi eſt, Mulier? Procul dubio, Fratres, latet ibi aliquid Myſterii. <hi>In Loc. Johan.</hi>
               </note> aſſures us, there's latent My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
in the words. How then ſhall we
come at it? Why, if we caſt away the
<hi>Interrogation,</hi> and look upon the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
as ellyptical, like an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of prophetical ones, the Senſe para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtically,
and agreeably to the reſt of
the Myſtery, ariſes thus: In anſwer to
the Woman of the Church's Expectation
of the Wine of the Spirit; <hi>Jeſus</hi> will
tell her or make her to underſtand of
what importance it is to her (and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
to be ſupply'd with that myſtical
Wine to her Edification, which it was
not his time to pour forth upon the
Church, till the Celebration of his Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
with her.</p>
            <p>And thus have I done with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s turning Water into Wine
at a Marriage of <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not an abſurd and offenſive
Story according to the Letter, let any
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1207700400:58"/>
one judge. If the ſuppoſed Jewiſh <hi>Rabbi</hi>
has forced a worſe Senſe upon it, than
it will naturally bear, our <hi>Clergy</hi> may
expoſtulate with him for it, which they
hardly will any otherwiſe than by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
againſt him, without Reaſon
and Authority. But in the myſtical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this Miracle at the Marriage of
Chriſt with his Church, there will be
the Wiſdom and Power and Goodneſs of
God viſible. And it will be a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s <hi>Meſſiahſhip,</hi> in as much
as the Water of the Letter of the Law
and the Prophets can't be turn'd into the
Wine of ſpiritual Interpretations, but we
muſt diſcern how he is the Accompliſher
and Fulfiller of them. And ſo I paſs to

               <note n="51" place="bottom">Matt. ix. Mark ii. Luke v.</note> That of his healing a Paralytick,
for whom the Roof of the Houſe was
broken up to let him down into the
Room where <hi>Jeſus</hi> was.</p>
            <p>And this Story (without excepting that
of the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi>) is the moſt
monſtrouſly abſurd, improbable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
of any according to the Letter.
There is not one Miracle of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically
related, that does not labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1207700400:59"/>
more or leſs Abſurdities, either in
Subſtance or Circumſtance: But this, for
number and greatneſs of Abſurdities, I
think ſurpaſſes them all: And the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
of it too are ſo obvious and ſtare
a Man in the Face, that I wonder they
are hitherto overlook'd, and that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and intelligent Perſons have not
before now heſitated and boggled at them.
If Intereſt had not blinded the Eyes of
our learned <hi>Clergy,</hi> they would eaſily
have deſcry'd the Incredibilities and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
of this Story; and in another
<hi>Impoſtor</hi>'s Caſe preſently have pointed
them out to the ridicule of his Admirers
and Adorers.</p>
            <p>If a Man was to torture his Brains for
the Invention of a romantick Tale of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
and ſurprizing Circumſtances,
that he might, withal, hope to palm for
a Truth, if it was but for a Week or a
Day, upon the Faith and Underſtanding
of the Credulous; he could never have
preſumed, I think, ſo far upon the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Intellects, as to imagine any
thing ſo groſly and notoriouſly contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to Senſe and Reaſon, would have
gone down with them, as is <hi>this</hi> before
us, which has paſs'd currently thro' ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages of the Church, has been read
with attention by the Learned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1207700400:60"/>
by the reſt of Chriſtians, without
any exception, heſitation, or doubt of
the Truth of it. In ſhort, ſo palpable is
the falſity of the Story of this Miracle,
that it requires no Sagacity to detect it;
and was it not for the ſake of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
more than to expoſe the Folly of
the <hi>Clergy</hi> in believing of it, I had never
beſtow'd the following Pains on it.</p>
            <p>The People, it ſeems, ſo preſs'd and
throng'd about the Door of the Houſe,
where <hi>Jeſus</hi> was, that the Paralytick and
his Bearers could not get near it. What
did they ſo throng and preſs for? Was
it to ſee <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was <hi>without Form
and Comelineſs,</hi> according to the Prophet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi>; or, who was one of the moſt
graceful of the Sons of Men, as <hi>Painters</hi>
and <hi>Publius Lentulus</hi> do deſcribe him?
This could not be the Reaſon of the
Croud. Tho a Perſon extraordinary, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Beauty or Deformity may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the Eyes of the People, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
too a Throng about him; yet this
could be no Reaſon for a <hi>Preſs</hi> about
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where he dwelt,
and was commonly ſeen and well known.</p>
            <p>Was it then to hear him preach?
Nor this neither. Tho an excellent
Preacher does ſometimes, and a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
one does oftener draw multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1207700400:61"/>
after him; yet <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
was without Honour at <hi>Capernaum,</hi>
his own Country; conſequently, it is
not to be ſuppoſed that, for his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
he was ſo much follow'd here, tho
we read, that he <hi>preach'd the Word unto
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it then to behold him working
of Miracles and curing of the diſeaſed?
This is the likelieſt Reaſon of the Crouds
and Throng about him. And perhaps
it was a Day appointed beforehand for
his healing of the diſeaſed, which might
occaſion a more than ordinary Concourſe
of the People. But then this Reaſon
would have induced the People to make
way for the <hi>Lame, Blind,</hi> and <hi>Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
to come to <hi>Jeſus</hi>; or they fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their own Hopes and Expectations of
ſeeing Miracles wrought; and acted more
unreaſonably than ever Mob did, or can
be ſuppoſed to do.</p>
            <p>But whatever was the Reaſon of this
tumultuous Crouding, which is hard to
be accounted for; it's ſaid, the poor
<hi>Paralytick</hi> with his Bearers could not
get to the Door of the Houſe for the
<hi>Preſs,</hi> and therefore in all haſte is he
haul'd to the Top of the Houſe, and let
down, thro' a breach of the Roof, into
the Room where <hi>Jeſus</hi> was. What need
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1207700400:62"/>
was there of ſuch haſte and pains to get
to <hi>Jeſus</hi> for a Cure? It was but wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a while, not many Hours, and in
all probability the Tumult would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd,
and acceſs eaſily had to him.
But that the Bearers of the poor Man
ſhould enterpriſe a trouble and difficulty
that could not require leſs Time, than
the Tumult could be ſuppoſed to laſt,
is a little ſtrange and ſomewhat incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays <note n="52" place="bottom">Paralyticus repletum videret Theatrum, Aditus intercluſos, Portum obſeptum,—Non tamen dixit Propinquis ſuis, quid hoc Rei eſt?

               </note> , that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytick</hi>
ſaw that the Market-place or
Street was throng'd with People, who
had obſtructed all Paſſage to the Houſe,
where <hi>Jeſus</hi> was; and yet he did not
ſo much as ſay to his Friends and Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
"What's the Reaſon of this Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult?
Let's ſtay till it is appeas'd,
and the Houſe clear'd of the People,
who ere long will depart; and then
we ſhall privately and quietly get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
to Jeſus." But why did he
not ſay ſo? Any one beſide himſelf and
his Bearers, if they had any Reaſon and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1207700400:63"/>
Senſes about them, would have ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued.
St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays, it was their
<hi>Faith</hi> that made them in ſuch haſte to
get to <hi>Jeſus:</hi> But I ſhould have thought,
their <hi>Faith</hi> might have work'd <hi>Patience,</hi>
and diſpoſed them to ſtay till Jeſus could
come out to them, or they get in to him:
And it is an Addition to the ſtrangeneſs
and incredibility of the Story, that it
did not.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing this <hi>Paralytick</hi> in ſuch
haſte and danger of Life, that he could
not wait the diſperſion of the Tumult,
but, for want of a free entrance at the
Door, is, coſt what it will, to be rais'd
to the top of the Houſe, and a breach
muſt be there made for him. The Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, whether ſuch an Enterprize was
or could be feiſable and practicable? I
have no Conception of the poſſibility of
it. If they could not get to the Door
of the Houſe for the Preſs; of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
they could not come at the Sides
of it. How ſhould they? over the Heads
of the People? That's not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;
conſequently here's another dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in the Story, that renders it yet
more ſtrange and incredible.</p>
            <p>But, without queſtioning the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and eaſineſs of getting the <hi>Parly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
and his Couch over the Heads of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1207700400:64"/>
the Mob, to the ſides of the Houſe; thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is brought, where we now behold
him and his Bearers with their Pullies,
Ropes, and Ladders (that were not at
hand, nor could ſuddenly be procured)
hauling and heaving him to the top of
the Houſe. Of what height the Houſe
was, is not of much Conſequence. Some
for the Credit of the Story may ſay
 <note n="53" place="bottom">Dicet aliquis valde dimiſſum fuiſſe Locum, à quo per Tegulas depoſuerunt Paralytici Lectum. <hi>Johan. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot. Hieroſ. in Loc. Luc.</hi>
               </note> , it was a <hi>very low one</hi>; tho antient
and modern <hi>Commentators</hi> are pretty well
agreed, that it was an <hi>upper-Room,</hi> where
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was; conſequently the Houſe was
at leaſt two Stories high: But if it was
much higher, I'll allow that Art and
Pullies (which they wanted for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
would raiſe the Man and his Bed
to the top of it: So we will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
nor differ upon that matter. On
the top of the Houſe then, we are now
to behold the <hi>Paralytick</hi> and his Bearers
with their Hatchets and Hammers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
(which they forgot to bring with them,
for they could not think of any uſe
they ſhould have of them) uncovering
the Roof of the Houſe; breaking up
<hi>Tiles, Spars,</hi> and <hi>Rafters,</hi> and making a
Hole, capacious enough for the Man and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1207700400:65"/>
his Bed to be let through. An odd, ſtrange,
and unaccountable Work <hi>this,</hi> which, if
they had not been cunning Fellows, would
hardly have enter'd into their Heads to
project. But at work they are, when it
was well, if Jeſus and his Diſciples e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
with a only broken Pate, by the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Tiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if the reſt were
not almoſt ſmother'd with the Duſt; for
it was over their Heads that the breach
was made. Where was the good Man of
the Houſe all this while? Would he
ſuffer his Houſe to be thus broken up,
and not command them to deſiſt from
their fooliſh and needleſs Attempt, till
the Mob was quell'd, and there was a free
entrance at the Door of his Houſe, which
could not be long firſt? Is there nothing
in all this, of difficulty and obſtruction
in the way of the belief of this Story?</p>
            <p>Some modern <hi>Commentators,</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of theſe difficulties in this Story,
and willing to reconcile Men to the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
belief of it, ſay, as <hi>Druſius</hi> 
               <note n="54" place="bottom">Judaeorum Tecta plana erant, &amp; non in Coni formam faſtigiata. <hi>In Loc. Luc.</hi>
               </note> did,
that the Houſes of <hi>Judaea</hi> were <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roof'd,</hi>
               <hi>and not ridg'd</hi>: And Doctors,

               <note n="55" place="bottom">
                  <hi>In Loc. Marci.</hi>
               </note> ſay, there was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1207700400:66"/>
a Door on their flat Roofs, by which the
<hi>Jews</hi> uſed to aſcend to the top of their
Houſes, where they diſcours'd on the
Law and religious Matters; and that it
was thro' ſuch a Door, by a little wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ſides of it, that the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick</hi>
was let down in the preſence of
<hi>Jeſus.</hi> To which Opinion I would yield,
if it was not liable to theſe Objections,
<hi>viz.</hi> that it is not reconcilable to what
St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, of <hi>their letting the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick
down thro' the Tiling with his
Couch, in the midſt, where Jeſus was</hi>;
nor hardly conſiſtent with what St. <hi>Mark</hi>
ſays, of their <hi>uncovering</hi> and <hi>breaking
up the Roof of the Houſe:</hi> which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> had never uſed,
if there had been a Door for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
by. But to indulge <hi>Lightfoot</hi> and
<hi>Whitby</hi> in their Notion; I may ask them,
what occaſion was there then of wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the door-way, and breaking down
the ſides of it? They'll ſay, becauſe the
Paſſage otherwiſe was too narrow, for the
Man's Couch to get thro'. Why then
did not they take him out of his Couch,
and let him down in a Blanket, a Chair,
or a Basket? Or rather, why did not
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> to prevent this Trouble and Damage
to the Houſe, aſcend thro' this Door, to
the Top of it, and there ſpeak the healing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1207700400:67"/>
Word to this poor Man? To ſay, that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> could not or would not go up to
the Paralytick, I would not, for Fear of
an Imputation of Blaſphemy againſt me.
Our <hi>Divines</hi> therefore are to look for,
what they'll hardly find, an Anſwer to
the ſaid Queſtion, which will conſiſt with
the Wiſdom, the Goodneſs and Honour of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>; or here will be another and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable
Bar to the Credibility of this
Story.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, there are more and greater Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultys
affecting the Credit of this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
on the ſide of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than any before
urg'd. Could not he, as it was antiently
 <note n="56" place="bottom">Numquid enim facilem illi potuit Acceſſum red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere? <hi>Apud Chryſoſtom. de hoc Paralyt.</hi>
               </note> objected, have made the Acceſs to
himſelf more eaſy? Could not he, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all this Trouble and Pains of getting
to the Top of the Houſe; and of breaking
up the Roof of it, have deſired or even
forc'd the People to make way for this
poor Man and his Bearers? This was not
impoſſible for him to do. If it was hard
for another; it was not for him, who was
omnipotent. He that could drive his
Thouſands before him out of the Temple;
and draw as many after him into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
might ſurely, by Force or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1207700400:68"/>
have made the People, how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonably
mobbiſh ſoever, to retreat. And
ſhy did he not? Without a good and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
Anſwer, which I can't conceive,
to this Queſtion, here is the moſt unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
and incredible part of the whole
Story, that reflects on the Wiſdom, the
Power and Goodneſs of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> If there
had been no other abſurd Circumſtances of
it, this is enough to ſpoil its Credit, ſo
far as that I believe it impoſſible for
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> with all their
Wit, Penetration and Sagacity to get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it.</p>
            <p>Believe then the Story of this Miracle,
thus taken to Pieces, who can? It is ſuch
an Accumulation of Abſurdities, Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
and Incredibilities, that a Man of
the moſt eaſy Faith, if he at all think,
can't digeſt. It's not credible, I ſaid, to
ſuppoſe, the People of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where
<hi>Jeſus</hi> dwelt, and was well known and
little admired, would at all <hi>preſs</hi> to ſee
or hear him: And if the occaſion of their
Concourſe was to behold his Miracles;
it is leſs reaſonable to think they would
tumultuate to their own diſappointment;
but rather make way for the diſeaſed, for
the ſatisfaction of their own Curioſity, to
come to him: And if they did mob it
to their own diſappointment, about the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1207700400:69"/>
Door of the Houſe; it was next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for the poor Man and his Couch
to be heav'd over their Heads, and rais'd
to the top of it: More unreaſonable yet
to think, the Maſter of the Houſe would
ſuffer the Roof of it to be ſo broken up:
But moſt of all againſt Reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>Jeſus</hi> would not give forth the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
word, and prevent all this Labour,
or by his divine Power diſperſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that the <hi>Paralytick</hi> might have preſent
and eaſy acceſs to him.</p>
            <p>Whether all this be not abſolutely
ſhocking of the Credit of this Story, let
my Readers judge. In my Opinion, no
Tale more monſtrouſly romantick can be
told. I don't here queſtion <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Power
to heal this Paralytick, nor the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs
of the Cure of him: The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of that Queſtion is ſaved me, by
the many other incredible Circumſtances
of the Story, which are ſuch a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to Senſe and Reaſon, as is not to
be equall'd, in any thing, that's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
receiv'd and believ'd by Mankind.
<hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, that there is nothing ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
which ſome of the Philoſophers have
not held. And they might and did, ſome
of them, hold groſs Abſurdities. But the
Letter of the Story of this Miracle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, which is the Object of the Faith
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1207700400:70"/>
of our learned Prieſthood at this Day, a is
match for the worſt of them.</p>
            <p>But as abſurd, as this Story is, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that our <hi>Clergy</hi> will be diſguſted at
my ludicrous diſplay of it; and that
Arch-Deacon <hi>Stubbs</hi> in particular will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
be ready to exclaim againſt me, and
ſay, that this is turning a <hi>miraculous
Fact,</hi> and a <hi>divine Teſtimony</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
into Ridicule. Whereupon it is
to be wiſh'd, <hi>that Arch-Deacon</hi> would
write, what would be a Pleaſure to ſee,
a Vindication of this Story. If he can
account for the poſſibility and credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Letter of it, he ſhall have
my leave to make another dull Speech
in <hi>Convocation</hi> againſt me. And it is not
unlikely, but he may ſay as much for
it, as another Man: For as the Story is
ſenſeleſs, ſo it is the better ſuited to his
Head and Brains. But if he don't, I
much queſtion, whether any other Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman
of more Wit will, appear in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it.</p>
            <p>So abſurd is the Letter of this Story,
that for the Honour of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
of his Goſpel, it is abſolutely
neceſſary to turn it into Allegory. To the
Fathers then, let us go for their help in
this Caſe. If they did not read me a better
Lecture upon this Miracle, than do our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1207700400:71"/>
modern <hi>Commentators,</hi> I ſhould be almoſt
tempted to renounce my Religion upon
it: But as they have rationally and
rightly inſtructed me in its true meaning,
ſo I retain my Chriſtian Faith, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Sublimity of the Myſtery, which
I am now to give an account of.</p>
            <p>By this <hi>Paralytick,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary</hi> 
               <note n="57" place="bottom">In Paralytico Gentium univerſitas offertur me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda. <hi>In Loc. Matt.</hi>

ſays, is to be underſtood <hi>Mankind</hi> of all
Nations, which opinion too the Fathers
held of the <hi>Paralytick,</hi> who was heal'd
at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda.</hi> And by his
Palſy is not meant any bodily Diſtemper,
but the ſpiritual Palſy of the Soul, that
is, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>

here to be a diſeaſe of the Soul.</p>
            <p>The Man ſick of the Palſy had <hi>four
Bearers.</hi> And who are they myſtically
in this Caſe? Why, the Fathers <note n="61" place="bottom">Sed qui ſun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to the top of the Houſe is Mankind,
thus paralytically diſeaſed, to be carry'd
by the four Evangeliſts, his Bearers. And
what then is this Houſe and its Top?
The Houſe of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the intellectual
Edifice of the World, otherwiſe call'd
Wiſdom's Houſe, of the beautiful Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of which the Scriptures prophetically
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1207700400:73"/>

            <p>Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> who is altogether a

ſays <note n="65" place="bottom">Et bene Domus Jeſu juxta alterius Evangeliſtae Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem tegulis eſſe contecta reperitur, quia ſub contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibili Literarum Velamine, ſi adſit, qui reſeret, divina ſpiritualis Gratiae Virtus invenietur.

               </note> , that by the <hi>Tiles</hi> of the Houſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1207700400:74"/>
ſpoken of in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> is meant the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the Scriptures, which is to be
laid open for the manifeſtation of Chriſt
and of divine Myſteries to the healing
of Man's ſpiritual Palſy, the unſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and diſſoluteneſs of his Morals and
Principles.</p>
            <p>So much, in ſhort, then to the myſtical
Interpretation of the Story of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.
The literal Senſe of it is ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd
with romantick Circumſtances,
as are enough to turn a Man's Heart
againſt Chriſtianity it ſelf: But in the
Myſtery there will be a moſt ſtupendous
Miracle, which will be not only an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s divine Power, but of
his <hi>Meſſiahſhip,</hi> as certainly as his Houſe
of Wiſdom, of which the Scriptures
write, is open'd to the Manifeſtation of
his Preſence, and to the Cure of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
of his paralytical Diſeaſe, call'd an
inſtability of Faith and Principles.</p>
            <p>And thus have I, in this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi>
taken into Examination three more of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles; which I ſubmit to the
Judgment of my Readers, whether the
literal Story of them does not conſiſt of
Abſurdities, Improbabilities and Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilites
according to the Propoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us; and whether there is not a
neceſſity, for the Honour of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1207700400:75"/>
turn them into prophetical and parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Narratives of what will be myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
and more wonderfully done by
him.</p>
            <p>My next <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> if my mind hold,
ſhall treat on the three Stories of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
raiſing of the dead, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Widow
of <hi>Naim</hi>'s Son, of <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter, and
of <hi>Lazarus</hi>; after which I will give the
literal Hiſtory of Chriſt's Reſurrection,
that ſandy Foundation of the Church, a
Review; and ſo conclude my Diſcourſes
on the Miracles of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>To run thro' all the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
and handle them in the manner I have
done the foregoing, would be a long and
tedious Work. But if our <hi>Divines</hi> ſhall
think, I have ſelected only thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which are obnoxious to Cavil and
Ridicule; and have omitted others, that
literally are a more unexceptionable
Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s divine Power, and
Authority; I will, for their Satisfaction,
take more of them to Task, and give
the Letter of their Stories, the like ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous
treatment. If I miſtake not, the
Miracles already ſpoken to, together with
thoſe of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s raiſing of the dead, and
of his own Reſurrection, are the moſt
famous and remarkable of any others:
And according to the Obſervation I have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1207700400:76"/>
made on the reſt, they are no leſs but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more liable to Ridicule and Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But if any are of a contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and will let me know, which in
their Judgment are more unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Miracles, I will vouchſafe them
an Examination. I am ſure there is not
one Miracle, which the Fathers of the
Church did not turn into Allegory; and
if we don't at this Day make myſtical
Operations of them, they will none of
them, according to the Letter, ſtand their
Ground, nor abide the Teſt of a critical
Inquiry into them.</p>
            <p>I don't expect, that this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> will
be any more pleaſing and acceptable to
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who are <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles, as well as of the
Prophecies of him, than any of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
But their Diſpleaſure in the Caſe
will give me no Diſturbance, nor am I
concern'd about any Reſentment, they
can make of it. If they are offended at
theſe <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> they ſhould as they came
forth, have written ſolid Confutations
of them, and ſo have prevented my Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of any more of this kind: But
inſtead of ſerious and potent Reaſonings
againſt me, I have met with little elſe
but oral Railings, Exclamations, Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
and attempts for Proſecution;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1207700400:77"/>
which have been ſo far from terrifying
me, that they give me a ſecret Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and animate me to proceed in the
Undertaking in hand.</p>
            <p>I did not much queſtion but the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> whom I look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a Perſon of Ingenuity and Learning
would, before this Time, have publiſh'd
ſomewhat in Confutation of one or other
of my former <hi>Diſcourſes.</hi> Whether he
was not obliged to it, or to make me
ſome publick Reparation of the Injury
done to my Reputation, by his ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Sermon, I appeal now to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful
<hi>Societys</hi> for Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
to whom, and to other Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
I hope his Sermon, without
Reaſon, will be a Caution, that no Pulpit-Invective
move them to proſecute or
think the worſe of any Author.</p>
            <p>Liberty of thinking, writing and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for our ſelves in Religion is a natural,
a Chriſtian, and a proteſtant <hi>Right.</hi> It is
a <hi>Right</hi> that the Magiſtrate as well as the
Subject are intereſted in, and are to ſee
to the Conſervation of, or their Under-ſtandings
as well as their Purſes will be
ridden and oppreſs'd by an ignorant and
tyrannical Prieſthood. I urge not this
for my own ſecurity againſt Proſecution
for Infidelity and Blaſphemy, declaring
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1207700400:78"/>
that if the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi>
or <hi>Arch-Deacon Stubbs,</hi> who are
zealous for Perſecution, will but engage
me on the Stage of Controverſy, and
make good their Accuſations againſt me,
I will ſubmit to the worſt Puniſhment,
that can be inflicted on the worſt Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I will go on with
my Undertaking, to the advancement of
Truth, and demonſtration of the <hi>Meſſiah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
of the Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to whom be
Glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
